5,Great product,It was everything expected. Delieved in great time and we couldnt be happier. We would do business with again. Thanks
3,It is not what I thought.,"I thought that I was ordering the pictured item which is exactly what I am needing,but instead I did recieved an extension cable for the xbox, but it is squared on both ends. I am needing the one that is in the picture which is one side squared and the other side circled. I thought about sending it back, but decided against it because we can use the extension. I am just upset that I didn't receive what I thought they were offering on the picture. They were very quick on the delivery too also that made my son happy which makes me happy!!!!!"
1,This is a complete waste of money.,"For the past 5 years I have been an elementary music teacher. I had 150 bucks to spend from my PTA and I really enjoy working with Sibelius notation software,however, this paticular product is an absolute waste."
1,disillusioned and disappointed,I'm very dissappointed that the angled wand does not fit onto the 4 piece extension. It makes it usless when cleaning siding above the first floor. Its listed as often being purchased along with the 4 piece extension which is very misleading. I'm dissappointed with Amazon for that.
1,Don't Bother,"When I read this book, I got the feeling that George Barna was speaking into a tape recorder, rambling on about his concerns. He has a reputation as a researcher, yet he bases his conclusions on his thoughts and feelings as a father of young children and not on any solid research. And when he does reference the research, he makes huge jumps in logic to reach some debatable conclusions. I think this book harms the cause, with readers, myself included, questioning all of Barna's conclusions, valid or not. Skip this book; it'll just make you mad."
1,You've GOT to be kidding,"It's a joke to say ""No one can deny that our culture is opposed to Christian values, and the influences bombarding our children's moral development can be deadly""---Our culture in inundated with ""Christian"" values judging us and our children, teaching intolerance, and bigotry. Teach your children that they are part of a bigger picture that includes EVERYONE, not that they are superior, or that they will be punished by GOD. I became a much more responsible (i.e., moral) citizen of the world when I stopped trying to do right because I'd be punished, but rather did right because it was right!"
5,Challenges,The Barna Group has given me new insight to how important children's ministry really is. Armed with this I have encouraged our church to make Children's ministry it's priority for the future.
5,Great for Parents and Teachers,"George Barna is a Christian revolutionary in the best sense of the word. His insightful commentary, statistical analysis, and vision for success are inspiring and He provides great direction for any children's ministry in this quick reading book."
5,Best tool I've seen for children's ministry leaders & also parents,Thorough research to back up claims that children's ministry should be the most important ministry in our churches. Valuable statistics and survey data. Practical steps for transforming a children's ministry or your own children.
2,Save your money,"This is not up to Barna's usual standards. It is not a representation of well-researched data with a good analysis. It's a collection of personal thoughts and musings.About a half-dozen of Barna's books are on my bookshelf, I normally enjoy his work. This book is a dud. It lacks compelling factual arguments, and has little in the way of practcal application."
1,read valueless and missingprose,"What a very mixed bag of stories are to be found in this book. Mixed in themes and mixed in quality. I must agree with the reviewers that picked out the original but somewhat unpolished Gift as the finest story, the polished but not quite original Hare's Path is also worthy of any reader's attention.The rest would find no place in this reader's Christmas stocking"
1,boreing,My freind lent me her copy. I didnot like it much. Some of the stories are really miserable and boreing. She lent it to me because she could not finish it.
2,Where to place the Mistletoe,"This is the worst anthology I've read yet. Most stories were boring and poorly written. I'll give it 2 stars... one for The Hare's Path, the other for The Gift... by far the only good stories in the whole collection."
3,Disappoint changed,"I just own this book last month. I recommend this for people who have some knowledge of XML and fresh to database. It is a good book for beginner. But one thing that I don't like because an e-book on the CDROM is open Acrobat. To complicated, i need to install acrobat first. The picture and text is not clear. Unlike the previous e-books which create in CHM file format is very good. The text and image is very clear and easy to copy. I don't know why Microsoft changed to this bad style. I like to read the book in the CDROM because it is easy than hold the heavy book to read while learning."
3,I think you forgot something!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I received this product along with Access 2003 for Dummies 9 in 1, and was not only dissapointed in how long it took to receive the items, but this item came incomplete. It was suppose to have a CD rom for training purposes with the book, but did not come with it. I contacted the vendor by email and a few days later received an Email from Amazon telling me they were going to refund me my full purchase price. Well Amazon did exactly that. Nice job Amazon. You are true to your satisfaction guaranteed. Unfortunately; I really needed the CD more than a refund. But thank you Amazon. Not happy with this vendor!"
2,For Novices Only,"I bought this book with the hope that it would show how to build a database from scratch. I was sorely disappointed. I am a technical professional, but while I expect the learning curve to be relatively flat, I'm really at a standing start when it comes to databases in general and Access in particular. Hence the appeal of the book. But this title really doesn't go much farther than showing you how to do wizard-based stuff. If you know absolutely nothing about Access when you start this book, you'll be nominally north of that when you finish, but not much more. If you really wanna learn Access, this book won't do it."
1,Disappointed Teacher,I wish I had read the reviews prior to purchasing the book. The title is very misleading. Basically it is a review of what Access can do...I was looking for a more hands on approach.
2,This book tells you what to do but does not explain why...,"As the title explains, it does take you step by step on doing a few simple tasks but it does not explain what the reasons for...primary keys for example, it just tells you to pick a primary key for this task but on another taks it will tell you not to pick a primary key. What good does knowing how to change a ""primary key"" when you dont know what it does or what the ramifications are. The same goes for a lot of things that the book tells you do do but doesnt explain why you are doing it."
2,Not a very good book despite the name,"This book doesn't teach you access to any depth. Lots of fluff but no real meat. Don't spend $27 and waste your time. If you want to learn or master access, check out Alison Balter book ""Mastering Microsoft Office Access 2003""."
2,This book is in ENGLISH only !! Be Warned !,"I bought this book after reading Elizabeth Wu's listmania..There are some deceptive chinese characters shown in the sample pages so I figured it would be in Chinese, maybe pinyin and the english translation !! Bad Mistake..!! If you are a reader on Chinese, its not fulfilling to read it only in English."
4,Fabulous,"I'm very glad I selected this screen protector. I hated having to constantly clean the touch screen and this screen protector really prevents fingerprints as promised. The anti-glare works well for my vision. I have not removed the protector to clean it yet, so I can't comment on that feature."
1,"Work harder, Random House!","This 2005 edition (ISBN:0375426000) has an error in print (on page 1424-1425).The definition of ""zip"" was almost completely erased and just left a meaning about computer files. What a blunder! I sincerely hope Random House would correct this ""bug"" while reprinting or reissuing."
3,Good Enough,"This rice cooker is a bit messy on 3-4 cup end. A lot of spewing and overflowing, however, being stainless it easy to clean. Also, you have to play with the recipes a bit, usually more water is needed. I do like the spring retrieval on the power cord. More appliances need these."
2,Very messy; cleanup is awful,"We've had this rice cooker for over a year and use it frequently. The good ~ it looks nice and has a retractable cord. The rice basket is non-stick and very easy to clean. I've never had any problems with burnt rice or rice sticking to the bottom. It also cooks rice fairly quickly.The bad ~ unless you use the steamer basket every time you cook rice (even if you're not steaming anything), water boils out of the lid making a complete mess of the cooker and counter. The starch from the rice coats the outside of the unit. A sticky, gooey mess that's not fun cleanup.I would not recommend this rice cooker - especially for the price. There are less expensive, better designed cookers out there."
2,Messy Rice Cooker,"it dries out the rice on the warm setting. When the water steams its gets all around the rim of the cooker. The instructions are not accurate- too dry for the rice. I should have bought a Zojirushi. They do not dry out the rice on the ""warm""setting because of the way the lid traps out the air."
1,Not worth anything,"Save your money and buy a different brand. This burns and solidifies the rice at the bottom of the pot and leaves the rest not fit for consumption. It does a great job of steaming in the upper chamber, but just leave the rice out. I even sent my first one back to Cuisinart as defective. The replacement Cuisinart rice cooker? Burned the rice just as efficiently as the first one! Cuisinart missed the boat on this one!"
2,OK for white rice... but on-switch broke (no repair possible),This unit does a great job with white rice... HOWEVER as many reviews note it is not good with brown rice. It did not work for other grains I tried such as bulgar wheat. So it was usable BUT... after four years AND not a lot of use.. the spring loaded ON-SWITCH broke. Cuisinart offers no repairs for this problem. They were nice on the phone.
2,Should have been great but...,"I purchased this rice cooker for my daughter to take to college. We tried it out ahead of time to see how it would work. I have owned two rice pots in the last 30 years. Each has made perfect rice. Each lasted way longer than I had the right to expect.This little pot was cute and compact but the water overflowed every time we cooked leaving goopy liquid on the lid, down the side of the pot and on the counter. We reduced the water (which does not really work when you are trying for perfect sushi rice) and the problem was reduced but not eliminated. If you are interested in anything but dry rice, select another rice cooker."
1,makes a mess!,"My husband bought this for me as a gift. I specifically asked for cuisinart because most of their products are high quality but not this one. The handle broke off of the lid after the second use. My husband blamed me, as though I had not been carefull enough with it but he soon realized after several uses that this is just a piece of garbage appliance. I had to look at all the other reviews on Amazon to make sure it wasnt just mine and low and behold everyone else is having the same problems. When you cook rice in this it overflows everywhere. Slimy sticky rice water overflows all over the counter and continues to pour out until it switches to warm. The more I use it the worse it gets each time. Im throwing mine away. I have a cuisinart food processor and I cant believe its made by the same company. I love love love my food processor but this rice cooker is junk!"
2,Not in My kitchen!,"This is poorly designed and messy. It doesn't cook even a quarter cup of rice without steaming over the sides and when it shuts off to ""warm"" there is a strong residue of cooked rice liquid on the bottom that results in a fair amount of lost food. I find it a pain in the neck and am looking for a decent closed environment for rice cooking. That seems to make sense to me. And they can be had for just a tad more."
3,Rice Cooker Overflow Problems,"I don't know what I am doing wrong. Cuisinart wasn't much help. When cooking only 2 cups of rice in 2 cups of water and after washing the rice, my cooker still overflows, making my counter a mess. Also, the rice is lumpy and looks like I could make sushi with it. It cooks for so long--I timed the cooker at 30 minutes before warm came on. This is second one. I traded the first one because I was told the heating element might be bad--but the second one does the same thing. I thought rice cookers were great--doesn't anyone know of a ""great"" one! Very disappointed in this concept--I cook rice better on the stove but I thought this would be a help. Do manufacturers actually test market their products--if so, they must know a secret that I don't!"
4,Fantastic value,"This rice cooker is the best if you want no fuss. I previously owned a Panasonic (for double the money) with all the bells and whistles and 10 different settings and if you didn't program it precisely,the rice was a disaster and their steamer basket was plastic and stained easily. I had to get rid of that one. The Cuisinart is simple and I have never been disappointed with the results. Great for steaming veggies too(in a stainless steel basket)while you prepare your rice. Great size, it's small enough to be on the counter,prepares 8-15 cups of rice and coordinates with any other small appliances from the Cuisinart line. I have been extremely happy with this product and would tell anyone that is interested in a rice cooker to look no further, this is the perfect product."
1,"Too Messy, and dry rice on the bottom.","I used my new cuisinart 8 cup rice cooker for the first time this evening and am very dissapointed with it. I followed the instructions to the letter and ended up with the thick rice liquid spilling over onto the lid and splattering all over the rice cooker and some onto the counter. When it was done there was a thick dry layer of rice on the bottom that couldn't be eaten, very wasteful.I only cooked 2 cups, I wonder how much mess I would have had if I had cooked more than that! I plan on calling Cuisinart about the problems I am having."
1,The worst appliance I have ever owned.,"The Good -It looks nice on the counter.The Bad -Design of lid makes it very difficult to clean.The Ugly -Brown crust forms on bottom of rice no matter how long you cook it. Starchy water spews out from the top while rice is cooking. Sprays outside of machine and kitchen counter.The Completely Unacceptable -Corporate customer service is a disgrace. It took them three weeks to respond to an email submitted though their website. In the response, they asked for the specific date of purchase (it was in October 2007). I emailed back the same day and now another three weeks has passed without hearing from them.The Bottom Line -The machine is crappy, the customer service worse."
1,Very disappointed,"Wow. I have owned a lot of rice cookers. My last one died, and I figured I'd splurge... My cheapies have always been a little messy, and they burned the rice. This one is WAY messy and also burns the rice.The mess is beyond what I could've expected. Rice sludge EVERYWHERE. It overflows the pot, oozes down the sides, and onto the counter. I can put something under it, but it STILL is all over the cooker. My $20 cooker never did this, and at least then I had no true remorse when I needed to replace it.This cooker is pretty. I like the size of the steamer tray, and how it rests on top of the pot. That's about all I'll say that's positive about it.I'm sorry I spent the extra money... it wasn't worth it."
2,Burns rice even w/ more h20,"Bought one recently from a Mervyns sale. Rice burned especially at the bottom (black & crunchy). So I returned and got another one in case the 1st one was defective. Nope, did the same thing. So next go around, I added more water, but still the rice tasted funny- a burned taste- although the rice didn't burn as much this time. For the cost and design, I was hoping this would be a great rice cooker. Design element is cool especially wiith the retractable cord, however, this cooker can't even perfom its main purpose- just plainly cook rice without burning it. Yes, I did add enough water and followed instructions and used the measuring cup. Hopefully they'll improve it. Better yet, maybe Krups can design a better abd sleek-looking yet working rice cooker."
2,It's true......,"The darn thing sputters a mess all over....and this was just from cooking two small 'cups' of rice. Next time, I'm going for quality (iow- gettin a zoji) instead of looks.... ugh!"
3,"For the price, it's OK, but...","We've had this steamer for 2 years & while it does a nice job of steaming veggies, the rice results are inconsistent. To get the rice cooked seems to require more water than the directions call for. This might be because a lot of steam escapes during the cooking process (and there's often a watery 'overflow' onto the counter, too). Once the rice is cooked, you need to remove it w/in 10-15 min. or you get a brown ""crust"" on the bottom (not burned exactly, but unpleasantly browned). I've decided to move up to a higher quality steamer after 2 years of struggling with this one..."
1,Spews steam and gooey water all over the counter,"This is a dangerous counter top appliance due to the steam spewing out of the lid. I don't have children at home or I would not use it. All I want to do is cook brown rice every day, and it is more trouble then its worth. I wrote one letter to Cuisinart, but the company has not responded to my complaints.I do not recommed this product because it is faulty design."
3,"Ok, if you like crispy rice","This was my first rice cooker, and I've used it a lot since buying it. It's fast, convenient, looks nice and clean up is pretty easy. I used the steamer for a chicken dish, and that turned out great. I have two problems with it: 1) water leaks out the top and runs down the side of the cooker almost every time. You need to put a lot of butter in it to keep this from happening. The rice tastes great if you do this, but it's probably not very healthy, and 2) a portion of the rice is almost always crispy. I think the rice at the bottom of the cooker gets burnt, although it doesn't appear burnt. All I know is that no matter how much water I add, I still get crunchy rice. My boyfriend likes it that way, so it doesn't bother him, but it drives me crazy."
4,Quality Product,"This rice cooker has consistently made evenly and properly cooked rice with viturally painless cleanup. After using this cooker with it's non-stick bowl, I wonder why I bothered with my previous alumininum bowled cooker. This cooker is far easier to clean. It also saves me the hassle from cooking on a stovetop, so I can focus more on my entres.What I would do to perfect this product is to have a variable setting for different styles of rice, e.g. sticky rice. Of course, this feature is found on products at a higher price point. Those cookers, however, do not have the style that this product has."
1,Waste of money. Stay away from this item,"This is the worst rice cooker I've ever used! I'm Asian, so I know what a good cooked rice should be like. This rice cooker does not cook!! Rice always come out undercook. I tried following the direction in the manual, tried different ratios of rice vs water, followed instruction in the rice package, tried different type of rice. IT ALWAYS UNDERCOOKED!You're better off buying a non-branded rice cooker from your chinese supermarket or store."
1,overflowed,"water spilled out every time, followed directions and measured carefully. Surprised that it wasn't better considering the brand."
1,Don't buy this,"Not a good choice-must be watched to make sure it doesn't boil over, didn't switch to warm automatically & burns. Spend a little more $$ and get a programmable unit if you cook rice often."
5,Good for two people or small family's,does not make a lot of food. If you plan to make rice and vegetables for more then two people -forget it. Otherwise a great machine and looks very stylish and looks good anywhere in the kitchen. It is small too!
1,"Unreliable, broken after 6 months","We bought this cooker from Linen N' things. And after using it for about 6 months. It's already broken. Even if it's not broken, I won't recommend it, -- rice may be under-cooked, overflow problem. And we got perfect rice once in a while only. And strangely, the amount of rice, water that we used are the same all the time. Good luck with those who got it."
2,Disapointed,"I am very disapointed with this rice cooker. We got it for our shower and it showed a lot of promise. Well, everytime the rice has an extra inch of water on top, even when we reduced the amount of water we put in it by 1/2. I have tried everything and the rice has turned out good 1 out of 10 times. The spring also doesn't work. So, the Cook button will not stay down anymore."
2,Not worth the packaging,Real junk .. albeit good-looking. Fell apart after 1 month of use. We replaced it with a 10-dollar cooker from Walgreens that still works.
1,Returning it,"I received this for Christmas and am returning it after 5 attempts. Three times we tried brown rice, and it never turned out -- it was never done enough, even when I put extra water in. The two times I've made white rice, it had a hard crust on the bottom. If I wanted bad rice, I would stick with my stovetop method. I'm going to go buy a higher end machine."
3,Good for single people only,"I love the Cuisinart brand, and have many, many of their products. I like the recipe book it comes with, and it definitely doesn't assume that all you want to cook is white rice, which I appreciate. It is, however, easily overloaded and boils over making one heck of a mess if you need anything more than 3-4 servings. I'm happy to give it to my cousin who is single, but for my family of 5, it will definitely not do."
3,Boiling over issue,"I bought this Cuisinart CRC-400 Rice Cooker in hopes of it being better than the cheaper brands. The first 3-4 times i made rice I had to experiment with it due to it boiling the water around the lid each time. There's no adjusting the heat or anything. So, reading the owners manual I found out a couple things. I'm a bachelor so I was trying to make single potions. (Which it doesn't recommend) After making larger portions and still having the same issue I experimented again. I measured 2 cups of normal rice using the supplied cup and filled it with the suggested amount of water. I let the rice soak for 30 minutes in cold water (Without plugging it in) then plugged it in and.............what do you know. Good rice without any boiling over issues"
2,Boils over for just 1 cup,"This was to replace a small 4 cup cooker my mom gave me over 10 years ago and worked well until earlier this year. I bought it without checking the reviews until I had it. It's either hate it or love it so I figured I should give it a chance. I tested it by cooking one cup of rice and it made a pretty decent mess. My old one was small but made 4 cups of good rice without a huge mess until the end. I figured I should be ok since Cuisinart is supposed to be a pretty reliable brand, but I'm afraid this particular product is going back. I have another Cuisinart product that works well. It's simply the design of this one that's poor."
1,Terrible design,"These are the most awful rice cookers on the market! They make a huge mess, hot rice water floods the counter and runs onto floor. I have tried to cut the amount of water it still runs all over. So I wrap the bottom of the cooker with towels to save the floor. Don't buy it. Warm setting makes a thick crust on the bottom of the rice container also. So you have to use all the rice or take it out of cooker when done. Terrible design. Disappointed in the brand for this design."
2,overflowing,"It is cute and space saver but I've never been able to cook 4 cups of rice in there because it was overflowing, over time the situation became gradually worst, and now (after around 2 years of use 5 times a week) it is overflowing even with 1.5 cup of rice..."
1,cuisinart 8 cup rice steamer,"What a hell of a mess! The water and rice goop boils over and drips all over the outside of the steamer, and all over the counter!The cover doesn't fit tight and bounces up and down while the rice boils and cooks.Terrible mess to clean up every time I make rice. The finished cooked rice has a film on it and is clumped together. I have a lot of Cuisinart products, but this one is a horror show. Back to the drawing board on this one guys!"
1,Extremely Messy,"We lived in Asia for five years and we eat a lot of rice. In Asia we owned a very cheap rice cooker that worked perfectly well (but different voltage). When we returned to the USA, I purchased the cuisinart 8-cup rice cooker (CRC-800) thinking I was getting ""top of the line."" It made such an enormous mess every time we used it, so I called cuisnart to find out if somehow (despite meticulous reading of the instructions) we were doing something wrong. No, it seemed we were doing everything correctly. So we tried a few more times, and then in exasperation returned the rice cooker for a new one. We thought given the generally good quality of cuisinart appliances, this one must be defective.Well the new one does the same thing! I give up. Enough of the messes. I got so frustrated I sent cuisinart a picture. C'mon this is not high-tech stuff! Get it right or take it off the market."
1,"poorly executed, good idea","A messy device. The lid fits poorly on the pot, better on the steamer accessory. Boilover is a problem, even with a partial load. Hard to handle the steamer/lid to add to pot or to steamer. Steamer construction traps particles in the bead of the steamer, difficult to clean. I can make good food with it, but for the price, I can do as well with my Lodge stovetop dutch oven, with much less mess."
1,Hands down the worst rice cooker ever made!!!,"This is a very nice looking rice cooker but it stops there. I have had alot of rice cookers over the years and this one caught my eye!! I thought because of the price this was that bad boy of rice cookers but to my surprise it turned out to be the biggest piece of JUNK EVER!!! It cooks the rice fast but makes a mess a very big mess every single time!! It must be a design flaw because the milky part of the rice while cooking over flows and spatters all over the place. I read if you use the steam tray it will help elimInate the problem, but it doesn't help the least bit. IF YOU ARE IN THE MARKET FOR A RICE COOKER DO NOT BUY THE FOUR OR EIGHT CUP CUISINART RICE COOKER YOU WILL BE VERY DISAPPOINTED, SAVE YOUR MONEY!!!"
3,"Sleek, but Underperforms","I just purchased the Cuisinart CRC-400 rice cooker. The first try yielded messy results as the top was gurgling during the boiling phase causing starchy water to get all over the unit and the counter. The second time using it I employed the steamer tray and that virtually eliminated the ""boiling over"" problem. I would say the rice cooker does what it is supposed to do, but their measurements may be a little low on the water content in some recipes. (my brown rice came out a little undercooked) The steamer tray works well and should be used even when not steaming to keep down the mess. 4 cups is really not a lot of rice and I wish I had gone for a larger model. Overall, it looks sleek, but I feel like I could have gotten a unit of the same size and ability with a smaller price tag."
3,Rice Cooker,"Its a great LITTLE cooker, you can cook really only two cups of rice. It does a good job and I like it. The one thing you cannot do that you can do in BIG cookers is come back the next day and have fresh rice. This unit will not allow that. All in all a 5.5."
1,Big Mess,If you follow the instructions you will have a pool of very difficult to clean starch water all over your counter top and cooker. When I contacted Cuisinart about this I was basically told to get lost. Beware; this is a defective product!
2,I expect more from Cuisinart,"I love using the rice cooker. The rice turns out perfect every time. However, no matter which recipe I use, it over flows onto the counter.The shape is great, the squareness of it makes it easy to store. I still use it all the time, I just make sure that there isn't anything near it when it cooks. The only other complaint I have is that there is not an off switch, you have to unplug it after every use. Maybe they are all like that, I do not know, this is the only one I have ever used.I love the retractable cord!!! Rice is perfectly cooked and appliance is easy to store. Too bad it makes such a mess, I expected more from Cuisinart."
4,Good product,"Some design flaws such as no handles on the interior cooking pot. The lid does not fit tightly over top of pot. Have to take lid off for a few minutes until the water cooks down to point where won't boil over when cooking rice. I like that the steamer bowl is stainless steel and not plastic. Easy to clean and store with retractable cord. Overall a pretty good product, but a little over priced."
3,Cuisinart CRC-400,The product looks nice but It should have a pressure released valve on the cap rather than a hole and the cap has not sealed well.
3,Performance questionable,"This is a well designed, attractive unit to use as an extra, helpful kitchen appliance. It's particularly good for steaming a single portion of vegetables. For rice is only so-so, not much better than just doing it the old fashion way on the stove. In my first experience carefully following the instructions and measurements, the water/rice mixture overflowed and made a mess well down inside the unit. The instructions emphasize to always point the steam exhaust toward the back. Now I know why, it will spit all over you and your kitchen floor if you don't."
2,spilled over,I bought this as a gift for my brother he didn't like it to much because it would spill all down the sides with a sticky mess. the rice was ok nothing special
5,"Great appliance, used right!",I love this thing! I've happily used mine for several years now. The secret to it not running over is to put a little butter into it along with the rice and water. Try it!
2,messy rice cooker,"I purchased this rice cooker about two months ago and am disappointed.I read and followed all instructions and still had trouble. It does a wonderful job cooking the rice and the end result is good, however, it splashes sticky rice water all over. I even read the other reviews that said to spray non-stick cooking spray on the pot before turning on -doesn't help.Also, I ran the cooker with different amounts of rice and water. One cup all the up to four cups. Four cups really make a mess. I did not rate it one star because of the design and overall appearance of the unit, which in my opinion are stylish and modern. I confess, this , along with the brand were the reasons I purchased this rice cooker. Go with a top rated version with a locking lid and save your money. Wish I would have!"
1,Underside of Lid Rim Traps Water,"It took me a couple of days to figure out that the underside of the lid rim has a gap that traps water either from cooking or washing. There is no way to release the water from the underside of the rim and who wants to use a lid that has trapped water that can drip into the cooker. I have tried everything to get the trapped water from underneath the inside rim, but to no avail. While water also traps underneath the knob, you can always remove the screw and clean and dry before re-screwing it. Buyer beware."
2,ARGH! Bad engineering!,"We use this rice cooker ALL of the time. But 3 times now, we've forgotten to put the liner back in the rice cooker, and have gone ahead and poured the rice and water in the cooker without the bowl. No biggy, you would think, except that when you do that, the rice (and water, in my husband's case) get in the engine, and are near impossible to get out. I've taken it apart, and the fiberglass insulation has began molding and is impossible to clean out.What is otherwise a fantastic item has a small glitch for people that are in a rush to cook and sometimes ""slip up"" on having everything in place. If you're super thorough, great!"
2,Poor design,"It looks nice, but whoever built this didn't expect it to be used.As mentioned in other reviews, the water boils over if you don't add butter or oil. What this really means is that you will have rice-water spattering everything nearby, even if you're only cooking one cup of rice.The lid seems mismatched to the bowl. It doesn't quite sit right, so you have steam escaping out one side as well as out of the ""steam hole"". The knob on top of the lid gets pretty hot, so you have to have a hot pad to open it.There's nowhere to put the rice paddle. Most rice cookers have a place to put the scoop. (You're supposed to ""fluff"" the rice a few minutes after it finishes cooking; it's nice to be able to put the paddle somewhere other than the counter top.) Due to the shape of the lid, you can't even set it on top.It looks nice, and it cooks rice, but the design is terrible. Buy something else."
2,DON'T BUY IT!,"I am editing my first review:""This is my first rice cooker, and I will echo what others say about it: A TOTAL MESS! I follow the rice/water measurements exactly as it states in the manual, and the water STILL boils over and under the lid. I put the cooker on top of a plate to catch the water. It's a pain to clean up the water stains on the stainless steel.""I can now say that I've gotten rid of this rice cooker. Besides being totally messy, the plastic in the cover knob completely cracked in half -- this cooker was purchased less than a year ago. I have now purchased a Panasonic rice cooker with a sealable cover based on good reviews on this website.For a company known for it's ""high end"" stuff, this rice cooker is junk. I now rate this product NO STARS."
3,Marginal design equals marginal performance,"It cooks the rice. Otherwise, I'm not so happy.1) It tends to boil over (adding oil or butter helps -- but so would good design).2) It scorches when I use stock instead of water.3) You have to be there to unplug it, there's no auto-shutoff, although it will go into permanent warming mode.4) You have to load it before plugging it in, otherwise it goes right into warming mode.5) The cooking directions are wrong (what? it's a rice cooker) -- use the directions on the rice, not in the book.6) The lid doesn't fit. Not on the pot, and not on the steamer.7) The ""cool"" extra steamer gadget overcooks everything -- other than riceSo go with the Zojirushi systems -- they're made by pros."
1,Hate It!,"I absolutely hate this product. We own several Cuisinart appliances and are quite happy with them, but this rice cooker is horrible. I have yet to cook a good pot of rice. The pot steams over, leaving a coating of starchy rice water everywhere. The rice is either moist and sticky, undercooked or burnt on the bottom. I would not recommend this to anyone."
2,Disappointed,"Needed a replacement for our Zojirushi model NMDC-R18 that we had for approx 10 years. We enjoyed rice once or twice a week till our old model went on the fritz. This Cuisinart model seemed to offer some nice features with the steaming capability, and was a good price. However, we found some deficiencies. Most disappointing is the texture of the rice - not soft and sticky like we would like. Also, the bottom layer of rice is crispy immediately, and if left to warm even fifteen or twenty minutes its brown. Another problem is that once the unit begins cooking, the lid handle is too hot ""to handle"". You need a hot pad to take the lid off. After using this model twice we are returning it and going back to the Zojirushi brand."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS THING,"We've had this rice cooker for more than 4 years. It's terrifyingly bad. It creates a mess worse than my 3-year old after he's grabbed the flour and tossed it around the kitchen. Every time my wife makes a rice dish, I cringe at the cleanup I am going to have to do after. I had a Black and Decker ""plain jane"" rice cooker that worked perfectly for 20 years and there was no mess at all. This thing sits on your counter and tries to figure out ways to get even messier. This is the gift you give to people you hate. Think about this for a moment. This thing is so bad that I sat down after years of torture to write a review about it. We've tried everything from lowering the water level to wrapping a towel over the top. We've tried reasoning with it. You can't reason with the evil. Seriously, what are you still reading this for, the correct answer is ""No I do not want to watch my kitchen be covered in rice-y filth"". If they had negative stars, I'd give this a negative 50."
3,cuisinart disapppointment,"I finally got used to my Cuisinart rice cooker and its quirks and was fairly satisfied with the results. After using the cooker only once a week for nine months, the switch broke and the machine would not work."
5,The best Rice cooker ever!!!!!!,"I purchased this in 2008 and am now writing reviews for my amazon purchases .. This must be the first product that i ever bought on Amazon and has outlasted anything else. I am still using this little thing today for steaming and cooking my vegetables, seafood, and rice. I love it..."
3,broke after 4 months,"This little cutie is the cutest rice cooker i have seen, but sadly it lasted the shortest. i could cook white rice and wild rice (purple korean rice) in it just fine, but one day it stopped cooking rice and started staying on ""keep warm"" mode at all times. *sadness*"
2,over flow,I would not recommend this rice cooker. No matter how much rice I cook; 1 cup+ the rice water boils over. I have to put a pan under it to catch the sticky rice water. This occurs regardless if I wash the rice or don't wash the rice.
5,Great!,"Just perfect for me and my wife!! I didn't need a cooker and this model has the perfect size! Easy to use, doesn't heat too much on the exterior.Recommended!"
4,good product,Product works very well for cooking rice and steaming vegetables. I've found that when I cook brown rice I have to add more water than the instructions say. I've had this for about a year and it's held up fine. It's nice that the cooker stops automatically and then warms your rice. I've never been able to cook good rice but now I can! The capacity is small so it's perfect for my husband and I. You can cook just the right amount of rice and steamed vegetables for two people with a little bit of leftovers. If you have a larger family then you'll probably want a larger capacity cooker.
3,"Buy something else, but not this","I bought this because I thought the smaller size would be great for me and my husband. It doesn't matter what recipe you follow, plan extra time to clean up the mess when it boils over (it does this every time). It makes great rice, but the boiling over and ensuing mess isn't worth it. I'm planning to buy another brand. Do yourself a favor and do the same."
2,It makes tasty rice! It makes a sloppy mess.,"I love the look of this rice maker, but it's stupidly messy. I always place this rice cooker in the middle of my glass-top stove when I use it because I know it'll require a clean up. Honest;y, I should start putting it in the sink when I make rice. Or, better yet, I should put it in the trash and buy a rice cooker that functions properly.Come on, Cuisinart! Don't you use your own products? I can't imagine how this thing made it through testing without someone noticing the mess it makes.I only gave this rice cooker two stars because it's attractive. Then again, my ex-girlfriend is attractive, but there's a very good reason she's an ex! This rice cooker should become my ex too. Seriously, the second star is pure charity. Unless your highest priority is how a rice cooker will look on your counter, don't buy this one. Not even on sale (I got it for $30)."
2,Rice cooker broke in less than 6 months,"I purchased this rice cooker because it looked really good and it's a Cuisinart. However, this is a great disappointment. It does overflow when cooking rice unless you put the steamer basket. And the worst thing is, in less than 6 months of daily use, it broke. My previous rice cookers in the $20 price range fared so much better. They lasted 1-2 years."
1,Avoid Cuisinart - defective products,"We bought a Cuisinart CJK-17BC Cordless Kettle, CPT-160BCH Toaster and a CRC-800 Rice Cooker. The Kettle had to be replaced three times, toaster twice and rice cooker once within 1.5 years. We just gave up on Cuisinart, not worth the time, effort and money spent on postage sending items back and waiting weeks without a replacement."
1,Under cooked in the Mountains,"I received this as a gift. Heard how everyone loves their rice cookers. I have a different problem than the other reviewers. The rice cooker turned off after 30 min and all the water was absorbed/evaporated and my rice was still crunchy. I added more water and turned it back on, then repeated this process three more times for a total of 2 1/2 x's the fluid and 2.25 hours to cook. I ended up with rice mash, but it was edible at least. I am guessing this is due to my high altitude location- 5800 feet. I've known others here who love their rice cookers, so I don't know if it is the cooker or the altitude. There are no special instructions in the instruction book or in the cook book on high altidude adjustments. Still experimenting..."
3,"Looks Great, but Makes a Mess!","Being a daily 'rice maker' I wanted a rice cooker I could keep on the counter top. While it looks sharp on the counter, this rice cooker boils over when cooking- even if only making one cup. I have discovered the problem is with the lid which allows boil over. I simply used my old rice cooker lid and problem solved! For aesthetics, I switched the top knob so that it matched. Also the existing lid is difficult to clean as it has a small lip underneath that can only be cleaned out with a toothpick... Rice cookers are simple devices, just boiling water for x amount of minutes... So overall looks great, works fine, but needs a different lid!"
1,bad rice cooker,This rice cooker overflows and does not cook the rice all the way. Threw itaway after a few months.
1,A Big Mess,"I purchase this rice cooker because of the size. It seemed like the perfect purchase for a family of two. I have used this cooker three times and each time a huge mess is left behind after the rice has cooked. The starch from the rice escapes through the lid and leaves white, flakey, starchy foam all over the lid, cooker and my counter top. It is a big mess to clean up and not appreciated. I gave a rating of one but preferred to enter a zero."
1,Spills over water and creates a mess!,I've had this cooker for 2 years now and every single time I make rice it spills over water all over the unit as well as some on my ocunter. It's such a mess! I just read the reviews here and people mentioned that using the steaming tray instead of the glass lid solves that problem. So I'm going to try that; but what doesn't work out of the box as instructed in the manual is not a product worth buying. Especially when it costs $80!! I wish I'd got one of those $20 rice cookers and they would have served me much better! I bought this unit without looking into many reviews mainly because I trusted cuisinart; but no longer!
1,Awful Rice Cooker,"As other reviewers have said, this rice cooker is awful! When I cook brown rice, it burns the bottom of the rice no matter if I cook a lot of rice or just a little bit. When I cook white rice, it boils over and makes a mess on the counter.The steamer that comes with it is a horrible design. there is a crack at the bottom and if food gets in there, it is a pain to clean out. Also, it is designed to sit perfectly on top of the rice cooking pot, but it is sometimes hard to get it to the right position and you risk the steamer bin falling off the rice cooker.Also, how expensive is an on/off switch? Why they didn't include one is beyond me. Why do I always have to unplug the thing to turn it off? I hate having the plug lying around the counter when I am not using it.As others have said, the only good thing about this rice cooker is that it looks nice. Avoid this rice cooker. There are plenty of better options."
1,Worst Rice Cooker Ever!,This rice cooker is very messy ... the water boils over and makes a big mess. I will be buying another rice cooker but definitely not a Cusinart!
1,Not Worth the Money,"You can get a much better rice cooker for half the money. This made bad rice every seven times I used it. I tried less water, making smaller batches, stopping the cooking process before it was officially finished, and the rice (usually brown rice) was starchy and sticky every time. The thing makes a huge mess - it needs a lower setting - it boils way to hard for way too long."
1,Pretty to look at but makes a HUGE MESS!,"Pros:- Sleek and sexy to look at- Gets the job done- The steamer is a bonus. It's great for prepping veggies to be stir fried.Cons:- Water always boils over and creates a HUGE mess!- Rice almost always browns at the bottom- Due to the boiling over problem, you have to clean not only the rice bowl and lid, but the entire appliance, after each and every use!"
3,"Good,,, no retractable cord though","Like the cooker, makes great oatmeal.Disappointed with the retractable cord, it doesn't exist"
3,Help Please! - Won't switch from Warm to Cook!,"I've been reading all the reviews and I'm not sure if anyone else has had the problem I have. I've read the operating directions but can't figure out how to turn the cooker on! It's plugged in and the WARM light automatically comes on. But every time I press the button to switch to COOK, the button pops back up and it turns back to WARM. It will not stay in the COOK position!Please help if you have any idea what's going on with this rice cooker!"
1,bolis over,"I was excited about this rice maker, right size, looks good, good brand.. BUT the darn thing boiled over every time I used it..The reason I got it is because I got tired of watching the rice in a saucepan.. Clean up is messy and just not worth it.. AND I tried all the suggestions on the site so this wouldn't happen.. I returned it.A friend gave me an old Japanese rice maker and it works perfectly.."
1,Big Mess!,"We have had this rice cooker for about a year and while it still ""works"" I am looking to buy a new one. I can't stand the 15 minutes it takes to scrub the outside of the unit and the surface it is sitting on every time I use it. Starchy water always spurts out through the vent in the lid and the sides of the lid. Doesn't matter if I rinse the rice, use oil or use slightly less water. The only thing I like is that the bowl and the lid are easy to clean."
1,Junk,Didn't even last a year. Started cooking inconsistent after 2 months and the switch/sensor broke after less than a year. Tried to fix it but could not as it's cheaply built chinese junk.
5,It's Cuisinart. What more need I say?,The rice cooker is exactly what you would expect from Cuisinart...perfect...everytime. Would definitely recommend to all rice lovers...especially for cooking difficult brown rice.
4,Cuisinart 4-Cup Rice Cooker,"Bought as a gift and the receipient like the product, however felt the""4-cup"" is deceiving. Nevertheless, it goes very well with their new kitchen and it is good enough to cook rice for two people."
1,Not Reliable,"I received this rice cooker as a gift in February 2010, and use it regularly. 13 Months after I received the cooker, the timer system has gone out. The ""hot"" setting no longer goes off, burning anything I've cooked in it for the past couple of weeks. For the cost of the unit, it should last longer. I would NOT buy another Cuisinart."
1,what a mess,"I really wanted to like this as it's small and a good brand but what a mess it makes! EVERYTHING boils over. If you reduce the measurements, it burns. It works well as a steamer for a small amount of food, but that's not why I bought it. Will look for a better model."
1,Absolutely Horrible!,"Unless you intend to clean sludge (and lots of it) evey time you use this cooker, don't buy it! My family is from Hawaii, we eat rice all the time, and this is the worst cooker I have ever seen! I really don't think the R & D people at Cuisinart actually even tried to see how their machine cooks rice before putting it on the market. I think they just needed a rice cooker that complemented the rest of their product line. This thing REALLY makes a mess even if you are only cooking two cups of rice. Don't buy it!"
4,Rice Cooker,"I like the appearance of the product; the retractable cord is an added bonus. My only complaint is that after following all the directions, everytime I cook rice liquid steams out of the top and runs everywhere."
2,so disappointing,"i am so disappointed with this unit. i follow a pretty strict macrobiotic diet and cook rice and other whole grains on an almost-daily basis. thought a rice cooker might be convenient, wouldn't have to watch the stove as much... boy, was i wrong. for several days now i have been following the instructions to the letter, and the thing bubbles over, scorches, and undercooks, particularly with brown rice. i didn't purchase mine from amazon, so it's going back to the store tomorrow."
3,"Cooks rice great, but boils over a little.","If this rice cooker did not boil over a bit I would have given it 5 stars. Nice looking and compact. I did follow other reviewers comments, but still have a bit of overflow:("
2,Such a let down,"We were very excited when we opened the box, and when we started using it the first time. After that, the surprises began. First, the rice baked on to the bottom. Even after soaking overnight it took a half hour of fingernails to clean it. Worse still, the next time we tried to use it (a week later) the cooker didn't work at all. This was a refurbished unit apparently, but I personally expect better than one use for a refurbished unit. When facing the choice to return or exchange, my wife and I unanimously decided to return it.BIG NOTES: Not purchased through Amazon, refurbished, non stick didn't work, stopped working after first use, bad experience with the product."
3,Not worth $50,"Is this a bad product, no. It does exactly what it say it will do. However less expensive rice cookers and steamers that do exactly the same thing are available. It boils the rice and steams what ever food is in the steamer pot above. The stemer pot is light weight and somewhat flimsy. I was attempting to check the food that was steaming and the slightest touch knocks the steamer pot off balance.Another reviewer stated it cooks sticky rice wonderfully, but I did not find that to be the case, so it may be I don't know how to cook the rice except in an actual steamer. It has a warmer to keep the food warm until iam ready for it. I can also cook other foods that require boiling in it.It also much nicer looking then my current cooker and has taken its place on the appliance shelf. Although, I'm going to keep old faithful."
2,Not a rice cooker,"Pros:It looks nice and sleek on your counter. That's it!Cons:It can cook rice, but boils over and you'll have a messy countertop and floor. I cook rice all the time with or without a rice cooker. This little thing is just awful. I tested it with a cup of rice, but the water boiled over on my counter and the floors. I even tried leaving the lid open, but the water just kept on boiling over. I've never seen rice cookers do that!I haven't tried this as a steamer, but if the steamer works well then I think Cuisinart should rename this ""Steamer"" NOT a rice cooker!**please see pictures**"
1,Lousy rice cooker,"This machine does a lousy job cooking rice. I used cheapo $20.00 rice cooker for 10 years (before it died)and it cooked perfect rice. Coconut rice, rice with broth, with vegies in it etc..., no problem. The Cuisinart stopped cooking before all the liquid was gone. It also boils like crazy. I think the issue is that the insert is tall and narrow. Generally in most rice cookers the insert is wider than it is tall. This is a poorly designed machine and definitely not worth the price tag."
2,Terrible,"Cusinart appliances are generally great, and my kitchen has several. When I saw this one, I bought it due to the Cuisinart name. I wanted a top-of-the-line rice cooker. I am returning it today after three months of use. It cooks great rice, but the clean-up is ridiculous. The lid just rests on the top, and it doesn't stop spewing steam and rice goo all down the side of the machine, as well as the kitchen counter. It's got to the point where we cook something other than rice because we canot stand the clean-up. I get this same result whether I cook one cup, or six. I've tried difference rices. Always the same. So, it's going back today and I will get a rice cooker that has a clamp-shut lid like my old Zojirushi, which gave me ten years ol great service."
1,disapointing for Cuisinart,"I use this rice cooker mostly for brown rice and it is a fiasco. You need to put in 1/2 the water that you are supposed to, wait until that is cooked in and then add the other half. Adding all the water up front causes the cooker to boil over - a real mess with rice. It looks OK, but it just isn't the quality item you would expect with the name Cuisinart. The price is also reasonable, so its not the end of the world - it might be better for things that don't require as much water or cook time (like white rice)."
1,Worthless!,This is the worse purchase you could make. You will end up with a boiled over mess all over your counter top and a crusty shell of rice on the inside to peel off the sides! Hate it!!!
1,do not buy this product,I received this rice cooker/steamer for Christmas and am very disappointed. While it cooks rice well it boils over and makes a mess of you counter top.
4,Good Rice Cooker for Daily Use,"My husband and I got this rice cooker for our wedding in June, and have used it almost daily since we received it. We are very happy with this rice cooker. Our biggest complaint is that the water boils over when we cook brown rice; we now put several paper towels under the rice cooker, which saves a little time with the mess. It is fine with other types of rice. Sometimes the bottom of the rice will be a little overcooked. The ""warm"" feature does not seem to work so well. Still, the rice cooker gets the job done and has so far stood up to daily use."
2,save your money until you can buy something better,"I made the mistake of buying this rice cooker about 2 years ago. I looked at other brands but wanted to save money and try this one. Two years later, I wish I had never done it and put the money towards something much better. I am about to give it to Goodwill. It does still work - BUT - it overflows about half of the time (and I do put oil in as other reviews suggested, which does help some). The non-stick coating is really poor and basically is not very non-stick. So now I am back on amazon looking at getting a new rice cooker. I would rather spend more initially at this point, and get something that will last for many years. This does work and does cook rice reasonably, so if you're looking for a bargain I think there are some around on this model."
3,Not Technical Enough To Draw My Praise,"If an album is a good technical album, like any progressive rock album should be, you should be able to listen to is far more times than this one. The song that says, ""Photographs and fallen leaves,"" I have to admit was very catchy to me at first. However, like the rest of the songs on this album, they are only worth a moderate amount of listens and then you might as well dispose of the album. True, I was captivated at first, but unlike some other prog rock bands like Rush, Queensryche, and Savatage, I did not get much more than a fizzle of solid enjoyment from this album."
4,"Moving in the right direction, New and Improved","This is the best SB in a long time, and would have been even better if they had left track 3 out. Track 3 is a blatent attempt at ""radio friendly"" music, guess I can't blame them for wanting to sell more CD's. Overall my favorite SB album, by a long shot, is ""V"". But if the band keeps moving in their current direction I would expect great things in the future. It is not the old band, but they could end up being a Better Band!"
4,I got over their name and so can you!,"I'm not sure if there is a category for Spock's Beard and their unique brand of music, but there are other great bands who share their quest for musical perfection. Folks like Gentle Giant, Porcupine Tree, Yes, Jethro Tull and others come to mind as I sit here and let the beautiful melodies wash over me. To think these same instruments make the music found on the radio today is a bit confusing. Anyway, this latest album is great and I must admit I am not a fan of song 3 but I do not hold it againgst the boys for trying to make a buck. I'd put this up there with The Kindness of Strangers and just short of V as my scoring goes. If you like Spock's Beard, buy this disc. If you are new to this band, this is a fine place to start. I got over their name and so can you!"
3,Improving,"Spock's Beard continues to improve following the loss of Neal Morse, but still aren't quite there. None of their three albums without Neal can compare to anything done with Neal, but this one is probably the best of those three.Not their best, not their worst, but the band is getting better, gaining more confidence and improving their songwriting skills."
2,Stay Away as long as......,"They continue to call this Spock's Beard. What a Joke.I am a HUGE fan of the Beard. This is not The Beard. The Beard died when SM found Jesus and decided that because of that he needed to take a great band and turn it to ash.These are great musicians. This is a good album. But it is not, and will never be Spock's Beard. Not even Close.Buy this cause you like Nick, Ryo and the guys. But don't pretend and compare it to V or KOS or even the disjointed Snow. It's insulting to the greatness that was, and shows that you have no appreciation for the greatness that was the Beard..RIP - Spock's Beard."
4,Georgie and Caspar are soulmates,"A friendly little ghost named Georgie must look for a new place to live when the gentleman of the house decides to nail down the stair Georgie creaks each night and oil the hinges on the door he squeeks each night. Can ghosts file for unemployment? This endearing story celebrates our interdependence -- it's only when Georgie makes his ghost sounds that Mr. and Mrs. Whittaker know it's bedtime, Miss Oliver the owl knows it's time to wake and Herman the cat knows it's time to prowl. The action moves along at a lively pace and the charming black and white drawings are full of amusing details. Children will be reassured by the fact that even those things rumored to be very scary can turn out to be as friendly as this little ghost."
5,My favorite childhood book,"I loved this book as a child in the 70's, and now I read it to my son and daughter. It is a timeless story, which brings back great memories for me."
4,Rap and HipHop From my College Dayz,"Man. I love this album. I just was able to find both the cassette and a CD version of it. It was one of those albums along with Cypress Hill, Total Devastation, Digable Planets Blowout Comb, Gravediggaz, and GZA and Killah Priest, that seemed to define my existence at college for a few years!There are no reviews of this album and its really very hard to find any mention of this group and UGLY. Though you will find Ugly on Myspace listing up the groups he's working with. Anyhow. Here's a cheer to remembering good ole stuff"
2,Biggest disappointment of 2005,"After hearing ""Hidden Hands of a Sadist Nation"", I was hooked to the thrash and catchy riffs that Darkest Hour brought, so I was looking forward to this one for a while. 2 years later, ""Undoing Ruin"" is released, and the verdict is, I was highly disappointed.There is really not one single good song on this album, maybe the opener that I don't even bother looking for the title for. But the biggest shame are the length of the songs, 4 minutes seemed to be cut off comparing to ""Hidden Hands...."" and that didn't ride to well.If you want to hear the best of Darkest Hour, buy ""Hidden Hands"" you won't regret it."
5,franky is the most ridiculous person ever,"thats about all i have to say. to even compare korn or trapped to this is a disgrace to darkest hour, and metal in general. this album will blow you away with how far theyve come. best metal album of the year no doubt."
5,#1 album of the year,WOW...this CD is absolutely amazing. I'm glad that it's getting such high reviews because they really deserve it. I think everyone should go out and buy Undoing Ruin just to see for themselves how awesome it actually is. I never had to skip a single track!
1,Sissy gothencore,"Dont get this confused with good melodeath. You'll never find good melodeath from America, EVER (except Arsis). It always ends up sounding too much like Killswitch Engage. And that holds true to this.ZOMG THIS AWESUM STUFF D00D!!!11 The guy said in the record store. But, I already knew who these guys were. So I got to sample the clerks copy. Man, was this stuff generic. And I know, melodeath isnt exactly the most groundbreaking stuff, but play 20 diffrent songs from 20 diffrent good melodeath bands and I could tell you who they were. I had to ask the clerk ten times to make sure I wasnt listening to Unearth, Killswitch Engage, All that Remains, or the Black Dahlia. And to be frank, who cares.This is audio feces."
2,Please enter a title for your review,"While I'm not much of a fan of this band, and never was, I have to say this album is surprisingly conventional and commercial sounding. These guys haven't developed any pop songwriting skills, they've just watered down their sound for the masses. The tempos and melodies of these songs are ridigly conventional and dull. If you want to hear Darkest Hour when they were more brutal and creative, when they had a somewhat fresh approach to mixing thrash, death and hardcore, when they had more of a musical identity, check out So Sedated So Secure. I wasn't much into that album when it came out, mainly because it wasn't very melodic, but I could at least tell they had some balls and creativity. On Undoing Ruin they've polished their sound to a high sheen, but lost everything that gave them vitality in the process."
2,Poor quality photos indoors,"I have owned this camera for a year now and I am not able to get good quality photos indoors. Most of my indoor photos have turned out dark. I have missed a lot of great photos (concerts, award ceremony, pageants, etc.) because of this camera."
2,Not so great.,"I bought this camera because it was a good price for a 5 megapixel digital camera plus Konica Minolta is a good name in cameras. The viewing screen is small but worst of all its got a lot of noise in it; it's virtually impossible to see if your shot is clean and in focus. The camera doesn't have an image stabilizer so the slightest movement and you've got a blurry shot. It's bulky and odd looking and doesn't travel well.It's one year later and I'm going to buy a Sony DSCW50 because it's smaller, lighter, thinner, has an image stabilizer, is user friendly and with a longer battery life."
4,Overall a good buy,The only problem I had this figure was getting the tools of torture to fit in his hand.
2,Less than it was!,"I just picked up a couple of the new (April 2010) packages. Same barcode, but they've decreased the size by a full 10%. Wafers contain 10% less everything, including fiber. Oh well."
3,Interesting,"This is my first encounter with dissident China. Like other dissident work written under communism, Red Dust is just as explicitly dark and unaffected. Through his own personal experience, Ma Jian introduces the reader to the oppression and creative limitations Chinese artists endure. Not surprisingly, this very limitation and control of their every day life results in originality and inspiration. Ma Jian's journey is the exact example of this trajectory. This is an interesting book as an introduction to the Chinese internal expressions of discontent in the 1980s. Impressive English translation!"
4,Another great album by Bruce. But...,"You can't go wrong. This is another great solo album by Bruce Dickinson and, once again, it is much, I mean MUCH, better than recent Iron Maiden releases.So, why did I give four stars? It's because you will not feel shocked the way you felt when your first heard ACCIDENT OF BIRTH and THE CHEMICAL WEDDING. Maybe it's because Adrian Smith is not on board, maybe because (as someone below said) the album sounds a little too much ""studio"", mainly the drums. Also, the Roy Z sound signature is all over the place, which is starting to sound a little bit formulatic. You listen to the Dickinson albuns, the new by Judas Priest and the Halford solo albuns and you think it's the same band!"
5,Buy it now!!!!!!!!!,"I am a huge maiden fan and i recently got into Bruce's solo stuff. I have found that each of his solo albums are good, but only have 3-4 excellent songs per album, but bear in mind they are still good. When i listened to Tyranny of Souls i found that it was worthy of the works that maiden are now doing. Abduction, Soul Intruders, Kill Devil Hill, Navigate the Seas of the Sun, Power of the Sun, Devil on a Hog and A Tyranny of Souls are all perfect making the album one of the best CDs that i have, not just the best Bruce Dickinson works. My friends and i always say have it sucks that the new metal music is good and powerful, but the singing sucks, Dickinson has changed that. BUY IT!!!!!!!"
4,Simply Great!,"As others have said, ""Tyranny of Souls"" falls short of ""Accident of Birth"" or ""Chemical Wedding."" I feel this is primarily because of Adrian Smith absence. Overall the album is simpler and more of a straight ahead rocker, compared to AoB and CW. Musically it lies somewhere between AoB and Bruce's earlier work, ""Ball to Picasso."" The album starts out fairly heavy and then becomes more varied and emotive towards the end. Bruce's singing is magnificent though, sounding much better than the last two Maiden albums and I enjoyed every song. The high points on the album are ""Kill Devil Hills"" and ""Tyranny of Souls."" Highly recommended."
2,Worst of the 3,"Definitely the worst of the 3, Accident of Birth being #1, Chemical Wedding #2. Not much to speak real fondly of on this one. Buy another Maiden instead!"
4,Needs Some Adrian Smith,About as good an album as Bruce and Roy Z could put out without the melodic counter solos that Adrian Smith added on Accident & Chemical. This still kicks ass though-- mean & nasty yet with some great writing/production.PS(I would love to hear Dio sing Believil too)Keep rocking Bruce
4,Another very good album,Bruce Dickinson have great solo career . Especially his last two albums were excellent. For another one time he proves that great music on the scene of metal still lives. This is a very good album and it sounds more closely to Chemical wedding.All the songs are great and the album can be listened once with great feelings toward hearing it. A must for metal fans.
5,As good as what he has done with Iron Maiden,"While not in the league with a Piece of Mind, this recording is just as heavy, but not as progressive as other Maiden recordings, like Number of the Beast.Think a bit more simplified with all the quality songwriting, performance and production."
1,"Buy it for the photos, not for the content.","All of Kelsey-Woods' books have terrific photos, but poorly organized and often inaccurate information. Sections on hedgehog diet recommend foods that are high in fat, low in protein -- exactly the opposite of what a hedgehog needs. He also recommends the use of gloves while handling hedgehogs -- a true no-no if you ever expect your pet to bond with you. The habitats shown in the book are not large enough for an active hedgehog.This book is widely distributed, and I am sad every time I see it displayed in a bookstore. Hedgehogs all over the country are receiving sub-standard care because of this book."
5,The Best of Many Artist Videos,"Being a visual person and a compulsive art maker, DVDs and Videos of artists working (as well as the paths of experience and experimentation that educated the work)are my very favorite way of collecting knowledge and inspiration. This is the best of the current artist profiles I have ever seen. The personality of the artist really seems to have instructed the atmosphere and pace of the film. The scenes of he and his assistant transfering his vegie dye photo enlargements made my mouth water with tint and image. BRAVO"
3,A combination chronology and encyclopedia,"This book is a creditable but modest effort covering the Korean War. It starts out with an introduction of the history of the two Koreas and its people. It moves on to a modest 16 page chronology. The rest of the book is the encyclopedia of names, places, organizations, key battles and weapons used. The explanations vary in length from a paragraph to a page or a little longer. There are a few simple but effective maps and some photos.This book would be ideal for a beginner or someone with just a cursory interest in the war. For a more complete chronology see Bud Hannings's book. For a comprehensive coverage of the war see Clay Blair or Roy Appleman."
1,"Is awfull, don't buy it.","This guys try to sell piece of garbage trying to look like a ""hakko"" equipment but the real name of this item is ""quakko"" and cheap imitation. If you buy this, you'll use it for a month (with some luck) before it fail."
1,"more expensive than the real thing - and it quacks, too!","blatant ripoff of the well known hakko brand name.who cares if this unit works or not. its a ripoff and shouldn't even BE on amazon, to be serious.there are other hakko clones out there; if you must buy a fake, at least get one that won't cause bursts of laughter from your lab team ;)(btw, it probably does not actually make a quacking noise. otoh, ymmv. void where prohibited, do not eat, yadda yadda yadda)"
1,SUPER SMALL,"I ordered this book for my daughter and paid almost $15 dollars for it and when I received it, it was super tiny! It was doll sized! I returned it right away."
3,THESE ARE NOT THE SOCKS YOU SEE IN THE PICTURE,"I gave this product 3 stars for a very specific reason. The Elegant Baby socks are WONDERFUL ~ so chic and great quality. However, the socks shown here are NOT the socks you get. I got a set of bright orange, bright green, and bright yellow ~ not the cute shoe looking design I expected for my little girl. Soooo . . . 3 stars . . . 5 for the quality, 1 for the description which is totally deceiving!"
5,Amazing Power,"right from the start this music captured my heart and my spirit.not just profound and authentic Chanting, but kick arse beats and melodies. Bliss full moments on Migmetsa.This is some thing new, never heard d&b textures used with this kind of tibetan deep chant.Exotic eastern drums with high tek on the floor bass, cool as...i want Lotus beat two!"
5,Fantastic product,"I purchased this product for my husband as a Christmas gift and it has ended up being a gift that has kept on giving. The color is truly amazing and the tuner within the t.v for us is the real prize. This t.v is in our bedroom where we do not have the HDTV tuner, but that has not been a problem for this t.v as it has the capability to access digital tuners and show stations that are broadcasting in HDTV. The color and picture is so beautiful that I am making plans to go to Greece just from watching Greek Landscapes from this t.v. Bravo Samsung."
2,Noisy,"Mine was mfd April 2007. Beautiful design, but noticeable high pitched noise. Changed ""backlight"" down from 10, and it quieted the noise. At 7, I could not hear it. It's a shame."
4,Great Set!,"I love this set. The picture is super clear and the setup was a breeze. I'm receiving the digital signal via a Terk antennae and get a perfect picture as long as the winds aren't blowing too much. That's when I throw on a dvd. ;-)One cool thing to do with this set is connect my laptop via the pc connection and watch Netflix on demand movies or any of the networks streaming content. Also, the iTunes movies and tv shows play and look really good on this set. Now, if I only had an hdmi output on the laptop, I'd be set.My only drawback is the way it programs favorite channels. I think it's a bit tedious and could be done via a button on the remote with one click.Super stylish, great picture, fair sound, easy purchase."
5,"Best 26"" out there","i got this tv after having last years 23"" since Christmas, and was looking for something a little bigger and better. this TV is it, with all the feature's of the high end samsungs, this tv is perfect for its size. my 360 looks great and so do all thing HD. 8 ms response time is good too."
1,will not work with a DVI PC connection,"I was looking for a HD TV monitor that I could hook up with my new home built PC- [which has a Nvidia 8800 GTS card that has DVI connections]. This TV will not work with a PC with DVI. Only the 2007 Samsungs will.The FAQ at the Samsung website says:If you have a 2007 Samsung LN-T LCD TV and it has more than one HDMI jack, you can use the HDMI 1 input jack to connect to your computer's DVI video output jack using a DVI to HDMI cable.No Samsung LCD TV built before 2007 (LN-S series, LN-R series, LT-P series, etc.) has a DVI input for a computer. All models built before 2007, however, have an analog, 15 pin D-Sub (RGB) computer input.Important: Many of Samsung models built before 2007 have a combined HDMI/DVI input jack. You cannot use this combined HDMI/DVI jack to connect your pre-2007 Samsung TV to your computer's DVI video output jack. Samsung TVs built before 2007 do not support DVI to HDMI computer video connections.HTH"
1,"Samsung 26"" LCD TV","TV is probably a very good product but I was working with a height limit. I had a max. Height of 19.25"" to work with. Amazon advertises as 18.1"" height I think. Contacted Samsung and was told it was 19.1"" with stand. I ordered it on Tuesday night and received it Thurs. noon with no shipping charge. After I put together and tried to put it in the cabinet I found out it wouldn't fit. It was actually 19.75"" high with stand. Returned and waiting for credit. Purchased 23"" Samsung and it is a great TV"
1,"Good 18"" tv til you turn it on.","All I can say is this is one incredibly great looking tv. Until you turn it on. Awful reception (on cable). Even tho it advertises a wall mount with it... no such thing. Unless it's very well hidden. Unless they meant the instructions for a wall mount. Got those.So outside of no wall mount and very snowy reception, it's great. Um... huh? I gave it the one star because it looks good when it's turned off.I guess I should point out that I pretty much detest the wide screen format anyway. I rarely watch dvd's so staring at tv shows with the people all stretched out and distorted doesn't really work for me. Yes, you can adjust it for standard screen, but then you've just paid a fortune for, in this case, a 26"" tv and you get to watch a 18"" tv. Wheeee! Nope, not for me."
4,Love my new flatscreen,"I did a lot of research including Consumer Reports. Decided on the Samsung because of the good ratings, picture, size/weight, and price. Also, I had previously purchased a much larger Samsung and was happy with it.Buying this one from Amazon was terrific. Ordered it on the weekend; it arrived by Wednesday. And the price was great.The TV has lived up to my expectations, and the service from Amazon exceeded my expectations. This was the first time I had ever purchased anything other than books from Amazon. Now I'm hooked. The next week I purchased a carpet cleaner."
3,Doesn't Last,"I loved this television when I got it in Feb 2008 and enjoyed using it until it would not turn on at all, no power. TV was only 17 months old. Of course the warranty expired after 12 months and Samsung thinks nothing of having one authorized repair shop 100 miles away and charges $80.00 to just look at it. I guess Samsung makes products that don't last. Even though the warranty expired they could offer an authorized repair facility closer that wouldn't charge just to look at it. I thought LCD tv's were supposed to last for awhile guess not this one from SAMSUNG."
1,Lasted 6 months -- now it has to go.,"What an awful TV. I bought mine during the fall of 08, now the screen has huge dark ""smudges"" probably due to the backlight tube dying.Short warranty (90 days) so there is no fixing it.I will just discard it soon and buy something else, just proves you can't buy cheap and really save any money."
5,Excellent !!!!,"I also did a lot of resaerch prior to purchasing this new Samsung 26"" LCD. The best picture quality in its class. Only a few other even came close. The price was the deciding factor. Great value !!!!!"
5,Best Bang for your Buck,"I researched every single lcd tv in this price range (under $800) and ended up buying two other tv's before this one. Although for this price you can get a pretty hefty size tv in an olevia, westinghouse or vizio you can definitely tell the difference (trust me, I've had all of them). I've had this tv for about a month now and have had no problems whatsoever and that hissing noise that everyone refers to is NOT a big deal at all. Havent heard it once"
5,Privacy Screen,Screen Works great. Actually blacks out wiew if not looking directly at tthe PC. It did need some minor adjustment to fit my screen which had to improvise.
3,disc three,i had a problem with this disc. around 57 min. til about 1:02 min disc was unviewable. had to jump forward then backup to view what i did see but couldn't view enjoyably if at all during these times. P.s. my disc was new staight out of the unopened box ( I thought).
3,Its ok,"I really like the show dragon ball and Dragon ball Z. Season 2 is great for the collection. but personly, I just don't care for it too much. I enjoy good action, but Red army in this season not what I was looking for. Maybe its Vol 3. was what I looking for."
4,Brilliant series but is let down by the remastering,"The presentation of the Dragonball Z series is brilliant. It is well worth the money and I would suggest it to any DBZ fan.The remastering quality is good, just the cutting of the frames that really irritates me. Having been moved aspect ratios, the top and bottom have both been cut off leaving you with a lesser image. It would have been nice to have the opening scene like I remember it to, I'm not a big fan of the japanese version, and what the heck is the ending scene all about?!Other than that, the marathon feature is a brilliant idea if you plan watching a DVD in full. The casing and DVDs themselves look professional and good enough to sit on your DVD shelf."
4,Pretty Good,"This a good, but not great season. It tends to drag on a little and it's got a good amount of filler that is just plain unessential. However, the main episodes are fantastic and make up for it's shortcomings. It's worth the buy."
5,absolutely wonderful,"well this season is just great plenty of comedy mixed with the right amount of action,its just greatso i you love dragonball, dont hesitate get this for your collection."
1,Awful,"Crap. Doesn't work. Wanted to return it but had to go out of town and lost the time period. Plastic junk, never did get a good signal. The worst Sony item I've ever purchased -- and I'm a Sony fan. Will still attempt to return somehow. Don't even bother."
3,I'm returning mine,"I thought that this mic would be exactly what I was looking for. After plugging this in I get a consistent hiss noise in the background. The wireless portion still works and you can hear the voices over the hiss, but I really don't want to deal with cleaning up a background noise like that. Needless to say, I'm returning mine."
2,mediocre at best,Being a Sony fan and expecting the customary good quality items one would normally receive....this item is disappointing. It's just not very good sounding and has some issues with hiss and pop occasionally. If it were a different company other than Sony I would probably give it more stars.
4,Decent system for a mid end product.,"Just purchased this and like the small size and clip on and total portability. also like that you can monitor the sound coming into the camcorder. Sound quality is excellent when there is no competing sounds and is within 40 feet. Saw another product for 1/3 as much but required to be plugged in to work (the main system not the clip on which was on battery power). My biggest complaint is that it tends to fade at about 60 feet away. I was hoping for the signal to be a bit stronger till about 100 feet. It's not professional quality but selection at this price was slim. Recommend it? Yes, for a short range interview or public speaking use."
4,Happy,"Solid product-works just as stated. Lack of stereo could pose a problem for some, but was expected."
2,Radio interference is bad,I have tried to use these under optimal settings to see if maybe it was my camera causing the interference or something else but I always get static in my recordings even when they are close together.
5,Este libro se disfruta de principio a fin,"El libro comienza de una manera muy original, por el final. El lector percibe esta idea pero resulta intrigante la manera en que el autor sigue desarrollando la historia atravez de las paginas. Es un libro muy divertido y muestra la idiosincracia latinoamericana de una manera colorida"
4,bueno,"no es un libro magifico ni malo. Yo prefiero Cien Anos de Soledad (tambien de Garcia Marquez). Pero, yo recomendo este libro.It's not a great book, but not bad either. I prefered 100 Years of Solitude (also by Garia Marquez). But, I recommend this book."
3,good condition,"i have not read the book yet but it seems to be in good condition. the binding is intact and there is no writing in the margins or anything, which i appreciate."
4,This book is interesting!!!,This book talks about a woman that gets married but in her honey moon her husband notices that she is not a virgin so he takes her back to her parents. They try to ask her who was the guy who made her lost her virginity but she doesnt tell. They think that Santiago Nasar was the man so the girl's brothers try to kill him. The whole town knows about this but Santiago himself. The brothers are looking for him and when they finally do they run after him and kill him in front of his doorsteps.
2,Binding is Terrible for this version,"Don't be fooled by a cute cover and cheap price. The binding for this edition of the book is terrible. I have gone through three books (and I take good care) because all the pages have fallen out just from bending the book back and forth.I love Garcia Marquez and he is somebody you will want to read again. But this paperback edition won't allow it - the book will break first!!!Thanks.En otras palabras, este edicion del libro es de calidad terrible. Ya han roto tres copias del mismo libro en un mes de estudiarlo, que mucho que trato no romperlo.Escoga otra edicion si quiere comprar este novela fantastica."
2,Its not bad but it isn't great either.,When I first saw this game it reminded me of the classic commando acrade game. After buying it I realized how much it was like games such as Iraki Warirrors or Jackal. You aganist the world and the minute that you die you lose all your power-ups. If you lose all your lives you have to start again from the very first level. With some many games out there that have a save feature you would think that the producers would have added one. Or even a password feature. What is even worse is the enemies that you fce most often our not they out range you and can shoot faster then you this is a game that needs to go back and be tweaked some more. I would only recommend it to some one that has the willingness to spend a day trying to beat this
2,Not the better game choice...,"This game is quite fun but I found it quite frustrating, especially at the end. There are swarms of enemies coming of nowhere and one hit, you're toast. You only got three lives... and it can get pretty boring. After you'll beat it, you probably won't play it again..."
5,Great price on a quality vest.,"I bought this for my elderly father (he's always cold) and he really liked it. The vest is very lightweight and keeps a steady, lightly warm temperature all the time. Certainly worth the money."
1,doesn't work--company out of business,This vest did not heat up. We tried to contact the company--the phone is disconnected. Returned to Amazon and am hoping for a refund...
2,DOESNT HEAT IN FRONT,This vest heats in the back but not in the front....not hot enough fo any serious weather. i am returning immediately to amazon.
3,A good read for an author who is fast going out of print.,"In another five or ten years about the only books of Sanders left in print will be the McNally series. Lardo will probably be more remmebered for that than Sanders. Cult followers are probably the only ones who read the Delaney books these days. The Deadly Sins series is rather heavy reading and not for the light hearted. Read this one if you are in no hurry to go anywhere. This one is probably the best of the four novels staring Delaney. Read and enjoy, then go on to something else."
4,Breaking the Silence with Hope,"This book is a black jewel. It is extremely stark in it's poetic and third-person description of a young woman's experience with rape. Not holding any information back, Godwin offers not a narrative, but a disturbing lyrical journey that she has made while attempting a recovery from the crises...and that is what makes this book so precious. It is raw emotion, written in many voices, daring the reader to enter deep into a horrifying situation. One is immediatly struck by the candor with which Godwin offers herself up to scrutiny within the pages. I read it in one sitting. I recommend this book for anyone seeking solace, or desiring a hard look into the consequences and recovery from a violent moment."
4,Breaking the Silence,A very emotional and well-written journal of a young girl trying to come to terms with a violent rape at a tender age of seventeen. Godwin allows us to see behind the mask that she has hid behind for forty years and allows us to witness how the rape affects one both emotionally and physically. I recommend this book for anyone trying to understand the emotions and fears of acceptance after such a violent crime.
1,Uninsightful and amateurish,"I was not impressed with this book. The format of journal entries was a creative spin, but the content was trite and not revealing at all."
3,Definitely made for vehicles.,"I read through the product page several times and did not get clued in to the fact that this is for a vehicle (SUV, van, or truck). The one review did mention using it in theirs, but I wasn't sure if they might be adapting a regular runner. I now see that it is auto supply stores that are the other places you can get these runners. This is long and thin. It has those bumps on the bottom like most car mats. I needed something for my hall that would keep my dog from slipping. When I realized these weren't made for inside, I thought it might do anyway, but was wrong. They are too uncomfortable to walk on. I'm sure they would work well in a van or SUV, but I don't have one of those. My daughter does, so I will see if she can use them."
2,escape,"EscapeBrook was arrested and He swears He is innocent, but he was sentenced to 5 years then he decided to run. In his escape the police go after him. Brook passes through various places trying to flee from the police. He goes to the airport to catch a plane and leave the country but the police arrest him again and he is go back to prision.This book is for English students. I don't really like the book because its history is very childish, out reality in its events.Mark Foster and Phillip Burrows (the authors) have worked as a writer illustrator team since 1991. They were born three years and many miles apart, but thuy are very nearly twins.by Ericklys Pires."
2,No narrative--no interest,"I have read several biographies about Elizabeth Taylor and this one is not good at all. I rarely give bad reviews, but this book is just terrible. There isn't a narrative at all. The author simply strings ""facts"" together in a semi-chronological way. She breezes through the first marriages, and, other than a few quotes (can't find any attribution though) by Elizabeth, she doesn't attempt to validate anything said. Ugh. Just don't buy this book. It is a disappointment."
2,It read like Kelly was putting little snippets of paper together to make a page.,Dry and choppy. Not much that wasn't already known. Don't think this one was worth the money. Would have been nice to have had some pictures.
3,rec ommend product,"Condition exactly as written;got product on time and its been fun listening to the book on tape,expecially after attending the Eliz Taylore auction in NYC"
3,Facts in successive order,"I didn't see this book so much as a biography as much as a lot of factoids strung together to make a full length book. I suppose if you are very interested in this famous starlet or if you were doing a research paper on her, this might be a good place to start. For me, it was rather boring. There is no conversational style to this book that pulls the reader in. I didn't love it, but others might, I suppose it depends on what you are looking for."
2,WELL WORTH THE PRICE...,"After reading Kitty Kelley's Nancy & then her Jackie, I expected more than I got in the story of Liz. I her take on this overblown so-called movie star just goes to show that after the likes of Davis, Hepburn, Loy, Colbert, Hollywood lost the ability to find real talent to create a true star and fell back on just packaging. Taylor truly epitomizes the latter."
2,Not the best but......,"after all, this book was written over 30 years ago, still the pages were yellowed, the cover was cracked and the subject matter turned out to be less than interesting. But for 99 cents who cares!"
3,"anti-glare screen works fine, but ...","the anti-glare screen seems to work OK, but the dimensions aren't right for my HP monitor w1907, the width is Ok, but it about 3 inches too long, it hangs down and rests on the monitor base, just making it. Is it one size fits all ?. Was it designed that way ? I also put some tape to secure the screen to the monitor, it hangs by two little tabs, not secure at all, I don't want to have to buy a new one just in case I bump it and it lands on the ground. Lastly, it would be nice if it came in black, the off-white doesn't match the sleek look of my HP monitor."
4,Works well on smaller screens.,This filter does a very good job on my Mac. I did have to order extra clips when two of the original broke off.
2,It didn't fit the screen,"I order products for the entire staff. There are 7 offices in our organization. Our IT person found this product and thought it would fit a 19"" screen. It did not and the product has been returned. As far as quality is concerned, we couldn't test it because of the bad fit."
5,One of Sheen's very best performances!,"Everything about this film feels authentic. Police work is not glory and macho theatrics here. It's daily drudge and trudge and the toll it takes on a hard-working officer's personal life can be enormous. Sheen's character has a serious struggle with his religious faith also. The best part of this movie is when he finally locates David Berkowitz and leads the capture. Instead of getting tough, Det. Zigo and his fellow officers are all nervous and jumpy and don't want to make a mistake."
1,"keefycub is right, regretably",ah Braxton... too clever for his own damn good. but luckily this is the only instance where this becomes painfully aparent. that I know of.
3,Some gems poorly set,"I own this cd and many of the cds from which these tracks are gleaned. As an introduction to several of Dorian's artists, this cd may be useful. On its own, it is rather uneven and sometimes clashing. The character of individual pieces is not allowed to emerge because of the great variety and inadequate organization. Also, be aware that the pieces do not always represent the character of the original albums, and that these pieces are sometimes not the best from those albums. Also, the harp is not actually very prominent on this album. On the other hand, there is a great variety of harps and styles of music here, some peaceful, some delightful, some annoying."
3,Harp Music,"Eternal Harp ""is not"" As SOOTHING As ""Carolans' Welcome"" OR ""The Faerie Isles"". It is ""satisfactory""; IF you're willing to Hear some 'More Upbeat' harp songs along with mellow harp songs."
2,BOAT CORDS,"THE PRODUCT WAS OK, BUT THE ROLLS WERE BROKEN ROLLS OF CORD. YOU CAN LOOSE A LOT OF LINE IF THE BREAK IS IN A SECTION YOU NEED AT THAT TIME."
4,A FINE COLLECTION OF CREEPY HAUNTED HOUSE STORIES...,"Ms. Lofts is a best selling author of romantic suspense and well-written historical fiction. In a preamble to this book, Ms. Lofts declares that she is a devotee of ghost stories and houses. This book is her manifestation of that interest. Ms. Lofts expertly melds her two passions, creating a crisp collection of creepy short stories with a haunted house theme that will keep the reader turning the pages. Well-written and often chilling, they are certainly well worth reading."
2,Not what I'd hoped for,"I read the first 6 stories in this book hoping that the next story would get me hooked into something spooky but to my way of thinking, the stories were just strange. I think I will give one of her historical novels a reading as they seem to get rave reviews."
2,Not A Good Choice,"I have several Atlantic pieces and I love them. This was a bad choice. #1 Too big. Does not fit in the back of a lot of vehicles. #2 Wheels are crap. Add anything as ""Piggy-back"" and good luck. #3: Weighs more."
5,Fun!,Aiko is very fun for the price! Especially if you are interested in Japanese culture. This is a great way to have fun and learn more about Japanese clothing and what a little Japanese girl would typically wear to various events and seasons. Also suggested: Chinese Mei-Mei sticker doll.
5,Easy to read and very comprehensive,"I've taken several hands-on classes on laminate installation, and this book covers everything I saw there plus more. Worth every penny. Mr. Kimball knows his craft better than most of the ""pro"" teachers I've had, but the real bonus is he can communicate what he knows. No prior knowledge is assumed, and he covers everything from how laminate was invented to how to make a completely invisible seam and the tools you need to do the job easily. If you're unsure of whether to do the job yourself, this is your book. Great stuff! P.S. He also has a great book on cabinet refacing!"
4,confirmation and fine tuning of what I thought I knew,"Very good book...Herrick uses a bit of trades people light hearted humor to bring home points. He tells you how he does different things and why. He also shows the different ways laminate work can be done. I had taught myself 12 years ago and always wondered how "" the pro's "" did it.I found out that I was doing just fine but he showed me little things that made my work better and helped me to feel that I was doin it like the pro's. He also answered the questions I had about those special attachments that I had with my router kit, that I really wasn't sure about. I easily read the book and felt that this was the kind of guy I could know and work with. If you do not know laminate work, then this book makes it easy to get started and do it right the first time. As a custom wood worker, I recommend this book to the novice as well as the expierenced. Rick Williams"
1,Rip Off,"The information is definitely valuable, but no where does it say that this book has a sticker price of $19.95 and this seller is selling it for over double the list price. I feel as though I have been ripped off"
4,Excellent reference for planning trips to WDW,"I have visited Walt Disney World six times over twenty years. For the last few trips, I've bought several travel guides. I find two to be the most useful: the Birnbaum guide and Sehlinger's Unofficial Guide. The Birnbaum book contains up-to-date essential information and is invaluable for choosing hotels, dining experiences and planning your stay. However, I must say that this is not the most objective guide -- you won't find too many critical evaluations here. The latest edition is a big improvement in layout and content over the previous year's version -- it's fun and easy to read, and packed with useful tips. The Unofficial Guide is a far more cynical and critical book -- buy both books and get everything you need for a great time at WDW!"
2,Go for the BIG Birnbaum guide instead,"My husband and I visited Disney in 1997 with the assistance of the regular Birnbaum guide. I had been to the resort a number of times (since 1978) prior and found the regular guide very helpful. The ""Disney Without Kids"" left a lot to be desired. I had hoped for a very detailed listing of restaurants as was found in the regular guide. Instead were a listing of Birnbaum's best bets, many of which we had tried before and found to be OK as far as Disney meals go. If I were planning a trip to Disney, be it with children or not, spend the extra $2 and buy the regular Birnbaum's guide. It was much more informative."
2,If your staying in the WDW resort buy this book...if not....,"This book is a great read, but is written from the perspective of Disney's Marketing Dept. and at best can qualify as a supplemental guide to other guides. The book is short and to the point, but with the usual Disney flare. Overall I enjoyed the book, but found its usefullness dwindling compared to Bob Sehlinger's Unofficial Guide to WDW. I will admit, however, that if you are staying in the WDW resort and not planning on going anywhere else, the book is ""good."" But for critiques of rides, restaurants, etc. you are going to need a different guide."
3,Informative but Bias,"Hyperion & Hearst published the book and B. Dalton's sold it, but it might as well have been mailed to me free of charge by the folks at the Disney marketing department.While the authors occassionally give a luke-warm review of certain Disney attractions and services, they seem to give just about everthing an equally unabashed, THIS-is-the-BEST-thing-since-sliced-bread recommendation. Even if it's true, it's not helpful.A terrifically informative book, with some time-saving and fewer money-saving ideas, for those seeking a ""guide"" in the true sense of the word.The New York Daily news calls it ""'official' yet insider..."" but the ""insider"" here isn't exactly a whistle-blower.For those looking for a book to frankly tell you, ""Don't waste your time or money here""--you'll have to turn to an ""unofficial"" guide."
5,Heroes of Omaha Beach,"The 115th was in the first wave assault on Omaha Beach, June 6, 1944. Nearly 80 percent of the men were killed. This book, compiled from military reports of the activities of the 115th, provides exceptional insight into the lives and actions of these brave men from the time they landed in England to prepare for the assault until they settled in as occupation troops in Bremen, Germany, following VE day. An exceptional reference for anyone researching D-Day or the Battles for St. Lo, Brest or the Ruhr River."
2,Cr*p,"Computers can be programmed in accordance with the laws of logic, and can give results to mathematical problems when the programmer creates the proper procedure.Any device that can do this must be intelligent, in the same sense as human beings.Therefore, computers are intelligent.I have saved you the trouble of reading this compilation of nonsense and outright lies (I especially liked the whopper where it was said that a computer had passed the Turing test. If you look up Turing's paper, for example in <a href =""http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0553345842/qid=1117964314/sr=2-2/ref=pd_bbs_b_2_2/104-4512575-8891160)"">The Mind's I</a>, by Hofstadter, you'll see just how big a lie this is).If your religion tells you that computers are intelligent, I won't argue. For the non-faith-based, you need evidence and reason, and Kurzweil has absolutely none.There's some interesting information scattered through this mess, but it's not worth buying for it."
5,artificial intellegence,can i know more detail about what is the artificial intellegence thank a lot.
3,S.P.I.C.,"I found this album to be simple and to the point, The good thing about this CD is the message, the music itself could use some work.But i love spanglish albums ,such as Molotov, and this ones not to to bad at all"
2,Bad design,"I purchased this for my Phil & Ted's sport stroller and it's really just a bulky fanny pack not so much a drink holder. You cannot tighten this without it getting tucked under the top shade which makes it very hard to get anything out of the cup holder. If you 'hang' it from the handlebar then it'll sway alot which is really annoying. This is NOT designed for hot drinks or cups of any kind, this is strictly a water or soda bottle holder. (bottles with caps)I guess if you were to use it as a fanny pack then it would be worth the thirty bucks but I'm not at all impressed by this. I'm also a little horrified that such a trendy company would make a bag that doubles as a fanny pack. What's going on with that?!?"
2,A little over powering,"While I like the company, these potatoes were just a little too much for me to handle, the sauce was very salty and very garlicky. I'm not sure if I would buy these again."
1,Not very safe,I do not like this product at all. It's not very safe and the tray is a real inconvenience. My 2 month old son fell out of it when I was about to fasten the tray in. I was lucky he was not hurt because I was there to catch him. I do not recommend this product.
3,okay swing,Love that it has a wall plug but the motor is weak so there is really only one speed for the swing. Baby loves the lights though!
1,Speed control not working - don't buy.,"Problem is with its motor. No matter on what speed i select out of 5 options...it swings/cradle at the same fast speed. Speed control is not working..it work as only on/off switch.Because of its FAST speed, my baby afraid to use the swing. Its completely useless for me...as it doesn't have noticeable speed differences.Don't go for it..."
3,This swing is alright,"I bought this product at a garage sale for fifty dollars.The things I like about this product are the overall design, it is very modern looking.I like that you can change the speeds for the baby and I like the colors.The music however sounded low quality.Also my baby's head always fell over the side of the swing, defeating the purpose of the head cushion. When i took the cover off to wash it I also noticed that what the baby is actually resting on is just hard plastic and there is no cushion whatsoever.Another thing I did not like is that the mobile is neutral colors. Babies love brighter colors, so my daughter basically ignores the mobile."
3,Wondeful while it lasted,"My daughter loved this swing and we did too. After about 1 1/2 months of use the swing started slowing down then died. FP is sending us a refund check for a new one. The only reason we are staying with this type of swing is because my daughter wants to go side to side not front to back. We are going to try the starlight next. If that one dies we will be going with Graco. So for those of you whos swing is slowing down, prepare yourselves for the motor to quit soon."
3,"love it, BUT!!!",I loved it untill the motor went out. We only used it a couple of days and the lights and music would stop working at random times. NOT GOOD!!!We got a replacement and the same thing happened. I still want the swing I just want it to work.
4,Love the swing!,"My daughter is 2 months old and spends a couple hours a day in this comfortable swing. At night she stares in awe at the green lighted dome strung by the butterfly mobile and falls asleep after just a few minutes.The adjustable seat is easily positioned for side-to-side and front-to-back swinging. The electric adapter is also a great feature for those who don't like to spend $10 a pop on batteries. Overall, the swing is a bit costly but is worth every penny."
3,Not as great as I thought...,"I got this swing a few months ago for my newborn. Overall, the swing is a pretty good buy, but I do have a few complaints that I would like to point out to those of you who might be thinking about getting it. The swing noise is very loud. We had our newborn in this swing because she wouldn't sleep flat on her back, and it has a loud clicking noise when it goes from side to side/front to back. The other issue I have with this item is that the seat is not sturdy. It wobbles when you switch positions, and it's just not as stable as I thought it would be for the price. That part makes it seem cheaply made. I hate to complain so much about a product, but I just wanted to let people know my thoughts.Everything else about the swing is great! It is very comfortable for the baby, with the little pillow/head support. The mobile with lights is really interesting to the baby after about 3 months. The price was best from Amazon as well. That's it! Thanks!"
1,Loved it until it quit working after 6 mos. and Amazon won't do anything to resolve,"For the 6 mos. that I was able to use the swing, it was great! I loved the various speeds, sounds, etc., what a life saver!Unfortunately, after using it for only 6 mos., it will no longer work!THE OTHER UNFORTUNATE THING IS THAT AMAZON, WHO I PURCHASED IT FROM, WILL NOT DO A THING ABOUT IT!!!!!!!I WOULD THINK TWICE ABOUT PURCHASING THIS ITEM THROUGH AMAZON."
1,swing,I purchased the Starlight swing for my infant son. In the picture the item looks blue. I just opened the swing and it is actually purple. It should specify somewhere that this item is purple.
3,cradle swing,The box was a mess all dirty and I was giving this as a baby shower gift was not in another box should have been packed better other then that OK
1,"""Where's My Stuff","Well, I am so glad that the thousands of your reviewers got the little swing, like it or not, they got it!!! I, however, ordered this product on 10/31/08; verified ""Thanks for your order"" email that day. Received another verified ""Your gift has left the arena"" email, dated 11/08. Arrived @ granddaughter's home late November and was surprised to find that she did not get delivery of the swing. To no avail, my attempts to find out where the swing is through Amazon.comllc and Fed Ex, which I paid $18.00 for delivery, met with some very and ongoing stress, as the # given to me for the order could not be accepted via their customer service site. ANDS I never received a tracking number, so Fed Ex was useless via their automated service. So, tomorrow I attend my only granddaughter's baby shower without a gift for my first Great Grandson. AND I have Amazon.com to thank for this!!!"
1,NOT GOOD,IN EUROPE NO ONE IS PUTTING THEIR BABIES FACING UP. BABIES SHOULD BE ON THEIR STOMACH MOST OF THE TIME IN ORDER TO MAKE BRAIN CONNECTIONS. BESIDES BABIES SHOULD BE ABLE TO GO TO THEIR TOYS. THIS MOTION THING BELIEVE IT OR NOT FRUSTATE BABIES AND MAKE THEM BELIEVE THAT TOYS ARE COMING TO THEM. BABIES NEED TO MOVE. NOT THE TOY.
4,I like it but baby so so,"Baby is about 3 months old now and we have had the swing for about 2 weeks. I like many of the feature such as batteries not required, the mobile and stars for the baby to watch and 3 swing angles. Baby likes to sit and watch the mobile but is not happy with the swinging motion for some reason. The papasan cradle only has two recline positions, laid back and very layed back. This is ok since the baby is not able to hold its head up anyway. Swing motor is a bit noisey, louder than I expected. This likely explains why the softest music setting seems a bit loud too. Bottom line: Lots of nice features, stable, looks comfy but my 3 month old could do without it. I am guessing she will like it better in a month or so."
4,Great for some hands free time!,"I finally broke down and bought this for my son a few weeks ago when he was a little over a month old. When he is in a good mood he loves to stare at the mirror and the rotating mobile. It can keep him happy for about 20 minutes and he will sometimes fall asleep in it. After weeks of constantly holding him it can be very helpful for some hands free time to do things like make dinner etc. However, it's not a miracle swing because if he is grumpy he is unlikely to stop crying just because he is in the swing ;) Still, I would recommend it. I haven't had to replace the D batteries yet and we've used it quite a bit. There is a noise associated with the rocking/motor but it isn't that loud and is overpowered by the music/noises if you turn it up. I like all the options for music/noise. I think he likes the music choice best but the crickets etc. are a nice alternative."
4,My baby stays calm,"My baby loves this swing. We've been using it since he was born. This frees me up during the day to get chores done and I love this product. The only con is that the motor is not silent, like some previous reviewers noted. It makes a creaking/clunking sound- almost like a moving train. But, then again, that seems to calm the baby and help him sleep. I highly recommend this swing."
3,"BEAUTIFUL DESIGN, but flawed","I love the aesthetics of this swing through and through, but we've used it now for just two months and it's squeaking and creaking. I've called Fisher Price and they are more than happy to replace it, but I have to detach and send them the seat component, which is such a hassle. I suppose I understand that they don't want me to have to send back the whole thing, yet don't want me to have two complete swings, but again, with a two month old, this is really a hassle. We're going to try to WD40 it and then if needs be, return the seat portion. *sigh*"
2,Washing disaster. Padding falls apart after one wash.,After one wash (done according to the care instructions) the top of the cushion was completely pilled up and the underside batting had holes. We plan to contact Fisher Price regarding the issue.
2,Inconsistent Speed and Rattling noise on Mobile,"When i first got it and set it up, I wasnt sure if the product was working properly. My daugther was only 2 weeks old, when I first put her on this. I was surprised that the cradle hardly shook. It kept making a rattling noise, it would stop and then shake a little and then stop... When i took the baby out, the cradle would swing vigorously, inspite of setting in speed 1. Then yesterday, the mobile began to make a rattling noise. I think mine came with a faulty motor. I am going to return this item."
2,Only one speed,"I was really excited to see all the great reviews on this swing - and honestly, it is a great swing. My daughter loves being in it. When she was about 4 weeks old, we bought this swing and it was a lifesaver. Unfortunately, this swing only goes one speed, even though it says it goes 6. I called customer service and they told me the turnaround for a new swing would be 6-8 weeks because they had none in stock. That is really frustrating, I must say. So I opted to let it go and just deal with it. I wish I hadn't - now the option to turn on the starry sky along with the moving mobile works sporadically. I had read previous reviews about the motor smoking so I'm wondering if this is the start to a faulty swing... :(I would've given this a 5 star rating if they could've replaced the swing within 2 weeks at the most - but 2 MONTHS... just not acceptable."
4,Pretty good and helps me put her down!,I bought this swing when my daughter was 2 months old hated being put down if she was in a good mood the swing worked great and she enjoys the music choices. As with all things there are a few things that I did not likeNegatives:Large foot print difficult to move from room to roomLight show has proven to be useless my daughter doesn't even notice itThe toys on the mobile are pastel and boring babys like bright and bold so I took them down and put my own onThe swing is pricey but when it comes to moving parts and my baby I didnt want to be cheap she is 4 months now and really likes napping in her swing!
5,A wonderful buy!!,"Not only does my granddaughter look sweet as pie in this cradle swing, but it does things I never imagined. You start it out as a cradle and just a little turn and it's a swing. Plus all the entertainment! Only one small issue is that it says there are different speeds of swinging, but no matter what speed I set it on, it still swings the same as every other setting. Overall, an excellent and beautiful cradle swing."
1,Dissappointing,"I heard really good things about this swing and was excited to find out that the starlight model can be run with batteries or be plugged into an outlet. But there are just too many negatives:1. The seat has a strange angle that was never comfortable for our little one2. The speed control on the swing started malfunctioning after about a month and it started to speed up uncontrollably3. It stopped working after just 3 months4. It was pretty loud. We compared it to the floor models in the store but the noise seems to be ""normal"" for this model and not some sort of defect.Wouldn't recommend it."
3,Cute but not durable...,After having this swing only about 2 months it barely swings now....when I put it on the fastest speed it looks like it in slo-mo. Just thought it would have lasted longer...only been putting my newborn in it and she was a petite baby. The design is so cute and the light projections are awesome but just doesn't swing very good. I would have liked to get more swinging out of it. Pretty easy to assemble and I like that you have the option to use batteries or plug it in to the wall.
1,It's purple - not blue!!,"I loved this product with the pictures online and the concept for my new little boy on the way looking up at the stars, rocking, etc... But then I acutally saw the swing the checks on the canopy are purple - NOT BLUE!! They make the pink one (obviously girl!) and then I figured that the blue one would be boy - but purple!! (not so much boy!!) The other option is to go with another swing that is pretty neutral such as the nature one, but why can't they make one for a BOY!!"
2,Upset Grandbaby,So we bought the Fisher price Tree party swing and did not have it not even four months and my daughter gets upset and tells me the motor went out. She was careful after reading the reviews to not use the lights and music on the swing as to make it last longer. I called Fisher Price and they want me to send the whole swing back so they can replace the motor...when I ask them if they were paying the shipping on this...they informed me no it would be at our expense. I than ask if I could just send the motor back they once again informed me no. My grandbaby loves her swing just to sit in but I finally told my daughter just get rid of it...I went to WalMart and bought her one that works....I miss the old days of the hand crank ones so much for this all pretty stuff cause we are paying more for junk....One mad Grandma.Fisher-Price Tree Party Cradle 'n Swing
5,Lifesaver Swing,"I absolutely LOVE this swing. My son loves to be held in a cradle position, like his carseat, and this swing. He prefers being held, but that isn't always an option, and this swing is perfect. He takes his naps in this swing, he isn't old enough to enjoy the toy bar or the mobile yet, but I love the nature and music sounds. And the fact that is has two different swing positions. The only downfall I think this swing has, is that it doesn't have the plug in option, like the Fisher Price Rainforest Cradle swing. Which is weird, since they are the same type of swing, Fisher Price just didn't give the Papasan swing the wall plug in option. Be prepared to go through about 4 D batteries a month, but it is WELL worth it. And honestly, as much as we use this swing, 4 weeks isn't bad at all to go through only 4 batteries. I'll spend $5 a month on batteries if it comes to my son being happy and sleeping well. I would buy this swing over and over again, and recommend it to everyone."
5,Best Baby Item Ever!,"This swing is large, and it does not plug in. However, the batteries last a long time, and it is the best baby item ever! This swing helped my baby sleep EVERY DAY for the first 6-7 months. I could not have lived without it. I have had no technical problems whatsoever. If you buy one, just keep your paperwork and return it if it breaks. I expect there are some ""lemons"" out there, but the majority are fine."
4,Good,"Works well, good product. Would have been excellent if they had connection to direct power outlet."
5,Fisher-Price Starlight Papasan Swing,We went around asking all of our friends the one thing that was a must have. They all answered a swing that was multi-directional. We picked the starlight papasan out originally for its looks and are now enjoying the perks of the swing it self. We love the fact that you can choose to battery operate or plug in and use the swing. Our daughter has loved it since day one and is now 2 months old and is still enjoying it. The only problem we have had which we thought something was wrong with the light and mobile was the netting had slipped out on one side and was catching the mobile which was cathcing and getting the mobile and lights stuck. A quick call to Fisher-Price customer service and she had us back up and running by placing the net back in its groove. Great swing we couldn't complain!
1,Power plug stopped working,"I love that swing can move to swing back and forth or side to side. Having the option of using either the wall outlet or batteries were great. We bought this for our daughter in 2011 and she used it for a few months. We put it away and just took it out for our 2nd child. We plugged it in and it worked for a week or so. Then it stopped. After some research, I found out this is a common problem with the swing. The motor and power plug needs to be replaced. Seems to happen after taking it out of storage, but not necessarily. Batteries worked, but I am constantly changing the batteries."
4,"Just a little info on the ""fire hazard"".","This swing uses a dc motor which all dc motors spark due to the commutator brushes that are installed and are required for the unit to run. The swing uses either 4D batteries or the ac adapter(transformer) which changes the AC power into DC power for the swing to operate. The sparks are totally normal and should cause no alarm. The brushes are made of carbon material which do have a smell to them kind of like a burning smell. If you have a power tool plug it in and smell where you see the sparks. I have no doubt that you will smell the same smell that you do from the swing. Believe me I am a father of 3 and I would never do anything to place my children in harms way. However, Fisher-Price could do a better job explaining this to customers and this would solve alot of concerns. I have been an aviation mechanic for 15 years and typically see this in all DC motors."
1,Not a lot of quality for $159.99,"For the price of this cradle/swing, I'd hoped for a lot more quality and reliability than I got. First, the stand seemed a little wobbly--you really need to make sure that the feet are as wide as possible when setting it up as they don't lock into an optimal position. Even worse, however, is that after less than two days of use, the lights, sound, and mobile stopped working. Calls to ""customer service"" were a complete waste of time and I ended up returning the item. While the netting and other features appeared attractive and desirable, I'd have to recommend purchasing a less expensive Papasan cradle/swing."
1,choking hazard!,"This swing almost killed our daughter! At first we loved this swing for our newborn daughter, until at about age 4 months, she grabbed the netting and started sucking on it. The netting tore in to large pieces in her mouth. She had no teeth at this point. I heard her making choking noises and was horrified to find her mouth full of the fabric. She had swallowed some of it, and other peices were caught in her throat. She used to nap in the swing. If I hadn't been right there, she absolutely could have choked to death. Although we notified Fisher Price, and the CPSC, we never heard any follow up. We sent the netting to Fisher Price for them to analyze, but they never gave us any comment or explanation. The swing is lovely, but please remove the netting! It is an absolute death hazard!"
2,Great but.....,"My baby loves, loves, loves this swing. We love it because it swings two ways. If he gets fussy swinging one way, we turn him around and swing him the other way.Now, the reason for the two stars: the motor went out... Twice! We purchased the first swing in December 06. In February the motor went out and we had to get another one. Then just today, April 25, 07 the motor conked out AGAIN!We don't even turn on the lights for our baby because they distract him. All he ever does is swing. I don't think we got a lemon.... TWICE! I think it's a flaw in the motor.Someone talked about this item not being sturdy. It doesn't feel sturdy but it is. It has to stand on two legs because you need to turn the swing. We've never had any problems with it breaking down. We only have motor issues.At $159 the motor should not go out. I'd stay away from it.If you can get another model that swings both ways, do that. That's the only feature that is absolutely fantastic about it."
3,"So good, but so bad","This swing is hard to give a rating for me.Our baby loves it. He loves to look up at the mobile and mirror above him. I feel that he is secure and stable in the swing. The batteries seem to last quite a while-we use rechargeables for this. All of these things give it 5 stars in my book.But... on our swing-and I've noticed on a few other reviews-as it rotates around the top, the mobile gets hung up on the bar that holds the seat and makes a sharp, loud clunking noise. This noise continues until you physically move it just a bit. In the meantime, the peaceful angel resting below is startled awake. There are these little animals that spin and go up and down as they rotate around the mirror. The timing must be just off or something that they get caught in mid-spin. It's really too bad, because our baby loves the mobile."
3,Good swing for a newborn....,"I did a ton of research before deciding on this swing for my little one. I have to admit it was a lifesaver for the first 2 months, but beyond that has proven pretty much useless. She is almost 4 months old now and is already bored with it. There really isn't much that she can ""do"" with the swing, the music and lights are very soothing for sleep but not stimulating for play.That said, if you have the money to upgrade to a more mature swing when the little one hits about 4 months I would still recommend this cradle swing. It really is wonderful for a fussy newborn."
4,What a Great Product!,"My husband and I read reviews on EVERYTHING before we buy it. I spent a few weeks looking at swings and finally decided this was the one that would be best for our daughter to be. We made the right choice. For the fist month and a half of her life this is the only place she would fall sleep. It really does not take up that much room, and it is very cute and neutral. It was very easy to put together, and it is very sturdy. She likes the rotating mobile, and can just stare at it and giggle. One drawback is that the music will get stuck in your head for weeks and you'll be able to sing nothing else haha. At 2 months old, Isabella is starting to get bored with it, and the days of it rocking her to sleep are over, but for the time we used it she absolutely loved it!"
2,Fisher Price Star Craddle Swing,The product only has one speed. Fisher price sent us a second motor but we still have the same problem. The swing is cute but it goes to slow to soothe the baby. It barely moves at all:(
3,Not for a Small House,"I really liked this swing and so did my baby, but this thing is HUGE! I had to move furniture out of the living room to set it up and use it. It took up so much space that I had to sell it and buy a smaller one. If I had a much larger house, I would have kept it. If you have the room, get it."
2,"Please think twice, the speeds are crazy","I requested this item on my baby registry. It is beautiful and is very easy to assemble. The main problem I have is the speed, which is almost as important as the construction of the swing. There seems to be no middle groud between not moving and light speed. The instructions actual say that if you have a ligher childer, which I did, that you should put a towel behind the swing to create some drag and slow it down. I did try beacuse I wanted to make sure I exhausted all methods of using the swing. The tray does not come off easliy and my daughterr never enjoyed this lovely swing."
3,Really love the design BUT PURPLE is for girls,I bought this for my son thinking it was blue and I when I opened the box is was cleary a pretty shade of lavander. The pictures and description on line were not that clear on the color but it is in fact Purple. The star feature that the mobile is very sweet romantic and dreamy.I exchanged it for the little lamb which I think looks gender nuetral. If I had a girl I would have kept it.
3,nice but noisy,"Easy to put together, and a nice product for the most part. The swing is actually noisy. I thought it would be quiet, but it makes a grinding noise when it is turned on and going. ): Other than that I like the light show and music/sounds."
5,EXCELLENT PRODUCT!!! VERY HAPPY,"Beautiful swing. My baby absolutely loves it!! There are so many options to choose from like the way she swings, the lights on, butterflies moving, songs that are played. I can say that she is comfortable enough to take naps in it. Very strong and sturdy. Swing is deep enough where baby won't fall out. Once again beautiful product that I love and my baby loves. Thanks Amazon!!"
3,Nice swing,I loved it. The baby didn't. There were no defects and there was no reason the baby shouldn't have loved it. But...he didn't. Maybe the next one will.
4,papasan cradle,this was a really good buy bought it for my daughter in law i will be making more purchases just dont know yet what
5,Heaven!,My little ones seem to love swing time. I put them in the swing for most of the time when they are only a few months old. I love that this one plugs into the wall. Had one before that we spent a fortune on batteries. Love the lights and the music on this one. Like I said it is Heaven and a life saver!
5,Amazing & Much Needed 'Tool' for New Moms!,"My sisters 'package' came about 5 weeks early and 1 week before her baby shower! Auntie to the rescue! I had planned on a less expensive (ok cheap) gift but after laying my eyes on that cute kid, I wanted ONLY the best! So I ran out to the stores found the perfect item, BUT wait! It wasnt in stock! Who ya gonna go to? AMAZON! I wrote down the model # and headed home! 2 days later and $21 cheaper, I had this wonderful crib/swing. 1 day later the 1st Time Mom and her Prince arrived home. Mom was in a lot of pain and the little one wasnt backing down! The swinging mode & light was just what the doctor ordered! My sister told me it (the cradle/swing) is a real life saver and he loves it! My nephew is 3 weeks old now and its the only place he'll quietly retreat to when not being held. This is a MUST BUY!"
3,Motor issues,"We received ours a week ago for our 2 month old daughter. It was pretty easy to put together and I had it up and running within an hour. Well, the minute we put our 12lb daughter in it the motor started making loud noises and the swing would hardly move (on the highest setting)...Our little one seems to love it so i ordered a replacement-hopefully we won't have the same issue. Overall, the swing looks great and keeps my daughter entertained and comfortable."
2,A baby girl must have!,"I must admit, this is the third one of these swings that we have had. The first two did not function properly, they would not swing side to side..but the third one was a charm! My daughter loves this swing! The seat is very soft and padded well. The headrest is a must! At first she did not care about the light show at all, but now that she is three months she loves the light show and the butterflies, they make her smile! The only reason I get ANY sleep at night is due to this swing. I just keep it on side to side with the lowest setting and she can sleep up to eight hours without making a sound. The music choices are nice, and the natures sounds are great! I would recommend this swing to anyone!!! I would also recommend getting through (...) because their price is the best, and they are really nice if you need to return a defected item. Hope this helps you decide!!!"
1,stopped working after three months,"Do not buy this product!! It is overpriced, and it broke after 3 months...only used it once or twice a week.. this basicaly broke after less than 20 times of usage"
1,Motor went out,"My son did love this swing and I loved the fact that it plugged into the wall. And then the motor broke. I used it for six months. My son wasn't ready to stop using it but I opted to use the crib full time at this point. I would have liked the opportunity to sell it, but who wants a broken swing? All the other features work: lights, music. While it worked he did love it. But I can't give it more than one star since it gave out on me. I used a graco for my daughter that was handed down a couple of times already and it never broke. I would have used it with my son, but it was pink. All in all, it was a really good swing but be ready for the hassle in case the motor gives. BTW he was less than 15 pounds when it broke and the max weight is 25."
3,Way too fast!,"I bought this swing from Babies R Us after reading all of the great reviews because I needed something to entertain my baby that reclined enough (she has acid reflux). Unfortunately when we got it home and set it up we found that it swings way too fast, even in the slowest setting! The swinging motion is also a little loud, but that wouldn't bother me if I weren't so worried about the swing making my baby sick or worse being unsafe. It seems particularly unsafe since it is just a 3-point harness system."
2,Not Safe!!!!!!!!,"This swing was great for about three weeks. Then it started to stop running. The motor ran, but there was no movement. This happened once in a while, but the baby really loved it, so I dealt with that.And then the whole seat came off; the screw holding the seat to the motor slipped through the assemply. They drilled too big, or it wore through. Either way, the bolt and nut were connected, and still dropped out onto the floor, and the baby in the swing fell with it.The ONLY reason I am giving this two stars is because of the fast response from Fisher Price in fixing the problem by refunding me. They are good with customer relations, unlike Evenflo. So, Thanks FP for fixing the problem. I just am sorry I had one to begin with."
1,Swings too fast and too loud,"Bought this with great expectations after reading the other reviews. Problems were evident immediately, though.1. The swing is MUCH too fast on the lowest setting. My 1 month old son starts to scream in terror after 5 minutes in the swing as it picks up momentum. By choosing a cheap driving mechanism, Fisher Price has no control over the actual speed of the swing. If they implemented a gear system, they could - but it would cut into their profit margin.2. The motor is quite loud when starting up - pops and clicks. Once it reaches speed, it's quiet - but the swing is too fast at that point to be comfortable.3. The seat cushion is VERY thin and cheaply made. It has barely any cushioning material and can hardly be called 'papasan.'All in all, very disappointed with this product. It could have been better and frankly terrifies my son."
2,Great swing.... until it stopped working forever....,"A friend gave me this swing, and it worked fine until today. The swing just stopped swinging. Everything else works fine, and I've recharged the batteries completely, so I know it's not that. The mobile still spins, and all the music still plays perfectly, it just doesn't swing.... I even opened it up to see if something was loose, but after doing some research online I've noticed people are buying replacement parts for $53, which isn't worth it for me to fix... I'm guessing this swing worked for about 6 months total, so if you're planning on using it for multiple children, or buying used, don't waste your time with this one!!"
4,"Good swing, Nature's Touch N1973","We've been using this swing for 4 1/2 months now and it has worked good for us. The baby likes it and naps in it occassionally. There are a few things about it that I don't care for though. For one, I wish I had bought one that plugs in the wall. This one takes D batteries, which we've replaced once so far. Another is the characters on the mobile face out, not down, so the baby just sees the bottoms of them moving, which I think makes it pointless to have them on there, but she likes the mirror. Other than that it's good. We haven't had any mechanical problems so far. It was pretty easy to assemble, I did it by myself while pregnant and it didn't take very long. All in all it's worked good for us so far, it keeps the baby content and entertained while I get things done around the house."
2,Too fast and hard to get baby in and out...,We bought this swing per reviews and my son was born over 7 pounds and the swing was so fast I thought he was going to fly out. Plus trying to get a newborn in and out of this swing is a nightmare because it's so low and the way it's designed makes it very hard for someone tall to lift the baby out. Poor design. I think I should have bought a Graco like our first child.
1,No AC Adaptor,"They don't explicitly say this on the box, but I think it's important everyone know that this product only works on batteries. Of course, I figured this out after I brought it home and assembled. My first thought was ""Why would any company, ever, make on of these without an AC adaptor? Who wants to spend money on batteries over and over again?""I returned this product and bought a Graco that I""m happy with."
1,worst product ever!!,I bought this for my daughter and the firs thing that happened was the mobile started to make a horriable clicking noise that scared my daughter and then the swing stoped working and sometimes it didnt ever work at all! Then when I tried to get a credit back for it Amazon was not corperative with me and they only gave me 50% back. I would not recommend this product to anyone or this company to anyone!!!
2,Too ugly to even look at!,"Don't get me wrong...I didn't buy a swing just so it would look nice in my living room. But, this swing is AWFUL to look at! The fabrics don't coordinate at all. Looks like there were several fabric scraps thrown together. Purple, light blue, creme, and orange floral. Ugh!The swing worked okay, but was very loud and made a clicking noise when it was on. I couldn't stand the clicking or the appearance so I sent it back. I purchased the ""My Little Lamb"" swing (from the same series) and we've been very happy with it. It's quiet...and cute!"
2,Would Have Been Better If It Had The Option To Plug It Into An Outlet Via AC Adapter,"Like all the other positive reviews this swing will entertain your baby as well as lull it to sleep.However I don't know about you but I don't like purchasing D Batteries every week. I have twins and two of these lil lamb swings. We go through batteries like you wouldn't believe. Why didn't they include the option of plugging in a wall charger or some kind of AC Adapter. I would have given 5 stars but since you can't plug this into a wall outlet I'm only giving it two stars.Summary:Will put your kids to sleep, but it will also kill your wallet by making you buy batteries every other week."
5,Wish we had it sooner!!!,"My babe is 3 months old and we just 'inherited"" this from a friend. It is AMAZING. We've been using the take a long swings and those seem so hard and uncomfortable now compared to this swing! She stopped wanting to sit in the take a longs about a month ago, but she has sat in this one multiple times today. Such a magical swing, it is huge though!!! (my hubs minds, if my baby likes it I could care less how big it is!)"
5,AWESOME SWING!,"This swing is absolutely awesome and cute. The baby loves it and I even get so many compliments on it. It's a lifesaver, I use it more than the playpen. I LOVE IT!!!"
5,Wonderful Swing!!,"This swing is a GREAT buy! It is very cute and my baby loved it! He mainly liked to sleep in it as he is quite the busy body and always has been, so he would get mad if I put him in it for him to play, but he would always take his afternoon nap in the swing! He was always anxious to play with the mobile when he'd wake up and loved to look at himself in the mirror above him! I think it does really well with batteries. We have had it 7 months and it's been used every day sometimes swinging for three hours or more and I've only had to change the batteries three times. The seat is very soft and has fleece type fabric to cradle babies head, so I think it is especially great for newborns! This swing is a wonderful buy and I would highly recommend it!"
3,Nothing great,"The swing came with a tilted seat. The waist belt was too short for my 2.5 month old normal sized baby. Raised a ticket with fisher price for the manufacturing defect, will be returning the product for a refund. Running on electricity is the only advantage."
4,I love this swing,"This is a beautiful swing, and I was so excited for my son to use it. He hated it at first, but personally I don't think a newborn fits in the papasan style seat well. Now it gets him to sleep (for a nap) in a few minutes, and he will stay in it for hours. The infant headrest has some need for improvement too. The legs also need a ton of room to spread out (this thing is NOT compact at all). My son likes the moving mobile at the top. I don't think he even notices the pretty star lights that are moving around, although I enjoy it. :) The music selections are nice too. I'm impartial about the cradle swing. He doesn't prefer it over the regular swinging motion."
5,Quiet time in less than 10 seconds,"I love this swing. My baby loves this swing. Depending on his mood and how fussy he is, it's nice to be able to vary the motion direction (e.g. side to side, back N forth), the relaxing sounds, and to turn on the mobile & lights when he's extra fussy. The mobile stars and teddy bears dance up and down and I love the stars, how they reflect off the curtain.I wish there was a master on/off switch so, even though you can control each of the elements individually, so that you could turn them off/on all together. However, I end up using the AC adapter/battery toggle to do this..."
1,"Great, until it broke!","Got this swing months before my son was born. Everything worked great at first and the lights were adorable. Has many options for swing speeds, options of having music off or music on with lights or not at all. The swing adjustment is great, my son preferred the side to side swinging. My son loved it and put him right to sleep in the side to side position My baby used it a total of 5 times, FIVE TIMES. And now the only thing that works is the swinging motion. The lights nor the music no the mobile will turn on! I noticed the music and lights lagged to turn on, but it finally gave out. and it only took 5 times. I will be calling to see if its recalled or they have a replacement part they could send me. HUGELY disappointing!!"
2,Swings too slow!,"The Papasan Starlight Cradle Swing has great songs & nature sounds, I love that it swings in two directions, that the 2nd seat position is comfy and almost lying flat (my 2-month-old baby only naps in her swing and I wanted something bed-like that was comfortable), and I also like the light-show on the overhead mobile; however, this swing was not FAST enough...it barely moved my baby - even on the highest setting!!"
3,Weak Motor - same as one found in airwick air freshener,"We bought this swing secondhand, and it failed within a few days. My husband found by searching with google that the swing can be refurbished by replacing the motor with one from an airwick air freshener - there is a website detailing how to make the fix. Now the swing works well and my little one is enjoying it. I am somewhat shocked that this product uses such a cheap motor, but I guess it makes sense considering how frequently they fail. My husband says that he found in his research that all the other swings are powered in pretty much the same way."
3,"Excellent, but Self-Destructs","We bought this swing for our new baby. It was a great swing at first, with the neat starlight show, rotating mobile, variable swing positions, and decent music system (well, it's not going to win awards, but better than most toys). All-in-all we've been delighted with it, except that the mobile & lights failed after only 3 weeks of using the swing. Nothing abusive was done to the swing. Annoyingly, we had bought it a little before the baby was born, and the warrantee was expired. My wife has found numerous reviews online that reflect our experience.In short, it appears to be a great product that's designed to self-destruct. I suppose this makes sense from a business perspective. This has a pretty limited useful lifespan for a single baby, and it would be easy for a dozen or so durable swings to serve an entire community."
2,safety hazard,My two month old enjoys this swing and it usually puts him to sleep. I have to watch him very close though because if he leans forward his head comes out of the headrest and he can't get seated back. The first time I was scared to death to look up and find him folded over with his head halfway down the side of the swing. I have since tightened the safety harness (he was wearing it that time too) but he can still get knocked out of place. I know some parents let their babies sleep in the swing but I fear that is a putting a baby at risk for positional asphyxiation or falling out if someone is not watching very closely.
4,Nice swing....a few problems,"First let me say this is a great swing. It is so cute and the light feature with stars and the different swinging settings is great. Oh, and I cannot forget the fact that I can plug it in to an outlet and not have to keep buying batteries is a major plus. There are also problems like:1. pain to put together2. sometimes I have to push the swing to get it to swing3. Light and mobile stop working a lot and I have to always restart. This may be because my little one is in it so much 'cause he loves it.So, enjoy the swing but don't expect it to be perfect...really what product is these days...."
3,"Not Bad, I Think","We have had this swing a little over a month now, I have a 4 month old. For some reason the swing is slowing down I'm not sure if it's because of weight gain, I know it holds up to 25 lbs but my son is only 15.14 so I just don't know. I do like the mobile it distracts the baby for about 10 minutes. He doesn't really care for the music. A big negative is that the head rest doesnt come off. I like the swing but the baby doesn't really care for it, I'm not sure if he's uncomfortable or he just wants to be held."
2,Doesn't last,"I absolutely loved this swing, as did my baby, until it stopped working! It was only about 5 months old when the motor stopped working. So disappointing!"
3,papasan cradle,nice cradle but for some reason my grandson doesnt care for it. the handmedown bouncer works better. if u know someone with one test drive first before spending the money
2,Wish it did the basics better,"this swing was recommended to us by a few friends and a publication as a solution to infants that only fall asleep in arms. we were very excited to purchase this swing and put it together right away. everything was so cute, the little mobile, canopy and the music was soothing etc. however we were very disappointed to plug it in and find that the swing function in either direction was minimal. we used brand new batteries, tried just plugging it in, giving it a swing to get it going (as often is the case with swings) switched directions and nothing helped, with or without or 10lb baby this thing has no umph!we were very sad to pack it up. we're still using a loaner old Graco battery model just during the day. it must be 2 + years old and has more vigor in its rocking motion than this one. dont add all the frills until you get the fundamentals down!!!"
4,Good swing,I am very happy that I purchased the Fisher-Price mocha butterfly cradle swing. I am a single mother and if it weren't for this swing I would never get anything done. My almost 3 month old wants to be held all the time. The only break that I get from holding her is when she is in this swing. She loves it. She has severe acid reflux so the doctor doesn't recommend laying her flat so this swing works well for us. I love that I don't have to purchase batteries. The reason I didn't give it 5 stars because the mobile doesn't always work but I don't mind much because she is usually asleep and if she is awake she isn't interested in it.
2,Pretty swing but didn't work for us.,The swing is lovely - colors are great but it's tight fitted - no space. My grandbaby was only 3 months and it was snug. The head support it sewed on therefore you can't remove it. The tray is a chore to take off and put on. The lightshow was great but the knobs and music worked at random. I returned it.
2,Poor,"One speed, not 6. Can't hear music over noisy motor. Angle baby rests is poor. Would not recommend!!!!!"
1,Cute Swing but noisy after a while,"We used this swing the first few months, but not that often and after a while while the motor became so loud that we just stopped using it all together. Very cute, but the motor is of poor quality for the price... things would turn off on their own and have to be restarted - I would just go with another one."
1,Motor did'nt work at all,"I opened the package and spent time putting it together. I am 37 weeks pregnant so it wasnt hard to put together at all. It is a very beautiful swing however, as soon as I plugged the swing in, nothing worked. I called and went through trouble shooting with the representative, and still nothing. I was then told to purchase 4 D batteries to see if its the motor or the plug in adapter. I refused to go purchase batteries for something that doesnt work when I plug it in so, what I did was I took the plug in adapter and used it to see if I can make something in the house that takes the same adapter work. It worked..so that let me know it was the motor. I called Fisher-Price and they said the motor wasnt available until Saturday and I wouldbt be getting it for another 7 to 10 business days after it arrived. I just hope I dont have my baby until then and yeah they are replacing it but its a pain in the butt to have to wait longer for something that didnt work when I received it."
1,Waste of money!,"I purchased 2 of these swings for my twins! What a complete waste of money! After 2 months, both the swings have completly stopped working! Contacting customer service was a waste of time. I am now going to have to purchase 2 more swings and I can tell you that they will NOT be fisher-price!"
5,Love it !,Great product. Love the colours and design. Baby just loves the lights and sound. Very comfortable and safe for baby. Soothing rock to fall asleep.
3,Everything look ok but little bit noisy,Swing design and looks fine but little bit noisy so if you sensitive to sound and share room with your kids then i will suggest to other one with less noisy.
2,Not worth the cost,"I loved this swing, I should have read the reviews before registering for it! With in the first month of using it, the mobile did not work anymore. Fisher price expected me to take it apart and trouble shoot it... When on earth did I have time for that. We started using the portable bouncer/swing.I pulled this swing out to use on my second child. After using it 3 or 4 times it decided not work at all. SAVE YOUR MONEY AND BUY A BETTER SWING!"
5,Great buy. Worth the money,Wasnt a horrible price easy assembly. Its the second one we had. Didnt want to put my son in a pink one. I recommend this product to everyone with a baby or about to have one
2,Cheap but you get what you pay for,It worked ok for a couple of months but soon I started seeing some of the issues other reviewers saw - creaking and the loud clicks whenever the lights are activated. Guaranteed to wake a sleeping baby. Why FP hasn't fixed this known issue is strange to say the least.
2,Motor Died,"I LOVED this swing and was so happy when I bought it, but after using it for one month, the motor died. I was very disappointed."
3,It could be better,"I really like the swing but for the amount I paid I'm disappointed that the canopy doesn't attach very well and if you don't attach it well then it makes a loud clicking sound when the mobile is on and startles our baby. I called customer service and the first thing they said to try was to take off the canopy to see if the clicking stopped, it was kind of like they were aware of that problem already and must get that call a lot. I reattached the canopy and made sure it snapped (which you can hardly tell if it does snap or not) and it worked good for a while and then a few weeks later it started doing it again and this time it kept clicking even afer I took the canopy off. I am going to call customer service again soon. I also don't like how the swing clicks and hums if the legs aren't spread out all the way- like I said it is a great swing, but for the money we paid for it I would have liked to see the swing built better and not so touchy."
4,"Very Nice, Just Not Very Fast","This is a great swing, very ideal for younger babies... But, we had a used swing before this from Graco and the swing speeds were much faster and that's what my daughter liked was the faster speeds.She LOVED the light up butterfly mobile though. Again, great for little babies, it cradles them perfect and entertains them. It just wasn't fast enough for my little girl's preference."
2,fisher price starlight papasan cradle swing,"I am not at all impressed with this swing. We previously had the fisher price ocean wonders swing and I loved it. Infact, we owned two of them and the only reason I didn't buy another one is because they are nearly twice the price we paid previously when our now four year old daughter was a baby. I figured that this cradle swing would be a good choice because of the reviews and the fact that it is the same maker but all of the speed settings are the same whether it is on one or the fastest setting and even the fastest is super slow. Also, the swing is loud. Our daughter loved the ocean wonders one and to get this one in comparrison is such a dissapointment. I rate it two stars because it doesn't soothe her the way I thought it should because of the slow speed."
2,Way too fast for a newborn,"This is a very cute swing with nice music, but even on the lowest speed, it is way too fast for a newborn baby. I end up pushing the swing with my hands so that it swings for a few minutes on its own inertia until I have to push it again. Maybe for older babies the first speed is ok, but not for my 3 week old. Also, they should really make an option to plug it in and perhaps making the colors of the mobile more vibrant."
3,Great for the first 3 months,"I loved this swing for the first three months. This swing was the only thing that would calm him down and relax him. When he was 3 months old, I put him in it one day and left the room to go to the bathroom. I came back in to find him screaming because he almost fell out of it and was completely sideways almost hanging. PLEASE be careful especially if you have an active child."
4,Swinging Swing!,"We bought this swing 2 weeks ago, and my 7 week old loves it! However the other reviewers are right on, there is only ONE SPEED! Which makes no sense, there are six slots to turn to and the speed stays the same, which worries me when she grows. I am hoping the motor holds.I can't find 16 songs for the life of me, I have found 8 and lots of nature noises. Plugging it in is the way to go, I don't have to worry about getting up to restart the music so that makes it worth the price. We got a great deal on sale at Amazon, which I love by the way, for $116.00 Other swings are about the same with tax so I would recommend it."
5,sansationable,i bought this swing for my friends new born baby. this swing was easy to put together. and she became very fusy for a week but when i gave him this swing the baby loved it and didnt cry much after that. now she loves being in her swing. and its good for new born and growing babys
1,This swing does not work,"We purchased this swing a few days ago for our 6 week old son to use. When the swing arrived, the adapter was not working. We decided to go ahead and order a replacement adapter, and used batteries until the adapter arrived.We immediately noticed that the swing could not handle having the light, music, or mobile on at the same time as the swing. Even with everything else off, though, the swing could barely move if our child was sitting in it. He is only 9 pounds, so it's not a weight issue. Since we had already ordered the adapter, we decided to wait and see if that solved the issues.Well, I received the adapter this morning and hooked it up, hoping that the swing would now work. I was disappointed. Even with a brand new adapter, the swing can hardly move if our son is in it. And by hardly move, I mean it might swing an inch or two each way...if we're lucky.If I could give this swing 0 stars, I would. It does not perform its function at all."
3,Like it except for the scary motor sound,We got this swing for a baby shower gift. Its cute and I like the idea of it but cant figure out if the spooky motor noise as it swings back and forth is on purpose or not. We tried putting weight in the swing (my poor min-pin dog- he was a trooper since our daughter has yet to arrive) and it still made this funny noise. Think Im going to return it.
5,Swing,This is an amazing swing!!! Thank you! My sister loved it for her new baby! This item arrived before they said it would so 5 stars plus thumbs up!!!
4,The tray can get frustrating,The one and only thing I do not like about this swing is the tray. It is either all the way on or off. I really wish it would open and close rather then on or off
3,doesn't swing very well.,"I purchased this swing for my baby. She is 6 months now and has pretty much out grown it. It is very loud and doesn't swing very well. It is beautiful though. I love the colors and it has a lot of settings, but I don't think it was worth the money."
1,underperforming,Was disappointed in the swing performance. My daughter borrowed an older FP model that my grandson loves. The starlight model barely swings and inexplicably changs speeds. The timing on the lights does not work well either. I would return this if I had saved the box.
3,Love that it's not too big!,"I really like that it's not too big and does not take a lot of space. My home is small and since having the baby, he's taken over. This fits in the corner nicely. My baby likes the swing and I like that he's comfortably reclined. The stars in the curtain are okay and in general, swings today are cheaply made but...what are you going to do. Overall, it does the job and I got a good price on Amazon."
5,Our little girl loves it!,"This swing is a life-saver! Our little girl really likes it a lot. The option to swing from front to back or side to side is incredible. Sometimes she has a preference and sometimes she doesn't, so we're glad we can accommodate her. The music is actually pretty decent, with good volume controls. Not sure I see a whole lot of difference between the speed settings, but the highest setting is definitely a little faster than the lowest, so that is nice. She really likes the little lights and the mobile (sp?), and gets pretty fixated on them. It's a nice feature. Overall, it was a fantastic purchase."
1,Motor Died within 3mo of Use!,"My fist swing was Fisher Price ""My Little Lamb"" which was battery operated. After the motor died I got a replacement one from Fisher price. This lasted me through kid #1, kid #2 got to use it a couple of months and then the replacement one on my first swing died too. As the first swing was well out of warranty at this point, and a swing is a must, I (shame on me!!!!) decided to punish myself with yet ANOTHER Fisher Price swing. The logic was simple...this one plugs in removing the influx of power supplied to the swing unlike the battery operated one. Well 3mo later and this one has died too! My baby is only 15lbs...never again...never again!"
4,Great but really fast!,"We used this swing with our baby from the first night she came home from the hospital and refused to sleep in the playard bassinet. She must have felt much cosier in the swing because she went right to sleep (even without the motion).i love the nature sounds and the volume control has a good range. My only complaint is that the slowest swing setting is still really fast. It seems slower now that our baby is almost three months, but at 7lbs, it seemed like it might give her whiplash. I have never used it on anything but the slowest speed.Now it is such a life saver and soothes her even in those colicky evening hours. I definitely recommend and would buy again. Thank you, FP!"
4,Great swing! My daughter loves this!,"From the beginning our daughter has loved this swing. She was fussy when we first brought her back from the hospital but she quickly calmed down on this thing.Features/Pros:1) It's adjustable to swing side-to-side or you can rotate it so it swings front-to-back (your child's)2) The mobile has several songs and a convenient reset button (it times out).3) It's easy to take off material for cleaning4) Easy to assembleCons:1) Not sure if it's our unit but the lower settings seem to be the same speed.2) It runs on batteries and does not have an option to plug-in. I modified it using a 6V power supply, but that will obviously void the warranty. Pretty easy modification with about $2-3 in parts.3) The little lambs fall off at times b/c you just hang their strings on clips.Not much more to say about the swing. It works."
5,A must have!,"Love the music, baby loves them. They calms the baby down and put her to sleep.Plug in feature makes it possible to be turned on over night.The mobile comes with it is .... boring for the baby, so I changed them to more colorful stuffed animals and that worked out fine.Baby just started to like the buterfly thing, and she watches it constantly.Overall, very happy with the purchase."
3,It's just OK,"Things which I like about this swing:- Cute design, color, fabric material, power plug-in feature, lighting optionThings which I don't like:- Weak motor (it seems OK now for my little girl, but will NOT be the same when she's older and heavier), the seat doesn't recline enough for the baby to actually sit up (she can hardly reach the toy bar), the butterflies are hung quite high and she can barely see them."
4,A Life and Sleep Saver,"We bought this swing after my daughter was 2 months old and I had suffered with a regular battery swing. The batteries always ran out and the swing motion was just to fast for me. I wanted a plug in swing that also had two different motions and my husband picked this one out.I am SO glad he did. Sometimes my daughter wouldn't sleep in her crib and once she went down in this swing, she was out. Yes the music (on low) is loud, but you don't notice it after awhile.I will say that we keep it in one area and haven't had a problem with the stability of the legs. The mobile and lights will sometimes go out, but I think that is a button issue and not the motor.Would I get this again....in a heartbeat. My daughter is now 7 mo. and is getting to big for this and tries to get out of it all the time. I'm sad to see it go, but I'm glad we had it for as long as we did. Well worth the money!"
1,I had to give this thing a one star. . .,I hate this product. I purchased this swing gleefully! I was sold on all of the bells and whistles! I rushed home and my BIL spent an hour putting it together. This toy totally struck out!Strike one: My BIL placed his tiny underweight 5 month old baby in swing for test ride. While swinging baby lifted her arm to tug at the mobile and the swing nearly fell forward. Never mind the fact that she could reach the mobile!Strike two: The MOTOR IS LOUD! VERY LOUD! My washing machine on the spin cycle is like a fluttering butterfly compared to this BEAST!Strike three: THE Music is very annoying!I returned this blasted thing after one day of use! I exchanged it for the Graco Papasan Swing. I couldn't be happier!
3,Baby loves it but I have to agree with some of the -ve's mentioned by others!,"We got this for our baby girl and first started using it when she was 3 1/2 weeks. She loved it then..in fact it encouraged her first coos as she tried to talk to the butterflies and still loves it now at 9 weeks.I have only given it three stars as I have to agree with some of the points made by other reviewers.1. It makes a loud creaking/grinding noise as it swings2. Even on the lowest setting the swinging is much too vigorous for a newborn...I put it one for a few swings then turn it off.For my child, it is stimulating so I cant use it as a sleep aid.because as soon as I put her in it..she is looking for the lights and butterflies whether we put them on or not.While the colors are quite cutesy and sweet for a girl..(pale pink & green)..I wonder how long it will keep her entertained as she grows. If I had seen it in the shop, I would have gone for a more colorful model myself."
2,Great but......,"My baby loves, loves, loves this swing. We love it because it swings two ways. If he gets fussy swinging one way, we turn him around and swing him the other way.Now, the reason for the two stars: the motor went out... Twice! We purchased the first swing in December 06. In February the motor went out and we had to get another one. Then just today, April 25, 07 the motor conked out AGAIN!We don't even turn on the lights for our baby because they distract him. All he ever does is swing.Someone talked about this item not being sturdy. It doesn't feel sturdy but it is. It has to stand on two legs because you need to turn the swing. We've never had any problems with it breaking down. We only have motor issues.At $159 the motor should not go out. I'd stay away from it.If you can get another model that swings both ways, do that. That's the only feature that is absolutely fantastic about it."
2,"Swing works fine but mobile, lights and music stopped working just after two days","When I ordered this product, I was hoping that my baby girl will enjoy it. I was so excited when my baby likes to spend time in it. This happiness only lasted two days before the mobile, lights, and music stopped working. I am a little bit concerned about the quality of this product. I have to return the swing and consider another type of swing for my baby."
2,Swing quit swinging after four months,"I bought this swing for my sister as a baby shower gift her baby was born November 6,2010 a couple days ago it quit swinging the music still plays and the stars light up so Iam guessing the motor went out on it."
4,Must have,"I like the fact that you can plug this in and not burn batteries like most swings. My son was 7 lbs when he was born and I don't think he was big enough to enjoy the swing until he put on more weight, but now we use it frequently during the day. Its soft and sweet. The music is great and the mobile keeps my son's attention"
3,Disappointed,"Fisher-Price Mocha Butterfly Cradle SwingI have had this swing for under 3 months. it was fantastic, until this past week when the swinging has minimized to barely any movement. I have the ac plugged into the wall, so there is no chance of the batteries being low or dead. when I have the swing facing out, it barely moves, but when it's facing sideways, it swings just fine. I dont understand. but I am highly disappointed. Now I have to go spend money on another swing."
4,Very good product,"After reviewing several similar products, i decided to purchase the Fisher-price Starligt Papasan Cradle Swing.Once received i was very satisfied with the quality of this cradle swing. Its performance, design and features are very nice.My baby boy loves it!"
4,6 months and still going BUT....,"So we have had this swing 6 months. It was going extremely slow and barely moving, so one day I randomly got this idea to take the netting off...now it works like a charm!Not the BEST swing on the market but still works great. The blue color is more lavendar than blue and my daughter loves the star lights, I just wish it stayed on longer."
4,"A good product, but a few design issues.","Overall, this is a good swing. It has lots of nice features. Unfortunately, my daughter didn't like it as well as the used, 3+ year old, normal back and forth Graco that a friend gave me. I suspect it's because the Graco could really get going while this one did not swing nearly fast or hard enough, even when using the electrical outlet. Also, the different between speed 1 and 6 was near imperceptible. Lastly, the buttons need some work. The speed dial is loud and would wake my daughter up, and the music button - you have to cycle through to get it turned off. It's just bad design.Pros:-Lights distracted daughter for 1+ hours-Multiple swing optionsCons:-Loud buttons-No easy ""off"" button for music-Swing speeds need more differentiation-Stronger motor needed"
3,Great at first... doesn't last,"It's worked great through our first 2 children. Lent it to a friend for one of their babies. Then brought it back for our third child: working great at first. Now, the swing mechanism doesn't work anymore. It slowly faded. Planned obsolescence?"
1,DOES NOT SWING - only after 4 days of use the swing stopped working,I bought the swing 6 days ago. Arrived 4 days ago and after only 4 days of use the swing is hardly swinging. The swing has about 6-7 settings for the speed and from day one they all acted exactly the same - SLOW and it got slower and slower over time. Last night I noticed it is so slow it is basically not swinging any more. Also the seat that holds the baby has become lopsided and my baby keeps sliding to one side of the cradle. Returning this ASAP and looking for another Swing.
4,Good swing for the price,I bought this for my micro preemie kiddo. He was about 6 pounds when we first let him swing in it. It worked pretty nicely. A little bit of a knocking noise but nothing that disturbed him. As he got bigger the swing doesn't swing as well. He's about 11 pounds now and it seems like it's working hard to move him. I hope that the motor isn't burning out...Update:Had swing since August. Started using it around October. My baby is 11 pounds 4 ounces now and on the highest setting it moves about an inch to the left and an inch to the right and knocks. Kinda irritated.
4,Good for beginners,"I'm a beginner and this dvd was very helpful. I've been researching all over the internet and reading books, and wasn't really able to comprehend what I needed to do. It's so much easier to understand when you see it being done. The sections she covers are kinda short, and I think a little more should be covered - but I guess that's probably what the next volume would be for. $30 is pretty pricey for what this dvd has - there should have been more to it, or at least come with a bead board or something. I would like to see the next volume, but if it's for this price again I'll pass."
5,undoubtedly compelling,"Simple, poignant and funny. I saw the movie starring Emma Thompson and was moved to read the original play. Highly recommended!"
4,Dealing with Cancer,"I intially looked at this play to see the references to John Donne's poetry, but was swept away by the tight drama of the story of an indomitable English professor courageously coping with cancer - with a dash of w;t. The meaning of the Semi-colon is explained in the play, it becomes a symbol of intellectual rigour, and an attutude of professionalism, either in coping with cancer, or studying English literature.What is also insightful is the portrayal of everyone else around her, how they help, or do not help, either through ignorance and insensitivity, or self-interest. I think for people in academic situations, or in any profession where status is so important, it will show that perhaps admiration is not better compassion when you are on the death bed."
5,Wit,"I myself have terminal Breast Cancer. I felt every emotion she expressed. I watched it on Tv. I have been trying to find out if it was true. It was so real for me. I was sick as I watched it, and at the end as she looked to the audience, when the doctor asked about her pain, I reached out to the TV and held her hand. And the nurse was like myself, I worked as a Nurse, so I felt both actors feelings. I won't forget it."
5,Life with Style,"I was captivated by the synopsis I read and could not wait to read the play.It seems almost heartless to say ""it's a great read"" - vital intelligent woman dying of cancer - but it is! Now I've had the opportunity to see W;t on stage and the power of the written word was brilliantly brought to life by the Ensemble Theatre in Sydney Australia.The character of Vivianne Bearing created by Margaret Edson, exhibits the strengths and weaknesses of real women in the same siutation. The ending is so powerful and reflected for me the death of a loved one, who died with a look of triumph on her face.Read it! See it! This is a play with a long shelf life."
1,I would give it 0 stars if I could,"This play was so full of stereotypes, it is ironic that the title is ""Wit."" The cold, driven, successful English professor gets cancer, her doctors are absolutely inhuman, insensitive jerks (of course), and this makes her realize what a cruel person she has been all her life. It's sooo predictable and obvious that I'm surprised there wasn't a blinking sign telling me when to laugh when I saw it in the theatre. I can NOT believe something so unoriginal won the Pulitzer. The one thing I give the play credit for is the clever dialogue. But the cleverness of the dialogue could never make up for the lack of real people in the play. The stereotypes masquerading as characters made the play shallow in the end and no amount of ""witty"" dialogue could make up for that."
5,"A ""must read"" in the history of computers","This is an important book: it is written at a (reasonably) accessible level for non-specialists, but emphasises the evolution of the ideas involved , rather than emphasising the personalities and the ""gee whizz"" as so many non-technical books do.Some gentle debunking in here too, and some refutations (or clarifications) of popular myths. And lots of material not covered in most histories of the computer."
4,Excellent review of computer development history,"My career in computers started in 1957. This book gives an accurate, interesting review of computer development and the many companies involved. A good read."
3,short sweet spiritual,"this is a short, sweet book on dealing with the anguish of moving - from an Episcopalian slant. If you don't like references to God, don't buy it. Does have links to good sites and bibliography of resources that is helpful."
4,A great book for big picture seekers,"Levers of Control presents a comprehensive theory illustrating how managers control strategy using 4 basic levers: belief systems, boundary systems, diagnostic systems, and interactive control systems (the whole book is based on these 4 levers). Simons shows how these control levers complement each other when used together and how effective top managers use these levers to stimulate and guide the search for strategies in the futures."
4,Solid outline-format review of anatomic pathology,"This is one of several outlines available for purchase in book form covering anatomic pathology. Essentially, what you are purchasing is a nice set of review notes for boards preparation. This multiauthor book like all texts has some chapters that are stronger than others. Some authors (particuarly breast) have let their own classification schemes come out--for better or worse (but a book like this just doesn't have room for lengthy debates on fine points). The chapters ""essentially"" follow Rosai's textbook, and the strongest asset is it's numerous tables. Expensive, but I think it's better than its direct competitors."
2,"Some useful tables, but a very boring read","Billed as a overall review book for anatomic pathology, this book is a snore. I will say there are many chapters with useful summary tables and the information contained is for the most part up to date and accurate. However, the outline format is monotonous and laborious to read, there are no images, there is no index at the end, there are rarely percentages by immunohistochemical stains, and there is no use of bold or italics to highlight what is really important in the text. This book has the overall feeling of an amateur writing team which I suspect most residents and practicing pathologists will not find very useful."
4,Essentials of anatomic pathology,"I am a PGY2 resident in pathology, and this book has proven to be an invaluable addition, it is an excellent review and quick reference book.The only drawback, is that the pictures are black and white and there are some misspellings in the text.I strongly recommend it."
3,too bulky,"This book start our with outline format and good for handy quick review. Now it became a 1800 some page ONE BIG HEAVY book that you can barely carry, not handy at all.It should have just update molecular, cytogenetic and new immunohistochemistry for the entities. why put so many color pictures? especially immunohistochemistry color pictures? and for cytology and forensic, why go so detail to put pictures? Or should just split into two volume book."
4,My son has found a new obsession,"I got this book for my 2 year old at our last trip to the library (my son picked it out himself) and he has not wanted to stop reading it since. We read it at least twice a day and he talks about snowmen all the time. He started asking me to sing Frosty the Snowman, points out the giant blow-up snowmans at the store and tells me all the time about what the snowman was doing in the book (even when we're not reading it). I was a little unsure when I first saw it, since it doesn't have any words. However, that hasn't mattered one whit to my son and I have to say that I don't have any problems just talking about the pictures. This is definitely one that we will be purchasing (since my son will be devastated when we have to return it to the library)."
4,What Happened to Him?,"My sister turned me on to this book and the video one Thanksgiving and it has lived in our hearts ever since. She lives in Alaska and is often very far away from us, even on holidays. The video, in addition to carrying out an artistic style faithful to the book, also has a wonderfully composed soundtrack. The ""Walking in the Air"" sequence has been covered by George Winston and was the opener for the ""Celtic Woman"" set. Yes, the Snowman appears to have melted away at the end, but I think this need not be frightening, as it allows many questions to arise about his final disposition. My mother read to me from Grimms fairy tales which involved stories of orphaned children etc. which I never thought too disturbing."
1,photos are too small,"Being a small, early board book for toddlers, the beautiful story is lost. The photos are too small; The video, which was an adabtation based on the book is one of my family favorites, and I have given the video as a gift six times/ so wonderful story, but not in this small book."
5,The Snowman,"The snowman is a classic. Although I am only 18, I can still remember first seeing the snowman book as a movie also. I was so touched by how the story addresses friendship,changes and differences."
4,not the original storyboard,"This review is for the ""The Snowman (Nifty Lift-and-Look)"". Note that many of the other reviews here seem to be for the original format of ""The Snowman"". This book, while cute and entertaining for my 16 month old who loves any flap book, is not as described. There is nothing wrong with this book but the description is misleading. This book is a group of scenes with the snowman and boy and other family members with various flaps and does not follow the original story."
5,Every Young Family should have this video,This features beautiful animation and music without the clutter of words. It is a magical dream trip to the north pole with the snowman a child made in the front yard. It is less than an hour long so it is a nice video to enjoy while settling the kids in for the night.
2,"BEAUTIFUL BOOK, NO WORDS","This board book is beautiful but displayed in tiny panels, like a Sunday cartoon. Also, it has zero words and is not useful for teaching reading unless a parent is willing to narrate the entire book. Not great choices, a very imperfect product."
4,Magical,"The simplicity of its message, the sweetness of the characters, the emotion of the story, all serve to make THE SNOWMAN a child's fantasy come true. I'd recommend the video first, as the music makes the scenes come alive, but reading the book alone allows for the imagination to take off with the little boy and journey with him through the snowy night. Hopefully this book will become a modern-day children's classic."
5,Use this with high school kids!,"Briggs has perfected the art of the wordless book, and this is a great title to use to teach older kids how to do storyboarding for video or movie-making. Compare the book to the video as a final ""lesson"" and students will see the intricacies of the craft. This newly reissued edition has a ""sparkly"" cover, and is sure to be a favorite for families with kids of all ages, as well."
4,Love this book!,"I bought this for my son because I loved this book when I was a kid. It has no words which is why I think I liked it so much; it lets your mind do the talking. I am giving it a 4 star rating because I thought it was going to be bigger than it really is, it's about 4"" by 3"". Other than that this is just a fun, different book for kids to enjoy!"
3,"Get the ""Complete"" instead...","Even though this disc offers a good introduction to Stokowski's early firey Bach transcriptions for a cheap price, it is a terrible re-mastered sound...sorry to say.If you're serious about getting Stokowski's famous early Bach transciptions, you must get the Pearl edition which offers the complete mono recordings on 2 cd's, in excellent remastered sound! It's desert island material!"
2,Poor recording quality,"Very, very poor recording quality. This CD should have been cleaned up before its release. A huge disapointment to me"
5,that's so raven- disguise the limit,i watched this dvd of this show and i really enjoyed it a lot because it was very funny.the show had a funny sense of humor but it also had good friendly quality between each character in the show.so i would recommend to the fans who used to watch this show to buy this dvd and really enjoy it all over again.sincerly chrisfan.
5,Love it,"Im a big kid at heart, plus someone stoled this DVD from me, so I came on amazon looking for it and you guys had it woo, I was happy, cause kids that I watch loves raven!"
5,Nathan Loves that's so Raven,"That's so Raven-Disguise the limit DVD is like the best DVD ever, i have the first one and i love it so much and i thought there would never be another dvd better then it but i was wrong! this DVD totally rocks, it has four really cool episodes plus a never before-seen episode, i mean how great is that, go Raven from your biggest fan from australia."
2,Boring!,"I cant believe all of these comments in the reviews. Your all so stupid. Its only a tv show and not even very good one.I'm 10 years old and I liked this show when it first started. It was good when it started, it was difrent to the other shows on Disney and it was funny. But now I think all of the Raven storys are the same. Its the same evry week, Raven sees the future and it looks good or bad. Something happens and she tries to change it. Then Raven sees something else happens, so she tries to change it again. This happens a few times in each story and by the end we find out that Raven didnt really know evrything that weas going to happen and it didnt go the way she wanted it to but it all finished happaly for evrybody.Thats why I think the show is boring now. You know whats going to happen evry time. Its boring and Im going to stop waching it."
5,Soooo Cool,I love Disguise the Limit. My favorites are Country Cousins and The Grill Next Door (Stanley is hilarious!). You need to get this. I love Raven's show and I love this DVD. Even my mom likes it. Get this!
5,Love it!,I love thats so raven! its the best disney show i have ever watched! and this dvd is great! buy it and watch it its so great! also check out the thats so raven doll she is really pretty!
5,loved it,Was a gift and she loved it. Our daughterloved everything we have gotten from necalooked better than picture
3,NOT SO GOOD,"ALTHOUGH THE CONTENT IS VERY INTERESTING IT IS PRINTED IN VERY LOW QUALITY PAPERBACK PAPER AND LACKS ALMOST ALL KIND OF SIGNIFICANT ILUSTRATIONS.UNLESS YOU ARE VERY INTERESTED IT LOOKS VERY BORING TO READ ,ALBEIT AT THE END THE CONTENT IS OK"
5,This was money well spent!,"The Panasonic CT-27DC50 TV/DVD is a quality piece of equipment. I just got it a few days ago, and I was impressed by the sharpness of the DVD playback. It takes a while to understand the remote control unit as it has a lot of buttons to learn and the owner's manual is a little vague on descriptions, but the picture itself is great and the quality of the sound is excellent. I, for one, am glad that it ISN'T a flat screen TV, as reflections would be a big problem. I have no hesitation to recommend this one."
5,a great buy,"I just got this TV/DVD combo today.... With tax, it came to $... I got it home and all I had to do was plug it in, connect the cable and turn into the human couch potato. Max time of installation was 15 minutes, including lugging the 80 lb. machine up two flights of stairs! No fussing with different cables and cords...which is nice if you're like me (not a techno-nerd).This is my first DVD player, but it seems relatively easy to use. The remote is handy, with all the buttons where they seem they should be.The TV picture is clear and the sound is okay.I was debating between buying this TV/DVD or the Toshiba flat-screen 20"", which was $..cheaper. The Panasonic won out, though, because I thought the additional 7 inches of viewing was worth it.Overall, I would recommend this TV/DVD combo for someone who is too busy to worry about cords and connection cables. It is a great first-venture into the DVD world."
5,Excellent Service/Product,Very happy with the service received from Amazon. Fast delivery and excellent service overal. The product works great. I am very happy with the purchase of this product.
1,Not So Thrilled,"The tiny USB connector snapped off after a few uses, it bent when I set camera down and then just weakened from there. I am getting one of the angled USB connector models and suspect that will resolve that issue..."
4,Great for reducing camera movement,I like that I can take the pictures without causing camera shake. There have been times that I hit the button and the remote doesn't seem to respond promptly on the D80 when I had it. I haven't tried this remote on my D7000. I am hoping it can be used as well. One complaint which is not specific to Nikon but rather to any one with a cord is that the cord gets in the way when it's hanging permanently on the cameras and isn't always easily reached quickly when a picture opportunity arises. A wireless will probably be my next purchase.
5,Very much needed...,If you are going to do any type of shooting from a tripod then this is a must have. Simple to connect easy to use.
4,It works well enough,"It is, as several have mentioned, difficult to plug into the camera all the way. It is a tiny, awkward connection that requires nimble fingers. Also, it is too easy to slide the shutter lock inadvertently. With either the connection or lock even invisibly out of place, the unit will not work.However, once all is snug, it works perfectly.It would be nice if the Nikon remotes were a little more generic, and fit more than a couple of models."
5,I can't believe I waited so long to get this......,"Just thinking about all the wasted time and missed shots because I didn't have this before is a little depressing. Especially given how cheap this is, I don't know why I waited so long to get it. Quite simply, if you do any tripod photography this is an absolute must. If you are doing low-light still life, night shots, or any shooting that requires a long exposure time then I really don't see any reason not to get this. What did I do before getting this? Set the timer each time and waited around for it to go through it's beeping spiel before finally snapping the picture. With this item, it's instantaneous. Just snap away!By the way: I am shooting with a D80. This works with the D80, despite the little information out there to that effect."
3,Not all that fun,This Powerpuff Girls game is not like the episodes.All you do is go around collecting girly stuff and the same thing.And you get lost in the Bonsai Garden level.And the people and the villains are so easy to beat all it takes is ten hits out of all the villians and 2 hits out the same ones you fight in every level.When i first heard of this game I thought it was going to be fun.But no this game is not very fun.And all three of the games on Gameboy color are all the same and the same levels in each one just different orders.I think this game is not very fun
1,"Bad Mojo Jojo, Indeed","I got this game for Christmas 2000 and was quickly disappointed. I don't demand great graphics from a GBC game, but this one's graphics aren't even marginally good. What's the point of playing a Powerpuff Girls game when the characters are barely even recognizable?Gameplay stinks, too. The characters' attacks are monotonous, and the game consists entirely of exploring flat, side-scrolling locations and beating up bad guys. You're also supposed to pick up items along the way, but those are mostly pointless.I'm a diehard Powerpuff fan, but I can't recommend this game. It's too bad -- the Powerpuff Girls are among the few GBC games that would have strong appeal to young girls, and the designers disrespect them with this crummy game."
3,Pretty Good,"The Powerpuff Girls: Bad Mojo Jojo is a pretty good game. I got it for Christmas but can't beat it. I have no idea where to find the secret codes. If you think graphics is the best thing for a game to have, DO NOT buy the game. It is ok, but the graphics are a little iffy. Don't buy the game if you have never tested it, played it at a friend's house, etc. Try it out before you buy, and you may end up taking the game back anyway."
4,Great!,"I naturally traded for this game with my friend, giving up Bomberman Pocket. The game's great, I love to see Blossom fly around and I love to control her. My favorite is Buttercup, so I'm planning on getting that cartrige someday. But I can't figure out what to do! The game didn't come with an instruction booklet when traded, so I had to learn on my own. See, it says I have 20% of the game done, but WHAT DO I DO NEXT??!! If anyone knows, please e-mail me at SailorMoonD@webtv.net and let me know. But as far as I know, this game is COOL!"
2,Not that good and doesn't capture the spirit of the PpGs,"This game isn't terrible, but neither is it very good. The levels are too big. Normally, that is not bad, but in this game each level looks so much alike one simply can't tell where one has been in the level. That means you keep Blossom going in circles, while in the real world you are thinking, ""Have I gone through here yet. I have, havn't I?"". The other problem is the spirit of the game itself. In Bad Mojo Jojo you have very limited flying power, limited laser eye beams, and you can be killed simply from landing in a pool of water. In the cartoon the Powerpuffs knock down buildings and kick major villain booty. Oh well, while the backgrounds were extremely repetitive the characters looked good. All in all, this game is only for fans of the show."
3,Fine for a 6 year old,This is fine for a six old but is a bit repetitive in play mode. The ranking system would be discouraging for an older player that realizes 60% is not a good score. One other comment about a previous review: How could the first reviewer listed have all three(all three powerpuff girls) of the products if Bubbles isn't released as of this date ? Keep on your toes when you trust reviews.
1,Disappointed!,"This game was a big disappointment! We had gotten all three for Christmas and played for about half-hour. Our 9 year old is a HUGE fan (as my wife and I). All the levels(or ""rooms"") look alike and were pretty confusing at first. All three games could have easily fit on one cart. I hope Cartoon Network puts more thought on their games! What a big marketing sham.. Nonetheless, we will still continue to be fans of the show and other merchandise."
5,One of the best!,"This book is so great. I read it when I was in the 5th grade. I am 29 years old now. I have a copy of the book and still read it. The story of a girl who finds magic in an old bookstore, in an alley is so much fun. The experiences she has and what she learns is valuable for anyone at any age. Who wouldn't want to have magic at their fingertips at somepoint. A very touching story about friendship that always brings a tear to my eye."
4,WWII: Illustrated,"Taylor's is a reasonably good book, lucid, witty. I read it cover to cover the day before my final High School History exam, it gave me a decent overview of the war, its causes, practices and effects. 'Illustrated' is somewhat a misnomer...there's maybe a picture every second page, but otherwise, I recommend this book."
2,"Useful information, poor presentation","The information was useful & approprate to the topic. I'd rank it as an average quality refence but a very poor text book.The text is poorly written. The code is simple and easy to understand, but not very object oriented. There is not enough explanation of the code. The code is not electronically available.The treatment was very mathematical but lacking in explanation & application examples. There were plenty of deffinitions, but not enough examples."
4,explains many key ideas,"Here is a text of advanced nonlinear dynamics. Geared towards the intensive use of computers to perform the necessary grungework. Steeb hits on many important ideas that have emerged in recent decades. He shows the interrelation between chaotic phenomena and fractals, and how fractals can be used to describe the onset to chaos.The Hidden Markov Models have proved to be the key idea in current Automatic Speech Recognisers. A tribute to the practical nature of this idea.Steeb's discussion of neural networks and genetic algorithms is enough to get you started in this field. Ideas like forward and back propagation for feedback are clearly explained.The sample code should be welcomed. It lets you see for yourself on your own computer, and to tinker with the various parameters. Though I am unsure about the choice of code in Symbolic C++. Unlike C++ or Java, this is a rarely used language."
4,Cold but beautiful,Pessoa shows us life as it is when we've completely lost interest in it. Nice to know someone else feels the same and can see the beauty in that.
3,try zenith instead,"I find the Richard Zenith translation to be much more lush and lyrical than Margaret Jull Costa's:The Book of Disquiet (Penguin Classics)That being said, translation is an art of interpretation; this has some of the same syntactical constructions found in her Saramgo work (excellent, by the way) that don't work quite as well with Pessoa lexical peculiarities."
2,can see reflections,"I've had this product for one day.I sit with a window behind me. When I have the anti-glare screen on, I can see the reflection from the windows; when I have it off, I don't. So that's bothersome.This filter is too small for my monitor. I have a 18"" LCD, and it fits just barely so I can't see the edges of my monitor, which is annoying because my toolbar is at the bottom and I can only see half of it. Whatever anti-glare screen you buy, I recommend going one size up so you don't have this effect. (It'll look ugly, but it'll work.)Also, the ground cable is conveniently located right where my power button for the monitor is. This means, if I touch or slightly adjust the screen, my monitor turns off."
5,Complete!,"This program has the most documents in one place than I have ever seen.I bought this version as an resource for my personal Bible Study time, and for more information to raise my family. The software was easy to use, and the support staff was very friendly. No matter was you wanted to know about the Bible, or what version you wanted in, this has it. Maybe you want to organize a prayer list, or keep a journal, or read a daily verse, it has all that too."
4,A variety of information,"I liked this book because it covers a variety of Struts-related topics - it's not just a ""Struts and only Struts"" cookbook. It mixes in a little Struts + database related stuff (Hibernate, MySQL), a little Struts + XML, a little Struts + JSTL, a little Struts + JWebUnit, and so on. While I wouldn't suggest getting this book if you want to learn everything there is to know about hooking Struts up with Hibernate (for example), it does give you a pretty nice overview of a variety of things you might want to integrate/use with your Struts application.The book's assumption is you have some experience with Struts, Tomcat (or other servlet container), JSPs and Java. If you're not comfortable with any of those I'd recommend getting familiar with those first. Other than that, this is a nice book with plenty of examples to increase your Struts knowledge - whatever your current level may be."
5,Great Book even for a newbie!,I am a Struts newbie and have been working with Struts for only two weeks yet the Jakarta Struts Cookbook helped me build a Wizard-Style page Flow application (pages 199 to 203 in the book). Without this book I would have been totally lost and probebly very frustrated. One thing I really liked is that the author chose to use the LookupDispatchAction rather than having an Action for each step in a wizard-style application.As I look through the book I can see there are very insightful and intuitive recipe's for dealing with future projects like pages 90 to 95 on how to Handle Date Input Fields.Even if you are a Struts newbie this book will help you figure out how to do specific advanced tasks. If you are looking for quick information to add to your projects then this book is a great buy.
4,Great reference to expand usage of Struts,"I was very pleased with the examples in the book and the ability to apply them to everyday struts problems. The upgrading sections were particularly useful in my case, but I have found uses for many other of the recipes in this book.There were some examples that required a bit more research on my part, but the author was very helpful and responsive when a question did arise concerning a recipe.This book is a great companion for any Struts Application Developer."
4,Southwest Bell 900MHZ Cordless Phone,"Attractive and well-made phone-some of the features are integrated telephone answering device,call waiting,caller ID,speakerphone, conversation record,voice memo, easy to understand directions...The features on the base are readable and the handset fits perfectly in palm of hand. It was very easy to program and the directions are clear. The handset also stands by itself anywhere."
2,I do not like this phone,"The readout on the handset is very small, and difficult to read the caller id feature. Also, there is no dial pad on the base unit that hinders the use of the speakerphone. When accessing the machine from a remote location, there are no voice prompts to lead you through the options. I would not buy this phone."
3,The May Fourth Movement,"This book has very interesting points, owever lacks the importance of why this movement began in the first case. It has historical facts and roles it had in China, but lacks of how it ties in with Communism, one of the most important events that lead to communism in China"
5,This book is soooooooooooooo AWESOME! I loved it!,This book is SOOOOO good! I enjoyed it so much that I could barely put it down! Let's just say I barely got any sleep a couple nights because I refused to stop! lol You will love this book!
2,A Weak Perspective of the Facts,"The author writes nonsense when he asserts that the U.S. by its presence is responsible as an inhibiter to reunification. Removal of U.S. forces would only serve to tempt the DPRK to achieve unification by force. The Kim regime is in deep fear of philosophical contamination from the capitalist societies beyond it border because they maintain their power by use of absolute control. It has nothing to do with ROK alliances with the West. The prospective reader would do better than read a source written by a left wing reporter from the Washington Post by reading Victor Cha's ""The Impossible State"", a man who's made understanding North Korea his life's work."
3,"Good intentions, but misses the mark","This books tries hard to approach atheism from a new perspective, and at first it's refreshing. But after a while, it just doesn't go anywhere. The metaphors and analogies are vague and overly theoretical, and Harbour's sentence structure can get rambling and confusing at times. This is intended to be a beginner's guide, but ""What Is Atheism?"" by Douglas E. Krueger does a far better job of outlining the arguments in a clear and concise way."
5,Good Home Eatin',I had this book for over 10 years and used it so much I had to order another one to start cooking some more. This book has some really great recipes in it and after making them once or twice you can doctor them up and make each recipe your own. It possesses a lot of useful info for the new and experienced cook and you will really love some of the recipes included.
5,was looking for this particular cookbook for myself .,"Wanted this cookbook for myself as it's got many of the items that we grew up eating. Gave the other to my older sister for her to give to her adult single son, who enjoys cooking and has proven to e a big help to him and her so now she isn't always receivingphone calls for bail outs for cooking, now calls just to keep in touch."
3,Pictures ?,"I ordered this book from Barnes & Noble based on the mouth watering receipes, fetured in Ebony Magazine. I was very disappointed however to find no pictures, that is meat of a cookbook! I kept it anyways, I'm Just not enthused and almost sent it back."
2,too old,Im a new cooker and this book isnt for newbies. Too hard to understand and very old recipes.
3,Could have been a worse!,"I purchased the Ebony Cookbook after I had seen a copy at a friends. The book was used but stated that it was in good condition. Book arrived with multiple pages missing all through the book. I called Amazon, they contacted the vendor and said the vendor would contact me within 3 days. I heard back from the vendor the next day and they issued a full refund incl. shipping as they didn't have another copy and told me to keep the book. As there were so many recipes missing, I just threw the book away. Amazon followed through with me 3 days later to insure that I was satisfied. I have bought a number of things on Amazon and their customer service is great. I was disapointed that the purchase of the Ebony Cookbook did not work out."
2,Underwelmed,"I recently purchased a pair of these gloves at my local hardware store. When I first saw them I was rather impressed, they were; light weight, looked and felt breathable, and looked as if I wouldn't lose any dexterity. So far at first glance they passed my criteria.After about 3 weeks of very light use they started to come unstitched. The most abuse these gloves got was when I was using my chain saw to cut up some tree limbs that fell in my front yard and then picking up and moving the wood to my wood pile. After doing, what I thought was, a very minor activity is when I noticed the thumb starting to come unstitched. I was very disappointed.I will not purchase these particular gloves again. I was would say the longevity of these gloves are not up to par for my line of work."
2,Spend a few dollars more,"No CD memory. Every time you turn it on it starts at beginning.No AM/FM presets. Manual analog tuning. Tuning dial easy to bump.Clock memory lost when batteries replaced.Battery compartment inside, under CD.The CD plays well and the anti-skip is effective."
1,This book [was bad]!,"I don't know what Kluver and Powers were thinking, but it was obvious that they have never even VISITED china, or spent any time around real Chinese people. If they have been to China, it only shows that they are totally ignorant of the topic at hand. This book is another in a long line by small minded, western biased, anglo-loving nerds. In addition to that, there were numerous typos and errors in the book. Too many to begin to list here, but page 116 contained one of the BIGGEST blunders I have ever seen. Unless a professor forces you to buy this book, stay far, far away from it, because you can learn more about this topic on MTV than in this book."
1,20 minutes shorter than 2-record vinyl release.,"Apparently they wanted to keep it down to one compact disc, so they axed a whole twenty minutes from the concert. I would've expected more from Leo,a terrific British label that also puts out Anthony Braxton, Sun Ra and Art Ensemble of Chicago as well as top-notch improvised music from Britain, Europe and Russia. If they don't do it right, who will? Given the sales appeal of CT, I guess we will never have the real Live in Bologna concert on CD."
5,Hellrasier chatterer series 1 neca,This figure is awesome I really like the hellrasier movies and this guy always scared my brother so I had to buy it and it is great it has awesome detail and comes with some cool weapon like in the movies so if a fan or collector you have to have this figure if don't buy it you will be sorry lol
1,Don't know what the others thought,"I bought this book for somebody else and THANK GOD! i didnt buy it for my self. The book contains NO inspirational designs/concepts, beats me how they came up with the title there are certainly NO Outstanding bars/restaurants, NONE WHAT SO EVER!"
2,Where is everybody?,"Why isn't moe. on here? Why isn't Particle on here? Why isn't Sound Tribe Sector Nine here? How about Garage-A-Trois? How about the Super Jam?Why would they choose the Dead's most overplayed and annoying song. I mean, they played a great show and the song that is chosen, was the absolute low point of the show.I was hugely disappointed for their exclusion of what I thought were the highlights of the 2003 festival. The DVD isn't much better in its track selection either.The music on this set is good, but it is a weak sampling of the highlights of the Bonnaroo weekend. To me, a very disappointing effort."
2,Could have been better!,"Being at Bonnaroo 2003 was nothing sort of awsome! Best festival of the year! It is too bad this 2 cd set doesnt do the festival justice. It seems like they only picked artists that would help them sell the cd better to people who werent there. Artist like James Brown, Jack Johnson, Jason Mraz and Ben Harper are very weak compared to some they skiped such as Moe., Neil Young, North Mississippi Allstars, Spearhead, and The Wailers. Also A lot of the songs they picked are not the best from each artists shows, like The Dead's Sugar Magnolia and Widespread Panic's Papa Johnny Road. my advice is dont buy this cd you will not be happy with it, if you are into jamband music your better off trading for live shows from the weekend."
4,One of the better HITLER biographies,"Although none of the American or British authors has succeeded in giving an un-biased and fully factual account of Hitler's fascinating life, Toland's biography is one of the better ones. It is full of facts and reads very smoothly, almost like a novel. Nevertheless, Werner Maser's (updated German) biography is by far the best. Taking into account, however, the difficulties I've had tracking Maser down in the USA, and considering all your other options, this book is one of the best you are going to get, fellow history lovers. You may have to settle for that. As is the case with ALL works regarding HITLER, this biography contains several ""half-truths"" and heresay, so don't take everything as FACT. (But then, that advice applies to all printed material.) Still, Toland's work is a good read."
2,PIA,"I am afraid I have to disagree with all these sparkling reviews. As a huge fan of Toland, I found ""Adolf Hitler"" to be disappointing and one of his poorer efforts. I found it ponderous and difficult to read. I do not recommend it."
4,chale,"the book adolf hitler:the definitive biography,tells what really went on Hitler'd mind in his reasons for the acts that he commited.The book also lets the reader know his struggle from child abuse,his reject from the art school,and the time he had spent in prison were he wrote his book MIEN KAMPF.His rise to power and the success he had on almost conquering all of europe and his fall that lead him to suicide."
5,"Best biograpy on Hitler, bar none","I had the opportunity of corresponding and meeting John Toland when I was a teenager and he was a remarkable man and a great writer. This is by far the best and most readable biography ever written on Hitler. Toland eschews, thankfully, the ridiculous psycho-babble which ruins many other major Hitler biographies.Toland interviewed over 300 people close to Hitler: Tradul Junge, his secretary, Max Wunsche and Richard Schultze, his adjutants, Eva Braun's best friend and many others. He went to the source and his oral interviews constitute a tremendous historical resource.Toland shows that Hitler was sexually normal, which is important since Hitler's supposed ""deviant sexuality"" is the lynchpin of many inferior books.If you are to read one book about Adolf Hitler, make it this one. Nothing better has come down the pike in the 25 years since this books publication. For anyone interested in the history of the 20th century and World War II, this is a must read."
1,NOT RECOMMENDED,"I AM A STUDENT OF HISTORY. I LIKE IT. I READ THIS WAS THE DEFINITIVE HITLER BIO. JUDGING IT BY HOW MUCH I ENJOYED READING IT AND WHAT I LEARNED FROM IT, ONE STAR. I HAD TO FORCE MYSELF TO FINISH IT. IT WAS TOO LONG, BORING AND VERY HEARD TO UNDERSTAND. FORGET IT."
2,badly written and bias,"Although the book is chronologically correct, the writer is very weak in presenting his reasearch and trying to disguise his bias. He claims, and so do most people that read the book, to be only stating the facts and not trying to express his own moral judgement. He does nothing but obviously manipulate the writing in order to express his own opinions, makes judgements of key figures throughout the book and often goes off into side stories that are both irrelevant and impossible to be proven factual. It is an unfortunate fact that books writen about Hitler or WWII will always be in such format. I would like to find one that truely states the facts without irrelevant emotional judgement and derogatory blabber."
5,Compelling reading,I started to read up on Hitler for insights on what happened in his childhood to shape him into the monster he became. TOland's book answered that quesiton in spades. Not only was it extremely readable--I found it compelling. One thing that makes it so is--excellent writing--along with interesting facts. Hitler was not a house painter--he painted postcards and sold them--the postcards could be of houses. It was these kinds of clarified facts that illustrate that Toland was a careful and unique researcher--instead of retreading the bad research of other historians--Toland assumed nothing and went to sources (new and old)--and does seem a final word on the topic of Hitler. Nothing specious in this book.Highly recommended for the scholar and the novice. Both with get much out of this book.
3,A Rather Admiring Account,"Having read much about Hitler and Nazi Germany, I must admit this is one of the more flattering biographies of the man ever written. While, the sheer volume of the work, as well as it's rare photographs are impressive, one cannot help but walk away from this tome with the impression that Toland genuinely admired Hitler. For some insightful criticism of Toland's approach, including debunking of some of his ""facts"", read Lukac's ""The Hitler of History"""
5,Fit the Bill,"I was looking for one larger volume dealing exclusively with the Battle of Bentonville, and this work more than fit the bill. There really isn't that much available on the battle in a single work, but I found that the author was more than up to the challenge, and feel no need to look further."
5,Excellent Book!,Excellent book if you really want to know what drugs do to brain chemistry. I am just starting out researching this topic and I found this book to be extremely helpful and well written. Recommend it highly!
5,Very informative,I got a lot of good information for myself and to share with my colleagues and clients. Valuable to those in the substance abuse counseling field.
5,Great for the health class,Always looking for more books to add to our reading resources for students at the school.This books appears to be a hit.
3,Informative and interesting: but beware...,"I enjoyed this book, it was quite informative, and I learned a lot from it. This book does a good job of giving you the straight up facts in a way that even college students such as myself can understand. It has the appearance of giving everything a fair outlook without any bias, telling you exactly what drugs do to your brain and body, the differences between the drugs, and etc.A word of warning, though. This book speaks only of physical harm and what drugs can do and does not give as much enlightenment on the danger of mental and emotional harm of different drugs. Even if certain drugs don't have any physical dangers from overdose or withdrawal doesn't mean they aren't dangerous and it certainly doesn't make them healthy.That being said, this was a good book and was very clear. I'd definitely recommend it to someone who doesn't know much about drugs and wants to enlighten themselves on the basic knowledge behind each of the different kinds."
3,Pretty good,"It's not a bad book. It goes drug-by-drug and talks a lot about each drug type. Marijuana, Alcohol, ect.. are all covered here. However, I found the writing style a little dry, and I felt like something was lacking when I finished this book. I don't feel like I delved deep enough into any particular drug and it's brain interactions to really be excited. I suppose it wasn't in-depth enough for me."
1,"A good try, but contains misinformation","This book is a decent reference, but gets all the facts wrong concerning GHB. ""Buzzed"" vehemently insists that GHB is toxic, apparently oblivious to the many scientific papers written on this dietary supplement during its thirty plus-year history describing it as a remarkably safe pharmacological agent. See Ward Dean's excellent book ""GHB: The Natural Mood Enhancer"" for the facts. It's a shame, because ""Buzzed"" endeavors to provide a rational alternative to the demonization of drugs in our society. This is a noble goal, and a practical one as well. Too bad the authors didn't do their research."
1,TERRIBLE!!!!!!!!!!!!! One of the WORST reads of my life!,"I bought this book reading that it is UNBIASED.... they then go to explain that ""They want to educate people so people will make THEIR own decision... to say NO to drugs"". That's BIASED!I took a highlighter and highlighted everything in the book that I found that I felt was biased, or any sentence that they themselves would say.... ""well we really don't know""..... My whole book looks yellow.About as knowledgeable as you'd expect ANY non-drug user to be on the subject of drugs.How bout' these sobrietists start writing things they know about....Cuz, Drugs...... they don't know.Utterly Useless, waste of ...... everything.... DON'T BUY THIS BOOK!"
5,wonderful book,I had this book along with chemical dependency for graduate drug class. I have used this book in my psychology and law enforcement professions and find it to be very easy to use and very informative. Great for those who want an easy read.
3,You can buy better,"the Psychedelics Encyclopedia is so much better than this book, even though this book covers psychoactive substances other than Psychedelics, I find drug war propoganda in here. But what are they charging like ($) so in that case i suppose you might as well buy this."
5,"Buzzed: The Straight Facts about the Most Used and Abused Drugs from Alcohol to Ecstasy, Fully Revised and Updated Second Editio","great condition, recived very fast in mail"
4,incomplete drug dictionary,"though the people who have written this book have obviously done their homework and it is refreshing that they give you the facts rather that the 'just-say-no-dont-learn-just-do-what-we-say' propaganda, the claim that they are unbiased is somewhat decietful. most of the facts that are given about drugs are about their negative effects on the body, though this is helpful it still sends the message that drugs are simply bad for you no matter what without actually saying that."
4,Good Information!,"Got this book as a gift for my sister, she really found it to be very informative and interesting. It has a section of color photos of different types of drugs, and in depth looks at what they all do to you.If you know someone who uses and want a friendly way to tell them it might not be the best idea, this is a great book!My sisters friend was looking at it too and said he had learned so much in just the 10 minutes he had looked at it!"
1,Hosed In Houston,"If you enjoyed Hey You and Unleashed Live (both strongly recommended)- it's likely that you will NOT enjoy this album. Electric is thrashy at the best of times and extremely reminscent of a bad garage band at the worst of times.I am so disappointed with Electric that I have considered sending the album back to Jack several times. Like Charlie R. before him, Jack has taken a turn away from his Texas roots down a very unattractive path. It is unclear whether this down turn is a need for artistic expression or simply the wrong people whispering in Jack's ear. Either way - it's a (darn) shame to see such talent go to waste."
3,Suspend your beliefs,"I bought this book because it was required for a class and the professor felt that this author is an up and coming one in the field of theology. That having been said, this book is written in a way where you have to suspend all your previous beliefs and enter into the world of the writer. As such, he has some interesting points to make, however, there are many places where he has clear ""flights of fancy."" Don't expect this book to confirm traditional biblical teaching or create rational argument for new ideas. This is part philosophy and part fantasy in its presentation."
2,"Good ideas, bad execution.",Though many of the ideas are good (some are downright profound) the lyrics and the songs leave a lot to be desired. The jokes are infantile and not at all clever.
4,Good stuff,"A good quick read. Seems to be based on the TV episode, so it stays largely with what you would see if you watched the show rather than presenting the reader with what is happening inside the character's heads. An entertaining story and I could picture the cheesy (but fun to watch) special effects of the TV show while reading it :)The Doctor saves the world (of course) and possibly the entire galaxy/universe from an evil intelligence that uses yetis and a (very) old monk as its weapons. You have to wonder why such a great intelligence cannot come up with a better plan during the 300 years it is working on this one. I guess that's what leads to its downfall, as the Doctor's more spontaneous unplanned actions triumph over the methodically executed evil one's plan."
5,Great water saver,This soaking hose really does the job. It saves water (little or no evaporation) and lets the water soak into the ground. Great purchase; will pay for itself fast.
1,Short life..save your money,"This worked well for about a week. After that it sprouted several ""leaks"" over the length of the hose. It no longer ""weeps"" over the full length of the hose. It only sprays from about 4 holes. Worthless item. Freight charges too high to send it back or I would."
1,terrible soaker hose,"this soaker hose is terrible. the second time I used it, it kinked as hoses do. Except this hose tore right in to two pieces before I could unkink it. I have had a different brand soaker hose for 15 years and it never has done this. This is a cheaply made product. I recommend it to no one. I want my money back from Amazon."
2,Get what you pay for...,Pretty much what my title says. This product is cheap and it is made that way also. I purchased two of these and one works well enough. It does weep more than what my others do but it will do. The other one though broke in half. My next purchase for a soaker hose will not be this brand.
1,Hose's are junk and fall appart when you unwind them.,"I ordered 2 of these Gilmour Water Weeper Hoses 5/8"" x 50' #27-58050 from Amazon. As soon as the wife and I tried to unwind these hoses around are house and in the flower beds they broke in two. We took are time carefully unwinding the hoses first, and then stringing them into position. Nope not in one spot in multiple spots, had to purchase some splicer pieces from hardware to repair them. I went to Walmart the next day and bought 4 new hoses for $8.00 each, and they worked great. I am about done buying off of the internet, everyone seems to want to sell junk and not provide any customer service."
5,"Very interesting, learned a lot and enjoyed it",One of the best brief history books I have read. It covered the interesting parts of these great innovators lives without dragging you into the minutia. Well worth the read.
5,Fascinating History!,An excellent source of info on how America ingenuity changed America and the planet from early days until now. The section on Bank of America's founder as well as the article on the invention of Levis make history come alive. None of the chapters are boring.Recommended for all ages.
1,Better Off with Wikipedia...,"This book is interesting, but didn't really do a great job of capturing my interest. It's similar to reading Wikipedia, but less convenient."
1,I haven't read it and I wont!,I just watched Sir Harold Evans pushing his book. He talked extensively about Thomas Edison electrifying america. Edison did not do it and could not do it with his direct current. Nikola Tesla electrified america with alternating current. Evans is full of it.
1,Glaring errors,"This book has glaring errors in the chapter regarding Dr. Gary Kildall and CP/M. The author trashes DOS as a ""slapdash clone"" and a ""rip-off"" of CP/M, which is simply untrue. Tim Paterson, the author of DOS, is in fact suing the publisher and the author over numerous misrepresentations in the book. Save your money and get a book that is better researched."
1,YUCKY!!!!!,What a HORRIBLE book. It wasn't funny at all. Makes you wonder how some people get published. Sneeble.
2,"Loved my old hoover, not so sure on this one","First, the good news. For the first few months, this thing was awesome. Only complaint is that you have to clean it every time you use it and the seal around the dust cup is not very good.Now the bad. Like everyone else says, the Hepa filter is a major issue. The thing totally clogs up with dirt, stops spinning, and then the gears strip on it. Once that's done, its off to the repair shop. Three months and the unit is no good. The HEPA filter does NOT self-clean. Ok, the big parts fall out, but pet hair and fine dust plug this thing up fast and hard. You'll be amazed at the amount of dirt stuck in this thing if you try to clean it out yourself.Its a great vacuum for a couple months, then its worthless."
5,best functioning vacuum cleaner,i recently purchased a Hoover U8371-900 Windtunnel 2 Complete Bagless Upright & I am so impressed with it's performance & versatility. I had no problem assembling the vacuum cleaner. it feels a little heavy but so far hasn't been a problem for me b/c it has a convenient handle for carrying the vacuum upstairs. I can't believe the suction this vacuum has. it picks up so much more than my previous vacuums & it's so easy to empty out the bagless container. the self-cleaning filter so far has worked with no problems. the tools that come with this vacuum work very well. i am able to vacuum my stairs with the extension hose & the pet hair attachment works well at picking up my dog's hair off of the sofa. overall completely satisfied with this product. kind of embarrassed at how much dirt this vacuum picked up the first time i used it. couldn't believe i had so much in my carpets!
1,Horrible Investment,We bought this vaccuum instead of a Dyson because it was cheaper and seemed to have all the same stuff. Not the case!!! Needless to say after about two months we went out and bought a Dyson. Great improvement!!! The hepa filter clogged after about the second time we used it and you cannot replace them. No comment from Hoover when we e-mailed them about this awful machine!!! We would rate this less than 1 if there was an option to do that.
1,Hate this vacuum,"Although it sucks well and mine is still functioning ok after 2.5 years, it is disgusting and messy to empty, dust/dirt gets everywhere including all over the vacuum. It is also extremely heavy, especially if you have stairs. Do not buy this vacuum."
4,So Far No Problems,Bought this Vaccum to Replace a Hoover WindTunnel V2 with the two Counter-rotating Brushes. It Died after one too many incidents w/rug Fringe. It was also VERY hard to push.. Everything on this Vaccum works as designed after 3 months of use 2-3 times a week. The noise the HEPA filter makes is a little diffrent and takes some getting used to. Switching from Tile to Carpet is very easy with the Electric Height Adjustment Knob. The only reason it doesn't get 5 stars is because I would like it to be easy to take out and thoroughly clean or replace the HEPA Filter.
1,DONT BUY A HOOVER,"Don't buy. Just spent 2 hours trying to find the plugs. Sure enough it is the non-serviceable Hepa ""so called"" self cleaning filter. Appears the gear box that drives the HEPA filter sheared. Now clear but won't turn and ""Self clean"". I'm an engineer, and the engineer who designed this should be ashamed. DONT BUY A HOOVER. This was the second problem - first was the circuit board. Shop had seen a lot of that problem too. Couldn't keep the parts in stock!!!!!"
1,Unacceptable,"The quality of this product is so low that I can't believe it is being sold in the United States during my lifetime.First, it works GREAT until it starts getting into some dirt, hair, etc. (about one or two house cleanings) then the ""self cleaning hepa filter"" will stop turning. If you didn't notice it turning the first time you used it - you might not even realize that when it stops - the vacuum works less well everytime you use it until it stops working completely!It's the worst vacuum I've ever used and I've used many! I rarely write a review on here but I can't stand the thought of another human being having to endure the pain (mental and emotional) that this goofy vacuum has caused me and my wife. This was an expensive vacuum for us and a lousy puchase.Like many of the other people who have written reviews - I'll never buy a Hoover again!Run from this vacuum (not even worth $25)! Don't fall for this one at any price - it will only cause you pain."
1,HEPA filter failure,"have owned this model for about 2 months and it is the first vacuum cleaner that I have ever had, that I have to vacuum each time we use it! The HEPA filter exit chute started clogging from day one and eventually the filter stopped rotating. We also had an earlier self propelled model U6630-900 that worked well, although the accessory hose stopped working some time ago. This is the last Hoover we'll ever buy..."
4,Works for me :),"I got this vacuum because of the extended hose and the wood floor/carpet adjustments. I love the cleaning power. I have 1900 sq ft home and it has NEVER clogged on me. Cleaning the canister is a breeze and I've not had any of the problems everyone else complains about. Maybe I got the one good one in the lot :) My only complaint is that it is heavy but it wasn't rocket science to figure that out when I was at the store and tested the vacuum out. Considering the amazing suction power I'd say the weight is necessary to balance everything out. I've been able to clean my wood floors and carpet easily, I love that I no longer have to hunch over to use the hose attachement as I did with my previous vacuum, and I'm able to clean under the bed and the ceiling corners with esae. And I love that I don't have to buy bags anymore!! :)"
1,This vacuum makes me mental!!,"I'm so glad to see that I'm not the only person who has had issues with this terrible vacuum cleaner. Every time I use it, I immediately get into a foul mood and am ready to scream at anyone in my path. The vacuum itself does pick up quite a bit of dirt and hair, however it's extremely bulky and heavy and cannot be used efficiently on the staircase. I thought that my vacuum was defective when I saw that the Hepa filter became a discusting mess after a few months, however it is apparent that this has happened to everyone who has this vacuum cleaner. I have to use another vacuum cleaner to suck out the dirt from the Hepa filter in order for the vacuum to continue to work. Also, the hand held hose has absolutely NO suction strength and I end up using another vacumm cleaner hose to clean (my old Sharp vacuum that has amazing suction strength). This is an absolute lemon of a vacuum cleaner and I wish I could get my money back!"
5,Food Fight: Poets Join the Fight against Hunger With Poems,"Our After-school Book Bunch at Alexandria Public Library read the book Food Fight: Poets Join the Fight against Hunger With Poems to Favorite Foods. They each were asked to bring in a canned good for the local food pantry and while waiting to be served their MYSTERY MEAL the girls shared their favorite poems from the book. With six pre-teenage girls their favorite thing about the book of course, was that it was about food! They shared that they liked it when they read about their favorite foods with the favorite poem being the August Ice Cream. It was Short & Sweet! They would recommend this book to people of all ages - IF they like poetry, food and to eat!"
5,Outstanding!!!!!!,"This is honestly one of the best new albums I've heard in a long time and possibly one of the best that I've ever heard. It's packed with music that speaks volumes in terms of what's currently going on in the world. The song ""I Know"" is so true and passionate about the world and life. ""The Order Of Time"" is a musical masterpiece in 7/8 that reminds me of early Genesis. The love song ""My Love For You Will Always Be"" is incredibly touching and emotional. All in all, this entire album is top knotch. These guys really know how to compose great music. If you like Peter Gabriel and Genesis, you'll Love SIRIS."
5,Excellent!,"I recently decided it was time to own a dog, a new adventure for me. But since I spend lots of time outdoors, hiking, fishing, and enjoying nature, I needed the right dog as my companion. I just happened to see ""Hiking with Dogs"" and after giving it a flip-thru, my attention was grabbed. I read it cover-to-cover that evening and what a help! I learned what breed to buy, how to train him for my outdoor lifestyle, trail etiquette (I never knew there was such a thing), and tons of other helpful information that gives me the confidence to take my ""new best friend"" with me into nature. Thank you Linda Mullally, your experience and information were invaluable, and your obvious caring for canines is much appreciated!"
2,A Mismatched Couple,"Fatty's Spooning Days, 1915 filmFatty plays a piano for the maid and is chastened for being too kind to the help. They go to a park and sit on a bench. A policeman sits in a tree to watch for any couple that breaks the law (""spooning not allowed""). Fatty and his girl are brought in (""$30 or 30 days""). They make a telephone call for help. Their fines are paid and they are released. [This would probably be better if there was an audio track to better explain the events.] It records the culture of that era.Roscoe Arbuckle had a sudden fall from popularity when he was wrongfully accused of a vile crime that led to a woman's death. Do people have a hidden desire to hate popular entertainers? Does this remind you of Bennie Hill's comedies?"
3,It is ok,"This product has a purpose. I do think that it looks a little ""cheap"". It almost looks as if the ""chrome"" color is about to peel off. You can see areas on the product that are bent/dent, I am thinking it might be a chrome ""sticker"" type product on the outside. I received this as a gift, otherwise I would have returned it as I don't think it would be worth the price. I am also concerened about cleaning this item after use as it looks like it coudl easily scratch/peel. However it is a great way to quickly separate salt/sugar/lime."
1,It only lasted 3 weeks,I am used to bulbs lasting 3-6 months. This one lasted only 3 weeks which is not long enough for a bulb that cost $12
3,Not Free SF Reader,"There is no big surprise as to what the monster is here. Nor the protagonist of the novel. Harry Erskine, charlatan in trouble is also in this book.His godfather is dead, and he goes to his house to take care of his affairs, and discovers some strange things, like a lack of faces and a buried Persian jar.Cue badness."
5,Great value and quality!,"Perfect fit for E39 M5 factory air boxes. I always purchase K&N air filters for my all cars and most of the time on Amazon, because of the great deals! Power increase? Well M5 has 400HP so it's hard to tell if you get extra 5hp :-)"
5,One of the best from one of the best!,"Brian Tracy is one of the best motivation speakers out there, and this is one of his best programs. And at $20 for six compact discs, it's one of his best values, too.Six hours of Brian Tracy telling you that you can get what you want and do what you dream is enough to get anybody fired up and ready to go. More than just motivation, though, this program is packed with practical suggestions on what to do and how to do it. I especially liked the seven ways to develop my intelligence and the four questions to ask myself to know if I'm doing a good job. And now that I understand what a waste of time it is to worry about money, I can see how much more energy I have to devote to creating my financial independence.Believe in yourself enough to listen to Brian Tracy, and he'll put it all within your reach!"
4,just tell the story,"I thank Mr Murray for writing a well researched biography and letting John Lee Hooker tell his own story. But I would offer him (or any other would-be biographers) the following suggestion: people are not interested in hearing how hip you are, they're interested in John Lee Hooker. Try to make yourself as inconspicuous as possible; don't get in the readers face with frequent references to ""your correspondent""; use your own voice without inserting phrases in pseudo-Black English which only sound affected and draw attention to yourself instead of the subject matter (people writing on blues musicians often feel the need to sound hip and street-wise). Just tell the story."
3,Better than nothing but...,"When someone does that other book, I trust their research will be more thorough. Murray goes on for a long paragraph about Hooker's birth year. A quick simple search of the 1920 Census, available years before this book was published, showed John Lee was seven then. Murray doesn't even give 1913 among the 4 years he listed. For our few pages about Hooker in Dedicated Dads: Stepfathers of Famous People (available amazon.com), our author found some interesting anecdotes on a CD liner--Murray missed them, too. And I agree that Murray went on and on and injected himself too much."
2,Disappointing,As a long time fan of John Lee I really looked forward to reading this book. Unfortunately the writer spent more time editoralizing about the sins of America in general and the south in particular and very little time on the actual subject of the book. The writers bias against the U.S. came across very clearly.There are sections in the book that go on for pages without even discussing John Lee or his music. If the author had stayed off his soapbox he could have covered the same material in 100 pages instead of the 480+ pages he required. All in all I found the book very boring and a chore to read. I was glad when it was over. I love John Lee but hated the book.
3,Last of the Legends,"With the exception of B.B. King, this was one of our last links to the true Blues greats. This book really misses out on the opportunity to expound on all the pathes crossed and the people he met along the way. This book is written very eloquently and there is no sparing of words. John Lee Hooker was a grass roots person, and this book should have been written that way. I looked forward to reading this book, but I have to admit that it was a very boring read. Hard to believe a book about John Lee Hooker being boring. I hope someone else picks up the pieces and put's another book on the streets."
3,start reading on page 80!,"I have to confess I nearly put the book down for good after the first 50 or so pages. It read like a sociology paper! Boring. But once the writer started into Hookers life it picked up and became quite enjoyable. I especially enjoyed the interviews with friends and family. It did give me an insight into his life. And having met him years ago in a club, I can agree that he was an incredibly sociable and friendly man. Totally unique. There will never be another just like him."
2,A disappointment,The author seems to have been under the mistaken impression that those of us reading a biography about John Lee Hooker actually wanted to read a book about Charles Shaar Murray. This could have been so much better.
5,Best Arabic Learning tool!!!!,"This book is exactly how I rated it, 5 stars. For a student studying Arabic, it's the best way to expand your vocabulary. All of the literature in the book is in Arabic with a glossary after the passage to help the student learn new words.As for the diverse material covered in the Anthology, it has everything from Jahilliya love poetry to the Prophet's (pbuh) last sermon to certain excerpts from Andalusian and Medieval Sufis such as Ibn Rushd and Hallaj. It even covers some stories from Kalila wa Dimna.The attached CD with the book is awesome as you can read along with the speaker to learn the proper pronounciation and rhythym of certain poetry. If you are tired of reading the same old Al-Kitaab part I/II/or III and you want to finally test and use your Arabic skills, get this book.An awesome buy and highly recommended!!"
1,The cover says it all,"Yes, you can judge some books by their covers, and this is one of them. The title on the cover, depicted in lower case with Vietnamese diacritics over the letters, exhibits a shocking insensitivity to Vietnamese language and culture. The novel is no better. Anyone with the slightest familiarity with Vietnamese people--particularly those who came to the United States--will not recognize the characters. Apparently, the author did not take advantage of her work as a refugee coordinator to get to know these people in any depth. Their depiction is so shallow as to be insulting."
1,A Real Disappointment,"A tenth grade level lecture on sin, with little or no help on how to deal with it. No useful revelations here. Buy something else. bk"
5,foot wear,Since I own [3] doxies these socks have been fun to wear. Glad there is a place to order :ONLY DOXIE : STUFF.
4,A Great Deal!,"After checking this video out of the library 2 times, and seeing my tennis game improve dramatically, I decided to buy my own copy! It's a great deal - for less than the price of a court rental, I can watch the video over and over to refresh and review basic skills. I thought this was great and will watch it several times in the future. Yes, there is alot of information, but that's what the rewind button is for."
4,Good Italianate performance in so-so sound,"This is, I assume, an RAI broadcast from the 1960s. It is just the sort of thing that you might have expected from Cetra in the 1950s.It captures the great Tito Gobbi in one of his signature parts and surrounds him with a cast of good but not incandescently talented singers, although the bright and youthful-sounding lead soprano and tenor are perfectly satisfactory in their roles.The sound captured for this performance is not up to that of the EMI studio recording that Gobbi did with de los Angeles. On the other hand, it is not lumbered with the beefy groaning of EMI's egregious tenor, Carlo dal Monte.This set has the virtue of being a stand-alone serving of far-and-away the best part of Puccini's ""Trittico"" at an attractive price. Being dal Monte-free, it is greatly to be preferred over Gobbi's EMI version.And of course--anyone who hears it even once will forever know how to pronounce ""Gianni Schicchi""!"
4,The great Gobbi at a bargain price,"Since you can grab this live-broadcast Gianni Schicchi for next to nothing at Amazon Marketplace, it's hard to pass up Tito Gobbi in one of his most famous roles. The sound is dull and chipped off at the top but free of distortion. The sizable cast of character singers is good from top to bottom, although not as lively as on Gobbi's well-known studioo set from EMI, which is in early stereo. I agree with the reviewer above that it's nice to do without the bawling of tenor Carlo del Monte on the EMI set, but it's a loss not to have de los Angeles. The decisive thing here is probably Pradella's conducting, which is mroe lively and light-handed than Santini's for EMI.So, even if you own and love the other Gobbi version, this one has a lot to commend it."
2,BABBERY not battery,It said BABBERY on the back instead of battery. How much more fake can that get? The B and T aren't even next to each other on the keyboard! But I guess it's fine because it works a bit decent... whatever
1,Destroyed my Computer,I installed this battery in my computer and less than a day later the computer started smelling burnt. I shut the computer down and it wouldn't turn back on again. I took it apart and saw that the motherboard had literally burned in a spot right between the battery jack and the power input. I seem to not be the only person that this has happened to. All I could do is get my money back and I had to buy a new computer (motherboard is about $300-$400 to replace). DO NOT BUY THIS!!
4,Good Battery,"This battery charged correctly, discharged correctly and provides about 3 hours of service in power saver mode. If it has a three year life to it, it will prove to be as good, or better than the original HP battery. Fast delivery, good fit, satisfied customer so far............"
4,So far so good,My battery fit perfectly into my dv9000 hp pavillion laptop....So far the battery life has proved adequate and similar to the factory battery when I first bought the machine....The price is very very fair....
1,Don't Buy..,It burnt the inside of my computer and burned the hell out of the battery itself. I e-mailed these people 3 times and have yet to recieve a reply.
2,Works well but fit is not perfect,"I have a HP DV9000 laptop. I received the battery, and put it in. The compartment would lock, but the battery does not fit flush. It extends out of the case a few millimeters. This bugs me but not enough to go thru the hassle of a return. Otherwise, the battery seems to work as stated. If it had fit flush I would have given this item 4 or 5 stars."
2,You Get What You Pay For,"So, a laptop battery for about $25.00? Really? And you expect it to be something special? And to work well, for an extended period of time? Well, I tried it, and I got what I paid for . . . a cheapo battery.In my HP Pavilion laptop, the HP Total Care Advisor never once rated this battery better than ""poor."" It never fully charged, despite me following all of the tedious battery conditioning instructions. It worked about 22 minutes better than the original battery, from 2007, but rapidly lost that edge. Just recently I went to the HP site and laid out about $120 for a genuine battery that is now at 100% full charge and is rating ""excellent"" by the computer's monitoring programs.Bottom line: So, you want a cheapo battery? This is it, sho'nuff. But consider what you are NOT paying for, and you'll get a full idea of the performance this battery will provide for you."
1,battery replacement,Was excited to receive replacement battery. However 1 month after installation the power source fried my computer. Not sure if it was battery however my computer was only 3 years old. I only use it for home use. Took it in for service and they told me it could have been the battery.
1,Wrong battery,I am unsatisfied because the wrong model battery was sent. I specifically ordered the battery for the laptop I own.
3,Works but doesn't last too long,"I was hoping it would charge enough to be able to use my laptop for several hours without needing to recharge it, but it doesn't. 2-3 hours at the most."
4,battery review,I was satisfied with the battery. Delivery was speedy and I had no problem installing it to my computer. The price was very reasonable.
2,Buy this book for reference,This book seems to be targeted for people who wants to know differences between XML and SGML. Good book as a reference but do not try this book while learning.
5,Excellent book for DTD designers,"This book is great if you are looking on how to design DTDs. For that you need to already know about XML. It is not a ""software"" book in the sense that it does not have a line of code and it does not explain to you how to ""program"" XML. I have already read some books about XML and how to program it. I wanted a book which could explain to me how to design a DTD so I could create my own XML application. I found that book! However, before you buy this book, make sure that it really corresponds to what you are looking for."
4,Almost the perfect book about DTDs,"The best book available... it covers everything you need to know about DTDs.I guess this book may have originated as an SGML book so has examples oriented more towards SGML authors. These examples are not oriented towards Internet Programmers.Still, the author did a pretty good job at seperating XML and SGML specific details.Simply put, If you need to design a DTD then you need this book."
3,an enjoyable light read!,"I enjoyed this book and the main characters. The changes and learning process the hero goes through really makes you cheer for him. The leading lady is a strong well defined character, who handles landing in another time and place believeably...(i.e., confusion, disbelief, anger, despair)... Why they say she is manacled to a wall in his bedroom is confusing, for that isnt the case, she gets thrown in the dungeon. All in all, this is a very good book, but its lacking something. Maybe too much paranoia about her being deemed a witch, I'm not sure, but its worth reading."
3,I liked it a little,"This book could have been better. I would of liked the story of John and Sidney as a whole book. I was much more interested in their story than Kane's and Katharina's. But this book was pretty interesting so I can't give it any less than three stars. If you like time travel romances, pick this one up."
2,Average & a bit wishy washy,"The characters in this book jump into love almost instantly. Its very old fashioned. The hero spends most of his time trying to resist the heroine & then jumping her bones. The love scenes are vague & not very inspiring. The story of is a nice one, but I don't think I would buy another of this auhtors books"
4,You get what you pay for,"Dependable, easy to use. Comes pre-loaded with songs that are difficult to get off which takes up memeory space. Good first MP3 for a kid."
5,A useful tool for my shop,"This Forstner bit is quite a tool, allowing me to drill perfect holes of a diameter not usually found in the usual bits box. It is sharp and accurate and the price is excellent, especially when compared to the usual hardware stores. The box alone is worth at least 2-3 dollars !!!!!!!!!!!! Purchased at Amazon.com"
1,Garbage,"Although I had slightly more success with soft pine than the other reviewers of this brand of drill bit, this will not cut through any kind of hardwood. I thought maybe I got one that they forgot to sharpen, so I sharpened it. Worked a little better for about 3 seconds, went dull, and wouldn't drill through the wood. Sharpened it again even more carefully with the same result. Although it isn't always true that you get what you pay for with tool accessories, it is in this case. Buy Freud instead."
5,Human Thunder,"Throw away all your CD's of other singers doing these songs.You'll never need them again! Here is without a doubt the greatest tenor voice of this century and the last. I had the pleasure and privilege to hear Giacomini in person in the early nineties with Ricardo Muti and the Philadelphia Orchestra in a concert performance of Puccini's Tosca, recorded live, hard to find now but well worth checking out. I'm not exaggerating when I say the floor literally shook as he sang! A powerful instrument but able to color and modulate the tone. These songs most of which are well known and oft recorded take on new life with Giacomini. Recorded at the age of 61 you would never know it as the voice still sounds as fresh and vibrant as ever.The 3 tenors + do not even come close to the artistry of this musical giant. If you've never heard him you are in for a real treat. If you have heard him, then you know what i'm talking about!"
5,The Definitive Spaghetti CD,"If you thought you knew neopolitan italian songs, you have to go buy this CD. Giacomini encorporates the Melochi method of signing just as beautifully in these italian songs as he does on his aria albums. If you are mafia, you should be driving your caddie while listening to this cd. I expect nothing less. This tenor is so cavaliere it is frightening. Buy all his albums immediately or you cannot say you know tenors."
2,Stick to Little Richard's 50s Music,"You will be disappointed if you're expecting real rock and roll. This compilation is enough to make Sally, Lucille, and Molly want to picket in protest. With a few exceptions, instead of straight-on 50s style rock and roll, Little Richard is serving up a smorgasbord of tired soul slop and funk junk. He literally murders old Beatles, Rolling Stones, Creedence Clearwater Revival, and Hank Williams tunes. In addition, a number of the songs are too long and monotonous. Save your money and pass on this 3-disc package."
2,Realistically scary but adhesive failed.,"The price was right at $3.99 but the product was a disappointment. I followed the directions for the adhesive to the letter (easy as they were all too brief). Unfortunately, I think there's probably a shelf life on the stuff and it failed to stick to either their teeth or mine. I improvised with some sticky wall tack (not so tasty) and managed to carry off my MC duties as Igor, but barely. I guess you get what you pay for in this case."
3,"Under 10 Minutes, and Yet I Can't Complain","This release is ridiculous to anyone except for true believers, consisting of 6 songs that TOTAL 9 minutes of music...that sound as if they were recorded on a portable cassette recorder (probably were)....with the most nave drumming imaginable (and the absolute worst drum sound, too). If nothing else, it's worth mentioning that two tracks on this EP provided the titles for two subsequent GBV albums (""Bee Thousand"" and ""Alien Lanes""). ""Bee Thousand"" is also notable for sounding like what might happen if Little Red Riding Hood were to stumble upon Captain Beefheart in the middle of a bad drunk. Absurd? Oh, yes. Fun(ny)? Yeah...maybe even good, too...to somebody. B+ - Tom Ryan"
5,The stories are really gripping.,"I have never seen a more honest look at a sexual topic. It's obvious that this was directed and shot by women, but men still play a major role in each story told. It's amazing how this experience cuts across race, age and culture and seems to be remarkable similar. It's a story that all young people should hear. Watch it with your daughter or son."
1,Could this be made any cheaper?,"I bought two of these slightly over a year ago. They had light use (considerijng they were in storage due to a move) and both hubs have broken. I believe a cast aluminum or steel hub design would be better, as my two units are now in the trash. I am here to find a better solution to replace both units."
4,Hose Hideaway,I've had one of these for about a year -- and I love it -- no more coiling hoses; just crank the handle and it winds up the hose.
2,Not so good,"+1 Star for having a foot anchor while you are reeling, otherwise see other 1 Star reviews. BTW This item is half the price on Targets website."
2,Low priced but you get what you pay for,"this is probably the lowest priced hose reel you can find, but don't expect much. the handle and reel are plastic and will break with time and usage. i had one and it lasted one year, with fairly light use (i'm now shopping for a better replacement and saw this unit and thought i would share my experience). it leaked, so i had to constantly shut the water off at the faucet. also, i believe the design of the inlet valve is poor and significantly reduces the water pressure. if all you're looking for is a way to hide and unsighlty hose, this might be good enough for you. if you are planning to use it often, invest in something more sturdy."
2,O.K. but has issues,I have used the product for two years and got a surprise this spring when the inlet hose attachment popped off when water back pressure was applied. Maybe there is an easier way to fix this but I ended up disassembling the reel to find out what the problem was. The inlet and outlet tubes are secured together with a two-sided white clip. The clip had jammed open which meant the inlet tube could not click (lock) in place. I have read elsewhere where other people had the same problem. Some people got frustrated and threw the unit away but this is certainly a fixable problem if you have the patience to take the reel apart without destroying it.
2,awkward and does not deliver as promised,"This hose reel is rated at 100 foot capacity, but it will not reel my 75 foot hose in completely.As if that isn't bad enough, it starts to ""walk with you"" when you pull the hose, instead of letting the hose freely run off the spindle.When reeling the hose back in, the box jumps all over the place and if you try to hold it down with your foot on the footrest underneath, risk a twisted or cut ankle.I imagine it would be a very nice product for someone with a 25 foot hose."
2,"If you have room, buy the one with a hose track","I own one Suncast hose box, the one with a moving track to guide the hose while winding it in. Although we had leaks initially, tightening the connections with a wrench worked well. I wanted a hose in a different part of the garden where there is another faucet but not room enough for the larger box so I ordered this smaller one. There is a hose guide, but it does not move independently of the hose and one's hand. The result is that you are buying a decent looking box, but winding it in is just as difficult as wrestling with a coiling hose without a box. If you have the space, save your money and go for the larger version. It costs more but is well worth it in frustration-reduction. I have yet to use the hose which was placed in the box just today. I expect to be tightening the connections with a wrench. If I had not bought this from Amazon but from the local big box store I would be returning it."
1,Owned 3 Suncast Hideway boxes none lasted over 2 years.,"Hose connector eventually pops off and won't stay connected.These seem to be the only choice at Home Depot, Lowes andWalmart. I would relate these to a bic lighter, use it for a while, then throw it away."
1,Weak handle,I bought a 100' kink free hose for this box and the handle broke after reeling in 20' on the first use. I'm taking it back and looking for something stronger.
3,Not for people in a hurry,An OK product overall. Stable when reeling in but is a snug fit for a 100' hose. Need to align your coils as best as you can when reeling in otherwise hose won't fit. I should have bought a 125' reel. No problem with water pressure.
2,Choose another!,"After 15 minutes of wrestling with this reel, I decided to return it. I have 100' of 3/4"" hose and this product is too flimsy to handle it - the box moves around when winding (too light) and the hose got stuck over the edge of the reel first time. It might be OK for a very lightweight hose, but after some research I've decided to spend the extra and get a Rapid Reel instead."
2,Save Your Money,"While I have no real complaints about the quality of the product, I do dare anyone to show me how they get 100 feet of hose reeled into this!I have 75 ft medium duty 3/4 inch garden hose and no matter how carefully I've tried to reel it in, the most I can get on the reel is about 60 ft. I guess if I went out and bought the flimsiest 1/2 inch hose I could find I might be able to get it reeled in, but I have my doubts."
1,Shoddy,I bought one of these eight months ago and it is already broken. The part where the short hose connects to the spindle broke. The design concept is great but the plastic used is not nearly substantial enough for regular use or exposure to the elements. Why have a hose storage device that will biodegrade upon exoposure to sunlight or cold?
1,Pile of Junk,"I have had one of this companies products for two years. It self destructed. The company is not easy to deal with on warranty claims. They expect you to know their parts numbers, etc. I would not buy one of their products ever again and I recommend you do not either."
1,"Did not receive what I intended to purchase, and it went downhill from there!","I read LCD monitor and I thought that is what I needed to get. Actually I needed a widescreen LCD filter, so the one I ordered I had to return. Although Amy was helpful in letting me know how to measure it,when it came to returning it, I not only paid for the shipping fees, but I also had to pay a restocking fee! I ended up paying about $30 in returns, when the original product cost $75. Won't be doing business with this company again and I suggest others do the same!"
4,Great for the price!,"I ordered these last minute for a dinner party and they worked out wonderfully. I got lots of complements and people asking where I had purchased them. They are a little on the thick side, which is why I gave them a four and not five, but still very delicate and elegant looking. My only complaint would be with Amazon, not Libbey... the box of glasses came packed in a container filled with an entire garbage bag's worth of styrofoam peanuts. A big mess to get out of the box and throw out. But other than that, beautiful."
3,They look handmade,"Well, the glasses definitely look handmade... not sure if that was the goal, but there are obvious defects in the order of 24 I have ranging from different thicknesses throughout the glass to one glass that is sort of Leaning-Tower-of-Pisa-ish. They look better than the $1 World Market glasses, but not 3x as good. Will keep them as our party is tomorrow, but don't expect the best quality.They did come well packed with some very nice bubble wrap. Thanks Amazon."
2,Flutes Damaged,"I ordered two boxes of the flutes for an engagement party and I am disappointed. In one of the boxes, three out of six flutes were damaged. Two flutes were broken and one was chipped. I must send one of the boxes containing the damaged flutes back for a refund and submit a new order to obtain replacements."
5,Bought these for a friend,"These a gorgeous, durable and everything you want in a Champagne flute. I sent them to a friend for the holidays and my she loved them."
4,Really great for the price,"After considering buying ""disposable"" champagne glasses for my engagement party, I decided that buying inexpensive ""real"" glasses would be a better idea since the disposables were a dollar each anyway. So I purchased 5 sets of these and had our hired bartenders rinsing them as needed.I was very pleased. These are not thin and delicate, but they do not feel cheap either. After the party I gave away 3 of the 5 sets and kept 2 for myself. I felt no need to ""upgrade"" to a fancier champagne glass. These are just fine. In the 1.5 years I've had them, none of broken, but they'd had semi-regular use. I recommend these without reservation as a nice economical but still well-made and nice-feeling champagne flute."
1,Forgetaboutit,Do not waste your money.there is some kind of velcoo wraparound that cannot be removed and NO INSTRUCTIONS at all. There is no way to take it apart to the different sizes without breaking it.
1,great book... bad shape!!!!,"OK I understand the word ""used"" but this book is trash! Don't tell me that someone didn't inspect this thing. First, it was an old (overdue)library book that looked like it was in the back seat of someones car for ten years... It has been written in, Highlighted, taped, torn, and SH@*^T on. the dust cover had unidentifiable shmag all over and inbetween. THE WORST !!!! Don't ever get used books from here."
5,"6"" Deflecto Louvered Vent","Part works well. I suggest that the on-line info make it clear that the 6"" dimension refers to the diameter of the connecting pipe"
2,"Good, but ......","Nice unit but it doesn't keep out the cold of winter weather. The louvers are relatively efficient but need regular lint cleaning - as does the rest of the vent ""pipe.""I strongly suggest some additional sealing (device or tape)to keep out the drafts and cold during winter months."
3,Nothing Special,"I may be in the minority, but I found this book ""OK"". Plot a little thin, 33 year-old virgin??? Everyone else has regurgitated the plot so I won't add my inexpert synopsis..maybe I am getting jaded with all the so-so books out there but I just couldn't get into the characters (although the meddling mother was somewhat familiar)"
5,Millie Criswells Newest Fan,Hilarious and very entertaining. Laugh out loud reading. I'm buying everything she has ever written.
5,Millie Criswell has made her mark in romantic comedy,"The trouble with this book is that I couldn't put it down. The Trouble with Mary actually had me laughing out loud (while my poor husband was trying to sleep!). I think every woman can relate to Mary's struggle to maintain her independence and have a relationship as she also copes with her crazy dysfunctional family (thank God for chocolate!). Speaking of chocolate, I must have gained ten pounds just reading this book. The recipes printed at the beginning of each chapter were such a clever idea. Millie Criswell has certainly found her niche in romantic comedy. I can't wait for What to Do About Annie."
3,eh........,"I was really looking forward to reading ""The trouble With Mary""..but I have to say that I was left disappointed. I just couldnt get into the characters..and I found that their relationship lacked chemistry and was too rushed to be believable. This was an ok story, but I dont think Id buy another Millie Criswell."
3,Not bad,"I had trouble getting into this one. I know there is another one out but I just getting find it as funny as I would have like. Not a bad book, just not real funny."
3,There are better books on the subject,"Skip this book and buy ""Dreams, a Portal to the Source..."" instead. Hollis could have done better with this book. It is too light and therefore doesn't really get you anywhere."
4,Fabulous Performance,"My enthusiasm for this recording must be tempered by the fact that I have never heard any of the music before. Further, the accompanying information does not even mention the vocal range of the performers and offers only the most cursory plot summary. Having established these caveats, I thoroughly recommend this performance. The music is prime Rossini in the seria mode, with wonderful florid arias and stirring choruses. The peformers are terrific; Ghiaurov, Verrett, Petri, Garaventa, and especially the woefully underrated Teresa Zylis-Gara are in superb voice, and Wolfgang Sawallisch, who also conducts the other available recording of ""Mose,"" leads the RAI in an exciting live performance (1968). The sound is good vintage, and the audience is amazingly quiet. In fact, there is so little applause within the acts that I suspect the audience was as unfamiliar with the opera as I."
5,A Master at Work!,"Even though I'm very partial, being a huge Bon Jovi fan, this album shows Mr. Bryan versatility in music styles, from a slow balads to his piano version of Bon Jovi's ""In These Arms"" which he co-wrote, we the fans get to see and hear this musical genius on his own. I hope this won't be his only solo effort."
5,Chair Dancing,"I can't stand up for any legnth of time,since I have Multiple Sclerosis and thisvideo let's me strenghthen my legs. Each excercise is only 8 repeats and the whole video is about half hour long. There are excercises for your back, arms and more."
1,Poor service,"I did not receive what I ordered, but It was suffciiently close to what I wanted that I decided to keep it. Please tell the vendor to be more careful.DFBradley Attorney-at-Law"
5,Amazing!,"I had this for the first time at a deli in my hometown. I've since moved and pined for it for nearly 10 years. Just found a grocery store that has it! It's sweet, tangy, and wonderful!"
2,Doesn't make the mustard,"I'm an avid fan of the B.B. honey sweet mustard and the B.B. hot mustard. I ordered a case of this mustard thinking it would be as great as the others and because we often times mix the honey sweet mustard with cranberry sauce. Quite honestly, neither my husband nor I care for this product much. I can't explain exactly why but we just don't care for the taste. I'm thinking I might use it for marinades and spice it up a bit or use it for glazes. But as a garnish for meats or veggies it just doesn't make the mustard."
3,Not What I Expected,I love cranberries and mustard! BUT this combo tastes like mustard with maybe one cranberry that ran through! IT is good but not fruity enough.
1,This title is used calibrating a video playback device,"While I enjoy watching bars and tones for a lengthy period of time while I calibrate my Sony monitor, it should be clear that calibration is the only use of this title. This is not entertainment content. Please, please, please do not accidentally buy this movie."
5,Loads of fun,"My 21month old loves the busy book series. The busy piggies is where we got started and somthing about seeing real pictures just drove him to giggles. It was a library book he did not want to return. Sadly the bookstores here only had a busy bunnies book. He didnt giggle quite as much but he still enjoyed it. Now we have expanded to busy monkeys and this on had him giggling madly on my lap. I dont know what it is about these books, but toddlers love em!"
5,Awesome score!,"This score carries all the excitement of the movie with it. I especially like track 3, ""Costume Montage."" Danny Elfman is a genius. I used to think that he could only write dark, dreary scores. This one is somewhat dark, but it's way more exciting than such scores as Edward Scissorhands and even Batman. This score is closer to Men In Black (also Elfman) in style. The sound quality of the disc is also very good. Sounds just like in the movie theater when I play it on my computer speakers. If you like Danny Elfman's work, get this CD!"
3,"Holy wrong tone, Batman!","I don't know why or how this soundtrack is getting so many 5 star ratings. It is strictly average material -- a lot of horns blowing in an extended homage to the infinitely superior Batman soundtrack. I'll forgive a little self-borrowing -- after all, I am a John Williams fan -- but only in moderation.In this case, the somber tone that served the Batman soundtrack so well poorly suits a more light-hearted character like Spider-Man. The Batman-esque tones work well with the pieces associated with the dark, conflicted Green Goblin, like ""Parade Attack,"" ""Transformations,"" and even ""Final Confrontation."" But the non-Goblin parts of the movie called for a different tone, yet the soundtrack doesn't deliver.I guess what I wanted was music that initially sounded carefree, but upon further listening, revealed the tragic underpinnings of Spider-Man's character. This soundtrack delivers a lot of the second, but little of the first."
2,batman bastardized?,"I am not a frequent reviewer but the lack of critical words for this obvious 'by the numbers' superhero soundtrack has driven me to do so. Though the above mentioned 'numbers' were admittedly Elfman's own (as far as I know), this score is to say the least shameless if not insulting."
3,A little disappointed,"I was very excited when I found out that the actual soundtrack for ""Spider-Man"" was being released, so excited that I went out and bought it the first day. I've listened to it five or so times already, and I've been somewhat disappointed. Somehow, I remember it being much better when I was actually watching the movie.First of all, it is only about 45 minutes long, so if you were hoping for one of those hour-long soundtracks, then this isn't the one for you. Second, I found a lot of the songs to be ""quieter"" than I expected. Certainly not car CD player fare.However, Danny Elfman's score has it's redeeming moments. ""Main Title,"" ""Costume Montage,"" and ""City Montage"" are the tracks that standout the most to me.Bottom Line: Only buy this if you really have a thing for Spider-Man or are a big Danny Elfman fan."
4,"Another memorable, hummable Elfman score","In yet another proof of why we should never listen to those goofs who write early screener reviews, I came into the Spider-Man film prepared to be disappointed by the Danny Elfman score. The AICN geeks had said it lacked a main theme and that it didn't have the 'punch' that Elfman's work usually does.Boy, were they wrong! As soon as I saw the movie, its driving, heroic themes resounded in my head well after the movie was over (all 3 times I've seen it!). I finally picked up the score CD and it reinforces the power of Elman's compositions and the mood it sets for the webslinger.The main titles, costume montage and 'Spectre of the Goblin' are all as memorable Elfman as you can get. This is up there close to the Batman soundtrack, in my mind and a really great disc to pick up for Spidey or Elfman fans."
5,mmmm..Panini's!,I bought this as a gift for my girlfriend who got hooked on Panini's after a recent trip to NYC. So far she has used this to cook everything she possibly can fit on it! I have seen some cheaper models but was not impressed with the construction. Cuisinart just builds good stuff.
4,Much better then the Foreman Grill,"I was a little hesitant buying this grill -- I had a George Foreman that was hard to clean and food stuck after the first month. This little grill is light years ahead in terms of quality, construction, and food cooking ability. I use this grill 2-3 times per week! It is great for fish, burgers, and grilled cheese sandwiches! I have been very pleased with the grill. The only minor complaint is that, at the hottest setting, the aluminum cooking tray on the bottom warps on the left side and raises up about 1/4 inch."
4,Great Item,"Love the ease of changing cooking grids and the ease of clean up. The temperature control is a real positive. The only negative I have found is the rim around the grids is pretty low, and when cooking bacon, you have to be sure to keep the grease from overflowing. Well worth the investment."
1,DO NOT GET THIS GRIDDLE,"I got this as a wedding present. I have had to return this product 4 times because it has broken.The first time it broke after a month of use (the hooks that hold the griddle plates broke so the plates would not stay on).Twice it was broken out of the box (feet broken off because it is made of cheap metal).Once it broke after one use (the on off knob started turning it on).This product worked well, but has terrible build quality.I finally had to just get a refund. I gave this product 4 chance and it failed every time.DO NOT GET THIS PRODUCT"
2,Pannini Grill,"mediocre design - heats unevenly, overcooks directly over heat coils while center area undercooks. Grease from top grill drips down on to counter when the top of the unit is lifted. Can do as well with a cheap foreman grill.."
1,Makes A Mess,"I bought it thinking it would be an improvement over my older George Foreman since it had removable griddles for easy clean-up. Turns out cleaning the griddles is easier BUT the splatter from anything other than thin, flat sandwiches is a 30-minute clean-up with 409 [countertops, counter backsplash, under-cabinet, unit's exterior especially knobs]. And I'm talking about cooking with the cover DOWN! I would never try cooking any meats or vegetables with the lid open. And I'm surprised they couldn't engineer it so that the griddles would fit either side."
1,remanufactured or used,"Purchased this Cuisinart GR-4 in which was to have been remanufactured/factory recondition, but it seems to me who ever was remanufacturing these units would a least have cleaned them. The grill plates appeared to be new but grease from the last user was still draining from the spring coil covering the electrical cord. The stainless still top was covered with grease spots and finger prints. I called Consumer DIS-SERVICE at Cuisinart to inform them of the way I have received this unit and suggested a little more Quality Control. THEY COULD CARE LESS. With the attitude of Cuisinart I strongly suggest to leave this unit at amazon.com"
3,(refurbished) BEWARE,sounded like a good deal...it worked about 2 months then the burner quit working...its better to pay full price for a new one...
4,great!,"the first time i ordered it, the grill plates were a little scratched up, but i sent it back and got some great condition ones! might be a hit or a miss, but definitely a better deal than buying a brand new one. it does what it says and functionally the same!"
4,Cuisinart Griddler,Have not used a whole lot but we like it very well. It replaces a griddle of like size that we used for several years. This one seems to better built.
4,Very pleased with the Cuisinart Griddler,"The Griddler arrived well packed and in good condition. All the parts were included as well as a user manual/cookbook. It has a few small chips in the non-stick coating on one of the griddle plates but they don't impair it's use. Overall it is in great shape and works well. I've had a couple of the ""other"" brand electric grills before and have been happy with their performance, but I'm pleased to say this one works even better than those have. I'd recommend this Griddler to a friend without reservation."
4,Fine product,I was hesitant at first but decided to take a chance and am glad I did. This is a fine product and the griddle is excellent - bacon and eggs come out great. The grill is very good as well - burgers and chops and chicken taste very good. The heat here is more than I expected and the meat is cooked through. I recommend it.
1,Refurbished=gamble,"I just received my factory refurbished item; apparently ""refurbished"" is French for scratched up to #$%%. The flat griddle plates have deep gouges in them. I called Cuisinart and you have to replace factory refurbished items in whole; they will not send individual parts. Cost to buy one replacement plate is 32.00 or, 64% of the cost of the entire item. 32.00 + 50.00 for refurbished equals: just buy a new one."
5,Better than New...well...almost.,"I have been totally pleased with this purchase. The Griddler came direct from the factory, shipped and packed perfectly. There wasn't a scratch on the unit, and it looked brand spankin' new, even those is was 'refurbished.' You couldn't tell. I was earlier concerned because the refurb units only carry a 3 month warranty, while the new ones carry a 3 year warranty. But no complaints. The griddles were flawless, not a speck of grease on the unti anywhere -- nothing. It's worked flawlessly, and I've had the best panini sandwiches ever which is the reason why I bought it."
1,Panasonic Lemon,"Initially, this player seemed to have all the right stuff. It worked for a total of five months and two days. Now, it won't play anything. I called Panasonic for customer support and was told that the lens was probably dirty and all that was needed was a lens cleaner. WRONG!! I used a lens cleaner and it still didn't work. I called Panasonic and was pretty much told that I was SOL (excuse the expression, but I am a disgruntled custome). Stay away from this LEMON!"
1,The Gift that never gives,"Recieved this unit as a present a few years ago, and have had nothing but problems with it. It's motor has died on my twice in that time, the lens once, and it will also not play CD-R or DVD-R media that even my X-box and PlayStation2 will play. If it wasn't a gift from someone I'm still living with, I would have replaced it with a different brand. DO NOT waste your money on this unit, it's outdated and very limited."
1,Panasonic no longer makes quality items,"Four months after I bought this player it also did the skipping, pixelated, black screen process due to overheating and condensation on the lens. I was charged the 85 dollars from Panasonic to have it fixed. Needless to say, less than six months after I got it back the problem started again. Now it will play a maximum of 35 minutes before the unit freezes (on cd's as well, not just dvd's.) I will never buy ANYTHING from Panasonic, or Panasonic affiliated companies again!!! Apparently they haven't figured out how to make a decent piece of equipment anymore because Amazon is loaded with bad reviews on their newest equipment as well. They got my 430 dollars, bent me over and said thanks."
1,Does not play CD-R's,"This player will not play home-burned CD's (CD-R and CD-RW). It notes this limitation in the instructions, so I suppose one can't really attack Panasonic for it, but that seems like an important feature these days since you are likely to burn or be given a home-burned CD at some point."
4,A Good DVD changer but cannot play CD-R,"This is a pretty good DVD player/changer with all the outputs you need. Component, S-video & Co-axial for video and Dolby Digital 5.1 & optical for audio. It comes with RCA cables that is pretty basic. I upgraded the video signal to an Acoustic Review S-video and the audio to optical. It made a lot of difference to the picture and sound. I hooked it to my home theater and the dolby output is astounding. The picture quality is good as any DVD player in the price range. The remote is pretty basic and it serves the purpose.Though I am satisfied with the performance I am not giving it a 5 star because of the following reasons. 1) It did not work initially and I had to get a replacement. 2) Called up panasonic and asked for help with problem they were not that helpful."
5,Great Picture & Sound,"The Panasonic DVD-CV50 is a great DVD player, but since it doesn't offer progressive scan you will want to pass if you have a HDTV.The picture is clean using the S-video connection on the back and the sound is superb using the optical cable connection. Setup is easy and straightforward, and the on screen controls make it easy to set your speaker system up.One thing you will want to note however is that if you decide to move the DVD player you first need to remove all the DVD's from the unit or they can become stuck in the player and possibly scratching the DVD's or damaging the player...."
2,A bit much for the result.,"This nozzle is OK but is nothing special. It is very heavy and actually functions no better than the ""red"" Karcher nozzle. It was used on tractors to try to remove grease and grime. After one day of use, it was put on the shelf. It is a bit expensive for a paper weight."
3,not thrilled,"Understand that this product is NOT genuine military issue. It is a cheap Chinese copy of the milspec AR15/M16 cleaning kit. With that comes the usual cheap Chinese threads, that have a tendancy to cross thread. And the oil bottle will leak. The cleaning rod is painted steel, unlike the phosphate oxide finish on the original kits. However, the steel is better than using a brass rod. The attatchments (bore brush, and chamber brush) will work well. I have mixed reaction to the claeaning patches supplied but they are better than nothing. The vinyl pouch that contains the parts, is aslo a cheap copy, and does not include the metal belt clip. You would be more satisfied buying an original US military cleaning kit."
3,Meh- I don't dream about it.,"For under 20 bucks I guess this an alright set. Cheap bag with chinchy tools inside. If I had to do it over, I'd just buy all the equiptment seperatly and put it in a better dedicated bag. Convenient to have but if you put in some effort you can build a better set."
3,Basic,"Ok nice simple product easy to put in your range bag for on the go cleaning. Nothing fancy but all you need, I don't like the rod but that's just me."
1,Not advertised package,"I received my cleaning kit in a different package than advertised. It was the standard shaped pouch, not the butt profiled one. Patches were also missing. Not honest advertising and will not use this company again."
2,spillage,The package came in a descent amount of time but the oil had leaked out inside the package and it was every where and on everything!!!!
4,Picture is not what you are getting,"I bought this for my buttstock to complete my retro look to my DPMS AR-15. When I received it the cleaning kit was not what was pictured, but it does work very well especially the chamber brush. After further research on the website I did receive the product that was described. It is easy to figure out how to put the rods together and they work better than several other cleaning rods."
1,Soft metal,"One of the cleaning rod extensions split and flared out over the below it, wedging itself in the bore. When I pulled it out, there were sharp edges that could have damaged my bore. Buyer beware!"
5,Great kit,For the price this is a great set up. It has everything you need to get your gun clean.note for the guys that disagree its not the kit its the person who's using it
5,This is one of the best recent Regency novels I have read...,"Mary Balogh's latest is one of her best. The book is exciting with a dashing, but thoughtful protagonist and a delightful heroine. The novel is quite sensual, while remaining comfortably ""regency"". The characters seem quite plausible, and through them, the author makes some keen observations about people. I highly recommend it"
5,Really Perfect,"This book was the best thing by Mary Balogh that I have ever read, hands down. The plot was perfection; the maturing of the hero was believable; the heroine was strong...AND it's sensual. Absolutely, five stars & worth the time & trouble to get a used copy."
2,"Stiff, kinks easy. Only good for occasional use where high flow is really needed.","It is a big 3/4"" hose and will flow more water than a typical 5/8"" hose. The extra flow is not really all that noticeable for typical yard watering needs.Heavy, but I expected that.Feels and acts like a vinyl hose. It is very stiff, even on the hottest day in full summer sun. It will not bend well and Kinks on itself constantly. It's not easy to un-kink with a tug either, you need to walk to the kink and fix it. Very frustrating. I went back to my 28 year old Sears Craftsman rubber 5/8"" hose which seldom kinks. When it does, a tug usually releases the kink.I put this hose in the back of the shed. I would use it for the occasional need to fill a pool or with a pressure washer where the extra water flow could be a benefit."
1,UIseless hose,"I have one of these that I ""inherited"" a few years ago. It's stiff as a board even in hot weather - difficult to move around and impossible to coil up or put on a hose rack. It's pretty much useless unless you leave it stretched out somewhere and don't need to move it"
4,Good hose,For every day use around home the 5/8 inch would be a better choice in my opinion. The 3/4 is a little stiff and heavy. However this hose is very well constructed and appears to be quite durable. I'm confident it is going to last season after season.
4,surprisingly good,Its like rock over hip hop beat...think sugar ray ''fly'' definately worth the change they're chargin for it.. Word is bond
2,Did D'Orazio shoot blanks?,"Arena Editions sends us a handful of photos that were not already printed in ""Sante D'Orazio A Private View"" from Penguin Studio. Along with the new few, we get lots of repeats. But to make up for offering not much new, Arena provides 3 color images, a few duotones, and lots of lifeless black and white reproductions, with all the interesting commentary from Private View stripped away. If you want commentary, though, perhaps you can write it yourself on the dozens of incomprehensibly blank pages. This layout suggests the publishers forgot to make printing plates for a third of the images, then said, ""Ah, the heck with it,"" when they discovered the error. ""A Private View"" is fun, high-energy beauty. This ain't."
5,A stellar work!,"Finally, a book of celebrity photographs which transcends the formula of merely exposing famous skin! Here is a book of rare and intimate sensuality which brings to the viewer's eye a private and lush sensuality which seems coaxed out of the sitters and never forced. D'Orazio is a genius and this book is one of the most amazing gifts I have received in years. I am buying it for several friends as it is a surefire, sophisticated winner. MORE!!"
2,Sux,"It's a discontinued model and Polar tech support is null. The word on the street is that Sonic Link through PC Coach software does not work, or at least reliably, with Vista or Windows 7. I write this only in case you want some info on the watch."
5,nice beam,I bought this for my 6 year old daughter. She loves it. It is just perfect for practicing her skills. It was also easy to put together!
4,VOICE BUDDY,It works but takes alot of time to teach it.It says it has 60 games already but you must have the 60 games on yourcomputer. Other wise its ok.
4,Good BBQ sauce,I been familiar with this sauce for over 30 years. I came from the Midwest to the West Coast where the product is hard to find. It is an excellent sauce for BBQ's ribs.
4,Well...,"This was written in the 1950s (if I remember correctly), when biographies were as a rule complimentary puff pieces about the subject. This is a bit like this and is much more focused on the Statler chain than on E M himself. In fact, most of the focus is on the chain at its zenith, just before it merged with the Hilton chain but long after Statler died. He is a pretty fascinating character in his own right but that's not the kind of scandal people looked for in biographies at the time."
1,Yikes,"A collection of instrumentals that were hits in Europe and predominantly Germany, or at least that's the impression from the liner notes. If you're American and survey the track list, it's mostly a collection of head scratchers, particularly after listening to it. There's a good reason most of these selections are relatively rare. In most cases, they're bad. In some others, they're very, very bad. The tracks with which you're familiar can be found on better sounding compilations, too. Not recommended."
5,Incredible Early Moodies Tracks!!,"This is a fine collection of vintage Moody Blues. Recorded between 1967 (before ""Days of Future Passed"") and covering their early Seven albums, this collection has the songs they DIDN'T put on the studio albums. Some are funny (Justin's wild vocals on ""Leave this man Alone"" for instance). Still, this is all with the Hayward/Lodge set and desperately needed by all Moodies fans. There are the 5 from ""Caught Live + 5"" and the early tracks from ""Time Traveller"" but the ONLY way to EVER get the gem ""Leave This Man Alone"" is on this grand collection. Not to be missed. A classic collection."
4,import report-prelude,"The earliest moody blues mixed with later songs. Six early songs sound just like 60's music yet, distinctively moodies. Six songs from ""live plus five"" and ""days of future passed. It is an enjoyable compilation."
4,Tasty but a little trite,"For those who, like myself, can't get enough of the Moody Blues, this is a great discovery. Others have described it as ""On the Threshold of a Dream II."" It does have that sort of feel to it, but the tracks are not quite up to that level of quality.It amazes me how good the selections are, because most of us are accustomed to modern bands whose greatest hits albums are loaded with filler, yet these cuts are a testament to how far superior the Moodies are to other bands. Even the stuff on their cutting room floor is better than most other music. The tracks are all quite good, but I just couldn't get quite as excited about them, obviously, as their classic pieces. Hence the 4 stars, instead of 5, which I would rate any of the Core 7 Moody Blues CDs."
5,SBS Excel 2003,The book was in excellent condition and I received it in a timely manner. It was exactly what I was looking for.
4,Microsoft Excel 2003 Step by Step,"I ordered several of these 'Step by Step' 03 books and your's came within the alotted time frame, but much later than the others; however, you still provided a very good service."
3,Too many mistakes,"I bought this to teach a class and there are so many mistakes that the students cannot do it on their own. We first need to do it together. Only after they know the problems, can they begin practicing on their own. BEWARE.For example they ask you to replace X with Y but in fact it should be Y with X. Graphs are not where they should be. It is confusing for students."
2,Not for Beginners! Many errors.,"The book is definitely not for teaching beginners, it is to prepare for the MOS cetification. However, many exercises have some sort of mistakes, either instructional or numeric type mistakes so that the exercises CANNOT be assigned as home work, but have to be done with the students in class and the ""BUGS"" worked out before they can do them on their own. It is a real shame to release a study book without proof reading it first and correcting the mistakes. An individual who is studying for the MOS Excel certification can get some good information from the book, but a student will be very confused if not very frustrated using it. Even as an instructor I get frustrated over the numerous errors. I have one suggestion: I'll correct the errors if the author/publisher pays me for doing the work."
1,"Beware, mac users","I had to return this book. No reflection on the book itself. This is more of a comment on how Amazon describes its books. You must have an Windows operating systems in order to use this book and CD. This isn't mentioned in the product description. Amazon quickly gave me a refund, but it's still a drag if you're on a tight training schedule. Order from Peachpit press or another other Mac-friendly series."
3,Lack of Clarity.,"This book give step by step instruction on how to do pretty much everything you could want with Excel. But there are several instances where there are typos/ misprints, or a simple lack of intructions. Overall, the book tought me excel when I had advanced computer skills but no excel skills. This is a good Excel book, but their are other, more clear books that will teach you Excel"
2,Night school text book,"This book was the biggest waist of money I have been stuck with in a long time. It was a ""must have"" for a night school class. Everyone found it long winded, confusing, and hard to follow. I know its an ""official"" class book but I found. the ""Excel Short Cuts"" much faster and better written. The step by step was like pulling teeth for the whole class. Its might be better for people that like long winded manuals and not getting the facts and getting to work"
2,Good story gone astray,"Something went wrong with this story. It starts out with a very cute bachelor auction premise where the heroine wins the hero, but in the next chapter, for no good reason I can think of, it turns out the bachelor she won refuses the honor the win and throws her to his brother. Then there's another chapter with him saying, ""I don't know what you're talking about. I wasn't there. No, I'm not him."" And her saying ""Yes, you're him. You look too much like him not to be him."" Then the rest of the book refers to the hero over and over again as having been the bachelor at the auction! Very confusing! A cute story that had a lot of potential, but was very purely executed, and somehow all these errors it got past an editor without being caught."
2,Died after 5 months,I purchased the Panasonic NN-T764SF microwave in June of 2004 and it stopped working this past weekend (October 2004). Other than it being dead... while it was working it didn't seem to have the power output that it states. My previous microwave was a lower wattage but it heated items much faster... maybe it's because the cubic footage is a little larger???
2,I was about to make some popcorn when.....,Wow! Had for only three months and it quit. Reminds me of some old girlfriends I dated. Last Panasonic item I will buy. The store I got it from indicted this was a popular item. For returns maybe.
2,Lasted 14 months,This is a great oven while it lasted.Unfortunately mine suffered a suddendeath after 14 months of light use.I used to believe in the Panasonicbrand name. Now I have to think twicebefore buying Panasonic again.
3,"Ze Clasps, They Do Nuzzing","I had this for a little less than a month when the spring that locks the door clasps into place decided to come loose. The product wasn't too bad overall, but I agree with the previous reviewer about the power rating being a bit misleading."
5,Quality,"I bought 3 of these large Forstner Bits. Quality items. They produce clean, smooth cuts in both solid wood and plywood."
2,good for one project,bit looked used and was of inferior materials (when compared with more expensive units)...you get what you pay for...one time project use just fine...not a lifetime tool....nor for precision wokr
1,Not from China,"I purchased the Steelex D1020 2-1/2"" Forstner drill bit, from Peachtree Woodworking Supply through Amazon. I tried to use this bit on soft pine with my drill press. It would not cut and jammed up the drill press. I sent it back to the company for a refund. The shipping both ways cost more than the bit it self. In the future I recommend that anyone purchasing tools on the internet make sure that they are not made in China and that the company will cover the charge for return shipping.Toolman"
2,"Decent sound, poorly made.",The sound on these earbuds is wonderful. I had them for nearly two months and noticed one ear was getting lower and lower in volume. Then suddenly they both quit working. This is very little support between the earpiece and the cord going to your Ipod. Putting them on and taking them off causes too much stress and the wires inside detach rendering the headphones useless.
2,The Incredible Disintegrating Earbuds,"I have owned this product for over a year and up until the past few months was very satisfied with my purchase. The sound from these earbuds is very crisp and they fit into the ear easily and comfortably. They also do an outstanding job of cutting out exterior sounds (which can be both a good thing and a bad thing). However, as I've seen from other reviewers, over time the casing begins to fall apart exposing the wiring in the cable. I now have around 7 or 8 areas on the cable that are showing exposed wire and can feel several other areas where the casing is going to start to split. I have seen other reviewers comment that this problem may be limited to the white version of these earbuds so if you are not concerned with your earbuds matching your iPod I'd recommend looking into one of the other Fontopia models."
2,Great Sound BUT Broke in a MONTH,"Buy the 51LP, those last longer, not sure about white ones, but my friend has a 51LP black one that he has used for a year now, I checked it out, the wires are better as in tougher and there's a plastic clasp holding the wires together instead of a sharp metal one that comes with this product, plus the wires for this product are not tough, instead they are nice and soft which is meaningless to me for earphones. I don't care if my earphones' wires are nice and soft, make them tough instead."
3,Make them tougher,"I'd owned a previous model of the Sony Fontopia headphones and lost one of the rubber pieces for the earbud. So instead of trying to search everywhere for a replacement one I decided to get the newest model since I had the old ones for awhile. I love how these fit, they have a good sound (yes they're not perfect but then they only cost like $[...]). However, I despise the different length cords for the right and left ears and they don't hold up worth a crap. I use my ipod at night to help me go to sleep and I've torn the heck out of these things (my old ones didn't do this). The covering on the cord has worn off and I have exposed wires in numerous places, but these things are still kicking and working fine. So to the sony folks, make the shell a little tougher because these things fit perfect in my ears and I'd hate to have to search for another comfortable pair of earbuds."
4,Good licorice,"These are good. They are chewy, but the taste is good overall. An excellent, natural option if you like licorice."
4,Not for beginners,"This book offers beautifully designed doll clothing patterns and advice about sewing for dolls in general. However, it is not for beginners as it gives a minimum of construction information. It would have been nice if the smocking designs had been included, but they are not.All in all, it is a beautiful book that will stimulate your imagination to sew for your dolls. It does offer patterns in several useful sizes so that you can make a complete wardrobe for several of your dolls."
4,Rugged but smaller than advertised,"First, this thing is built. It's four parts: stainless steel screwcap, stainless steel capsule body, steel triangle ring, and a rubber o-ring. The cap and the body are each milled from single pieces of stainless steel - there are no glued end fittings, or joints that could debond or leak. This probably could have kept pills dry after being pulled up from the Titanic. It has no paint or surface coatings to fleck off and contaminate your drugs. The one downside is that the interior diameter is 11.5 mm (measured with calipers), not 12 mm as advertised. 12-mm diameter tablets, of which there are many, will _just_ not fit. It can fit one 1,100-mg fish oil pill and many others, but measure your meds to make sure they're at most 11-mm wide. My prescription medicine (a fairly common one) was 12 mm. Otherwise, a perfect pill fob."
5,expensive but the only good one around,I've checked many and most are made of plastic or cheap metal coated with metallic paint. It's not a healthy idea to store pills in plastic or paint that will experience roughness or change of temperature going out and in. Pills can absorb some of the micro plastic or paint particles coming off making your medication less than pure.This is the only genuine medical grade safe stainless steel pill container small enough for my pocket. It won't contain larger wide pills and may hold a single long one. It can hold about 8 of my small thyroid pills although I only carry 2 at a time.The rubber seal and key chain ring are well constructed too.
5,Nice to have,It does a good job. It's nice to be able to figure out the electrical usage of different products in the house whether it's on or off. You would be surprised what some things draw even when turned off.
1,Spent more money than I saved,"I purchased and used the ez watt until it burned out in about three months. I tried to contact the company with no luck. I may have had a lemon. But in the end, I lost more money than I saved. I threw it out. I'm glad to see that others have had a better experience."
4,Power Meter Works Great!,Great product. Works well. Would like to have a light to read the meter in the dark. It would be a great feature if it had a way to stream the data so it can be recorded and graphed. The biggest difficulty is that it is too big to plug in a second item into a standard two outlet fixture.No matter it does what it says it will do and is very easy to use.
5,Electrifing,"They sell these products at Home Depot, Lowes, Menards ect. However for a couple $$ less you can find it on Amazon.com and have it delivered to you, sometimes at no additional cost. After reading directions, I immeadiately started checking on various appliances to see what uses what. But mostly got it to find out how much I could save by installing my solar panels and grid tie inverter directly to the house. On the average I estimate about 5 to 10$ per month. Only have a 250 watt grid tie inverter. 5$ in the winter monthes & 10$ in the summer monthes. Not bad for a small set up. Plan on expanding. Good luck with your projects. Tony from Indy"
1,P3 Kill A Watt,I do not like device. Some of the buttons do not work. The wattage function does not respond. The socket into which you plug the equipment is not right--it's hard to plug into. Nice looking but no good.
1,Screen keeps falling off...no help from manufacture getting it fixed or replaced,"The screen keeps falling off exposing the LCD display. I've email P3 several times and have received no response. My next step is to contact Amazon for help with the situation. Due to the lack of customer service from the manufacture, I give this product only one star."
4,Electricity Usage Monitor,"This product is easy to use and provides useful information for energy-conscious consumers. It shows the actual energy usage & cost for any 120v appliance. For instance, I found that my TV/Cable Box combination used more energy than the refrigerator! You can also use it to compare the energy usage of CFL (compact flourescent) bulbs vs standard incandescent bulbs (and yes CFL's do use much less energy).The only issue I found is that you can't use this device to monitor 208/220v appliances (such as electric stoves, water heaters & clothes dryers). These are probably the highest usage appliances in the average house. To be fair, the monitor is neither designed nor advertised for this purpose.Overall however, I would certainly recommend this device."
5,"Slick Unit, Easy to Use","The P3 Kilo-A-Watt unit is very easy to use and helped me understand the energy usage in my house.I had a De-humidifier that was using up to $48/Month!My spare freezer in the garage is using $7/Month.My electric motorcycle uses less than $.01/mile (see www.schultzengineering.us/ebike.htm).Some people said it was hard to see the display, but I had no problems reading it because I plugged the P4460 into a power strip, an extension cord into the P4460, and the appliance being monitored into the extension cord.Also, the unit retains the cost per Kilowatt hour when unplugged so it doesn't need to be reprogrammed between each use as another reviewer indicated."
1,Might be good if it functioned,"After two units had malfunctioning keys Amazon (rightly) decided that it was likely to happen again. I will wait until another batch comes through perhaps I will have better luck.BTW: Cudos to Amazon for having a painless (and cost free) way to return defective products, 5 stars for Amazon."
1,Dont Buy.,"I may be returning this thing.The hardware MAY ? be OK ..... dunno...but the user interface is VERY crudeand clumsy and erratic.So it's hard to say if it's worth theeffort to troubleshoot the thing or not.Meanwhile I dug out an old clamp-onstyle AC ammeter, made a little split-wireAC extension cord for it and quickly measuredthe current drain of all my computer stuffand my wall-warts, in various states ofon-off-asleep-standby-etc..... and quicklycame up with an arrangement of multi outletpowerstrips which allows me to save a fewwatt-hours of our vanishing energy storefor the use of my kids.I wanted to do that with the Kill-a-Watt butfound it not so easy to get working soabandoned the effort.Sorry."
3,Needs a battery,"Works as it says, but badly needs a battery back-up and a back-light. The second you unplug it, it loses all the data and you have to reprogram it. It is also hard to read, so pick up a pen light to read it with."
1,Kill a Watt,"Works ok, effectively measured most of my electric use. I was only really interested in the wattage/amperage. A few days after I received it, I found the identical product at Costco for $27, but of course by then I already had one...Update: about 2 weeks later the LCD burned out rendering the device useless. So I let it sit for a year, still doesn't work so it now goes to the e-waste bin..."
4,Nice product with a few flaws (Beware - not supplied in retail packaging),We decided to purchase this power monitor (P4460) because of the advanced feature but as other mentioned it really needs a backlit display and offline powered display for easy use. It does functions very well so I would recommend it highly. I will also caution you that Amazon ships a unit in a brown box not a retail packaged unit. I'm not sure if it is refurbished or not but it is definatley not a retail unit. This should have been mention since we were originally buying it as a gift but due to packaging decided to use it in house instead. Way to go Amazon! Even with the few minor flaws it works great and you will be amazed what different devices cost to run annually. Items we thought were very low actually cost a lot while others we unplugged actually cost very little. This is a great device to add to any tool box.
4,Solid Product,"Great product. It is very simple, so don't expect it to perform computations or anything, but it will easily tell you how much electricity a device or appliance is pulling."
5,This does exactly what we hoped it would,This is a great tool to tell which devices in your home use the most energy. It has changed the way we live!
3,Kill A Watt,"Seems to work fine, but as others have mentioned it only allows you to plug one item into an outlet plate because it covers both outlets when plugged in. This is a design flaw."
3,Good product,"The absence of a back-lit lcd and a hard to see lcd if the lighting isn't just right disappointed me with this product. They certainly could have done better. Add the extra cost compared to similar products and all that's left to pay for is the accuracy. As measured against a 50,000 count Fluke 189, I've found all of the similar meters have the same accuracy. For that reason I rate this product low, not because of any lack of functionality, it does everything you need. Just cost more, and has no back light. They really should have designed in a 3 cent led."
4,Works as advertised but needs backlight LCD,This device works. So far in every situation where I want to read it while measuring measuring I have to take a flashlight. You can also minumize this problem with a short extension cord. At this price they really should have a backlight. It's not like it going eat battery power.
5,Worthwhile product,"I bought 25 of these for my science classroom. Every one of them came out of the package working as described. Two had lose screens but that was easily remedied. They have worked well in a rough classroom setting for a month now, with students taking them home and coming back with interesting results."
4,It served my purpose,"Many years ago you had to rent a similar item from the local electric company in order to measure the electrical usage of an item. It gave a paper readout of the results. (Note: You waited on a list; had it for a week and it cost $1500.00 to replaced if not returned it in proper condition)The P4460 measured the electrical usage over a one week period, which is what I was looking for, and I could see the current usage at any point during the test. I was easy to setup and easy to read. Even better; it can do so much more.I am very pleased with this device"
4,calculations done for you! great info,"I love that once you enter your rate, it gives you the costs so easily. Also for an always on item, after just one hour you can get a good idea of how much it costs to run (tv etc). I hooked it up to an extra fridge i have running and in just 1 day it gave me the annual cost of 38 bucks to run. I let it on about 2 more days to be sure and yes, that 38 was right on.Definitely spend the money for a longer heavy duty extension cord so you most easily check the data. And the readings sure are dim so make sure you carry a flashlight in dim rooms. I found out it's costing me only 50 cents a day to run my AC unit. Very much worth my comfort!this is a great unit and easy to use!"
1,Kill-a-Watt: Have not recieved yet !,"It seemed like a good thing to be able to check how much power is being used..I wish I could use it.. I ordered it Dec 6,, they said expect a Dec11 delivery.. that was last week.Still waiting. It appears to have gotten shipped quickly, but I think the problem is the carrier: Smart Post.I never heard of SmartPost.. but I am finding it isn't smart to depend on SmartPost.I am sure the product is fine and will give a better rating if SmartPost ever shows up."
5,Great for determining your energy use,I've been very happy with this product. I have been using it on various items throughout the house to determine what my monthly and annual cost is for each electric item. Did you know your computer will typically cost you $10/month if you leave it on 24/7?
4,Fun Device,"This is one of thous things that you can live very will with out, but if you are wondering what an appliance costs you to run, then this is a amazing little tool. After you program into it the cost you pay per kilowatt, an easy job, it will calculate for you what you are paying to run that appliance per hour, day, week, month, and year. I got mine after I had bought a infrared heater, but that is another story. The only con that I can see is that it works only for 110 volts and can't be used for 220."
4,Nice Way to find where your money is going,"P4460 WORKS GREAT, wish it had a battery so you could read results without having it plugged in,does store info temporarily when unplugged so you can move to a different outlet for reading results."
4,"Useful, Works","This unit is useful and works as spec'd. However it needs some usability improvements:- LCD needs more legibility - provide backlighting and larger lettering for units of measurements (KWH etc); Perhaps just 'raising' the LCD out of the display 'window well' would help legibility.- Needs a 'detachable' power cable instead of a fixed 3-prong. I'd suggest the standardized cable/connector approaches of a PC or the AC adapter/power supply of laptops. The first thing a user must do currently, with this unit is to hunt for a safe and proper extension cord - i.e. it is not quite plug and play!- Needs to be ruggedized - along the lines of the Reliance Amwatt Appliance Load Tester; all the shoving, stretching and drops behind bulky appliances can't be too good for its reliability and lifespan."
5,electricity monitor,This is a great product. Plug it in and it works. I have created a monster with my husband who is using it on everything in the house from electric blankets to the refrigerator. It is very interesting to see what uses the most electricity (and money!)
3,but after a while....,"I was bored after a while of using it....it is in usd and not in the currency of my country, but this is not a problem....but it could include currency or a multiplier..."
4,P446P0 the right choice,"Have yet to set the rate correctly, been monetoring for less than a month, already feel this particular P3 is going to be indispencible, this model is worth the extra cost for it’s ability to caculate cost as it’s name implies EZ is what I wanted,"
5,"Works as advertised, great analytical tool","Gives you all the information about your electrical use. I have it plugged in somewhere every day! I may leave it it plugged into somewhere for a week or two, but in 100 weeks of ownership, it has sat idle for maybe two. It has truley helped me to use LESS electricity! Average home in the U.S. anually uses 8,900 KWH, since owning this, it has helped me reduce to 7,600 KWH. The unit certainly has paid off. But more importantly, it shows me what is really happening in my house."
3,Inadequate display,"The display on this device is absolutely unreadable except in bright light. It has next to no visual contrast (black on dark grey), and very small lettering for the units being monitored. It's like a '70's style geek digital watch face (I had one of those). Now that we're in the 21st century, it should have an LED display, or some back lighting. Even Timex has figured out how to solve this problem.The meter reads what it's supposed to and, as everyone has said, is easier to use with an extension cord. I'm on a mission to find our power hogs, and we're trying to decide whether a new fridge would be worth the expense, so this device will be a big help for us. It's great that you can enter your own utility rates."
1,"Before your buy, look for a better one","Hard to read. you have to get down on your knees to see it, if it would work. Look around for better one"
4,WORKHORSE OF ENERGY AUDITING,"There are several versions of this meter. I own them all and I RECOMMEND THIS VERSION--THE ""EZ' VERSION. The other popular version, the 4400, is slightly cheaper but does not project monthly and annual costs.Positives of this meter:- Instantly displays power consumption- Tracks cumulative consumption- Projects monthly and annual consumption- Measures VA and power factor (for advanced users)Negatives:- User interface is not always intuitive- Not accurate below 3 Watts. When checking standby power use theP3 International P4480 Kill A Watt Electricity Usage Monitor with Electronic Graphic Timerwhich is more expensive and more complex to use, but is accurate to 1/10th of a watt."
3,"Works fine, but....","The product works fine and for the money is a good deal, however, the plastic faceplate on mine fell off (a little scotch tape did the trick)and it would be easier to use if it had a backlight. That being said, it's probably just the glue on this one that went bad on the face plate because the other four of them my company has have had no such problem. The lack of a back light though, makes you need to use a flashlight when you use it in tight quarters or under desks. I'd gladly pay another $5 -$10 if it had a backlight. Good devive though and pretty fast when you use it right. Not hard to learn either.Wayne"
1,burnt out in 27 days,It was great when it lasted. Had it plugged in for nearly a month with an aveage load of about 300watts going through it. Kept it plugged in for the avearging feature. Longer you leave it in the more accurate it calculates your true energy cost. One night had about 900watts going through it and it burnt up. Its rated for 1500. It was hot and you could smell the burnt circuitry and the device it was plugged into went out. Unfortunately I just missed the return window. Was great otherwise wish i still had it.
1,Inaccurate. No amp display. Finally died. Junk,"This one is not accurate. I have compared it against several high quality meters at work, and the 4460 is always off, but often by a different direction or a different amount.I miss the display in amps the older model had. It was very useful for determining circuit loads in cases where an amp clamp was not convenient.It also hogs both outlets of a standard duplex receptacle, so the other one is covered and unusable. (Yes, a pigtail would help)I e mailed the company twice about the inaccuracy and inconsistency, and did not receive a reply.It became more and more inaccurate and finally died."
5,Easy to use and informational,"I purchased the Kill a watt EZ to monitor my computers and stereo equipment since I tend to leave it on 24/7. It provides information on not only how much power the device is consuming, but also on the quality of the power being delivered to the device. The ability to enter your electric meter rate is another great feature that can project out how much the unit will cost per hour/day/week/month/year. I would definitely recommend this item and I believe it makes a great gift for any geek!"
1,not consistent,"The meter is not consistent, the rates can vary to greatly. My opinion - save your money on this meter and buy a smart strip instead. Buy only a smart strip for PC computers(towers,monitors speakers,etc.) to save money. It doesn't save me money with my imac!! They save about $10.00 a month on my entertainment center(tv,surround system,dvd,vhs,sub woofer,satellite radio, amp, sub woofer)."
2,"Frustrating design, poorly made","Poorly made... mine had a defective LCD display right out of the package.Bad design - because of the way they shaped the device, it will cover BOTH of the outlets in a standard wall socket. Had they moved the plug part on the back an EIGHTH of an inch lower, it would have been fine, leaving the other outlet free. Incredibly frustrating... want to measure one device when there's two things plugged into an outlet? Sorry, you're out of luck... you have to move other devices to other outlets in your room which can be really inconvenient, if not impossible.And as others have pointed out, it's virtually impossible to read the UNLIT display... and it goes blank when you pull it out of the wall since they didn't include a battery backup.All-in-all, a very frustrating product not worth the money."
5,Really Great Product,Extreemly valuable home improvement and trouble shooting tool.Check appliances and circuits for correct draw and deterioation.Well worth the price
4,very simple to use,"does just as discribed, very simple to set up and use.shows just how much something is costing to run by min,day,month year."
3,Not Good for Low Power Items,This item seems to work ok for larger wattage equipment. I tried it on a power charger for a cell phone and a camera battery charger. It didn't register any kWH or any any $ for these items. Dissapointing.
4,kill a watt,"Good product. When they say ""any"" appliance they mean one that uses less than 15 amps. Nowhere in the description does it mention this limitation. Buy a flashlight and a power strip for optimum performance. Keep instructions handy."
5,Kill A Watt P4460 works great!,"Works better than expected. This is a great tool to see what is going on around the house. I was surprised to see our 50"" plasma uses an average of 450 watts when its on. I guess we'll be getting an LED/LCD tv next time. Its easy to cycle though cost estimates hour/day/week/year and also cycle though actual loads watts/amps/hz/volts, etc. It would be nice if you could read it when its not plugged in, but it does remember your last settings/estimates until you press ""reset"""
4,P4460 Kill A Watt EZ Electricity Usage Monitor,The monitor worked very well. I identified that the dehumidifier was causing our electric bill to be high. We bought a new dehumidifier that used 40% less electricity.
4,Saving us money right out of the box,"We purchased this in an attempt to weed out which appliances are causing our electric bill to rise. It takes a little practice and some time interpreting the instruction manual, but it is worth it to see exactly what each item is costing on an hourly, daily, weekly, etc. basis. I would have given it 5 stars except for the fact that it can be very inconvenient to plug things into it. The prongs on the back are positioned in such a way as to take up the entire outlet cover, so anything else plugged in has to be removed first. This would be many times more user friendly if it had a short section of cord on the back so it could be plugged in and still positioned in such a way as to be more viewable too. You have to get down eye level with wherever it is plugged in to read its results because as soon as you unplug it the display goes blank."
4,"Not the most brilliant user interface, but it works","You'll actually have to read the documentation to figure out the buttons, and that's not great, but it performs as advertised. A lot of effort goes into explaining how to use it to get average power readings on devices that cycle over time, and if that's your thing you'll find this useful -- if not, you'll find the documentation a bit in your way, actually.Note that the (3-prong) plug is built directly into the unit, making it like an ultra-large powerblock, so it will be VERY difficult to plug into power strips or other tight places. Still, I like having it available."
4,Good product,"After hearing so much about standby power we bought this just to see what was happening at our house. I found some surprising things like the home theater receiver on standby costs us 3.00 a month, the router and modem cost around 2.50 and the computer being on adds only about 70 cents. Surprising to me. Anyhow, I guess by unplugging the receiver I can save $36 a year and pay for this meter.Overall, I like the meter, it does what it's supposed to and inputting the electric rate saves a little math."
3,"Useful, practical","This Kill A Watt Monitor gives me the data which I was looking for. I use it to check my personal appliances and electronics. My use is simple and I have nothing to compare it to, so I give it a good rating. It could us a back light on the monitor for convenience."
5,I'm saving money,"I'm saving money by turning off hardware I used to leave in standby mode. Easy to follow directions to view your results and input the per kilowatt price your utility charges for electricity. Its quite useful to prove to someone they are overloading a circuit with an item. It was interesting to see the number of watts go up as the volume of your stereo amplifier goes up. I'm blessed with relatively cheap electricity (peak rate of 9.5 cents/kw) and even at that, my TV entertainment center (two game consoles, DVR, Receiver and LED TV) racked up $2/day when viewing for 6 hours. I recommend it to others who want see where your $$ are going and if it pays to replace with more energy efficient technology."
4,Very good product,It works as advertised. This is a very good quality product. Mine has been working fine for many many years.
3,Good power monitoring tools,"If you wanted to know your energy usage for a specific equipment, this is the tool you need. Hope they come up with a higher rating."
3,"Accurate readings, simple operation","I can read down to the penny what each of my electrical devices is costing me per month etc.I would have given this device a five star if could also measure my 220V devices, which it can't . This is a pitty"
4,Nice but some flaws,"I really like these power meters, but some of them are not very accurate. I have tried 3 P4460s and several of the cheaper models and found that one of the P4460s read 86 watts when it should have been 80. That's off by 7.5% and is way out of spec according to the manual (which says it is suppose to have .5% to 2% accuracy). I am returning that unit (the replacement I bought reads 83 watts which is better). Some of the other units were off too, but not by as much. Otherwise this is a nice unit but could include an optional short power cable which makes it much easier to handle and use. I like the fact that this unit does not lose readings when power is lost."
1,Only good for 115-125 volts,"For something that was touted as being ""international,"" I was surprised to find out that it can only accept a maximum of 125 VAC, which would render it useless in other countries where the appliances are predominantly 220-240 VAC."
2,Kill a Watt,"I was very disappointed. I used with several items and got the readings I was looking for. Lots of potential. Then, I plugged in a small personal sized heater and the KAW outlet started melting. I have written to the manufacturer several times including pictures of the defective unit. ABSOLUTELY no response. I can not recommend this item."
2,Smells burned out right from the package,"The item arrived today. It has a electrical burnt smell right without even using it. I pluged it in to the wall and tried a coffee maker. I could hardly get the coffee machine plug into the device. Then I had trouble getting the coffee plug out of the device.I did use the device to check the coffee maker's electrical use. Even with the coffee maker shut off it was registering a 3.3 watt draw. The machine was totally off so I think the device must be faulty. I also thought I saw a short extension (6"") that was in the picture of the item. There was none in the package.I will update my review in a month."
2,novalty.. not really useful in my opinion,"I got it to see if things I kept on were a drain and costly. It's not as useful as you would expect and usability if not great from an interface perspective. now after 1 day of use, mine will sit in a box with other gadgets."
4,Great for monitoring usage!,This usage monitor is perfect for those that want to keep track of how much they're spending by keeping that machine plugged in. I've quickly dropped my monthly electric bill by 25% just by shutting down the power hungry gadgets over night and while I'm at work. You'd be amazed at how much you're spending by running your electronics 24/7! Get a handle on how much by investing in this monitor.The only downside is that my monitor had false readings on it after about a month. Even when nothing was plugged into it the usage would increase. After a quick email w/ the company they sent me a new one free of charge and it works good as new. I'm always lending this monitor out to friends.
4,"Useful, but not perfect","Very useful for determining the amount of energy used by major appliances. I like the fact that it keeps track of total energy consumption and uses the actual energy cost to forecast the cost of operation. This information is very useful when targeting appliances to reduce energy consumption. It is also useful for evaluating how successful I am at reducing energy consumption.I don't like the fact that the LCD does not have a backlight, and that the display can only be read while the unit is plugged in. I have to get on the floor to read it. The unit also blocks both outlets.I recommend getting a couple of extension cords and using this device ""in line"". Use one cord from the kill-a-watt to the wall, so that it's easier to read, then another cord from the kill-a-watt to your appliance (not needed if your appliance has a long enough cord)."
4,Very Helpful Tool,This is probably one of the most interesting tools I have ever bought. I learn something new with it everyday. Very easy to setup and use. The only thing holding me back from a 5 star review is the design. It pretty much requires exclusive use of both plugs (due to the shape) in a standard gang outlet box. So I highly recommend getting a short jumper cable (they sell all kinds of them for plugging AC adapters ... aka wall warts ... into power strips) just get a high quality one that uses lower gauge wire and you shouldnt have any problems.
3,Kill A Watt Usage monitor Model P4460,"If you owe model P4400, probably that is all you need functionally. You can figure out the rate, consumption etc. yourself and log it out in a note book.It concume about 3 watt. I did not detect any consumption in P4400 ( may be <<< 1 watt. The specs list 10 Wmax as power concumption in model P4460."
1,OPPS D.O.A.,This thing worked for less than 30 days and then died. It's now cost me $4.13 to send it back for an exchange.
3,"I am sorry for -2 stars, but absense of screen backlight is unforgiveable","minus two stars for the absence of backlighting on screen. I might even return this product, because it is a pure headache to use it with LCD burried so deep under the glass and having no backlit. Very huge flaw. Other that that seems to work fine."
5,Works well!,This product does what it is supposed to do. Very easy to use so I recommend it to anyone who wants to keep track of their energy use.
4,Very Pleased,Everything came in a timely manner as stated when I orderd. Very Please with the order! I would order again from them!Marie
4,Kill A Watt Monitor,"I bought this for my daughter. She moved to a townhouse apartment and her first electric bill was $55. After her boyfriend moved in, it skyrocketed to nearly $300. He swears it has nothing to do with the fact he never turns off a light, leaves a space heater running even when he's not home, and has enough computer and game peripherals to start a small store.I plugged it into my computer's power strip as a baseline test. I liked being able to scroll through the different readings. I didn't like where the display was located. My option was to either get down on the floor to see it or use an additional power cord that I could move to a more usable position. I did the latter.My daughter hasn't given me the results yet, but I have no doubts about what the Kill A Watt will reveal about the boyfriend."
4,Kill A Watt EZ P4460,"KILL A WATT EZ This devise is simple to use and does a great job if you are trying to get a handle on electric consumption and operating cost for various appliances, heaters, light sources etc.Only one minor critism I have is, when plugging the devise into an outlet since it is a 3 prong plug, the position of the wall receptical creates a problem reading the KILL A WATT digital meter because it could be in an upside down, horizontal, or vertical position making it hard to view the readings. My suggestion is to purchase a short pig tail extention which will allow you to read the meter with ease."
2,P3 International P4460 EZ Electricity Usage Meter,"This meter probably works fine for your small appliances. I purchased it to evaluate my heavy usage appliances such as refrigerators, air conditioners and to my dismay many of my heavy usage appliances such as dryer, A/C's have different plugs so the Monitor simply is of no value as it will not plug into the outlets."
3,P4460 product OK; packaging dangerous,"This is a useful and easy to use product for monitoring energy use and costs for home appliances. Everyone should have such a product and use it to find easy ways to cut electricity use (and reduce CO2 emissions from gas/coal electricity generation). However, the P3 International P4460 is packaged in hard clear plastic, and the package is difficult to open without getting your hand/finger cut on the sharp edges. Hence, I consider this packaging dangerous and cannot recommend the P4460 until the packaging is changed. I wrote to the company about this problem and got no response. My lower rating reflects my concern on the packaging safety issue."
3,not what I thought,This product is really easy to use. I gave it a three because in my mind I should be able to plug this into the wall and then plug whatever into this (we will say a coffee pot). I think you should be able to instantly see how much it will cost you but if you read the directions it says that the longer you keep something plugged into this unit the more accurate the reading will be. It doesn't even give you an amount of time. So now I can't even be sure how much money something is costing me because I have no clue how long it needs to be plugged in for in order for the reading to be accurate. Very dissapointing and will try to return this product.
4,Nice features,"Nice features and very helpful in determining energy consumption around the home. I would have given it a 5, but to get the information it needs to be plugged in-there is no battery on board and the outlet may be behind the appliance, so you will need a three pronged extension cord to monitor or get your information."
4,Needs a Backlight,"This device does what it says, showing extrapolated monthly cost of operating various appliances. Unfortunately, its dark display is difficult to read and set up when you've plugged it into an outlet just a foot off the floor behind a desk.A version that had a backlight, and preferably was on a short cord, would be a better choice."
4,Great unit. NEEDS A BACKLIGHT !,"First, This unit does exactly what it says and delivery could not have been faster. Having said that, there are a couple things I would like to add: This unit did not come with any instructions. I tried my best to work it out but finally had to go online and read the manual to find-out how to reset the $/KWH, etc. It would have been much less frustrating if I had of known this beforehand. I would still have bought it but I would have arrived home (where I am not connected to the INET) knowing how to operate it. Also THIS UNIT NEEDS A BACKLIGHT. MFG TAKE NOTICE! I know there is a remote reading unit but it was too much money for me."
3,Tough to read the screen,"Works as advertised. Great device for identifying the power draw of your electronic devices and appliances. I would give it 4 stars, but the screen was a bit difficult to read."
5,Works great!,"Device does what it says and is easy to use. Minor glitches include difficulty reading it if the outlet is low or behind furniture (use extension cord) and the low end resolution of 0.1W. This is OK for most things, but some nightlights read 0 power while the light is on. Overall very useful!"
4,P4460 Kill A Watt EZ Electricity Usage Monitor,"Good, accurate product when it works. Mine was not packed properly and arrived with a damaged power plug. Once fixed it works well."
1,Vegetarian Feast,"I never received this book, so I can't comment on it. I was pleased that my card was quickly credited by Amazon."
2,Not really what I was expecting,This book only has a bunch of questions - very little study material about the career field. I was wanting both.
1,"Title Was Great, Book Not Helpful","This book advertised with great promise. What it really does is rehash the difference between traditional American Medicine (pill pushing, basically) and alternative (or ancient) treatments. If you don't know about certain types of alternative medicine, this might be ok for you. For me, it was a waste of time and money.I'm sure the author's heart is in the right place though."
5,Excellent Resource,"I've had FMS for over 7 years and have read a lot of books and material. Even though it is an older book, it was way ahead of its time. It's a lot of information to digest, and gets into some specifics about different things. I thing it's an excellent compliment to any fibromyalgics library."
4,Taboo Issue in Indian Cinema,"Silsila was made in 1981 and it has the all star cast - Jaya Bachan, Amitabh Bachan, Rekha and Shammi Kapoor. I rented this movie because the songs were really nice. I had just seen Kabhi Kushi Kabhi Gham a couple of days ago and Jaya Bachan is unrecognizable in this movie.Amitabh Bachan and Shammi Kapoor are brothers in this movie. There are different love angles in this movie. Basically the movie deals with the issue of adultery which is not talked about openly in India even though it does occur. The movie is 3 hours long but it holds the viewer's attention with the different twists the movie makes. Personally, I didn't agree with some decisions made in the movie, but this movie was still enjoyable overall."
3,A Good TRUE METAL Album,"Probably 3.5 stars. I think this is a fun release. True metal played well with candy and a vocalist that sounds similar to Steve Grimmett of the classic metal band Grim Reaper. Some songs are better than others with a few standout tracks which is nice. This is big chorus true metal of the tra,la,la Hammerfall sort with typical warrior, metal forever type lyrics. Overall you get what you pay for here. Well worth the money but certainly not groundbreaking stuff. I personally have the version with the bonus track but it is nothing special so if there is a price difference puchase the regular version with no fear of missing anything special."
1,Uninformed garbage,"I am only commenting on the NZ content - van Dorp consistently gets Maori words wrong; is part of a teensy tiny feeble (in the rationality stakes) group of weirdos here, and has zilch standing in our land. His opus is - ho dear, so badly written that I dont want to waste time lambasting it. This is an author so up himself he'll spend pages describing his [] problems and then ascribe them & his [] predatoriness to a planet-wide root chakra problem.Avoid this like an haemorrhoid-"
1,"What's the opposite of ""mastering"" a recording?","Please, save yourself the frustration. Buy a different recording of the Rhapsody. Each variation in this one is introduced by the music fading-out then fading back in again. Who would think to do such a thing? For me this trumps all positives (and negatives) of the performance."
1,Over the top and self-indulgent,"For all of the hype he has received, Lang Lang has (at best) a spotty track record when it comes to recorded performances. Perhaps he is a more compelling performer in a live concert setting, but we provincials wouldn't know about that & are forced to rely on the recorded medium. It appears that Lang Lang is beginning to believe the hyperbole of his own press & has decided to abandon any pretence of having depth & nuance. All we have here is self-indulgence & caricature.Gergiev, who seems to be gravitating towards more extreme tempi & dynamics every time I hear newer recordings of his, does nothing to rein in Lang Lang and simply allows him to run amok. The result is a ridiculous & unlistenable recording. Don't buy into the hype --- this sucks."
3,amateurish performance,"There is no doubt that Lang Lang can play the piano, but heis not the thoughtful, mature pianist that we would expectfrom someone being touted by DG records as being the ""nextgreat pianist"". If he plays the violin, he'd be more aptto be called a 'fiddler' than a 'violinist'. The best recordingof these works (Rachmanninoff's 2nd piano concerto andthe Paganini Rhapsody variations) is that of Cecile Licadon CBS Masterworks. Licad's reading is most emotionallyintense yet highly intellectual, her playing virtuosic yet highlycontrolled. Too bad, Licad does not record that much; sheprobably dislikes the limelight like other great musicians.In contrast Lang Lang obviously loves to bask in the limelight."
2,Style over Substance,"Listen to Lang Lang and then listen to the great Artur Rubinstein playing the same pieces with the Chicago Symphony conducted by Fritz Reiner. Listening to Rubinstein's transcendent playing one is deeply moved, while when listening to Lang Lang one hears the pianist playing mere notes however competently. In the Rubinstein recording the pianist and orchestra dance together, in the Lang Lang recording they may as well have been playing at different times in different places. Hard to believe Lang Lang is a star after listening to this."
2,"Amateurish, style over substance",This pianist is painful to watch and boring to hear. We can only hope he is not the idol of a new generation of classical music listeners. It would be a bad omen for the future ....
1,Not good at all,"This is just bad, amateurish, silly playing. I have heard pianists in second rate competitions play better. Lang Lang lacks any depth when playing Rachmaninov and has no intensity whatsoever. Some of the tempi make your blood boil. Lang Lang thinks he can just play around with Rachmaninov and turn it into some type of Jazz improvisation. Time is a scarce commodity these days and this will be a compounded waste at that. This is one of the most popular concertos and maestros from the four corners have studied and played this. Maybe Lang Lang should consider composing an adaptation to Palestrinas choral music for piano. That way he will have the luxury of playing a piece and not being compared to anyone else. In fact the only way Lang Lang could obtain 5 stars is if you compare him to the 99.9 percent of the population that could not play this in the first piece. Although that is a humorous proposition all in all this is complete trash."
2,I have given up hope listening to Lang Lang again,"Shame on Deutsche Grammophon to have promoted aggressively such an incoherent pianist like Lang Lang. Yellow label is just not yellow any more from the way DG has promoted Lang Lang. I don't have to wait for Lang Lang to be more mature to listen to him again as I know if one is not musically mature at his age, he will remain that way forever."
5,None,WOW. I love everything I have read of Ms. Lowell's but this is the most sensual book I have had the pleasure to read.
2,Fever,"Fever - The story is very predicable,. .. I would not recommend it in general, even to Elizabeth Lowell regular readers,"
4,Outstanding author,"I've never had a book by Elizabeth Lowell, that was not thrilling, and never want to put it down until it is finished. MARY"
1,1988 passed off as 2012,"Could not believe I was taken in again by a book that was so old being passed off as one written in 2012. Why does Amazon do this? Complete waste of money, could not be bothered to even read when I realized what was going on. This book is over 20 years old! Soooooo disappointing!"
3,steamy fairy-tale,This was the first book that I have read by Elizabeth Lowell. It reminded me of a cinderella story in many ways. In the beginning I thought that Rye was a bit tough on Lisa but as the story unfolded I realized that some of that toughness was masked by his insecurities and hurts. This had more graphic love scenes than I usually like to read but they were more sensual than they were sexual. I wouldn't rate this as one of the best books that I have read but I have read much worse. It was an easy and quick read and rather entertaining.
4,"A light/quick read, but I enjoyed it","I liked Chris from Utah's review. Yes, it was unrealistic, but I really liked Lisa. I liked all the characters. Too bad there isn't a book about Rye's sister and brother. I would definitely purchase. A keeper."
3,r is for redundant,"while this book has some nice touches, it really does not have enough themes to take it through the alphabet and it a little more religious than the name implies."
1,This is only for very Christian two parent families,"H is for ""Heavenly Father..."" I almost choked. This book is geared towards families with moms and dads that arranged to get a baby from the birthmother.Not only that, my 5 yo and 4 you thought it was boring. So did I.Thumbs Down!"
3,A is for Adopted,"The concept of this book is wonderful but I had no idea how many religious references there would be. We are not Christian and much of the text was not applicable to our religion. I was disappointed that this book which at the outset seemed so perfect for our family, was not due to the religious overtones. I returned the book."
2,does not tell the universal story of adoption,"This book goes through the alphabet, repeating in similar words on every page that the baby is special and loved. (A is for adopted, B is for beautiful, C is for cuddle....) It's thoughtful but not inclusive enough to educate siblings or family members about adoption. Other books accomplish this end better, like Marianne Richmond's ""I Wished for You"" (any age) or even Marc A. Nemiroff's ""All about Adoption"" (for children adopted at older age).As other reviewers note, it is suitable for young children adopted at birth only. And it does reference God often. I like the poem on the first page (even wrote it down), but the rest of the book as very repetitive and I stopped reading about half way through."
5,Finally a Christian Children's Book on Adoption,"It's hard to find a book that fits one's own adoption story. However, there are so many children adopted into Christian families whose parents want to acknowledge God's hand in their story. I have to hold back the tears every time I read this book to my two adopted children."
5,Our lips are sealed,This song is so good it gets stuck in my head for days! I can't get it out!! :) (:
1,seal the mouths of these singers,"I don't know where Hilary got the impression that she should start a music career to go along with her acting career, but it was a bad idea for sure. Any opportunity this song had to be good has from here on been eternally eliminated, because the two sisters freakin' kill it. Awful singing, an awful pop style, (and a terrible music video) all come together and make this single an absolute atrocity. Never buy this awful single! If I were permitted to hold this single in my hands it would be completely mutilated within seconds. Either that I would enjoy a nice game of Frisbee or use it to adorn my wastebasket. Gosh, this ""music"" is terrible. Thank goodness it doesn't get airplay. Keep it that way, people! DON'T BUY THIS"
1,why do these people even pretend like they can sing,"Hilary Duff isn't that great of a singer. Apparently she thought since everyone's world revolved around her acting that everyone's world would revolve around her singing too. Guess what! No! This song might have been decent but she and her sister killed it for all eternity. Speaking of sisters, mine won't stop playing this song over and over and i""m so sick of it! I never liked it and never will! Hilary is perhaps the worst musical artist around today, and that's saying something because there are loads of terrible artists today (for example: pretty much all rap). Never buy this single. Heck, don't even look at it. Don't be aware of its existence. Move out of the country and start a new life. This single is awful! So awful!"
2,Propane Cylinder,"Beware! These cylinders come with a notice on them stating that it MUST be ""purged"" before use. No one in my area would fill it until purged, which costs $20. That makes it a very poor buy and big hassle to deal with."
3,Dented,I should have listened to the other reviews. The tank was shipped in flimsy packaging and sure enough had a very large dent near the top. Our propane filler almost wouldn't fill it due to the risk of possible explosion. We are using it but are watching it carefully. Would not purchase again due to the damage.
2,Boring,"It was boring and nothing I could not have done on my own. The title is misleading. It should have read exercising in a chair, not chair dancing. Where did that come from? I could have done the exercises from a TV show. OK if you are older and need to be careful of certain exercises. Not recommended for the more fit active exerciser."
4,I bet you they WON'T play this song on the radio!,"Push record on your VCR while watching your favorite Monty Python (MP)skits and parts of MP movies and you'll have this CD's contents with video; but it won't be neatly packaged up and ready to sit on your shelf like the Instant CD collection. This is one of the BEST MP compilations out there and was of course released originally as the Instant Record collection way back. For those of you younger than 25, a record is a flat piece of vinyl with the sounds basically scratched into the surface. My instant record collection wore out from the thousands of times I listened and laughed to it. You won't have that problem if you purchase the CD, with proper care it should easily outlive your flimsy human carcass. Enjoy and G'day Bruce!"
3,Destructive Fire,This text is an excellent example of idolatrous love. Majnun idolizes Layla while they are separated by society. A Romeo and Juliet story.
2,Don't waste your money on this book,"This book is a collection of papers from the author plus some background information on CBIR, Wavelets, Clustering, etc. Don't waste your money on this pricey monograph, because all of the papers are available at the author's website. Here's the table of contents:1) Introduction2) Background3) Wavelets4) Statistical Clustering and Classification5) Wavelet-based Image Indexing and Searching6) Semantics-sensitive Integrated Matching7) Image Classification by Image Matching8) Evaluation9) Conclusions and Future WorkIf you're looking for a textbook on Content-Based Image Retrieval, unfortunately, you have to wait longer because there's no satisfactory textbook in this relatively immature area."
3,Chocolate Discovery: Mildly Satisfying,"The Discovery of Chocolate is a great Book Club selection: it's a fast-moving romantic adventure that prompts readers to consider the effects of following one's passion (in this case, the love of chocolate), making good on promises, and the idea that one can, perhaps, have too much of a good thing. The overall premise is enticing, and the lush descriptions of Diego & Ignacia's romance is satisfying; however, the story seemed to rush past opportunities to discuss the sometimes crucial effects that timing, coincidence, and personal choices make on our lives. The question of what any of us would do with if we could live practically forever, or, is there such a thing as ""one true love"" were disappointinly glossed over. On another note, I wondered if this book were written by a woman, would have been dismissed as a ""romance."""
4,Not Bad,"I picked this book up on a whim, and while I am a great lover of both historical fiction and chocolate, I still have to rate this book as three stars(not four, technical error). The best thing about it is the mouth-watering descriptions of the chocolate confections Diego and his friends whip up. The time is fleeting (never a good thing when immortality is involved in a plotline) and the characters are brief and flat. Though it was a fun romp of a book with a good storyline, I think it perhaps could have been more effective as a collection of short stories about chocolate through the ages. Still, it's a decent book, and worth picking up for a bit of a vacation from ""heavy literature."""
3,Enjoyable,"This book floats through time with the story of chocolate and love. I found little to dislike, but did not find much to love either. It is an enjoyable book for me, but not memorable."
2,"It works, but not everytime","Average instructions, easy to install, but it only works about 75% of the time. And this is with the transmitter and the receiver only about 12 feet apart, with no obstructions or walls separating them. And this is using the power from the original door bell, so the issue cannot be batteries.Not recommended."
4,Casca's Vietnam experience in the French Foreign Legion,"Having noticed previous unhelpful reviews, I decided to write a proper one about the book. Casca is recruited into the French Foreign Legion in the aftermath of the second worldwar - the first part of the story deals with Casca's escape from a shattered Berlin and is wonderfully written - and trains in Africa.He is then shipped to Vietnam and is involved in the bitter war against the Viets fighting for independance. Gus Beidemann joins Casca and the two enjoy a few hilarious adventures before they are dropped into Dien Bien Phu in 1954 which saw the eclipse of France's Indochinese empire. The battle is well written and gives you some idea as to what went on in that terrible siege.For the world of Casca visit www.casca.net"
5,Succeeds on many levels,"This collection of keyboard sonatas arranged for guitar duo succeeds on many levels.Inventiveness: Scarlatti left us with 555 sonatas and never repeated himself. The 14 selections here give a good sampling of his creativity.Musicianship: Gray and Pearl perform their own transcriptions of these works, and they are completely attuned to the material and each other. Listen to track 4, Adagio in A minor, for perfectly matched phrasing and balanced interplay.Sound: Producer/Engineer Paul Bensel has captured the duo well. Close listening with headphones gives a satisfying stereo experience. The rounded mellowness of the guitars works equally well for unobtrusive background music. The level dynamic range, not too loud, not too soft, makes this disc a welcome commuter's soundtrack.High praise for a job well done. If you like this recording I can equally recommend Stephen Marchionda'sScarlatti Sonatasfor solo guitar."
1,Taciturn study of an interesting subject,"Well researched but not engaging.The author never immersed my interest or compassion with the ""Jewish mestizos"" living in one of the most remote cities in South America. Ariel Segal made me feel detached and unemotional about a subject that one could feel compassion. That of Jewish men, woman and children living in isolation from their culture and history. Perhaps, this subject could be reworked as a novel. The story of a white family in the Belgian Congo was addressed rather grippingly in The Poisonwood Bible by Barbara Kingsolver."
2,Nice Coach!,The product was larger than expected but my dog seem to like all of the room. She weighs approximately 16 pounds and have lots of room to stretch out.I did not like the fur inside; it sheds a lot and all over my car. Although my dog loved the size of this item she didn't seem to like the temperature of the seat regardless of the temperature outside. Of course during the summer the fur would get even warmer as a result she would eventually climb out of the seat.After 2 weeks of having this product the strap broke from the back of the seat. I decided not to send it back due to the size of this thing. It's huge!
5,Love It,"I've had mine for 10 years now and it still looks and works great. It's kinda big but just keep it it the garage. I had considered the ones that go over the headrest and suspends the dog, but I didn't want to have to strap it in all the time (since my dog doesn't ride with me very often) or worry about the bottom sagging. This is easy & fast."
3,Car Seat,I have to say its good size however the cream inner lining is terrible. It gets dirty easily and dose not wash well. Why don't they make inside lining with a darker color then it would be the perfect product!
3,"Measure first, this thing is huge","I had heard from a coworker that their dashchund really liked this lookout seat, so I went ahead and ordered it. I am not sure if they actually sent me the medium since the product was called ""oversized Lookout seat"", but the dimensions were the same. This thing is HUGE. I ended up returning it because I can't have that much room taken up in my car for a 12 lbs dog.Make sure to measure first to understand how large the bed is. We ended up making our own bed by gluing two pieces of scrap foam together and putting a cover on it - a much cheaper (~$8) solution and something we can manage better."
4,Missing strap,"Love the seat I had already purchased one for my other dog, this one arrived without the strap necessary secure the seat to the safety belt. Very disappointed !"
1,Too Big and Unstable,This seat is far too large for my car or my wife's SUV. It also seems too high and unstable as it hangs over the front of the car seat. We are returning it as it seems unsafe and is too big. It has great ratings but it seems like a marginal product that will now be a hassle to ship back. I wish we had skipped it.
3,"Pet Car Seat- Lookout 1 Medium Black (22""W)","I thought it was a little too high. Usually my dog likes to sit in it so he's up pretty high, which isn't safe."
2,Has some problems,"I bought two for my Chihuahuas. Basically this is a big block of foam the dog sits on top of. One dog kept jumping out and getting hung up on the seat belt. Never use this seat with a collar, only a harness. There is too muh leeway since the tether slides along the length of the seat belt. The only way to make them work right would be to cut a hole through the back and put the tether through that. The other dog did fine, but you never know when a dog will decided to jump out. Not safe to be driving on the freeway while worrying that your dog might be dangling from the seat belt."
1,Missing items from box and no easy way to get item replaced,"There is supposed to be a harness included in with this car seat- it even says so again with the instructions, however, there was no link for me to ask to have the harness sent- in fact amazons instructions were to contact Snoozer, which wasn't anywhere in the packaging or on amazons 3rd party sellers. Needless to say I'm going to either have to return the entire car seat just to take a chance that they don't forget to send a harness again or I have to go buy my own- NOT VERY HAPPY ABOUT THAT AT ALL."
4,"good product,but dog didn't like.","I thought it is a great car seat, very safe and well made. But my 10lb. chihuahua didn't feel the same? she is used to the car,loves her rides, not so much looking out ALL the time. I am going to save it in case we get another dog they may like it. she did like to use it as a bed indoors. I would recommend it, comes with a strong seat belt attachment for safety."
4,Nice and cozy,"The puppy was a little confused about being tied to the seat, but she's getting used to it. I love you cozy and warm it is for her, as we live in a cool, damp climate. Plus it sits very high, so now she can see out. I thought the price was a bit much for what it is, though."
5,Dog's Car Seat,My shih-tzu absolutely loves riding in this seat. She is finally able to look out the car windows. She leans her head on the front part and falls asleep. I am so happy with this purchase.
4,Great Product!!!,I got this carseat a few days ago and my puppy is loving it! It's roomy enough that my 7lb puppy can lay down if he's tired. Now I don't have to worry about him getting hurt or him falling off when I'm driving. The washable cover is an added bonus...
5,Very nice value,Perfect size for my dog and very comfortable. Would definitely recommend this to others who has a dog that loves to go in the car. This is one of my favorite things that my dogs loves to do and it allows him to look out the window which he loves too!
1,Why would you even call it a car seat?,Why would you even call it a car seat if it doesn't have the ablility to keep the dog in it? Really? All it is is a dog bed with stirofoam underneath to make it sit up higher - THAT'S IT. You can run a seat belt to keep the BED from going anywhere; but really what good does that do if you can't keep the dog in it? Returned it.
5,My dog loves it,"As soon as the item arrived, my rat terrier mix immediately went to sit in it - he is in love with the new car seat - he is very happy to sit in it in the car as well. He even loves to sleep in it in the house. Great item! Thank you."
5,Great seat for your Furry Friend!,"I have a Pomeranian and he loves to watch out the window when we go riding. This product is perfect! It gets him up high enough to see, and it is big enough that he can lay down when he wants. It attaches securely with the seat belt. I would recommend this to any pet owner who travels with thier furry friend."
5,It s just a wonderful car seat for our little doggie,"This is our second Snoozer lookout set since we purchased our first in 2005 since our dog at the time did not travel well and would get car sick and shake as soon as he knew that he would be in for a car ride. When we got the Snoozer installed as a last resource we were a little skeptical about if it would work, but there was no reasons for our concerns. The dog enjoyed his new car environment almost immediately and seemed to enjoy it ever since and was never car sick again. When he passed away we got a new and wonderful puppy of the same breed and and she also enjoy at time lengthy car rides. She likes to sit up and enjoy the views from time to time. We have never has any issues with the bed harness and she is aways wearing a body harness that is secured to the headrest pillars. We are absolutely thrilled with the product.BK"
4,A Great Seat,This seat is comfortable and sturdy. My dog likes to sit in it even when it's not in the car!It is a little small for my 16 lb. dog.
1,Not all that!,"I didn't like it for few reasons: 1) the material is like ship skin, extremely hot for warmer months or warm climates. 2) there is a gap were you attach the car seat and my small dog's legs fall there. 3) it is not that safe as it claims. 4) if you have a small dog that wants to lay down, s/he won't see anything. The height is the only positive point.I won't recommend it."
5,"comfy, cozy and very practical","These car seats are the best! This is my second ""Lookout seat"" (I have two dogs). I strap them in my backseat and actually leave the seats in there because my dogs are my kids. They go with me everywhere. Lots of room, they can see out the window and they are strapped in safely. Would definitely buy another for dog #3 (should that happen). Please note that if you have a small dog (I have Shih Tzu's - 18 pounds - the medium is extremely roomy. I could have opted for the small."
3,It's alright,"I wanted something for my dog and didn't want to spend a lot of money on it. This is kind of expensive for the material. The fabric is just cheap, I'm planning on making something waterproof one day. The sponge seat is just a big sponge and I'm sure that doesn't cost that much. But I guess I have no other choice since there aren't many pet car seat to choose from.I got small since it's good for dogs up to 18 lbs. I have a mini schnauzer and he's 14 lbs now, but I don't think he will grow much anymore since both of his parents are only 10 lbs. But this car seat is kind of small for my dog. I don't know how any 18lb dog can fit in it. He can sort of lay down but not like the picture. There's no way he can be in this seat like the picture. Either he has to sit, or he has to stand diagonally, or he has to curl up in it. I'm still going to use this though.Now I think about it, I think it would be better if they also had the dimensions of inside of the seat."
5,My 8lb Chihuahua LOVES this seat!,"Before I bought this car seat for my chihuahua, it was difficult taking her in the car with me, unless I had someone in the passenger seat willing to hold on to her. Even then - she was constantly wanting to move from the passenger side to my lap. She couldn't see out the windows & wasn't stable as I braked or turned. But now, I slip her harness on her & attach it to the strap that comes with this seat & she's in doggy heaven. Quiet as she can be. Just stares out the window & watches the world go by. I feel so much more comfortable knowing she's safely secured to the seat belt in the event I need to stop quickly or turn. Also, the liner comes out & is machine washable, haven't had to do that yet, but s nice feature nonetheless. Well worth the money. Works just as we'll in the backseat as the front. A harness is a must with this seat, but that's true with any dog car seat."
5,Perfect,This pup seat is just what I wanted and it came just in time for the weekend in perfect condition and at a great price.Thank you!
5,Great Dog Seat,"I have a Male Corgie Jack Russel cross that weighs about 26 Pounds. The Medium Lookout is the perfect size for him. He was a little aprehensive the first time I put him in his Lookout. But sence then when he sees me put it in the car, he's in the car and ready to go! He will even sit still for me to put on his safety harness. He loves it and I feel better knowing that he's safer, happy, and can see out."
3,lets go for a ride,"Very well made, small fits my 17 pound JRT quite well. We do use a harness that we purchased separately but i wonder how stable the seat will be if and when i have to stop suddenly. My Chip loves is as he can see out the window now. Also the seat is nice enough I don't mind putting it in the new bimmer:-)"
3,lil bulky,I recieved this product in a timely matter. It is a great product but very bulky and takes up half of my back seat. My dog loves it though because now she can see out the back window and i don't have to worry about muddy paws all over my car.
1,Recommends useless quack treatments,"This book does a great disservice to pet owners by its endorsement and recommendation of unproven alternative treatments.""Bach"" remedies contain alchohol and have never been tested or proven effective as treatment for any medical or behavioral problems by any recognized scientific study."
5,The Once Again Love at SWH,"Sweet Valley High was a fanstastic story . The setting of the book was in a high school in Sweet Valley in the present time .The main characters are Elizabeth and her, twin sister Jessica and Elizabeth's boyfriend Steve .My favorite character was Jessica because she had patience with everyone, She always had happy thoughts about everyting and she was the funniest one in the book. My favorite part of the book was when Jessica had an argument with Corteny the most popular girl in school . I would recommend this book to all girls and guys that are interested in romance and that like to have fun, because this is the type of book I like to read."
1,Zero Stars - One of the Worst Movies Ever Made,"Sting infiltrates a house and assualts a semi-comatose woman. Yuck! Misogynist, vile claptrap posing as an art film. Run away! Fast! If you want to see a similar story, watch the much better Theorem by Pasolini. Only surpassed in wretchedness by some Peter Greenaway movies."
3,daniel ross,Loved the movie especially since I'm a big Sting fan. The music was great the acting by Sting was right up his alley...the beguiling and coy personality was donr without a hitch. Would like to have seen more of the young girl talking because I feel she could've brought more of a lighter side to the movie but I had no problem with the flick.
5,Very dark,"Sting does a good job playing a sick [...] in this twisted psychodrama & it's not hard to see why this would get banned.This flick is disturbing & not easily forgotten since I first saw it back in the early 80's.The characters in this flick are just plain wrong,wrong,wrong...."
4,A parable that shows it's not all black and white,One of the most interesting things about the movie is the title -- Martin (Sting) is Brimstone (punishment) for some characters and Treacle (reward) for others.
1,great review for sam and oneils,We had ordered a used overhead projector with Oneil Imports - received it earlier than expected. But were so disappointed that it didn't work. Sam offered us a different one or complete refund. He apologized and was very cooperative in making this right with us. Thank you Sam.
5,Very Substantive Prayer Resource,"Though I'm not currently Lutheran, I have over the last few months been rapidly moving toward Lutheran theology. I bought this book with the hope that it would give me a glimpse of what prayer looked like to Luther. In short, my prayer life has been positively transformed through the prayers of this little book. Each prayer begins with a reminder of our standing before God, and moves into recognition of the awesomeness of God. I have left each prayer session with a renewed sense of my weakness and God's greatness. For those who are concerned that scripted prayers seem too contrived, I would provide a bit of advice. Don't simply read the prayers, but think about what you're saying as you read. Our Heavenly Father places far more stock in a sincerely offered pre-written submission than an off-the-cuff prayer that is devoid of any substance or humility."
3,Okay.,"This prayer book is great if you are looking for prayers for specific people-- i.e. for lawmakers, for those who work in agriculture, for the mentally ill, etc. It also has two sets of weekday prayers. However, some of the prayers belie the 1970 publication date-- for example, there is a lot more about nuclear war than most of us probably feel pressing on our hearts at this time. This book does not represent Lutheranism's beautiful liturgical tradition, nor is it all that widely used by Lutherans (although it is frequently given as a confirmation gift!). So if you are looking for a guide to the liturgical life of prayer, buy a hymnal/service book or other resource instead."
3,Basic Lutheran Prayer Book,This is a nice volume to have simply because it has prayers used in various Lutheran denominations. It is also of good quality for price paid.
2,Quite a disappointment,"If you are looking for a prayer book to engage in a daily prayer routine, I would suggest you look elsewhere. Basically this book contains brief, rather mechanical prayers and has selections from the Psalms and occasional prayers. A few other selected snippets of things found elsewhere and that's about it. It might be ok for busy people or for people who are nominal Christians, but there's just not much to it as a devotional tool or for a daily office."
5,Use It Daily,Challenges me to pray about life from a different view. Helps me shut out the world around me regardless of what is going on in my life.
2,Way over priced,The text contained some check lists that are useful but for the most part the book was a real ripe off!
1,"Poor design,Poor reception. Don't bother.","Working in a big blocked building it's hard to get reception on a radio here,but I had hoped this radio headphone set would be different,It wasn't. I can't tune one station in on this,and at my apartment,it's not that much better. I was only able to tune one of my favorite stations in,and that had static also. I live and work near a big city,so getting a strong signal was not the problem. Maybe it works best outside when your working out? But then again the design of this wasn't very well thought out. It has around the ear design,but it doesn't feel secure,and I would think it would easily fall off if your jogging with them on. I'll go back to using the,around the ear MP3 player that I have,until a better product comes along. The seller of this product shipped the item fast,and I would buy from him again. So there was no fault on their part,as to the quality of this product."
4,Second funniest book I've read in 10 years!,"Second installment of on-target witticism by the author of Falling Up The Stairs. Picks up with our unwilling hero, again caught in a web of unlikely (but plausible) circumstance. This time, ingredients include a beautiful bald woman, one irate failing radio persona, and a loaded pistol caught in the elastic cuff of hospital pants (how DO you aim your leg away from yourself..?) Both books are highly prizes personal posessions. Mail me if you like them!"
5,excellent,"The second volume of a trilogy about the liberation of Egypt from the Hyksos, this book tells the story of Seqenenra Tao's sons Kamose and Ahmose, who continue their father's revolt against the King Apepa. Among many of his doings, Kamose expands the army with a navy and rallies with a number of influential princes. If Kamose dies in battle, will Ahmose succeed him ? Based on the little-known historical facts regarding the Seventeenth Dynasty, the author describes an Egypt filled with nasty politics, intrigue and conspiracy. This is a novel every booklover will appreciate."
2,Better thanthe first book,"A mundane trilogy. See my review for The Horus Road, which applies to the other books as well."
5,Finally! Rock a bye baby on dvd,"I been waiting sooo long for Rock a bye baby to go to dvd. I saw this movie many times as a child and always loved it.I had it on vhs but, now it's so old it won't play. This is my favorite Jerry Lewis movie. Rock a bye baby is Jerry Lewis at his best especially his singing and dancing on a tv show in the movie when he's trying to get money to take care of Carla, his child hood sweet heart's babies. He has a beautiful voice so when he does a song side by side with his real life son who's suppose to be him as a young boy,it makes the movie heart warming and sooo sweet. Now I'm able to share this with my kids. Another great Jerry Lewis movie I can't find is Three on a couch with Janet Leigh. How long for that one?"
5,Whoa Baby!,"This video is awesome. My kids love to watch it and laugh hilariously. It is great for all ages (even me). It is about a man (Jerry Lewis) who is stuck helping raise 3 babies and it is really funny. If you buy this video, you won't be sorry."
4,Jerry Rocks,Jerry Lewis hits the ground running with this movie as his first solo effort after the break up of the Martin and Lewis team. Jerry shines with hilarious sight gags and predicaments. He shows great sensitivity and heart when confronted with the enormous task of caring for triplets. The musical numbers are appropriate and add to the movie's storyline.The movie includes debuts by Connie Stevens and Gary Lewis.This movie was a long time in coming to the home market. The blu-ray reproduction was gorgeous. I recommend this movie for the entire family. I have shown Jerry's movies to children and I am happy to see a whole new generation enjoying these cinematic treasures. I love seeing little kids laugh and giggle on the floor as I did when I first saw Jerry's antics.
5,Too cute!,This is a very cute...and funny movie about a guy who doesn't have a clue about babies ...even looses them in clouds of baby powder...and is determined to try to raise them on his own. It is typical Jerry Lewis funny but adorable.
3,contains only 1st CD of a 2 CD set,"At musicspace.com you can see this is supposed to be a 2-CD set, this includes only CD1, admittedly for a fraction of the price as a used CD.Taking it as it is, it is a pretty good collection, I give it 3 stars because of its being carved off of a larger set of tracks."
3,Pretty good overall,"If you're into New Wave you're obviously going to love this. My favorite track is The Killing Moon by Echo & the Bunnymen. I'm glad I got the CD for free, I'd never pay for it, but it does have good tracks...just overpriced at $17."
1,poor sound,Very disappointing performance. Sound quality is poor and tinny. The radio reception is also suboptimal.
1,Wonderful product for a rip-off,"I can't even believe that Memorex decided to put this out for the Christmas market season. After mine died, I opened it up to test what had happened in my case, and found that my water-resistant speaker was shot. If Memorex is going to market a radio as a ""shower"" radio, it needs to be able to withstand at least the amount of steam that you find on a bathroom mirror after a shower. Agreeing with some of the other reviews, I would not recommend this product for anyone, and feel that Memorex has violated my trust with them."
1,Poor Quality,I bought this shower radio from Linens n Things. The CD player used the batteries up very quickly. The sound quality was not very good. After 7 months the radio would not work. The CD player also stopped working.
1,Mildew Works Harder,This product is an embarrassment to the electronics industry. Sucks up batteries; CD stopped working after a dozen plays. Who tested this thing ... Al Queda? Because it certainly is trying to undermine any shred of decency that a store can have selling this junk!
1,This product is the worst!!,"Besides eating batteries, this CD player was a loser on many counts. After ten uses, one of the speakers died out. They were tinny sounding to begin with, anyway. Also, the radio couldn't get one lousy station in. Thanks for taking the product back, Amazon!"
1,Awful terrible product,"It uses a ton of batteries (6 C), which drain faster than you can put them in, and the company doesn't even have the decency to include the power adapter. That would be one thing -- if the product worked. But it doesn't. It broke after about two weeks, refusing to play CDs at all. Plus, the radio volume reset to zero every time it was turned off. The device was poorly designed, with controls that were very unintuitive. Having read the other reviews of this product, it's clear that this was more than just bad luck on our part. Do Not Buy This."
2,Dakmart ripped me off!,"I have attempted to contact this vendor and have left numerous messages for a refund. I've blown through as many batteries as it cost me to purchase the radio. There is obviously something wrong with this product. I have not had a return phone call or an email concerning my return. I am NOT pleased with this purchase and will never go order anything from them again! The product sucks, by the way. It holds a battery charge for about a day!"
1,Product is not a good one,"This was a pricey item I bought for my son for X-mas.The design is VERY poor -- hard to open the CD compartment.Very flimsy hooks to hang it to a shower rod....really, reallynervy of them to provide what seem essentially like twistedpaperclips, at best. One little adjustment and it falls down!The rubber cover over the headphone jack and such does notstay down -- not a good feature for what is supposed to bea water-resistant product. Also, they did not includean AC adapter, which is incredible, given the price. Also,after day 2 it played CD's poorly -- too slow and skipped around.I went back for a refund on day 3."
1,Set Fire To 4 Twenty Dollar Bills - It Is Easier!,"Uses and drains 6 size ""C"" Batteries in 38 minutes. I bought the rechargeables, drains those quicker. I bought an adapter. It plays for 20 seconds, stops and says ERROR. If I saved the box and sales slip, I would return it. JUNK - JUNK - JUNK. Sounds like speakers in soup cans.UPDATE: September 2009I have not bought a Memorex product since!!!!"
1,Wish I read these first. Don't make the same mistake.,"If all you want is a digital tuner in the shower, and you want to buy 6 new dry cells every 2 weeks, this is the product for you! I can't imagine how [angry] I'd be if had bought this for the CD player."
1,Absolutely Thought about throwing it away,"This product was given to me as a gift. It looked nice, smelled like a new piece of electronics, however, I think I've spent more on batteries than was paid for the device. I would highly recommend looking at other brands."
1,wouldn't want it for free,"Very disappointing. The construction (rubber gaskets cheap) and the plastic chasis were of low quality. The unit is not very practical, requiring 6 ""C"" batteries that drain quickly. The A/C power cord (not included) can't really be used in the shower.Although the buttons function well, ultimately the poor audio quality couldn't justify the cost."
1,"Drains batteries, broke down after a couple of month","My radio just could't get enough power. It swollowed batteries without first chewing them. Finally, it broke down two month later - the sound disappeared. No sound from radio and from CD. I decided not to repair, but to throw it away. Don't even want to waste shipping fees on fixing it."
1,JUNK,"This riadio did't meet any of my expectations. It is big, fragile, and stoped workin the first time I used it with a CD, and never worked again... Not even the radio. It lasted for about 2 days... Don't waste your $$."
1,Do NOT waste your money,"I bought this product for my nephew for Christmas and also decided to buy one for myself. I thought something was wrong with the unit because I could only play one cd before it showed an error message and not function. I sent it back to the manufacturer and they replaced it. The same thing happened with the new cd player. I then realized that the first player was not a fluke, the product is manufactured so poorly, it drains batteries so quickly, as to render it useless. By the way, my nephew had the same experience. Three for three. Memorex should be ashamed."
1,Sticking With Soap,"Are you kidding me? I dont think you can call it a cd player when it doesnt know how to play cd's. Maybe it's a ""player"" but not anything musical."
1,opinion,does any one have an opinion of the sharper image shower radio cd player. have u tried it. we want to buy it for a birthday present and it is 200 dollars. is it worth .do u need the optional adapter? will the batteries last.? debbie
5,A must have.,"I have picked up this magazine a couple of times before where ever I might find them. So I am sitting in my doctor's office and there I am reading the magazine. All of sudden it hits me, ""why don't I have a subscription to this magazine""?Cleveland Magazine is a must have for people in Northeast Ohio if you want to know what is going on. I love it because of how it breaks down the restaurants by type of food, price, location, and even what type of credit cards they accept. This is great for anyone who loves to dine out and is looking for something new to try. It is always a great source for business that you never heard of but are right down the street. It lets you know what festivals are coming up, what out of the way events are going on, and where to party is going to be this month! If you live in Northeast Ohio and you want to get out on the town and try new things or just find out where the hot spots are you need to pick up this magazine, you wont be disappointed!"
5,"If you're moving to (or living in) Cleveland, Ohio....","Solid guide to what's going on in Cleveland as well as well-written articles about the region. If you're moving to Cleveland, pick up a copy so that you begin to understand the wonderful opportunities this region offers."
1,Never delivered,"I ordered Cleveland Magazine months ago and never received any copies. When I inquired about the missing magazine, customer service repeatedly told me that it would be ""five business days"" to investigate my request. As you can guess, I'm still waiting."
2,not impressed,"Not impressed with this product. Hard to determine the required size, and when it arrived it was way off the mark. I ended up just changing the settings on my display to reduce eye strain, and making sure to take breaks from long stretches of computer work, and that is more cost-effective."
2,Too small,"The description says this item fits a 16-19 inch monitor, but it actually cuts off about half an inch of screen on every side. I would recommend getting a size larger -- a screen for a 21-inch monitor for your 19-inch.It does cut down on eye strain very well, but the glare is actually worse if you're sitting with your back to a light source."
4,anti-glare filter,"The filter does eliminate most of the glare, so I'm satisfied with the product. It was slightly tricky to attach it to the LCD monitor."
1,Terrible,"Having moved from Southern California to Northern Idaho, I was looking for map information of off road trails and roads in my area. During my investigation, I ran across this Maptech software and it sounded pretty good so I bought it. It is worthless, it didn't even show major trails and roads that I have been on many times. It didn't show much of anything, and when I looked at streets in the town I live in, it showed things that haven't been around in years. The information must be 20 years old. Even my Microsoft ""Streets and Trips 2006"" software was more informative and it isn't meant to be used for off road. I called the company and they basically said, too bad. I see now that it isn't even available through Amazon.com anymore. Good thing, but I would advise against any Maptech products."
2,Beaver Brand Deli Mustard,"I love this stuff - didn't know it had High Fructose Corn Syrup in it! GrrrrThis is not product specific, but I have noticed that when I buy bulk on Amazon some of the companies ship out their close-dated items. We purchase for our large family to save money, but it does not save anything to have to throw out what is out-dated after a short time. I wish there was some way to communicate and find out what the products are dated are when I purchase here."
4,What it says it is.,"This arrived in perfect condition. It's a little expensive being I can buy a used 20Lb tank full of propane locally, but I wanted a larger tank so I ate the upfront price."
4,Propane Cylinder,"This was a gift item and he was very happy with the item, so I cannot add anything more than that other than the Seller was good to work with."
3,3 Select a review type video camera Video review Written review Reviews must contain at least 20 words about the pr,propane cylinder was ok but very light weight I am sure it is heavy enough to pass dot spec but the shroud around the valve was allot thinner material than my other cylinders and was bent when I received it.
5,The only way to buy a propane Cylinder,"I BBQ alot, so therefore I find it only good practise to buy something larger than the tipical size most people normally buy, which is the 20lb. The product came to me in good shape...no complaints!"
3,steel tanks could not take the shipping,"I ordered two tanks.1st one arrived in way over sized box with a bent handle.fed-ex said I could not refuse because I'd opened the box.second one never showed.I got email saying it was shipped ,with tracking number .logged into fed-ex,which said they could not send info label as they have not gotten the product yet.now two weeks latter,I called Amazon,they got my second tank to me in about 4 days.this time undented in proper sized box."
1,"Poor packaging, damaged tank","The one star is for the packaging, not the tank. The tank is a good value, but just like the other reviews, one of the two tanks came in too big a box with just some paper for padding. So of the two tanks I bought, the bottom was bent on one, but after contacting Amazon, they replaced it promptly and let me keep the one with the damaged base. So I have three tanks, two excellent shape and one with a bent base, but still usable. But I checked with the propane dealer to confirm it usability. So now I have a spare. Kudos to Amazon for prompt replacement. Boos and hisses for poor packing to ship"
4,What about Spanish audio!,"Its great that Dragonball Z is being released with special features, however, they are forgeting to add the Spanish audio. I grew up watching Dragonball Z in Spanish. The episodes transmitted on the Mexican station Televisa did not cut scenes from the show. The audio translation was dramatic and hilarious. The season sets are region 1,2 and 4 compatible, which means they are playable in any Latin America dvd player. Spanish audio surpasses the English audio simply because they keep it as authentic as the Japanese version. The English audio improved in the season sets. Spanish audion should be place in the new Dragon Box Set and in the future blu-ray sets. Can't wait for Spanish audio and actual special features."
3,Should be released on Blu Ray!,"I think that it is great that Funimation is releasing this high quality DBZ box set, but it would be perfect if it was released in Blu Ray format. I agree with the many DBZ fans that are tired of double dipping on DBZ DVD's (some of us who have bought the VHS tapes, the first DVD releases, and the season sets, will now be quadruple dipping!) and this next DBZ set would be more justified if it were in HD format. Seeing these newer box sets come out on Blu Ray would make quadruple dipping worth while. In fact, it would be even more upsetting to buy these new box sets and then they are re-released again later on on Blu Ray. Not to mention DBK coming soon as well. The Dragonball shows are some of my favorite programs of all time and I am a die hard fan, but this constant re-releasing is getting ridiculous however, re-releasing in new formats like Blu Ray is understandable and welcomed."
2,Why does Funimation keep doing this?,"I have personally bought all nine season box sets of Dragon Ball Z. I'm just as a big fan as the next guy. But is this box set really necessary? It just seems like another scheme to get more money. It's bad enough that they're releasing the DBZ movies again but now this? They need to end with the Dragon Ball box sets. I personally wish they would have started with Dragon Ball and maybe combined the DBZ a little better, but this is ridiculous. Funimation thanks us for buying their box sets by releasing something like this, saying we should have bought this instead? It's just disappointing. I hope I'm not the only one that feels like this."
5,Great DBZ and getting more!,"The DBZ box sets are exactly what I was looking for. My only disappointment is that you have to change the original Japanese Dialogue to english every time and that the opening credits are not the opening credits that I grew up watching on DBZ on T.V., but still exactly what I want from DBZ. Picture and graphics are exactly what I expected. I can't wait to get the DBZ set's in box set and will order then ASAP. No Blue Ray available though. Not sure if I will re-invest into Blue Ray considering how much I will invest in the DVD's themselves. Great sets! Get the Box sets not the individual seasons!"
1,Sad,"This is a terrible thing to do to one of the most beloved anime franchises of all time: Funi is just milking this for all it's worth now. If they cared at all about the fans then they would have released this as it was in Japan... a full Dragon Box, for those that do not understand, merely look at the images linked for this product. American audiences are shafted and regardless of what anyone says: the quality of the orange boxes far surpasses the quantity that is shown in this sets picture. Would a fan not rather have a remastered version of something than a grainy full image?The only people buying this are the sheep of Funimation who will only be disappointed once this series is released as a complete box set or better yet as a complete Blu-ray box set... only time will tell, but to anyone who purchases this product: you are only lining the pockets of people who do not care about this series at all."
1,This is unfair to all the people who have bought the orange boxsets...,"Hence how many times they mention Dragon Box. They're taking the mic. If you have already bought the orange boxsets which were only released a year ago, then don't buy the dragon box until it comes down in price. All your really paying for is the new artwork. I think Funimation have made a crude decision and they know it. They should be thinking about making brand new episodes of Dragon Ball not reselling the same thing over and over again. Shame on Akira Toriyama for for giving permission in such a short amount of time since the orange boxsets were released."
5,cam,"This is beter than the others and looks beter. I love the way they look,Dragon Ball Z: Dragon Box One"
4,Birnbaum's the best!,"My fiance and I went to Walt Disney World last year for the first time together (it was also the first time for him). We found the Birnbaum book to be the best, we also bought The Unofficial Guide but the Birnbaum book was the book we brought with us to Florida. The phone numbers, rates and the ""Great meals and good times"" sections are invaluable! We are going to Walt Disney World for our honeymoon next year and I can't wait to buy the 2001 edition!"
3,It's VERY Happy,"While this book isn't exactly bad, it is the OFFICIAL guide and you can tell why. It is very positive and uncritical. If you want the facts and only the facts it's great, but if you want to know a little more of the details of what to truly expect on your trip, you're better off with The Unofficial Guide."
4,"Unofficial, Schmunofficial!","Well, I am so dissapointed in all the reviews I read bashing this official guide, while praising the unofficial! I used this guide in 1994, my first visit there, and it saved me. My husband and I are going in December( the off season, and least crowded by the way!) and it is his first time there. Again, I feel this guide gave us the most comprehensive, and complete overview of the whole place. We have planned where we will eat, what attractions we want to see most to make the most of our six day trip, and have a very good idea of what everything will cost. My view of the book has never been that it is so biased. I thought it was pretty honest as far as my last trip there as what to definately see, and what to skip. I fully agreed. This is one of the largest, most dizzying places to visit on earth, but if you go with a good of what you're getting into, the trip can feel well worth while, and worth all that hard earned cash you'll spend on it! Get this book!"
2,The Official Line Doesn't Stack Up,"If you want a non-bias opinion, buy the UnOfficial Guide. This is a ridiculous guide slated to the side of Disney. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone except for the pictures which are fair at best."
2,Assembly errors in the publishing industry,"Unfortunately this book proved very unusual in that it was assembled incorrectly. At page 64 it started again with another page 64 upside down and went on for about a third of the book before flipping back to right side up. The book is very informative, even if your disorientated."
3,"Well, it is colorfull......","My family and I recently had a 10 day visit to Orlando and I ran out and bought ""Walt Disney World with Kids 2000"", ""The Unofficial Guide to Walt Disney World 2000"", and Birnbaum's. I read them all from cover to cover, made lots of calls and now consider myself to be an expert on the subject of how to cram the best stuff into the best days for your florida trip. After reading ""The Unnoficial Guide"", Birnbaum's book was a big dissapointment. His book did not give half of the information that ""The Unofficial Guide"" gave. About the only good thing I can say is it does make a nice souvineer book, but If you are like me and want as much info on every subject you can think of smashed into your brain, get ""The Unofficial Guide"". We are going back again next February and I won't waste my time or money on anything but."
4,Birnbaum's Walt Disney World 2000,"This book gets you very excited about your trip to Walt Disney World. It has many ""hot tips"" on when the less crowded times are, also you find out things the ""uninformed"" person would not know about WDW, like the ""e-ticket"" and the best times to visit your favorite rides. It can truly make your vacation the most magical experience of your life! On the down side, Birnbaum's books are the ""official guide books"" of WDW and they tend to have a positive outlook on everything, like the hotels and food. Our family found the food overpriced and tasted the same at practically every restaurant we ate at! It over glamourized the hotels also. But I would recommend this book for first time Disney visitors, It is very helpful."
1,Very disappointing - an amorphous ball of fur,"This looks nothing like the picture. It is completely overwhelmed by unmanageable fur. It took me several minutes to unearth the beady little eyes (which were then instantly lost in fur once again). You seriously can't even tell where the legs are for all the fur. Oh, and did I mention the FUR!!! Anyway, I tried to groom it before giving it to my four-year-old and she didn't say she hated it, but expressed concern at her dog's lack of eyes and she hasn't really played with it since. I would only buy this if your child is really into combing/grooming things and not really playing with them (because the fur gets all messed up again the minute you start to play with it) - although I don't think all of the grooming in the world could make it look like the picture."
5,"Anita Ward, Much More Than Just ""Ring My Bell""!","Anita Ward has a unique and beautiful voice, delicate, yet soaring and soulful. This CD contains all sixteen songs from her two 1979 albums, ""Songs Of Love"", and ""Sweet Surrender"". The material is well written and arranged, and there is a consistency of production and performance that make this an enjoyable listen from start to finish.If you are only familiar with ""Ring My Bell"" you may be surprised at the quality and variety of this collection. ""Don't Drop My Love"", ""Cover Me"" and ""Can't Nobody Love Me Like You Do"" are great dance songs that equal or surpass ""Ring My Bell"" without copying it. Anita Ward also shines on the bittersweet ballads ""You Lied"", ""I Won't Stop Loving You"" and ""If I Could Feel That Old Feeling Again"".The sound quality of the CD is quite good, and the music still sounds fresh decades after it was recorded."
5,Really Nice,"I am crazy about my 3M 1700 overhead projector. Don't know how it compares to others, but it works, is lightweight, and great quality craftsmanship.I do have one problem...I just checked the online manual and can't figure out how many amps the cord is. I feel so dumb, but just don't know electrical things. I wanted to get a short extension cord (from Amazon) so I can use the projector in my classroom. The classroom is in an old part of a church that lets us use it for teaching ESL. There is only one outlet in the whole room. Anyway, can someone tell me the amps on the unit? I noticed the manual said to be sure and get the right amps for an extension cord or else the unit could overheat. Great! So now what, since they don't say what that is (how many amps). Guess we are all supposed to know that stuff."
4,very well received,This was purchased as a gift. The recipient has since remarked on how much he has enjoyed reading and learning and enjoying the scope of its information.
2,A waste of time and money,"I was disappointed with this book. It's a small book in terms of number of pages and physical length and width. The typeface is so small that you have to read it 6 inches from your face. Also, the author merely copied material out of almanacs, encyclopedias, and other sources. There are some interesting tidbits of information, but overall it's just a hodgepodge of facts that the author cobbled together with no rhyme or reason. Some of them were obviously added for no reason other than to fill the remaining blank space at the bottom of a page. This book was apparently modeled after the series of Uncle John's Bathroom Reader books which are far better in scope and content. I'm sorry I wasted my money on this book."
2,not recommended,"I love miscellany and trivia. The original Book of Lists ranks among my favorite possessions. I received Schott's book with high hopes. Unfortunately, I have to add my name to the critics.The book does not make good reading material because most of it is World Almanac-type facts, not interesting curiousities. But it cannot qualify as a reference, since it is neither ordered nor complete."
5,Feel Smart with Schott's Original Miscellany,"Ok, this book for some reason has become a bathroom book, don't ask why, I just keep finding it there, that being said I don't think that it should hinder anyone from buying it, ever since I've owned my copy I buy copies for gifts, everyone who I've giving it to has loved it and read the entire book. And yes I have to say its a very cheap way to feel smart."
2,Cheap bits for a cheap price.,"There cheap, don't expect much. The case isn't worth it either. Some of the bits were to dull to use out of the box. But a little filing fixed that. Once again the saying is true, you get what you pay for. I didn't pay much and I didn't get much. Not recommended."
1,bits are not precise,Not good quality. I returned them and bought a rockler HSS set for only about twice the price. They are precision.
2,Not so good,"Several bits are not perfectly straight. They wobble in my drill press. For the price, it's tolerable."
5,Absolutely Beautiful,"Accompanied by Dino Saluzzi on bandoneon, Chris Carrington on classical guitar, and Gumbi Ortiz with percussion, Al DiMeola delivers some of the most brilliant acoustic work ever. Here you will not find flashy compositions like those from 5DEC80 in San Francisco, instead you will get beautiful works of art which speak to your soul. World Sinfonia is definitely a 'BUY' and you won't realize it until after hearing it for the first time you see that you haven't moved since the moment you pressed play on your stereo."
5,One of the best guitar albums ever,"Absolutely an excellent album through and through. Very meditative and intense yet moving. A casual listen and the music might seem demanding at times..there are some tense moments. Still, he can sweep away the crashing phrasiology and leave listeners gasping at the beautiful guitar work. There's even a little bit of classical blended into the flamenco-esque piece ""La cathedral"" (#10) Can't say enough good things about this album. A must have for serious music lovers or guitar enthusiasts...a VERY IMPRESSIVE album indeed, and at the risk of sounding blasphemous, more listenable than some of his electric jazz fusion recordings."
5,Classic,"A PC classic. Love it.70s funk, car, guns. Great game, try it!I did have some compatibility issues on Windows 7 but eventually it worked."
5,Very detailed and realistic adventure! A must-read.,"This book has it all! Lots of military action, but of the sophisticated kind. Romance, too. Exciting, very deep and moving at times. We get to see the mercenaries not just as shallow cutouts of soldiers, but as people, getting a glimpse into their inner selves. Very detailed and factual, almost as if Carney is writing from personal experience. Has a great closing paragraph! I could go on and on, but you'll have to read it yourself."
3,Beware the Ballads!,"I was really excited to find out the Counts had two more albums after ""What's Up Front"" but this cd is a real mixed bag. There are definitely moments though. Funk Pump turns it out, the opening medley is hot and flies on a watermelon is really good. On the other hand, what ever possessed these guys to cover Jazz Man?!? Definitely worth a bit of programming to pick over the clunkers."
1,Product Misrepresentation,"The image of the item shows a hose with one male connector and one female connector. The item shipped has two female connectors and an adaptor. The description of the item states ""withstands pressure up to 4750 PSI."" The item shipped is stamped with a pressure limit of 2400 PSI."
2,Karcher 25 ft. pressure hose extension,"The threads did not match up on my original hose and just would not tighten by hand only, but tightening it with a pair of pliers did work. Without using the pliers for tightening the hose kept blowing off. The threads in the hose that came with my Karcher pressure washer are plastic where as the threads inside this extension hose are metal. I went and purchased a quick connect so I would not wear down the plastic threads on my washer by hooking and unhooking this extension hose. Other than that it is a good extension hose."
2,Karcher 2.640-850.0 Pres Washer Ext Hose,This is the wrong hose for the pressure washer I bought from Amazon at the same time. There is nothing on Amazon's website which would lead one to understand these two things are not compatible.
1,Do not buy this fro K 3.690 washer,DO NOT BUY THIS PART if you own a K 3.690. IT DOES NOT FIT. I looked up the part number on the Karcher web site which same as what is listed here and drove to local Walmart and bought the hose only to find the connectors are totally wrong! I have the newer model K 3.690 with the built in reel.
1,pic wrong,"Ordered this item waited 1 week for shipping. Got it in and went to use it and it was not the right item. The pic shows two female connections, with a double male adapter, but it is not that way. I called the shipper and he read in their web site is not a replacement hose. He could not understand the item shipped was not the same item in the picture. Might work great for an extention but it is not the right item as the pic, it has a male and a female. Amazon was wrong and put me back at least 2 weeks and i got to wait for my money to be returned. But this is the first time they lead me wrong."
5,Superb,I have now read all of Susanna Gregory's medieval whodunnits (A masterly murder being the latest). They are excellent. I am sure there are many Ellis Peter's fans who will decry them as a poor imitation but they are simply the best out on the market. Admittedly it has taken Ms Gregory 4 novels to really get going and you can almost see the development in the writing skills as you read each one. What makes them good is that the whodunnit is secondary to the character development and microcosm of 14th century Cambridge. By the sixth novel in the series each character is well rounded (certainly in Michael's case!) and consistent with a huge variance of supporting actors. Whilst each murder is a separate mystery in itself the ramifications of each one reaches into the later books and indeed provides clues and reasoning behind the later actions of the Cambridge scholars and townspeople.Read them...
3,Wish it was better.,"The product certainly reduces glare, but not as much as I had hoped. I have had great success with 3M products, so I suspect it was a matter of balancing how dark the screen can be with how much glare to remove.I also have a problem with the width. I am using it on a Toshiba laptop that is about 15.3"" diagonally and 13.1"" horizontally. The EX10L measures 16"" diagonally, but only 12.75"" horizontally. Not having the full width is frustrating. It is about 2"" higher than necessary. I could have lived with it being a little short much easier than a little narrow.The support brackets didn't work well for my situation. I found using a large, 1"" metal binder spring clip on either side works great. They are available at office supply stores."
1,caused more glare,"My screen actually had more glare with the filter than without. Awful quality, and on top of that, I had to pay a 15% restocking fee for under par merchandise."
1,Save your money,"I purchased this book as a gift for my mother-in-law, a retired judge. It is fortunate I previewed the book before I sent it on, or she would have sentenced me to the workhouse. This book is an absolute waste of time and money.The author apparently collected statutes from a variety of sources, and spends 90 pages usually listing one sentence summaries with no reference and little organization. Examples from this book include:""In Marblehead, Mass., it is illegal to cross the street on Sunday, unless it is absolutely necessary.""""In Atlanta, it is against the law to secure a giraffe to a telephone pole or a street lamp.""And it goes on and on. Forget about this book, and save your money."
5,Perfect for any child who has been told not to wake the baby,I purchased this book for my soon to be 4 year old who is constantly reminded not to wake his baby brother. It immediately became his favorite book and has been read multiple times since Christmas. The situations are funny and the sounds are great. He likes to pull the tabs to make the different noises and he especially likes the ending.
5,Dysphagia Cup,"This is a good example of considered industrial design. Its shape makes the use by patients easy. Careful design allows draining of the cup contents without the need to tilt the head back excessively. This feature helps to reduce the possibility of the contents ""going down the wrong way"".The base is thicker than the rest of the cup.This puts mass where it is needed to stabilize the cup.The handle adds to the stability being part of the base; it is also wide enough to provide a firm grip.The cup is also dishwasher friendly although it requires careful placement to fit in our machine.We purchased almond and green cups.Both colours are satisfactory, however if we were going to buy again we would probably purchase almond.This is because we cannot see that the more expensive green cup offers anything for the extra money.Almed's delivery was prompt and the packaging was suitable for safe transit."
5,A Great Find,"I bought a couple of these cups for my father in law who has ALS and they have been a life saver. He's not able to pick a normal glass coffee cup because of the weight or the size so this has been a great alternative. The handle is nice and wide so he's not trying to squeeze his hand in there. It's lightweight, but weighted at the bottom enough that it doesn't tip easily. The design of the cup is also nice because there's a wide rim so that his nose fits right on in there and he doesn't have to lean his head back while trying to hold the cup of coffee. Truly a great product for anyone with disabilities."
5,Very satisfied.,"My dealing with this company was great. I got exactly what I was looking for with a fair price, and it was shipped quickly."
1,"Jesus taught to love, NOT to bash!","Mr. Dietmar Scherf,There are some uplifting ideas in your book, however, once I began to read on and on about how terrible the Mormons Religion is for the history of polygamy, I was turned off. I have been baptized into the (Mormon) Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints and I do not believe in polygamy. It is a puzzling part of HISTORY. But tell me, how does bashing a religion relate to your book, ""I Love Me: Avoiding and Overcoming Depression""? I had suffered depression for many years - and since I began learning about the Church of JESUS CHRIST of Latter Day Saints, (or Mormon Church), I have not been depressed and hope to ""Avoid"" depression in the future. It seems that the one ""depressed"" about the church is you. The next time, you are about to put down a religion, I challenge you to pray to God, in the name of Jesus Christ, asking if Jesus Christ, himself, would engage in such bashing. Sincerely,A Child of God"
1,"Deserves less than one star, actually.",This book is a waste of time and paper. The author does not have the expertise to deal with a medical and psychological subject such as depression. The book wanders and is full of hateful stereotypes. I don't even want to waste the time sending it back.
1,"Wandering far afield, needs editing, frustrating to read","(I'd leave no stars if possible)I was unable to gather any new information from my attempts at forcing myself to read this book. I was completely distracted by its dire need of an editor who understood sentence structure and grammar.The anecdotes the author related about people (celebrities) that I could not relate to, such as Princess Diana, to give but one example, and the wandering in circles around issues completed frustrated me.After reading the first two chapters, I returned this book. I've never returned a book before, but this one would never be read by me, and I knew I couldn't even borrow it to anyone and subject them to the same experience of bewilderment I had just gone through."
5,An important book for our time,"This book explains the root of depression and also offers a solution for healing of depressive cycles. The author has a kind of different approach from most other books that I've read on the subject, although in the beginning he goes right into psychological key issues that lead to depression, e.g. ""The Search"", ""Wanna be Loved?"", ""Trying to change the unchangeable"" and so forth. Dr. Scherf explains it in detail. And as the book progesses he teaches how to love yourself, discusses important issues that concern everybody's life, and then he systematically leads the reader to victory with chapters such as ""More than conquerors"", ""A perfect life/Abundant life"" with a chapter on ""Ultimate Prosperity"" concluding this most excellent book. Important questions of life are answered with substance and preciseness without sentimentality."
5,A good thing--a good book!,"While apparently some of the critics of this book are bothered by the religious undertones of this book, I really appreciated the Bible-based principles in this practical form. Rarely ever do you find excellent spiritual material with practical application. And the author gets the job done--so to speak, because he doesn't hover around some self-effort junk, but tackles the problem at the source. And I consider it one of the best depression books ever published, because it helps a lot."
1,Dreadful. Don't bother.,"This book, published by the author, has very little to do with depression and mostly to do with the author's opinions of himself and the world. I could carry on endlessly about all the faults of this book, but nothing speaks louder than the author's own words. Here are some direct quotes from the book: ""A white shirt or blouse under a black coat often enhances class."" ""A little makeup and lipstick to welcome your husband home after a day of hard work may do wonders - try it."" ""But, pardon me for asking, how can anybody portray themselves to have a family emphasis with the history and background of polygamy like the Mormons do?"" ""Stay simple, let the man be the head of the household."" ""Along the way we're also confronted with the perverted sex like homosexuality."" It's hard to believe this book could help anyone suffering from depression. More likely, the reader would end up even further depressed."
2,Don't have the patience to finish it,"It's not a bad read for the first few chapters. The later chapters are repetitive and obscure to me. It makes too many reference to the Bible, which I don't understand at all. I would not recommand this book to any one."
2,This book should be in the Religion section,"My title says it all...after reading the glowing reviews of this book, it sounded like the best book on depression ever.I was in for a shock when it arrived - I thought maybe I had gotten the wrong book.I personally believe in God, but I felt completely manipulated when I found the entire book to be a sermon. If you want to be saved, read this book (let me give you a better reference - the Bible), if you want a good, objective book on depression - look elsewhere."
1,Cynical Trash,"Depression, of course, is a serious and debilitating condition. Publishing and distributing this book under the guise of a depression self-help book is irresponsible and cynical."
2,A bit too much god in here,"I was disappointed in this book - other reviews highly recommended it, but I found it preachy and overly religious. Also, it's simplistic and seems written for a much younger than adult audience."
1,Simplistic and insulting,"I found this book had good intentions but was extremely simplistic in it's approach. The author assumes that all a depressed woman needs to do is get married and she will be happy. He tends to be very judgemental and preachy totally ignoring all the facets that make up the illness of depression.I am a Christian so I am not opposed to the book on those grounds. It just seemed that the approach was one of "" smile, believe and you will feel better.""I felt the book was talking down to me and I was so annyed I couldn't even finish it. Definitely NOT helpful to someone who has struggled to battle this illness, It reinforces all the stigma and stereotypes that those who have not experienced it tend to believe about depression.I am sorry I wasted my time trying to read it."
1,"Simplistic, close-minded, formulaic, vacuous","I'm quite surprised at the number of positive reviews this book received. Out of the many dozens of books I've bought over the years, this is one of maybe three that I've found so useless that I returned it. Mr. Scherf has no training as a psychologist; he bases his book on his religious faith. This would normally be just fine, but he boils it down to ""You're OK because God made you,"" and ""You'll be great if you just hold to the Truth"" (i.e., the Bible). I am an intelligent _and_ religious person, and I found this book to be the worst vacuous pop-fluff-psycho-religious opinion-spewing I've seen in a long, long, long time."
2,I got depressed after I read this book!,"I was appalled at the white male patriarchal tone of this book. I think it's wrong the way he puts down other people's religion and judges others by his standards. Basically, he gives only pat answers to depression. If you are protestant, heterosexual, white, superbiblical, you may like this book."
4,Worth a Look,"This is the third novel in Collins' 'Road' Trilogy, the first of which was the superb graphic novel, The Road to Perdition. The latter was also an excellent film, though some changes were made in the ending, the original ending being more consistent with the ending of Road to Paradise. Hint: it has to do with the importance of religion in each protagonist's life.Road to Paradise's characters are engaging and the plot is riveting. It is Collins' intention to catch the flavor of 70's Chicago and the 70's mob. The conclusion of the novel involves a mob hit which remains unsolved but is neatly 'solved' in Collins' fictional construct. This is a fine novel, well worth a look."
3,"OK for the sales price, but not for full price.","These shoes are merely OK - for the sales price. I'd have been very upset if I'd paid the MSRP! I had to stretch them as they were rather snug and hurt my toe areas. They are OK for errands and short walks, but I'd never wear them to work or for all day; I tried it and my feet were killing me."
2,amazon softwalks,"These were tight for my normal size 6. Otherwise, super soft &otherwise would have been good."
3,perfume sample,"this perfume smells incredible. i knew this was a sample and would be small, however, the price of s&h; is outrageous on these very small products. again, as in some of my other reviews, a rip-off. that being said, i wouldn't buy this again because of size and mostly price, but the perfume itself, in a bigger bottle, possibly from another source and a better price, definitley. very lovely scent.oh, also as a side- note, this sample did not come on a card as shown in the picture, it was a very small plastic spray vial with no cover."
2,Disappointed reader,"I didn't make it to page 100 before extreme boredom set in.This story is not well-focused -- the point of view changes almost sentence to sentence.The characters don't seem real -- he's handsome, brave, and bold; she's beautiful, brave and bold. Not a single flaw between them. No hint of complexity. I don't know them and don't want to know them.I didn't get any sense of the time or the place. There's no scenery, description, landscape.And just too much telling."
3,Does any of this sound familiar?,"Oh, were to start. I really enjoy Hannah Howell books. But was it just me or was this one just a wee bit like a couple of her others?A strong male, a tiny woman, and evil man and a horrid female. It is not a good read when you already know the plot twists.Since reading the first book with Sigimor in it I was waiting for HIS book. But if I had know this is what I would have gotten, I would have gladly waited longer. It was good but, their was just no real spark. I only hope that her next novel of Liam does not leave me the same way."
2,MAJOR DISAPOINTMENT,"I am one of the biggest Hannah Howell fans in the world. I hate finishing her books because then I have to wait for the next one to be released. This book, however, is so mundane. No witty conversation, barely any humor although there are halfhearted attempts. I did not care at all about any of the characters. Usually when I read her books, I laugh, cry, sigh, etc. This time I yawned. If I didn'nt know better, I would say it was written by a ghost writer. If this is your first Hannah Howell experience, please don't give up. I have read Highland Warrior at least seven times cover to cover. There is no better author of Scottish romance;this is the only book of hers that I didn't love and I have read every one she's written. Maybe she just rushed through this one, but it was bad.....so bad."
3,Ok but lacking.,"In 1473, Laird Sigimor Cameron rushes to help Lord Peter Gerard, in England, who he owes his life to. Sigimor and his 5 friends/relatives who have traveled with him arrive too late. They are immediately thrown in the dungeon and are now waiting to be hung at dawn. Peter's Sister Jolene drugs the guards and arrives to make a deal with Sigimor and the others. She will release them if they help her escape her Uncle (who killed Peter) and keep her nephew, the heir safeThey quickly agree and start on a fast paced race to the Scottish Highlands. Along the way Jolene is taken hostage, and rescued. She overcomes the fact that she is ""English"" with these men. When she and Sigimore marry, to save her life, (or is it for love?) the sparks really start to fly.I felt as though Howell was rushed writing this one. Things didn't have the normal polish or humor of her books."
1,Hmmm...,"Yeah... I used to like these guys a lot but I think I outgrew them. Every Deicide song sounds the same to me now (except for the 'scars of the crucifix' CD). So, go out and buy their new CD, but forget their older stuff. It sucks."
1,I'm not impressed,"I've heard plenty of joke albums before, and this one just isn't funny. I mean, I get the joke...they're trying to lampoon the whole death metal thing with about a billion references to Satan and music that is laughably extreme. Okay, I get it...you throw in a thousand blast beats, tune the guitars down low and have your singer growl like a dog fighting over a bone. This mock death metal thing is being done a thousand times better by Hate Eternal, the kings of joke metal.Just not enough laughs to recommend. I'm sorry."
5,A good collection,Deicide remains the strongest of the pack. I rarely buy best of CDs but this one contains alot of great tracks and it beats changing CDs.Unlike alot of bands that sell out or soften up as they age Deicide just seems to get more and more pissed off. The review that called this a lampoon should really check his music history. Deicide was largly responsible for the resurgance of GOOD metal in the early 90s.
1,WARNING TO INDY FANS!,"I cannot stress this enough! This is not an action episode!In spite of a brief, but very welcome appearance of the original Indiana Jones, (Harrison Ford), donning his whip and fedora for the fourth time, this is one of the quietest YIJC episodes ever!The episode revolves around young Indy learning to play the saxophone and playing with a jazz band in the 1920's.There is a moment in the second half involving a murder and an action scene in a warehouse. But this is not an episode for action fans; it's an episode for jazz afficionados.I wish Ford could have leant his cameo apparance to an action-oriented episode!"
4,Fantastic concert video!,"Perhaps I am prejudiced due to my love of the music of Maria Rita, but I find this to be an outstanding concert video with many outstanding music performances slightly hampered by some erratic video. Some sustained shots of the enthusiastic crowd would have been nice, and perhaps of the band members as well. But there is no doubt as to who is the star of this show, and she sounds (and looks) marvelous! While my personal preference in her music runs more to the selections from ""Segundo"" (with its smaller, more jazz flavored band), some of which are performed here, Ms. Rita does a marvelous job with the samba style as well. I love the supportive audience, and the fact that so many fans seem to be enjoying a modern take on this classic Brazilian music. Overall, five stars for the music and three for the video production, resulting in a four star rating!"
2,Thoroughly disappointing sequel,"The Kindle edition is full of so many typos that, while still readable, it is thoroughly annoying. One short paragraph had three typos and every page seems to have at least one. The story also lacks the keen wit and insight of Love in a Cold Climate, relying instead on pratfalls and totally implausible situations more alongthe lines of Pigeon Pie. While the first two books in this series are ranked among my favorites, this book is a disappointment and not worth reading"
3,Reading spoiled by typos on each page,"This is the first book that I downloaded on Kindle and I was distracted by the number of typos on each page, so much so that I will ask for a refund. I really hope that this is not going to be the case with all ebooks. I found the story light and fluffy and amusing. It is interesting how little has changed in politics and parenting in 50 years."
3,"It's OK, but the spelling ...","The sort of follow up to Love in a Cold Climate. I preferred Love in a Cold Climate, but you can expect the same wit, human intrigue and Britishness. If you like her writing, read it.What really put me off is the spelling mistakes!!! I suspect it has something to do with the e-book version, but still ... rather annoying I'd say."
3,Satire in the 1950s,"This probably was a hit in the 50's but ""we've come a long way, baby"" and it mainly seems dated and out of touch now. I finished it but felt like I was wasting my reading time. Mainly I wanted to slap the protagonist because she was such a wimp."
3,None,"Not her best and you do need to have read her other books, which are much more engaging, less deliberately satyrical and so were simply more convincing and much warmer in tone. My main complaint is the quality of the copy. Hard to believe that Penguin would simply do an OCR on a book and then not even run a spell check over it but that seems to be what has happened here, judging by the kind of errors which abound, and get in the way of a fluent read. I emailed Penguin but they do not seem interested in the quality of this book - not good enough, refunds should be given."
3,Okaaay but Kindle version is awful,"I really like Nancy Mitford's writing style but I didn't enjoy this one anywhere near as much as ""Pursuit of Love' and 'Love in A Cold Climate'. Fanny is older now and her rather haphazard approach to life doesn't sit well with motherhood - her light hearted shallowness seems neglectful when you see how the kids turn out.Some of this I think is from the completely rubbish editing on Kindle - spaces are left out, words misspelled, etc - which makes it very hard to get swept up with the story.Perhaps a book to get if you like getting all the works of an author but if you do, get the book, not the Kindle version."
1,A terrible disappointment,"If you loved ""Love in a Cold Climate"" and ""The Pursuit of Love"", for heaven's sake DON'T read this terrible Nancy Mitford clunker.""Don't Tell Alfred"" picks up on Fanny's (ie The Bolter's Daughter) life in the late fifties/early sixties. Except for a brief appearance by Uncle Matthew, who has given up his entrenching tool in favour of a cocktail glass (!!!), none of the other characters from Ms. Mitford's earlier works appear here.Rather, the novel is populated by pop stars, dull diplomats and something called ""Teddy boys"". These uncompelling characters are further handicapped by tedious dialogue and an utterly boring plot.Completely lacking the charm and wit of ""The Pursuit of Love"" and ""Love in a Cold Climate"", this novel disappoints as much as the others delight.Sorry, Amazon, this book is No Sale."
3,I've heard better from Uli......,"Not good, not bad. Uli tries his hand at the most recorded, most played and most performed piece of music in the history of the world; Vivaldi's ""Four Seasons"". It's kinda' unique in the sense that Uli is playing this composition on his Sky Guitar, but for me it becomes rather boring after a while. If you want to hear the best version of Vivaldi's ""Four Seasons"" check out Carmignola playing it on violin (I think it was a Sony release around 2000) If you want to check out some of Uli's better work I would suggest ""Prologue to the Great Symphonic Legends"", ""Earthquake"", or any of his earlier works with the Scorpions especially ""Virgin Killer"". This CD really deserves about a two-and-a-half star rating, but because we're talking about Uli Jon Roth, I'll bump him up two three stars."
5,great journey for anyone who respect beautiful music!,"uli jon roth ( the old scorpions guitarist that amazed us between 1972-1978 with his respectable talent ) took us to his journey. he arranged and performed antonio vivaldi's concertos- "" four seasons"" ( 14 tracks included his opening and closing tracks , and created his modern masterpiece - "" metamphosis"" ( 10 tracks ) . metamorphosis tracklist included 24 tracks from one of the best virtuos guitarist- uli jon roth .uli amazed us with his beautiful solowing and his enjoyable music he created with his 7 strings- the sky guitar.if you heard his classical work before and enjoy it buy this also.if you just remembered him as the best scorpions guitarist ever you should try to listen to it first before buying it.ij you are his fan and bought his old meterials - like me take this now to your collection and never be disappointed!!!"
1,not happy,"if u expect to use this for tracing pictures from books or magazines on to a wall FORGET.instead of getting a headache to return it, i'll give it to a school. i thought you could take pictures and trace them on the wall it will not work. the review i read was like i could do that, but i found out different"
1,bulb died on 3rd day,"maybe I mismatched the bulb with the lamp, but after a couple of days the lamp flickered and died. ugh."
2,Lacking in substance,"Once I got the defective CD replaced by New Riders (something they were very quick about btw) I was able to get Debian installed with few problems. However, once it was in I found the book fairly useless, as it's coverage of many topics (such as getting XFree86 running) left me reaching for my copy of _Running Linux_. To make matters worse the book was also light on helping explain those aspects of the distribution that were peculiar to Debain. Where's the discussion of apt? I'd easily recommend one of the other Debain books over this one."
3,Fairly good introduction to Debian,"It's a fairly slim volume, but it seems to cover all of the bases for someone new to Debian. My recommendation would be: buy this book and something like ""Running Linux"", so you can combine the best of both books.Incidentally, if you got the wrong CD (disc 2 instead of disc 1), contact the publisher (New Riders) and they'll replace it free."
4,Great way to get started with Debian,"New Riders is an upstart publisher of technical books, and their creation are cut above the rest, and of about the same quality of writing, and editorial level as O'Reilly books. This book is a very nice book and CD combo, which will get you started with the free, and volunteer maintained distribution of Linux. Debian is especially notable for its package system, which allows easy, and seemless installation of new packages, or update of already installed ones over the network, and internet. (So you get the freshest possible versions from the debian site, or its mirrors.) This book not only describes all that is necessary to make a competent, and well tought out installation of Debian Linux system on your PC, but also gives enough basic usage instructions to allow new users to get up and running, and to be able to get around. Highly advised if you need a good introduction to Linux, or if you want a distribution, with good installation manual."
4,In defence of New Riders,"I bought this book only to find out after 2 hours of frustration that the CD-ROM supplied was the wrong one. I emailed the publishers who replied to me within 20 minutes; the CD-ROM, together with a brand new copy of the book arrived 5 days later having crossed the Atlantic via UPS. Okay, so New Riders made a mistake ... to paraphrase ""Good companies make mistakes; GREAT companies fix them""."
3,"Decent not great, Toss the CD","It's not a bad book, but the CD is badly damaged. I could not get it to install files to my harddisk, the paths are not what the install program thinks they should be. I haven't had time to mess with it today, but I think it will work if you use floppies to boot. And then install from the cd. Otherwise its a good first linux book, although some things could have been dealt with better, like the X section. It would be great to get more on Modems & serial ports, and some info on dealing with hardware, IRQ issues, etc. The botched CD really makes Debian look bad, which sucks because Debian GNU/Linux is absolutely the best!"
2,"Not deep enough, the supplied CD is useless.","I bought this book mostly to get Debian 2.1 release on CD. Unfortunately the CD is useless - there are some basic files missing so that you cannot complete the installation.The actual book doesn't provide enough in depth information to be really useful. It maybe helpful to a novice user, however because the CD is bad I can't see how a novice user would be able to install the system in the first place."
1,Once again poor documentation and QA,"I purchased this book hoping for more about Debian and less about Linux in general, I was disappointed in that respect. I was even more disappointed when the first pages explained how to create a boot disk, only to find out the utility and the images are not on the CD where the documentation says they are."
5,Buy this book.,"The other reviewers are spot-on with their praise. With a complex sport like karate, a student needs to have unambiguous instruction. Otherwise, the student risks learning the movements incorrectly. This series delivers informative instruction as clear as clear can be. The author carefully and brilliantly presented the material so that there is little room for doubt. Other karate books are good. This one is great. Other books can have you scratching your head, wondering what it is they're trying to say. After purchasing other books, I purchased this one as a supplement to explain what the others didn't. I realized that if I had purchased this one first, I wouldn't need another supplement.Don't be fooled by the low price. This book and the rest of the series is worth many more times the price you'll pay, especially when you consider the time and energy that goes into learning the sport.Buy this book. You'll see."
3,Hard to understand,"This text book is a racket! It is $80 to buy, EIGHTY DOLLARS for 172 page (that's including 20 pages of index)!!! I've been offered $11 to buy it back and that's the most money I can find, the lowest is $4. UNBELIEVABLE."
5,A simple way to explain an complicated technique,"I am a bigginer's in practicing the elelctron microscopy. This book provides a good introduction and important checklists during the practice of electron microscopy. Most important of all, it is not heavy."
1,Very Very Disappointing,"This is less a book about the French paradox than it is a book on how to count calories. Thanks but I didn't need to spend money to figure that out. I wanted to know more about the French approach to eating, which he only briefly covers. His 22 secrets to the French diet include such worthless memes such as exercise more. Novel! He spends a lot of time telling the reader that low-fat diets are worthless, but a bunch of recipes include low-fat and low-cal substitutes. That's a fine approach, but not one the French would use. So he should have just named this book ""How to Eat Lite with semi-French recipes"". I would not recommend this to people who want to eat like the French because while some of these are covered, it's not all that hard to look them up on the net. You're better off researching on your own and spending the money on a real French cook book."
1,Not up-to-date on current knowledge,"What a disappointment this book turned out to be. I've been reading many books on the subject of ""how"" the French eat, not just ""what"" they eat. The French don't bother with counting calories, yet this book is heavy on the calorie counting. Many of the charts in this book look like something from the 70's or 80's. I doubled-checked the copyright date, as I thought this book surely must have been written in the 80's. Nope, 1999 is the date. The pictures of prepared recipes are in black and white and do NOT look appetizing. My book is being sent back."
2,Hard Steps,"The book did not follow what appeared on the screen. So difficult to follow that we just gave it up and tried another book.Some of it was useful for reference, but step by step no way!"
3,Shipped wrong book,They shipped the wrong book but they provided acceptable solution within reasonable period of time.
1,Makes it Harder,"This does not help to learn FrontPage. It almost makes it more difficult than it already is, I gave up half way through because I found it so frustruating."
4,A great start,"I had absolutely no experience with building a website before purchasing this book and using it's lessons to learn Frontpage. After a weekend doing all of the lessons, I was able to set up the structure of a website for my department (a large radiology department), which I've been refining since. I plan to use the Frontpage 2003 Inside Out book to add more depth to what I already know.I agree with the last reviewer that the paragraph structure could be improved--I tended to lose my place going back and forth between the book and the monitor. But this is a minor complaint. The point is that if you are an absolute beginner, this is a great way to learn enough to get started, which is often the most difficult part. Other more detailed references can be used later once you understand and can work with the basic concepts. Not to mention the sense of accomplishment when you are able to see the results of your work in fairly short order!"
3,3 books on learning FrontPage 2003,"I actually bought 3 books: Microsoft FrontPage 2003 Step-by-Step, Microsoft FrontPage 2003 Inside-Out, and Que Special Edition Using FrontPage 2003.Step-by-step is a very useful starting point, but you'll soon run out of this book. By far, the best of the 3 is Que's Using FrontPage 2003 - it is excellent! FrontPage 2003 Inside-Out is good IF you're interested in Active Server Pages.But all in all - if you want to buy just one I recommend Que Special Edition Using FrontPage 2003. The format lets you learn by solving problems that you run into. For example, you want find out about Banners, the book not only answers your questions but gives you the background and advise on using the feature. And the author is very candid about suggesting when to use and NOT use a particular feature. The authors obviously have used the product for real-world web sites and really wanted to share their experiences and knowledge."
1,Provides Only a Spefic Example Included on The CD,"Does not provide directions for ""Step-by-Step"" creation of your own original web site. It continously refers to the example on the included CD so you recreate that website.Poorly written and confusing. Do not waste your money if you are trying to build a custom website."
5,A blend of quizzes for self-testing and insights into how English works,"If English is your second language and you can't figure out the inconsistencies of grammar, Basic American Grammar And Usage: An ESL/EFL Handbook is for you. Fifteen easy chapters avoid the usual theory and focus on applied written and spoken American-style English, offering a blend of quizzes for self-testing and insights into how English works. Guidelines include sentences, clauses, standard conventions, relative pronouns, and more: many an English speaker will also find this a solid refresher course on usage."
2,Confusing first chapter,"So far I've read Chapter 1. I have not found it to be as clearly written as I had expected. I teach ESL, and ""modal verbs"" and ""complements"" are too much at this early level. I find myself reorganizing the material to make it more easily understood. I underlined important parts of sentences. Sometimes the author titles well, but at other times he uses titles like ""Jumbled"" and ""Organized."" Then for confusion, on page 3: ""A compound sentence is a sentence made up of two or more sentences, not clauses, linked together by words such as 'and' and 'or' called conjunctions."" On page 17 he writes: ""Compound sentences are formed by joining two independent clauses with a conjunction."" Which is it?"
5,Excellent Service,I could not have improved this transaction at all. I ordered the product and received it in very good time. The book was exactly what I ordered and in excellent condition. 5-stars easily!
1,Caution - Not large enough for S2,"This is bag is not for the S2. It may be 5 Star for cameras that it is made for. However, contrary to some ratings, I found the bag too tight for my S2 and there is certainly not enough room for a mini tripod with it! Be aware that the S1 is smaller than the S2. I would not recommend ordering this for an S2."
4,"Good, But the front is to small","The bag is large and looked nice, but the front small bag is too small so that I can't put the charger and another battery in."
4,TAMRAC 5693 DIGITAL 3,"I bought this case for my Canon S3IS, it has a good quality construction, and the camera fits very good, the only complain that I have is that I wanted a handle in the top of the case like the Lowepro Edit 100, I used this case but I lost it, then I bought the Tamrac. Before buying this case, compare it with the Lowepro Edit 100, even when the Lowepro defines this one for a small videocamera, a camera like the Canon S3IS, or similar, fits perfect and the price is better. You can find the Lowepro here at Amazon. I hope this help you to decide. Make your own comparations."
2,Tiny,"I should have compared the measurements of the camera (Powershot S1 IS) to the bag before purchasing this, but I ordered them together and didn't find out how small this bag is until it arrived. The bag itself is well constructed, but it is an extremely tight squeeze to fit the camera in. The front pocket does hold 4 AA batteries and a spare SD card without a problem, but that's about all. If you plan on attaching the neck strap to your Powershot S1 IS, I recommend you don't get this bag."
5,"Finally, the perfect case for my Canon S3 IS","I've been searching online for a snug, well-padded, lightweight case for my camera because I like to bring it around in my bag everyday ""just in case."" As soon as I opened the package I thought it looked cute - compact and well-padded all around. My Canon S3 IS fits perfectly inside with enough room to pack in the neck strap on top (if you want to keep it on the camera) and there's room for at least 4 AA batteries, extra memory, and the USB cable. I don't think you'd be able to fit the battery charger unless you have a really compact one.I highly recommend this bag. I believe your S3 will be well protected. It comes with a long body strap (unlike the Canon case made for this camera) so you can wear it across your chest or on your shoulder and it barely weighs a thing.Awesome bag, thank goodness for Tamrac. I found it for [...] with no shipping costs so keep your eyes peeled for deals. :)"
3,Too snug for the Canon S2 IS,"This case is very well made and designed. However, for the Canon S2 IS, the fit is too tight. Yes, the eyepiece gets in the way from easily sliding in, and once it's in, there is absolutely no room to spare. You need to use two hands to pry it back out. Also, if you have the strap attached to the camera, too much effort is needed to shove everything into the bag. An alternative I found is the Case Logic TBC4. It is a pretty compact camera bag with an outside pocket and 2 outside mesh pockets. Sears carries this bag for $14.99 and is a much better alternative for the Canon S2 IS. I am rating the bag 5 stars because it is one of the better bags on the market, but as rated in association with the Canon S2, it only gets 2 stars."
4,Angela shines in Nocturnes,"I found Angela Hewitt's interpretation of the Chopin Nocturnes quite lovely -- well-considered and thoughtfully executed. Her program notes on the works alone are worth the cost of the CD. They are not as passionate as some other versions but very enjoyable. The real gem on this CD, however, is the ""Fantaisie-Impromptu"" at the end. It is incomparable in clarity, dynamics, and excitement. All other versions I've heard, no matter how passionate, sound monochromatic when set against Ms. Hewitt's. This is a ""must own"" interpretation."
2,Quad Base Cane,"Quality is poor - not a steady support device.Everyone who tries it, uses words like ""junky"" to describe the feel and appearance of this item.Unstable and wobbly. Just what you don't need when you're using a cane to keep from falling."
3,Cane,My mother likes the cane so far. But it took a very long time for it to get here. I probably won't order again from this company.
5,Product,This cane is a good product and my wife who uses it loves lt. It stands up so you don''thave to bend over to pick it up.Sold and sent by Amazon. Delivered in three days .
2,wobbles,"This product should support a person probably, however, it wobbles when you hold on it, not save for anyone who needs a cane. I filed a return and will not recommend this product to anyone."
2,Walking cane,"The cane is ok but it took ages to get here. Actually the canes is too short. In total, I'm basically dissatisfied with this product and the retailer."
3,Disappointing,"For a book about a werewolf, there's not much attention paid to what it's like to BE a werewolf, other than the need to undress and chant the magic words. There are only the briefest encounters between Ross in wolf form and Megan. So why bother having Ross be a werewolf? He could have just been a regular guy.The trouble is, if he's a regular guy, then there's no magical attraction to make Ross and Megan come together. And aside from that magical attraction there's not much development of a relationship. Instead there was a lot of time spent detailing Ross's past and why he's so determined to avoid getting romantically involved.I finished it, but won't be reading more."
5,Loved it!,"This is what a werewolf novel is supposed to be like! The character development was good, the storyline was interesting, and the romance was HOT! While a bit far-fetched as to the explaining of the werewolf gene....let's face it, were talking about werewolves here, you can't get much more far-fetched than that! I really enjoyed the private detective angle also. I liked this one enough to order the rest of her series. If you like were-novels, then I would definately suggest giving this one a look!"
5,A great werewolf novel!,"For the most part this was a fun book to read. There was one small subplot that I thought a bit pointless at the end, but it was still worth the 5 star rating. If you have never read a werewolf romance, try this for a start.!"
4,not enough action,This is the first book that I have read by Rebecca York. I agree with the other reviews for Killing Moon. I loved the way York put the book together. Her writing style and the way she would describe things. The only thing I thought it was lacking was a little more action. Most of it happened towards the end of the book. I also wish that she would have done more with Ross the werewolf. Maybe added to that part of the story. It seemed the only time she wrote about the werewolf was when it was in the woods or attacking someone. All in all I really liked it and I am looking foward to reading the other two.
1,"Dull, drab, boring, etc.","Killing Moon can be summed up very easily... boring. I must have read a different book than those who stated this book was a ""fast paced page turner"". After reading this book I will NOT be investing more time/money into the remaining books in this series.The story bounced around so much it was nearly impossible to follow. I am unable to provide a brief synopsis of the plot because even after reading it I still don't know what exactly this book was about. Ross and Megan who were supposed to be the main characters were robbed. This book focused on every detail in explaining secondary characters, sub plots and the occupations of characters the main characters and main plot suffered greatly.For those who enjoy paranormal romance and werewolves I would not recommend this book, it lacks in just about every capacity."
5,kept me reading,"She did it again! Another book I couldn't put down, and love her characters. Her discriptions are excellent! I will deffinately be buying more of her books."
3,"Killing Moon (The Moon Series, Book 1) by Rebecca York","This is about a werewolf named Ross and Megan who works for Bio Gen a research facility for DNA type testing. The premise of the story was good, Megan goes to Ross' house to do a blood test and get his genetic line. She finds him naked on the floor bleeding and out of his mind. She being a former physician decides to stay and help him. He has been shot. She nurses him for days and he comes around. The story really takes off from there with a serial murderer Ross is trying to catch and Megan getting caught up in all the action. The problem I had with the story was the character building or lack of it. We really don't see too much about Ross and he seems almost distant like the author didn't want to give to much of his personality away. He seemed a bit bland to me. Megan on the other hand had a little more depth to her. I would have liked to have seen the author build Ross' character a bit better and make him more interesting."
3,Could have been better,"Not bad. The overall storyline was good, but it was a little to melodramatic and soap operaish. The dialog left a lot to be desired. There were a lot of exchanges like this: ""Ross."" ""Megan."" ""Ross!"" ""Megan!"" ""Oh God, Ross!"" I kept wishing they would say more than each other's names. Also, some of the things they did seemed a bit unrealistic, or unreasonable. I'm still not sure why Ross felt he needed to search Megan's house, and I was a bit creeped out by his lingering over her stuff. Yeah, I get that he was supposed to have chosen her as his ""mate,"" and that no other woman will do, and he will always want her so when he thought it was over he was despondent blah, blah. But, I don't know...that move seemed a bit desperate and needy, and I guess I don't like my alpha guys desperate and needy to the point where they start to resemble a creepy stalker."
2,when will it end?!,as a hardcore werewolf fan i found it interesting at first but all the forced magical bonding and the avoiding it got irritating fast. it was so irritating that i either wanted to scratch my eyes out or rip the book in to tiny pieces and 'scream get over it!' in frustration... yet my love of werewolves made me finish the book as painful as that was. You'd think someone born a werewolf even if raised in a bad family would except what he was better then this. as the first romance novel i've bothered to read i really hope not all romance novels are like this.
2,Fair!,"Easy readers from Ohio. Not everyone has the same opinion on books! I read it, I liked it. Some of the information is right on, but most of it is way off. I have read several books on relationships and astrology, this one is ok. It's not better than ""Astrology for lovers, by Olivia"" or "" Seduction by the stars"", but it's ok. I strongly feel that people need to read several books before they find the one that really appeals to them. As for me, this one was alright, but it didn't quite do the job."
5,Checked out my new lover,I had an internet romance going and wondered what the guy was really like. I looked his birthdate up in this darling little book and learned he was as wonderful as his emails. I've used it for a lot of information about the people I work with too. I just bought the author's new book ASTROLOGY ON THE JOB.
3,Interesting.,"Reading this book was a pleasant experience. I read the customer reviews prior to adding my own comments... I thought it was interesting. It pretty much covered my past and present relationships with accuracy ( I did feel it was a little inacurate in some parts. The book does have it's weaknesses and I have read some books on astrology and personal relationships that were better than this one, but this book is not bad at all. I do recommend it to readers, especially those who are not very familiar with Astrology. If I could recommend other good books to read, they would be "" Seduction by the stars"" and ""The Astrology of Sexuality"". This second book"" gives accurate interpretations, which are all about a page and a half long."
1,Does not relate to me or any of my relationships.,"This is the first book of this kind that I have ever bought. A friend of mine is into astrology, so I thought I would give this book a try. I was quite disappointed. This personal relationship guide was way off in my opinion. The adive given to me about partners was opposite of what I have experienced, even topics about myself were off. I'm sure there's many books on astrology and relationships out there and I'll just have to keep looking because this one just didn't do it for me."
2,"somewhat interesting, but not as good as some of her others","This book was somewhat worth reading, but it was not as good as some of her other books. This one seems to leave out alot of useful information and somehow gave me the impression that Carolyn is lacking in her perspective of spiritual knowledge. I can't rely on this Astrological guide only because it is not totally acurate. I have read her other books and walked away content, but not this one. I guess, I just expected ehr books to get better and better, not the other way around."
1,Not believable,"Boy, what a joke! If I went by what this book says, I'd end up with a women who was so totally wrong for me. I studied astrology in college and I'm drawn to it, but I would have to be a fool to think this book can dictate my love life, sorry I don't buy it!"
4,Not as good as season 1,"I find this season to be lacking compared to the first. This season the story quality really takes a hit. Visual quality is up, but the story is just not that great. Character development is more thrown in just to take up time. Wish it was better, but it is not that bad. There are worse, way worse."
4,Great Product!,Love the bluray format. The anime was a little unguided and should have focused more on the Triela character but I suppose that it is more important to follow the manga.
4,Time,I have been waiting to get this item for a month and it still hasn't showed up. It would be nice to get it one of these days.
1,Gunslinger Girl 2 is almost unwatchable.,"I cannot stress enough, watch the first one a give this one a skip. I you have watched the first one then you have already seen all the good parts of Teatrino. It is like watching a one year old remake a great work."
2,Bbbbbboooorrrrriiiiinnnngggg ..... (T_T),I found this Pocket Pixter at a Discount store for $10 bucks and I bought it bcuz I thought it'd be as neat as the big pixter but actually this thing is boring and a waste of money even if I paid only $10 it's not even worth that never-the-less retail price. All you can do is draw with it and play a boring game where you gotta get across the street to get to the other side. Nothing else besides that. For $10 bucks I'd rather add to that money and get myself a Tamagotchi V3. Which I already have but who says you can't have more. My advice is don't buy this thing ! Find something more entertaining to buy that this thing. It's not worth it !!!
1,Outrageously Overpriced!!,I bought this last year at Wal-Mart for $15.00 and was looking for another for my cousin's little girl but no way am I paying an outrageous price like this for a toy.Amazon should put a stop to these third party sellers that are trying to take advantage of people with these ridiculus prices.I'll be looking elsewhere for this item
4,oathbound 1,I enjoyed the book and passed it on to a young cousin who was thrilled with it. A great book with an entertaining idea. I would definitely buy it again.
1,a sad waste of time and money,"Valdemar is a fun place to visit, but not in this book.Boring!Didn't like the characters, didn't like their situations or adventures.oh well....."
5,Characters You Can Love.,I love the main characters in this novel. They compliment each other yet they are so different. This was one of the easiest Valdemar novels to read. Potentionally one of the best novels in the series. This set is different than many of the other novels in the Valdemar series.
5,Multiple copies,"That's how much I love this book and the two that go with it..... I have them in paperback, and when they were no longer readable, I bought them again in ebook! The Oathbound is a good backstory to the Heralds of Valdemar series, and I enjoyed reading it and seeing how it tied into the Heralds and what happened early in the Kingdom...."
5,It was AWESOME!!!!!,"It was a really good book, it kept me going 'till the end! I loved Tarma & Kethry-- they are the perfect heroines. One of Mercedes Lackey's best books!"
4,a really exciting book,I thought the Oath Bound was great book. Mercedes Lackey did a really great job on it. The heros are fun.
2,Really a short story collection,"The description doesn't make clear that this is actually what's sometimes called a ""paste-up"" book. It's really a collection of previously published short stories just strung together as chapters in a book. For me, this makes for some tedious reading.It's bad enough that the characters get re-introduced at the beginning of each story, and there's a lot of rehashing of past exploits. (This was, of course, necessary when the stories were being published separately.) The worst part is that there's very little overarching storyline. Don't expect an epic such as in The Last Herald-Mage series, or even a coherent book-long story as in By the Sword.Of course, Oathbreakers is more of the same."
5,One of her best books!!!,"It's amazing, lol. I loved all the tid-bit of words in Tarma's native tounge. It has an excellent plot and the book just keeps getting better as you read on. For those people who didnt give this book 5 stars, you need to re-read this book and find out what you missed, because you must not have gotten it all. One of the best book ever written along with all the rest of the Valdemar books. makes me wish I could travel to valdemar!"
5,american images,a most beautiful book of balck and white images of americans. this book looks and feels like a collector's item. a great coffee table book
4,Bourdieu in North America,"Many of the essays are well worth reading; indeed, the last essay, Bourdieu's own contribution, makes essential reading. A persistent sub-theme in the collection is Bourdieu's North-American reception and the concomitant appropriation of his work by literary and cultural-studies scholars as well as sociologists. Bourdieu's commentary on this phenomenon is a brilliant piece of rhetoric; the primary grounds on which it can be criticized are, ironically, his own. Its very imperfections, e.g. its distorted understanding of the U.S. intellectual field, turn out precisely to prove his point about the incommensurability of knowledges produced within different institutional configurations. ""Proving him wrong"" about his North American perception would only, in the larger context, prove him right! -------------------------"
3,A Little Dissappointed,"I was a little dissappointed with this book. The author never really got down into the guts of the worldbuilding topic. It teaches the logistics of star systems and orbits and stuff, but it doesn't talk about what happens down on a specific world.The bottom line: the book would've been better if you had focused more on what happens on the planet rather than in the solar system."
4,Keeping SiFi fiction writers REAL,A great resource for any one writing science fiction that wants to stay within the realm of known science. Not for those who have no science background.
4,enjoyable read,Picked this book up as a reference for beginning my own SF book. Enjoyed it. Has some good info presented in a understandable manner.
5,Useful Book,"This book explores and details assorted aspects of world-building, some that I hadn't considered previously. Going through it's questionnaire helped me flesh out and enliven my fantasy planets. Well done!"
5,Great resource!,"World-building is the book everyone is looking for without knowing it until they've found it. Clear and concise (if sometimes a tiny bit dry), Gillett is a user-friendly guide for the novice in creating believable new worlds. Setting influences everything about a story, and good settings can generate so many ideas for stories -- it's great to have a resource that helps you get it right!"
5,Helped me Find My Job,"I didn't have a clue where to start to look for a paralegal job. I have been in this field for five years at one job and was out of touch with what's going on in the marketplace. I picked up this book and found everything I needed - from resume writing to what to expect in the interview to hidden meanings behind the questions asked. I also found the salary negotiation section extremely helpful. When I went on my final interview, I found that I was able to use some of the techniques successfully. The book gave me resources I hadn't even thought about. I think that I was able to get my job more quickly by reading this book. I highly recommend it to experienced, non-experienced paralegals and even those just thinking about entering the field. Now that I think about it, it can apply to just about anyone!"
3,I was in platoon 1036 and am in this book.,"My name is Andrew R. Townshend and I went through Marine Corps boot camp in 1985 as a member of 1st battalion, B company, platton 1036. This book tells it like it was. If you want to know what the toughest recruit training in the United States Armed forces is like, this book will tell you all you want to know. You can find my name in the list of recuits in the first few pages of the book. Semper Fi."
4,What it is like!,"I have worked with several former DI's who seem to be very nice, regular guys on the job. I have often talked with them about their experiences as a Marine Corps Drill Instructor and their stories are fascinating and consistent. As I was reading this very entertaining and informative book, I would talk with coworkers who trained at Parris Island and their accounts were very similar to the events described in this book. Any prospective enlistee can safely use this book to help them decide if the military is appropriate for them, or if they are enlisting for the wrong reasons."
4,Boot,My son and I read this book shortly before my son went to boot camp. The book practically followed what he went through exactly on a day to day basis possibly spoiling the whole experience and surprise factor of boot camp. Very detailed.
4,Big hit with pre-teen boys!,"I purchased this as a gift for a pre-teen with aspirations to have a career in the military. His reaction to this gift was just over-the-top excitement.According to him, this volume had everything that he was looking for.I suspect that if he was a little older, and actually nearing a decision to inlist, a more sophisticated and updated source of information would be necessary. For its intended audience, this was perfect."
4,Excellent Book,"I am currently in the Marine Corps. This book gives a good image of the Corps in the early 80's, but Making the Corps gives a better modern look at Marine Corps boot camp."
4,"If you want to be a Marine, this is the book for you!","This fast-paced book starts off with yellow foot-prints painted on the ground, and doesn't slow down until the Eagle, Globe and Anchor are awarded at graduation. From Forming, to Warrior Week, this book truly has it all! If you see Parris Island in your future, this book is an essential!"
4,Attention anyone who thinks they can become a Marine!,"Boot is a must read for anyone who is considering a career in the Marine Corps. Daniel Da Cruz takes an in depth look at the rigors of Marine Corps Basic Training. From the first week of in-processing, to pugil stick training, to snapping in, to close order drill, Da Cruz makes every week sound amazing. Letters from recruits are particularly interesting because they show what the recruits are feeling from week to week, from one training phase to the next. As a future Marine Officer, this book gives me an insight into what my future Marines will go through on their way to becoming one of America's fighting elite."
3,Disappointed,"I thought that this book follows some recruits thru boot camp.When I read this book they mention some recruits and their problems going thru boot camp.This book however presented in considerable detail the process of becoming a Marine and associated information about such things as the process to become a drill instructor. As a civilian, this was sometimes a little too much detail. Overall , I still would recommend this book if you are a military buff or just interested in the Marines."
2,Not As Shown in the Picture !!,"This is one item on Amazon, where amazon shows one thing and ships another.The Bag I received is NOT AS SHOWN !!!I only received the bag shown in the Certer. When I called up, I was told that ""its a wrong picture perhaps....pl return it if you dont want it"" - Even after a month of my complain, the picture remains the same.The bag itself is pretty good and I use it to store my Minolta 7HI, but listed as it is on Amazon it deserves only 2 stars for dashing my hopes (read it as BAIT & SWITCH )."
4,The Monster,"I only gave this a three star rateing because it's not in color and it's a silent, just like any other flick that was made before 1927. Other then this, it is comical."
4,Pros and Cons on this one,Pros : a GREAT book for people just getting started into airbrushing. Now for the CONS: It does not give in depth important information that it really needs to have. The section on masking for one should have much more information. Another I think the cleaning of your equipment could be a bit better.
4,Moving Zen,This book gives a well written account of an individual who endeavored to immerse himself in a new culture and discipline. He writes clearly and succinctly without the usual over admiration for things Eastern.
5,a great book,"a wonderful look at karate, japan, and life. i would recommend this to any person in the world. the best book on karate ever written."
5,Got doubts about the efficacy of spiritual healing?,"I learned to respect the honest, scholarly approach of Robert Peel in his fascinating 3-part biography of Mary Baker Eddy. He doesn't disappoint with this fascinating review of spiritual healing in the modern age. Anyone curious about the efficacy of spiritual healing would be fascinated by this book and profit from it. I'm amazed that such a helpful book is now out of print."
2,Very basic and rough drawings.,"Infact this one desrves only one star.This book is (almost) worthles for a professional designer.There are many good fonts out there (free as well) which have much better symbol characters.The symbols in this collection is old, incomplete, not standard.There are no airport symbols. The cars used at the traffic symbols can only be seen at museums.There is nothing creative in this collection.A clever graphic designer can find better symbols easily and for free.Pepin pres says that you can use the cd with many software but there are no vector based formats in ANY of their CD collections including this one.I think Amazon.com too should add this comment about vector based files too because the book introductions are misleadng."
5,"groundbreaking mix,like a extra heavy faith no more!!!!!!!","these guys are into funk,rap,hip hop and definetly thrash metal they came years before this new wave of rap metal monkeys.around in the begining with faith no more but they are much more metal and not so out there on pluto.bay area thrash with a funky beat to boot,very heavy!"
3,Fun and Sweet,"After reading The Trouble with Mary which I thought was hilarious I bought Annie's story and read it in one afternoon. Altho it was amusing, it was not as hilarious at Mary's story. It is however enjoyable, and you root for Annie and Joe (especially Joe) all the way thru. Joe's faimily is a riot. Ethic humor is great; Joe is delicious and Annie was a tug at a mother's heartstrings (and patience). Altho 15 years was a long time for them to finally get together, and Joe's leaving the priesthood was a bit too quick and easy for reality, everything turned out the way one would expect this type of book to end. A nice, comfortable read for a rainy afternoon."
3,High Expectations?,"After reading The Trouble with Mary and enjoying it immensely, I believe my expectations for this novel was too high. Although the story was an enjoyable one, it does not come close to capturing the magic I felt with ""Mary's"" story.There are quite a few funny moments and the fact that Annie and Joe are finally able to go through life and end up where they should have been 15 years ago was an interesting tale but getting there was a struggle for both."
1,Oy Vey!,This book tries to hard. It tries to be funny and hip and ends up being over the top and sad. Sort of like an old lounge singer.Joe leaving the preisthood because he wanted to have... Annie just didn't work for me. And the part where he bought black satin sheets was just plain icky.
1,Bad !!!!!!!!!!!!!,"The book is not coherent, not organized and does not achieve its goal .I cannot find any reason wht should anyone buy this book ."
