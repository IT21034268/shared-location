4,Excellant C.D.,The Pace Is Glacial is definately the kind of C.D. that grows on you. It's some of the best music I've heard from a relatively unknown band. This is the first of their cd's that I bought and based on most of the songs I'll probably get another. A word of warning if you only like hard rock don't get this cd.
2,Naive (Or Agenda Driven?),The author cannot seem to grasp that there is much discontent amongst the people. She swallows the Islamic doublespeak about women's rights but I'm sure she wouldn't tolerate one tenth of what Iranian women must endure.Also she is fixated on being a blonde in Iran. Weird.
4,Very enjoyable,"Ms. Sciolino has written a fascinating book about the last 25 years in Iran. I didn't want to put it down.My 2 complaints are that: 1)she portrays Iran's reformists as simply victims of the system and 2)all her female interviewees are connected to the Establishment and present rather a one-sided view.Nevertheless, it's a very good read."
1,Garbage !!,Extermely pro Islamic regime and Anti people. The author interviews people associated with the establishment and decides that may be life isn't all that bad in Iran !!! She ignores the ordinary people who constitute the overwhelming majority of Iran and their stuggle for simple things that people take for granted in the west. What a shame !!!
5,Why don't the state department pundits write/think as well?,"Very well versed book by a non-Iranian who comes very close to being an Iranian. I appreciate all the hard work that Ms. Sciolino has put into creating this great work. I wished that the state department pundits use this book along with two other very well written books recently published about Iran- Abbas Milani's book about Hoveyda and Robin Wright's book- before saying anything about Iran. As a professional, I am amazed how little these people actually know about Iran and how little they even try to understand that culture. If they had done so, maybe Iran-US relations was in a better shape than it is right now. Ms. Sciolino has done a maginificant job understanding many positives and some negatives in Iranian's culture.My many thanks to her and I look forward to many more of her writings about Iran in NYT and elsewhere."
5,"A marvellous story, beautifully written of a complex nation and country","I thoroughly enjoyed this book. Being from the region, I could relate to the anecdotes that fill this book on Iranian political thought, religiosity and culture. A complicated nation that seems to be more confused about its own identity than outsiders are of its external intentions, Iran is portrayed in a balanced, articulate, sensitive, detailed and personalized manner by Sciolino. Recommend it to anyone interested in Iranian society and psyche."
1,Worthless,"If you speak Spanish, you don't need this book. The vocabulary is so basic that the definitions wouldn't teach much to a 10-year-old. If you don't speak Spanish, then you need an English-Spanish dictionary, which this is not.My wife is from Monterrey, Mexico. She got so frustrated with the book that she finally just left it in one of my bookcases. But it didn't do me any good, either, even though I'm a native English speaker. Every word we looked up simply wasn't there.If you want a good Spanish-only dictionary, check out ""Diccionario Larousse Del Espanol Moderno : A New Dictionary of the Spanish Language"" by Ramon Garcia-Pelayo Y Gross. We bought this one later, and it's quite serviceable, though still a little incomplete. Check out my review there for more info on it."
4,Great detector...but with one flaw :(,I love this thing and although its' USB connection stopped working after I updated it (seems to be an ongoing issue with the few first batches) it is well worth the money. Hands down the best detector I've owned and it has saved me from a few tickets!!
1,Very Expennsive and Very Lousy Performance!,"Got this radar detector and had high hopes for it because of the GPS and anti false alarm sensitivity.Unfortunately in my first week I got a nasty speeding ticket. The officer had a laser gun and it didn't warn me until it was right in front of me. With this kind of protection who needs protection at all?Sure the slim unit looks great, and I like the talking radar but at the end of the day don't you buy this to avoid tickets? My friend swears by his Valentine, which looks ugly, but really who cares about the looks of a radar detector."
3,Watch Out - Model Is Upgrading to 9500ix,Nice detector but the Escort 9500ix is already coming out with 'enhanced' features. I just bought my 9500i a few days ago and it works well. I have owned multiple Escorts over the years. Wish I had known the detector was being upgraded so soon.
5,Quick to alert,"My experiance is that the Escort Passport 9500I is a great detector. I received it as a Christmas Gift to use with my new 2008 Ford Mustang GT500. Went on a weekend trip to a small town in Illinois and noticed that a pickup truck, a 1/2 a mile ahead of me, hit his breaks after I was already alerted and had slowed down. So this proves I got the alert before he did. I've owned three Passport detectors and have loved them all. I especially like that the display shows your speed when radar is detected, and that you can mark ""false alerts"". I would recommend this detector to anyone."
2,Disappointed,"I bought the 9500i and also the Valentine One, intending to use them both and send back the one I didn't like. The 9500i went back today. The GPS lockout feature is useful and innovative, but as a detector this unit does not work well.False alarms for laser are a daily occurrence, usually just as I turn a corner to face into the sun. The thing will screech, and before the voice-over comes in, I've taken to saying to myself, ""Bright Sunlight Alert!""The radar detection is not as good as on the V1, and lack of a rear antenna (to provide directional data) in my opinion is a critical flaw."
1,Useless and Expensive,"I have owned this product over a year and used it occassionally on long drives. Last week of June I went long driving and on an isolated highway in Wyoming I got pulled over and cited for speeding. The passport 9500i was on the windshield all this time and did not even make a single sound or any indication that it picked up the radar of the trooper. I asked the trooper to validate what equipment he used and it was radar not laser. If it was laser maybe that would be an excuse for the company that makes the radar, but it's an old device and my very expensive detector did not do a darn thing to warn me. DO NOT BUY , DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS PRODUCT."
1,HORRIBLE. Save your money.,"Waste of money and time. All the positive reviews have to be employees. This radar detector is the worst thing I have ever bought. I have had it two weeks now (unfortunately not returnable). There are soooo many false alerts, it will drive you crazy! You don't get 5 minutes of peace and quiet. Who wants a radar detector that picks up EVERY signal in the vacinity. And you can't block false alerts, after a point it just tells the device to 'mute'. then it comes back in 3 minutes, until you unplug it. I think it was invented and sold by the police dept, because there are so many false signals you just end up ignoring it, so you will never know which one was in your path. Save your money, time and peace of mind."
2,Escort Passport 9500i Radar,"This was a Christmas gift. Out of 10 I would rate this a 6 because it doesn't pick up all police vehicles and bands and when it does, they are right there on you. I did extensive research on it before purchasing. It has great features, but don't believe the hype!"
5,Prepare yourself for happiness and fulfillment,"What a great book. This is one of the fastest reading books regarding personal development, yet clearly delivering a very important life success concept. Adopting the concept conveyed here into your life is absolutly necessary if you want to live in harmony with that which is most important to you each and every day.This book is much more than just more information, it lays out how you can live happy and satisfied every day through supporting what is most meaningful to you.Jim Steffen uses the story of a couple discovering and integrating the ""Aligned Thinking"" process in such a way that you can do the same.The most important thing is that you can go beyond just reading the enlightening story and use it as your own action guide to impliment the concept in your life.Great growth tool,John"
2,Useful information...but....,"If you like stories written at a 5th grade level, you might enjoy this book. I find this approach tiresome and annoying. I prefer tightly presented information that doesn't require me to wade through simulated conversations of slow-witted, idealistic characters.When I eventually found my way to the actual content, I found it to be useful although I can't say it's much different than what I learned from Stephen Covey's 7 Habits."
4,Make Every Moment Count,"Aligned thinking has forced me to value and consider the remaining time I have to live on this earth.It is wonderfully satisfying to come to grips with what I want to do, with what I am willing to put my actions towards and try to make every moment count.Thank you Dr Steffen for helping an old man see this and giving purpose to his life.Pete Scalzo"
5,This Book Will Make You Think,"""This book will make you think about our life and how we are spending our time"" - Lenny Laskowski, author of the National Best Seller, ""10 Days to More Confident Public Speaking"""
4,Great book,The dummies books always tend to be good. This is a good book if you want some basic knowledge of computer support. I've used it as giveaways for my Tech Support Forums website. Everyone seemed to like it.
4,Upgrading & Fixing PCs For Dummies (Upgrading & Fixing Pcs for Dummies),Great book for wanna be computer geeks. Helps a lot.Donto
2,Upgrading and Troubleshooting for Dummies 6th Edition,Really only for someone who knows nothing about computers. Very basic information.
3,start with a NEW computer,The first thing I learned from this book was that I should not even bother upgrading my current computer.
2,Not worth it.,"I bought this book because I thought I would be able to learn how to repair or set-up my own computer equipment. The book talks mainly on what a cable looks like -useless- more than the actual settings. Also, they have a little ""conversation"" paragraph in each chapter that attempts to relate to the reader but I found that little paragraph also useless because ""hello!"" we don't care to know how frustrating it is all this because we- computer novices- already know what it feels like. I was interested in setting up my Roku box to my computer and the book told me that unless I had an HD TV, which I don't, the setting wouldn't be possible! I had to pay a computer geek to install my Roku box to my old TV with a simple connection setting. Arrrrgh. I wished I hadn't bought this book because it was simply such a waste of my money."
2,"Upgrading, Fixing PCs for Dummies, 6th Edition",Gave lower rating because didn't have detailed info on replacing laptop harddrive. Other info OK. VMV
3,Instructive Books,"I find your inventory of instructive books satisfies my need to learn self help for solving a lot of problems. My recent purchase of ""Upgrading and Fixing Computers For Dummies"", produced very quick results. I needed to upgrade my computers memory and with the help of the book did so successfully, immediately."
2,Very expensive for a CD and mini-book,"The music is great, however very expensive for $40. If you are mostly interested in the music, spend the $40 on buying the best albums from which these tracks were selected from. Disappointing that it's only a single CD. I would have expected a book from a label come with at least two.The 'book' is an interesting collection of pictures (several Photoshop'ed for entertainment value) and some random writings. This is not a coffee-table book. It's the size of a CD and about twice as thick as a standard jewel case. When I first opened it, it literally feel apart into two pieces (which it obviously wasn't supposed to do).I give the 'book' one star and the CD three, for an average of two. If this cost, say, $15 or maybe $20 it would be worth it. But $40? For a single CD and a CD sized book filled with random content? No, don't bother unless you are a hard-core fan trying to gather collectibles."
4,"Because i like this, does this make me a creep?","Amy Annelle, lead singer of The Places, has a very interesting mellow voice and the tones of this album suit her perfectly. Darker themes run throughout the album , which has some elements of country and psychedelia in a modern format of music. Certainly not the kind of music i'd consider ""catchy"" it is more of a kind of album which grows with you over time to where you can appreciate the many different good things she has done on this album."
4,A bit different,"All of the other poker books I've read up to this point have focused on a combination of gameplay and history. Poker as Life is the first to address the rest of the world in table terms.I am the type of person who finds it strange if someone doesn't gamble, and even stranger if they don't play cards. For me games of chance hold a special place in my heart and have taught me much about myself and others. The author of this book must feel the same, because in the 101 rules that make up the book he outlines the inalienable truths you learn when the chips are down.Most people who are new to poker probably only have the stuff on TV as a reference, and that's a shame. Poker as Life gives you a glimpse of the beauty of the game and just what it can teach you."
2,God awful,"I only bought this one because no one else had reviewed it who could warn me. So take this as your warning. God awful. Technically very shaky camera, extraneous noise, noticable voice dubs, amateur acting, no defined story line. I don't think one scene was ever rehearsed ahead of time. Next time, please do that. Although, to be fair, I could only get through about a half hour of it before I couldn't take it anymore.I know it's an amateur film and a zero budget thing, but it's not something I recommend sitting through unless you like that sort of thing."
3,Depth lacking clarity,"An interesting excursion into television theory, with practical explanations on the reading and interpreting of waveforms, vectorscopes, and the like, apparently written for non engineers (like me). However, this book is handicapped by inconsistent sentence structure, puzzling and sometimes incoherent explanations, strange jumps in logical thought, and (for American readers) the unusual way some English writers tend to express themselves in print. Especially engineers. This promising book would be worth its... price if it had been edited for clarity and grammer. Unfortunately, although its seems like there is a lot of useful and practical information in this book, solving the logical and gramatical puzzles to dig it out takes too much effort."
4,My 4yr old loves it,"I personally think this is a waste of money, but my 4yr old can't get enough of it. She wants to take it everywhere she goes. I guess with alot of imagination anything could be great. Out of all of the very expensive gifts she got for Christmas she puts this one at the top. I hope all kids get as much out of this as she does."
5,Grandmother's review of Play n Carry Skywishes Pony,I bought this as a Christmas present for our almost 3 year old granddaughter and as soon as she unwrapped it she couldn't wait to get it out of the box and into it's backpack so she could carry it around for the rest of the afternoon! It seemed to be a really big hit with her. The only thing her parents commented on was that the pony's voice was alittle strange sounding to them. But our grandaughter was really enjoying playing with it. Definitely a winner for her age group.My Little Pony Play-N-Carry Skywishes Pony
2,Expensive pony that doesn't do much,"My daughter (3 1/2) wanted this for Christmas after seeing it advertised. It only has a couple of things that it says, and will move it's legs around like a baby being tickled. She does love that the play mat becomes a backpack so she can tote her pony around, but for almost $50 I expected this toy to do more. Better to get two or three non-mechanical ponies for a fraction of the cost."
2,disappointing purchase,"it was a cute idea but needs some work. it is not soft nor cuddly. but my biggest complaint is that it does not say more than three things although it claims to speak around twenty... my kids pushed the button a couple times and walked away... it is too stiff for them to enjoy posing or hugging like a doll. i have three kids all young and none of them care for it. oh, well."
3,My Little Pony Play N Carry Sky-wishes Pony,This was cute. The price was ok. I wasn't thrilled with it. I believe it is something the little girls today love. I purchased this as a present for a birthday and she seemed to enjoy it. I think I could have got it cheaper or just as cheap at the local Walmart store. Good shipping and fast though this way.
5,3 YEAR OLD LOVES IT!!!!!!!!,I bought this for my 3 year old. She just LOVES horses and has a couple of different my little pony's... I actually wanted to buy her the pinkie horse but chose this one instead. She just adores it!! She plays mommy to her horse and tucks her in.. I also have a 5 year old & when I asked her about buying it for her sister she got excited and wanted one too. My 5 year old likes puppies & I just new that it would just sit there. I think this toy is perfect for the 3 year old pony lover!!
3,"Overpriced, underplayed with","This is THE toy that my kindergarten-age daughter wanted for her birthday this year. It was a good lesson in how commercials work for her. The pony was not as fun as TV made it look. She was very excited to open the package, but this toy was only played with the first day and has sat in her toy box ever since. Definitely not worth the money."
4,My 5 Year Old Enjoys This Toy!,"My daughter got this for her 5th Birthday and was so excited because she'd seen the commercials for it and really wanted it. It wasn't quite as exciting as the commercials made it look, but she does like it. The other day, we bought another pony, Rainbow Dash (the blue one) to go with this and that has made it a lot funner because now she has tea parties with both of them and pretends they are her twins, or that they are brother and sister and she has them play together. So, it has been fun with just one, but was even more fun when we got the second one."
5,Six year old granddaughter loved it!,"My wife and I bought the Pink Pony for our granddaughter for her sixth birthday. She absolutely loved it and never put it down. As we were saying our goodbyes, she hugged her Grandma and said ""Grandma, of all my presents, I like my Pink Pony the best"". I think we definitely made the right choice. She sure thought so."
2,Not recommended...,"I bought this thinking it would be a fun toy for my kids and they were bored after about 5 minutes. All it does is lay on the floor and move it's feet. Also the machanical parts started making really aweful sounds and the legs would get stuck while they were trying to wiggle. I tried to fix it but no matter what we did, it would still screech and get stuck. Total waste."
2,My daughter barely even glanced at it,My daughter and niece were both given this toy. Neither seems to like it for anything. My niece sometimes plays with the backpack as does my daughter but other then that it sits in the closet......ALL THE TIME!!!
2,This pony scares my 4 year old.,"This pony scares my daughter. Although it moves it arms and legs properly when sitting up, it makes terrible screeching sounds and jerking movements when it it laying on it's back. Not at all what I expected (OR what the commercial portrayed). In addition, this pony cost $26.00 at our store... far too much to only be played with twice."
4,Pretty good,"We have a popup camper that had been parked for a couple of years. when we finally open it up we found the mice had moved in. And there was a small leak. So we scraped and mopped and vacuumed but the nice white canvas was covered in mouse stuff and mold/mildew. The Camco cleaner was great on all the mouse stuff but only lightened up the mold stains. Easy to use with a bit of elbow grease, no noticeable smell, and while we wore gloves getting it on the skin wasn't a problem."
5,Illustrator Scripting Automation Techniques Galore!,"This title is a real cookbook for automating Adobe Illustrator. It covers every minute aspect of scripting Illustrator, including its object model, quirks, and special objects. The book includes a bunch of complete working script examples for Mac and Windows (AppleScript and Visual Basic).I've already used 6 of the scripts out of the book to save me hours in my Illustrator work. Don't hesitate to check this book out if you DO ANYTHING in Illustrator regularly."
2,Probably better for AppleScript,"I'm mostly a Mac user, but I have to work on the PC for a long-term project. I'm finding that the book's coverage of Visual Basic is poor. For example, some of the scripts have typos! which is really difficult when you are trying to learn programming. In fact, I've found a number of typos in the text and this doesn't inspire confidence. This seems to be the only book out there that covers VB scripting, but I've had to do a lot of work to complete my education."
5,once there were greenfields,"A truly amazing collection of wonderful music from the pre-rock days! This album has it all: Frank Chacksfields ""Ebb tide"" (1953), Nelson Riddle's Lisbon Antigua (#1 in 1956) and there's even the immortal, enchanting ""April in Portugal"" (#1 in 1955). Not to mention Percy Faith's ""Delicado"" - what a delicious toe-tapper it still is! Makes me go back to the days when really enjoyable music became big hits. OK, I'm pushing 60, so I'm prejudiced. But for a guy my age, this collection is priceless. If you're part of the post-war generation, don't hesitate, buy this CD. You won't regret it, instead, you will play it over and over. Yeah, it's true, they don't make hits like this anymore..."
4,Pleasant memories flood back.,"These two discs contain forty of the best records from an era that was about to be forever spoiled by ""Rock n Roll""."
3,It Ain't All Instrumentals,"The people who be this CD out,should look up the word INTRUMENTAL.If this word means singing. You have a CD set. Without the vocals this two CD set should have been out as a single CD."
3,Hits the highlights,"Kaplan's book hits the high points of history but rarely goes into detail. It's format is comparative, a back-and-forth examination of various cultures. The layout is visually appealing, making it easy to read and study. Chapter review questions have well explained answers.If you're looking for a review book that is more of a memory jogger, this could be the one for you. If you're wanting a complete, in-depth, review, look elsewhere."
4,Helpful,"I just took the SATII: World History test last Saturday. Although I only had time to study the first half of this review book, I still thought I did pretty well..or maybe I was just lucky that the test this year focused on the ancient civilizations more.I found kaplans world history book pretty helpful, though in some parts the book does give some extra facts that you know will not appear on the test. The little quizzes at the end of each chapter is helpful, makes you realize if you actually concentrated on the little details or not.Not 100% great but not bad either. I do recommend this book to those who might take it in the fall this year or spring next year."
3,Thunders Relentlessly,"""Push Again"" rocks voraciously. Long started out with a Michigan band Wig before forming the unfortunately named band Nigger Lover that changed to N.L. Mule & eventually just Mule. ""Signifyin' Honkey"" is the first track that blasts out like a sonic attack with Dan Maister's bass giving this storm a pulse. On ""Fly Trap Lair"" the lads slow down a bit with P.W.'s guitar chiming out and his vocals mixed high in the spotlight. ""Pooh Butt"" is another sonic blitz with P.W.'s vocals roaring, ""You & me together."" ""Jane Dwim"" thrashes soulfully. The set closes with ""Yo' Money"" with the lads' vocals thrown out in scattershot fashion with Mark Boyce's piano fleshing out the mix. Not all tracks are equally strong, as with ""Laughing Eyes"" that is a partially spoken soul ballad about a Native American love story. However, ""Push Me Again"" is a sonic blast that thunders relentlessly. Enjoy!"
2,I Miss Ichiban!,"I have only listened to this new CD once, so perhaps it is not even fair for me to be publicly reviewing it. But after a very long, very anxious period of anticipation for this CD, I am very disappointed in the product. I absolutely LOVE everything Trudy did at Ichiban, and when she left there, I was worried that there would be a drop off in quality if she went to another label. Her vocals are definitely as strong as ever on this new one, but the songs are not as intense or energetic, and the back up band is nowhere near what could be found at Ichiban in the good old days. I dearly miss songs like Instant Breakfast, Anybody's Man Tonight, and A Whole lot of Leave Me Alone. I just hope she will bounce back in the future to the performer I know she can be."
1,definitely not a sleeping aid,"it may be good for you in some other ways, but it surely doesn't help you fall asleep or sleep better."
1,Highly over-rated . Full of fluff,"If your MBA professor offers Schonberger as the answer to 21st Century Operations Management, seek a transfer quick. Obsessed with a touchy-feeling ""quality paradigm"", there is not enough meat here to frighten off the most zealous vegetarian. The chapters on ""managing projects"" and ""facilities management"" are especially shallow."
5,i love it!,"Not only do I love the organization but the kids love their own ""space."" Very well constructed and easily portable."
1,"I would return it, but that seems like more trouble than it's worth.","This is one of the purchases I have regretted most in recent history.This backseat organizer is largely worthless.The concept is great in theory. And if the construction of the product were a little heartier then it may have worked out. I'm not sure if the manufacturer made this organizer collapsible in order to save on packaging and shipping or if they were just lazy, but it is a piece of junk. The interior organizing panels do not lock into place and the velcro used to hold the panels in place is equally worthless.This should have been constructed out of a hard sided or much firmer material. The interior organizers should have been fixed into place or should have used slots to ""lock"" them in, not velcro.I would NOT advise buying this product. It is a waste of money. You would do just as well buying a $5 rubbermaid container and throwing it onto the backseat. It would organize things just about as nicely."
4,Excellent textbook,"Despite its title, this book contains few applications to chemistry. What distinguishes it from most QM texts is the absence of physics-specific applications like solid state, and the careful, step-by-step process by which the author derives results. I'd recommend it to anyone (chemist, physicist, whatever) who wants to know nonrelativistic quantum theory. It's also a handy reference for a few subjects that have wide use outside QM, like group velocity and spherical harmonics. The style is a bit dry, and I doubt that I'll ever read it cover to cover, but as a textbook it's hard to beat."
4,"Relaxing, good graphics and educational","As an adult, I found the video slow and rather tedious -- however the kids loved it, and would actually sit still and lap it up. The music is soothing and pleasant (of course) and the content colorful and educational. I found some of the settings cluttered and I would have thought confusing for the children -- but I was wrong, they loved it. I would definitely recommend this and my son has expressed interest in the Spanish version now that he is older. It seems good (and strange) that he can learn the same information in a second language using exactly the same material that he originally learnt from!"
4,A bit slow - but it really gets through,"We recieved the video as a gift and after the first viewing I thought it moved much too slowly, but my daughter loves it. She was counting to ten in Spanish at 21 mos and we're an English speaking household!"
5,THIS SERIES IS TRULY THE BEST I HAVE SEEN YET!,"MY GRANDCHILDREN, AGES 6 MOS TO 6 YRS LOVE THESE VIDEOS. I STARTED WITH BABY SMART, THEN BOUGHT THE CELEBRATION OF COLOR, AND THEN MICACLE OF MOZART. THEY HAVE KEPT ALL OF THE CHILDREN INTERESTED AT ALL TIMES. THEY ARE COLORFUL, EXCITING AND FUN TO WATCH. THE SUBJECT MATERIAL IS FASCINATING FOR THE WEE ONES AND EDUCATIONAL FOR THE OLDER CHILDREN. I WOULD DEFINETLY RECOMMEND THIS VIDEO AND PUT IT TOPS ON MY LIST. I ALWAYS LIKE TO GIVE THE SET AS A GIFT FOR A SHOWER OR NEW BABY GIFT."
1,Disappointing and Boring,"I was terribly disappointed in this video. It was so boring that neither our 20 month old twins nor my husband and I could stand to watch all of it even one time. It does not use people, animals, or any real objects. Instead the numbers and shapes are computer generated images that fly through the air or appear like fireworks. For a child who does not yet know what numbers mean the video does not connect numbers to anything in real life. We also bought Bilingual Baby -- Spanish, which our children adore and which we can stand to watch and hear over and over."
4,Excellent Fighting Game,"This is truly one of the best fighting games NEO GEO has released. It has great graphics and sound, but it can be a little bit more hardcore. Has original characters from many fighting series such as Street Fighter, Samurai Showdown, Fatal Fury, King of Fighters, Last Blade, and Darkstalkers. Many features included, such as Olympic, where you can break records and get hidden moves. The only thing is missing is my favorite Samurai Showdown character... GENKUDO."
4,This is one of the best purchases I ever made!,"This is by far what I have been waiting for. I was always careful with buying fighters on handhelds. I played killer instinct on gameboy and that was far from the game I loved. Since then I never purchased any fighters on anything less that 32 bits. Until I played my friends neo geo pocket. Right when the opening animation started I was hooked, and a week later I bought my own and my own Match of the Millenium. Its surprisingly novel even if you have any other Street Fighter alpha-like games. The mini games are fun and earning all those secret charaters never gets boring. I never like writing these reviews but I just have to talk about how fantastic this game is. This is definately a must-have for anyone with a neo geo pocket. get it now!"
1,Save your money for a rainy day.,"The muddy sound is painfully frustrating, especially if you know the pieces at all. Not listenable."
4,Bobby goes TOTO,"Bobby Kimball has finally made the record we were waiting for, a record reminding us that he was the first and ultimate singer of TOTO. Like the best records of this great band, All I Ever Need has the right balance between rock and funk and between soft and heavy. A great record on which Buzz Feiten shows that he can do what Luke used to do. It's a shame that Bobby's return to TOTO resulted (again) in the boys making a semi-hardrock album which, in my humble opinion, is not their strongest side. It is the subtlety which makes their records great, like this Kimball-disc shows. A must for TOTO-fans."
3,good information but grossly outdated,This was one of our textbooks for our masters/undergrad split level family history class and I found it very interesting but it is SO OUT DATED.. A family could only be a married man and woman and only if they married and only if they bore children. this is just one example. I was very disappointed...
2,"""THE TRUTH"" hurts","I bought this CD because I heard ""The Truth"" on YouTube. If you put this song on repeat this cd is worth it... But the rest of the cd is repetitve sampling. They play the same four bars with an annoying voice sample of some sort for 3 mins or so. It really will get under your skin.... Unless you smoke trees cause then anything sounds good LOL."
5,"Modeling may suck, but Handsome Boy Modeling School RULES!","this is another one of those records that people kept recommending to me. finally, after hearing Deltron 3030, I had to check it out. My conclusions; 1. Dan the Automator is a genius. 2. Handsome Boy Modeling School is the funniest, hippest rap CD ive heard in a long time.The Chris Elliot / Get a Life songs (one of which samples Beethoven's 5th symphony) are definately cool. But they almost come of as gimmic songs. The rest of the album is just as funny, but it can be enjoyed as a legitamate rap album, not just a zany spoof. Like most good rap, Handsome Boy Modeling School's strength is thier sence of humor, but in this case, all other facets are just as strong.Anyway, definately check this one out. Im exstatic that I did. And Ive enjoyed this and the Deltron disc so much, Dr. Octagon is at the top of my list for the next time I go to the record store."
4,Handsome Boy = innovation deluxe!,"Tired of the formulaic, hardcore gangsta nonsense, like the Ruff Rydahs? Bored by the new wave of political commentary shoved down your throat, like Mos Def? Then this album is for you.This is one damn good album. In a time where hiphop seems to be slowly running in circles and doing the same things over and over again, this is a breath of fresh air. More like classic De La than the overrated new Mos Def (thanks to the immortal Prince Paul), the beats are definitely on point, and the lyrics are up to par. Break away from the mainstream, Rap City corporate nonsense and grab a copy of HBMS. Real hip hop lives on, as evidenced by this classic collection."
4,Hop-hop for the rest of us.,"Hop-hop for people who don't usually care for the usual ""gangsta"" garbage. Creative and fun."
3,Holy Calamity!,"This energetic album is a pleasure to listen to. Packed full of beats and a completely unafraid attitude. The album could be a bit more consistent, as it's hard (at times) to swallow the plethora of guest MCs that appear on each of the tracks... making the album feel more like a mix tape than a finished vision. Additionally, the interludes are funny but often I wanted them to end so I could hear more music.However, some albums are worth getting for one track. This is one of them. Once you hear ""The Truth"" you won't be able to put this album away."
2,Limited originality,"2 1/2Heavily cited underground hip-hop covers ground of indie rap efficiently, though hardly goes above and beyond off-kilter personality and generic multi-genre collaboration to provide fulfilling structure."
3,Great album but...,"I originally bought this album about 4 years ago. It's awesome, great and amazing in every way... however it got beat up from continuous play. I just bought the digital download and didn't realize that EVERY single track is the same as the original save one. For whatever reason they slip in some horrible remix of one of my favorite songs on the album. I am pissed."
5,ILL with a capital Q,Prince among Thieves had my vote for one of the best joints of the year and Prince Paul is back with handsome Boy Modeling School. I put it on repeat and seriously lost track of a whole day. BUY THIS and you will not regret it.
4,Finally hip-hop alternative,"Something different for hip-hop lovers. A disc for those interested in music, not merely another dish-up of gold chains and bootie. I give it only four stars, however, for the excessive name dropping and less-than-interesting play with the ""Handsome Boy"" samples."
5,Gift of a faith-filled servant of God.,"This is an enlightening book and a gift to gay and non-gay people of good will. I found ""Freedom, Glorious Freedom"" to be both healing and a celebration of the love of God for all people. McNeill's scholarship, love of God and gift as teacher are as clearly present here as in his previous two books. I found Part 4 (""The Gay Love of God And God's Love Of Gays"") most helpful in its eye-opening understandings of the New Testament. I doubt any reader could follow McNeill's explications in this section without forever seeing the New Testament in a new and more loving light - the love that Jesus not only preached but lived."
2,Bad snaps,"The bowl itself is convenient to have as well as easy to set up and clean later. My only complaint is that the bowl is supposed to snap closed and one of the snaps broke off after 1 or 2 uses. I tried to super glue it back to the side of the bowl, but it wouldn't stay. Still works as a bowl, but I have to carry it."
5,Handy,"A handy item to have on a walk. It is a bit large for a medium to small dog to just get a drink, but it is easy to carry on the leash and the dog is happy."
2,Portable dog bowl,"1st the item came dirty, so I was able to clean it off. No biggie.It's not as strong as it looks & for what reason it must have some smell or odder in it that I can't get rid off. My got hates drinking out of it & will wait until we get home from a 3-4 hr hike. Nor good 4 home @ all."
1,Not fit in Explorer 1999 XLT,"I checked if this product fit in my Explorer 1999 XLT and Amazon's site indicate me YES, then I buyed this article but when I received not fit in my car."
4,Dorman Striker Bushings Kit 38424,I used this Dorman kit for a 1991 Ford Extended cab tailgate and door strikers. The kit contains 2 short bushings and 2 long bushings and worked well for that vehicle in those locations. I would have liked the bushings to have been slightly smaller inside diameter because they did seem a little loose.
2,Not the original versions,"The book is well-organized and the author well-published. The sections promise that you will learn the styles for many well-known songs. Unfortunately, Sokolow's patterns, like in many of his books, are not how the original artist played the song. I didn't enjoy his version as much as I would have enjoyed the original."
3,"Alright, Not Basic Enough","I bought this expecting it to cover more styles than it did. It covers many folk styles well but the main style of this book just isn't for me. I would recommend this to someone who is a fan of folk, acoustic, and/or bluesy guitar."
1,"DKS, puzzler","I have this puzzle rollup and find that every time that I unroll it my puzzle has parts that need reconnecting, and the pieces stick to the felt mat and leave little hairs in between the puzzle, I bought a larger puzzle keeper made of cardboard but with no hair and plenty of extra boards for organizing puzzles as large as 1500, it also comes with sponge sections to help keep puzzle in place, it's not the best but it is better then this felt mat and of course it costs more, but I do alot of puzzles."
2,didnt work well,When i put my puzzle in this mat and rolled it up it was fine. when i Unrolled it not everything was in place and this thing attracts a lot of dust and dirt. It's also not flat on the floor - its fabric and i prefer to work on foam boards that i made myself just for the puzzle with a frame so nothing will shift. This thing is now wasting space in my house i will never use it again.
1,terrible,"It does not even deserve one star. I bought 3 or 4, for my grandchildren, and they are very frustrated trying to use it. I am very disappointed that they are not working. It is the Standard Puzzle Roll-Up 36x30 that does not work. Do not purchase it!!"
4,GR8 GAME< IF YAH LIKE POOL< DON'T HESITATE!,"This is a cool game! The only reason why I put 4 stars is because the controls are a little confusing, but hey, I'm a young gal and I figured it out! Dont hesitate to buy this game if you are a pool game! You can face up to 64 apponents, there are about 8 different kinds of game maches you can play! You can play with 64 different computerized players of different leves or with a friend, no GBC link needed, you just swich of the GBC and play! Also, a big part of the game is hustling, playing for money! When you get good enough, you can play for ownership of the pool hall! Sounds good so far? U've bet! Hope this review helps! p.s. dont hesitate bying this game because there aren't many reviews, it's a good one, trust me!"
5,right for tasks,"Perfect size for holding temporary tasks such as sorting papers on accordion sorters, table top photography for items to sell and so forth. Easily set up and take down for storage. Nothing could be better than to say Works as Advertised.Coffee drips wiped off with damp sponge."
2,Not appropiate for younger readers,"This book is beautifully illustrated variant of Martin Niemöller's classic poem. It does a fine job of that. Middle school, high school and adult readers should have no problems reading the story, getting the message and understanding it. The problem arises in that the book seems to be geared towards younger children, simplifying a horrible situation into a context that they might find easier to understand while giving the message that they should stand up for people. This is done in a some what simplistic fashion, using a metaphor that does not necessarily ring true or relatable to young children in terms of connecting it to the suffering of the holocaust. There are books like Keeping the Promise: A Torah's Journey which convey the horrors but in a much more effective, less traumatic way."
4,For the more experienced person,"There are some beautiful cake designs in this book.It contains only twelve cake designs.It does cover tools & equipment,recipes and step by step pictures.Some examples of what it has is:teddy bear cake,peacock cake,rose petal cake,and little girls dancing."
4,clear cutters,"This book is suitable for and useful to both beginners and the experienced cake decorator. If you have not used cutters before or would like some new ideas,this should prove helpful. It used European style fondant / sugarpaste medium. the tools used are basic though some cakes require the purchase of some 'patchwork cutters,' if you don't already have any. The illustrations and instructions are clear and easy to follow. Cookie cutters which are readily available in the United States could be used for some of the designs. It is full of useful ideas for it's modest price."
4,"I think its quite good, actually,","This CD is really very good. I was hoping for a singer-songwriter kind of thing, but I really didn't get that. But I do have to say, I'm really quite ""turned on"" by the kind of songs on this CD! It reminds me of the way it must have felt in the sixties when people were hearing music on albums that was ""brand new""."
3,Cute!,"This case is adorable!! It does a good job of protecting the screen and adds a little touch of color to it. However, It is hard plastic, and all hard plastic cases scratch pretty easily. Also, the back and front kind of snap together, but can come apart if you bang it against something on accident. It usually does a good job of staying together though. So, it loses two points for that and the fact that it scratches easily because it's made of plastic... but is so adorable, and the stand is handy."
4,Sansa e200 series Polycase,I am very please with the product received. The product was received in excellent condition and I was satisfied with the shipping.
2,"Decent, but different singer.","(I'd actually give this 2.5 stars, and the Blessing of Curses 3.5 stars, FWIW)I was excited to get this album because I was a fan of the first album. It wasn't the best techno/industrial/whatever album, but it was good enough, and I actually really liked the vocals.From the very first track, I could tell that they had a new singer. I'm mostly writing this review as a warning.. if you can listen to this CD on its own without expectations, you'll probably enjoy it as much as the first, but if you are expecting to hear the same vocalist, you'll end up being disappointed.(and if anyone knows if the old singer is in a new band, I'd love to know...)"
5,an excellent read-- can't wait to read 'Across the Wall',"Once again, Garth Nix has been able to conjure up a marvelous novel. Like it's sequels, Sabriel and Lirael, Abhorsen keeps its reader hooked and always wanting more. The plot developes quickly and there is never a dull moment as you read. It is, indeed, difficult to put the book down. The series itself is quite addicting-- after reading the prolouge of Sabriel, I immediately logged on to Amazon.com and ordered its sequels.Although its ending had been abrupt, I didn't mind too much when I discovered that its sequel, Across the Wall: Tales of the Old Kingdom and Beyond, would be released July 2005. I only wish it weren't so far away, but I'm sure it will be worth the wait!Overall, it is INDEED a captivating novel~ Although I'm not much of a book-buyer, the Old Kingdom Trilogy has been proven to be worth the price. :] in other words, I LOVE IT. GO READ IT."
4,Only three ... ?,"On the whole, I really enjoyed the Abhorsen Trilogy, but I don't feel like it was written to fit into three books. There are still too many loose ends to make the books a coherent set that begins and ends. At the end of this third book, I turned the last page and wondered why there weren't more volumes. For example, there was absolutely no reason for Mogget to slip and almost say that Chlorr was a former Abhorsen ... but only if the trilogy really is a trilogy, with no more volumes. It didn't do anything for the plot: we never saw Chlorr again, and we already knew that Mogget likes dropping hints of his fundamental superiority and his impressive wealth of knowledge. Why include that bit of information if isn't designed to go anywhere?Again, on the whole, I loved the books--I read the last two in a day and a half, not really wanting them to end. That said, I keep hoping that more books will be added to this finely constructed series."
4,Abhorsen review,"I have read all three of the books in the triology and I can honestly say that ""Abhorsen"" is an awesome book and everyone should read it but not before reading the first two."
5,An Amazing Read!,"If you haven't read these books, start right now. Sabriel, Lirael and Abhorsen are three of the most amazing books I have ever read. They are set in a world so much like our own, but yet so different and will have you entranced all the way through.I hope that maybe Garth Nix will start a new trilogy that is set in the same world as these three, so I can read more of the Abhorsen stories, or perhaps, stories from the Clayr or royal family."
5,The wonderful world of an abhorsen,"this was a really great book.it has a great level of suspense as garth nix mixes magic and fantasy into a really wonderful book. This book is about a young girl, a prince, and two animals,-the dog loyal the cat not- on a journey to save the world on both sides of the wall. Lireal of clayr and abhorson heritedge must use both sides of that heritedge to achieve their goal. All lireal ever wanted was the sight and a companion. Now she has both. But the sight she has does not SEE the future, but holds the mysterious secrets of the past. And now as they pass into unknown battle, they must use their wit, daring, gifts, and sheer hope to beat the unbeatable, only boundable, orannis. Number 9! oh. did i mention the slight draw back of having to find, and rescue prince sameth's ancelstierran friend nick from the evil power of orranis?"
4,could have been better....,"It was a good book, and I did enjoy reading it but there were some things I couldnt help but notice.First, It wasn't as good as the first two, with less suspense. I found myself flipping ahead to the end to find out what happened,because I thought the part I was reading was boring.Also, I think Nix could have ended the series in this book perhaps, insted of dragging it on for another book.Those are my only complaints with it though, and I was pretty happy with most of the book."
2,"Okay, but hardly up to the level of Sabriel or Lirael","I kinda liked some of the writing, but I really felt that there was just a tiny bit of plot for a long book. As a friend and fellow Garth Nix lover said, ""I feel like all of Abhorsen could have been put into two chapters at the end of Lirael."" I would have to agree with that. I mean, the characters got worse, if anything, the ending was boring and predictable, and the villian seemed nonexistant, so unreal was he. The only good thing about this book was how it delved deeper into Death. That was interesting, and made the difference between one star and two. Trust me on this: don't waste your money on this book. It's really not worth it"
2,Pretty Unoriginal,"I don't know why so many people think this is such an amazing book. First off, to me it was very bleak and though it had a plot, it was a bit pathetic, and Garth Nix [used] many things from Tolkien, biggest being that the ""companion's"" name is Sam. They could have come up with better names (Death, Life, Disreputable Dog, Magic, Hedge) The bells/ pipes were hard to follow, and it was a slow book. It was still okay if you like fantasy, but the Necromancers were very stupid. I just didn't feel anything as I read this book. It was a dissapointment, becuase when I picked it up I expecting something exciting and mysterious, but all i got was a big flop."
5,Amazing read,"I just got this book today and I have finished reading it already. There is non-stop action from start to finish so although it is much shorter then Lirael it there are no slow spots. It ties up all of the story lines from the last two books,and hints at new ones. Although this is suppost to be the last in the triogy I hope there will be many more"
5,Culmination Of Genius,"Of course this book is, for lack of a better word, amazing. The final book of the (some call it a trilogy but I beg to differ)series by Garth Nix chronically the valiant deeds of Abhorsens against the dead in the Old Kingdom. A wonderful finish to a blazingly creative three book series. Sabriel is still my favourite but both Lirael and now Abhorsen rank high on my scale. Obviously not meant to be read before the afore mentioned titles, Abhorsen was definitely worth the wait."
5,ABHORSEN ROCKS!,"The Abhorsen Trilogy is awesome! It's the best series I've ever read, and probably ever will."
5,Awesome Novel!!! ~ needs a sequel,"Abhorsen was one of the best books that I have ever read. It was full of mystery, intrigue, adventure,and strong emotions. ...The plot revolves around Lirael and her nephew Prince Sammeth. They, along with mogget and the Disreputable dog, are on a quest to stop the destroyer before he completely anhilates the world. In the end, it seems that the only way to stop this is with the Seven, and at the price of Lirael's life. Abhorsen is a wonderfully fantastic book (full of dark magic) that is hard to put down. I reccomend reading Sabriel and Lirael first."
2,Not half as compelling as Sabriel,"To be honest, I was real disappointed with this book. I know it took a lot of work and all, but Sabriel's originality and mature theme is unmatched. It didn't have me hooked like Sabriel did. A lot of people have said that Nix has dumbed down the writing... and in all honestly I agree. Sabriel is a fantastic book though, and so is Shade's children. This book had a lot of potential, and although it had its unique qualities it didn't really move me. Check it out anyway and see for yourself."
5,Awesome for all ages!,"This book is mythologically rich (if you know where to look) and riveting...it's still one of my all time favorites and will be no matter how I old I am.For a story that has deep characters, heart-felt struggles, an element of [fear] and uplifting lessons for any child or adult dark at heart...this is the book!"
5,Our Maine Songs,This is a wonderful CD. My family and I used to sing along with the radio each year on our summer trip to Maine. We would sing mostly oldies and folk. Since finding Schooner Fare we have new favorites to add to the list and are teaching them to the next generation too. You can't get much better than Scuttlebutt for fun. Schooner Fare makes folk fun and educational too. We always feel good listening to them and you can almost feel the ocean spray on your face as they sing their way into your heart. Their songs evoke photos in the mind which makes the Summer vacation last much longer than anticipated. We love this and all of their albums.
3,Incorrect artist,"The track listing says the song ""White Lies, Blue Eyes"" was performed by ""Flax"", which is incorrect, the group that did it was ""Bullet""."
2,This one could give mediocrity a bad name,"Volume 7 of the ""Have a Nice Day"" series is one of the worst in the set. There is some good music here, particularly Melanie's ""Brand New Key"", Climax's ""Precious and Few"" (very hard to find!) and Jonathan Edwards' ""Sunshine."" However, there are far too many weak sisters (5) for a twelve track CD.It's still a bargain, considering how hard it is to find a few of the songs included, but you'll be buying it for just that, a few select tracks, not the entire disc. Rhino did a great job of mastering, as usual. They should have done as good a job of picking the songs included."
3,Pick your gems from the mud,"The songs by English Congregation and Bullet alone make this album worth having. As to the rest, there are a few nice tunes indeed, but I really don't quite see the point in filling up the remaining space on this CD with boring pieces by some obscure names such as J Edwards or Climax. The seventies were full of way more interesting music than that."
3,Dated and hard to recommend,"Back in 1995 this was a fantastic introduction to Groupware in the broader sense. Today, much of the information is out of date and/or superseded."
1,"Piece of junk, zero stars","I paid more for this than the other cheap junk, but this was just expensive junk. Seams pulled apart after a month, and nothing more than a map book and a couple of hats in it. Don't waste your money."
4,storage,"This is a tough review to write. For what it does, it is very good: it is a sturdy storage pouch that hangs from your seatback. I bought it for my daughter who was jealous of the built in storage area her sister had in front of her seat. Unfortunately, as soon as you start putting stuff into this, it swings away from the seatback and annoys the person sitting in the back seat. I tried tying the bottom around the seat, but it didn't really work. I you have massive leg room or no one really sits back there, this is an excellent product with lots of storage areas of various sizes for maps, booklets, little trinkets, etc."
4,Good Allocation of Pockets,This is really helping to keep my car neat and uncluttered. The only problem is that you have to tie the bottom of the organizer to something. And my car only has one place to tie it to - the runner that the seat is on. It's not a great solution. I wish some velcro was included.
2,not so great,"This organizer can hold books, small baby wipes container, etc. for kids. The one major drawback is that it doesn't stay flat on the seat (it sticks out kind of far and flaps). We had to use a bungee cord to attach it to the bottom portion of the seat in our van. It works okay if you do this. I would not recommend it though as the picture shows it flat against the seat and it is a little misleading."
4,back seat car organized,"These work great for my two grandsons, they keep their books and audio equipment in reach it makes for a much more pleasant driving excursion."
4,Decent travel bowl,Nice travel bowl. I like this type that is coated in rubber instead of the nylon type. It does a better job keeping the water from soaking through.
3,Hydro bowl review,The bowl is very practical - being able to squash it into a small space when not in use is nice. Only problem I had was that half the snap came off the first time I used the bowl...so will see about getting another snap to put on.
1,Moen T4560CP,Was very disappointed when the item arrived and found out that it was not the same as the original Moen faucet that had been installed by the builder and it was also identified by the Moen company as not being the same item.
4,Good for a simple workout product.,"My major impression of this product is that it can accomplish your fitness goals but it can be inconvenient as is. Changing the bands, handles and door anchor from one exercise to the next can be frustrating and time consuming. I helped that situation by ordering two more door anchors and another set of handles directly from Bodylastics so I'm not having to change the setup so often.The manual that comes with the set explains how to do the exercises but doesn't do much to explain the goal. Also, there is no help at all when it comes to choosing how much resistance to us for a given exercise."
2,Not strong or durable over time. For very light training only.,"I ordered a full package of Bodylastics bands. More than two-thirds snapped or broke over the following three years. Like similarly-constructed elastic materials, they do become weak and brittle over time. I would recommend these for very light exercise only."
5,good exercise equipment.,love this system when i can't leave home and go to gym. this helps me with my work out when im home.
4,Great Product,"I would like to give this 4 1/2 stars, but I can't do that. This is a great product. The design seems very durable, and they are well constructed.I bought these for my mother a few months ago. She wanted strength training, but was intimidated by weights. She's been using them at home and loves them.I bought a set to take on the road when I travel for work. They have been a great way to get in a workout when I'm on the road.The website is great too. You get a free year of access.The only downside is a slight learning curve. It takes a few tries to really get the action correct so you get the workout you want. Otherwise, this has been a great buy."
4,Lewis in the land of women,"Another Jerry Lewis helmed effort, ""The Ladies Man"" is a sparkling comedy that demonstrates Lewis' strengths & weaknesses as a filmmaker.Strengths: Nobody does broad bits of comedy business quite like Lewis.That enormous three-story set with the fourth wall shaved away so all the action can be followed is an impressive set indeed.Weaknesses: Lewis' cloying tendency to undermine his humor with moments of self-serving pathos.Lewis' need to isolate certain gags and punctuate them, lest we miss the point (which seems to be his particular style).As a love-spurned fellow who ""vows never to fall in love again""--and winds up at an all-girls boarding house!--Lewis gives himself all kinds of opportunities to mug, scream & tear about the large set. As with other Lewis comedies, the comedy is hit-&-miss, but it has its moments."
4,"Just WHO is the ""weaker sex""?","Jerry Lewis runs amuck as a household gopher in a home for aspiring (and gorgeous) young actresses. A dream job for any guy, unless the guy is still recovering from a traumatic relationship that has him terrified of ANYTHING female. Some of the routines (and the cast) are way too familiar, but Lewis keeps the cat-beat hopping with new twists on some of his most classic routines."
2,Highly original comedy could have been better.,"I enjoyed the picture upon its' release and on home video, however, this Lewis effort, like so many Lewis efforts, has much protracted and pointless mugging which detracts from some brilliantly executed scenes. Perhaps the usual criticism applies: the one-man-band Director/Writer/Actor Jerry was presumeably not able to concentrate on a tight production - indeed, the great opportunity to fully utilise the talents of Opera star Helen Traubel was lost (although Harry James, Buddy Lester, and George Raft have nice cameos). But despite all that, film students can still marvel at an amazing talent with impeccable timing."
1,You gotta be kidding . . .,"How could anyone consider this funny? I enjoy (mildly) some Jerry Lewis movies. The Nutty Professor and The Big Mouth, to name a couple, get some chuckles and a few laughs out of me. But this thing--The Ladies Man--is horrible. Fancy sets and carefully staged pratfalls aren't what make a comedy funny."
5,bertiam,"This is one of my favorite Jerry Lewis movies. The set is incredible. Jerry always chooses great actors/comedians to work along with him--from the wonderful housekeeper to Mrs. Wellenmellon. The scene where Jerry ruins the suitor's hat is one of the funniest ever, and I never get tired of watching Jerry dance with George Raft."
4,ovur_over,"This is Jerry's best work...watch his banter with the maid..half a wellon,not enough to bolt me...i was once in botany..his exchange with the mobster(hat scene)is a movie classic..that's my eyebrow..my hat!!!! This is art.."
5,So Funny!,"Jerry Lewis plays Herbert Heebert, and he does it perfectly. A recent college graduate coming from a jilted romance looks for work and ends up working in a girl boarding house of Miss Wellonmellon, the opera star. There are many funny scenes- especially hat and the butterfly/botany scene. Will Herbert shake his fear and be able to face women again? See for yourself, and be ready to laugh loud!"
4,What can i say....its jerry lewis....,"Here is another Jerry Lewis production that i have'nt seen fora while, and it was another pleasant surprise....maybe not asgood as some but very viewable....hey what can i say...its Jerry!Jerry Lewis, is a top performer that worked hard to make peoplelaugh. He was one of my heroes when i was young cause he put asmile on everybody 's face... from the drive-ins and theatresthat i attended in the 60's....I cant understand the portion of the population that really hates Jerry and dont think he's funny and cant act.....But we all know, that most of us loves him, and we thank himfor his tremendous efforts through his life to make the kidsin us retain our youth and laugh........."
4,THIS GAME IS SOOOOOOOOOO ADDICTING ALSO XTREMELY FUN,"This game is frickin' awesome. This is the kind of game that makes you proud to own a NGPC. If anybody reads this add this to your cart this second because after you play it for 1/2 an hour, you will take it with you everywhere. You won't want to go to sleep because you will want to keep playing this game. get it....NOW!"
1,Guaranteed disappointment.,This was one of the worst purchase decisions I have ever made. The item is poorly constructed of inferior material. Dull on arrival and bi-level blade defies sharpening. Priced way too high for something that isn't worth the package it was shipped in. Do not bother - shop for an ulu or mezzaluna if you want quality.
2,What Were They Thinking???,"To echo the previous review - plastic and metal? What were they thinking?Other than to assure the continued marketing of a consumable (the clip) and the potential for property damage liability claims, due to the damage to the housed unit when the clip fails and the unit drops to the ground, the engineers must have been out-to-lunch when the final plans were submitted to the manufacturing side of the house.I am impressed with the protection the Rhino Skin has provided when the housing has detached from the clip, sending my PDA skittering across the room or parking lot. (note: the Rhino Skin has not yet been tested under the weight of a passing vehicle, but with the current clip design - it's just a matter of time.)Perhaps reinforcing the locking ring with metal would reduce the wear and eventual failure of the belt clip.Buy two or three of these clips - you will need them."
2,Don't be fooled...,"Okay, it looks nice. The lights are good.BUT...................The sounds are not interesting, and the main light show is n the warp nacells, which are not attatched and will come off.YOU WILL LOSE THEM, AS I HAVE.I was rather disappointed with it."
3,My warp nacells fell off,This is a good toy for a while but eventualy the warp nacells will wear out and fall off. Mine no longer work and i cant get new ones. But the other startrek ships by Art Asylum and Diamond Select Toys are very durable. Like the Enterprise A and E. They are great.
4,Enterprise needs a Refit.,"I have anxiously waited for the model to come out after hearing all the reviews of the quality and detail that went into making this newest Enterprise by Art Asylum. I agree, the detail is incredible and the paint is wonderful as well but it is the BASIC design I do not approve of.If you do like to play with the ship, and I must remind you it IS A TOY and supposed to be played with, then you may be disappointed. One of the Warp Nacelles do not stay attached to the ship and continuously pops off.. or the lights inside that same Nacelle will not light up because it is not making a good connection with the rest of the ship. It seems the design of the engines was altered after production -they show signs of carving at the connection point.The ship does not balance on the display stand- it is front heavy. Fortunately, if you disassemble the display mound and reattach it onto the base itself before mounting the Enterprise to it you can get it to balance."
3,"Great detail, poor sounds, left warp nacelle wont stay on","I have had two of these ships and the detail and paint is done beautifully. But on BOTH ships, the left warp nacelle has a difficult time staying on. I need to return them. Also the sounds althought clear, are kinda boring and one sounds like the ship just stalled! :-) I think they could have picked other sounds that are more interesting and maybe even bridge crew chatter or whatever.The base is nice too, you can basically move the ship around in any direction and it will hold."
2,"Love the Show, but the toy is lagging behind","I bought this toy for my son. First of all, the Warp nacelles will not stay on the ship. Sometimes they light up and sometimes they don't. My son spent 5 minutes playing with the toy and 5 minutes trying to put the nacelles back on, then repeat.I love the star trek toys, but for the money.....No.P.S. to the editor, Its a Warp 5 ship...not Warp 6. Take the time to get it right"

2,glue in container changed,"The first time I ordered this glue, I got glue that came out clear (and then dried clear). It was really nice and let the color of the puzzle shine through. The SECOND time I ordered this glue it was a regular white glue. It looks and smells like Elmer's Glue. All the packaging was EXACTLY the same; exact same label on the jar. My guess is that the glue you get is whatever the company can get a good deal on."
5,A great idea!,Spread this glue on a finished puzzle and you have a lasting memory of a fun time you had with your kids!...My daughter loves puzzel and loves that she can now keep them. Brilliant!
3,Puzzle Glue,"How do you rate glue? Just gave it as a gift for a friend to glue some puzzles together, so I have no idea whether it works or not,"
5,Great puzzle glue!,"I already used this glue for 2 1000-piece puzzles! and I have still a little bit left. The glue works great - it hold pieces of puzzle very good, the puzzle looks shiny and smooth, I leave it to dry, though, over night just in case. I already ordered the second one for my third puzzle. I will definitely recommend this glue."
4,Good puzzle glue,"This puzzle glue worked really well on my 1500-piece puzzle. The bottle claims there is enough glue for about 2 1000-piece puzzles, but I found the need to use the whole thing on my 1500-piece puzzle. The puzzle is pretty sturdy. I put one coat on each side. If you lean it against a wall, it will bend very slightly, but I've had it leaning against a wall for several weeks now and the puzzle remains sturdy when handled. The plastic spreader that was included worked fine, though the glue can be a bit frustrating to spread. Also, about 7 dollars seems a bit steep for this product to me."
1,Too Brittle,"I've assembled many puzzles and used a lot of puzzle glues over the years. This is the first time I've used this product. After it dried overnight and I began to separate the newspaper from the puzzle, the puzzle just came apart in my hands... a first for me. I used nearly the whole bottle, so I know I didn't use too little glue on my puzzle. The problem with this glue is that it dries brittle rather than rubbery and the bonds between pieces seem to snap when the puzzle is flexed at all. It is a clear glue, and most glues I've used are white like an Elmer's Glue, that is more rubbery than brittle. I won't use this glue again... When you think about it, ""glue"" is a funny sounding word, isn't it?"
3,Less glue than expected...,"The online description says the bottle contains 5 oz of glue and is enough to cover up to a 3,000 piece puzzle. The bottle I received is 4 oz and says it covers up to two 1,000 piece puzzles. This was more than a little annoying since I wanted to glue a 3,000 piece puzzle. That being said, I went ahead and glued it anyway (contrary to other previous reviews, it came with a plastic spreader, not cardboard), and I think it did okay covering it. I'm still waiting for the glue to dry, so we'll see if I need to be really angry about the misleading information or not.Application was very easy, seems to dry in a clear film that peeled off easily from where I spilled a drop on my table."
4,"No Brush, Messy","The product worked well as far as gluing the puzzles together that it was applied to. It dried to a clear finish and the puzzle is still together over six months later. The only problem for me was that there was no brush, just this plastic ... swipe-board-thingie that usually ended up swiping the glue to the edge of the puzzle just before it dribbled onto my table. Cleanup was a bit irritating and I used this glue MUCH quicker than the next glue purchased which included a glue brush on its cap. I used it quicker because I wasted so much of it. I won't purchase this again without buying foam brushes. Just FYI. But overall a great glue!"
1,Fraudulent advertising,"We purchased this ""Microlife 3BTO-APC Advanced Automatic Blood Pressure Monitor With IHD-MAM & PC Software and many extras"". When the product arrived, it was only the blood pressure monitor without the IHD-MAM & PC Software or any extras. Obviously I will now begin the return process - but wish companies would be honest in their advertising.Microlife 3BTO-APC Advanced Automatic Blood Pressure Monitor With Irregular Heartbeat Detector"
5,the best documentary on water,"This is the best documentary I have ever seen on the value of water. I highly recommend it to everyone; its message is strong, and it is a very realistic perspective. Excellent!"
5,Well done on a really important aspect of social economics,Documentary was well presented although not linear enough as a text subject. It did make it interesting (entertaining). Shows another aspect of the evil and the social effects of unregulated capitalism. I have more understanding of the international antagonism for the WTO.
5,A Must See Film,"This film shows how corporations are claiming water rights across the globe. Using the IMF and World Bank they are forcing third world countries to privitize their water systems. After this is done, the poor are unable to purchase the water.Water is the next ""blue gold."" A must see film."
5,Same thing happening in Chile right now,"This movie shows the continued abuse of third world nations by the west. The water companies invloved promise cleaner drinking water for all. Unfortunately these companies also have shareholders who want bucks in return for the supply.Profits in the west is all cool for me, but when we're talking about nations where the average annual wage can be 3/4 thousand dollars per/year, and that's the workers, many don't have jobs in the first place, the price of the water is often out of most people's reach.Water rights is the big thing these days. I live in Chile and it's illegal to dig a hole and use any water you find, it all belongs to someone. I understand living in a house,flat in the big city and paying for water but in the middle of the country digging a hole and using the water? Most people who live in the country earn low salaries.I mean it's far from crime of the century.What's next air?Interesting documentry."
5,Flow: For Love of Water by Maude Barlow,Flow for love of H20 is highly recommended - an excellent learning experience for both the general public and students alike!
2,"99% problem, 1% solution","Flow offers a good education around this issue, but the main drawback is that with the repeated onslaught of the bad and depressing realities of the water crises, they offer no more than just a couple of token minutes around reporting alternatives and solutions.I think a documentary like this should include at least 50% dedicated towards discussing alternatives and solutions. Instead, the viewer is left depressed and hopeless around this issue - so why would anyone want to be involved in finding creative solutions? Therefore, I think they're doing a disservice to the issue."
1,Concern for water but not Trees,"Maybe the makers of this film should have considered the trees while packaging this movie. There is more wasted paper on this movie than a regular blockbuster! A four fold out DVD holder inside a sleeve. Sure the artwork is nice and the information on the misuse of plastic water bottles is informative, but please, let's not cut down any more trees to package this movie! ""Did a handful of corporations steal our water?"" the subtitle says. But what I'm wondering is ""did this corporation steal our trees?"""
5,One Hell of a Game,"Although this game may look ""kiddy"" it is actually fun. To be honest the only reason I bought the game was because Hayato was in it and I always play with him on Marvel vs. Capcom 2. But this game revived a sense of pure fun which had died in me since the original MK days. This game is along the Capcom game line including the usual hyper combos and specials. So if you want my advice it is truly one of the funnest fighting games to come out in a long time and you can tell the people at Capcom really used their imaginations making it (need I remind you of Saturns ""Dance with me"" special?). So in short, if you like fighting games, crazy and cool looking moves, and a good time, this game is for you."
2,Hardcore Capcom fans only.,"The game has a fair storyline, the gameplay is decent, but you won't be able to ignore the polished PS1 like graphics. The game is very bland and has no depth in it's menu or character designs. Capcom sure tried to push this product to the Hardcore Capcom fans only, but if you want a great game, maybe you should consider other Dreamcast titles and pay no more than $8 for this."
5,The best I've heard,Just simply the finest Little Anthony and the Imperials compilation I've yet heard. I threw out my previous one when I found this one.
5,Underrated singer and group.,"Little Anthony as far as I know usually isn't at the head of the soul-pop list. I am not sure why- I saw them on TV a few years ago and they were incredibly soulful and disciplined at the same time-Little Anthony still had the voice. ""Tears On My Pillow"" is a classic. Listen to the vocal harmonies at the end of ""Two Kind Of People In The World,""(Oh my Lord!) To these ears, ""I'm On The Outside (Looking In)"" is incredibly soulful, sad and deep in a way that maybe wasn't intentioned. Listen to the great arrangements on these songs and just the songs themselves. Little Anthony was walking the thin line between soul, gospel, and pop, but I think it is his gospel roots that make him a step above most singers. I think he is as good as Jackie Wilson or Jerry Butler but hasn't gotten the credit he deserves."
4,Vol 5 4 stars,"All 12 songs from the CD are from 1971, 8 of the sings were big comercial hits, some more than others and the other 4 were not very big hits at all and just barely might have topped the top 40. The big hits out weight the lesser ones by far and dispit the 4 I like it"
5,Some Things You Just Have To Live With : Musings On Middle Age,I am thoroughly enjoying this product. I highly recommend this author. I also received the product within a very short period of time.
2,not so good- not Barbara's best,the first chapter was a turn off--- not her best writing! first chap was a downer...she could have done better!but that's ok- I will read the rest and see what she comes up with- she is a great writer!
2,Discrete? More like hidden and vague...,"I do not recommend this book. While yes, it provides clearly marked definitions and formulas, when giving examples, the work shown leaves out some key steps that leave the reader grasping into thin air trying to figure out the method to their madness. Some exercise questions are vaguely written, leaving the student to interpret the meaning, which may result in differing answers.If you have a teacher who uses this book, get it. Otherwise, if you are teaching yourself (or just have that bad of a teacher), either pass on buying this book or buy a supplement. Or find a good math tutor, you'll need it."
1,"Incomprehensible, Poorly Explained Material","This was required for a math class I was taking. In general the concepts lacked extensive explanations, feeling more like an overview of major topics. If you do not have an outside source of information such as a TA, professor, or another reference book it will be very difficult for you to learn the subject matter from this book."
3,Misprint,"The book itself was excellent, easy to understand and useful for the course I was taking. However, the copy I recieved had a printing error such that the 5th and 6th chapters were missing large parts of the text."
1,Gerry,This book is the worse math textbook I have ever encountered. There is not enough explanation regarding the theory and the examples are not helpful. The exercises in each chapter can not be referred back to the chapter reading at all. The chapter pages are structured to save paper. Everything is jammed together. I am currently taking the course and between the instructor and the book little knowledge is being passed to the less than ten people in the class. This book should NEVER be used!
2,Too discrete!!!,"It is one thing to learn math. It is another thing to read it from a textbook. Although discrete mathematics is not meant to be all that numerically focused, I do not recommend using this text at all. There are very few examples to accompany the new content and the explanations are not clear. Also, the section review problems are NOTHING like the material presented. Yes, it is imperative to think like a mathematician, but the problems are worded much too differently than what is taught. Do not expect to do well in a course using this text unless you have a helpful instructor!"
1,DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK!!!!!!!,"Discrete math is complex enough for subjects to be explained extensively. That's not at all the case in this book. The explanations are too limited but most importantly, the wide range of expected answers REQUIRES this text to include most of, if not all, the correct answers for its exercises. This should not be a problem in this subject since having the answers would still leave you far from getting shortcuts; you'd still have to know discrete math well to pass a test.This text was created ONLY to generate profits and lacks of any interest in the student's learning. It even looks like the author cashed-in his check and took a nice long vacation since his companion website is empty.This book will only waste your money."
1,Excellent but hard!,"This book is the best among all the Discrete Math Textbooks that I have ever read. First of all, it is hard! Secondly it is interesting. Thirdly, its ideas are well presented! If there are complete solutions provided, then it would be a perfect book on the subject. One star means best in MY definition and five worst. Just for fun!"
3,Nice driving music,"I saw Delano years ago at Kingdom Bound and thought his delivery was exciting, I love the song everything is cool"
5,"Great oil, significantly lowers operating temps","I've been using the Royal Purple 20w50 in my liquid-cooled Suzuki VZ800 Marauder, and the difference was noticeable. I immediately went from having the fan kick in at every single stoplight to having it come on about once every few days. Shifting immediately felt smoother (gearbox shares the engine oil) as well.This stuff is amazing. If you're not sure and you don't want to spring for the case, get what you need in single bottles just to try it out. THEN you'll want to buy the case. :-)"
5,Best oil you can buy,I use this oil in my Harley Sportster and I love it. I have tried many other oils and they don't stand up anywhere near as well as Royal Purple. Sportsters tend to run very hot and break down oil very quickly and is probably the number one reason for blown engines in these bikes. This oil does not break down like the others. I used to have to change my oil every 750-1000 miles but I have over 2000 miles since last oil change and it still doesn't need one. The bike runs so much better and smoother since swithching to this. I can actually touch my oil pan after riding without burning the flesh off my palm- that alone is proof of how well it works. Love it and will never use any other oil in any of my vehicles again. Worth the price
5,Better than Mobil 1 20w50 V-Twin,"HD Sportsters are known for top end noise. Compared to M1, this oil makes the motor run seemingly much smoother, and it sounds quieter. Very impressed."
4,good info but dated,"Drive it Forever is an older book written in the early eighties. It describes strategies for making our cars last longer. Most of the information is helpful, some dated. I did enjoy the parts about gasoline additives and other expensive ""juice"" to put in your engine. He says to save your money on those products.Now that our cars do not rust to the frame as they did in the seventies, it is a timely idea to make them last. Drive it forever will give you many hints about how to get your vehicle well over 100,000 miles and if all hints followed, even 1,000,000."
4,Wonderful Resource,This book is full of strategies and techniques that are porven to work with adolescents through adults with learning disabilities. It is a rich resource of the theorectical underpinnnings and the everyday realities that edcators face with this unique population.
5,Versatile and fun!,"Bought these for my 3-yr-old daughter an she loves them. She uses them around the house all the time, and they are super sturdy. Lots of fun!"
2,Deceptive advertising,"The photos of the phase pistol and the communicator you see above only resemble the actual items; they are most likely photos of the manufacturing prototype. Is the danger of having some dumb cop or an even dumber victim think the phase pistol might possibly be a real weapon worth ruining the thing by sticking a day-glo orange cap on the nozzle? At least show the photo with that stupid thing on the end so you know what you're ordering! And the communicator? Display is bright green, not neon blue, and the plastic isn't nearly as articulated as the photo. Overall not bad, but the pix mislead one into thinking they might be great - which they aren't."
3,NOT SO ENTERPRISING,"These replicas are a general disappointment when compared against the excellently done Enterprise action figures. It's not that these replicas aren't accurate-it's that they just look-well,cheap. There is simply no other way to describe it. The phaser is the better of the two, while the communicator is just a total loss-it looks both cheap AND poorly executed. The electronic light and sound features aren't even worth discussing."
3,Hmm...,"Well, the phase pistol and the communicator are o.k. Why didn't it show the orange tip in the picture online??? Mine does not close fine at the top and why do people say you put the batteries in the power cell on top? The tape of the box was broken (not the shipping one.) Why is there no batteries included if it even has a try me button? I don't think this was worth all the money I payed for this."
4,"Overall cool, but communicator is cheesy.","The Phase Pistol is pretty cool, especially the power cell which lights up when inserted. It has a red tip on it though, which I guess is required? Quality is good, not great though. The communicator has authentic nice chirp and pops open, but is really cheap looking and flimsy. Light on it is OK cool. Hope that helps."
1,Star Trek Series 1 Enterprsise: Phase Pistol & Communicator,"I recently received the long awaited Star Trek items created by the new manufacturer "" Art Asylum "". My feelings are mixed. Art Asylum did a wonderful job on the ship and figures ( although smaller than the Playmate Series ). But the "" Phase Pistol & Communicator "" are a BIG disappointment. The Pistol and Communicator look as though they're not made by the same company. They are both bland colorless shapes. Really boring. Don't make the mistake of thinking the pistol and communicator look anything like the photos they show on the web page. The web page photo shows a pistol & communicator with dynamic color. In reality, they are both dull gray plastic parts with a black pistol grip. And let me not forget the ""PINK"" tip on the pistol. Which is a bad color choice for any weapon. Unless you wanted it to go with your Barbie doll collectionDaniel"
1,hated it,"Disregard the rest of the reviews and read this one only. I saw T-bone perform on ""The Cut"" on MTV and he was tight so I thought his album would be too. But sadly I was wrong and very disappointed. I tried to like this album because of the positive message but it didn't work. If you want a good album I recommend the ""Gospel Gangstaz"" ""I can see clearly now."" Thats an album you can enjoy."
4,STRATEGY,"A game mixed with not only the characters that youve known and grown to love, but this game doesnt just involve brawn but a lot of brains to. Use your mental strength to win and be the best!"
4,Great Game! Great gameplay!,This is one of the best games for the NGPC. This game is addicting once you figure out how to play it (which is not hard at all). Hours and hours of fun can be spent playing this innovative and exciting game!
2,not enough imformation,"This book is quite cheap,but it only give you some pictures of gerbils,and a few words about Gerbil's life. To a newbie or a young reader, this book is easy to read, but it didn't give enough imformation to a owner of gerbil.If u wanna buy a book about gerbils,try another one."
2,Not for professionals,"The algorithms provided in this book have nothing to offer over the standard ones everyone uses in the games industry. If you're just getting started, this book might be fine. If you're a professional, stick with Foley/ van Dam and Graphics Gems."
2,Marginal book w/ terrible source code.,"If you're from the old school of C programming, say pre ANSI C, then this book could be really nice for you. Otherwise, save you're $50. Between that and the cluttered, white-space saving, nature of the code in general, just about all the source code snippets are not worth the brain juice used to make sense out of them. A real pity, since a some interesting topics are covered within."
3,"marklmikl,told u","hey,it is wrong world here,i knew some beds more and more hot,but here it was solong time in hot mind u will have at this book,bye"
2,I've seen better,"I did not like this book. It seemed like the author only wrote a few chapters on Doberman's and the rest was cut and pasted from the 'Dog Book' file. Really lame attempt at writing a book. It went in the garbage last month.If you want a real book on Dobes, get a copy of 'The Doberman Pinscher' by schmidt. It was written in 1934 but I absolutely love the in depth history and pictures it contains. Beautiful, classic and well written.Unlike this, less than memorable rag. sigh"
2,Doberman Pinchers,Very brief and not detailed information on the Dobermans. Not too much information on older dogs ortheir temperment in general.
3,I pray that this is fiction.,"If this isn't fiction, he killed SSGT. Swansons Sniper team with a wave of his hand. You don't give away your own sniper teams location by waving to them! What the heck were you thinking? I about fell out of my chair when I read that. If this is true, then the tears in my eyes are justified."
5,Outstanding Coverage of Special Forces Covert Operations,"Col Nicholson does a fine job of describing the horrors of our no-win war policy in Vietnam. I was an USAF Air Commando U-10 pilot during his first tour (1966) primarily supporting 5th Special Forces, in II Corps. Having worked with many A- Teams and Maj Jerry Dodds Mike Force out of Pleiku, I can attest to what Thom says. We not only fought the VC and NVA, we had a side war going with Gen Vinh Loc, the corrupt commander of II Corps, and the LLDB, his tribute-extracting personal Gestapo. There were time when I wished we could have merged the Air Commandos and Special Forces and formed a new Service. Neither organization was getting on well with the high brass in our respective services. Thom, thanks for telling it like it was."
4,It's Okay.,"Interesting. Well-written. Some of it reads like blarney, though. As a general observation, I have yet to read one of these books where the author writes about the mind-numbing stretches of boredom, chicken-manure, and sanitation nightmares characteristic of the coastal bases. But cowboys & indians is what sells."
4,A great read!,"Overall, this is a great personal recollection of Vietnam experiences and well worth a read. I noticed many inaccuracies as well, but the overall strength of story and first-person narration make up for these deficiencies.This book provides a very interesting commissioned officer's perspective on his time with SOG in Vietnam; even though he seemed to primarily serve in a support role, his experiences and recollections are well worth sharing."
3,A good read but not without flaws.,"As a member of CCN (Jul-Dec '70) I do know some- thing about life as a ""sogger"". Col. Nicholson's account is, for the most part, accurate. However, discrepances exist; e.g. there are no leopards in either South Vietnam or Laos, and an indigenous soldier, whether Nung or ""yard"" was never assigned to carry the team radio. Remembering things 30 years after the fact is very difficult and probably accounts for these errors. Still, a book well worth the time."
2,A Fictional Account of Duty in Vietnam,"The author of this book served in MACVSOG in a support role. His account of having served with the recon troops has many inaccuracies -- and he has acknowledged some exaggeration to those of us who led MACVSOG recon teams. This is an enjoyable work of fiction, but John Plaster and Richard Shultz have written excellent historical accounts of MACVSOG."
2,A good docudrama...,"The book is entertaining, but as an historical work is disappointing. I was a NCO on a recon team during the period referenced in the book, but sorry, I just don't remember this guy. I know from other sources he was there, but there are many factual discrepancies that cast doubt on the rest of his recollections. Anyone who remembers the C-Team being ""south"" of the CCN compound, or Marble Mtn. being to the ""north"" must be related to the director of the John Wayne movie ""The Green Berets"" in which John Wayne watches the sun set in the South China Sea. (For those of you who are geographically challenged, get a map. Col. Nicholson, get a clue.) Nevertheless, the book did evoke some memories, and for that, I'm thankful."
2,Be Forewarned!,"Although Nicholson served in MACSOG during 1970-71, this is not a memoir. The dates, personnel, and locations have been altered and some of the events are fictionalized. Have been researching SOG activities and history for the past twenty years, so I know whereof I speak. If you want accurate, and realistic depictions of recon team activities in SEA, see James Acre's PROJECT OMEGA: EYE OF THE BEAST (Hellgate Press, 1999) or John Plaster's SECRET COMMANDOS (Simon & Schuster, 2004)."
5,Yeah Boots!,Excellent product and extremely pleased with how quickly I received this in the mail. Love it and will order again. This product goes onsmooth and gives you a nice glow with enough coverage without feeling like you have a heavy foundation on. I first tried this in the summerto even out my skin and decided I liked the product so much I continued to use it throughout the year. Good job Boots!
4,"Great light coverage, only 15 SPF","I've been using Boots No7 Soft and Sheer Tinted Moisturizer for over a year. Before that I used a tinted moisturizer from a different manufacturer (one better known for skin cleansers than for cosmetics). That one was a decent moisturizer and had SPF 30 but didn't provide much color. I wish Boots' had SPF 30, but otherwise, I really like the product; along with lipstick, it's all I wear for make-up except for special occasions."
2,Disappointed,Was expecting some good pictures of craft. No color pictures they are all B&W. Cheap paper like what you would get from the doubleday book club where they do a special cheap print for their members.
5,"A great, gripping novel!",The Delta Project was an amazing read! I honestly couldn't put the book down - it is just THAT great! It should be on everyone's must read list. You'll love it! I can't wait to read it again.
1,A TERRIBLE BORE!,"This game is basically a boring, lamer version of DOOM. In the first person, you walk around with a sword and hack at enemies. Blah, blah, blah. I played this game for a whole 15 minutes, turned it off, and knew I would never play it again.Games for the DreamCast need to strive for something better than mediocre. This one isn't even that."
2,DISSAPOINTMENT,"This game was a huge letdown. When I heard about this game's ""brainjacking"" technology, I was ready for a futuristic romp similar to the extremely fun Messiah. What I got was a repetitive hack job with a convoluted plot and seriously screwed up dubbing. YAWN!"
1,Oh Dear God Help!!!!!!!!,"This game is so very, very, very, very, very, very, boring and quite stupid!"
5,A delightful escape to a wonderful place,"I LOVED this book. The author is highly skilled at allowing you to feel you are really there. The sights, sounds, smells of everything she describes are so real. Her sense of humor is refreshing. I could relate to Claire with some of the things she stressed about and could laugh at myself too. I found myself laughing out loud several times. Siri taught me some things about myself and clarified others through her characters.I loved the characters. Right from the start I just felt like they were real. There was intrigue, romance, and a rich tapestry of the culture of France. Her descriptions of the museums and places there made me feel like I had been there without leaving my home. I kept finding excuses to read ""just a little more"". I will read more books by Siri L. Mitchell. (all I can get my hands on that is) I hope that Claire and Adrien return to us again."
5,The Unexpected Third Character,I loved both of Siri's characters. They are both warm and engaging with enough flaws to make them real. What caught me by surprise was the third character -- Paris. It quietly seduced me; causing me to read more and more slowly to make the holiday last longer. A wonderful book with many levels of interest. Have fun!
5,Endearing,"What a wonderful story of self-revelation, discovery, and the desire to change. We travel with the protagonist as she realizes her attitude in areas which need to change and how gracefully she matures into a beautiful woman.Siri Mitchell's first person writing is revolutionary and refreshing. She writes with such maturity and flare. I don't know if I'll ever travel to Paris but for two days I was there living, breathing, and enjoying the beauty of Paris. Thanks to Sheri Mitchell's wonderful descriptions and passion for Paris.I rarely read a book that I want to share. Kissing Adrien is one for your library collection. To be shared and enjoyed over and over again.Enjoy!"
3,Christian hedonism,"I enjoyed the romance of this book, and the glimpse into the Parisian lifestyle. I even thought Adrien was a fun, attractive hero. However, I didn't enjoy the way he tended to force his lifestyle on Claire. I thought it was easy for him to criticize her attempts to be fiscally responsible when he obviously had no money issues, etc. In other words, I felt they were in two very different places in their lives, and he seemed a bit judgmental about her choices. But then, she didn't really do a good job standing up for herself either, so she must have agreed with him at some level. I think this book subscribes to a ""hedonistic"" Christian lifestyle, at the expense of personal responsibility and sensibility. In reality, some balance between the two is probably in order. But I still enjoyed the romance."
2,Too Obvious,"This book was a quick and easy read and at times is delightful. However, I knew by the second chapter how the book was going to end. And, chapter after chapter, the book dragged on and on to what I accurately predicted was the ending."
2,Wish I had realized it was a Christian novel.,"I didn't realize that this was a Christian novel before purchasing it, and I wish I had - I never would've read it. I thought Claire was overwhelmingly naive and closed-minded. I found her sour, bitter, and not very likable, but boy did she go on about how men did double takes when they saw her. Blech. Adrien was very one dimensional. Was there nothing imperfect about him? The whole thing was a mess. Even the mystery wasn't mysterious enough or a big enough part of the story. No thanks. I won't be reading another of Siri's novels. I don't want her religious right views forced down my throat again. Reading should be a pleasure; I don't want to be accosted by backwards (so-called trraditional) views. A twenty-nine year old woman who's never been kissed? Give me a break."
2,Well....where do I start...,"This book is awesome if....it's ok for a boyfriend to recreate the one he loves or if you like pushing a socialist agenda or you think it's ok to ones beliefs or if you think Paris is better than the USA in every way. It's like he's French perection and she is an American mess and has to be fixed. Her beliefs are wrong, her clothes are wrong, etc. Really??? What about some balance. Nope, this is just the authors way of bashing Americans. So much time is spent describing the atmosphere that there really isn't much in the way of story here. Um, yes she does kiss him on the last page. It also seems that this author needs to really look at her beliefs about the USA. She seems very narrow in her perceptions. She should ship this book to France."
3,Great idea for a book but...,"I found myself skipping whole pages of the constant, ridiculous religous arguments. I guess I should have seen this was a Christian book before purchasing it. I found the book could have been so much better had it focused on the long, lost relative and how Claire was seeing herself in her, rather than preach about morality regarding drinking wine. I also found myself skipping over the political stuff as well. It seemed to be another way to have the author project her political views for the sake of causing another needless argument. I would have liked to see how Claire went back to school, dealt with her life in Seattle, all while handling her relationship with Adrien. I found that the whole book took way too long to get to one kiss. I buy books to lose myself in them. I have always had a dream to lose myself in life in Paris. This book did not give me that chance as the romance and thrills were not there."
5,2004 Ford Exployer,"Installation was fast and easy. No drilling requried. Took less the 10 mins to install. Took longer to read the instructions, then to install."
3,This shows how litle details can f***ck up a game,"the game has great graphics, the tipicla batle sistem, i havent played all so i can tell you about the story but the other guy says its pretty good, but what really scrw up the game for me was the movinbg sistem, you see you dont get to move around freely in the game the game tells you that u can move in lets say 2 direccions u choose one and ur guy moves and thats all , for true rpg players like myself , i dont know if am a god one or a bad one but who cares, if you like to explore, do more than the must do missions , you like to know more than its necesary to truely discover everything about a game, then this game isnt for you, but if you are to laizy to move ur own character , have no curiosity at all, this game is for you."
4,Mark J = dopeness,Mark J's solo debut is phat! I love East coast and this is East Coast at it's finest! The gems on this album are the 2 Eye of the Needle songs. The cuts are consistently good. Only problem is production in some songs. Keep up the good work!
2,Poorly Written,"The overly priced book attempts to explain distributed computing. Unfortunately, Liu's grammar is so poor that the book is hard to understand at times. The book was written a while ago and a lot of it is outdated. I would not recommend this book."
5,GREAT,This stuff is the best wouldnt use anything else.The price is great also. i use it mostly for cleaning my Harley Davidson it gets the chrome super clean
3,One of the weaker volumes,"This series isn't one of the better ones cause some of the songs aren't that great but the classic songs are 5 Man Electrical Band's Signs and Absoulutely Right, Lighthouse's One Fine Morning, (long version) John Kongos He's Gonna Step on You Again and Buoy's Timothy.Only recommended if you're a diehard fan."
2,Thanks For The Non-Memories!,"Of the dozen tracks featured here, chances are the typical listener will only recognize four: ""Signs,"" ""Sweet City Woman,"" ""One Fine Morning"" and ""Gimme Dat Ding"" - and the last-named is out of sequence, having come out more than a year before the others. The star of this show is Lighthouse's ""One Fine Morning,"" and Rhino must be praised for offering up the full (LP) version rather than the 45-rpm edit, which was about two minutes shorter. It's a shame, in a way, that this song had lyrics; had it been an instrumental, it would have found a perfect and permanent home - on ""Music From NFL Films"" - it had that quality about it. As for the other eight offerings: If they wanted to pick some obscure stuff, why didn't they go all the way and throw in Dusk's ""Treat Me Like A Good Piece Of Candy?"""
1,Really Bad,One really great song (Sweet City Woman) and one OK song (Oh Me Oh My) and the rest are just brutally awful!!!
5,Great Tunes from '70 and '71,"Rhino Records does an outstanding job of releasing some of the best pop and rock songs from decades past, and the ""Have a Nice Day"" series of CDs contains dozens of cool songs from the 1970s.Volume 6 of ""Have a Nice Day,"" which contains songs from 1970 and 1971, is one of the best of the series. Rhino showcases some Top Ten songs here, including ""Signs"" and ""Sweet City Woman,"" but also includes some great songs that only made the second division of the Top 40 and some that just bubbled under, such as ""Absolutely Right,"" ""Tarkio Road,"" ""One Fine Morning,"" and the awesome Hollies-style rocker ""Go Back."" Rhino doesn't shy away from including the occasional novelty tune in this series, either.The brief liner notes for these discs are good as well, and the series provides listeners with a good cross section of what was being played on Top 40 radio in the time period covered."
2,Couple decent tracks but that's it,"Cheesy 70s pop is an addiction for me so this series from Rhino is a sort of nirvana. However, this is not one of the better discs overall. Really there are only 3 Top 10 hits here (The Pipkins' novelty ""Gimme Dat Ding"", Five Man Electrical Band's ""Signs"" which later was an 80s hit for Tesla, and The Stampeders ""Sweet City Woman"") so the value of this has to come in ""Wow! What a great song, never heard THAT before!"" appeal. Unfortunately that only happens once with Lighthouse's jazz-rock ditty ""One Fine Morning"" which only managed Top 30 status in November of 1971 but deserved a better fate.BOTTOM LINE:You can probably get the highlights here elsewhere. Skip this one..."
1,Bouncing Across the Pond,"Hart's book was exceptionaly weak in content, spending the majority of the time on justification of methodology. Whenever one thought that an opportunity presented itself to deal with GREECE and GENDER, immediately the reader was bounced across the Atlantic to issues of African American radicalism or culture in the United States. This could have been a great book, if it were 120 pages that actaully dealt with Greece and utilized primary sources as opposed to secondary theoretical sources. Conjecture is not history."
5,How it is.,"I have been married to a Swede for 25 Years and have been regularly visiting her friends and family for that time. This book offers a nonjudgemental evaluation of why Swedes are the way they are and, of course, why they are not like us. I read this book just before a business meeting and enjoyed observing the differences in culture during the meeting. I plan to read this on the plane every time I go. It is too easy to mistake their fluent English for cultural similarity."
4,Modern Day Vikings: A Practical Guide to Interacting with the Swedes.,This was a great read. I have visited family in Sweden many times and never really understood some things until I read this book. I realise now that I have made many faux-pas without realizing it!! I would love to see an up-dated version released.
4,Great if you work with Swedes,"I started working for a Swedish company 3 years ago as an American. The culture seemed so similar to ours but it isn't after you get to know it. Reading this book three years ago would have helped me immensely.The authors have a great understanding of not only what Swedes are like, but what parts are so difficult to understand for Americans and do a good job of explaining this."
5,Great insight,"My former wife was born in Sweden and immigrated with her parents to this country when she was 9 years old. Married 8 years, Lena was continually questioning why she viewed the world in certain ways while others couldn't see things the same way. The insights in this book got her thinking about what was special in her Swedish upbringing and why she was taught to look at some subjects differently. Reward systems, her acceptance of certain conflicts and her questioning mind were revealed to her as a result of reading this book. Since then, I have purchased an additional copy to share with a colleague recently hired by a Swedish company and Lena has given her Dad a copy. A must read for both Swedes and Americans who interact with Swedish people."
4,Fun book for Swedes,"I am a Swedish citizen who has lived in the US for almost 20 years. I go home to Sweden regularly and feel that I am still Swedish. This book was most enjoyable to me as I recognized many ""features"" of the Swede. I laughed out loud many times. My husband, who is American, knows Swedish and has also lived in Sweden. He enjoyed the book too and we found ourselves reading parts of chapter out loud to each other. One of my supervisors has Swedish ancestry and I bought the book for him. He has a slightly different take on the book. He likes it but looks at it from a more serious and investigative perspective. I would recommend this book to anyone who is interested in how people in the world look at the world."
5,Disney World Magical Racing Tour,"The programmers on this game REALLY did their homework before producing it! The level of detail is extraordinary, and the game is a fun challenge. Each ""attraction"" that you race through has actual scenes from its ""real life"" counterpart. It's hard to describe how fun it is to see ACTUAL pieces of Disney World attractions go flying by! Many times, I have deliberately lost races, just to explore the track! I would highly recommend this game to anyone who loves Disney Parks! It is a BLAST!"
2,somewhat satisfied customer,Came very fast. A little damaged though. Have problems getting this to play. Sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't.
3,Walt Disney World Quest: Magical Racing Tour,"This game is based on real Walt Disney World rides such as Big Thunder Mountain Railroad and Blizzard Beach. This game is okay but it is for the younger kids or it will be too easy. I win every time I play. This game is somewhat enjoying, but it gets old quickly.Gameplay:4/10: It isn't too fun but it would be for 5-7 year olds if they can play.Graphics:4/10: Mushy and gross. I can't tell what the level is without looking.Sound:5/10: Okay,it's just music that fits that place like on Dinosaur! the music is prehistoric.Control:7/10: Easy, fast carts to speed all through Haunted Mansion. So easy, a 3 year old could control this cart without trying.Overall:20/40: That is a 2.5! Round up and this game's got a 3! This game could get better!"
3,Fun but frustrating,"This game is pretty fun in 2 player versus mode, but as a single player game it's surprisingly difficult and frustrating! In addition to the vehicles being quite difficult to control (backing up and turning around is very hard), there are a number of what seem like programming errors in the game. During a number of races, I got stuck inside walls or behind obstacles, and it becomes impossible to move. The camera also has a nasty habit of clipping through walls and making it impossible to see where you are going. For children (the target audience of this game), I would think that it would be incredibly difficult and frustrating to try and play this. I think it's a good game to own if you are just nuts about Disney (although you won't see your favorite characters here... just the really obscure ones), but for anyone else, I'd recommend looking elsewhere for a more playable racing game."
5,Fab-2-the-max!,"This game is Amazing! I've never seen a better 1! This game has realistic looks of the rides (I know that because I have been there 14 times). There is one glitch I have found. When u r racing in Haunted Masion if you drive along the fence u can get stuck behind it! Any way, It's really cool though. I reccomend it 2 anybody who has been 2 Disney World and who hasn't. This game is good 4 people who like 2 race and have liked other games like:CTRCrash Bandacoot WarppedSpyro:Year of the DragonIf u r thinking about getting this game go 4 it!"
3,"Not the best, a little too difficult.","I liked playing this game, the graphics are great for the time it was made. However, the playable character line-up was not very familiar, only three characters were popular Disney characters, the rest were odd ball but kind of cute it thier own ways. The difficulty was annoying however, it took me several tries to get through the Dinosaur level. After that, it just seemed to bee even harder, so i gave up. This is a good addition to anyones Disney collection if they enjoy video games, but honestly, like alot of video games out there, the developers need to let up on the difficulty and give you the option to make it easier, or not make it difficult at all, especially if its a kids game."
4,"A masterpiece, Underwhelming Special Features","Ahh... what a film. Jerry Lewis blends tragedy and comedy so well. The recurring themes of the man/child, the bitter clown, the wellmeaning buffoon who can't help but wreck chaos. Jerry has a very complex and sad side to him, but he weaves them into such absurd, but completely human individuals. This is still a sweet-natured comedy for adults as well as children. No social satire or cynicism here. The physical humor on display is quite ingenius. Better than Buster Keaton or Chaplin easily.This is only the 2nd Jerry Lewis film I've ever seen (Guess the first) and I'm excited to discover more of this underrated comic auteur's special brand of slapstick. The commentary is a huge letdown, not even worth a listen. He just remembers how cute Donna Butterworth is and how much laughter was had on set. Its cool to see the very brief bloopers and screen tests. But you'd think he had more worthwhile material to slap on this DVD. Oh well. Enjoy."
5,Jerry at his best,"THE FAMILY JEWELS is my favorite Jerry Lewis movie. I know that most Jerryphiles cite THE NUTTY PROFESSOR, THE BELLBOY or THE LADIES MAN as his best work, and well they should because those are great comedies. But THE FAMILY JEWELS makes me laugh louder and more often than those other sterling efforts. It's also a more successful blend of slapstick and sentiment. A picture the entire family can enjoy.Playing multiple characters gives Jerry a perfect showcase for his talents. His hysterical portrayal of ""Captain Eddie,"" an incompetent airline pilot, is worth the price of the disc. Co-star Donna Butterworth is cute and charming without being cloying, unlike so many other child actors.As Jerry himself might say, the movie is filled with lots of crazy, wonderful, nutty stuff. If you're a fan of this legendary funnyman, THE FAMILY JEWELS is a must-have addition to your collection."
3,Laughts Galore,"There's nothing like sitting down and watching an old Jerry Lewis film. This film will keep you laughting and laughting. So for real great fun get some of Jerry Lewis's movie, you'll be glad you did."
3,Disappointed.,"I bought this for my husband for a Christmas gift... and I recieved it and it was a pale yellow color, it looks as if it has been set in the sun to long. Nothing like the picture shows. Very disappointed."
4,Good Weighted Ball,"I found that this ball was a good weight for me to use with toning exercises. It is just enough to provide resistance without stressing my joints. The only thing that I don't like about it is that the plastic outside tends to attract dust, which sticks to it, so I have to be careful where I put it."
2,NOT for MEN,"It's a good quality medicine ball. However, it's specifically designed for smaller hands. It's dense, with a small diameter (wish this dimension was on the website). Product description fails to mention this fact, but the included manual makes it very clear that this ball is for women.Also, no surface texturing. It's likely to slip from sweaty hands."
5,Lovely,"This pendant is a lovely sky blue, and the unique shape has attracted several compliments in just one wearing. It looks great on a silver chain. It's an inexpensive way to dress up an outfit in a fun way."
5,Beautiful,I bought this pendant as a gift to my Mom and till date she just loves it. It looks excatly the same as it appears on screen. Very beautiful.
1,POOR Reprocessed Phony Stereo,"I got as far as the first few tracks and heard obvious reprocessed stereo (they did NOT have stereo doo-wop in early 50's!!). Some sound like compressed MP3s. This may have been expected on budget vinyl LP reissues 30-40 years ago, but not today! This is a terrible shame. The original mono recordings sound 1,000 times better. Phony stereo is PHONY."
3,Three stars may be a bit generous. . .,"Volume 8 of the ""Have a Nice Day"" series is one of the weaker discs in the set. There are some solid offerings here, such as Argent's ""Hold Your Head Up"" and Dr Hook's ""Sylvia's Mother."" The strength of this volume, if you can call it that, is in softer MOR pop cuts like Gallery's ""Nice to be With You"", Gilbert O'Sullivan's ""Alone Again, Naturally"" and the Addrisi Brothers often overlooked ""We've Got to Get It On Again.""If you said ""Who, What?"" to that last title, you know what's wrong here. Volume 8 simply has too many near-misses and complete misses to be considered a major force in this generally very good series. If you can only afford a limited number of volumes, skip this one."
4,vol 8 four stars,"I have been purchasing these in order. there are 12 song, but only 6 that I realy like, 4 I like and 2 that I do not care for.Overall I give it 4 stars. I like the music from the 70's best becasue I lived during that time period and was in my formative years.this CD focuses on music in 1972, so if that is one of your favorite years then this CD could be for you."
5,Child Friendly Divorce,Excellent book; I am a child and family therapist and highly recommend it to anyone dealing with divorce who has children of all ages beginning at birth.
5,MAKING HANDBAGS,This is a Very useful DVD. I followed the step by step instructions and finish my first beautiful handbag. I hope they will have making a simple top or dress with lining DVD soon.
3,a good oil,"i've never had any problems with it running hot, but my clutch seems to be going bad, and i don't ride like a nut either, but can not say whether this oil is a factor"
5,One of the best oils available,I bought the MaxCycle 10-40 to increase the change interval on my CanAm Spyder RT. Anyone who owns one know what a pain it is having to remove the side covers in order to access. The factory has just increased the change interval to 4600 miles with the newly redesigned oil filters. That is based on using their synthetic blend oil. I will feel safe going to 5000 miles with RP's full synthetic due to the superior protection it affords. This is a great improvement over the original 3000 mile requirement.
3,wanting to learn need all the help I canget,"all I want is a book with basic instructions to be self taught, I was given a great scrool saw ( craftsman, I just have to find the saw blades, but with my cancer, I am limited to sit down projects and I love the designs of scrool saw and the possiblities of making my own creations, therefore I need an instruction book and a book of designs...Thank you for your time and I hope you can help me,,,Thanks again Pamelashelton"
1,Came broken out of the box,"returned the item, got a different product. After reading about how its hit or miss quality and the difficulty in changing the battery I decided something else would be a wiser choice."
4,Road Digital Tire Gauge,"Very easy to get into tight spots below brake rotors. It also has an audio read that can be recalled with the push of a button and remains until the next pressure is taken. So far very accurate. Only reason for 4 star rating instead of 5, only time will tell durability."
1,The Roadgear Hi-Tec Digital Tire Gauge isn't,"I thought this new Roadgear talking tire gauge would be a good replacement for the Roadgear all black digital gauge I've carried on all my bikes since 1996 or so,(I bought it from Roadgear at a rally in Oregon). It Isn't. The voice feature is nice and it works but the gauge is both inaccurate and hard to use. When I checked the pressure in a tire it was 45psi on 3 different gauges, this gauge read 43psi. It is always 2psi low. Sealing the tip on my 90 degree valve stems is almost impossible. The head of the tire gauge needs to be angled for the new 90 degree valve stems, more like a car tire gauge. Overall, it 'sorta' works but I expected more.The return process with Amazon is truly amazing. Easy, fast and efficient. I have never before returned anything to Amazon and this experience reinforces my shopping here."
3,It's Alright,"The product works well for the purpose I use it for. I needed a 90 degree angle tire gauge for my motorcycle, and it fits in there well. The entire gauge is plastic, which I wish it had some metal to make it more durable, but consider the price, I suppose. The screen locked out after a couple uses and it wasn't able to read pressure, but I took out the battery and put it back in, and the gauge seems to be working again. The gauge talks- it tells you the pressure out loud; there is no option to change the volume level or mute it. This can be good or annoying, depending on your point of view. I like that the battery is replaceable, which other tire gauges similar to this one do not have that option, so once the battery dies on those, you have to buy a new gauge. At least with this one, you can just change the battery instead of having to buy a new gauge. Overall it works well, but I am still considering getting a different one that is metal for durablity purposes only."
5,WOW,"Can you believe it, a extraordinary game, graphics are the best.If you like challenge, this is your game, this game is challenging and very fun and addictive, if your a baseball fan, this is your game. Its a lot better than triple play2k....It has better graphics, and more challenging....."
1,MLB 2001,"I for some reason, cannot seem to ""Save"" completed games on this MLB 2001 video game! I even purchased another MLB 2001 game, and had the same problem!! The game itself is OK, thought the players seem very ""cartoonish"" but the vibration makes up for it. My nephew also tried to save games, and met with the same result! I would not recommend purchasing this game! The other MLB games I have do not have this problem!"
1,Same garbage from last year. And the year before that.,"This was a horrible, glitch-laden, unrealistic game three years ago when Sony Interactive America made it. Now, here comes 989 Studios with a perfect chance to improve on what could have been a great game. What they put out instead is mediocre at best. Wow. New rosters. Woo-hoo. There are still cheap throw outs on what should be base hits, outs are still called for no reason, and gameplay still, well, sucks. Want a forty dollar coaster with Chipper Jones on it? Pick this up."
4,Good Product,Hard to install Because they are very sticky which is good. I recamend having a second set of hands for installing. Good stong material
5,Space Marines Scouts are for serious 40k players,I was very pleased to recieve the newest meat shiel..I mean scouts for my chapter and warhammer army. I feel the store from which I purchased them was fair in its e.t.a. and shipping. I plan on painting and basing these neophytes soon.
2,Mediocre story,"Story had so much potential, but it's told in a disjointed way.WAY too much sex; there's more scenes of sex than anything else. If I wanted to read about so much sex I'd pick up a Penthouse and read the reader stories.This is my first book by this author and it's likely to be my last."
5,Putting the Philosophy back into Science Fiction,"Barton takes a common theme, alien invasion, and reworks it with the grace of a master. Very much a book for the future of science fiction, the reader is left with the idea that what humanity suffers at the hands of alien invaders in some ways reminds them of their humanity. Top notch stuff."
3,"3.5 stars--good, not his best","If you're already a Barton veteran, definitely check this one out. If not, I recommend When We Were Real. It's a similar story done better than this one. When Heaven Fell is good on the basics, easy to like for someone who gets Barton's overall style, but not easy to love the way some of his other work is. Athol Morrison is a hard character to like, and he is somewhat passive. Obviously Barton intended this, but still it's not ideal. He treats women rather nastily, overall. Barton characters always think with their dicks, but they usually have a shred of decency which I felt Morrison lacked. And yes, I thought the sex in this book was too much. Too much in terms of quantity, that is. Barton is always pervy, which is fine and can serve a purpose, but if you were to excise the sex scenes from WHF the book would lose about 1/3 its length. I started skipping the scenes. But the book is good overall, don't get me wrong. Just not his best work."
5,David Is Sooooooo Hot!,You should buy this cd because their bassist David Williams is soooo cute. At their shows I just want to reach out and yank him off stage and kiss him. he is a major hottie. chad(the drummer) just wishes he was as buff and strong as dave. the CD is really good and you definitely buy it or get your parent's to give it to you for CHRISTMAS. DAVID IS HOT!
4,Good for the price,The wire has an awesome look to it.... The sound quality is good no problems there. The only reason i gave this product 4 stars is because the chrome pieces attached to the outputs of the wires tend to come loose really easily... I have to make sure to tighten them up everytime before i start playing in order for them to not come loose while playing...... All in all i recommend this product
5,Good cable,Fast shipping. Excellent cable. I have a mogami and can't justify the price. This one works as well and sound as good.
4,Cheap and retro looking,"I had the longer surf green cable but bent the plug pretty badly so I bought the shorter red one. There isn't much to say about a red cable, but it seems a bit stronger than other lower end cables like Planet Waves, Hosa, etc.Like the other reviewer mentioned, you have to tighten the cable once in awhile, it's threaded on to cover up the back connector, (for that retro look)."
1,Dry,"I love the Dalai Lama, but this book was so dry I had to stop reading it. Perhaps I know too little about Buddhism. It seemed to me he was discussing fine points of Buddhism which I had a hard time following, and it wasn't compelling enough for me to want to continue on. Pema Chodron does a much better job. Her work is much more down to earth and relatable."
5,Hal Ketchum is REAL,"I have seen Hal Ketchum perform twice at the Back Yard in Austin, TX. Both times I was moved by Hal's songs, and the way he performed them. I especially like Hal because he sings from the heart. The words he write mean something to him. This CD is a good investment for your collection."
5,wonderful surprise,Beautifully presented and well written. Anyone who needs to stop and contemplate life for a few moments/days should read this.
4,The Prophet by Khalil Gibran,"This book arrived in excellent condition, considering that it is a used book. Very happy with this product."
3,Adolf Hitler's lost Science Fiction Novel,"This book could have been a tour de force, but just falls short. THE IRON DREAM has Norman Spinrad creating a science fiction novel written by Adolf Hitler who immigrated to the United States. Protagonist Feric Jagger fights for the rights of genetically pure humans, killing all who are not blond and blue eyed. The flaw in this work is that Spinrad's Hitler-author is a hack science fiction writer. The result, thus, IS a hack novel. As an artifact, it's fascinating. As a straight read, it (by design?) falls short. Let's just say that THE IRON DREAM is convincingly bad! A good buy for those that are into odd reads."
1,How could this garbage get printed???,"It completely sucks from beginning to afterword. Characterisation? None! Story? One battle after another. Writing? Any English Teacher would have to rip it apart. Most of the book is a tiring description of rooms and battlefields. And to top it all, the author excuses all of the above in the afterword, saying that he wrote it as another man, a Hitler who never lived. The idea is great, but the book is full of idiots, these people follow their leader blindly, no one is revealed to be more than meets the eye, no one struggles with oneself. It seems Spinrad discounted everything he learned about writing, which makes this a satire about the art of writing itself. It's an insult to any intelligent person. My guess is, this is just what Spinrad had in mind, he hoped to create a satire. And failed. We in Germany can only shake our heads at how the Americans handle Hitler. They have NO IDEA how hard it is to live with our history. Read a history book instead."
4,Highly Literate Satire,"Albeit a bit long, and sometimes utterly tiring to drudge through the endless series of battle scenes, ""The Iron Dream"" is a great laugh. Admittedly the text itself can be difficult to read, as dabbling in racism and the exploits of the Nazis can be disturbing at times, but the afterword, dissecting not only the fictional Adolph Hitler who penned the novel, but the real one as well, is worth the price of admission. Spinrad makes evident the amount of work that he put into the construction of the novel in order to show how single-minded the Nazis were as well as how deranged Hitler was. There are few novels that work on so many interesting levels; it comes highly recommended (although skim the battle scenes is they bog you down). Additionally, the afterword works to depict the problems with the worst of science fiction; some may find that insulting. I find it funny."
4,Parody at its finest,"The Iron Dream has to be one of the most difficult books to review. The basic premise (that Adolf Hitler moved to the US and became a pulp sci-fi writer) is patently absurd, yet so weird and savvy, it's truly brilliant. Of course, the meta-book-within-a-book, Lord of the Swastika by Hitler, is wretched (even as a clear tongue-and-cheek parody), but again, that was Spinrad's entire point. And the final chapter of faux-analysis summed everything up in one neat and tidy package that was beyond ingenious. His psychological analysis concerning fascist tendencies within Campbell's heroic journey was spot on. Clearly, it was a dig at the previous generation of sci-fi writers, such as Heinlein, who popularized alpha-male adventure stories with strong authoritarian and militaristic themes. The Iron Dream is the perfect New Wave novel, an experimental flipping of the entire genre on its head."
2,Not what I thought,"The pictures make it look really cute, but it's actually quite old lady-ish. The cup size is actually on the large size too. I haven't been able to wear mine because it's too big."
5,"Intermediate level book, contains tons usuable functions","This book is probably a lot better for somewhat already familiar with Autolisp. The book is written in a ""learn by example"" style. The examples shown are also explained. This is best used as a cookbook for Autolisp to take and edit the code given to suite your needs. Not suited for a reference as much as for the immediate need."
2,AutoLISP Treasure Chest by Bill Kramer,"Disappointment. This is a book hard to understand for beginners and almost useless for profesional AutoLISP programmers. What I was lookig for a some exapmples and descriptions of the basic functions to get access complexity entities and instead, found magazine-like article and programs.The rest of the programs except matrix I found very common and very familiar. DCL almost did not tuched and did not explained. However this book still can be usable and at some point helpfull."
5,DOLYBRAID ROCKS,THES GUYS SIMPLY ROCK. THIS IS A QUALITY ALBUM THAT LIKE THE BAND DOESN'T COMPARE IN TALENT OR QUALITY TO ANY OTHER LOCAL ARTIST. EVERY ONE IS SO IMPRESSIVE ON THE RESPECTIVE INSTRUEMENT.
5,"very easy to install, 10 minutes","works great,looks nice, i would have all my friends purchase this product, its for chevy trucks, buy buy buy buyyyyyyy"
4,not all's well that ends all,"Great collection of tunes...the glaring stunner is the John Michael Montgomery song which is the final song of the cd...slow tempo hard country that simply does not fit. WHY? It ruins the groove that works well up to that point. Program your CD player to skip that song, and the rest is great. I do aslo question the remix of Madonna's ""Music""....much less effective that the original single version."
5,So Much In One CD,"You get dance pop, R&B, soft rock, alternative, and club hits all in Totally Hits 3. The songs speak for themselves. These are all well-known chart-toppers from 1999 and 2000. Waaaaaaay better than Now 5 because this has more variety and more talented artists."
3,This Is An Okay Cd!,"This isn't the Now collection which has more hits and better songs and artists but it was pretty enjoyable. I like the first track by Madonna, because it is cool and retro. I do not like the music video though. The second track is another great track by Pink. At first I thought this was song was from Christina Aguilera, but I knew it had to be some one better. It is a cool mix of pop. This cd features some of my favorite artists like Dido,Christina Aguilera,Barenaked Ladies,and Matchbox Twenty. But the reward for best song goes to Faith Hill's The Way You Love Me. This is a great love song, a country song with a pop remix. It rocks!!! Later!"
4,AWESOME ALBUM,"My favorite songs on this CD were: #6- Toni Braxton, He Wasn't Man Enough #5- Vitamin C, Graduation #4- Christina Aguilera, What a Girl Wants #3- John Michael Montgomery, The Little Girl (Am I the only one who liked this song?!) #2- Dido, Here With Me #1- The Corrs, Breathless"
3,Not very popular,I have not heard about 15 songs(artists) and a pop CD is a CD with popular songs there is only 3 good songs okay so see what you think
5,Excellent CD!,"Totally Hits 3 is terrific. It has tons of great artists with songs that have made it into the Top 40 across the country like Pink, Madonna, Faith Hill, Third Eye Blind, Matchbox Twenty, Vitamin C, The Corrs, Toni Braxton, Debelah Morgan, and more! It even has the latest from Whitney Houston, ""Fine"", and an artist called Joy Enquirez. Her song is ""Tell Me How You Feel"". I had never heard John Michael Montgomery's ""The Little Girl"" before, and I absolutely hated it! This album has a perfect balance of rock, teen-pop, R&B, and country! It is an excellent album for a pop listener who wants VARIETY! I hope you have enjoyed my review!"
4,"I gave it now,but amazed now","If you into there,please get me.if you're not into strange,see you.couldn't care for less that much.or someone tell me into,please help me.I do like Pink's Most Girls,The Corrs's Breathless,Third Eye Blind's Deep Inside Of You,John Michael Montgomery's A Little Girl,and Dido's Here With Me.go get it!"
4,"Finally, A GOOD Totally Hits CD!!","The first one was o.k., the second one was lame, and now, FINALLY, they got it right!! ""Totally Hits 3"" is the best of the bunch! Only 3 songs are bad on this CD: Third Eye Blind's ""Deep Inside Of You"", Vitamin C's lame ""Graduation"" and a REMIX of Madonna's ""Music""(what's wrong with the original??). The other songs are wonderful, including the likes of Dido, Toni Braxton, and Barenaked Ladies. They finally got rid of lame artists on the other 2 such as the awful Sarah McLachlan and the obnoxious LFO and put artists on with true talent. This collection has come a long way...and is better for it. If there is a ""Totally Hits 4"", let's hope it lives up to this one."
1,totally hits...more like totally misses,"I really haven't been that impressed with Totally Hits ever. They tend to put songs on the album that people haven't even heard of and they put songs that are pretty old. For example: Christina Aguilera's ""What A Girl Wants"". Great song, but it came out in January! Put her last single, ""Come on Over Baby"" on it instead! And Vitamin C's ""Graduation"". This song is so depressing. And they put on songs that people haven't even heard of! Examples: John Michael Montgomery's ""The Little Girl"". For one, it's country, and for another thing, it's so sad! And Whitney Houston's ""Fine"", and Joy Enriquez's ""Tell Me How You Feel"". Who is she? I've never heard of her! And I don't know a lot of people who know Dido. But Totally Hits does put some hits on there like Pink's ""Most Girls"". Best song. And Madonna's ""Music"". Barenaked Ladies' ""Pinch Me"". So as you can see, Totally Hits does have SOME hits, but mostly misses. You are MUCH MUCH better with Now 5."
5,Good Book!,"The book is very thorough and friendly. Palka writes very clearly, covers topics in a sensible order, and provides plenty of examples. This has been one of the better math texts I've used in the past several years."
5,"The essential introduction, and worth waiting for","For me this is still the essential C. K. Williams collection, because it shows the evolution of his style from rather ""standard"" versification through the long line he has only lately begun to abandon. The books is worth the price if only for one poem: ""In The Heart of the Beast,"" a furious elegy on the massacres and Kent and Jackson State Universities in May 1970. I don't think Williams wrote anything like it before or after, but it's a staggering piece of political invective."
1,Please don't waste your money,"I purchased this system in January 2008. About 3 months ago (September 2008), it started to sporadically refuse to play discs. ""No Disc"" would appear on the screen. Now, no matter what discs I try to play, it always states ""No Disc"". I was happy with the system until this point. Now, after reading many reviews from folks with the same issue, I am not even going to bother returning it to be fixed. Doesn't seem worth it.So, I'm now looking for a new system and it definitely will NOT be a Phillips."
1,Don't waste your $$,"I have bought this system and for the first couple of months it was GREAT!The sound although not the best was very good for the $$.BUT Now I am having problems with DVD player. It seems to have issues finding DVD root menue and chapters. The disk is just spinning with a very loud ""seaking"" sound and goes nowhere!!!"
4,Powerful,I bought this item for a small cabin in the mountains where we spend a few weeks each year.The DVD player works fine played through an LCD projector but I never turn up the volume above 10%.
4,"Awesome price, awesome sound","Bought this system over a year ago and the sound is still awesome, especially considering I got it refurbed, under 170 bucks and the sound it generates is awesome. Yep, its only 2.1 surround sound but you won't get anything that touches this quality for the price it sells for. Too easy to set up, plug in 2 speakers and 1 subwoofer...how hard can it be. If you want to get more advanced you can, the manual tells you all the details on how to do it. The only that does suck about it is that you can't really build on it. The speakers attach using the same kind of plugs used to attach your CPU power cord to your motherboard? if you're like huh, i can simplify...if you want to expand past 2 speakers I suspect philips is going to make it expensive. You can do it yourself if you have the knowhow but the system isn't designed for it so it'd prob be better to just buy a different system."
1,Don't waste your time and money,"I started having problems with this from the first week. The remote stopped working on CDs and would not advance the song. I would have to go up to the machine and advance songs manually. I was willing to live with that but then a DVD wouldn't eject. I read the reviews beforehand and knew this wasn't a top-end or durable machine but I didn't expect a product this bad. Like other reviewers have said, I will never buy a Phillips product again. Not worth it."
1,Faulty,"Had it for almost a year and it worked pretty well. The sub was pretty impressive; however, a dvd got jammed (i don't abuse my stuff) and after I got it out, it doesn't work now. I contacted Philips about a warranty and they said since I took the dvd out myself that the warranty is void. That is incredibly crappy customer service if you ask me. Thats the last philips thing I'll ever buy."
4,Great for the buck...,"For the buget minded, this is a great unit. Sound comes from behind you as if there were surround speakers. I was impressed. Can't go wrong. BUY!!!"
5,Awesome Home Theater in a box!!,"This is a really awesome Home Theater system, my living room is odd shaped and i just didn't feel like hanging speakers...I seen this and decided to give it a try even thought there are a lot of complaints... And WOW The sound Quality is amazing The two Sonowave speakers give a very nice high and mid range while the sub woofer defiantly lets out a rumble Its so clear.. now I don't hear the whole virtual rear crap but the left to rights makes it seriously sound like its coming that direction... My parents have the Bose 3-2-1 and I love Bose but its out of my price range anyhow after hooking this up i think it sounds better then it.. now maybe not boses higher end stuff but for 900 vs this price ill Take this anyday!(P.S still love bose!!!) :)Cons: Nothing!!! Try it you'll See if you can still find one new!"
1,Do Not Buy,"Bought this when reviews were still strong, before all units began not recognizing DVD's, as you will see with about 90% of these reviews. Called Philips, out of warranty, nothing they could do, period. I pointed out this is a major recurring problem, nothing they could do. DO NOT BUY."
1,Wasn't a bargain,I probably had this system about 6 months when it quit recognizing DVD's as others have reported. Just about the time to lose track of receipts and packing material. I had another DVD player so I just wrote it off to experience. It just occurred to me to return here and post this review for other potential buyers.
2,Disappointed,I loved the sleek look and the simplicity of this unit. I was terribly disappointed when the DVD player stopped working. I'm in search of a better system.
1,Piece of junk,"We purchased this from Walmart in 2008 and it has barely worked since then. The digital sound kept going in and out like something said previous, it doesn't play most legally purchased DVDs, and the remote just stops working to where it will only turn the system on and off. I contact Philips and they said have it repaired at local shop. Our decision is to throw this piece of junk away and never buy anything with Philips name on it again!!!"
2,Lasted only 6 mos.,"This home theater sys broke down on me, like previous reviewer, it just stopped reading DVDs.Not only that... Philips changed their phone number on product registration form, like they're hiding... and i had to search them down to file warantee.On top of it all... i never really liked it... this was a puny, underpowered system with no bass control.I do NOT recomend this system.."
1,What a piece of ...,"After only 3 months of light use, the unit quit reading DVDs. Tried disc and laser cleaners, but nothing worked. Now I have to send it back to Philips for repair. We'll see how that goes.UPDATE:So, Philips fixed it under warranty and sent it back to me. Took about 1 to 2 months to get the unit back. The fix only lasted a couple months. It's broke again -- same problem. This time, it's not under warranty. I think I'll get more pleasure out of the unit by tossing it off a cliff. This unit is junk, pure and simple -- nothing but junk."
4,hauntingly beautiful,"this album is haunting, gorgeous, lush and lovely. give the klapa sinj guys a try. little or no musical accompaniment - just exotic, gorgeous voices creating a unique and mystical sound."
4,Great for lovers of oriental carpets...,"I couldn't resist this book! I love oriental carpets, but of course they're expensive and require a lot of space. This way I can have the designs I love, in miniature. The rugs he chose are lovely, and the designs easy to follow, plus he provides the color numbers for the yarn if you want to use his colors. (This is particularly nice if you live overseas like I do and need to order the yarn.) I would have liked some hints on how to come up with designs for other rugs, but it's easy to figure out by looking at his designs. The book is obviously for a niche market, but if you like oriental carpets and needlepoint, I doubt there's anything out there quite like this."
4,Powerful stories,"I really enjoyed these ghost stories. The first story, ""The Red Cottage"" nearly gave me nightmares. Interestingly, some of the descriptions Wakefield uses for his ghosts show up in another ghost story I'm reading, Affinity and I'm enjoying the synchronicity between these two books. The introduction to the story collection says that Wakfield was a contemporary with Lovecraft and it shows in his stories, in the subtle way he turns the oridinary into the extroridinary and ultimately into the horrific. I find that his shorter stories pack more of an emotional punch than his longer ones. His best stories are the ones that stay under twenty pages. The longer ones lose their pacing. He doesn't throw in enough smaller scares in to compell rapid page turning. Nonetheless, stay with the longer stories and enjoy the endings. They all do satisfy at their conclusions."
1,DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!,"This book is completely worthless. Not only it doesn't work out all the problems, it doesn't even work out all the odd problems. Just a random problem here and there. In many of the problems it doesn't explain how they got the answers or where in the text you can find some help."
1,Will Never Deal with Gateway Media again!!,You won't get what you see. Amazon will not honor the A to Z guarantee. So if you want to throw away your money deal with Gateway Media and Amazon.
5,One Tree Hill sseasons 1 - 6,I ordered these a little late for my daughters christmas present. The vendor was able to get them out in time so she could open them for Xmas. She was very excited about getting all 6 seasons for Xmas. The DVDs were of good quality and she has finished watching all of them.
3,One Tree Hill,"okay well I'm a huge One Tree Hill fan and when the first two seasons came out my dad bought them for me, but I lost one of the disk and also got left behind from owning all the rest of the seasons so I came across this seller Roberto's Bazaar and saw a good deal, so choose to get it. So today my mother called me telling me my ordered had arrived and I came rushing home only to realize that the seasons aren't original there copys and my laptop doesn't even want to read it for the same reasons luckily since I already owned the first two season I was able to figure out they weren't real I mean it works on my dvd, but I wanted the original set not a copy and you can so tell just by looking at the box structure cause it's so silk and the colors are to bright, but whatever I'm happy i have the season just not happy there not original I would give this product a 50/50."
2,Kids didnt like it,My 11 yr. old likes to do yoga. So I bought this for her and she doesnt care for it. She said they go too fast and it's kind of boring. Now it collects dust on the dvd shelf. I would not recomend this dvd.
1,DVD was defective,"The DVD was defective so I returned it and received a replacement. It too, was defective. I would be cautious in ordering this DVD unless you are assured the DVD is not defective. Amazon was great in sending a replacement (no charge for shipping) and eventually sending me a refund."
2,Not what I expected,The video is short and I was expecting to see more poses/asanas for kids. There are much better yoga programs/series for kids. I wouldn't recommend this one.
1,Guy is a washed up hack,I had a course from this guy at Digpen.edu and he forced us to buy this book for his course. I could only stomach the first couple chapters. He made a couple games in the 80's and has nothing relevant to say about the games of today.
5,Definitely Can Read More Than Once,"Although I felt that the confusion in the plot was truly predictable, not much else about the story is. This is about a woman taking charge and accepting her her life as it has been handed to her; essentially playing by her own rules after being subservient for so long. I love all of the books by Elizabeth Rolls, but am especially pleased with this one. The plot is fresh and I have been able to read this one several times without becoming bored."
4,Great book for studying states,"I LOVE incorporating cooking into our lessons! It combines multiple senses to enhance learning and long-term retention. Plus, it's just plain fun! About once a week while my children and I were studying the States of the US, we cooked something regional. I used this cookbook the most. It gives a short background about each state with a focus on its history and food. It then provides an easy recipe related to that state. A few examples include Louisiana Gumbo, Nebraska Cornhusker Burgers, Oregon Cherries and Cream, & South Carolina Grits."
4,Fast-paced adventure,"In this fast paced action novel, the author keeps a lot of balls in the air through much of the story and cleverly manages to pull it all together and bring things to a satisfactory conclusion in the end.Scrivens' book is reminiscent of the John D. McDonald Travis McGee novels with regard to storyline and character building. There's a lot going on in this novel, and the reader is kept on her (or his) toes trying to figure out where things will go.Dead Times Three is a very enjoyable read, with likeable characters and a couple of twists you don't see coming. It's a worthy addition to the action adventure genre."
4,Tis good...,"Not enough fast gospel for me. I play bass so I was looking for more of a cd that I could learn from. But it had alot of synth, and fake drum beats. But still a good album."
3,N64 Controller,"The controller had animal bite marks on the cord, which WAS NOT in the description. But it works well and doesn't bother me. I just look down upon incorrect descriptions. Overall I'm ok with my purchase."
3,Spirit in the Sky Fans,"Not a bad CD, but Norman Greenbaum is definitely the highlight. All you spirit in the sky fans will probably be buying the CD for this alone."
4,Excellent part of a great series!,"This second volume of Rhino's Have A Nice Day 70's series has got to be one of the best I have heard. Rhino really did a great job when compiling these Top 40 gems. I am 38 yrs. old, and was not even born when these songs were popular, but the 70's is my favorite musical decade, and I received the CD for my last birthday.From the infectious bubblegum of 'My Baby Loves Lovin' & 'Lay A Little Lovin' On Me' to the soaring poingancy of 'United We Stand' &'Everything Is Beautiful', this collection gives a great representaion of the Top 40 scene in late 1970. It is truly a must have for anyone who grew up on this stuff, or just loves 70's music."
2,Who Cares?,Not total garbage but mostly one hit wonders that were really light weight AM radio fare when they were first released. Who knows some of these songs will probably end up in a Tarantino movie I suppose and then they will be cool...
2,Flimsy,"I thought this item, being so unusual, would be an asset to my husbands John Wayne memorabilia collection. However, I believe it to be overpriced considering how flimsy it is and it's not even full sized."
3,Nice box but not as pictured,"The lunchbox I received wasn't exactly like the online picture. Online picture shows John Wayne on the top half with a faux-embossed leather look on bottom half. Faux-embossed leather look was what originally caught my eye and I thought it looked really cool. I did not contact the seller because it was a present for my daughter, a huge John Wayne fan, and I knew if I tried returning it to get another, it would not arrive before her birthday. She likes the lunch box just fine but it's not what I ordered for her so it's more my disappointment than hers."
4,Good but not great,I really wanted to try this world famous chili so I ordered it. It was a good meaty chili that reminded me of the chili we used to have at an old restaurant chain called Doggie Diner. It was very tasty but was way more fattening than some other chilis around. It wasn't so special that I would go out and buy it again and take the calorie consequences. When I'm feeling nostalgic - and skinny again - I might go ahead and order another.
1,Fraud Alert!!!,It says in the ad: Price $3.79 ($0.38/ 10 items). Looking at that it seemed to me what I was getting was 10 cans of this but what I got in the mail was one small can of hot dog sauce.
5,A Beginner's Must,"I wanted to learn the guitar on my own. I did not want to pay for lessons, and I wanted to learn at my own pace. Going to a local bookstore, I set out to find a quality yet cheaper priced chord book, one that was understandable and easy to use. Instant Guitar Chords was one that I more or less stumbled upon and after two years of playing at various churches, schools, and weddings, I am one satisfied customer.Instant Guitar Chords comes with a CD to help you along, with tuning and playing chords properly. It has provided me all the chords I've ever needed to play including bar chords. It is easy to flip through and navigate to find the desired chord. Unlike other chord books I saw it is compact in size, so it is not a hassle to keep right in my guitar case.I have taught one guitar student and now am teaching another, all thanks to my learning from Instant Guitar Chords. I am online as we speak to order another Instant Guitar Chords for my current student. Buy it today!"
5,Super Listening,"This CD gets listened to a lot by my wife and me. Good sound, good lyrics, top-notch stuff!Our favorite track is ""Please Don't Let it End"".""The sun will set, the Son will put my mind to rest.The evening comes, done is the day, all in Yourperfect will...""They are no longer together, but a couple of these guys went on to form the Fighting Jacks."
2,"Bizarre, near-schizophrenic rant","Intending to tell the story of ""AOL Community"" in the old days through his own experiences, former AOL Forum Leader George ends up repeating it in this cranky, disconnected, and occasionally psychotic rant. It's true that the earlier years in AOL forums and chat were an interesting time, and there are many good stories that could be told. This book is more of a glimpse into the strange and twisted world of ""remote staff"" and forum volunteers. George slides into pipe-in-mouth storytelling about his own life too much, and even includes recipes. Recommended for the student of abnormal psychology only."
1,AOL?,"I didn't like this book at all. I was expecting to hear about how AOL became what it is today. Instead I read a lot of boring little stories that didn't have anything to do with AOL. George was only the forum leader at AOL. And that is all the info that you will find on AOL. Just about forums and chat rooms. And there isn't a whole lot that kept my interest. If you are looking for learn about AOL and find out how they became what they are today, then this is not the book. And if you don't want it for that, well, I didn't find it all that interesting."
5,Full Range of Motion,"Awesome! Well worth buying. Tim is funny, clever, and his DVD is great for the whole family to watch."
5,so FUNNY!,"We love love love this movie, my husband & I had to pause the DVD several times just to recover from laughing so hard. Everyone we have shared this DVD with loves it too."
3,It's OK,"Personally, for me, it takes a VERY funny comedian to get me really laughing. On this DVD, Tim did make me smile quite a bit, with a few light chuckles and one good LOL. You would probably have more fun with it if you were watching it with a group prone to laughing. I do very much appreciate his ""clean"" material."
4,Good clean fun,Great video! Tim Hawkin's is hilariously funny and one of the best christian comedians I've ever heard.
5,Tim is hilarious!,"Even though I've seen this several times I still find it extremely funny! I also highly recommend his 2nd dvd ""I'm no Rockstar."" I own them both and love 'em! Can't wait for another one to come out!"
5,Tim Hawkins DVD Review,"This is an excellent comedy DVD. It's perfect for a laid-back church gathering, because it's clean comedy."
5,Wacky but fun,"If you don't know what Yatta! is all about, you probably won't know what to make of this CD. Do a search on the web and you'll find out all you need to know (watching the music video is a must).Basically it started as a sketch from a Japanese comedy show that grew way out of proportion thanks to the Internet. A band of Japanese guys called Happa-tai (""leaf team"") dances around in fig-leaf underwear while singing ""Yatta!"" (""We did it! / All right!"") and about how they're so happy. It's hilarious and must be seen to be believed.The CD has only the one song (plus the karaoke version and a remix), but it's such a great song it's worth every penny. It will stick in your head and never leave, until you find youself succumbing to Yatta fever. Yatta!!!(BTW, if you saw Happa-tai on Jimmy Kimmel Live, they sing much better in the CD than they do live.)"
3,Scholarly,"Nick Moloney's efforts in bringing back to us the music of late XIX century NYC vaudeville are to be applauded, but after the delightful opening track that gives its name to the record, it becomes less an alive musical experience and more a museum expedition. I know, a difficult trick to pull off, but their treatment of the ""McNally's Row of Flats"" track shows that it could have been done..."
5,Excellent book,This is the book I was waiting for long on DB2UDB. This not only covers topics for certifications but also good (very good) reference material for all UDB DBAs on LUW platform.
5,CONCISE CATALOG OF OFFICIAL STD. WORLD WAR 2 ORDANCE,"THIS IS A CATALOG OF STANDARD ORDNANCE FROM THE OFFICIAL U.S. WORLD WAR 2 ARSENALIN A NUTSHELL: IT DOESN'T GET AN CLEARER OR SIMPLER THAN THIS & FULLY ILLUSTRATED TOO!If one is at all interested in military hardware, especially from an historical standpoint, this book will be impossible to put down. Basically, most everything, from fuses, to artillery shells and pieces to mines, mortars and grenades are included. Enough useful info is included for each individual ordnance for one to realize how these weapons might best have been used and to what effect. In some cases, the penetrating power of projectiles is also included, and this is especially important with tanks, which of course were also included, complete with detailed diagrams and specs.BOTTOM LINE: EXACTLY WHAT IT IS SUPPOSED TO BE"
2,Sorry to be a wet blanket,"Bought it. Tried it. Returned it.Scanning was very difficult to control and it was too easy to have areas of compression or where the scan is stretched. I would have thought that a well designed device could compensate for variations in scan speed. I may have been able to practice further and get better results, but I probably have less patience than the others extolling this product. On the plus side, the company has at long last delivered on its promise for MacOS X drivers and deserves business for this alone.What I now use in place of the Docupen is a photocopier (in the library) and and the incomparably useful Fujitsu ScanSnap (in my office). The result is high quality PDFs of paper documents and journal articles unavailable in electronic format. The quality far exceeds what the Docupen can deliver."
1,Wait for Other Options. This is too Hit-or-Miss.,"After seeing several fair-to-good reviews on Amazon and a few other sites, I figured my office should try one of these.Not only did the sealed box fail to include the ""calibration"" sheet, but this thing is impossible to use.Pro's:--Compact--Sounds like a great ideaCon's:--Unable to scan smoothly enough NOT to stretch/compress letters--Our sample had an uneven roller--it would ""bob"" up and down like an uneven wheel, distorting all scans--Paperport 8.0's OCR is horrendously inaccurate--Scanner stays on for 3 seconds--even when plugged into the USB port!!?!? Extremely annoying, and unnecessary.--Very, very difficult to scan in an ID card without taping the card to a desk first--otherwise the scanner would push the card around, and you can't stop/slow down in order to reorient your fingers...I wasn't expecting perfection from this product, but I was overwhelmingly disappointed with its performance and quality of construction."
3,"Great idea, poor execution","Ok, I admit I love gadgets, but lack patience (3* only because I love the idea of an inexpensive portable scanner). With that in mind, I received the DocuPen as a gift, but after looking at a how-to video that I assume went with an earlier release of the pen, and trying to scan and upload the pictures several times without success, I called their support number only to be told to leave my number for a return call. Well, no return call yet, and as I examine the cheesy construction and contemplate their lack of clear documentation and amatuerish product suport,a fatal flaw in this day and age, I boxed it up and sent it back."
1,More trouble than it's worth,This is a gadget with more promise than delivery. It was a retirement gift to me and I'm sure glad that not a penny from my pocket went toward the purchase. Difficult to operate and the end product is not worth the trouble. You have been warned!
3,Planon DocuPen Handheld Scanner,"I have to give the Docupen a mixed review. It does what it is supposed to do but is difficult to use. Under ideal circumstances, such as a document on a desk, it performs fairly well. I have more trouble with scanning a magazine page; my success rate to date after using the Docupen 6 - 8 times is probably 50%. I recognize that this will probably improve with practice but I think it will always be a little tricky and unpredictable."
2,Good idea. Battery didn't work. Cust. Service=worse ever,"Battery didn't ever charge properly. So the thing doesn't work unless I have it plugged into a computer. So a waste of time really. Now I have been told by Planon that it's going to take '8-12 weeks' before I can get an exchange from Planon. I think that's pathetic. And judging by the poor, poor customer service, I am expecting to be waiting for far more than 8-12 weeks."
2,Bad quality product,The product is of bad quality. When I try to connect it to my computer it does not operate most of the times at once. The connection circuit is problematic. Is there a way to replace it with an operational one?
5,Product only as good as Seller,"My first Docupen R700 was defective out of the box. Thank goodness I purchased it from DataVision through Amazon. Planon's tech support was at the ready to help me download all new software, etc. to determine why my scans were severely distorted. They concluded that the product was defective and recommended replacement. Planon's RMA department (a disaster) took 1 1/2 weeks to generate a return number and could only promise a 3-4 week turn around for replacement. The retailer, DataVision, came to my rescue with a new pen and it worked splendily on the first try.The pen produces adequate scans to help me view historical documents outside of their storage archives. Copies, while not beautiful, are adequate and permit copies without damage to bindings. The scans cannot equal those of a flatbed, but one can't pack a flatbed in the shirt pocket either."
1,I Wish It Lived Up 2 the Description,Do not have high hopes on the performance of this device. It functions poorly and is unreliable. Too much money for what it doesn't live up too.
3,DocuPen R700 review,"I thought I was getting a color scanner, but it was black & white. That was not made obvious in the write up. It works great, but takes some getting the hang of it. Especially if you have HP printer software, they link up!"
4,very pleased,"After having trouble with multiple digital scales failing for various mysterious reasons (even after replacing the batteries) we decided to find something that did not need batteries or wires to work. I did not want a cheap scale that I would not have confidence in the accuracy of. After reading many reviews we settled on this scale. I am very glad we did. It is accurate, easy to read, and sturdy. We have been very pleased with this scale."
1,NOT FOR USE IN HUMID AREAS (BATHROOM),"I was very disappointed with this scale. It was difficult to get it to a true zero to begin weighing, and then based on the tilt of my head, the weight changed considerably. I placed this in our large bathroom and the humidity destroyed the plastic lens."
4,As Stated on the Video itself:,"As stated on the video sleeve itself:A young farmer meets an alluring young woman on vacation from the city and immediately falls under her spell. She persuades him to murder his wife so that they can be together. After making a half-hearted attempt to kill his wife, he realizes that he truly loves her. But an unexpected and cruel twist of fate threatens to separate the reconciled couple and thoughts of revenge for his treacherous mistress fill the farmer's heart. The ultimate resolution of this bizarre love triangle makes this an engrossing drama that stands apart as a thrilling monument of silent film."
4,Guide to the Quaker Parrot - Review 2011,Excellent book. Very informative and easy to read. Well written and the content is very accurate and interesting. I recommend it to beginners and breeders. Thank you...
4,GBC SHREDMASTER,FOR A LOW PRICE SHREDDER THAT FITS ANY BASKET THIS PRODUCT IS IDEAL. DOWNSIDES OF THE SHREDDER IS THAT IT IS STRAIGHT CUT ONLY AND ONLY TAKES A FEW SHEETS AT A TIME. RUNS QUIETLY.
5,Outstanding!,"This watch will, literally, stop people in their tracks! It's a great size with good weight and excellent complications. It looks like it costs alot more than you will pay for it. If you are looking for an attention grabber, this is the watch for you!"
5,Great for beginning Japanese courses,the dictionary helps you with many words but also shows you how they should be used in a sentence. This dictionary helped me immensely with my Beginning Japanese courses at the local community college. I definitely recommend.
2,Outdated,CFD is a rapidly evolving area. The advances made in the last couple of decades are quite significant. This book describes the techniques that were state-of-the art many years ago. The extra chapters in part II of the book do not cover the new techniques in sufficient depth. Therefore it is my opinion that the book has only historical value. I regreted buying it and I propose the book by Ferziger & Peric for the engineer/scientist who wants to seriously get involved with CFD.
1,Too Heavy and Too Powerful,I have to say - I was very disappointed in this blow dryer. I researched quite abit before buying and am quite good with hair so did not anticipate any issues at all. It was a lot heavier than I thought - okay I can deal with that - but it just blew my hair all over - no control. It even blew the attachments off the end. My hair looked awful. I tried it for 2 weeks before buying a new professional blowdryer which I now love.
3,Nothing special,"I researched and read reviews to try and find the best hair dryer for the type of hair I have, thick, curly frizzy. After reading 100's of reviews this hair dryer sounded great and just what I was looking for. I have used it for the last 6 weeks and it really is no different that the $20.00 hair dryer I could have purchased at the drug store. It does the job but no noticiable heat, air or drying time difference. It is also heavier than I thought it would be."
5,Fantastic,"This hair dryer is awesome! Dries my thick hair fast and straight. I don't think it's too heavy at all. It gets really hot, but has a cooler setting I haven't used yet. The buttons may be a little bit in the way and my thumb bumps one of them every now and then, but it's really not that bad."
5,Solia Ionic Hair Dryer,"This product actually DOES make a difference in the condition of my hair--smoother, less frizzy--great news for me! It arrived immediately, too."
2,Not hot enough,"This was a poor purchase for me. I went on a recommendation from a hair professional. Not enough heat or air to do the job and I have fine, wavy hair. Went right back."
3,Solia hair dryer,"definitely disappointed in my first professional hair dryer. It doesn't get real hot and it is so powerful that you can't dry your hair without getting a ton of knots. I have pretty long and thick hair which goes down to about mid back and I bought this dryer partly because the prior reviews said it was great for that type of hair and cutting drying time in half. So not true. Next time I need a hair dryer I'll go to the drug store and buy the old cheapy's. Works just as well, if not better and will save me a good $50.p.s husband wants all to know that it's not him writing this review :)"
5,Hairdryer,"I ordered the Solia 1875W Thermal Ionic Hair Dryer and am very impressed! I never have frizzy fly-aways anymore! The only thing I caution is when you have thin hair, like I do, using the attachments are a necessity. Without them, your hair will tangle because of the strength of the air flow. Otherwise, I am very pleased. Thank you!"
5,It is pretty good.,It is a great product and I like it a lot compared to my old cheap hair dryer. It is not noisy but very powerful.
4,Christmas present for my wife,"She is very pleased with its performance. It is difficult for me to evaluate that, but it was purchased due to ratings for its potential longevity."
1,"Despite other bad reviews, I bought it and it didn't work",A hair dryer without heat? Yep. So I ignored the other buyers and figured they just got unlikely. I had to return it at my expense.
2,Good for Ashtanga?,"This yoga rug was not comfortable for me. Unless you spray water in the hands and feet spots, it will slip until you work up a good sweat. Aside from that, I don't understand how people use a yoga rug daily without it smelling like BO. Do they wash it everyday? This didn't work for me, but Ashtangis tend to love the rug."
5,Excellent ignition wires,You just can't beat NGK ignition wires. They fit perfectly. The boots on both ends have a nice snug fit. I have used NGK products for years and never been disappointed.
4,"Super Hits Of The '70s: Have A Nice Day, Vol. 3 Review","If you're ""into"" music from this era, this is a great CD. I've almost worn the grooves off of my copy. Good selection of hits!"
1,Not My Usual eb5,"Sorry, but I have to be honest here. I have been using eb% facial cream for at least 15 years and found it to be the best cream for me. I love the way it has preserved my skin, and I often get compliments on what beautiful skin I have. That's pretty special for someone who is now 77 years old!However, the shipment of eb5 I got from Amazon was unsatisfactory. It had a very unpleasant odor, was not as creamy as what I was used to, and my only conclusion is that the product was old and was past its useful life. I returned it after only one use and proceeded to the local department store to purchase my eb5.So, I love eb5 but not the eb5 that was in my shipment from Amazon. Sorry."
5,Can't Beat This Cream!,"My mother introduced me to eb5 Facial Cream about 20 yrs ago. I balked at the expense and the difficulty in finding it. I would buy several jars and when I ran out, I'd try other creams. I always returned to eb5 because I could use a single cream on my face (which has normal and dry areas) and count on good all day performance. After much experimentation, I have found that over the years, this remains a great product for me (unlike other products which I've had to change as my skin ages). Mom is now in her late 80's (looks like 60) and is also still using her eb5. It's a real treat to be able to subscribe for renewals of this product through amazon.com. No more hunting and it's discounted below store retail. Can't ask for more!"
4,Face Saving Cream,"I started using Eb5 about 1 week ago, and really didn't notice anything dramatic. After about the first week, I noticed that my crow's feet don't look so noticeable anymore, and my laugh lines have diminished some. I am very pleased with this product so far, and I hope to look amazingly better the more I use it."
5,Propaganda ART,"This is a great book. So many images. I was expecting mostly communist propaganda posters, and a lot of the same message in similar style over and over - but there is so much more. In fact most of the images are more art or paintings than posters. Tons of images - and notice - 14.5"" - this book is HUGE! Another good source book by Taschen."
4,Modern chinese posters,"This great book is about ""modern"" chinese propaganda posters. This means that you won't find any ""war"" or ""fighting the enemy"" poster in the mood of soviet war propaganda posters.But it shows perfectly how communism deals with imaginery and everyday life: posters about good behaviour, attention to the oldest people, school attitude and respect between country and city workers.A lesson of visual propaganda for a era (1954-1981) obsolete and out of time."
4,MAO all the way?,"The posters are arranged according to the ""red book"" and not chronology, that's give them the correct social content.The forward articles are very interesting. At 11$ this is a good buy."
5,Great product,We use these poly pockets inside files for extra papers to be inserted into. The quality is great and we highly recommend them.
4,Nice Presentation,"I bought these for labeling shelves in my classroom. This allows me to create labels that can change as the items do. I like how sleek and professional looking they are. However, they do not stick very well and can easily be peeled off by inquisitive 4 year-olds. I haven't tried sticking them to paper but am rather referring to stickiness in terms of wood and plastic. I simply put some packing tape over them to hold them down permanently on these surfaces and am otherwise completely satisfied with this product."
2,Tilly's Birthday,"My daughter didn't find this book had much essence to it. Just a light story and probably a good introduction to puberty, but she watned more."
3,Just okay.,"The pull is not a strong as advertised - I have a 50lb that is much stronger. The biggest flaw is the paint. It is not a flexible coating at all; the first time you flex it to install the string, it will crack and chip off in flakes."
3,slightly longer than standard,"recieved item quickly,great price too,but replacement bow was thinner & 'longer than the original 80lb. bow that came with my cross-bow pistol. i could not get the string on it , so I cut off both flared ends & used a coping saw created two new flared ends to accept plastic caps.After some creative re-engineering it appears to work fine.Time will tell if it lasts. spend a little more & get the 'thicker & right size replacement bow because this one comes about 2 inches too long to accept standard 80 lb. replacement string or maybe they are all not one size. i have two crossbow pistols & this replacement fit neither until i cut it to fit.Maybe there are different sizes that vary an inch or more i don't know."
2,Dissapointed in the purchase,"The limb separted while trying to thread it. I then bought a replacement limb, got that in the mail and was able to thread it but the first shot off of the bow pistol, the end piece at the end of the limb fell off and broke. I am not happy with the product. I bought this as a gift and I am bummed that it didn't work out how I had hoped it would."
5,Fine Blade For Fine Edger,This blade complements the best edger I have ever owned. I have reviewed the edger and can't really expound on just a blade. It does the job it is intended to do and does it well.
3,SO So,"This book is ok, it's not as good as Jones' other book, but it was still interesting none the less.. But definitely worth checking out is his book Haunted Houses of Britain and Ireland"
5,Serious Patterns about Cute Stuff,Finally patterns about all those things we loved as kids. I got this CD as soon as I saw it was available and truly am impressed with the quality of the patterns. I use it to make quilts and wall hangings! Great for gift giving.
4,Brazil-Amazon,"This book attempts to cover the whole gamut of wildlife for the Amazon basin and Pananal. It can't do it; no book can. It did make an admirable attempt and as such is a great book for the tourist traveling to the area. On a recent trip north of Manaus, it covered 98% of the bird life. It is concise enough that the occaisional bird wathcer will be able to identify most birds. It is not quite as adequate for other species- fish are very superficial, as are reptiles. I would like to see these expanded. This is a terrific guide for the tourist- concise, adequately complete, and easy to use."
3,What kind of wood is PLASTIC?,"Hey guys at Amazon! Did anyone there notice that this 'professional wooden recorder' is actually a TOY(a very nice one) PLASTIC RECORDER!!!? Here's a clue..ToysRUs is not the first place anyone would think about if they wanted a Professional Wooden Recorder!!! I happen to own one of these (thanks, Walmart), and it would be a good choice for a grade school student or beginning adult..but no professional I know of would use a PLASTIC recorder."
1,low quality - not worth the money,"Tried to use the recorder many times. Poor tone, poorly made. No adjusting would result in clear intonation."
1,Not Wooden Recorder,"Somebody goofed. This is not a wooden recorder, and is not a professional grade even of resin (plastic) recorders. It it a scam? Perhaps not. There are decent student grade plastic recorders although if you can buy it at WalMart or Toy-R-US the odds are that its a worthless plastic recorder that will torture you to have to listen to it. You don't just buy one as a toy and expect your children to play it. There are also worthless wooden recorders. Before buying one check with your local Recorder instructor at school or other performer. Think, if it costs less than $5.00 then it probably wasn't worth $5.00."
4,365 Buddha,I was looking for a Buddha calendar with daily messages and ended up purchasing this book as I could not find it. I placed it next to my computer so that I would start my day off with a reading. I still perfer the daily calendar version but this is one that I can use year after year. Shipping was prompt and I like the size of the book as I can take it with me when I travel.
3,Not as Good as I Had Hoped,"While many of the quotations are insightful and memorable, there seems to be no rhyme nor reason to the book's organization. As a result, I could myself inspired on one page but confused on the next."
5,Very comprehensive and Informative,"This is an excellent book on the subject of household plumbing. Well written, interesting, and based heavily on primary, 19th century documents. The author takes one from the 1840s through the 1890s and describes not only the available facilities, but the reasons and thought processes behind them. Well researched and very comprehensive and informative!"
4,Another solid set.,"This disc will bring back some pleasant memories. Any disc with ""Drift Away"" on it is almost worth purchasing no matter what else is on it. This one just happens to have ""Brother Louie"" ""It Never Rains In Southern California"" and ""Stuck In The Middle With You"". The sound quality is exceptional, just like any disc by Rhino."
4,70'S HAVE A NICE DAY VOL 10,"AS I WAS PLAYING THE SONGS I WAS SO SURPRISED THAT I NEW MOST OF THE WORDS. IT IS A VERY NICE MIXTURE OF SONGS FROM THAT DECADE. I ENJOY IT VERY MUCH, AND I PLAY IT VERY LOUDLY......"
3,It wasn't bad,"It was a good book, but the ending was much too rushed. Another chapter of epilogue would have been great. Only thing I can think is that he knew he would be writing more in the series and didn't think a proper ending was necessary. The tank battles in this book were sweet, but for infantry fighting the Guns of Tanith was a better book."
3,excellent,"an excellent book, if abit 'wordy' by today's standards... some may be put off by the commentary on 19th century artistic circles by the author, but knowledge about the setting of its writing will explain the seemingly unrelated detours. While not that lurid by our modern de-sensitized tastes, its depiction of supposed Satanic Black Mass rituals were a HUGE shock to the general public upon its release in 1891, and in fact, in many areas the book was banned."
5,"Brilliant Translation, Beautiful Edition","Dedalus publishers has outdone itself: this brilliant translation of JK Huysman's darkest and most controversial work arrives housed in a gorgeous softcover edition with cover art by fin-de-sicle artist Aubrey Beardsley.Huysmans was an unapologetic royalist whose simultaneous lives in bohemia and the Church led to some rather perverse artistic output. ""A Rebours"", an earlier work, was heavily influenced by the poetry of Baudelaire and served as a strong influence on Oscar Wilde. ""La Bas"" is far beyond that worthy text -- it embraces depravity with a slow, sure stranglehold that you don't notice until it leaves you gasping for breath.If you are interesting in reading and collecting historic decadent or transgressive literature, this edition will serve your needs well. As always with material from this era, it is very helpful to have a cursory knoweldge of fin-de-siecle' art and culture if you wish to reach a full understanding of the text."
3,Forgotten Oldies,"I purchased Vol.4 of the Have A Nice Day series because it contained ""Stay Awhile"" by the Bells. Although it was a Top Ten song in 1971,I never hear it on the radio anymore. I work for Mix 106 in Charlotte, NC and we do play some of the cuts on this cd including: ""Rose Garden"", ""Mr. Bojangles"", ""Help Me Make It Through The Night"" and ""For The Good Times"". Those are all good additions to my music collection.The 1970's seemed to have a large number of ""One-Hit Wonders"". Although these songs were popular at the time, many don't receive airplay in the 21st century. Thank you Rhino for giving us an oppotunity to obtain some of the Forgotten Oldies of the 70's on cd."
3,Fair Assortment of Pop Tunes,"More tough-to-find AM hits from the 70s are here in their original forms, but some filler also makes an appearance--tracks like Glass Bottle's ""I Ain't Got Time Anymore"" and Matthews Southern Comfort's ""Woodstock"" don't stand up well next to bigger hits like ""Rose Garden"" by Lynn Anderson or ""Put Your Hand in the Hand"" by Ocean. Still, a decent CD with good sound quality."
5,Lots of Favorites,I truly enjoy listening to this CD. What's extra special is that I can sing along with almost every song! What fun!
5,"""THE"" perfect, classic hoody for casual Saturdays!","This is my first purchase from Yummy Mommy, and I'll absolutely be back! I was looking everywhere for a basic, classic zip-up hoody in a lighter weight and NO athletic company emblems on it. I found this one on Amazon...ordered it on a Friday...received it in the mail that MONDAY! This sweat jacket is sooooo soft and is exactly what I wanted, and I'll be wearing it with everything. Being a mom, I also love the ""Yummy Mommy"" emblem!"
3,Too old for technology but good for lessons learned,"I bought this book mainly to learn issues with Microsoft Access. I have two other Alison Balter's Access books and I think they are great. This one is a bit disappointing to me because many of the old Access features no longer apply to Access 2007/2010. Nevertheless, many issues/recommendations discussed in this book are still good and valid. If you are upgrading an Access database from Access 2003 or an old version to Access 2007/2010, then this is a useful book to have."
2,Beware of the Title,"Though this book has a very broad/general title (Access 2002 Enterprise Development), going through the book you'll find chapter after chapter specifically on SQL Server. Since I'm using Access with another DBMS, the ""majority"" of the chapters in this book are worthless to me and not worth reading. A better title for this book would have been ""Using Access 2002 with SQL Server"". Had that been the case, I would not have bought it."
1,Not worth the money,"This book looks good at first glimpse but then it falls apart. The admittedly stylish graphic design cannot compensate for the small pictures, the trite prose, and the old ideas. I expected this book to offer something really fresh but it didn't. I feel majorly ripped off."
4,underappreciated,"This is a typically entertaining entry in Himes' Coffin Ed Johnson/Grave Digger Jones series. The two Harlem police detectives investigate a stabbing at a wake and the usual cast of colorful characters--gamblers, pool sharks, holy-roller preachers, etc.--are on hand.Himes may well be the best black American author of all time. It seems he was sold short by serious critics because of his status as a ""crime writer"" & perhaps by mystery fans because of his race, but it appears a major reappraisal of his work is underway and he is finally getting his due.GRADE: B"
4,Great short stories,"The country of Estonia is one of the smallest in the world to be separated by its language. As a result, most Estonian literature has gone untranslated. The flip side of this coin, of course, is that Estonia has produced a great deal of unique literature which reflects those elements of its culture that are most salient. This collection introduces several of Estonia's most well-know writers (Kross) and a wide selection of younger ""fringe"" writers to an audience unfamiliar with Estonian literature. The translations are masterful, and even those stories which are not ""great"" still manage to fascinate. Highly recommended for anyone looking to break out of the same-old Western European model of literature... this stuff is sure to please."
1,unreadable and turgid,"One of the worst examples of Crowley's self-edited poems, ""Aha!"" is notable only for the utter lack of grace of its phrasing and its pretentiousness."
2,Tiresome,"Aleister Crowley was doubtless one the the 20th Century's greatest proponents of sex magick. While not a Satanist as so many false rumors claim, he was, rather, something of a Promethean. Nonetheless, his ""Aha!"" suffers from a singular lack of imagination and typlifies what sometimes appeared in ""Equinox"". Skeptic Martin Garner perhaps said it best when he observed that the only thing Crowley worshipped was himself"
1,Unbearably bad poetry,"Crowley is a maddening author, full of wisdom and insight and equally full of outrageous lies and obnoxious egotism. This is one of the examples of the latter; it's basically just extremely bad poetry pertaining to his particular teachings, at least the ones he was trumpeting at the time he wrote it. If you want to find out more about Crowley, ""Magick Without Tears"" and ""The Book of the Law"" are far more enlightening and inspired than this book, which is quite frankly tripe, and very rank tripe at that."
4,Great mainstream rock & roll,"This album starts off sounding like Rush and ends up sounding like REO Speedwagon, and in the middle hits upon everything that made rock great in the 80's. It's a shame that no US label has the guts to sign these guys (who are from New Jersey, I believe), because the album really has broad appeal. Hard rockers, ballads, acoustic-guitar driven 3-minute gems -- they're all in there. There are one or two songs that don't measure up to the others, but they're easily forgiven due to the overall quality of the production. Yeah, it costs more because it's an import, but it's worth it."
5,Cheerio tunes!,"I love this CD! I love the upbeat, catchy tunes that put a skip in your step! I like to listen to this at breakfast...a great companion for my Cheerios!"
4,Best I've found!!,"I have a Kohler sink that has a lip above the countertop. I have been searching high and low for a drainboard that will accommodate this. I ordered this and it wasn't high enough. But, being it has a rigid back, I was able to put 3 plastic door stoppers (actual rubber door stoppers to keep your door from swinging open or closed) under the back and it works fantastic!! It's very small and compact and just what I was looking for. Those of you that have a Kohler sink, try this, it works great, so far!! I've tried the door stoppers on the rubber drainboards with no back support and it just was a catastophre!!"
4,Pyle ceiling spkr,"Easy install. Looks good. Not really any stereo separation. Overall good sound quality.For my powder room, this speaker did the job."
1,Nothing to see here...,The whole whopping 50 minutes of video is filled with B-Roll footage that didnt make it into the first two. There is no dialogue the film goes nowhere and says nothing substantial... high school kids can make a way more interesting video piece on graffiti than this. Not worth 30 bucks much less 10...
3,Good but not my favorite,"I read this book after ""The Horse Whisperer"" which I truly enjoyed. Although I emjoyed the ""Smoke Jumper"" there were times it slowed down a little too much and it took awhile to get up and going again. It is a story of romance, friendship and heros. There is a hidden romance between two people but they are unable to show any emotion toward each other because she is married to his best friend. It is a good book but I didn't feel it was as gripping as some of my other favorites."

1,Is he ready yet?,"It's been about eighteen years since I first viewed and listened to John Corigliano's opera, The Ghosts of Versailles. I was hoping I would have a better understanding or appreciation of it. All I can say is that, in this piece, Corigliano demonstrated that he could write in many modes and styles. Forget about the overwrought libretto. So, anyway, now that we know he has these talents, we're still waiting for him the write a real opera."
1,This game is dumb,This is the worst fighting game on gameboy color. All they do is wigle thier fingers and legs to fight. It is very boring and stuped. If you want to get a goood fighting game get Street Fighter Alpha for gameboy color.
1,Awful...Just Awful,"I bought X-Men:Mutant Academy as an X-Men fan. I wanted to like it, but it was just awful. The graphics suck, the sounds are cheap, and the whole game itself is all around cheesey. No way that this game is worth the money; go buy some X-Men comics instead."
1,:(,"This game was pretty depressing. The best picture you will see is the 'start' screen. I like the moves, but they could've been more character-based. More characters should be available, and there should definitely be more variety in backdrops. It is very expensive for its value, so I'm glad I won it for free."
3,Um............OK,"I rented this game being a very big x-men fan, and was only a little disappointed because if the game is called, x-men mutant ACADEMY, i would expect the game to actually teach you the moves, but it doesn't!!! Other than that it was a great game!!!! the graphics are good considering its only a game boy color, its fun, challenging and hard to learn the moves. But truthfully, i wouldn't pay much for this game, i would wait until the price went down..."
4,X-men on the Small Screen,"I am not a big fighting game fan-I only enjoy it when I enjoy the characters...so that's why I picked this up. It is great fun, and has pretty decent graphics. The selection of characters is good(I don't know who the second hidden character us but the first is Jean Grey)-one big down fall is the ""rage"" moves can sometimes be hard to do and are easily blocked. It's Game Boy so don't expect fireworks...expect firecrackers-which is just what you get. A good fun game that has a high replay value!"
1,Game tip,"Another game tip from me: to win at any difficulty level, go towards you opponent, duck, then hit A or B (your choice) to make the enemy's energy bar shorter and shorter until, you guessed right, he's dead. Repeat that nine times and... you beated the game! don't bother with the few special moves of the character, they make the game harder."
3,Average would be the best choice of words,"This game is at best OK. I wouldn't reccomend it if you were looking for a game that you can play over and over and will last a long time. The controls on this are sticky and rarely work how you want them too. The controls seem relatively simple, but believe me, they are not. Graphics are definitely an upside. Very colorful environents help to compliment the detailed and easily visible X-Men. There are 9 playable characters plus 2 hidden characters. If you own a Playstation, I would reccomend buying the PSX version of this game, but don't hesitate to buy this game if you're a big X-Fan, it is fun, it's just not a classic, epic game like the Legend of Zelda."
1,Yet another poor X-Men game,"Here is yet another poor X-Men game for the GBC courtesy of Activision, only this one is the worst. While the PS1 version of X-Men: Mutant Academy wasn't half bad, this GBC conversion is downright terrible thanks to the clunky controls, insanely easy difficulty, bland backgrounds, and scratchy sound. While the player animations are colorful, they are quite jerky, and while the selection of fighters is nice, there is just something more to be desired. All in all, even if your the biggest X-Men fan, leave this game on the shelf, it's terrible."
2,Oh dear.,"Not so much a game as a mild thumb workout, 'Mutant Academy' looks nice (it's by the same people who did the excellent GBC version of 'Street Fighter Alpha') but is much too easy. You can quite literally win every fight by holding down 'right' and pressing the 'A' button extremely quickly, and it's surprising that the creators didn't spot this before they released the game. There are plenty of X-people to play as, and there's a handy 'VS' mode so that you can bore a friend, but unless you deliberately handicap yourself this isn't much of a game, which is a shame as there aren't many decent beat-em-ups on the GBC."
5,Maybe needs a new title,"The title False or Lost Gospels may be a bit misleading. Early Christianity was surrounded by a complex world of religious diversity and many times other groups tried to 'borrow' from each other to help earn converts to their religion. In reality, that's what Gospels like Thomas, Judas, etc are all about tryin to create interest in Gnosticism by using well known names of people well known to Christians. This video makes that clear--unlike some others that try to see the Gnostics as an off shoot of Christianity (instead of a seperate religious group with Greek roots). This video is a good example of explaining a somewhat complicated situation in an understandable way."
1,propaganda,"Unfortunately this dvd was just a propaganda exercise by the catholic church, it only showed how narrow church zelots are."
5,Unprecedented quality,"Amazing, truly amazing. This monitor is the greatest LCD I have ever seen. I needed to replace my CRT with an LCD because the radiation coming off of the CRT gave me constant headaches. I was reluctant to switch to an LCD though because I heard that their color saturation and image quality was far inferior to ""tubes"". The LG Flatron L1720P was a pretty expensive monitor when I bought it but I just couldnt believe how great its image looked. I would recommend the LG Flatron L1720P to anyone, even someone looking for a CRT monitor."
4,Gift Bracelet,"Was a gift for my step-mother for her 71st birthday - she loved it, and it was beautiful; the quality was very good and it looks more expensive than it was."
3,I don't get it.,"I keep coming back to this bracelet to find a better description of what it is supposed to represent. Quoted Counting Birthdays Bracelet? What does that mean? What does it count? What did the designer mean? Does one select stones? Does one exchange stones as time goes on? Does one add to it as time goes on.I have been attracted to this bracelet for some reason, for well over a month at least, yet I can't figure out what I am seeing and what I would be buying if I got it. It may have been just the right gift for my niece this past November...may have been. May be perfect for anyone. If the whole idea was clear...I've kept it on my wish list...WISH I could learn if it should be on my shopping list.m.wall, smile"
5,Small but Great Overview of Buddhism +++,"""BUDDHISM FOR THE WEST, containing four comprehensive chapters covering the Founder and also the three great Branches of Buddhism, Theravada, Mahayana and Vajrayana, plus a personal ""Colophon"", is written from a fresh viewpoint -- that of a Western student who has experienced, and felt deeply, the need for a workable philosophy and a fuflilling way of life, simply presented, and pecularly applicable to the problems of today."" [from front inside jacket cover]"
2,Don't bother...,"This book has many factual mistakes that are just stupid mistakes such as confusing the order of Keaton's sons. There were only 2 of them so how hard can it be to get the order right?Also, Dardis writes things that seems rather unlikely to have happened then does not back the ""facts"" in his notes such as Keaton's second wife prostituting herself at the Biltmore Hotel with his sister's help! What the hell? One shocking thing he writes is some comment about Keaton ""may have"" lost the tip of his finger in a clothes wringer. What's this ""may have""? I don't think there's any question about it. Keaton himself said he crushed it in a clothes wringer and back then something like that was a common occurrence. The one good thing about this book is it has excellent pictures-pictures I've never seen in any other books about Keaton."
2,Mixed up,"This book has many things to recommend it, but many more not to. The oddest thing is when Dardis describes Keaton's second wife (twice he says she was a very attractive brunette - actually she was rather witchy-looking) and he goes on to say that she dumped him when she'd had enough of his drinking. Not true. She was a golddigging conniver who Keaton actually got rid of himself. He stopped drinking once he had.Many other factual mistakes, but worse than those are his take on Buster. He seems not to respect him much. Why write this bio? He talks little of the artistry of the man."
1,It's Garbage!,"There's a factual mistake on nearly every page of this book. Dardis is obsessed with Keaton's drinking, spending some 80 pages of the book on this subject, while cutting the last 25 years of Keaton's life to a mere 20 pages.In short, this Dardis book is uniformed, inaccurate, unbalanced, and unhinged. However, despite all this, the Dardis bio is still somethat superior on the Marion Meade book, which is even worse. A solid Keaton bio has yet to be written."
3,A Good Term Paper ....,"But not a Biography. I agree with most of the reviewers regarding this book. There are some pretty great photos and some quotes I had never seen and Dardis does give some new insights into Keaton's life, but the rest is just mediocre and some is of dubious source. For a really great Biography,try the works of Imogen Sara Smith's and Edward McPherson. After reading both biographies you will have a well-rounded view of Keaton the man and the filmaker."
2,Most uninformative book I have ever purchased from Burpee.,I was very dissappointed in the dead ends I found in the complete Gardener and 3D Design CD.Although informative I found the pest and desease section of this book left too many questions and gave no more than general information.
5,Belated review 14 years later...,"I read Sarah Gordon's book 14 years ago. This railfan became aware of the Quinnipiac University professor's book when she was interviewed by CSPAN founder Brian Lamb on one of his Book Notes programs. Made a note to obtain a copy from Amazon, pronto, and remember it to this day to be a memorable read.I 'second' all of the positive comments by ""Train Chaser."" His writing ""I am pretty certain hard core 'train' fanatics will not like it"" belies an unfortunate trap that some (many?) ""hard core"" adherents of all ilks fall into, that being, they become so wrapped up in themselves that they can't step back and 'smell the roses', as it were.Passage to Union... A GREAT READ!"
3,Less than impressed,"I bought this album for the song ""I Put A Spell on You."" Unfortunatley it is not the version of the song I wanted. It's a good version, but I wanted the one with all the vocal sound effects that got it banned. I heard it on a jukebox in a bar where it is a crowd favorite, so I know that version is available somewhere. Well then, the rest of the album. There are some interesting songs here, but if this is the best of Mr. Hawkins, then ummmm, he wasn't the best in the world. I could see myself playing a few of the songs as rare treats, but listening to the album all the way thru is not something I can't wait to do. I'm sure his stage act was great and ahead of its time, but unless you're a real Hawkins fan this album might dissappoint you. Buy it when the price goes down."
4,...the feast of the Mau Mau has begun!....,"The perfect companion to the AMAZING compliation ""Cow Fingers & Mosquito Pie!"" Only gets a 4 star because RHINO failed to include such Screamin' Jay classics as ""Bite It"" and ""Hong Kong."" But it DOES include the rockin' ""DO YOU REALLY LOVE ME"" and the spooky ""I Hear Voices"". And of course, there IS the greatest of them ALL...""CONSTIPATION BLUES!""....""the band & I have just retrned from the general hospital..."" WORLD CLASS SCREAMIN' JAY!!! Makes you want to run to the bathroom and ""pinch one!"" SCREAMIN' JAY RULES!!!!!!!!"
5,Everything You Were Never Allowed To See!!,"Hosted by Douglas Fairbanks Jr. and Peter Fonda with special appearances by Carroll Baker,Don Murray,Sheree North,Jane Russell,Martin Scorcese,Mamie Van Doran and Eli Wallach.Hollywood Uncensored exposes it all,in this controversial and fascinating look at the history of Hollywood censorship.You're in for a rare look at scandal.For example,The highly exploitative scenes of Shirley Temple playing a Mae West-like seductress-or the banned scenes from""King Kong"",even the disturbing use of violence in""Taxi Driver"" has erupted into National Debate.Plus,there's the totally outrageous excesses of Road Show Filmakers-whose Cult Classic Shockers like ""Reefer Madness"" and ""The Love Life Of A Gorilla"" tittillated audiences from an earlier era which makes this film a ""Superb Documentary""concerning Hollywood Censorship that's very well worth watching!!"
4,Island retreat,This is a thoroughly enjoyable book filled with vivid descriptions of St. Kitts and its people. Joan's style of writing enables the reader to be swept away into the relaxing lifestyle of island living. Her humorous tales are interspersed with many historical facts about the Caribbean.
5,Discover St. Kitts,"Anyone interested in the Caribbean will enjoy this book. Beautifully written, it explores the magnificence of St. Kitts and captures the spirit and soul of the island's people. Personal experiences and fascinating anecdotes provide colorful examples of ""de life."""
1,Live De Life: Caribbean Island Style,"Book was boring!!!!!! Can't believe I finished it. Great idea for a book, but author spent too much time telling history or talking (on and on) about people from the island. Was expecting more adventures."
5,The Best Of The Marcels,"I bought my husband this cd for Christmas and his birthday. Everytime we're in the car, he plays it. Love the music. I couldn't have picked a better present for him."
2,Not impressed so far,"This is billed as a Sync and Charger cable for the Zune but so far I have been unable to get it to sync. It seems to be charging and there is some recgonition by my computer that there is a device plugged in, but when I open my Zune software it asks me to connect my Zune. I've tried unplugging and reconnecting it dozens of times with no luck.At this point I'm testing it to see how it does on the charging aspect. That is what I purchased it for anyway. To put with a wall wart so I can keep my Zune charged at work. If it charges okay I'll keep it, if it doesn't then it's going back."
4,Born Bad Turns Out To Be Good,"This movie is rather unusual, however, I strongly recommend the purchase. It is about teens robbing a bank while coping with problems between each other. It contains quite a few plot twists. Some may think it is poor because of the small actors. Although, they do quite a good job. I suggest that if you enjoy action dramas, then this movie is for you. However, you may dislike the few adolescent pranks. (The actors look like 30, not teenagers.) It warrants a rent, if not a purchase."
3,Plays like a bad imitation of Heat,"If you're going to do holdups, leave it to the likes of Michael Mann to do it right. This movie just doesn't seem to cut it in the area of suspense, action, or acting, for that matter."
4,Narrow fit,The shoe fits like a true 9N. Probably too narrow in front if you have a wide foot. Darker navy.
4,Comfortable shoe,"It is probably because I have a narrow heel that I rated this shoe 4 stars. It is comfortable and nice looking, but it is a little loose on my foot even with socks. I will just have to wear thicker socks. I wore it the first day and it never hurt my foot and felt good (though a little big in the heel) all day long. I am pleased with the dark brown color which is exactly what I was looking for. If you don't have a narrow heel, this shoe should fit you just fine."
1,Were not made well,These shoes did not fit. Were wider in the heel and gapped along the sides. I am going to have to try another brand.
5,Love these shoes,"I was waiting impatiently for Zappos to get these in brown, and I should have just checked Amazon! These are a great work shoe -- sleek and comfortable. These look great with jeans, slacks, even skirts and tights in a pinch. Fast service and good selection -- thanks!"
3,Too narrow.,"The shoe is great. Well made. Stylish. BUT. Like other reviewers noted, the shoe is much too narrow and is not true to size. Plus, Amazon charged $4.98 to return it rather than their usual free return-shipping. The product was actually defective in that the size is not true; so the return-shipping should have been free. But one cannot keep shoes that don't fit. So, I'm returning them."
2,Squeaky Shoe,"I Love the look of these shoes, however they heel is extremely hard and the left shoe of my black pair has an annoying squeak in it."
4,love these shoes,"I have always loved these shoes...they look great with slacks. However, they seem to be running smaller than what they used to be. I had a pair of 8 1/2 B, and they never hurt my feet. This new pair nearly killed me. I have been steching them out, but if I were to order again, the 8 1/2 is fine, the width has to be wider."
4,Great book of short topics,"This is one of those books that you read in one page sections. It is basically a collection of interesting questions that the author has answered while working for a magazine. The questions are fun and he gives pretty complete answers. The answers are usually about a page in length so if you want to read something for five minutes this book is perfect. The information is cool, I really enjoyed it. It gives you a lot of responces to questions you often hear."
3,VERY GOOD BOOK,this book is really good... i found it informative and interesting... i recomend iut to everyone
4,steamy yes. believable??,"First i want to say that the book was good, this is the first book i read by Ms. Foster. and i can't decide wether i want to read more. the scenes are all so vivid, but the book provoked no thought. I didnt get why noah would be so attracted to grace in the first place, and never know it?? well and then throughout the book you know what is going to happen in the end and there are no loops to throw you off. so you go through the whole book knowing more or less whats going to happen and you never get thrown any curve balls. but it was a nice quick read that i DID enjoy. I took it for what it was a fun book that would be perfect beach reading material."
3,Not so hot....,"If you really want to read something with steam, get BEYOND SEDUCTION by Emma Holly and if you want to read some scalding literature get OLDE HOLLYWOOD by Thorne Peters. This book was fairly hot, but, forgive me for saying this, the writing was very elementary and not compelling."
1,Don't Buy the Book,"I could have written a better romance novel. Most of the book was just raw sex that evoked asolutely no emotion in the reader. The book lacked substance, creativity, amusement, sexual tension, etc. I agree with the other bad reviews - don't buy the book."
2,Not Enough,"In comparison to ""Never Too Much"" I was greatly dissapointed. I didn't like Grace's character at all. She seemed to me to have very low self-esteem. She spent the first half of the book whining that she was fat and didn't seem to have any issue letting a man she loved use her for nothing more than sex. Noah's character was better but not much. I thought Noah was boring, my husband is more of a bad boy than him. He was engaged to a woman that his grandmother thought he should be engaged to. The woman wrongs him and he protects her. As for the fling it was pretty much of a yawn."
3,Maybe 5 stars for sensuality...,"So if that is what you want when you buy this book, then you'll defintely love it. The book is very erotic, no question about. But that is about all. When I bought this book I wanted to read the story of shy, beautiful Grace who's in love with dangerous yet sweet Noah and how they work through the obstacles facing them to finally realize they love each other. Instead all I got was one sex scene after another. Don't get me wrong, eroticism is great, but if that is what I was seeking, I would've just bought Kama Sutra!"
2,ho hum,"What a snoozer. I found Noah to be one of the more self-centered heroes (who obviously gets off on controlling a weak-willed, annoyingly naive woman). The heroine (what was her name again? Oh, yeah. Grace.) completely forgetable. Oh, except for her simpering virginal ""please please please"" can I drop to my knees for you? What, is she waiting for his permission? A strong heroine would just go for it, but with her we get ""whatever you want, Noah. You're the big strong man and I'm just an overweight, unattractive woman (in her own thoughts, and I wasn't convinced she ""got over it"" by the end, either) who is greatful that you deign to sleep with me."" I kept waiting for something interesting to happen that would make me believe these two really were meant to be together, and by the last page, I was still waiting. Too much temptation? I'm just sorry I was even TEMPTED to buy this book."
3,Spicy but story lacking,"One of the more disappointing books I've read by Ms. Foster. If I hadn't been stuck on a international flight, I'm not sure it would have been able to keep my attention long enough to finish it. I would recommend reading one of her other novels instead."
4,for mature adults only...,"...not because of the steamy [intimate] scenes (which are good) but because the plot promotes that silly ""Pretty Woman""-type fantasy: submit ...to a handsome rake, and he will fall in love with you and give you the intimacy you REALLY crave. You'd think that most readers over the age of 18 would know the difference between fantasy and reality. Some do. But plenty don't. Ignore the sexist metamessage, don't scrutinize the plot too closely, and enjoy the hot scenes featuring an ""actual size"" heroine."
2,WARNING !,"I love Lori Foster books, but this came out years ago with a different cover- look at the other reveiws- they are from 2002. I hate it when a publishing house does this.But if you've never read it is a great story."
5,Love this Book!,I not reading anything by Lori Foster I wasn't sure if I was going to like it. Like it? I LOVED this book. If was very refreshing to read a book where the main female character wasn't a size 2 or trying to be one. If you are looking for a night full of romance check out Lori Foster.
2,Disappointed,"I had never heard of Lori Foster before and reviews appealed to me. Unfortunately, I was disappointed. There was a great story line and some great scenes. There was enough character development to want more, to feel disappointed when the author would fall back on cliches and trite phrases. I couldn't understand why Gracie would allow her employer to abuse her verbally without walking away. When she did walk away from the job, she continued to take grief. I loved the fact that the heroine was not model thin and she did go after her dream guy. I'd like to read other books by Lori Foster as there was enough good writing in the book to make me think that she could be one of the best romance novelists. But she could benefit from a better editor as the grammatical mistakes were jarring."
1,Disappointing - a Plus Size flop,"Grace had no personality, very one dimensional character. Other than a few good moments and a lot of sex, this book has very little to recommend it. Any plus size woman whose fought the mirror and others impressions would find this book very disappointing. Go watch Bridget Jones, its at least funnier."
2,"A flabby, listless love story","Didn't Wally lamb wear out this concept in She's Come Undone already? I'm a Lane Bryant girl married to a Big & Tall man and I have had a loving, yes passionate, romance going for 11 years . . . and things aren't bad between my husband and I either . . . so what's the big deal about writing a Harlequin romance novel that doesn't have Fabio and Elle Mc Pherson on the cover? That said, this book was so poorly written; a bad copy of Nora Roberts style, and dialogue that was just too conversational. This was my second--- and last--- Lori Foster novel."
1,May not be the worst book I've ever read...,"...but it is the worst one I can think of.Chubby virgin (I think her name was Gracie, but it doesn't really matter) meets sexy man with big c__k and becomes his sex slave. After that, they fall in love and live happily ever after or something (I started skimming after around page 150, just so I wouldn't have to gouge my eyes out).Basically, the story is a thin set of scenes to play out between the porn.Skip this garbage!"
3,"OK, but not great....","This is the first book I've read by this author, I picked it up because of all the wonderful reviews and the sequel being released, but ended up missing what others seem to find so great. This is a quick, undemanding read, but there is certainly a lot better out there. While the language is a bit ""earthier"" than you'll find in a Nora Roberts/Susan Elizabeth Phillips, the romance was less and the characters/plot line practically undeveloped. Much is being written about Grace not being a ""skinny girl"", but you're never really sure if she is large, or only large compared to super-models. I mean, if her Dr says she's OK weight for her size (which she says he does), then is she really an over-weight person, or just tremendously insecure? And why does she only become attractive to other males after Noah has had intamacy with her?I give this 3 stars because it is readable and cute, but I won't be recommending this author to others."
2,"Lots of sex, but not much else","Too Much Temptation is the story of an overweight, inexperienced sweet young woman who enters into a sexual relationship with a gorgeous, worldly man. This story is very much a traditional romance; Grace Jenkins has been in love with Noah Harper for years and her desire is simply that he will fall in love with her. The antogonist, Noah's grandmother and Grace's boss, does everything she can to keep the two apart. However, she really doesn't provide much conflict to the story. Whatever obstacle is thrown in their path, Grace and Noah navigate with little difficulty.The book is billed as ""A Novel of Erotic Romance,"" and if you are looking for a straight romance with lots of rather graphic sex, then this book will meet your expectations. But don't expect much more than that."
2,Too Little Temptation!,"I guess that we've given up expecting too much from authors, because this novel is run of the mill yet highly regarded.There was no build up and no release, it just sort of laid there going thru the motions. It was caricature driven and the ""steamy situations"" were predictable and therefore anticlimactic in their inevtiability.This book embodies my pet peeve with the formulaic installment writers that read and write alike time after time. You could write one synopsis that could be applied to nearly everything they've written and that is a terrible syndrome."
3,"Good story - a little far fetched, but nice fantasy","Overall a really nice story by Lori Foster. Features a self-professed ""chubby"" heroine, and a super hot self-made type guy who is on the rebound from a broken engagement. Well told story, interesting characters and lots of chemistry between the two leads. I know that romances are supposed to be fantasies, but the one negative thing abot this book was it was a little hard to suspend my disbelief in this story. The guy falls in love with her literally in days and starts talking about marriage and babies. Does this really happen in real life? It felt like kind of a stretch even for a romance novel. I did like the story though, it was very cute and had a great ending that made me happy. Overall I would recommend this - it is a fun read."
4,"Great Entertainment- Sexy, Hot and lots of Fun","I really enjoyed this book. Take a sexy voluptuous woman that is beautiful and smart, pair her up with a brooding, sexy alpha male, and add a little overbearing and manipulative grandmother and you have a great story. Grace is not exactly comfortable in her own skin, Noah is the man to show her just how beautiful, sexy she can be, and how much a man can want her. Norah has a past that still haunts him and does not quite believe he is worth the love of a woman, especially someone as wonderful as Grace. His quest for hot, and I mean scorching, uncomplicated sex ends up being more than he bargained for. I loved Grace's constant need to defend and stand up for Norah against anyone even against himself. There are some really funny moments as well as passionate love scenes. All in all it is a good book to cuddle with on a cold to help keep you warm."
4,Sassy and Satisfying,"This was the first Lori Foster book for me. I really enjoyed Grace's spunk. She was definatly no pushover. There were many wonderful passionate scenes between Noah and Grace. My only complaint (this may sound silly but I think some will share my view!) is the use of the word c*ck. For me that word takes a bit of the sensuality out of scenes that were meant to be ""loving."" I don't mind it in rushed, unexpected passion, but not once the characters move beyond the sex and begin to have deeper feelings for each other. Anyway, just my thought but enjoyed the book and will surely read more from Lori Foster!"
3,Maybe a Little Too Much,"This was a good story, it really was, but I think Foster spent too much time on the sex sences and not enough on the relationship. I can't believe I'm saying that because normally I think the hotter the better but the sexual chemistry between Grace and Noah had a lot of potential and I wanted to have it drawn out a little more before jumping right to it and not stopping till the end of the book. As for the hottness of the sences, great! I just wanted more plot also. I realize this is a rerelease and I can't believe I missed it the first time around and now I'm wondering if there's a sequal with Noah's brother Ben. He made the book fun. I do sugest this book to any Foster fans because it's full of her trade mark of humor, hunky protective men, and steamy sex."
5,Noah...too hot !! Grace...perfect character !,I absolutely LOVED this book. Not that I haven't read 3 times already ! You will fall inlove with Noah !! Grace...not that is one of Lori Foster's best characters. Grace was tough in all the right situations and kind hearted as well. PLEASE DO NOT SKIP THIS BOOK OR YOU WILL BE SORRY !!!
3,Not too much temptation,"My first Lori Foster was the bundle with the four brothers, so I felt good about buying another one of her books especially this one that came so highly recommended by so many people. For that reason, I stuck with it, but in the end it was not that special. The writing was choppy, and the heroine was pitiful, and pretty one-dimensional. I started to believe she was not deserving of this guy after she said it one too many time. So unless Casey (Sawyer's son) comes out in Kindle format, I'm not going to be tempted any time soon to try another Lori Foster."
1,I thought The W's were a christian group,"darnit, none of these songs really fit the category of christian. Why? Who knows. Maybe they were tryin to appeal to more people. Some good beats, but if you want a christian album get somethin else"
5,what's the scoop?,"I just recently purchased The W's Trouble With X and am enjoying it tremendously! I grew up listening to Big Band (my Dad is a BIG fan of Big Band)so I can appreciate the style. I also have the WOW 2000 with The W's Rumor Weed song on it and that is what truly prompted me to buy this tape. Since I am a Christian, I just wondered where their walk is with God. Alot of people say U2 is a Christian band and I would never think that in a million years! I like to know where exactly a group is coming from...either you're hot or youre not. Which are they?"
1,I'd Rather Be Dead!,"Give me a break this is absoulutly not a christian album. The songs have a grreat tune but really bad lyrics if you are a christian do not get this cd. I think that they just used christians to get a start. DON'T BUY IT! PLEASE, IT IS JUST A WASTE OF MONEY!"
1,Christian group or not?,"What happened to the songs like ""The Devil is Bad?"" They now sing stuff like, ""With Out You Girl I Would Rather Be Dead."" If you are looking for a Christian group that praises God, DO NOT GET THIS CD!"
5,Great find!,This was for my boys they saw this band at Spirit West Coast. They liked this CD very much. Great find.
3,Quasi-Christian Album,"Musically ""Trouble with X"" is a major improvement. It is a unique ska/swing/rockabilly album, with a catchy music (they even include a banjo and other interments different from the first release.) Lyrically it is not straight up Christian, I did note that they mention the Apostle Paul but that is about it. I was really hoping for some songs that were straight up Christian. I just pray that they don't go down the MxPx or Amy Grant road, drifting away completely. But I thought the same of FIF, but then heard their live album on which they speak about God. I guess we will have to wait until the tour to truly find out. This album is not non-Christian by any means, it is more quasi-Christian, much like there first in that respect."
1,review,"The shoes were not as shown/ They appeared to be bulkier and sturdier but instead were a very minimal shoe...not one for a day of shopping when your feet need a lot of support. They were narrow meaning not much shoe sole on the ground. In summary, I was disapointed."
3,Its a MIDI cable,"As expected, excellent price compared to local options. Probably not as long-lasting as more robust cables, but fine for home use."
4,Great MIDI patch cables,"These 5 foot MIDI cables are perfect for connecting your MIDI gear to one another.Solid build quality, seems very durable.Short and sweet, just what I was looking for."
5,perfect,"This MIDI plug is perfect. Great for recording. I even bought 2 right away because of the price. 5 feet is sort of short so don't expect to have your MIDI board very far from your preamp, but really there is no reason to while recording."
5,Quality Cables,"The cables are great, good quality, works perfect, the shipping was really fast, the prices is ok, I'm very happy..."
2,The dog died,"We got this game for my daughter 2 days ago who just loves dogs but can't have one because of allergies. She didn't play on it a whole lot, and already the dog ""died"" on her. She was so upset (very sensitive girl). I think it's a bit much for a child when the screen comes up with ""your relationship with your dog is over"" or something like that. This game could have been written a whole lot better."
1,Terrible game for small children,"I will probably end up selling this game because I think it is terrible for small kids. My [...] son played it all day and ""raised"" his puppy. The dog ended up dying!!!! It doesn't mention that anywhere in the instructions for the game. Think carefully before buying this for a child."
4,FUN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,I Love this game soooooooooo much!!!!!!!!! i recomend it to you.but after a while it gets kinda boring...sorry! but this game is way cool and not to mention fun!!!!!! :)
2,Nintendogs Better,"the title says it all, folks out there! get nintendogs instead. but if u dont have a ds, fine get this or gba pocket dogs."
1,Horrible! Dont buy.,"This is a rip off of nintendogs. Get a Nintendo ds, Buy nintendogs instead and youwill be waaaaay happier."
4,"Fun,easy, and really cute!","This game is a lot of fun. I'm having a blast traing my Shiba-Inu, Twiz.First you pick a pooch,there must be a thousand choices. Then of coarse, you name it. At home you can feed your dog, teach him or her tricks, listin to music, play mini games, walk your dog, and clean the house!This game is great! The only thing is that you have your dog only for 20 game days. That's around an hour in real life. If you have a young or sensitive child this may not be the best. The dog is ""took away from you"" shortly. But don't worry! You can visit your pooch anytime!Just go to ""Forever Together Mode"" in the start menu.I REALLY recomend this game for un-sensitive children! Have fun! :)"
4,"don't listen to those reviews that say the dog ""dies""","Before buying this game i read all of the reviews and i noticed that most of them say that the dog ""dies"" well in truth it really doesn't die. it is taken away from you and then the game asks you if you want to save it and if you say yes then it saves it fopr you. after you save it you can go back and play with it any time you want. it does this so that after a certain amount of time if you don't like the dog you have you can switch and get a new dog and not feel obligated to stay with your one. sodon't listen to those reviews that say your dog ""dies"". after your dog is taken away just go to the main menu and switch it to forever together mode with your dog.so if you took my advice buy it for your kids and tell them your dog will be taken away but you get him/her back."
3,how the game works,"i thought playing the game would of been awsome but it ended up being short and sortive fun. i was able to get any dog, name it, train it walk it and pet it. i got to play my own games and have my own chores. it is ok for a kid the has a low attention span cus if you get bored or distracted you can repaly it anytime but for someone who wants to play a game for hours.. not a good idea. other then that i thought it was ok. my brother liked it. he 8yrs old."
1,Not for sensitive kids,"I would not recommend this game for very young children or kids with a sensitive heart unless you prepare them before they start the game. Our seven year old daughter was crushed when her dog ""went away"". After many tears and a web search I learned about the forever mode but unfortunately she had not saved the game so she couldn't go back and play with her puppy friend. I was able to recreate the same kind of dog with the same name and she was off and happy again, but this came after a very sad little girl. Make sure your child knows they get to play with their puppy for three weeks and then can change dogs or can save their game to play in forever mode."
2,Quite a Disapiontment,"I was excited to finally get the game of my dreams. Well, it's not any more! For starters, they don't have very good dog breeds. Only 18! Each day is around 5 min. long. Your day is like this : you get up, are FORCED to eat breakfast , are FORCED to go to school , and you are FORCED to eat dinner, The lines the parents say are ALWAYS the same and are TACKY!!!! A friend of mine agrees that the game is a rip-off! You only have the dog for 3 weeks, and the weeks go by quickly. PLEASE ! Take my advice. Don't buy this game. If I would have known , I wouldn't have bought it!!!!"
1,THIS SUCKS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,THIS GAME SUCKS!!!!!!!!!!!!!! PLEASE DONT GET THIS. YOUR WASTING YOUR TIME AND MONEY. YOU ONLY CAN PLAY FOR 3 WEEKS AND THEN YOUR PET DIES. TAKE MY ADVICE. DONT GET IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
4,COPY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"this game so copied off of nintendogs.It makes me angry!!!!I am sure it is a fun game put they are trying to copy nintendogs!but i am sure they made it for people who cant have a nintendo ds but still,it makes me mad.sure u can be an character and see yourself in it but in nintendogs,its a real person with the dog,YOU"
4,Dogz!!!!,"This game is so much fun! First, you have to pick out a dog. There are 18 adorable breeds. Then, your adventure begins. You have to train your dog, feed your dog, and so much more! This might sound like a lot of work, but in this game, work is fun. I think the Dogz for Nintendo DS is more fun, but I still think this game is fun too. Oh, and also, you have three weeks to do all of this stuff. Then, when your three weeks are over, you can put your puppy is always together mode. I love this game!"
1,Disappointed,"I guess my opinion of the book is an exception. The first chapter grabbed my attention, but as the chapters continued I felt let down. I wanted to hear how Dr. Snyderman personally overcame her obstacles, and not so much clinical advice. I felt Dr. Snyderman pulling away, afraid to reveal too much of the emotion she must have felt during those trying times, and hiding behind that clinical advice."
4,This book changed the way I think about myself,"I never thought I would say that about a ""self help"" book. I was hooked into the book because Dr Nancy was on the radio station(s) I work at and I met her. I was struck be what a nice, grounded decent person she is. I was ready to usher into the studio an egomaniac ready to put down Fort Wayne with a smile and plug a book. I couldn't have been more wrong. I went home, read the book in one sitting, and thought. And thought, and thought. Since then, I've gotten blood tests, gone on a diet, lost weight, and probably (according to my doctor) added some years to my life. If I knew how to get ahold of her, I would thank her. There is something for everyone in this book. The message that everyone has value at all times, not just when we are being successful comes through loud and clear."
5,Necessary Journeys- a book of courage.,A necessary read- and reread- for those who have made mistakes in life and need inspiration to recover and find fulfillment.
5,Necissary Journeys,"Having known Nancy, through working for her father, I always envied her beauty, poise and kindness, and of course her statis. My own mother seemed prouder of the fact that Nancy was from Fort Wayne, then she was of me being her own daughter.Being addicted to self-help books, and trying to make myself the best I could be. Nancy's book touched me in a way no other has. I always assumed she had, had a life of priviladge and ease. One without struggles or harsh desitions. I am at a crossroad in my own life and reading it has given me the confidence to step beyond, and look to the future with a bit more confidence, in the good things that my future may hold for me. It's helped me be less depressed and alone. Just knowing that everyone has problems to endure, even Nancy,has helped me focus beyond my prolems, to a solution and a good future.The book came into my life at just the right moment. Thank you Joy and Sue for telling me I HAD to read this book."
4,Buckwheat honey.,I had heard about buckwheat honey on Dr. Oz show and how good it is to keep cold and coughs away. The taste wasn't too bad. I tasted like a lighter molasses taste.
1,Not my cup of tea,My wife wanted to try this after seeing it highlighted on Dr. Oz as the best sugar alternative for hot drinks. We tried it in coffee and tea and the flavor was so strong it overpowered the flavor of the drink you were adding it to. No thank you Dr. Oz.
4,Pure and good.,I didn't realize the differences in honey until I did some research. This is my first 'pure honey' buy and there is certainly a difference in this and what I get at the grocery. Seems to have a 'richer' taste to it.
4,Good taste,bought for health reasons - supposedly a better natural sugar which is also nutritious.1 2 3 4 5 6
4,strong flavor,"Dutch Gold buckwheat honey - Try it on Toasted bread with maranatha sunflower butter , hmmmm.... This is a strong flavor - reminds me of molasses."
5,Really Good.....And Different,"I am a self confessed spice nut. I love owning and experiencing all kinds of spices in an attempt to create tjat absolutely perfect taste. As most people are aware, there are certain herbs and spices that are better suited for pork, than fish, or chicken than steak. This really robust blend of garlic and herbs from Tones is one of the most universal spices I have ever used. I regularly add it to pasta sauce, chicken, steak, hamburgers, roasts, pork, you name it and it tastes great on anything. One thing I can promise you is that it has a very different flavor to it than you have probably ever experienced from any other common spice, or blend in your kitchen. It's garlic taste is distinctive, but far from overwhelming. The herbs come through in its aroma, and more importantly, in the final product that you are using. This brand and blend is hard to find in stores in any size. I buy it here regularly on Amazon and highly recommend it for your own kitchen adventures..."
4,Informative and authoratative,"This book discusses most aspects of network design to an impressive level of detail. No fast answers are given as is appropriate for a design book. The author's approach is such that he immediately commands the readers respect and from what I have seen is only matched by Cormac Long's design book. The only gripe I might have is that I found the style a tad long-winded at times, since I personally prefer books to be as concise as possible."
4,Good companion if you like back-and-forth flipping,"This is a very attractive and comprehensive guide to the game, and very cheap considering the quality of the paper & images.My only complaint is that the order of the ""missions"" inside, which tend to be in no particular order concerning their placement. Missions that I encountered early on in the game I had to dig around into the back of the guide to find; and oftentimes the book would break up the mission depending on how many parts it entailed, rather than listing out the full specs of the mission in one convenient place.Other than that, I would recommend this book to anyone who owns the game. The price alone is an amazing bargain, and the helpful information - as well as directions towards hidden quests/items - is not only useful, but fun!"
4,Good to have,This is a prette decent book. Especially the initial part is helpful in getting started in the game and finding your way around. It provides a good overview of the different types of characters you can play and provides some guidance in possible ways of developing these characters and how to use the character's skills.The second part of the book is a plain walk through. This becomes a cheat-sheet more than anything else. You can probably find this on the Internet. I would have wished for more overall strategy.
5,love this game,"wish troika would have lived through the failure of this games launch. story was phenomenal, but technically the game was not sound. love you troika."
3,Not a true die cast!,"This taxi is a fun toy BUT, it is not a true die cast. Only the frame appears to be die cast, the rest is plastic. But unlike a model, the parts are all attached with screws which makes it more durable. Not for play just for looks!!!!"
3,Classic Doo Wop,"""A Thousand Miles Away"" is a classic doo wop hit, with its vocal refrain, ""Rat-a-tat""."
5,Illuminating,"I'm not Buddhist, but I am very politically active, and that's why I decided to check out this book. 2006 looks to be a year of changes, probably because the powerful have become disconnected from reality, and a group of people who have questioned the ""reality"" and dared to think in new ways are pushing forward. The essays in this book encourage the reader to question assumptions... especially the assumption that Buddhists are above politics. The last, best essay by Sam Harris poses the most subversive question: would getting rid of the religion of Buddhism make the world a better place?"
1,Very Disappointed,"For anyone who is trying to gain a clear understanding of the hadith as I was, do not bother buying this book. I have not even been able to make it through the whole book; it's just that bad. The author bring his own presuppositions to the text, rather than presenting it in a factual matter. This is definitely not a book for anyone looking for an introduction to the Hadith."
1,little in the way of understanding,"Normally, a serious work on Hadith (the sayings of the Prophet of Islam) entails detailed discussion on matters of the transmission of reports, authenticity and meaning. This book is devoid of any serious analysis of sources and merely quotes traditions in an ad hoc manner often seemingly in order to pass snide comments on aspects of Islamic belief and practice. One gets the distinct impression that the author (who had been a Hindu scholar) is simply expressing his distaste at Islam. It really is a dreadful book, utterly lacking in objectivity and academic rigour. You'll learn little of value from it. Do look elsewhere."
1,What is this?,"I recently purchased this book in order to gain a better understanding of my own religion. I noticed that the book was not written by a Muslim however I believed that this would not be an issue. This definately is an issue, trust me. Instead of making this book an unbiased analysis, the author is blatantly skeptical of Islam and tries to discredit it whenever he has the chance. He even goes so far as to point out what he believes are Islam's weaknesses and Hinduism's strengths. This book is entitled Understanding the Hadith, not A Comparison of Hinduism and Islam. Along with this , the style and writing is very repetitive and at times unclear. It was difficult for me but I finished reading the book and I now wonder why Ram Swarup even bothered to write it."
1,Anti-Islam Book,"This book is an anti-Islamic work. One can tell by just reading the couple of pages available to you. The author tries to say that Muhammad tried to say he was higher than God. Which is blasphemous and what the Prophet preached against. Muhammad was against putting up to Godly status and he said so as does the Qur'an. He was like the other Prophets, but a mortal human being."
2,Not as good as the others in the series,"I just finished listening to all the records in the Dub Me Crazy series and this has to be the worst one. All the songs sound flat and very upbeat and similar to one another, it simply did not sound good. I can tell that Neil Fraser did not spend that much time making this album good in comparison to the rest of the series. The best in the series probably are Part 2, 3, and 10. The rest are decent though too. Skip this one."
5,The world-class Hall of Fame supergroup of all time!,"The Flamingos are my all-time favorite group ever. Extraordinary harmonies, impeccable timing, and intricate arrangements characterize every beautiful recording by this amazing world-class group. The Flamingos have a unique and timeless sound which has often been emulated but never duplicated, and most likely never will. They have left an enduring legacy of music for millions of people to enjoy. May God bless them all!"
5,A nice collection from a classic Doo Wop group.,"The Flamingos have some of the sweetest and finest harmonies in Doo Wop. This CD proves it. ""I Only Have Eyes For You"" is a classic, but ""Golden Teardrops"" is also wonderful. Buy this CD and you will not be disappointed."
5,GREAT CD.,"A great CD of rock'n'roll, the songs are fantastic. Good sound. To the lovers of this music it is recommended to him"
3,Disappointing at best,The better songs are at the end.The first dozen or so are all flip side material.Somebody needs to mix a Flamingos meet the Moonglows.Then you would have enough good do wops for a useable CD.rgds..Clutch cargo
2,Only a few,"I obtained a loan of this album, and I'm certainly glad that I did not buy it. It has ""I Only Have Eyes for You"" but that's about the only great song on the album. Still, if that's the only manner in which you can get a copy of this version of that great song of the late 1950's, then go for it. That one cut is priceless. The other great Flamingos hit, ""Only You,"" is not on this album."
2,The Flamingos,"Unfortunatley, most of the songs are from the ""B"" side of their hits. There are some good tunes, but not enough familiar ones."
4,"nice quality watch, light and sturdy, but a bit small to me","I generally liked this watch. It has an aluminum case, so the watch is quite light. If you look at the face closely, it is not purely black, rather pearl dark grey in circles (which wasn't bad at all). Usual Swatch quality and long battery life. One thing I didn't like was the size - the watch's face was a bit small to my taste, but tastes differ."
2,too small,"The chain is really pretty, but it is way tooo skinny... the picture makes it look like a thick chain but it is really thin"
1,Poor Quality,I don't think this chain was even sterling silver. I was so embarassed when I gave it to my aunt as a gift with a s.s. cross on it. The cross stayed silver but the chain turned black! Never again will I spend a dime with this vendor! And I bought 2 of them!
1,Very Disappointed in Product,"The information on this product states that this item it will fit most RV's. Not so, not even close. There is no way to even motifiy this item to make it work. Was a total waste of money. I've had RV's for over 40+ years, and have never even seen a gutter even close to what this will fit. Not even worth sending back due to the shipping return charges being more that this product cost. Would not recommend this product to anyone. To bad you have even give it one star, in order to leave a review"
1,This will only fit if there is an end piece to clip it to,I believe there are few motor homes this will fit as it requires the end piece to snap it to. The picture shows the gutter end and the snap on extender in a lighter white but only the snap on extender is provided.
1,Gutter extensions,The extensions will not work on older rvs that do not have the newer style gutters. I have a 97 Coachman with gutters that do not turn out at the ends. I am sure they would work well on newer rvs but can not be modified to fit the older models.
5,Great addition to any Class A!,These are awesome gutter extensions and for the price you can't go wrong. I purchased them for our 2004 Tiffin Allegro Bay and they snaped right into the existing rain gutters. No more water on the side windows and I am pretty sure they will stay in place going down the highway. If not I have to extra because I didn't put the extensions on the back of the coach.
4,Gutter extenders,"These help with black streaks, but don't expect that they will be gone for good!These could of been another inch or two longer. Make sure your roof is clean! That is the real key to eliminating the black streaks."
3,Works but have reservations,"I added these to my RV a few years ago and they work just fine. The RV must be level or you will get drip marks on the ""high"" side (but that is your fault). My issue is related to two things. After a few years they dry out and will break off with a light touch. In addition, I just purchased an RV cover and these will poke a hole in it over the storage season. When you go to remove them, they will break. They do work however as long as they are in good shape. I am going back to the old clothespin trick! If you do not cover your RV, what the heck, try 4 and see how you feel!"
1,Could not finish it,"It tried, I really tried to finish this book. But about one third of the way through I just gave up and decided life was too short to waste on something so boring. I love history and I love mystery - but this failed to deliver."
3,average,"I actually read this book when it first came out. As soon as I started reading it on my Kindle, I remembered it and finished it again still liking it.The reason I'm giving it three stars is that in all the years since I originally read the book, I have never been moved to read another by the author. And now, having reread the work, still am not interested in reading anything else by this author.It's an average read. Nothing special, nothing awful."
3,Great fictional take on the SCA,"I grew up in the SCA, dragged to event after event (my first event was Pennsic 13!) by my father, who joined shortly after he divorced my mother. Twenty-one years later, he's still in the SCA and even serves on its Board of Directors.Although it's been more than fifteen years since I was an active SCA member, I do remember fondly some of the time I spent as an adolescent in the Society, and I read this book as a means to reminiscence. This little book is a terrific mystery yarn that is also a very accurate portrayal of the nuances of SCA society and culture. I don't know if a non-SCA person would want to read it, though---it might be too confusing. But to current and former SCA folk, this is a terrific read, and it also shows that SCA folk on whole are just ""regular people"" with a rather unusual hobby."
3,Level Lap,"Because I am short, my legs are not level when I sit in most chairs so, I could not keep the lap desk level either. It looks well made and works ok if I use a foot stool."
4,Bravo,I ordered this lap desk as a Christmas gift for my son and both he and I were very pleased with it. The wood is beautiful and it came exactly as described. I would purchase from this buyer again.
2,defective,Not very happy with the product being shipped with such obvious defects and damages. Might be a fairly decent product if it wasn't defective.
5,great item.,"light, handy, easy to carry and strong. great item. i have 2 of them for my boyfriend and for me."
4,Sturdy and functional,"We were looking for a lap desk to use with laptop computers at home. The classic wood lap desk is sturdy and functional. Surface and edge is smooth. The soft padding material below the lap desk does its job. Overall, happy with the purchase."
4,Looks Sharp,"I recently bought this product for my boyfriend and he loves it! His laptop gets extremely hot and when he puts it on his lap, it's ridiculous. After I bought this product for him, he can use his laptop much more often. We're off at college and because there's never enough space, we find ourselves working on the bed. After I got this, he can work longer without quickly becoming uncomfortable. And as an added bonus-- it looks great; the wood is very attractive! I've had no problems with the bean bag cushion underneath like some have, you just have to take care of the product. Essentially it's a piece of furniture, you're only responsibility is respecting it like you would anything else.It has a convenient little zipper for whatever (i.e. pens, pencils) It's also big enough to have a little bit of room for a mouse, which is a plus when you're tired of using the trackpad.Overall, I'm very happy with this."
1,crap quality,"I love the design of the desk, however, this one is horrible quality. After only one month of use, it is worn down and ugly. I reccomend they make thicker desks of a higher quality. Maybe leather instead of polyester. This is the second desk of this type I have bought."
2,nice but chipped,I purchased this for my father for his birthday and when I opened the box the edge of the desk was chipped. I was disappointed and I felt bad that it looked like it was used. Maybe it was just bad luck- the quality seemed to be ok.
4,great addition to the laptop,"I bought this after looking at numerous products(some even by the same company that makes this). I think the lip on the front is great as it keeps the computer from sliding off. Its solid and built well. I wouldn't take it to a war zone, but works great in a living room and bedroom.I would like to change a few things, but over all its awesome. Its a great buyI would change the bean-bag stuffing to a foam (prefer memory foam)I would like to see some type of cooling features for the laptop maybe usb powered or a/c"
3,0,"This package from Encore Software comes with 4 CDs for the education and entertainment of young children. I purchased this for my 5 year-old daughter. All the games are fairly simple and probably appropriate, with the possible exception of ""Grammar Rock,"" for the indicated age group (i.e. 1st & 2nd grade). HOWEVER, there are definite problems that must be mentioned. The Muppets Thinking Skills is entertaining and does indeed help with said skills, BUT the game is the SAME every time through; there is no way to change the game every time it is played. Every puzzle or question is repeated in exactly the same way, thereby promoting memory skills rather than original thinking...."
4,good old time action movie.,Unlike some of the reviews--my copy was very good. I found it to be an enjoyable escape--and how could an escape with Anita Ekberg not be a good thing?
2,Beware!,"The dvd I saw seems to be authored from an old master for a laserdisc or maybe even a VHS tape! It starts out in full scope ratio (although not anamorphic) but when the titles end, back to 1.33 pan and scan we go! Additionally, the Columbia pictures logo is missing. Amazon doesn't mention what the aspect ratio is supposed to be so you kind of assume it will be the native ratio for the film. Especially when the cover art screames ""CINEMASCOPE!!!!"" in letters as big as the stars names. The big attraction here, aside from Ms. Eckberg, is a big screen experience with lots of battle scenes which you will see squeezed and cropped. No excuse for this sort of thing these days. It's not 1980 anymore."
3,gambled,"I really took a gamble with this album and it paid off in a way. The songs and the mood of the CD is good. The only deficit I have to mention is that the sound quality of a few of the songs was not impressive. Sound was hollow, tinny, slightly garbled. If you can get around that, it is good worship. I can't so I skip the few songs that annoy.Peace"
3,Not Exactly Up In Smoke,"Despite having synthesizers and tense strings in tow, Badalamenti gives a unique finish to what would otherwise be an example of modern day's conventional scoring technique. Flute solos and subtle splashes of cymbal crashes and timpani rolls, along with allusions to melodies that never quite make it, bring interest to the melodrama. It is not much, a little slight. What most catches my ear is the infectious 'Maya, Mayi, Ma' song, an unashamed take on 'world music'."
3,Daybreak: Fainne an Lae,"I went to a Danu performance in Portland, ME that included this young lady. She was great live. She was not so great on the CD."
5,One of the best out there.,"This is an excellent book for those struggling with infertility or miscarriages. It is also a good one to read for those who want to understand what others may be going through. It is well written, in a way that holds the interest of the reader, with short stories woven in here and there. I have found this to be my favorite as a gift for friends who are struggling with issues we struggled with at one time."
3,Hmm....,"*Notice* I read this book approximately one year ago. I do not plan to read it again. The following are my impressions... While I think this book does a good job of capturing the various feelings associated with infertility - I have to say that I was disappointed and even depressed at the conclusion. In one or two sections, I think the author does a good job of empowering women to regain their strength, self worth and focus. However, although the presentation of differing ways to handle infertility were informative, I do not recommend this book for someone who is just starting out on the infertility trail or for anyone who is already on the brink of losing hope. This book will take you right over the edge."
2,WARNING: Only for Fundamentalist Christians,"I really wish I had known this book was written about and for fundamentalist Christians-then I never would have bought it. Non-fundamentalist Christians might be put off by the Bible-thumping people portrayed in this collection of couples' accounts of their struggles with infertility. I know I was! When several women described tears making their mascara run while at church activities, images of Tammy Faye Bakker kept flashing before my eyes.This book was certainly written with the best intentions, and the people portrayed are very honest and loving (as much as you can be when you believe that all non-fundamentalist Christians, abortionists, Planned Parenthood, homosexuals, etc. will burn in hell for all eternity).Many people will certainly feel more at peace with their infertility after reading this book, and I do believe that knowing you're not alone makes all the difference.That's why I'm giving it 2 stars."
5,Works well,Good value. Really helps organize paperwork. Arrived on time. Nothing else to say about it. This is my second order for these.
4,Awesome products! Good for college student.,I use this product for my classes in college and they help me keep all my notes from class organized. I highly recommend them to anyone who does not like to use conventional notebooks for note-taking.
4,Lots of Fun,"This games is a lot of fun. The charting map is a cool feature and the graphics of your hunting area are awesome. There's also a nice variety of guns and calls. The only downside is I wish there were more animals. But even with the 5 or so animals it has (bears, elk, moose, bighorn sheep, caribou i think) it's still a lot of fun. Definitely worth buying."
2,OK,"The Map Edit feature was great but most of the time the game would crash right in the middle of a hunt. At first it was a blast, then it was downhill from there."
3,Used for class but also applicable to real world situations,I had to get this book for a class years ago and find myself referring to it time and agian because of it's usefull tips on how to address challenges in the work place.
3,"Tetra 19117 Water Wonders Fresh Water Plant Cabomba, 9-Inch","This plant is as advertised. looks just like the picture. Dark green, base is a v shaped clear plastic about three inches long. Good product."
3,OK but not as pictured,The item is not as green as shown and is held down by cheap thin and narrow plastic that can not hold enough gravel or sand to weigh it down. I wish I would have passed on this stuff and purchased something that looked a bit more realistic. this just looks like cheap faux plants floating in my tank (floating because I am tired of putting my arm in 20 in of fish water to re-bury them!)
3,Soft Grip Suit Hanger (Set of 8),"Great product and it really does save space in your closet! It's unfortunate, however, that the shipping/handling was far more than the cost of 10 sets. The black hangers can be found at some Costco and other retail stores. It may cost more but you'll save, in the long run, without the shipping and handling! The item gets 5 stars but the shipping erased 2 stars."
3,Just OK...,"In all honesty, this story can barely compare to other mangas of similar storyline. This series can barely hold a candle against Ah! My Goddess or Ceres, just to name a few. I don't see how the sad portion of the ending makes any sense to anyone, *spoilers* the guy is only 28... *end spoilers* I just didn't feel myself make any emotional connection with any of the characters and that their potential could have been much greater. The love between a devil and an angel, the love between the two main characters, and even the development of the secondary characters all could have been much more expanded on. Conclusively, this series falls short in comparison to both CLAMP's work and other similar series."
5,The best Pajama Party ever,"As a person who doesn't know how to sew, this DVD is a great learning tool. I was able to make myself some killer pajamas and now I make them and give them to my friends as birthday presents. You can have fun while you learn and you can enjoy what your learned every time you go to bed and put on your new super cool PJ's. I HIGHLY recommend this DVD for any beginner or expert sewer who is looking to make some cool pajamas and have a good time."
5,Hello kitty bedding,I recieved the Hello Kitty bedding just few hours ago . It is so soft and good quality . The colors are so pretty and the fabric is so soft . I got the set as a gift for my sister in law as a gift ( though she won't tell us the gender of the baby )She is a BIG hello kitty fan . I think she will use the set for herself before the baby is born hehehe . Good thing i got one before they are outta stock .
3,"Entertaining, but nothing to write home about","This book moves quickly, and gave me the feel that it would make a good screenplay for a bubble-gum film that you'd see once. I never got to know or like any of the characters. They all seem incredibly self-absorbed; lost in their own eccentricities. I got the feeling that that was supposed to endear them to me, but I found it just too much drama. Then suddenly they all just drop everything to help each other out in the end? I would regard this book as wacky fun: suitable if you just want a light diversion. The whole idea of 'sending your child away to be homeschooled' is a tad annoying. Along with the 'ignore your kids and they'll carve out their own creative path' philosophy. But I am willing to suspend a bit of disbelief for a book, which is why I'd still give it an endorsement, with caveats."
5,Jesse's review,Surviving the Applewhites is a pretty cool book.Jake is my favorite character. I like his hair and his necklace and his eyebrow ring.When Jake went to get the butterfly for E.D that is like me because I would do that for a nice person too.It makes me sad for Jake because he isn't with his parents. It makes me think about when I am bad in school.Teenage boys would like this book better than girls.I like the beginning when he first got to the farm and starts to know people.When it's E.D's turn it gets boring.I would read this book again but I want to read another very good book like the first one.
3,"Interesting, but not the best book ever","This book was okay. It was good enough that I got the message from it, but I didn't think it was as good as I though it would be. It got kind of boring at parts. If you absoloutly cannot find anything else to read, pick up this book, but if you can find something better, read that instead."
3,Survivfing the Applewhites,"This book is filled with humor, drama, annoying little four-year-olds, and evil goats that smell as evil as they look. I recommend this book to people who like funny protagonists who use fingerpaints to color their hair. This book is filled with conflict with in the family and the community. It's a must read!!(...)"
3,Mrs.Brown's 4 th grade class,This story is based on a boy named Jake and how a family takes him in. Because Jake has been cursing and smoking it will be really hard to make him apart of the family. This story is also about a girl named E.D. and how she finds that she fits in with her family. To me this story gets boring but I think some kids will like it. I'm just really picky about the books I enjoy. I would recommmend this book to 3rd and 4th graders.
3,Exciting,"The book Surviving the Applewhites is a good book. If you like exciting and fun books you will like this one. Jake Semple is a really cool character. This book is mainly about Jake. Jake has got kicked out of every school in his state. There is one place left to except him, and that is the Applewhites. They are a bunch of weird, funny, and exciting people. This is the only chance left for Jake to have a school, will it work, will Jake survive those people. Read this good book and you will find out."
4,Soooo much fun!,"This story about a dilinquient kid and the nutty family that take him in is all fun. The characters are wonderfull, and I fell head-over-heels in love with E.D., Destiney, and Jake. The only problem with this book is that it is too short!and a note to all other drama nerds- you will particularley enjoy the production of the Sound of Music which is the center of the novel."
4,"BURN BABY, BURN",Although a 12-year-old girl I can totally relate to Jake. When he gets put in the artistic familly who are anything but similer to him he has to play it tough. Let his old school burn baby burn because if Jake didn't set it on fire we would never have been able to read this amazing story.
4,"Humor, with a human side","This is a good hearted book that follows the transformation of Jake, incipient hoodlum, to Jake, possible actor/singer in a believable gradual series of extenuating circumstances. The humor rests on the interesting and very individualistic ways the various residents of the Creative Academy go about their daily lives, making Jake, with his spiked hair and many earrings seem almost normal.A sub-plot also follows E.D., one of the daughters of the family in her quest to organize her life and NOT be as hair-brained as the rest of her family. She, too, discovers that her talents are valued, even if they are not in the artistic domain."
4,Surviving the Applewhites,"Surviving the Applewhites is about a kid named Jake Semple. People say that Jake burned down his old school and then was kicked out of every other school in his home state.A few weeks into September, the middle school in Traybridge, North Carolina has throw him out too.Now there's only one place left that will take him. A home school run by the most outrageous, chaotic, forgetful family you will ever meet!By: Ryon"
3,10 year old boy's review,"He liked it, but loves spy novels best. Mom really liked it better than he did! It is a good story for teenage kids."
4,"Slow beginning, Great ending","I thought that the book was very well written. Although the plot went a little off topic at times, it still had a great story to tell. It was a story about changing from who you aren't to who you really are. Simple ending but very effective. I would recommend this to a person who enjoys character change during a story."
4,Surviving the Applewhites,This was part of a three book selection as part of a summer reading program for my son. He liked this book the best of the three.
4,Surviving the Applewhites,"A boy named Jake Semple goes to North Carolina because he is kicked out of all the school in Rhode Island. There, he starts to change. He stops smoking, he stops trying to get people to notice that he is in charge, and he takes a part in a play called The Sound of Music."
2,Surviving the Applewhites,"What would you be like if your name was Semple, close to simple? Do you think life would be simple, and easy? That's not true for a young man named Jake Semple, the star of ""Surviving the Applewhites"" by Stephanie Tolan. He's a bad boy with a criminal record a mile long. Legend has it that he burned down his old school in his home state of Rhode Island.Well, he is sent to go live with the Applewhites because no one in his family wants to care for him or live with him. So he goes and lives with the Applewhites and is home schooled by them. Will he become good? This is a question that is asked through out the book. You must read it to find out!In my opinion, I think this book was very good. The ending was very surprising, but the rest wasn't good. It wasn't the worst book I've read, but it wasn't the best. It was right in between. I don't recommend this book to any one that does not want to read it. If you like a surprising ending, then this book may be good for you."
2,I guess it was alright,"I read Surviving The Applewhites for the CYRM voting and I thought that it had a clear point but was very hard to finish because it is pretty boring. I didn't want to read this story in the first place because I couldn't stand looking at the cover, but I finally got over it and read the first chapter. I put it down immediatly once I saw that it talked about Jake Semple smoking and his parents growing a drug. I don't think that the drug parts are nessasary. Don't waste your time reading this book."
3,Surviving The Applewhites,I think Surviving The Applewhites was a good book becausewhen I was reading the book I would want to keap reding sothat I could see if Jakeas would burn down the school or getin trouble again or to see if he would learn his leason orstart to be a good kid. The thing I wondered all the timewas how Jake got the tools to light stuff on fire.
5,wonder of wonders,"Like a gift from God, this wonderful product performs miracles when faced with the dilemma of having to connect two disparate midi devices together. An unimaginable delight. And so cost effective!"
5,Hosa MIDI cable,"I have bought many Hosa cables in the past and I have to say they are very good. Well made, sturdy connectors. I have yet to be disappointed by a Hosa product. The good thing about Hosa cables is that they seem to have every combination of end connectors I need, as well as the lenghts I need them in. And the price is great."
2,Flued Countersinks,"An OK product, the only bit I have used so far was bent as received. Kit does not include a stop collar to control countersink depth."
2,VERY dissapointed,"If version 6.0 of MediaStudio Pro is any good, I'll never know. It's very buggy and works about half the time. Worst of all, their customer service department has not responded to any of my email asking for help. Too much money for something that's not ready for prime time. To bad because it has some nice features."
1,Not a finished product,"Ulead has very bad support. The editing program is good enough now that they have release the patch.I have been wasting a lot of time with the capture program that on my machine at least has problems capturing sound. I may or may not get a fix, but if I could find another program to use with my ADS PYRO card I would use it."
3,Lovely,"A deeper look into the lives and personal styles of the subjects, but what I really wanted were inspirations for my own home. More pictures please!"
5,Oh Yeah,"This is a beautiful book that reflects an African American aesthetic. I only wish that there were examples of stylish homes outside of New York. Atlanta, New Orleans, Boston, San Francisco, and many other cities exhibit some amazing mansions, beautifully appointed."
4,A must for Decorating Collectors,"Style and Grace: African Americans at Home is a must for anyone that is an avid collector of diverse Interior Decorating styles. Even if you are just interested in designs for creating African interiors, or decorating styles of the artistic and eclectic, this is the one book to add to your collection. African objects mixed with art deco, classical, traditional and modern styles. The Exotic and Rustic to the Modern and Streamlined are showcased-all are a mixture of what we strive to achieve in our own homes.The rooms in this book are actual, lived in rooms of everyday homes. Nothing seems staged or fussy. Masculine or Feminine...I found all these interiors very culturally urban. Comfortable, inspirational, unique and beautiful!"
4,I really enjoyed this cd,I really enjoyed this cd which was a birthday present from my family its had some of my all time favriot hymns such as just a closer walk with thee and how great thou art and especially nearer my God to thee. i also liked bridge of troubled water and the others.
5,Love it!,My favorite to listen to when I need to be lifted up!! Has my Grandma's and Grandpa's favorite hymns! I have always loved Anne Murray!!
5,Yes Amen,Thats what I am talking about lots of awesome Gospel music i love it i really like this music that gets you into the presence of God it puts you the mind set for praise and worship you think about the many blessings and the goodness of God has done in your life thank you Amen Praise His Holy Name
2,Okay... Not Quite What I Was Expecting...,"Not quite what I was expecting from Anne Murray, but okay. There is a somewhat odd song selection and flow to the song arrangement and often, Anne's voice isn't used to it's best advantage. Her voice may not be what it used to be, which is understandable, but on this CD, it seems unusually strained and harsh, which makes it a little hard to listen to. I do listen to this occasionally, but, unlike others I have, not usually more than once at a time. Also, I thought it was seriously overpriced. I love Anne Murray, but I'm not sure I'd buy this CD again..."
2,Odd mixture and straining voice,"The songs are ok; however, the mixture of the songs leaves much to be desired. The hymns were nice, but the modern songs with a cheezy easy listening elevator sound was terrible. For example, ""put a little love in your heart"" tucked between ""whispering hope"" and ""how great thou art""?! Bleh.Perhaps if one disk was easy listening and the other was inspiriational traditional hymns. I could have enjoyed the one and then the other.I tried to take into account her age, as we age the voice ages as well, Ann Murray does strain to hit notes and that comes through. Perhaps she should make more effort to tailor the songs to her current range.Over all I can't recommend it. I am glad I checked the CD out of the library first. It horrifies me that the local library paid 20+ dollars on this CD."
1,Very disappointing,"Listening to this album invokes a deep sadness in me because I feel I have wasted my hard-earned money on it. Why does her voice sound so stiff and harsh in this album ? Each song sounds like a windlass with an enormous load at work; the song ends when the heavy load gets hauled in, at which moment I feel like I could breath out in relief. Instead of getting my spirit up, this album drags me way down. I'm glad there are people out there who like it, because I'll have to find a buyer for my copy."
5,Outstanding rendition of 'A Closer Walk With Thee',"I bought this digital album solely for the purpose of gaining possession of the old classic 'A Closer Walk With Thee.' Anne does an outstanding job with this rendition. This timeless song has been performed by many, but Pete Fountain's instrumental and Anne Murray's vocal recordings are at the very TOP! Her background musicians + the inclusion of 'Take My Hand' gives a special professional touch to this famous song. Anne also does an excellent job with the remaining 25 classics that she sings. I, therefore, give this album my wholehearted A+ recommendation! Ken Lyons"
4,what a wonderful world,Very prompt and in good shape....Gave to a lady who just lost her husband. They grew old together and took care of small dogs for a little extra money. Hope it helps her through the sadness.
5,Very Pleased,I was very satisfied with this CD. It was in perfect shape and I have enjoyed listening to it very much since I recieved. Thanks!
5,Wonderful Classic Hymns,Anne Murray has done a wonderful job of recording some of the most beloved hymns of all time. Listening to these brings you closer to your faith and spirit.
5,Fly Me to Polaris,"This absolutely the most compelling, well wriiten, perfectly acted,and masterfully produced motion picture I have ever viewed...even though it was subtitled in English, the storyline is overwhelming. I originally viewed it on YouTube quite by accident and was so overcome by the entire production...I did a search and found it was available on Amazon...I immediately ordered it and upon arrival, watched it three more times! The DVD version, obviously, is far superior to YouTube's...the price was reasonable (I would have paid twice the price to get it!)...and delivery was the normal excellent service from Amazon. I'm a 65 year old tough retired cop and firefighter, I'm not susposed to be attracted to this movie genre...I dare you to watch it without sheading a tear...I don't care how macho you are!Fly Me To Polaris"
1,"Ms. Hargrove has a ""flair for the obvious.""","After almost every observation made by Hargrove in this work, I felt the need to let out a resounding cry of ""DUH!!!"" (not ""DA"" as the poet instructs)."
4,A good show at a good price.,"This is a nice, three episode DVD of the show C.O.P.S. This was one of my favorite shows as a kid. Though the DVD is good, this show deserves a complete collection."
3,C.O.P.S.,"Central Orginization for Police Specialists, fighting crime in a future time. Protecting empire city against big boss and his evil gang of thugs.These are the C.O.P.S.Written by the comic book writer Dough Monech these T.V. episodes are based loosely on his dark comics with the same name. This DVD has roughly three episodes. The DVD transfer is good but I'm becoming increasingly spoiled by season releases instead of episode releases. Anyway since no other episodes are on the market, legally, this is the best we can get.It's crime fighting time:David C. Eberhart II"
4,Essential Teachings of Zen Master Hakuin,"This is an excellent and compelling work. Hakuin's teachings are well represented and this is an excellent source for those interested in deepening their ""intellectual"" understanding of Buddhism."
3,Tiny Time Display,The time display is hard to see in daylight and impossible to see in the dark. Seiko should recalll these watches - freight paid - and replace the hands on the time display with some that can be seen in the daylight and dark. I like style as much as the next person but function should not be sacrificed for style.
2,Dont buy,"While the style of the necklace was nice the quality of the silver is poor, very poor and not marked as being silver either which makes me wonder if its silver at all"
3,Nice but flea market would have been cheaper.,"Although I like the design of this necklace, I found that the quality of sterling silver is very poor."
2,Rosary vs. Necklace,"A rosary and a necklace are NOT the same thing. It is disrespectful to wear a rosary as a necklace. Rosaries should only be worn on the belt or around the wrist to keep it close for praying, NOT as an ornament. If you are Catholic and you wear it, you should know better and if you are not and you wear it, you should know it sends the wrong message and is offensive. Crosses or crucifixes may be worn around the neck, however, so if you're looking for something to wear it's not this product."
5,awesome gift,"just received the neckalace and was suprised of how much i enjoyed it. thougth that it was ganna be cheap looking, far from it..will highly recommend it to anybody"
4,Flapper,exactly what we were looking for. Difficult to find locally this part repaired a water leak in our toilet. Thanks for the prompt shipment
2,Not worthwhile,"This insole does provide some minimal amount of cushioning. However, it's not worth buying -- better to pony up a few bucks more and buy one of the synthetic athletic insoles, which have much better cushioning and offer some support."
1,"A for effort, F for results","This is a very bad CD. I have been listening to Ronnie Dio for over 25 years and this disc does nothing to honor one of the greatest, if not, the greatest hard rock singer of all time. The problem, no one here can SING! Ronnie can SING! You know, pitch, meledy, phrasing...etc. The artist's, who I had never even heard of, fail badly in attempting to perform these rock classics. Sure the set list is great, but the performances are awful! Those ""death metal"" bands stand against everything Dio was as a musician. Take my advise...leave this disc alone! It is really bad. If you want to honor Dio, put on Rainbow Rising and enjoy the master!"
4,Great work!,"I found this CD in the Greek Metal Hammer Magazine and I must admit that I was impressed by the work,the bands have done in Dio's greatest hits.Buy it!You won't regret it."
2,"To avoid anger, buy USED.",I spent a $1.79 + shipping and I still feel kind of robbed. There's two problems. Most of the singing doesn't live up to what you're use to as a Dio fan. Of course I admit those are some big shoes to fill. And some of the tracks are obviously not the from most professional recordings. I'm waiting on Holy Dio - A Tribute To the Voice Of Metal. Hopefully it's better.
5,SIMPLY INCREDIBLE!!,"I HAVE BEEN A HUGE ''DIO '' FAN FOR YEARS, AND THIS CD DOES HIM JUSTICE!! EVERY SONG ROCKS - AND SOME BAND'S RENDITIONS ARE VERY INTERESTING AND DIFFERENT...ALL THE SONGS ROCK TOTALLY!! YOU ARE NOT LEFT DISAPPOINTED ,CAUSE ONLY A FEW SONGS WERE GOOD.IF YOU WANT THE DEFINITIVE '' DIO '' TRIBUTE ALBUM- THEN PICK UP THIS BAD BOY TODAY!! YOU WON'T BE DISAPPOINTED.EVEN IF YOU AREN'T A DIEHARD '' DIO '' FAN - THIS CD WILL MAKE YOU ONE..."
4,Pretty Helpful,"I got some good tips from the book. It helped me get familar with the layout of the area. In short, the top things I learned from the book were:1) At the Puerto Vallarta airport keep your head down and don't talk to anyone. They're all trying to sell you something.2) Use the pedestrian walk to cross over the highway and get a cheaper cab than from the airport. (We bargained and got a $13 USD ride to Nuevo Vallarta)3) Vallarta Adventures is a reputable tour group in the area. We booked all our tours through them in advance on their website. www.vallarta-adventures.com"
1,"PENNY JORDAN IS A HIT OR MISS AUTHOR, THIS WAS A MISS","I HAVE READ A LOT OF PENNY JORDANS WORK. I SEEM TO HAVE A LOVE HATE RELATIONSHIP CONCERNING HER WRITING. UNFORTUNATELY I CAN'T THINK OF A GOOD THING TO SAY ABOUT THIS BOOK. THE SO CALLED HEROINE WAS A REPORTER THAT JUMPED TO CONCLUSIONS WITHOUT ANY FACTS TO BACK UP HER ASSUMPTIONS?? THIS BOOK WAS VERY SILLY. I FOUND MYSELF NOT REALLY LIKING EITHER ONE OF THE MAIN CHARACTERS... I SUGGEST THAT YOU READ ""BEST MAN TO WED"" THAT IS MY FAVORITE PENNY JORDAN BOOK!!"
4,Good value and works well,"This is a pretty nice cable. It's very cheap for the quality of signal it passes. The lining looks nice, but frays easily - more easily than other wrapped cables I've had. Because of the long, rigid plastic/rubber end of the cable, this is more suitable for an instrument with a front jack plate. It won't be usable for bottom-mount if you want to be able to sit down and play.Overall, I'm very happy with this purchase."
3,Good product for the money.,"This is a good guitar cord but, you get what you pay for. I have also bought the a Monster cord and must say it's considerably better. Better bass response and clarity. However, it does cost more. I love the tweed look but I wish I could get the same in a Monster guitar cord."
1,piece of junk,Bought this cable from Amazon and after two days it complitely stoped working.Verified with other cable and it was no problem at all.Very disappointed.Thumbs down on this Fender vintage volt tweed 10 ft cable.
5,works like a charm,This is so much better than the ones they sell at Home Cheapo that my co-workers have. I would buy this a hundred times over!
1,falls apart,I wanted to use this as a hide in our outdoor run for small tortoises. The first one shattered when we picked it up after just a week. I assumed it was just a manufacturing defect. Amazon quickly replaced it. We've had the second one for about a month and now I'm seeing substantial cracks in it too so it's only a matter of time. It isn't like it's had to stand up to severe elements in 65-80 degree San Diego weather w/ no rain and occasionally watering with a garden hose. I wouldn't recommend this product.
2,Turtle Hut,Recieved very quickly and as described but has already fallen apart. Top part of hut caved in. Thought it was a great price but not worth it cause it didn't last.
3,Works well for a little while,"I bought this for my turtles to have somewhere to hide, and i couldn't find anything that would sink and not get the tank dirty. This did well for a couple months but i started to notice small pieces falling off. I thought the turtles where tring to eat it, but it turns out that if it is in the water for a couple months the plastic becomes very soft and starts to crumble. I had to remove it because i was worried about the turtles eating it. I imagine this would be no problem for dry habitats."
1,TERRIBLE..MITES,"I got this turtle hut, lightly cleaned it out and within two days I had mites all over. It took about 2 full days to clean and bleach everything out to get rid of them, would not recommend ordering from this company."
5,great,"just wonderful. It really flings, but not too far for a 10 lb. dog to get over there and nab it."
5,Easy and Clean,"This is such a great product...prior to this I was throwing softballs for my highly energetic dog and clearly, I couldn't get it far enough for him. And, needless to say, I was HIGHLY reluctant to pick it up after a few throws as it was just too slimy and slippery with his saliva. I love the ease of this product, the cleanliness and the distance I can get out of it, when throwing for my dog."
5,A must have for all active dog owners!,"I love playing with my dogs, but lets face it... my arm gets super tired after a little while. This item is a real life saver! You can effortlessly throw the ball HUNDREDS of feet! I will be purchasing one for each dog owner in my family."
4,Chuckit ball thrower,"This is a great thing to use to play ball with your dog and I highly recommend it. I gave it only 4 stars because I have a toy poodle who is an avid ball retreiver but her mouth is so small that she drops the regular chuckit ball several times before she gets back with it. It's painful to watch her struggle but she is so determined. This is her most favorite thing to do. I have stopped using the chuckit but wish they had a small one for the XS Kong tennis ball, which is her favorite and fits her mouth perfect. I also have a miniature poodle, whose not into retrieving a ball, but the ball for the regular chuckit is the perfect size for him. It's a great product for anything over a small toy dog and has many benefits to playing ball with a larger dog. So hey chuckit, how about making a small one for those little toy dogs."
3,Range not as long..,Slightly disappointed with the short range this throws the ball. I purchased to use with my golden retriever and wasn't much of a challenge for him because it didn't launch the ball far enough. I've used the standard size chuckers in the past and they have much better range. This one might be better suited for a small dog where long distance isn't the priority.
1,already broken?,didn't last 10 minutes so if you are okay with throw away purchasers this is the product for you to buy
3,Awesome Product but Read the Description Carefully!,"First Warning: Though the picture shows three chuck-its, you really only get one chuckit and one ball.I bought these as a Christmas present, so I don't know how durable they are but my family has one for our dog (smaller version) and it's super cool. We love it, though Tumbles often forgets to bring it back."
5,Awesome with cushy handle!,"I like this ball launcher much better than the original ChuckIt!. The handle makes throwing the ball much more enjoyable because it does not hurt your hand and allows you to throw the ball even further. If you've got a ball obsessed dog, this is a must have."
5,Addicted to Chuck It,I was introduced to Chuck It through a client. I now carry one with me at all dog visits. It saves my arm lots of wear and flings the ball far. GREAT PRODUCT!!
2,Ball not as advertised,"I am disappointed with this product. I was expecting the rubber ball that is easy to wash off as is advertised in this description, but got the regular orange tennis ball.It's not worth it to return it, but the product I received is worth less than what they charge. Buyer beware."
4,Chuckit works,Lets me throw the ball a lot further than I can with my arm. Got the small one which fits in my pocket. Keeps my hands clean.
1,Junk,I bought this for my new dog who is crazy for fetching. The ball came apartthe first day!!!. It isn't really a ball at all but two halves held togetherby the fuzz on the outside. This piece of junk doesn't deserve one star butthe basic concept of not having to pick it up with your hands is great.
5,Great!!,Easily fits in my pocket and is wonderful for getting my chubby dogs some exercise. I'm very happy that I picked the smaller version. I slip it into my pocket while we're walking down to the park and it is quite comfortable to carry along with me.
3,Dog Toy,Was smaller than expected but that was my fault for not researching it enough.Blah Bla Bla Bla Blah La La
3,LOVE CHUCK ITS but the small pocket launcher doesn't go far enough for us.,"Our border collies love to run hard, fast, and far - thought I was getting a regular size small chuck it - but tried the pocket size anyway. Don't use it much because I can't throw very far for our dogs. Will hold onto it in the car in case I need it for other family's dogs."
4,good product,"Really happy with this product, my arm was getting tired of throwing the tennis ball far enough to get my dog some exercise. would definitely recommend it. but don't let the dog get the plastic handle... it's not durable to chewing !"
5,Love the launcher,This little launcher is great for dogs fetching in the backyard. Just don't leave it where the pup can get it unsupervised... apparently they taste good. Ha!
3,Inaccurate Product Description,"Chuckit! Ultra Grip Ball Launcher (Colors Vary)I thought that this Chuck-it! would be shipped with the ultra ball instead of the cheaper ball which others have complained doesn't last long. The ""Ultra"" in the title refers only to the better cushioned handle; there is no ultra Chuckit ball included. Additionally, I ordered what I expected to be a regular sized Chuckit! but was sent an item labeled "" Chuckit! Ultra Grip Ball Launcher Medium/Moyen ""(great marketing move for Canadians, eh?). I was expecting the regular size/ larger size I've seen at dog parks and stores. I'll deal with the disappointment, rather than the return hassle, but in the future will be wary of the possible inaccuracy of product descriptions on Amazon."
3,I love these things!,I love these things. They keep your hands from being covered with dirt and saliva (especially when using those nasty dog park balls). I give this one three stars because the handle is a lot shorter than many others I have seen since buying this one. That means I have to bend over farther to reach the balls.
1,Chuckit Pocket Ball thrower,"I had a cheaper version than this one and would like another cheaper version! This one is shaped oddly so when you throw it it goes straight for the ground instead of up and far away! I won't buy another one, for sure. Believe me....I live on a pond with a black lab, I know how to throw !"
4,Chuck It Launcher,"The Dog loves it and the exercise is great! Works Great, but the ball it comes with cracks immediately.Would be better if it came with the ""Ultra Ball""."
4,Nice game,"Well, Tiger is a great game. Nice graphics, commentary, gamepalay is not bad, the only thing I didn't like was the fact that to make a swing you have to use the joystick, and it is rather difficult (to do it just right) with the joystick being so small on the PSP. So I guess it's more on SONY than on EA Sports. Great game overall"
4,Hmm....,"Well, what can I say? I am a huge fan of the Tiger Woods series, and have wasted many a moment either playing it on my own or battling in a round of skins with friends on my XBox. This was the third game that I picked up for the PSP after it came out, as I knew very well I had to own it. It doesn't quite match up to playing PGA Tour 2005 on console, but it does a pretty good job considering. My main issues with this was that the load times a pretty horrendous. I was ready to throw the thing after the first time I played just because I got tired of waiting. This is why I lowered my 'fun' rating to 3 stars. Otherwise, it is still very entertaining. It took me a little while to get used to it, but once I was it didn't seem as bad....but it sucks that I had to get used to it to begin with. Anyway, if you liked the console games of this series, you will definitely enjoy this.....waste time playing golf anywhere you go!"
5,Big Insights in a Little Package,"This short book is definitely Kung's most accessible treatment of the essentials of the Christian faith. Written specifically for the average layperson, yet lucid enough to engross any serious theologian, Kung presents the basic theological program which is the essence of his much grander works such as ""On Being a Christian"" and ""The Church."" In a nutshell, Kung, like Luther before him, calls for constant renewal of the Christian Church in the name of the man who is its source and criterion: Jesus Christ Himself."
2,Poorly designed,"My Oster 6803 worked well for about 6 months, then it started making strange noises while blending, something like a rattle.Within 2 weeks it started to leak from the twist on base. I noticed that the base had cracked.Thinking that it was somehow my fault, I bought another base. But as soon as I started to use it, the same noise began.I took it back and they sent a replacement (6 weeks wait).The new one is doing the same thing. I think the motor alignment is faulty.I will not buy another."
1,Very expensive parts,"We bought this blender a few years ago and this week the ""bottom cap"" cracked and became unusable. The good news is that we could purchase a replacement from Oster for $6 at [...]The bad news was that shipping for that 3oz cap is $10, for a total of $16 which is almost 1/2 the price of a new blender. I'll avoid Oster in the future."
1,Oster 6803 Blender,"I have had a couple of wonderful Oster blenders over the past 50 years, but this newest one is a piece of crap. The base of the jar does not fit properly on the main unit. The jar will not lock firmly on the base unit which creates a wobble. I have taken it apart several times and the same result...junk!"
4,"reliable blender, wish glass container was more stable on counter","We got this blender because we needed to be able to blend small amount of liquid. Nothing we owned seemed to be able to do this. The Oster totally does what we need. The only thing I do not love is that the blender is a little scary off the blender body. It seems very tippy, and I except one day we'll have a big spill."
1,Broken in 3 days!,"I purchased this blender on Saturday so that I could make smoothies in the mornings for breakfast. I used it Monday and Tuesday. This morning when I put all my goodies in the blender (nothing unmanageable - almond milk, yogurt, blueberries, kale, and frozen pineapple pieces) the blender started to blend but then smoke started billowing out from the motor! I will be returning this today!"
3,it works just fine,i do not use this often and when i do it is for simple things. i have used this twice since purchasing it and have been satisfied with it function and ability. the product arrived on time and in good condition.
5,EXCELLENT SERVICE,"MERCHANDISE WAS JUST WHAT I EXPECTED,ARRIVED QUICKLY AND SAFELY.WILL DO BUSINESS WITH THIS MERCHANT AGAIN."
2,These are weak,"Hello, i purchaced these to install but came across a set of infinity referance. The infinitys fit nicely and could handle 100 watts. These kenwoods needed a larger opening and were easily blow'en away with 40 watts at sixty watts they sound scratchy. Don't bother with these."
4,Interpreting,This book is a good resource for any interpreter who needs to understand how the gangs talk.
4,Mucho Cool,"VPC 3.0 is a very cool and extremely easy to use product. If you're like me and split your time between Macs and PCs it is invaluable. Sure- your Mac does everything a PC does, just better, but sometimes you need to use the Win version of Outlook or use a program that is Win only- This is the way to do it.I run VPC on my iMac DV- it was so simple to set up I was shocked. In the Win2000 environment my DSL connection is recognized, as is my Zip drive. Folders and files are easy to share and all in all speed is not too bad. There is some funkiness with things like 3-button mice, my trackball isn't supported and display settings can get a little wierd, but overall it makes using Win2000 easy. This is the real way to run a windows machine (now if I just had a MP G4)"
2,Borng,"This is very boring. I like to skip around in a puzzle, but this one makes you finih the word you are on. Not any fun at all as far as I am concerned and I love crosswords. Don't buy it."
5,A thoroughly enjoyable book.,"The selections in this book are sometimes hilarious, sometimes very moving, and always fascinating. The introduction is superb--it reminded me that bird watching is an invention, like basketball or football, and that its practitioners write about birds in ways that are determined by historical moment and cultural context. The book taught me a great deal about 18th and 19th Century culture and even more about birds and the obsessive and affectionate pursuit of them for the mere pleasure of seeing them in their natural habitats. This book was a pleasure all the way."
5,RHCP better and more interesting than the Beatles,"Fornication: The Red Hot Chili Peppers Story is a great story of one of the greatest bands ever! RHCP!!!They are 100 times more interesting and talented than those dopey boys from Liverpool, the Beatles."
4,"THANK YOU, JOHN BARR","I often wonder why there are so few good male popular/cabaret style performers compared to the multitude of female artists in the same genre. To make matters worse, many of the male singers sound like homogenized, uninterested participants. John Barr is happily an exception. He chooses intelligent and moving material and presents them with conviction without stooping to vocal tricks. This CD is for you if you want to hear wonderful songs performed with smooth sincerity."
1,Dated and directionless,"Let me start by saying ""I love Karen Voight."" I have nearly everything she's done, and I like nearly all of it. Except this. What I like about most of her videos is that they are not super complicated, or super dancey, but you get a great workout from a very straightforward lady. Well, I guess this is a great workout, since I couldn't do even half the foot moves, let alone the very complicated arms. But it is super dancey. And the styling and clothes? Let's just say that Farrah Fawcet and the old Jane Fonda's have some real competition. Give me the newer stuff any day. Smooth moves and Energy Sprint are among the best. And Karen, the hair? Stay short, ok?"
2,No Direction!,"Just a warning to anyone who is just starting, I work out every morning, this video was so discouraging. Karen does not ease into any moves. You can't keep up because she is changing without saying where to go..I love to sweat, but this was a turn off. I want to have a little direction. Not on of her best, and I love Voight videos."
4,Oldie but goodie,"I first bought this video about 14 years ago and loved the fact that it is fast-paced and high energy. Sadly the video literaly wore out and I was really pleased to find a replacement copy.This isn't a video for someone just starting out in exercise, it would be impossible to keep up. The choreography is quite complex and moves along at a cracking pace. It also looks quite dated, workout clothes, music etc. I still enjoy working out with karen though and love the old-style aerobics.If you are an advanced exerciser and love jumping around you will enjoy this video but it does look very different to the modern style aerobics. If you are used to Christie Taylor or Cathe Friedrich be prepared for something very different. A blast from the past."
5,Just perfect,"In a time when people swear to slow pilates (zzz), candle yoga, chakra spinning, ultra slow salsa low impact aerobics it's good to wake up the spirit and feel the joy of a proper fast full on high impact aerobics routine. Okay Karens cuing isn't the best in this video, but that doesn't bother me, because this video is a dying breed. Short routines, big movements and the music brings back all those sweaty memories from the aerobics studio back in the early 1990's! This video is challenging due to its intensity and impact, and that's just what I need. It finishes off with an abdominal workout and a stretch! Get this video if you love fast high impact aerobics and a good challenge. Enjoy"
4,Too tough but fun,"This video is only for truly advanced exercisers. The best thing is that it's fun and short. The moves take a little while to learn, but that's part of the enjoyment. Karen is an excellent instructor. I wish she would make more short aerobics videos. Strong and Smooth Moves is her best short one for beginnner/intermediate level aerobics lovers."
5,Great item,"Moog makes great stuff. Before buying the previous one I bought,(other side, also MOOG,) I consulted with at least a dozen car guys and pro mechanics... nearly all of them said Moog is the best substitute for OEM, even better than OEM in some cases. I even came across two people who use moog stuff for a sandrail and an offroading jeep. I know I will take them over Mercedes' double the price unit or any of the often dangerously poor quality aftermarket parts makers."
5,Kindle edition,"This is Roald Dahl at his best, I love his short stories that are a strange mix of the unbelievable, the morbid, the grotesque and the very believable.I started reading this on Kindle (as a sample), but when I had finished the sample and wanted to buy the book, it was ""no longer available"". Too bad :( Here's hoping it will be available on Kindle again!"
5,Everyman's library short stories,"Roald Dahl is one of the best writers ever. This is one of his best. Though most known for his children's stories, his adult literature is transcendant."
4,Not just for kids!,"Roald Dahl was my favorite author as a child. So when I heard about this work of adult fiction, I picked it up. What always made Dahl so great for kids was that he didn't talk down to them; he wasn't afraid to be a bit macabe and grotesque. But he never lacked heart. Well, these stories are much the same. Don't be fooled, however, for his reputation as a kid's write because these stories are definitely for the sophisticated reader.My only negative comment is that Dahl relies on many of the same themes and tricks of the trade in his stories. I happen to like twist endings, but for some people an entire book of them may become tiresome. All and all, definitely worth reading!\Get this thing back in print!"
3,bought it for my yr old son,"I seen it online and it looked awesome, it's ok , my son liked it at first but gets bored I think they replay the same trains over and over ."
4,A+ for 3 year old son,"We rented this movie so many time from the library, that I figured I better buy it. I gave it 4 stars becuase for he money I would reccomend spending a few more buck and but the I love toy train 5-pack DVD set...WAYYYYY more for your money! But this is a great movie for $10."
1,too scary for young children,"I was really disappointed with this DVD.The fires and the Halloween scenes were too much for my 3-year-old grandson. I threw it out, since I wouldn't want any other child to have it either. If you want a really good train DVD, get THE ALPHABET TRAIN ( Beautifully filmed and educational as well.) I am a child development professor, and have recommended THE ALPHABET TRAIN to several day care centers as well as friends. Another good one is I LOVE TOY TRAINS 4-5-6-. Amazon sells both."
5,kick butt cd,"this cd is sooo good. scorching guitar,some awesome vocals, with a good message, means none other than sick of change. i reccommend this cd to fans of slick shoes,mxpx,value pac,ect."
2,Stick with Games Magazine,"This program's format is similar to the first CD but with more types of mind benders. Unfortunately, the music and SFX are whisper quiet. The game ran sluggish on my PIII 600MHz, 128 MB computer. Typing in the answers to ""fill in the blank"" questions was painfully slow. I would have to hold down a single key on the keyboard for 2 to 3 seconds for it to show up on the screen. The game didn't give thorough instructions on how to play some of the games, just a one or 2 page primer on the object of each puzzle. In addition, the game doesn't give the answers to some puzzles.Save your money or at least put it towards a Games Magazine subscription, which is many times better than this item."
3,AC scale doesn't match range,"This unit has a 500V range scale and a 250V dial scale so whe you plug into a 120V outlet you only read 60V. I sent an email to the manufacturer and got a reply back that Said ""that is just the way it is"". I bought it to work on my cars and the DC scale is ok so I kept it. Lousy engineering and tech support that thinks this is OK."
3,amazing!!!!!!!!,I locked my office door and refused to anwser my phone untill i finished reading this book!! This is an amazing story and is wrote in a way that makes you feel for each of the characters involved. My only discontent is the replay of a third of the story told by Terry after Arthur had already told it. Although it gave great insite into what she was thinking. All and All im going to be anxiously awaiting a sequel!!who do i have to beg to to find out when its coming out????
5,"Wow! Libraries, bars and bathrooms will never look the same!","I devoured the amazing tale of Arthur, Iago, Jennings and Terry in one sitting....and what a journey we took! Scott Charles Adams has created THE gem of modern day vampire stories. Not only was I captured within the first 3 pages by an expertly written story , but the visual images he so masterfully crafted left me little doubt that I had a front row center seat for this years blockbuster! I can't wait to buy my ticket for the next ""show"" and find out what's in store for Arthur, Jennings and Iago in America......or more to the point, what's in store for America!"
2,Not so good,"King needs to slow down. This book is not nearly as good as the others in the series. Fans of the series should find it tolerable, but disapointing. I think King is cranking out too many books, and has definitely entered hack territory."
2,Disappointing,"I picked up this book expecting Gotrek and Felix to hack and slash their way to hordes and hordes of ghouls and the undead. But instead, I got a book that has its first half focusing on the aftermath of the siege of Praag and its title characters seeing miniscule amount of action. I have no expectations of philosphical quandaries or moral dilemmas for this series. I want action, action, action and action. Sadly, there are few and far between and Gotrek is given little chances to plow through hordes of enemies. Heck, he didn't even get to face mano-a-mano the title villain."
4,A Book Even a Mother Could Love...,"I've made 2 recipes from this cookbook in the past few weeks...Snapper Marinated in Sake and Miso Soup with Shrimp. The Snapper recipe is amazing. Some of the ingredients for these recipes may be hard to find for some people, especially people not in a large metropolitan area, but they are easily found on the internet.Just describing this recipe to my boyfriends' mother, she made it that same week and her teenage son's friends ate all of it. If young people will eat it, it has to be good...right?"
4,All about fish and shellfish,"This book is to be a gift and it answers all the questions I would think a person would want to know about the subject of fish and shellfish. I believe it will make the kind of cookbook that will be useful, and also open the door to many kinds of dishes that one may not know about."
1,Bad Company,I bought this cap and it would not work out of the box. I contacted the manufacturer for help and nobody would help me. It goes with the old saying you get what you pay for.
1,what a peice of junk,"I am very sad to say that I can't believe that I wasted my money on this cd. It was far from what I expected. Paul is trying to get to a bluessy feel. Anyone out there that remembers the days of Rough Cutt and Quiet Riot, then goes to listening to this will be deeply bothered by what they hear. Paul does have a good voice still, however, blues is not for him. He needs to stick to the rock. It's one thing to hear Glenn Hughes(Deep Purple, Black Sabbath, John Norum, etc...) sing the blues and that he does very well, but for Paul, it just doesn't suit him. Please Paul Get back together with The rest of Rough Cutt and do a reunion album."
5,Great Game!,This game is really fun. It keeps you busy for a very long time while you try to beat the races (there are three trophies per race) and try to unlock all of the cars. I highly reccomend you buy this game it is really fun.
3,Not as good as the ps2 version.,"This game is not as good for the ps2 version but it is still fun. It is very old and the first NFS to come out for the psp and the graphics r good for the vechicles but not the background. It is amazing of how good the graphics r for the veichles, they r better than carbons. U can not fix the car up as much as the newer ones but this is the only NFS that u can choose the color of the headlights and neon. This game was really easy at the begining untill u get halfway and the drifting and drag is impossible to beat when u r a celica and u r against corvettes. So i cant do anything now becides quick race and look at my cars. This is a fun game but it is very hard after awhile."
3,it could of ben better,this game is ok for the first week or so. after that it gets kinda boring. the best part of the game is the wireless play. thats the only reason why i play..
2,NFS UNDERGROUND RIVALS... FAME OR SHAME?,NEED FOR SPEED UNDERGROUND RIVALS ... FAME OR SHAME? LETS C THE PROS AND CONSTHE PROS:GOOD GRAPHICSNICE MUSICTHE CONS: $50 BUCKSYOU GET BORED OF IT AFTER A COUPLE OF DAYSREALLY THE SAME THING AS THE ORIGANAL NFS UNDERGROUNDWHEN U GO RELE FAST THE CAR GETS ALL SKIPYSO AS U CAN C THIS GAME GETS A SHAME!!THE CONS SHOW IT TO U !!!DONT WASTE YOUR TIME ON THIS GAME GO GET ATV OFFROAD FURY BLAZIN TRAILS
2,fity bucks for this?,"fity bucks for a ps2 game? i have a ds whick came with a FREE mario 64 ds which is like the n64 one but twice as long with different caracters batter graphics and only costs 30$!!!! over all, psp has the bells and whistles, but upon closer inspection, they are all expensive and the games are sub-par to the ds or even the ps2 and gamecube. don't waste you money, pass by the psp and go for the ds and better games."
1,CW600S,"This product does not work, it is a waste of money.Do not buy this product. I would not recommend this product.Thanks"
5,wonderful,My wife loves this gift. Perfect as a consistent place to put her wedding ring when she is not wearing it.
5,Aayyeeeaah!!,"When the sensitive and compassionate British booted the Acadians out of Nova Scotia in 1755, it was Canada's loss and the U.S.A.'s gain, not the least of which applies to their happy music.And the distinctive Cajun sound, a patois combining archaic French forms with English, Spanish, German, and India idioms, only serves to make that music all the more delightful.Listen to any track - especially those involving Zydeco legends Clifton Chenier and Queen Ida, or Cajun singers Rusty & Doug [Kershaw] and Jo-El Sonnier, and I defy you to sit still. C'est nes pas possible, ma cher!With this package, first released by Rhino in 1990, you also get two pages of background notes written by the then Associate Editor of Living Blues Magazine, Mary Katherine Aldin, as well as a track-by-track commentary on the song and performer. The sound quality is excellent.Bon temps rouler indeed."
2,Torin: You Owe Me Parts To My Purchase!!!!,"I should have purchased one of these a long time ago. The machine works fine and will press-out the most stubborn u-joint, etc. The only problem I encountered was upon delivery the press was missing one (1) stabilizer bar. I contacted Torin out in Southern California about three (3) weeks ago...left multiple phone messages and have yet to hear back from them or receive the missing part. Bottom line: If the product arrives missing an item you're probably out of luck and will have to use an unstable/dangerous machine like me because customer service does not exist.**Torin rep, send me my missing item. Just check you're message machine from about a month ago...it has my name, phone number, address, zip code, item purchased and missing part stated on multiple recordings**"
3,"Needs modification to assemble, drifts side to side, overall good for the money",I had to file several holes wider in order to be able to make up the bolts.It is fine for small tasks in a home garage.
3,Disappointed,"I purchased this 12 ton press rather that a less expensive Harbor Freight model for two reasons...1) I have several other Torin products that are adequately constructed2) The pictured press illustrates more thoughtful and substantial construction than the Harbor Freight pressUnfortunately, what showed up was IDENTICAL to a Harbor Freight press, NOT what was pictured. Further more, the item and its packaging arrived damaged - several parts had to be placed in a vice in order to straighten them out so that the bolts would line up properly. The painted finish is thin, and even absent in many areas.Overall, this is not the press I thought it would be, but weighing in at 100lbs and having nothing but shredded packaging to return it in, I can't easily send it back. I'm hoping it performs better than it appears."
3,cheap press for small projects,this press is adequate for small projects. It's not the sturdiest press out there but for the price its good. the only thing that i didn't like about it was the fact that there is a lot of play in the press bar and it will wiggle left and right as it situates itself on the object you're pressing. this can sometimes cause an incorrect amount of pressure on the side of the object you're working on. just get a piece of wood and jam it between the press bar and the side of the press to keep it from wiggling.
5,The Best of the Chantels,"Loved this CD, brought back many memories.Arlene Smith ,the lead singer has a great powerful voice. The harmony with the rest of the group is fantastic. The Chantels opened the door for all the future all girl groups. If your into old rock & roll I would highly recommend this CD."
2,BEWARE -- This toy is very small,"Be very aware that this thing is tiny. Not at all what we expected. The description says that it is 4.5""(I admit we missed that), but that is wing tip to wing tip. The packaging also says that it weighs 1lb. My guess is that it would take 50 of them to get to a pound. Very surprised that this toy received a couple 5 star reviews."
5,The next big thing?,"At first I was suspicious that an English speaking Japanese band could hold much sway in the international indie/rock market- then I heard 'On My Way Back Home' for the first time. By the time the first track, 'Everlasting Scene' had reached it's climax I was hooked! And it didn't stop there- the album relentlessly throws the awesome 'Sign' into your ears and proceeds then to take you on an incredible emotion stirring journey that will leave you breathless.Believe the hype- the album draws heavy influences from everyone from The Goo Goo Dolls, Smashing Pumpkins and The Lemonheads to Coldplay, Travis and Oasis. Fans of any of the above will not be disappointed.The album is best served on a hot summer day, kickin' back with your mates- it's sound is anthemic, meloncholic and profoundly beautiful.The album was recently voted the 12th best album of 2005 in London's 'Loud & Quiet' magazine and justifiably so.Don't take my word for it. See for yourself."
3,poor packaging arrangement,The first time i purchased this thing - everything was great! but the second time there was a shortage of screws set. (
5,Electric blue and functional,"I thought my RB3 strat was on the fritz but all I needed was a new midi, this little blue tester was the right price and gives just enough length between MIDI controller and guitar without extra heavy cable coming loose. Fixed my RB3 pro guitar mode woes promptly and permanently."
5,Awesome Idea!!!!,"This is a fantastic idea that we can all get used to! DVD Preview reviews DVD's from the newest release to classics, also lets us in on what television shows have come out on DVD for us to catch up on! Leonard Maltin is the most knowledgable reviewer out there! DVD Preview has staff writers that are currently the hottest in the industry...I think this is so fun, and amazing. Get yourself a copy, Today!"
5,Great Collection of Engine Photos,"I purchased this book for our son, who has just completed engineer school for the railroad. What fun to look through it with him. It is a wonderful collection of great photos of many railroads in our country. Until our son worked for the railroad, we always called train engines ""engines"", but in the industry, they are referred to as ""powers"", thus the title Rail Power.This is a very informative book about the history and highlights of trains; even the driving of the golden spike that joined the railroad from the east to the railroad from the west, creating the first transcontinental railroad. Do you know where that celebration took place?"
1,Do not buy bulb does not last,"The original bulb lasted a few years. I haven't had the replacement bulb more than a month and it stopped working, stay away from this product."
1,Don't buy this...,"This bulb arrived without any of the manufacturer's packaging, and it died after about two weeks... Definitely not worth it."
1,Poor Product Delivery,"I ordered this product expecting to receive something in the original packaging. Instead, I did not receive what I ordered but instead received two bulbs in a small plastic envelop."
3,"some good material , but not always","Biafra talks about some very important issues that are funny , and frightening , but his voice is very irritating , and sometimes he drags on & on and forgets what he is talking about."
4,NIce bag but heavy,"This bag is pretty nice. Its as good as promised. Looks clean and elegant. However, I found 2 negative points with this bag.1) Its bit heavy compared to other bags. If this is not a problem for you thats fine. But check the weight before buying it2) The zip is only for the middle compartment. The 1st and 3rd compartments are not zip protected. This can't be clearly seen in the pics."
4,I'd like a deeper soup bowl,"Corelle is a great brand, and I really love how much abuse their dish wear takes. I was looking for a deeper bowl for soup and pasta; it was difficult to discern the depth from the description of ""15-Ounce"", but took a chance. Needless to say, these were not what I had in mind as the bowls are not even an inch deep. They would be good for small dinner salads, however. Because they were reasonably priced, and I know they'll last forever, I'm going to keep them, but I will still be on the hunt for proper soup bowls."
4,A Little Disappointed,I gave this item 4 stars mainly because it is not very deep used as a soup bowl. This piece will be perfect for salads/however for a soup bowl I like something with a little more depth to it. Once again Kudos to Amazon for such fast shipping/Rec'd my order in less than 3 days time and the sale price and free shipping was another positive plus!!!
1,Not good,"Poor quality. The music is too dramatic for the low budget self made video. Seems he is a talented artist, but not a talented videographer"
5,good product,"good product, good price, dry minced garlic wasnt easy to find, and i bought it here because i got a decent price"
3,Fragrant!,"The garlic is okay, but I'm not so happy that even when the container is closed tightly this smells up my cabinet."
4,For the fishies,Works great. Just what I needed to replace a very old and crumbling part to my quiet Whisper filter. HOpefully will keep the baby guppies out of the filter now!
3,Bllllleeeeeeeeeegh,"I abosolutely hated this book with a pation. The book's story was oranairy and and the book just didnt grab my attention. When the author decided to write his book in the fom of letters it was a major mistake! Not only did you not know what time you were in, you didnt know who was talking most of the time and to whom the letter was addressed to! This book just make you sick to your stomach. I think his book should be burned and should never be spoken of again."
3,bbblllleeeeeeeeeeeeeeeegga,I hated this book with a pation. Out of the many books i read there are but a select few that i dispise and Vlad The Undead is one of them. The author decided to write this book from a letter point of view which is one of the parts i hate most about it. This book gets so confuseing because you dont know what point in time the letters were written or to whom they are addressed! Just even writing this review my stomach hurts! This story was clearly not ment to be written from this point of view. I also did not like the ending because you knew how the book was going to end by the end of the 2nd chapcter. All and All i really didnt like this book and i dont recomend it to anyone who doesnt belong to MENSA and doesnt like vampires.
2,"Adequate, but Expensive","Loved the ""look"" of this on the list photo and had great hopes for it. The scale is adequate, appears to be accurate, certainly stylish. However, for its size, which is large, and for it's price, which is significant, I expected something heavier and sturdier. It's not the quality I would have expected or was looking for given the price."
4,as advertised,This is what they say. the company shipped without any problems and they have good shipping rates.
2,"Good content, disjointed organization","I finished reading the introduction which is from a sermon delivered by Tozer, and that made a lot of sense. However I'm in the middle of the first chapter, and every few paragraphs is from a different Tozer source. While loosely organized by topic, it reads (so far) like a book of random quotes, of which you can expect some will be gems, but you really don't know what to expect next. In short, it doesn't seem there's a storyline or a direction to the organization within each chapter."
1,"""Monstrous Regiment of Women"" is monstrous disappointment","I really enjoyed ""The Beekeeper's Apprentice"" and eagerly bought ""A Monstrous Regiment of Women"". It is a self-indulgent diatribe, surprisingly boring, and a bad case of women's lib run amok. I called my sister to warn her off, but she had already started it and could not imagine why she kept falling asleep. I read 3 to 5 books a week (the downside of being a really fast reader) and usually 2 or 3 of them are mysteries of the manners variety. This book has no humor, less plot, pages of nothing but musings. Total waste of time and money. If you liked ""Beekeeper"", chances are you'll be less than impressed by ""Regiment""."
3,Take out the Holmes romance and it's good,"I would have enjoyed this book, but I just couldn't get past the Holmes angle. Not only was he out of character, but the whole romance subplot ruined an otherwise ripping mystery for me. I won't be reading any more Mary Russell tales, but I hope this author branches out."
1,They don't get any better,"The only reason I read this book is that I had it with me while traveling. Again, like ""the beekeeper's daughter"" it belittles Holmes at the expense of a new female character. It is lame and tiresome. I'll gnaw off my arm before I touch another book by this author."
3,Disappointing...,"After reading The Beekeeper's Apprentice this is a very disappointing sequel indeed. It is about Mary Russell and Sherlock Holmes embarking on a case. There are many people getting murdered in a group of women, and then Russell and Holmes find out what happened, as usual. It is long and boring. The only important thing in the book, is the development of Russell's and Holmes's bond together, which is explained in the next book, A letter of Mary. In a nutshell, this is an abysmal book."
4,"Not much of a mystery, but excellent character study","It will perhaps shock Ms. King--and certainly disgust Holmes and Russell--that their personal relationship is a vast deal more intriguing than the actual mystery in ""Monstrous Regiment"". Ms. King knows exactly what words to put in her characters' mouthes because she believes in them, and so do we, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle notwithstanding. The mystery in itself is frankly boring, but, maybe more to the point,it intrigues Russell, and as she says, ""If detecting is what I do, than theology is what I am."" A nice touch.It's the vague yet almost palable ache between these two delightful misfits that impresses me most in King's second in the series, as well as her encyclopediac knowledge of London and environs, and her top-drawer characterizations, especially of the redoubtable Mycroft and Watson. But if it's strictly mystery you're after, you may be disappointed."
5,A Wonderful Read,"Laurie R. King has written another masterpiece. This book advances the relationship between the brilliant Mary Russell and her mentor, the legendary Sherlock Holmes. Full of fascinating secondary characters and subplots, this book will hold you from start to finish. I myself could not put it down once, and ended up reading deep into the night. An extremely satisfying read."
3,Shades of Gaudy Night,"I tried hard to enjoy A Monstrous Regiment of Women, and it actually wasn't so bad, but I kept having the feeling that the author was recreating for her characters, Mary Russell and Sherlock Holmes, the scenes and sentiments of Dorothy L. Sayers's materpiece, Gaudy Night, also set in Oxford and London between the wars. If you like King's book, please try the original. It is much better written!A note (referring to the original hardcover edition: This book is full of typos. The worst two that I found were a reference to ""chairwomen"" instead of ""charwomen"" and the assertion that Abigail Adams was born in 1774. I gather there wasn't an awful lot of proofreading going on when this one was in production ..."
1,A Monstrous Regiment of Women,Very Disappoinnting. I enjoyed The Beekeepers Apprentice much more. I will finish it but not enjoying it. Looking forward to the next in the series and hope it will be better.
4,A romance that transcends morality and propriety,"It hardly bears mentioning any longer that Ms. King's second ""Mary"" book demonstrates all the technical skill of the first. The plotting and the characterization are excellent.I wonder though, why I am the only one disturbed by the implications of this intimate relationship between an elderly man and his minor protegee. Does Laurie King mean to imply that the only woman that Holmes could love would have to be one he created? And how sick is that?Nevertheless, I am impressed by Ms. King's treatment of the traditional Holmes mystery from a proto-feminist point of view. This juxtaposition of the world's most famous misogynist as a lover and a defender of women's rights, gives an added, compelling dimension to the man."
3,not as good as the first or third,"This is a good book, but not as good as the first or third book in the series. That is as far as I have read so far."
1,Biggest disappointment I've ever encountered,"The Beekeeper's Apprentice was one of my favorite books ever, and when I saw there was a sequel, I couldn't wait to read it. In her first book, Laurie R. King perfectly encapsulated the Sherlock Holmes of literary fame -- in this one, she utterly destroys him. I don't want to give away plot twists, but the character is decimated and the mystery dull. I imagined that Holmes would someday adopt Russell; it would have been much more palatable than the plot twist tossed into this mess! I had to go back and tell everyone I recommended The Beekeeper's Apprentice to NOT to read the sequel -- very depressing."
4,A really enjoyable read,"I thoroughly enjoyed the deepening relationship between Holmes and Russell. They are two halves of a whole. The sub-plot of romance and even a bit of sexual tension was more fun than the actual mystery. When Mary's friend Ronnie remarks that Holmes has a heaping amount of SA (sex appeal), it helps to validate Mary's feelings.This is a wonderful series of books. Despite the fact that I'm no feminist, I enjoy observing the world through this perspective."
3,Another disappointed reader,"Not a great follow-up book to ""The Beekeepers Apprentice"". Holmes is absent way too much and the relationship that some may find highly romantic between Mary and Holmes seems unconvincing no matter how intellectually compatible they may be. Like the first book it becomes apparent to me after reading that Sherlock Holmes is just a gimmick holding the book to an impossible standard and another similar fictional character should have been put in his place but that wouldn't sell as many books would it? Did anyone else find it ironic to have Doyle criticized by characters in the book?"
4,I like this series!,"In the second book of her Mary Russell/Sherlock Holmes series, author Laurie King uncovers the world of religious fervor and burgeoning feminism in London during the early 1920's.A wealthy Oxford classmate of Mary's has given up her cushy life to work for a charismatic leader of a mostly female congregation. The only trouble with the arrangement is that some of the congregation's most wealthy patrons are dying under mysterious circumstances.Mary and Holmes join forces to find the cause and source of the accidental deaths. Their electric relationship continues to grow, baffling both the young woman and her much older partner. Russell continues to learn from AND teach Holmes, while Holmes seems to be pulled closer and closer to his young charge.Their difficulties provide a rich backdrop to their relationship, making the entire reading experience fulfilling and thoroughly entertaining.Enjoy!"
5,Buzzing with joy!,"This book is an incredibly well-written, beautiful demonstration of character development and insight into two great minds! Though Holmesian purists might cringe, the relationship is entirely believable and excellently done! Love and friendship know no age! This book is one you'll never forget and will treasure forever!"
5,"MREG is an LRK value-vehicle, but a good read","This mystery isn't as fast-paced as many, and it's rather obvious Margery Childe's sermons are a vehicle for some of Laurie King's own beliefs. However, King writes beautifully and evokes the era with great skill. The tension between Holmes and Russell, caused by Russ's doubts about their relationship, threads throughout the book and effectively links the first, shocking hansom-cab scene to the eventual dock scene. I did approve of the eventual turn R&H's relationship took. A 40-year age difference is cause for an initial squirm or two, but it really isn't as though Holmes was eighty-five. And, hopeless romantic sap that I am, Holmes and Russ make me melt. ;) Not really a purist book, but the purists can stay in the nineteenth century. Thank you."
2,The Problem of the Slipshod Pastiche,"Actually, ""monstrous"" doesn't begin to describe the outrageous liberties which Laurie R. King takes with the master detective in this, her second resurrection of Sherlock Holmes in her Mary Russell series. Nor does that fine word cover the extent of the disappointment which readers, your truly included, feel (or are likely to feel) after trudging through a lame plot - laced with religious philosophy that's about as subtle as being brained with a service revolver - only to arrive at a cliched ending straight out of MACMILLIAN AND WIFE. Those who thrilled to King's truly remarkable THE BEEKEEPER'S APPRENTICE will no doubt wish to discover how Mary Russell developes into her own, but be warned: this time, the game is afoot, and it's limping - badly."
5,Even better than the first,"I adored the Beekeeper's Apprentice and was almost hesitant to read the second in the Mary Russell series, even while dying to find out more about Holmes and Russell. I wasn't disappointed. Monstrous Regiment surpassed my expectations by a mile. Mary Russell is mature, in command of her fortune and sparks between her and Holmes are starting to show. This book was so fascinating that it got me started researching the suffragete movement in England. A wonderful read, a great mystery and a lovely coming of age story. Laurie R. King does it again!"
2,"Interesting idea, but...","The book is amusing. However, it is not a well written book: it lacks in the plot department. The story meanders and two thirds into the book one starts to wonder when the mystery is going to get momentum. Finally, close to the end, the author must have remembered that the she is actually writing a crime/ mystery story and not a church/women's lib book.I wanted to read a mystery and not some pseudo historical blah. Sherlock and Russell were of interest to me, not some full length church sermons (I'd go to church for that). I guess, I would compare it to the tabloids available at the cash register: amusing but without substance."
4,"Interesting, but not definitive","Obviously, being an unauthorised biography, there is only so much that Myles Palmer could do in terms of research, so it's fair to say that he's done a very good job with the tools available. Most comments that are unsubstantiated are stated as such, and hearsay is usually clearly noted. It's a pity Knopfler chose not to assist, as he's painted in a positive light on the whole - goodness knows why he couldn't make some sort of contribution.Bear in mind that this is now relatively out of date, and therefore misses the latter parts of his career."
4,Review of Print Collecting,"This small book contains a great deal of data for the print collector. Very informative comprehensive view of print-making, from identification to cleaning and repair. Includes easy-to-understand printmaking terms and definations throughout the book. Excellent organization, with complete table of contents and index. Obviously written by a passionate collector and instructor."
4,Spiritual Classic,"I loved this book and the message was powerful, but it's a little heavy on the suffering side, rendering it, in my opinion, appropriate for a more advanced spiritual reader. Don't let the brevity fool; ""Let Go"" is deep and rightly meditative."
3,Legendary Brawl!,"I got my OOP VHS of Darker Than Amber last week. I had heard a lot about the legendary brawl between hero Rod Taylor and villian William Smith. I wanted to see the movie and knew I would probably have to pay a little extra for it. First, I thought the movie was pretty good though it was a bit dated. Even though it was dated it didn't take away from the story which was pretty good. I didn't know anything about the books or the character of Travis McGee when I first started watching. I enjoyed the movie but I must say that the print was really bad. Also somebody posted the entire final fight scene on Youtube and after watching both I realized that a lot of it was cut out of the VHS version. Still a good movie but it needs to be remastered. It is really grainy and seems almost like it is something somebody recorded on VHS off of TV."
3,"Cheesy, low-budget, yet worth watching","This was the 1st in a proposed series of ""Travis McGee"" films which never got off the ground after this first (and only) effort. Abysmal production values, but a good cast & fairly faithful to J.D. MacDonald's vision. Rod Taylor made for a pretty good McGee & Theodore Bikel was an excellent Meyer. And of course William Smith was also very good as the main villain. VERY violent & bloooody, with one of the most expertly choreographed fight scenes in cinema history. (Right up there with Connery vs. Robt. Shaw in ""From Russia With Love"".) In fact, the slam-bang climax was superior to the book's version. Interesting that the American release of the VHS version severely cut out a lot of the violent stuff. Way overdue for a restored DVD version. Too bad the producers along with Taylor & Bikel didn't continue on after this low-budget, but promising beginning."
4,Great for Boys or Tomboys!,"This book is listed for kids age 4 and up, but my son, who just turned 2, just LOVES it! It has pop-up construction vehicles (bulldozer, forklift, etc.), and some have moving parts! Now, when we go to Home Depot, he can't wait to watch the forklifts..."
5,CHAN MANGA IN MOTION,This was one of chans best roles i thought he was great all the girls were beautiful this movie is much better then 007 and Austin powers it had an awesome fight scene between gary danials where they portrayed Street Fighter characters if you liked Twin Dragons and Rush Hour you will love this one go buy it right now
4,"Jackie takes his farce to a new level, superbly as usual!","I saw this movie in chinese language release, but as you might guess Chans physical, slapstick acting and comedy spoke for itself. This time he took his normally outragous style to a new level to create his biggest spoof since ""Half a Loaf of Kung-Fu"", but the action delivers reliably in this film which includes a showdown where Jackie and the bad guy litteraly turn into ""Street Fighter"" characters! This is an action packed flick is remeniscient of the old ""batman"" TV series in it's use of bright, simple colors. Not his best, but you know that still means two thumbs up!"
1,I HATE THIS MOVIE!!!,"What is this? Jackie plays a perpetually hungery, woman crazy detective who follows a woman onto a ship, and gets caught in a web of inpossible events. Jackie's character was dumb and slow, and there were few fight scenes that were good. The only good points of this movie were the woman lead, who was awesom, and the outtakes at the end!! this movie doesn't deserve a single star, and it's no offense to Jackie. PLEASE DON'T BUY THIS CRAP!!!!!!!"
3,"goofy, but okay.","When I saw this movie I thought it was pretty cheesy, but I did like the way it was a parody to Japanimation films. Not as many fight scenes and stunts as your conventional Jackie Chan movie, but what it does have is alright."
4,A live action anime!,"This movie uses many anime conventions, like giant mallets, character flashbacks and other little things any anime fan can pick up by watching. Some good fight scenes, some inane dialogue and some very beautiful ladies (watch for the voluptuous comic relief girl WOW!!) make for a fun movie!"
3,funny!,At first I thout it was kind of a childish movie. But towards the end with the Street fighters I laugh so hard because it was just like street fighters. So even know I gave it three stars still go get it it's good.
1,"Elementary, My Dear Watson","As a creationist, I read as much of the evolutionary ""material"" as I have time - Gould, Dawkins, et al. The one problem with an author like Tim Berra, who attempts to critique creationism, is that you can tell by his arguments he doesn't have a clue about the scientific evidence for intelligent design and special creation. He spews venom in the preface of his book that costs him credibility before you get to the first chapter of the book. He speaks of ""creationists (who) are determined to impose their views on others"" and then proceeds to commit the same offense from the opposite perspective. After reading the book, I must say that if someone is going to argue the scientific case for evolution, they should avoid discarded case studies and theories such as the horse fossil sequence, ""ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny"" and the peppered moth among others. All in all, a good read and reinforcement of the creationist point of view in the same category as ""The Blind Watchmaker""."
1,This Sells?,"Berra begins by stating his experience as an educator and then gives us ""the end all"" of arguments for evolution. His book not only is inaccurate in many of its principles, it is simply a repackaged freshman biology textbook mainly focusing on evolutionary biology. All I have to say is that anyone who says that whales' hindlimbs serve no function must not think excretion and mating are important."
3,This book is misnamed,"While the book gives a clear overview of basic evolutionary theory, the chapter on creationism seems artificial. If you are looking for indepth explanations of evolution, look elsewhere. If you are looking for solid arguments against creationist dogma, look elsewhere. If you are looking for an introduction to evolution, this book may do the trick. The glossery is pretty good."
1,Why is this belief accepted as logical?,"If I were an evolutionist, I would be able to tell you is this book was any good, but I am not.(The only reason I rated this book is because Amazon wouldn't let me skip that step). I just wanted to inquire on why so many people can accept this belief that life so complex as the human race, and any other living being for that matter, could just happen because of one little cell having the desire to become something that could funtion as we do. The father of evolution himself said that the human eye was to complex to have evolved, and because of our eye's amazing capabilities to focus to light and colors and many other things, he said the theory of evolution was absurd, and he actually said absurd! If anybody can give me some logical reasons why I and many others should believe the theory of evolution, please post them."
5,Excellent educational science book about evolution,"Kudos to Dr. Berra. The scientist or layman can use this work as a source of concrete facts and background for understanding evolutionary theory and why misrepresentation of fact can be so insidious when masquerading as science, as it is with ""creation science"" proponents. Dr. Berra has written a fascinating, compact book of unimpeachable facts in a manner that completely blows the pseudoscientific propaganda out of the water. This book should be included in any collection, from those with a passing interest in the subject to those needing good source material for university-level study."
3,OK high-school-level intro,"The intent of this book is to present the facts and arguments in the debate about creationism versus evolution. It does a reasonably good job of introducing the basic arguments in this debate in a historical context, and then basically states the currently accepted theory of evolution. It also shows how the legal debate is focused on the political issue regarding public school curriculum.This book is not an even-handed exploration of the debate (which would be hard to do in any case). Nor does it offer compelling arguments for either side."
3,SAGOH 247 < ANBERLIN,"Although I'm an Anberlin fan, I'm not a Sagoh 247 fan. The CD is a great ""indie"" CD and the tracks are well written, but their sound and style is still audibly undeveloped. If you're looking for a great CD I'd tryBlueprints for the Black Market."
1,Poor connection,Unless you keep the cable completely still this cable will not make a pretty sound. I find it mostly disfunctional
2,A disappointment,"5 chapters and 124pages of introduction to DNS, SMTP, and assorted blah. The author does an ok job of walking through the Postfix internals - 30+ pages just on postfix lookup tables. The book really disappointed in describing Postfix server operations. In fact, there appear to be a few errors. Following the book verbatim led to a BROKEN postfix server. Fortunately, Google knows all."
1,don't wast your time or money,"After reading the reviews I thought I'd give this book a try. I had an immediate need to set up a postfix email server with virtual hosts that would check their email via POP3. I've learned nothing from this book that I couldn't have gotten from the online documentation and it is an insult to any Linux administrator. I'm still at the same point I was before getting this book. Same issues, no insights into how to fix it. It doesn't even cover setting up POP3 access for virtual hosts.If you think this book will give you an easier read than the online documentaion, don't bother. I had the online documentation open and it follows it so closely that it seems the author was simply paraphrasing the documentation. The only areas that it goes into more detail are irrelevent issues, like setting up ISDN (isn't that out of the scope of this book?) and how to run strace!Again, don't bother. I want my money back!"
2,Not Recommened; Too broad and general,"Kind of regret getting this book.I was hoping to see more of Postfix then described in this book. Like for example what's ""empty_address_recipient"" do and what parameter can it take and so on. Or how to work content_filter with other filter scripts so I can implement any spam and virus filter and so on. It doesnt even talk about it!The book only gave an introductory broadview, but that's about it. It's probably ok if that's all you need."
2,"Padded, imprecise, superficial","The books is definitely padded; all these Unix books seem start off with a hundred pages about the most mundane admin tasks that every admin knows how to do ANYWAY -- ""Postfix"" is no exception in that regard.I took some time to check the pages between the padding, and found several errors, omissions or imprecise statements about how Postfix works.All in all the book is quite superficial when it comes to how to actually USE the stuff described -- examples are missing like:""If I get spammed like this, what can I do to prevent this?""This somewhat limits the use of the book, since you have to find out that stuff yourself, by trial and error.It's hard to say if the book is targeted at an admin (then he/she should know SMTP and DNS -- and be annoyed by the padding) or a newbie (thenhe/she gets some info, but might end up with a system that's uglier than it needs to be)."
1,Do *not* buy this!,Horrible bookSpends 50% explaining how to install Redhat and skips almost every dificult feature postfix has. Instead it spends pages on how to build Courier IMAP or BIND from tar. A much better O'Reilly book is due to come out soon. Do Not waste your money on this book!!!
2,Funny but a Little empty,"There was some great info in this book and it was well written. The problem is it's skimpy when it comes to the dirty work. They really leave alot of the real tough stuff up to the reader to figure out, and thats when most readers need a book!Well since there are not that many choices out there this book is not that bad but hopefully some day there will be a better one."
5,This is a great book,"Richard Blum writes great books, open source email security and another book I forget, something about network traffic analysis. this is a great book for those sendmail folks fedup with config files :)Feel free to contact me anytime about my other comments I have or info about Postfix itself. I'm a self made user and run my own anti-spam server using postfix/amavis/razor and spam assassin.dolly@mxdemo.borderware.com"
2,Not as pictured,"The Product description doesn't even make remote sense. It talks about Pick up covers, TRON, voice overs, and computer specifications, so I don't think I'm to blame for not reading the description.Anywho...The picture shows covered pickups, the ones I received have the holes in them. I rather like the covered pickup look. I guess for 5 bucks it's still not a bad deal for 3 of them...definitely not worth sending them back, but it's still not what I ordered..."
5,Awesome!,"I am in disbelief that I only paid $20 for this heavy, massive, beautifully made cleaver! It is a gorgeous thing, and HEAVY! Nicer than many of the knives I've paid 10 times that for! I can't WAIT to use it. Seriously - don't go out and pay $200 for a Henkels or F.Dick - get one of these monsters. Gorgeous. And The Wok Shop is getting my business from now on. I only ordered this cleaver and a few other items day before yesterday and here everything is, plus she put in a few free things. Everything is very high quality - I will buy from them in the future for certain."
4,Hefty and Sharp,"It doesn't do miracles, and that's the only reason I won't confuse this cleaver with some other cleaver that does and deserves a 5 star rating. However, you won't regret buying this hefty and sharp cooking tool. I won't need another cleaver, this one works just fine."
1,"Fooled by positive reviews, I'm afraid.","An astonishingly inferior product-- the blade is comically soft. Used it to chop up the smaller bits of our Xmas turkey carcass for soup, and the blade just bent and dented completely on very small, very SOFT bones (bones which a mat-knife cut through easily). It is rendered completely unusable for anything, and appears to be too narrow a blade edge to sharpen properly. Ohhhhh, the low price connected to the glowing reviews should have been a dead giveaway. . . No, do not buy this product-- just don't, really."
3,Too heavy,"I didn't realize how heavy this was..and it will be hard for me to use. I wanted a chopper for all purpose use, and this one will be only for maybe cutting meat and chicken."
1,Iffy Electronics?,"I just purchased this radio locally, and I'm going to have to return it. The buttons aren't working. Considering that I've had trouble with another model weather radio from Midland, I wouldn't buy another product made by that company."
4,Wal-Mart Almost Giving Them Away,"My local Wal-Mart store in Naples, Florida is selling Midland WR-10 Weather Radios for two bucks ($2.00) each! (The radio originally sold for about 30 bucks at Wal-Mart).I bought about a dozen of them to pass out to my friends. The radio does EXACTLY what it's intended to do...give weather information and weather alerts, and it also has the AM and FM bands.You can set the radio to be absolutely quiet until it receives a weather alert.The instructions are very clear and an included pamphlet gives the NOAA weather frequencies for all the major cities in the USA,(which can be easily set at the bottom of the radio). There are a number of other neat features which I won't go into here. So RUN to your local Wal-Mart and see if they still have any left at this absolutely amazing price!My only problem... The radio is made in China, but then, just about everything in Wal-Mart comes from the Orient!"
1,This is not a very good radio.,"I live about 40 miles from our NOAA broadcast station. For this radio to pick up thier broadcast, I have to hold the radio in my hands and face it South. Very often it puts out a growling noise that totally drowns out any broadcast that I may be trying to listen to. I've always been happy with Midland products, but they have themselves a lemon here. Spend your money on something else."
1,Terrible Design and Reception,"For my needs, this NOAA Radio stinks. The design is terrible for a couple reasons:1: It has TERRIBLE reception. I must place the unit near the ceiling to pickup a broadcast2. The unit is designed to only be sitting flat and because I have no high shelves, I have difficulty keeping the unit upright3. It needs a more powerful antenna4. It has a 9-volt battery which seems to drain even when the unit is plugged in 24/7. You don't even know the battery is drained until you lose power and by then it may be too lateI've had this unit for over 5 years and I can't stand the design. It works as advertised but it has serious design flaws."
5,"insane comfort, real quality boots.","I purchased these boots about 3 months ago. When I tried them on I thought sure they will be comfortable but 200.00 dollards please!! When I put them on I was sold. It felt like I was walking on air. You could walk all day in these and not feel run down. They are light and very warm at the same time. I own a few pairs of Rocky boots but these are the BEST!! True quality hunting boots, Well done Rocky, well done!!"
1,did I miss something?,"I must have either missed a whole bunch of allusions and metaphors in this book, otherwise I simply can't understand what the previous reviewers were thinking. I found the story incredibly disjointed, becoming more so towards the conclusion. Perhaps owing to my own obtuse nature I failed to understand anything concerning the plot or the characters. One the whole, nothing was resolved to my satisfaction. I can only hope that other readers will have a more satisfying experience that my own. Please - don't hesitate to fill me in if you can figure this one out! cheers"
4,"I LOVED ""why I don't want to be a woman"" paraaagrah","I don't remember much about the book except that one paragraph detailing ""why I don't want to be a woman."" I have had to check out the book from the libaray again just to read that one paragraph. I remember enjoying the book, but that one paragraph. When DID I sign up for the beauty contest, anyway? I don't remember."
2,I will never finish this,"All the reviews say that the parts of this book are better than the whole. To me, the parts are mildly amusing and quite disjointed. So far (1/2 way into the book) I would rather be reading a selection of short stories. So if the whole is less than the sum of its parts, I might as well quit reading this book now."
2,ODD!,Easy to read...very odd! The author has quite an imagination! (At least I hope it's just his imagination! haha!)
3,A decent (but inappropriately titled) cookbook,"For someone truly concerned about eating a low-fat diet, this book is sure to disappoint. No nutritional information is provided for the recipes, and with 12-muffin recipes calling for 1/2 cup oil, many wouldn't seem to fit anyone's definition of low fat. Of the eight recipes I've made so far, none were especially bad or good, and most were fairly easy to make. Half of the book (every other page) is really a travel guide with descriptions of the various bed and breakfasts from which these recipes came. All but one recipe is vegetarian, but many contain eggs and dairy products. The chapters are: Beverages (4 recipes), Fruit (12), Entrees (22), Breads and Coffeecakes (5), Muffins and Scones (12), and Additional Treats (5). With a total of only 60 recipes, I might have been better off spending more money to get a truly low-fat cookbook with a large chapter on breakfasts."
4,Excellente!,"This is a great World Book for Rifts Earth on the NGR and its powerful Triax Industries. As always, the art work is of fine quality, and the combination of NGR vs. the Gargoyle Empire you can come up with is endless! However, in the area of general data on Europe, it could have used more."
4,Hedgewitch By Rae Beth A Review,"I was revisting a Yule Episode of River Cottage in which Hugh Fernley-Whittingstall was looking for his Yule log and consulted his local Hedge Witch on the matter which lead me to this book being found. I settled on Rea's book after rejecting other books that were way too Wiccian.The print format is good and allows me to underline and make notes on her lessons to her 2 friends.I will heartily recommend this book for those are new to the craft.The Only negatives I have are that the need of a hedgewitch to have his/her feet firmley rooted into the land itself and that Plant and weatherlore is not addressed and that she refers to the Burning times which in England,Wales and the American Colonies never happened!,Burning did happen on the Continent and in Scotland but that was more for heresy(if your were Catholic)than Witchcraft As a ex-Coven witch I found this a good book overall!"
2,Poor quality; expensive additional figures,"I cannot believe how expensive this was for 'what you get'. You get $5 worth of toy, plus a lot more money for the Disney branding I guess. Bits come off too easily and can't be put on by the child (top door, trap doors, slide, boot bit etc.). It comes with two characters, but additional ones are very expensive. They're barely animated (move their arms and heads a 'bit'). Most of the bits which look like they might do something don't.... It's just too expensive for not much..."
1,"Cheaply made, flimsy, a total ripoff..","When there are over three times as many 1* reviews than those that are 5* for a product, you should know what you are letting yourself in for. Even the clearance price of $20 that I paid for this is not worth it. It doesn't sing any of the Oh Toodles or Hotdog jingles. The side door and slide do not ever stay attached. No other characters except Mickey are included for the (not insubstantial) price you are paying. There is not much in this toy that can hold a busy toddler's attention for any significant amount of time. Useless piece of junk by Disney."
2,My son loves it but shoddy craftsmanship,"My son loves this toy and plays with it still...over a year after receiving it.That said, we ended up giving it to him with the slide not attached and the shoe not attached. We threw those in the closet when we assembled it because they were poorly constructed and would not stay attached at all.As I said, since I put it together before my son saw it, I elected to just scrap those items and not let him know they existed and so he has been very happy with it all together though.The pop up items inside (especially the artist easel) stopped working after about 2 months or so, but everything other than those things noted work fine."
2,Poor quality overrides playability,"As the others have mentioned, the quality of this toy is very poor. The slide does not stay attached and neither does the yellow boot/door. The rear observatory also falls off and when it's opened, is not level and the characters slide off. It's a shame that it has so many problems, because it has the potential to be a really cute toy. I'm so glad I didn not pay more than the $40 retail price. Disney missed the mark on this one."
1,Very Unpleased!!!,"I have to agree with the other reviews, if only I had read them before I purchased this house. This house is poorly made, it truly was a waste of money. I had to pay 60 bucks for this thing, and nothing stays attached like the pretty picture on the front of the box. It really is pointless too, it doesn't do anything. For this newly restructured program to have been such a hit, I would have thought their toys would have been great. Think twice before you purchase!!!"
3,mixed review - but not great,"Ok - if my kids were giving the review ... they would probably give it 4 stars. My 2 & 4 year old love this toy. They watch Mickey's Clubhouse all the time and love it. Diego & Dora come to visit the clubhouse all the time.As a parent, it is not worth the price. It should be closer to $20 or 30. The slide & the shoe are attachments that never stay on. Although it is bigger than I thought it would be ( 1-1/2' high and 1' wide), there isn't much you can do with it. Fisher Price playsets are more intersting. The only character that comes with the set is Mickey Mouse ... there needs to be more characters.In conclusion, if your child REALLY loves Mickey's Clubhouse on tv AND you can find a good deal somewhere .... that is the only reason to purchase this toy. Otherwise it is a dissappointment."
1,Piece of Junk for the money - Kids are very frustrated by the toy.,"This thing is junk. If you don't buy all the extras it will do almost nothing interactive.The door falls off if your child picks it up or moves the house.The slide falls off if you even look at it funny.The engineer that designed this needs his butt kicked.Disney ought to refund all the money made from these.There ought to be a major false advertising and misleading lawsuit here.My two sons (4&5)were very excited to get it for Christmas. As soon as we opened it, put it together and started playing - it just fell apart.I assemble pecision machinery and fabricate equipment for a living. I'm not putting it together wrong - the design is just junk.I finally resorted to using ""JB Weld"" to hold the door and slide on.If your careful it can still look good, but for a $40 toy they can do better.Find a better toy for your children."
3,The kids like it...,"Our boys really enjoy the clubhouse, but they don't ever use the slide or the shoe door that it came with. They won't even stay on long enough to do anything with. We managed to find all the figures, so they enjoy them, but they don't bother using the talking bases they came with. They just use the figures like you would dolls in a dollhouse. The only other problem is that the door on Mickey's head pops off too easily and I keep putting it back on. I guess, all in all, it's not well made, but they enjoy it quite a bit and have played with it tons every single day since Christmas."
2,Mickey Mouse Clubhouse,"I was very underwelmed with the clubhouse. We gave it to our boys for Christmas and they actually love it, but I do not. The clubhouse is not very user friendly. The slide and the door do not attach well. In fact, we have not been able to get the slide to stay on at all. Also, we were surprised that the characters were so rigid. They do not bend to sit and only wiggle their arms. It surprises me that the clubhouse comes wih an easel and a table when none of the characters can use them!! Finally, the ""tootles"" and ""Mouskadoer"" are neat, but the telescope is missing. Overall, the boys love it because their favorite characters talk (only a few phrases), but for the money we spent, I wanted something to spark their imagination and something they could actually PLAY and grow with."
2,A real Disney downer,"Like others, I was very frustrated that the yellow ""foot"" door and blue slide do NOT stay on, especially for $40!! We've even tried unsuccessfully to glue it together. With the quality provided, this should have only been $15. Our Donald Duck is also barking sometimes... clearly some flaws in this product. I'd wait until they recall this one and come out with an improved version before you buy it. My 2.5 year old daughter does love it, but keeps crying when she tries to slide the guys down the slide. We've hidden the slide for now."
1,Very Disappointing!,"I wish I had read these reviews before I purchased the Mickey Mouse Clubhouse! Everything they say is true -- the instructions are virtually non-existent, the slide and the yellow shoe do NOT stay attached and it doesn't even play the the theme song! My two year old loves Mickey, and he had fun with it, even though he spent most of his time bringing me various pieces that had fallen off and asking me to put them back on. I just sent Disney a note to let them know how disappointing this product is, and that they should be ashamed for selling such a piece of junk!!"
1,Horrible!!!,"My son got this christmas morning and the slide does not stay on, as well as the shoe on the other side!!! Very disappointed. We are trying to talk our son into taking this back and getting some Diego things. It really is a piece of junk!!!! If only I could talk my son into letting us take this think back. We are going to keep trying!!!!!!!"
2,Slide doesn't stay on,"I am extremely disappointed in this item. It was supposed to be the ""hit"" present for my 20 month old on Christmas morning. Like the other reviews that I am reading, the slide DOES NOT stay on neither does that yellow side part. For the cost of this item and other figures, it is going back to the store for something better. My daughter loves the Mickey Mouse Club House t.v. show, and this could have been a great, exciting toy for her. I was really surprised at the lack of quality and only wish I had read other reviews before purchasing this item. Live and learn."
2,DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!,"I bought this for my daughter for Christmas and I was very disappointed! The instructions are terrible - I had to look on the box to find out where to put the stickers and I didn't know there was a secret ""door"" on the Mickey Mouse ears for a good 1/2 hour (I had an extra sticker left and couldn't figure out where it was supposed to go until my sister-in-law figured it out). The yellow door piece and the blue slide won't stay on at all. I just took both pieces away and my child doesn't miss them. The pop up ""trap door"" gets stuck and I have to put my fingernail under it to make it open. I feel that it is way overpriced for how it performs. It is cute, but not worth the price."
3,2 year old loves it but,I too am a little disappointed in the toy but my 2 year old loves it so thats whats most important. Her little people even visit the playhouse quite often. So from a kids perspective i would give it 4 stars. I paid only[...]$ at wallmart for it so i am glad i didn't pay[...]$. I mainly was disappointed in that the slide doesn't stay on (but i will take reviewers advice below and use the super glue). I thought the sounds are too loud almost ear piercing. I also agree two characters in the playset would have been nice. The characters are not cheap either if u want more.
1,"Too bad, it was a good idea....","The slide and shoe doesn't even stay attached. Also, only comes with one figurine and the remaining figurines are nowhere to be found in stores, you have to pay $20 each for them online. Doesn't play theme song either. This is probably the worst toy I've ever bought for my 3 year old. I was very disappointed considering it's a disney product."
2,I hate to agree...,"...but I had I same problems on Christmas morning. I was so excited about being able to find it and give it my son, and then I tried to put it together. Thank God, the figure works and he LOVES how the Mousekadooer lights up, but the slide is a real bummer. It doesn't stay on long enough to put Mickey down it! I also gave up on the doorway. I'm considering glueing the pieces on, but he seems to enjoy it without them at all. Disney duped us. How sad. On Christmas too."
3,It's somewhat fixable with glue! It's that a shame!,"I too am disappointed that Disney would produce something so cute yet terribly made. I haven't bought the figures yet, and I am thinking twice about doing so. MY ADVICE IF YOU ARE GOING TO KEEP IT,...purchase some Elmer's Ultimate glue. If you follow the directions on the bottle, it should do the trick. I braced the yellow tube with masking tape and let it set. Now, if my daughter sits on it, I may have to re-glue it. It is terrible to pay $40+ for this item and the piece not fit. Disney didn't even appear to try and make the yellow tube fit. I too am anxious to see if they recall it!! Until then, we just keep Elmer's close by. I am not about to rip it away from my 2 1/2 year old!"
2,Not very good quality...,"My son loves the Mickey Mouse clubhouse show, so he received this for Christmas. He plays with it very seldom and I think it's just a piece of junk. I'm sorry to be so harsh, but nothing stays together on this thing. You have to push the character's down so hard to get them to talk in their own voices that my 2 and a half year old son has a hard time with it. The characters don't really move much at all and I was just really disappointed with this thing. I would buy something made by one of the more reputable toy companies if I had it to do over again."
4,This is a great toy,This is a great toy. My 2 year old got this for her 2nd birthday. She continues to play with it all of the time. I would say she plays with this more than any of her other toys. The little characters are hard to find if you want variety. I took me almost 6 months to find a pluto or a Donald in a store. I found them online but they were expensive. I think if a store is going to carry these items they should carry a wide range of the product line offering everything this toy came with. It is a great toy even though some of the smaller pieces have fallen off. I didn't quite understand how the slide attaches or the shoe.. they do not attach in a fixed manner. I love Disney products. They are all made pretty well. I would along with my 2 year old give this toy a double thumbs up.
2,Very disappointed - especially for the price!,"One of our daughters just loves Mickey, so we were so excited to finally get this toy (it was out of stock at Christmas time). And what a complete disappointment it is.The animated Mickey is neat, but that is the only highlight of this toy, other than it is portable and lightweight. I'm sure if you invest in the other characters, you might get a few more minutes of playtime. The front of the house has two features that pop out - one of which is supposed to be a stove, which is at Mickey's feet. The slide and the ""foot"" come off easily, and the door at Mickey's head has fallen off a couple of times as well.I would highly suggest saving your money, or purchasing the Little People sets if you want play toys such as these."
1,I have a phone # for Characters Direct,My three year old really wanted this for Christmas so of course her grandparents bought her the Clubhouse and all of the characters. We have also had problems with the slide and door and some of the characters. The light switch on the inside does not do anything and we can't figure out if it is supposed to. The manufacturer can't answer that question either. So if anyone can let me know if theirs does anything I would appreciate it. We taped the slide on for now. I found a phone # for Characters Direct on the instructions that came with the characters. They do not have replacement parts yet but are talking info so they can contact you when the parts come in. They understand that the slides and the doors are a problem. Their # is 866-652-6375. Good Luck!!! I think there should be a recall on this toy but I doubt that will happen.
4,"Much, Much, Much better than expected","I almost did not buy this based on some of the negative reviews but ultimately my daughter's unequivocal zeal for the MM Clubhouse show made be take the leap of faith. Expecting the worst, I unpackaged it tonight and was very pleasnantly suprised by the quality. The foot/doorway and slide issues are really quite marginal and, overall, it is a very well-executed toy. When you consider how much the imagination of a toddler adds to the equation, I think there is plenty here to faciliate many, many hours of fun."
3,MM Clubhouse,"My Daughter (2 years old) loves Mickey mouse and this clubhouse. She's able to play with even if she can't use it to it's fullest capacity. My complaint's is that the slide never stays on for more than 2 minutes, which is only about 2 minutes less than the boot. Also the characters don't make the noises they are supposed to make from all the places they are supposed to. My recommendation is if your kids love the Mickey Mouse Clubhouse show this will be a big hit, but don't expect much."
2,Waste of Money,"We searched and searched for this clubhouse because we thought our daughter would love it. She loves the interactive characters and that is about it. The slide and foot come off so easily so it's a complete waste to even have them, just more pieces to clean up. It was totally not what we expected especially after paying $40 for it and it being a Disney product. We were very disappointed. Don't waste your money, you can have mine!"
2,Way too flimsy for the price!,"Very cute toy, however.......Every time my 3 year old even looks at it the slide falls off, the yellow door falls off & the black door on Mickey's head falls off. Cute but very disappointed in the quality!"
2,Daughter likes it but is is so poorly made,"My daughter was so excited to open this for her birthday. I was lucky enough to pay the regular store price for the clubhouse, had to pay extra for the figures on ebay. Considering my daughter had been pretending an old carebear house was mickey's clubhouse, this was a step up in appearance.I don't see why this toy was so expensive. My daughter who was 3 kept asking why doesn't the kutchen pop up and why isn't there a telescope out of the ears? They cretianly could have made more features. Plus as others have noted the slide and yellow door don't stay on at all.I had to give this 2 stars because my daughter loves it but it is a frustrating toy for a parent and totally overpriced."
2,"Wow, I share the same opinion!!","I usually don't write reviews, but I have been searching for the phone number to reach the company, Characters Direct, LTD, the manufacturer of the mickey mouse clubhouse. I too, paid more for it on ebay, because it was not anywhere to be found. My daughter loves it, but the workmanship is junk. Minnie is missing screws in her head, which keeps falling off. As others noted, the yellow door and the slide do not stay on. Thank goodness my two year old doesn't notice that stuff. The idea is neat. I look at the talking bases as a bonus, for she barely uses them and yes unless you have the original characters on the accompanying base, they only say one sentence. Overall, I too am disappointed. I am still searching for the contact for characters direct, trying to get screws for minnie's head and glue for the slide."
2,At least the kids love it.,"I would give it 0 stars if my kids didn't love it. I got it for my 2 year old for x-mas and my 4 year old plays with it just as much as he does, which is every day so far. Like most people, I couldn't find it anywhere except on EBAY, so I paid more then retail. Normally I don't mind, but the club house is so poorly made/put together that it isn't worth the retail cost, no less what I paid. It's bascically a peice of junk in my opinion, and like previous reviewers, I excpected much more from Disney. The characters only say one phrase unless you keep them on ""their own base"", the club house it's self doesn't do anything that interesting. Over all I'd say it stinks, but again the kids love it. So at least I'm getting my money's worth that way."
1,Horrible Toy,"I was happy to locate this toy for my son even though I had to pay an exhorbitant price. WHAT A DISAPPOINTMENT. Falls apart, does nothing special, no instructions to let you know what ""talks"", etc. - only a few phrases, impossible to find additional figures - just a worthless piece of junk! My son has barely opened it since Christmas day - money down the drain!"
3,Not as great as I expected,"This toy is definitely not as durable as I would have liked. My son does like the interactive characters a lot. But we both find it frustrating that they don't fit through the door. The slide doesn't stay on that well, but we make it work. I bought mine through EToys, I had a problem with the first clubhouse I received and they were easy to deal with in getting a replacement. So I do recommend ordering from them."
2,Returned the clubhouse and got her the counting car,"WE waited for months for find the clubhouse. I was so excited, had not read the comments. when we put it together we were so upset with it. My 22 month old was getting so frustrated everything she would push Mickey down the slide it would come apart. the door is hard to open the side door would also come off. We took it back and got the car. Its on $[...], counts and works- We are still looking for the rest of the figures, can not believe that they are so hard to come by."
2,Unsatisfactory book!,"More than a book this is a sort of personal show of the author.The book is quite useless to gain real knoweldge in the microwave engineering area.The developement of subjects is unsatisfactory because many times Mr Liao shows to you final formulas without saying much of the related derivations.The general impression is that the book tries to show too many things without really explaining anything.For a solid introduction to the microwave engineering area try instead ""Microwave Engineering"" by Pozar.2 stars!"
4,Microwave Devices and Circuits by Samuel Y. Liao,"Are you kitting. This is one of the best Practical book you ever have.Get one, if you're working in this field..."
4,very moving story and a great study,"Do not be turned off by this book because it is written by an academic. It is one of the most moving books I have read in a long time. In toronto, where Philipino nannies work for many families, the book's topics are acute and relevant. The book tells a story of extremely educated women, elite in their society, who take up domestic work in the West in order to provide their children and parents with better opportunities. The book will make you re-think many things that families in the West take for granted, such as being able to sleep under the same roof with their children, and being able to provide for them at the same time."
2,too short lifetime,"Similar Apacer memory stick (4GB, same casing) was in use as ReadyBoost stick and died in about a year without any forewarning. No computer will even recognize it being connected anymore."
2,Two Down :-(,"I've had two of these drives. The first failed within sixty days and never worked again, even with Apacer's low-level formatting tool. The second drive stopped working as a ReadyBoost drive after a year of use.If these drives worked reliably they'd be five stars, no question."
1,It's no good,"it messed up my phone (samsung t-809) it doesn't remember what I put on it. So I have to take the card out, put it back in and then remake my playlist every time I want to listen to music. I really don't like it."
3,Watch out on pricing for this one!,"Amazon currently has this listed for $29.92 and here it's $16.79. However, look at the shipping policies for this vendor. It is $5.95 for one item and then another $7 for 1-3 day 'expedited'.If you've got Amazon Prime you'll get the full retail package for an extra 23 cents instead of what I assume is an OEM white box package (is that what ""Bulk"" means in the product title?).I don't know for sure if this is going to work in my BlackBerry Pearl. All indications say it will but I'd rather take Amazon's no quibble returns than trying to figure out how to send it back to somebody I've never done business with before.Watch out for shipping sometimes. It really bumps up the price of something that appears to be a deal."
1,1GB Sandisk MicroSD TransFlash Memory Card,"The flash card load my music but it wouldn't play on my VX8500 Chocolate phone, sorry it doesn't work on my phone. I even tried to use it on my brother white chocolate and it still doesn't work. But when I tried using his that he got from the Verizon store it works completely fine."
5,SanDisk MicroSD (used in LG CU500 phone),"Loaded with zero problems..(I have 2 phones, only loaded 1 so far.)Used Windows 10.0 to load 261 songs, absorbing 864kb, leaving 127kb freefor other uses.... By the way, the CU500 is Great !"
5,Great Memory Card!!,"This really boosted my LG mp3 phone. I currently have nearly 200 songs on the memory card, with memory to spare!!!"
5,Excellent,"Excellent product, I have not had problem of mutual incompatibility when using it in my cellular one, PC or digital camera. I recommend it."
5,Worked perfectly,Ordered this on Amazon and installed today in my Garmin i2 StreetPilot and was able to load the entire US onto it instead of having to choose just a few states at a time.
5,A great bargain!,My order came quickly and was considerably less expensive than buying this item just about anywhere else. Works great!
3,"great deal, but...","i wasn't aware that i'd have to buy another item for it to work with my computer (Sony VAIO-SZ390). still, it was a great deal and arrived quickly!"
5,Excellent price.,I don't see why we should buy the retail package. You don't need a manual to use a microSD card. Insert the card into the reader. Insert the reader into the microSD slot of your computer and that's it.
4,good card with easy management,"adding items onto this card is as easy as drag and drop. for those who enjoy huge photo albums and extensive music collections, I'd recommend the 2gb card, as 1gb doesn't offer much space."
4,"Big power, Little package",It is amazing how much memory can be squeezed into such a small data card.
5,Smaller than a fingernail and pretty good too..,"I got this item last year for my brand new Nokia cell phone. It was my first attempt at enjoying the convenience of digital music from my cell phone.I was impressed with how small the memory card was; at the same time, I was pleased with how much music the thing could contain. I've still only only used about 20% of its capacity..and that is with music and photos.Overall the SanDisk card has also been very reliable. No problems with loss data or any such thing. Very pleased with the item and highly recommend it."
5,Fantastic,this is a great little card. I use it in both my LG VX8500 and the Wii using the included adapter. So far it hasn't given me any problems and is very fast when transferring files to my computer.
5,Sandisk - Only one that works with LG CU500,"For mobile phone choice, my daughter wanted the Cingular LG CU500 while my son opted for the Cingular Sync (Samsung 707). Both units use MicroSD cards for storing MP3s and other stuff. I looked and found the best price for 2 Kingston Cards and bought them. However, when they arrived, the CU500 would not read the Kingston while the Sync had no problems. I checked all the blogs and read that the LG CU500 was finicky and needed the SanDisk. I found it hard to believe but went ahead and ordered this SanDisk. When it arrived, I was surprised to find out that indeed, it worked fine while the Kingston did not. I am glad they come with adapters so I can use the Kingston as a SecureSD as well. Buy this one if you have an LG CU500."
4,"Great card, especially for the price!","I recently bought a new phone w/MP3 capabilities that I couldn't wait to use. But the memory of the phone itself is dinky, so I knew I needed more memory. I originally went to Target where I did find a microSD 1 GB card for 49.98, but I decided not to purchase it. Instead, I went on Amazon. I was so glad I didn't purchase the one at Target, b/c this one works perfectly for my phone and is a lot less expensive. I haven't had any issues at all w/it--I use it w/my LG VX8500 and my husband got one for his LG VX8300. I gave it a 4 of 5 b/c it doesn't come w/any info--it being bulk packaging and all."
3,SanDisk MicroSD,"It's ok. I bought it to use with my New Chocolate Phone, and I found that I needed to buy the kit to transfer music to the card because you could not sync music to the disk. But overall its cool because i have around 200 songs on it :)"
5,Works great,"Works great, transfer data at a good speed. I've had no problems with this adaptor at all. Good price, great value."
5,Cheap and it worsk,"Good price, good shipping. It holds a lot of pictures. Don't know what else to say, it is a working SD card."
5,SanDisk MicroSD Memory Card,Delivery was very quick and the card works perfectly. We now have 4 cards and all are working well. I would highly recommend this product.
5,Been Working Great,I've owned it for 8 months and it has worked great in my phone and in my cars deck via USB.
4,Good buy,Works like a charm w/my phone. I'm able to store pics and music w/out the hassle of buying ringtones!
5,One Gig of Heaven,This one gig sandisk memory card has allowed me to turn my phone into a music machine. Its song capabilities are amazing provided you have the right phone to use this memory card with. I am very satisfied with how easy it is to transfer songs and files from my phone to my computer through the use of the adapter. Great product and I highly recommend it!
4,1GB Sandisk MicroSD TransFlash Memory Card,This 1GB Sandisk MicroSD TransFlash Memory Card WORKSGreat ! with my LG VX 8300 Cell phone.... Great Price too.- Hecnet
4,Memory card,I received the 3 cards ahead of estemated delivery. Packing was in good condition.All cards worked and were in new condition.
5,worked fine,I purchased this item for my cellphone cause I lost my other one. Great product at a very great price!
4,Great small 1GB card,"I needed to find a microSD card that was < 2GB in size for a small arduino based board I am working on (Card needed to adhere to SPI protocol) I think this card may work (works fine in computer, came formatted FAT16), but I havn't gotten it to work for Raw read and write yet. I'll update this if/ when I do.This seller charges ~$2-3 for shipping for each item, so if you wanted to buy 3 of these cards, they would charge you ~$9 for shipping, which is frankly a rip-off."
5,Works Just like any 1GB SD Card Should!,"What More Can I Say? Item Arrived Quickly, Packed Well In Bulk Packaging But Well Worth It For The Price Difference. Why Buy Anything Less Than SanDisk For The Price?"

4,car,"my 2 year old LOVES cars and mickey mouse. but he loves matchbox cars...so this doesn't get played with as much as i thought and hoped it would. I think it's too big for him, but it is very cute how it counts and talks."
1,Returned - REALLY annoying,"Your child may like this toy a lot, but adults will quickly hate it. It has a really shrill voice, is quite loud, has no volume switch and no off button. Parents beware!"
4,For 17 year old - no complaints,"Sorry - no feedback from our 17 year old son - it's related to school. So no news, is good news!"
5,Great price on Amazon!,"The first time I paid way to much to get one of these calculators for my son when he needed one. This time, when my daughter needed one I went on Amazon and got a used one in great condition for half! Thanks Amazon! It a great calculator and a necessity if you or your kids are taking ALgebra courses or above!"
4,paper saver,needed this item to replace one that was taken from my daughters locker at school. sooo much easier to help with her homework. recommending to other high school parents.wendy
4,It was expensive for a TI-83,"This calculator was the same price as the T-84 plus and I find that surprising. I meant to buy a used calculator twice but I just could not figure it out. Although , I found it kind of expensive it is very easy to use and has a very helpful instructions attached. I just wish it had a usb port attached at the tip of it."
3,TI83 Calculator,Works well but came with no instruction manual. Good to keep even after completing business calculus for other functions in college algebra.
1,Review,The T83 graphing calculator was in pretty good condition but when I use the calculator after a couple of problems the screen blurrs and I have to turn it off. I was told it was in really good condition and worked great.. It did not
5,Great,The calculator was in great shape and the shipment was as fast as advertised. I would recommend this product to anyone. Thanks!
2,screen did not work,"The calculator came in on time which was nice, and the screen didn't look like it was cracked... but when I turns it on for class I can't see the two bottom lines, which on a graphing calculator is pretty difficult to work around"
2,Not what I bought,I bought this through Amazon looking to replace a calculator quickly after losing mine before the end of the semester and thought it would be cool to get a green one. Instead I received a black one... but now I'm stuck with it because finals have begun T_T;
1,I hate it!,It does not work at all. I hate it so much. THe buttons donot even move I dont know who would sell such property to people
5,Sparkly silver calulator,The calculator arrived very quickly and is in great shape (so is the cover). I put batteries in and it works great.
3,It was OK...not great,"I did enjoy all 4 women and how they met and developed friendships, I had a hard time occasionally keeping each one straight. Also, there were parts of the book that I thought were not needed -- a whole section on how to play golf and another on local government? It seemed a little more than what the plot required and I found myself skipping whole sections. I also felt the book ended rather abruptly. I've enjoyed other books by this author, but wasn't a big fan of this one."
3,Good read--but better without the proselytizing,"Speaking as an Air Force wife, I can see some dated elements in the book, but, overall, I believe it presents the friendships that can easily grow between women who have nothing else in common but the fact that they're ""trailing spouses"" (aka ""dependents"").Other than the book ending rather abruptly, the only thing that would keep me from recommending it widely is its rather heavy-handed anti-Mormon thread. I would have been happy to recommend it to all the new spouses I meet if it had simply relied on the women's discovering or rediscovering their own faiths, rather than attempting to disprove another religion. (Would those of you who gave it five stars have liked it as well if Karen had been Jewish or Muslim, rather than Mormon?) As is, I would be cautious recommending it to anyone who wasn't a conservative/evangelical Christian."
5,Couldn't put this book down!,"I read this book in 8 days, it was so enjoyable. It was very true to life, as I am a military wife I can understand the characters and what they are going through. For anyone who wants to find out what military life can be about read this book."
5,Outstanding source of intersting problems in number theory,Another of my 10 favorite books. A constant source of inspiration
2,opinion of game,It was a very difficult game to do. Most of the time I like Tony Hawks Games. The graphics were good.
4,A good portable verion of Tony Hawk!,If your into the Tony Hawk skating games this is your best bet for a hand held system. Feels and plays like the PS2 version and is overall a decent game.
4,Playful Game,"It's not what I expected, but I'm not a skateboarder. So, I just play this game to feel like one. Although, it's a game that I am getting used to. I have the one in PS2, and it's fun to skate on rails, rooftops, powerlines, etc. Too bad can't do that in the real world. The first Tony Hawk: Underground was okay and I got that one too. I'm not far from the level that I'm on either one of them. But it's fun to play as a skateboarder, which makes you feel like one although not."
4,awesome game,tony hawk rules all his games rock and the psp version rules too a must have for all tony hawk fans awesome game
1,What are you thinking..this sucks!!,"Let me get to the bottom line, this game sucks. Same game as tony hawk underground 2 but with just 4 new levels. Controls suck and are hard. this game is a no-no..."
5,Excellent quality part for a great price.,"I bought this to replace the entire water pump assembly on my daughter's car - which was leaking after 160k miles. One of the major advantages of buying this part is it comes with everything you need - already sealed and ready to go. Item comes with all the hoses, so that saves time and money - too. Anyone that has replaced a water pump knows that the old hoses will not ever come off with ease, so they end up getting destroyed and need to be replaced.Once I managed to get the part installed in her car (which wasn't easy due to the small space I was working with), it is working perfectly. This is also a real Motorcraft part - not some unknown OEM part.Great part, great deal!"
5,An excellent choice,"This is an excellent choice for a replacement water pump. Because you are getting the whole thing, you do not need to worry about getting the seal right. And the price was marginally more than some of the pumps on sale that had only the half with the pump blade."
4,Perfect Fit,This drainer is a perfect fit for my sink. It is small but I seldom need any more space for draining my dishes.
5,Perfect for my college dorm,I love this little Dish Drainer- it's perfect for holding my few dishes in my college dorm. It is compact but can hold a surprising amount.
5,perfect for a small recreational vehicle,"We got this for our new pop-up truck camper, where counter and storage space are both very tight. It is large enough for a meal or two of dishes - mostly smaller than average size. Just be sure to locate the drain hole over the edge of the sink or the counter will flood. For stowing during transit the sponge, detergent etc go inside the basket and the base snaps onto the top."
4,"Well-made, but...","I bought this when I moved into a studio cottage with a very small kitchen. It is well-made, but when you put glasses over the ""spikes"" on the outside, the water drains onto the counter because the tray is so small. You can tell by the picture, but I didn't realize it until I used it."
4,Can't live without it,"I use this in our travel trailer. It's a good fit on the counter, but the stand needs to be a bit taller to be able to slope the water toward the sink, so I end up propping the end up a bit. I don't use it for storing since it's an open grate on the bottom and don't want to chance spilling any detergent or soap during transit."
5,Dish Drainer,"This dish drainer works great, it fits right into the sink and I can even put the sink cover over it."
5,Mini Dish Drainer,"My family does alot of camping and I bought 3 of these one for daughter, one for daughter in law and one for myself we all use them and find it useful in several different ways"
4,Nice for small RV sinks,"I wanted a strainer that would fit in the smaller of the two sinks in my TT. The smaller being only 8"" x 13"". The lips of this hang on the sides of the sink but that works well. The cover becomes a tray for drainage if you perfer to use it on a counter top. The lid snaps firmly shut allowing for storage of items inside for travel. Not perfect, but all in all it works well."
1,Not as shown!,"It came with different trucks than shown. My son was excited to get ""the stairs-truck"" but instead there was some other stupid truck!"
3,No steps truck in the set,"I ordered one of these but apparently newer sets don't include the steps truck. Only the airplane, a bus and a catering car. I especially ordered this because of the special truck you can't get anywhere else. I'm disappointed."
2,Very tiny !!,Ordered these as a perfect match to a necklace my husband bought me but when i opened the pkg. I absolutely could not believe how small these are !! I have medium length hair but if I dont pull it up you would never see these teenie tiny earrings hanging from the ear.. very dissapointed !!
4,Beautiful music,"Flowers is a beautiful piece of work. Thanks to a satellite music channel, I was made aware of Kevin Kendle's talent. ""Sunflowers""--from this album--was the composition that grabbed my attention; I have never heard anything like it. Not only am I interested in music that pleases me, but I am also attracted to music that is distinctive and that I can feel a personal connection to. Kendle's music fits that bill. A word that I can use to characterize Flowers is pure--this is a word that I also use to describe classical music. Other words to describe this remarkable album are ethereal, natural, floating, serene, rich, relaxing, therapeutic, and gentle. Flowers was released in 2001, and eight tracks are contained. These pieces contain no vocals and minimal percussion. I find every one of the compositions to be gratifying and have no favorites. In addition, the album's sound quality is nice. The disc is just over 61 minutes. Flowers is one of my favorite albums, and I recommend it."
3,Disappointed,"This book has good intentions, but I found it difficult to read, and too academic in style. This book is a collection of essays, and some are on unimpressive subjects. It's an ok read at best."
4,Informative and Authoritative,"This is a terrific book that really covers the best and the brightest of Italian culture.You'll read about St. Thomas Aquinus, the Roman Empire, Dante, and of course Leonardo Da Vinci. It not only discusses the people, and the events, but what they thought and how they thought it.As this is a very scholarly book, although this can be a bit difficult at times to get through, in the end you will learn a lot about Italian history and influence."
3,"Dense, Limited and Misses the Mark","I got this as a gift but found the style to be dense and at times irrelevant. The genius in chapter 22 is titled ""Sigismondo Malatesta: The condottierre with a vision"" huh ? And Chapter 28 is about a self-promoting pornographer called Aretino. huh? There are some good chapters on people like Da Vince and Galileo, but the book looks BACK into history and does not account for modern Italians in any real way except for a chapter on Fermi and one on Ferrari. But why Ferrari and why not Ferrucio Lamborghini or the founders of Fiat or Lancia. The book misses too many items and seems out of focus at times. An OK read at best."
2,13 in Chinese chopping block,"I was looking for a very good size chopping block, and I found one on Amazon. After the chopping block arrived, I was so disappointed to see that the chopping block did not have a smooth chopping surface as I expected. And it cracked all over within the first week of arrival. I used the oil that came with it, I put it in water for two weeks, and it still cracked. It has been in my garage since. I would not recommend anybody to buy this chopping block. It is expensive, and can't even use it, not even once. J-U-N-K!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
5,"Priceless look into Ana Nez's Cherokee ""wild pharmacy""","A great book for natural healing enthusiasts, focusing on the medicinal plants used by Native Americans, the science surrounding them, and tips, photos and maps for finding, identifying anp preparing them."
5,Lovely,I really loved this novel! From the start you were pulled into the plot as if you were there with each character and my favorite part has to be when Hannah falls a sleep and wakes up with an ink stain on her face and then Dante's reaction to it. This book is definetly worth keeping on the bedside table for a future read or re-read. Enjoy!
4,Local Dinner Guests,A good resource for learning about the birds at your feeder. It is not as comprehensive but is certainly a good aid in learning who your dinner guests are!
3,Birds calls,The book was fine and received promptly and in a nice set with the CD. But the CD had a lot of skips in it.
5,Easy to use and shows both male and female!,"This book is unique because it shows pictures of both the male and female of each breed (and the youth if it has different markings). It's coded by the primary color of the bird, so most of the breeds are listed twice (once for the duller colorings of the female and once for the more vivid male). You don't have to guess which birds are pairs anymore, because they show side by side on the same page."
5,Nice Pocket Book,Very nice pocket book with clear pictures of each bird. I always have it available when the birds are around the feeder and can clearly find what I'm looking for.
5,Bevo's Bible,Got the reference book for my girlfriend Bevo who's a real bird enthusiast here in Bradford County. She's used it often and we're surprised by the many different species she's been able to identify. Sometimes she shows the birds her hiney
5,Excellent Material,"This is an excellent box set, probably the best one I have ever heard. The sound quality is also quite excellent, especially on the very early tracks. I also liked the rare tracks that were put on this disk, it is a very nice touch.Highly Recommended."
1,A how-to book that gives no information about MVPS,"What a disappointment. As it turns out, this author has done many ""how-to"" books with little depth or understanding of the disease. To me, it was obvious that he knows little to nothing about MVPS. There are global statements with no medical references. I'm sorry I wasted my money. Disappointed reader."
1,Skip this book,"If you are looking for good information on MVPS, DON'T get this book. It is written for the author himself to read. Websites like MVPSupport.com offer more information than this book"
5,Awakening the mind,An excellent book to entrain distinct brain wave predominance. This will provide a frame work for which progress can be assessed by EEG technology.
2,Vague and unhelpful.,"I am a reader of manhy books on meditation as well with an interest in brain-waves neurofeedback etc.Throughtout this book there is a constant reference to the ""awakened mind"" pattern, but what it is remains not only vague but unreferenced- she claims this is the patterns of ""masters"" that her teacher (M. Cade) collected his data from; yet modern research clearly shows different meditations - produce difference brainwave patterns. Also, what exactly quality to her as a ""master"" remains unknown.I find it lacking some traditional or at least philosophical framework with which to place the multitude of meditations suggested; the fact it is associated with some 'brainwave' is too abstract to convince one to practice these sincerely.For meditation, I suggest looking at Adyashanti, or Shambhala materials. For engaging writing on brain-states and waves,The Head Trip: Adventures on the Wheel of Consciousness, which is more up-to-date as well."
1,Horrible Stereotype!,"Frank is stereotyping Muslims when he writes about Sonia wanting to be a ""good muslim girl"". Muslims can talk to boys, people outside of their religion, plus he has mixed up muslims with another religion by the saying that she cannot cut her hair. As I read that chapter I was hurt, offended and extremely mad. This is a perfect example of how horrible stereotypes truly are. Sonia isn't even a Muslim name. It doesn't even say why she has these rules, he should do more research on a religion before writing about it!"
4,Frank's Life is Funny should be read by parents first,"Frank's Life is Funny is well written and certainly represents a particular slice of life in an exact and honest way. As a school librarian, however, I am concerned that many reviewers have recommended this book for grades 7 and up. A parent complained that this book was too mature for her 10th grader, when that is the level at which I would place this book. While it is easy to read, the graphic language and descriptions may be best suited for high school students. I do believe that this book belongs in libraries, but I would caution parents to read the book and open up meaningful dialogs with their children."
5,Because Life is Funny,"Life is Funny is probably the best book for teens on earth. An excellent premire novel from E.R. Frank, Life Is Funny follows eleven teens lives, how each has their own problem, and their own way of resolution. The best stories are those of Gingerbread and Keisha, Eric, Mickey and Linette, Sonia, and Drew. The slang, though fairly dated, rings tough and contemporary, and teen romance is perfectly hit, whether its good or bad. The best thing about Life is Funny is that each story, no matter how serious or tragic, is lined with humor, and the story changes when you switch to a diffrent personality. Evreyone looks on each other thinking their the most troubled, but really they all are"
1,Is there a lower rating than 1 star?????,"I think this book is AWFUL. I teach an afterschool English Language Arts program for inner city African American students. I found this book after searching for contemporary titles my students could relate to. And while it's true the characters are raw, edgy and some could be taken straight from my classroom, this books serves no higher purpose than illustrating the character's stuggles and frustrations. My students don't need illustration on how awful life is, they live it every day. They need ways to cope with what's happening in their lives and something to inspire them. I'm thankful I read the book before I decided to read it to my students, which will never happen."
5,Enlightened Text,This 16th Karmapa wanted this text to be the first translated from Tibetan to English. It is easy to see why he considered this text so important. It is an excellent meditation manual and exposition of Buddhism in the Tibetan Tradition. The various topics outlined are reinforced with a myriad of quotations from the sutras and the tantras. I think many people would highly recommend this text for a serious examination of a powerful Buddhist perspective. A wonderful retreat manual!
1,If you are ok receiving an open box,"The product itself works. But the item was previously opened. The plastic casing was cut with a knife from both sides. Since I had ordered exact same cable (but of Blue color) in the same order, I could compare both the boxes. The other Blue cable box is brand new. I'm certainly disappointed with this purchase."
4,A cable's a cable right?,"Some would say yes and some would say no. This cable however has worked out perfectly for my situation, which is a Home Recording Studio. I bought 2 to run to and from my interface to my drum module and keyboard. There really isn't too much to say, the ends are made solid, its a no frills cable that works."
5,It works! Nice sturdy cable.,I use this cable to connect my old circa 1980's keyboard to my computer and it works just fine! Like totally awesome dude!
2,not quality,"Because this is the only brand of midi cable offered by the local music stores, I've probably bought 15-20 of these at different lengths. I consider them disposable because I've never had one function properly for much more than a year and most of them much less than that. Depending on what u use it for I suppose sending a bad signal here and there may or may not be a big deal. When I use a midi cable between my keyboard and my vocal fx unit, malfunctioning can wreck a live show (triggering wrong harmonies, changing settings randomly, crashing the unit, etc.) Maybe they work fine if you never move them or use them live, but I really have tried babying them and still always end up throwing them out. If you're a pro musician, spend the money on quality cables."
3,A Pack of Newport-Lights,"Despite the potential of the interesting subject matter, 18 private homes and their gardens, PRIVATE NEWPORT is light on details. Author/flower-arranging judge Bettie Bearden Pardee treats it more like a cocktail party of a book with some name-dropping and a few anecdotal stories. Every property is architecturally significant with some fine furnishings and an interesting history, but do not count on much more than just small talk here. Photographer Mick Hales does a better job of presenting the substantial homes, not the so-called cottages of the Gilded Age but mansions none-the-less. All the photos are color and appear to be taken expressly for the book. In addition to an Introduction and an Index, there is a Forward by Marion Oates Charles. Best for those who already love Newport, one of the lovliest towns in the U.S."
5,A great book about Newport,I used to live in Newport and I recognize many of the houses in this book. You will not see these private interiors and gardens any other way. The photography and writing are excellent.
2,Dog Chewed corners,I was disappointed in the condition of the book I received. The corners of the book appeared to have been chewed by a dog possibly. This was to be a coffee table book. The book cover was also folded back.
5,"Wonderful collection of ""Hard to Find"" tunes!","The Dick Bartley ""One Hit Wonders"" series has a lot more than one thing going for it. These discs feature a wide variety of music that placed on the Top 100 Charts during the 1960s. Volume One features classic vocals like the Wee Five's ""You Were On My Mind"", the lesser known but much better Barry & the Tamerlanes ""I Wonder What She's Doing Tonight"" (as opposed to the Tommy Boyce/Bobby Hart single of the same name), and Joey Powers' ""Meet Me At Midnight, Mary."" There are also popular instrumentals like David Rose's ""The Stripper"", Kai Winding's ""More"" and the beautiful ""Cast Your Fate to the Wind.""As with any Rhino collection, the mastering is superb and the sound magnificent. Yes, I only gave it five stars, but this disc (and the one's that followed in the series) rates enough stars to fill a small galaxy. Don't miss it!"
3,One Hit Wonders,"I got the couple of songs that I was looking for and quite a few I didn't, but I knew that when I bought it. No problem."
3,Hard to find songs,I was only after one particular song on this cd but found I enjoyed about 4 others songs on it.It doesnt have a lot of songs on it but most are good easy listening.I would look at other volumes in this series.
1,Inaccurate novel,"A stupid, inaccurate novel about an imaginary character based on the name, ""Mickey Free."" Mickey Free was a very interesting person who led a facinating life. A pity the author felt forced to create an entirely different life to portray in this book."
1,More pseudo historical junk,"A novel typical of many modern westerns, more interested in creating a politically correct image of frontier life in the minds of readers than to give readers an idea of what things were really like. Mickey Free was a real person. He was born Felix Ward, and was violently kidnapped from his family ranch by people we today would call terrorists. He had no familial relationship with Geronimo (Golkayeh) or Chato or any other Chiricaua. He did spend a lot of time with some White Mountain Apache bands, after coming to live among them after his captors traded him off as if he were livestock. He shared the White Mountain Apache loathing of the Chiricaua. As an adult he was an enemy of the Chiricaua because of his treatment at their hands, and the great motivation for him to scout for the Army was for revenge.I would not recommend this novel to anyone who is truly interested in what life was like in the southwestern frontier."
2,Rubbermaid mop,I am very unhappy with this product. The sponge fell out of the roller and I can't get it back in. It is a waste of $35.00.
1,All New Stereo Recordings,"10 tracks, 27 minutes. Re-records and universally bad. Thin sounding, uninviting and minimal effort.Donovan; (born Donovan Philips Leitch, 10 May 1946 - ) is still in good voice and one can still enjoy listening to. Arrangement here is off.Freddy and the Dreamers lead singer; (Freddie Garrity (14 November 1936 - 19 May 2006) had a wonderful voice. He sounded terrific even here. The supporting band much less so.Gerry and the Pacemakers lead singer; (Gerard 'Gerry' Marsden (24 September 1942 - ) still has a great set of pipes and excellent here. Again the backing band is not up to the task.The 10 track were number 1's hits in England and monster hits in the USA but nothing here is close to the original tunes and pretty forgettable."
1,Eye shimmer should not come from a slime layer!,"I try just about every new fangled skin/makeup/cleanser, and I definitely gave these guys a fair shot...The shot went foul...It left a film on my skin that felt like I had put an anti-frizz hair product on my face by accident...I smells awful too...I was bad enough that after a week of use, my husband finally asked me if I was coming down with something and covering it up with makeup!Don't believe the hype!This stuff is shimmery crud!"
2,Inflated Price,"This paper-slot top to the Slim Jim recycling container fits the description. Nothing is else positive about this product, especially the price, which at $30 is ridiculous! It doesn't even snap on the top of the container; it is just held in place by the lid's overlapping edges. I give this two stars because I believe the inflated price is a big negative factor. Please comment if there is a generic brand lid available that fit Slim Jim 3540, 3541, 3554 containers."
2,Wanders in circles and then just dies,"This movie was done on a budget and shows it, but that is not it's main problem. As is so often the case, even with big budget films, the writing was not up to the task. The story was only crudely thought out, the pacing was very poor, and a number of times you felt like you must have missed a scene. Not that the author was deliberately jumping back and forth in time, that he messed up and completely left something out."
1,Not Worth Your Time Much Less Money,"I love a good B movie, but this low budget crap deserves a D. It's incredibly short, the plot is totally transparent and boring, and even the makeup is bad. Sometimes people should pay audiences to put up with this kind of thing."
2,disjointed,This really did not make much sense I think they could have developed the characters more. I didn't care when they died.
1,Terrible,"I could not watch past ten minutes of this garbage. It is a terrible stupid movie, and not the enjoyable kind of terrible and stupid. Don't bother with it. Seriously."
3,Very Pale,"The table is nice, BUT beware; if you're looking for something that truly looks like oak (even light oak), be prepared to refinish this table to get some color. It's very pale, and appears to be unfinished. I had gotten three other smaller tables (same style) elsewhere, and all I had to do was put them together. While I like the style, if I had it to do over again, I'd pay a bit more and get something I didn't have to work so hard on to get it to fit in with my other furniture. Because it was so heavy, shipping costs to return it were prohibitive."
3,Once you make it through the installation it works.,"I was really irritated to find that in one part of the directions it said you needed a 1 1/2"" fitting, then in another it says the pump outlet is 1"", yet it's actually 1 1/4"". So it took me twice as many trips to the hardware store as it should have, not to mention the fact that 1 1/4"" is an odd size so it's harder to find the fittings to adapt to a standard 1 1/2"" drain. Then, the ball valve that it comes with is absolute crap, it cracked while I was threading it on, before it was even snug. I noticed after removing it that the mold was incomplete so the wall was thinner on one side, and those things aren't cheap to go buy a new one. Other than that it works, now that it's in there. Kicks on when there's about 3"" of water in the sink, and keeps up with the faucet until the water is turned off then it finishes draining the sink."
3,"After glitches, seems OK.","First off, the fittings are 1-1/4"", not the 1-1/2"" the description and instructions call for. I was forewarned about that by another review, so was ready. Then, at first, the pump would not run. It just hummed. I had to manually get it going for a while, but it now seems to start on it's own every time, as if it needed to ""break in"". As long as it keeps running on it's own, I have to say it does the job. I use it on a laundry tub to pump washing machine discharge water up to septic level, about a 6 foot head. The washer gets a head start, but once the pump gets going, the tub is never more than 1/2 full. It then drains the tub to about 1"" of water remaining, which stays there."
3,Down the drain,A very good inexpensive alternative to a tank type sump pump for a basement sink below the drain line.
2,Pump does not work,"This pump was easy to install but does not work well. It turns on as soon as water reaches the top of the drain which is great, but the pump will continue to cycle on/off for some time after the water is drained. I gradually closed the flow valve until the pump stopped cycling. Unfortunately, the valve has to be almost completely closed which runs the pump for an extremely long time to drain and cannot keep up with the water from the washer.If there was a way to manually adjust the pressure switch this would be a great pump."
1,Don't waste you money!,"For that price, I expected much more. You only get an overview of the camera's features. No editing tips or raw format handling tricks. Really not worth the money. Read your manual; you'll learn more."
3,Too Much & Too Little,"I just passed the i-Net+ test today with an 87%, I used this book and it's companian i-Net+ Practice Exams. About half the book was really good, the other half was a bit vague. I still think it was decent & was good for the certification. The CD is a little different but I liked it better than CD's I've used from other books. The Practice Exam book I really did'nt care for & did not use it for the certification at all."
1,Serious lack of editing and proof-reading,"This is the first book I have read in preparation for the I-Net+ certification exam. Due to the many inaccuracies, I will have to cover at least one more prep guide before I feel ready to take the exam. While some of the chapters are well-written, the book as a whole is very poorly edited: the same concepts are described in more than one chapter, and terms and concepts are used freely before they have been explained. Also, as other reviewers have noted, there are many inaccuracies and mistakes - my favourite is the diagram of the 7 layer OSI/RM model that shows 6 layers. Additionally, the writer of the Network and Server chapters (I'm sure it's the same person) should be a poster-child for how NOT to write a technical manual - those chapters are gorgeous examples of dense, turgid and unnecessarily incomprehensible writing. I intend to use excerpts in my Technical Writing seminars."
1,A joke full of mistakes...,"While this book at times was enjoyable, and you will no doubt learn, it is filled with mistakes! At other times, the book seemed boring, like reading a dictionary. Just not that great of a book. And the errors really make it suffer."
5,Great!,"I bought this book as well as the Test Yourself book by Syngress. Both were very helpful in my prep. for the inet exam. The study guide was well laid out, and made sense in terms of progression and objective coverage. The sections on Security were very helpful (as somewhat a weakness of mine), and the chapters on Business Concepts were educational, and interesting to read. A good purchase."
3,needing more info,"All in all the product is not bad; it's excellent for the price. It was shipped quicker than expected, which is a good thing. However it wouldn't hurt to have the copyright date in the description and whether or not it contain a CD before it is purchased. My rating would have been higher had it not been for that.i-Net+ Certification Study Guide (CD-ROM included)"
2,Publishing fodder,"This book respresents the worst of the certification craze - publishers trying to fill gaps in revenue opportunity rather than gaps in knowledge. The book is verbose without soul. This book reads like it was written by a pool of writers with, obvious, no first hand knowledge of the topic. Chapter 5 on HTML, ""Understanding HTML"" begins with the topic sentence: ""The HyperText Markup Language (or HTML for short) is what makes the Internet graphical.""If you find this book at a garage sale, don't pay more than a dollar... and only look at the pictures (which is why it got 2-stars)."
1,"Too Little, Too Soon","This book will not prepare you for the i-Net+ exam. It was published within a few weeks after the exam itself became available and it shows. Containing many technical errors throughout the book which can cause failure on the exam if relied upon, it does not even address the exam contents. If you rely on this guide alone, be prepared to face many unknowns on the test. The CD accompanying this book has a test engine that does not work properly either. I was so disappointed with this book that I emailed the publisher, and never got a response. As a result, I avoid any exam preparation guide released by Syngress Media."
2,Decent - but beware of errors,"I found this book to be a fair representation of what is on the i-Net+ exam. However, using the book to study was very frustrating - it has several errors, contradictions and the software was inaccurate in some places. Compared to the test, I found this book verbose and somewhat of an overkill. In fact, I purchased it because it was the first to market in January. I sat for the exam today and passed (barely) but feel that Syngress could have done a much better job editing this book or at least offering a patch for the study guide. Considering the relatively high price, I would recommend going to another publisher."
3,Too Fast Out Of The Gate...,"This book is well written & easy to follow, but ""me thinks"" they rushed it to press a little too fast: There are some serious errors in some of the explanations, & in some of the review questions. Enough so, that whenever you encountered a confusing topic it made you wonder if you just weren't getting it, or if the book was just wrong. *I'm not talking about ""typos"" here, I'm talking about factually incorrect statements!Also, if you have any level/degree of networking experience, you will probably find this book a little on the ""wordy"" side (14 chapters - 650pgs). It appeared that different people wrote different chapters, so some items/topics were covered several times in several different places.If you're in a hurry to get this certification (I was), get the book...it does teach you what you need to know. Otherwise you might want to wait until Exam Cram (et al) comes out with a more condensed version."
2,Not a book that will get you pass the exam.,"Good book if you're just getting your feet wet in the I.T. industry. But Not a good source for passing the exam. I read this book thoroughly and went through all questions within the book as well as the CD-Rom. Failed the exam. So my next step involved purchasing Exam Prep and picking that apart. Passed the exam. As far as the Syngress is concerned, the consensus (regarding other certifications books they've published) seems to be that they don't have it down yet. Things like wrong answers to questions in the book and CD-Rom can lead to frustrating sessions, and as far as I'm concerned, that's unacceptible."
3,Good Overview of iNet technology,"I found this book to be a good overall study guide for the iNet+. I did find some errors in the questions provided in the book, and didn't like the test on CD as much as some of their other books. All in all, I think you'll find that this is a helpful book."
1,I agree -- too much overlap and too fast out the gate,"I agree with previous who noticed this book has ALOT of overlap. In fact it got quite annoying after a while. This book could have been great had they cut the amount of pages in half (thus removing the unecessary fluff), and this would also limit most of the technical innacuracies."
2,Too many mistakes.,"This would have been a great book if it weren't for the mistakes. There are too many typos, mistakes concerning the subject matter, mistakes with the practice questions...The one that was really an eye-sore was the questions about Internet Explorer that suddenly morphed into a question about Netscape? Or, the practice question on the CD were D was the correct answer because it referenced the correct answers of A & C but when viewing the answer, D is incorrect...A & C is correct! What the....?The mistakes became more apparent in later chapters and left me wishing I had waited for a better book and on-guard for the next error.Fortunately, I deal with about 70% of the material covered in this book on a day-to-day basis so maybe this is enough to pass. I feel sorry for people totally relying on this book as a source of *correct* information for the i-Net+ exam."
3,Starter Banjo,"Thought I'd pick it up again after 30 years -- was never very good.Unfortunately, mine arrived without the bridge (the piece that holds up the strings centered in the drum), and nothing else save the warranty and one page on adjusting the neck bow. For those new to banjos, usually you get assembly instructions and adjustment wrenchs. Assume someone left out that part of the shippment.FOR THOSE NEW TO BANJO, don't mess with it until you get one with a bridge -- it's ""defective"".Otherwise, really nice wood: good-looking rosewood neck (with inlays), peghead, and heel. Solid wood drum and head cover provide real value. Fifth drone string could be improved. Crome hardware OK but cheaper and may not hold up (likely to pit). Cheap strings, but replacement is a minor cost.Overall looks like a good value based on contruction. Of course without a bridge, I have no idea how it plays. Really disappointed."
1,Cute but very cheaply made!,The picture makes this costume look alot nicer than it is. The sizing states small 4-6 when it is really a 6-8. It is paper thin polyester with a raw edged pant hem. The badge is a stick-on that fell off after five minutes. The belt and the night stick broke within a few uses. Unfortunately the return policy of the costume company is not buyer friendly. I will have to keep this one and lose the $30.
5,EDDY DEMAYO HIHGLY RECOMMENDS THIS FLICK!,"TAKE IT FROM EDDY DEMAYO, KING OF THE ZOMBIE MOVIES, DAWN OF THE DEAD IS PERFECT! A GEORGE ROMERO CLASSIC! NOT TO BE MISSED! CLASSIC CULT FILM!"
5,It's the best book in fashion lingerie,"I'm a glamour photographer in Bandung, Indonesia and also a student of Photography. Well, I think this book explains everything from fashion photography. The photos are amazing and the theory is quite simple. The book is designed with a professional way and for all photographer (amateurs included !) who wants to study about lighting, setting, props and model-posing. If you want to learn about glamour photography, you should read this book and you can read other pro-lighting series like Glamour, New Glamour, Nudes, Fashion Shots, Portrait and Provocative Shots."
2,disapointed in the music.,did not enjoy the music as much as I have in his past performances. I always liked his music but for some reason ?? this one didn't do much for me.
3,"Pleasantly surprised, expected far worse","When writers author novels for a gaming universe, sometimes the works are quite interesting, but maybe because the authors presume the audience will buy anything, most of the time the works are subpar or far worse. Xenos is far above par but is not quite made for non-gamers. Xenos had some extremely engaging ideas supported by unfortunately a not very surprising or eventful plot. The main character and subcharacters are interesting as is the lovecraft style alien species. I will buy the next book and will look at his other books. Not great, but rather good."
3,Regular Car Wash,"First of all there is not much to review about a car wash product. You put the stuff in a bucket of water and you wash the car. The price is a little steep for the amount of product you get. The water gets very bubbly when you wash the car, and it smells like bubble-gum.If I had to do it over again, I'd just go to the store and buy some car wash there."
2,Deceptive photo,"The photo of the product makes it look like a huge container of soap. But it is only 32 ounces! Which to be fair is listed in the product title. But still, the shape of the container is being used to make the product look bigger than it is. The ""handle"" looks big enough to get your hand through, but you'd be lucky to get 3 fingers through. Also, the video shows a much larger container of soap."
3,Mothers California Gold Car Wash is okay...,"It's just okay...doesn't stay very sudsy. I have used this product for many years. It is economical, so I keep buying it."
4,Works great!,"This is some great stuff. It said only a few ounces per gallon and I was sceptical, but it worked great. This little bottle should last me a long time. I would recomend if you was your car or toys at home. I bought this to wash the motorcycle but would use on my car."
5,Best car wash I've ever used,"I'm 64, so I've used a fair share of car washes. This is like waving a magic wand. Bugs and road dirt come right off, but the shine stays on."
5,Works well,The soap suds well and keeps it's suds during my entire car wash. It leaves a nice shine and doesn't streak much at all.
5,Great collection,Good collection and a wonderful product. The movies are great entertainment and a wonderful variety.
1,james stewart screen legend,"Despite my ""multi zone"" dvd player I am unable to watch this film on my T.V, for reasons that I do not understand given that other American Zone 1 DVds (ie Meteor) work perfectly. Therefore I am somewhat disappointed."
3,just another textbook,nothing special about this textbook. I bought it because I needed it for a college course.
3,Pre - Calculus Larsen,This Pre - Calculus book does a good job with many well explained illustrated example problems but does provide enough challenging engaging and thought provoking applications. Functions Modeling Change by Hallett (Wiley Publisher) is the benchmark all authors should be aiming at.
1,Piece of Sh**!,"I have this book sadly for one of my classes.It gives the answers to all the odd problems, but doesn't show how that answer was obtained. So basically its just gives answers with no steps showing how.It gives problems for you to do, without showing you how. I guess your suppose to be a genius and magically figure it out.There are a good bit of problems that the do show you how to do (to be fair), but I still think that's total BS.I'm failing my class and I looked to the book for reference, and it did no good. I'm going to have to drop it."
4,Mostly a Good Book; some parts not clear,"When I first started to use the book I was impressed by the pre-requisite chapter, and I also thought the book was easy to read. I used this book for a summer session. Due to my very busy life, I found it necessary to read ahead of the instructor to be ready for tests. I found the writing in the last third of the book hard to follow. Our instructor told us not even to read these chapters because he didn't like the way the material was presented. I would give this 5 stars if the CD was included, but that is an extra [$$$]If bought for self study, you may find you need the CD, online help or solutions manual."
5,precalculus,the book was exactly as described it was in perfect condition and the delivery was swift and the packaging was very good
5,No student of education should graduate without reading this,"Tyack is the master of educational history. To know where we are, we must know where we have been. No student of education should graduate without reading this book."
5,lead for black powder,This is the best place to buy lead for muzzleloader bullets. The price is lower than the reloading places even with the shipping costs. Pure lead is pure lead no matter what it's labeled as.
2,Rather Dull Book,"Disappointing. In my opinion the title is misleading, it's more compendium of objects you might use on your altar than a ""complete guide."" Illustrations are only line drawings, paper is very cheap. I don't get the sense of quality that the subject deserves. Some helpful information."
3,Lots of Potential,"I would have loved to see (and would be more than happy to pay for) a book with the kind of georgous pictures that was on the cover of this book. There is so much potential for altars as an art form, and while this book included simple line drawings, glossy, full-colored photos would have been a delight. As far as the book content goes, it was informative and interesting. Provides start-up ideas for the beginner and inspiration for the experienced altar builder."
1,Lacking,"There are some wonderfull books about altar building on the market today. This one is NOT one of them. I was soooo dissapointed when I picked this book up. There are no photographs to look at and the information is hardly what i would consider informative. Try some of the other altar books on the market, ths one is not even worth buying used."
3,Disapointing,"I thought this was a OK book not what I expected. I thought this was going to be a book just about pagan altars and is not, it talks about many other altars and things so a lot of what was in the book did not apply to me. I thought it was a kind of a let down it should be more pacific with what kind of altars she covers."
3,"works, but doesn't fit","these cables fit perfect. right size, right holes, right lenth. but when i shut my tailgate, the looped end sticks out. right between the tailgate and rear quarterpanel, this cable does not want to slide into its normal hidden position. i bought this for utilitarian porposes, but thought i would let u all know, ...it doesn't fit."
1,Was supposed to be for 98 Chevy Silverado.,"Cable was about two inches too long. I haven't contacted the company yet, but I am now in need of two cables the correct length as well as a way to repair the bolt receiver in the tailgate as it has stripped out."
5,Good solid cables,"I installed two of these on a 99 Silverado. One of the original cables broke and the other was in bad shape. The Dorman cable looked pretty much identical to the original except it has a little more heatshrink on the terminal. The two cables were exactly the same length as each other and the original cables.I've had the cables on my truck 6 months now and have had zero problems or signs of wear. I've had excessive weight on the tailgate at least a dozen times when hauling dirt, moving heavy items etc. It is a good solid cable and a whole lot cheaper than dealer price. Can't complain."
1,not what they said it was.,this product doesn't fit .. after the system said it would fit. its to long for my avalanche... horrible... i don't want to go through the hassle of returning it .. but don't beleive the system when it said it fits your car or truck....
1,"The Power of Birthdays, Stars and Numbers","Very disappointing. I ordered this book, got confirmation of my order and then was notified that it was not available.The price was very inexpensive....for all the good that does if, in fact, you don't get the book!"
5,A perfect coffee table book,"This book is fun and everyone will pick it up just to ""see if it fits me."" Wonderful and entertaining. The perfect conversation starter and coffee table book."
4,will fit you to a tee!,"The descripiton of my zodiac sign in this book fits me perfectly. I also amazed some of my friends and family with it. A great resource if you want to ""really"" get to know someone before you ""really"" know them! The book is very thorough. It gives an extensive theoretical explanation instead of a quick ""what's my day going to be."""
4,Can't believe the accuracy of this book,"My daughter has had this book for years and I was always asking to borrow it when I met someone new. Then, I thought I'd check to see if Amazon might have a used copy. Now, I have my very own book and refer to it often. The descriptions given for the birthdays is amazingly accurate and helps me relate to that person in a more personal way."
4,"Power of Birthdays, Stars & Numbers .....","I gave this book to my son as a gift. One of his friends had it and he was intrigued with it. We looked up a few peoples birthdays and it really does seem to be right on the money. It's still pretty general, but it's a start if you're interested in this sort of thing."
5,I would recommended this book to anyone....,"In my opinion, this is a great book for almost all ages(or who can at least understand it) to read. I read this book in free time-at least what I can read of it seeing the fact that some of its pages are ripped out-and it is very entertaining. My daughter absolutely loves the book and keeps it her room all the time. I also think that the book encourages people to get up and do something with themselves. For instance, not to sit around on the couch all day or be just plain lazy! I would recommend this book to anybody and everybody who was born in (just as it says in the book)1930 to 2000. It's a nice book and explains everything from birthdays to which constellation you were born under.. Everyone who has this book or is at LEAST planning to buy it, I hope you have the same response as do maybe even better about this book..."
3,* Worth Adding to Your Astro-book Collection *,"I bought this book several years ago and still consult it from time to time. It has personality profiles for every birthday of the year and is an easy read with a lot of information. That being said, I don't find it nearly as accurate or fascinating as the ""Secret Language of..."" series. The ""Secret Language of Birthdays"" is set up on the same premise: astrological/personality profiles for every day of the year, but it is so much more accurate and with less information. This book is a bit wordy, but still a good read and worth adding to a collection. Please don't leave out the Secret Language series, though... if you're a true astrology fan you would be missing out if you don't have this trilogy of books."
