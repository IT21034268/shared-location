2,Tom Swift Adventures Are Great Reading!,"Tom Swift is one of my favorite books by Victor Appleton. Tom Swift has lots of adventures in it. So, if you like adventures then get one of the Tom Swift adventure books to have some fun! (I give it five stars, but for some reason my review shows only two.)dictated by Edward (8 y/o)"
1,These books are in the public domain and There should be no KINDLE charge,"Almost all, if not all of the Tom Swift Sr Books are available for free through the Gutenberg Press Project in MOBI/KINDLE format and should not cost the reader a penny."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS FOR IGUANAS,"No such thing as eadible substrate, this can cause intestinal impactions and put your iguanas at risk."
2,"Not bad, several nice looking models","Two features on one disk with several models that are worth a look. Probably most entertaining is watching where these girls expose themselves in public places - pretty bold. The one feature ""Caught in the Act"" has some of the same models from ""Naked by Nature: Volume 2"" and appears to have been put together with footage leftover from that video."
4,Good for what it is!,"I don't think anyone has ever taken the public-nudity concept as far as one could. The nudity on this DVD is only semi-public. Like in the countryside where a woman might bump into one or two people, or along the roadside where cars and the occasional cyclist are passing by. So if you're looking for women running around naked in shopping malls or other crowded areas, you might be disappointed.Still, this is professionally made with good picture quality (as opposed to some other public nudity-DVDs). And you get lots of full-frontal scenes of the tasteful kind. Many of the girls are attractive, both model-types and cutegirlnextdoor-types. It was made in 1996-97 so the girls often look natural both here and there.Regard this as a less pretentious playboy-DVD and enjoy it for what it is."
3,Asian Pleasure is Better,"If these women would have been Asian or dark, dark black women then this would have been a more exciting video to watch. Because of its lack of ebonic pleasure, it doesn't provide all the necessary elements for a successful flashing film. Like the naked yoga movie, its missing these important factors: no Asian or really dark black women and old people. Old women are the key elements to porn movies. How can you enjoy watching two women getting hot and heavy in their room, without one of those women being at least a minimum of 65? That's totally impossible. But for what this film is supposed to be, it does an all right job of doing it. 'Naked in America' is all about the white, which is also what America is all about anyway. But soon...an Asian invasion WILL occur, my friends. You can count it."
4,Get Into the Zone with Zen...,"I read fiction for a couple of reasons: I want to know what it feels like to live in somebody else's life, and I like strong character arcs. The stories in Zen and the Art of Surfing are strong as to setting, and satisfying as to narrative and character. It's easy to get lost in the settings, to imagine surfing (I never have), to feel the experience. Gutierrez' description of being in/on a wave, as well as the specific lingo, resonate with authenticity. Being pulled out to sea on one's board at night is delightfully scary, for example. Lots of sensory details, like the sounds of the surf, the smell of kelp, etc. I like his characters; the bad guys are delightfully bad, the good multidimensional. It's an enjoyable read and I recommend it."
4,Tales and Travels with a Teacher,"""From the moment I got it in the mail, tore open the envelope and took out this book, I could not put it down!!!Having grown up with him in California enjoying more than a few adventures together early in life or later on while visiting him on Maui, I am reminded how much the ocean means to me and what it has done for my life. His words are so real and possible that even those I know to be fiction could easily have been true. Spending time reading this book is only second best to surfing with Greg. So here's to you, Spidey!!! Never stop and better yet, keep paddling out and take us all with you! Remember that Nogales Hill and our blue Chuck Taylor's are calling to you......~Woodrow~Rick WilsonAdapted P.E Teacher"
4,Excellent! Killer! Awesome! Fantastic!,"In the spirit of the great guitarists, Warren and the boys put together a classic! Live... with a little help... is even better."
4,Bluesy,If you like the blues Gov't Mule is for you. Warren Haynes vocals and guitar work are first rate. Good CD.
5,This Disc Is Awesome !!!!!,"This is easily my favorite disc to be released in the mid 90's, It ROCKS, but it also displays a musical integrity that few bands ever achieve, I really like the mixture of Rock, Metal, Blues, and Jazz sounds they mix so brilliantly. There is not a bad song on this whole disc, I can listen to this from start to finish and never get bored with it. You have Warren Haynes great guitar playing and gutsy vocals, Allen Woody's tight bass sound and Matt Abts powerhouse drums all mixed together making a big heavy sound, a definite MASTERPIECE. If anyone who reads this review likes hard rockin' blues music this is a MUST have for your collection."
2,Not Niven's best,"This book is a mystery story, set on the moon. A murder attempt is made, and a woman accused. Gil the ARM must prove her innocence before she ends up in the organ banks.Though short, I found this story hard to credit. Though the science was well thought out (Niven's trademark), I did not think the characters acted believably. There was also too much gratuitous sex (Niven's other trademark) - the hero sleeps with the accused woman, his real girlfriend, and another woman he meets along the way."
2,Blah!!,I thought this book was one of the most boaring books I have ever read. If you ask me I thought they should of selcted different poems by Wendell Berry. None of them were good. I don't reccomend this book to anyone!
4,Good value,This set is a great value for your dollar. It is a welcome addition to my kitchen as a second set.
5,The Best Value for Money,"I have no connection whatsoever with Casio or any other watch manufacturer, distributor or seller. I just love watches. Bought this one two months ago and, like all my other Casio watches, it works perfectly well, absorbs no water when I'm washing my hands and, some time in the future when its battery dies, I'll take it to my little local watch guy and have the battery replaced, no big deal. I've seen all kinds of complaints about watches on this board, but you'll never get me to disbelieve that Casio watches are one of the greatest values for money on this planet. Purity of design, reliability, price, you just can't beat them. I've never in twenty years had one up and die. They just need a new battery and then keep chugging right along. If somebody comments on my watch and admires it, I just take it off and give it to them. Gives ME an opportunity to buy a new and different Casio!"
4,"I love the ""Be"" Series","I would recommend the ""Be"" Series books to supplement Bible Study books. I have purchased several of them. Very insightful."
4,Good Bible study.,"Probably not the first choice for a new Christian to read and comprehend; however a good, insightful study for those seeking a deeper knowledge of Romans and the motivation driving Paul."
5,Wow,Romans is the summary of the new testament faith of Christianity. This book gives good background and insight especially if used with a study group to discuss.
3,not too bad,"I found this commentary to be what I expected, but not much more. There are a lot of commentaries out there on each book of the new testament, but not much new information. You just kind of put them together and present the best you can. I'm not sorry I bought it, but will probably donate it to the church library."
3,One Glich!,"This would have been a four or five star except that the last movie, Pelican Brief, that we watched had either a scratch and kept skipping and repeating all thru side two. We just kept hitting the play button (after wiping it off, etc,). We'd seen all four movies a long time ago so knew the outcome.The other movies played perfectly... and much enjoyed again. My Mississippi husband is a great fan of Grisham."
3,"Very informative and interesting, but at places, a little on boring","I found the book very informative and insightful. It gives you a good feel of what it was like early in 20th Century for gay people, even in a big city like NY. It also provides thoughtful insight into fact that gay relationships are no different than heterosexual ones, except they are still not legal in most parts of the US. I enjoyed most understanding how these two wonderful men dealt with having to live in hiding and pretend to be something they were not to be accepted, to keep jobs, and even get living arrangements. There were parts that seemed to go very slow when came to operas, and the ""art"" part of their lives. It helped understand who they were as men, but for us who are not into that type of thing, kind of boring, and found myself moving past these parts. All in all a good read. I read it in one day."
2,great phone at first,"I have had this phone for about 4 years. I was happy with it for the first two. It has great features, never any problems with it until... After a while you will notice the #s on the keypad start sticking. Panasonic recommended doing something with it to fix the problem but it didn't work even a little bit. Most people wouldn't be able to put up with this. The problem gets progressively worse and worse. For a while I was using the back of a pencil to dial, but it results in mis-dials 90% of the time. Finally, the buttons have stopped functioning all together. I now dial from the base on speaker, and then pick up a handset once someone answers. Not worth it because by the time it happens it's much too late to return it."
4,so far - so good,"Light, easily readable, relatively inexpensive for someone who is rough on watches. Good deal. I have not tested it while swimming, but have gotten it wet many times. Very happy."
1,bad item,"The sales person was grteat, they shipped on time BUT TH EITEM IS NOT LONGER USABLE... the battery died!! and i have it for a month!!!!!!"
1,Waste of money,"I ordered this flat iron because my CHI had a short in it and kept turning off while I was using it. I have loved my CHI and it has done a great job for several years now. But when I received the FHI Platform I was very disappointed in the lack of quality. It was so bad that I sent it back immediately, which I rarely, if ever do. It wouldn't even get as hot as my CHI that was cutting on and off. It was advertised as getting to 450 degrees and the CHI only to 410. But it didn't nearly get as hot as the CHI. I would estimate that it was maybe 350 at its hottest. That's not hot enough to flat iron curly hair. Waste of money and time!"
3,Eh!,"Got it this week from Target, but had points, so I didn't pay full price.I actually like it better than the GVP (CHI knock off) I bought from Sally's. And I REALLY liked that one.I only gave it 4 stars, because I see it broke on some people within a year (**** update, this has happened to me, so I don't use this iron as much anymore. I am also relaxed now.*****).Originally, I like it because it straightens my natural hair very well and I don't seem to redo it as often, which is nice. It was every day with the GVP. Now it's only been every 2 or 3 days. All I have to do is wrap my hair. I also use it between 300 & 370 degrees. I also used a heat protectant with it, Beyond The Zone and Sabino Moisture Block. With this iron, I have a feeling I won't have to use it as often, or apply product all the time.So, so far, so good."
2,Extremely disappointed,"I purchased this when my $200 T3 Tourmaline from Sephora was short circuited in Europe. Since the max temperature was the same as the T3, I thought I could save some $ by purchasing a less expensive flat iron.Unfortunately, this doesn't perform nearly as well and ends up sitting under my kitchen cabinet. I am extremely disappointed - it hardly flattens my hair, even after running it through several times. I will not re-purchase. Looks like I have to pony up the $200 for another T3."
5,Blows Chi Out Of The Box!,"After my Chi died(The CHI used to pull my hair) I bought the FHI. I LOVE IT! It makes my hair so smooth. It doesn't pull my hair. It heats up quickly and does an overall fabulous job. I'm so happy I found this brand. I will NEVER use a CHI again. If you are wondering what brand to get... look no more, but make sure you get this one. There is another FHI that's less expensive and it does not work the same."
3,"Okay, but not the best","My FHI Platform flat iron arrived last week. It came pretty fast, only 3 days after I ordered it. The following Saturday was my washday and I was excited to try my new flat iron out. The flat iron worked pretty well, but I don't really see what the hype is all about. To me, it flat ironed my hair the same as my last flat iron, which is an Andis. The one thing that I like most about the iron is that it can get extremely hot and it runs smoothly down my hair shaft. It is not the ""perfect iron"" as many would describe it to be, but it gets the job done. What I don't like about the iron is that I expected my hair to get straighter than what it normally gets. Even when I put the iron on 350, I still ended up with my normal straight texture. I don't want to go any higher than 350 in fear of getting heat damage. This flat iron is ok, but not the best."
4,Great flatiron,"I used this flatiron on my daughters naturally curly hair. After washing her hair if you don't immediatey dry it or twist/braid it ,it becomes unruly. It took about a week to come in the standard mail. The day I got it I put it to the test. Turned it on and was shocked at how fast (less then 1 min)the flatiron reached 410 degrees (max). I poo, DC then dried her hair and then the magic began . Let me tell u this iron is AMAZING, as I ran the iron through my daughters hair I watched as this iron transformed her hair. Her hair was extremely Shiney and straight and once I got the hang of it I was able to add some gorgeous Shiney locks. I have used gold n hot and stove hot combs in the past but nothing every gave the results like the FHI Platform. The only reson I didn't give it 5 stars is because the first time I used it the FHI logo that covers the strews where the 2 plates meet fell off, however it continues to work well"
2,Great straightener until it stopped working,"I had a FHI for almost 7 years before it stopped working. When I bought this one, it was working great. It heated up quickly, made my hair soft and straightened it well (I have really curly hair). Then, after about 3 months, it stopped working. For the amount I paid, I expected the iron to work for much longer than that. And the warranty is only for 30 days. Sadly, I'm very disappointed because it was a total waste of money."
2,"FHI 1"" Flat Iron","I was very excited to receive the fhi 1"" flat iron. The box and product appeared to be the same as my other fhi irons (which I purchased from an authorized dealer), authentic. Upon using it a few times, I noticed the plates were not as smooth going down the hair shaft, nor did they straighten as well as the other fhi irons I have. I inspected the flat iron and compared it to my other fhi irons and noticed the product is not authentic. The base portion of the cord where it swivels is not the same as the other four irons I have (in various sizes), and the heating element seems to only work in the middle of the plate instead of evenly across among other inconsistencies. This vendor is selling a knock off! Needless to say I'm extremely disappointed....what a waste of money!"
1,FHI Platform Iron,"Professional hairstylist who previously used CHI and Paul Mitchell flatirons. Researched the FHI Irons extensively prior to purchase, and I am slightly disappointed. Rated low due to iron breaking within 30 days of purchase and not able to use wet to dry, like indicated on packaging. While in use, gives off strange fumes that create irritation of eyes and throat. Total waste of money. Not better than the CHI."
5,Great!,"This is the best flat iron I have ever used and I have used many! It leaves my hair soft, silky and full of body. I have four daughters and each have different hair types so the dial control is great because I can adjust the temperature for each one! I also like the fact that the outside doesn't get so hot that it's too unbearable to hold while styling."
4,so far so good!,"i just got this model and used it for the first time today. there was absolutely a difference in my hair. i was using a revlon ceramic before which was a couple of years old, so it was time for an upgrade. I went with this one based on the other good reviews. My hair is definitely straighter, smoother and silkier than when i used the old flat iron. it may be a five star item, i just havent used it very much yet! but so far its awesome! i 100% recommend this flat iron!!"
3,Sedu Where Are You!,I had a Sedu for about 3 years. It fell on the floor and broke apart. After researching flat irons I decided to give the FHI Platform a try. It's just okay. The Sedu got hotter using a lower temperature setting as well as produced a silkier effect on my hair.
3,Not as good as my CHI was...,"I had a CHI (no temp dial) for about 3 years. It was great. I took it to Europe and even with a converter, it shorted out. So, my stylist recommended this flat iron - especially because it has the temp control. It's just okay. I am African-American. I have mixed texture, unrelaxed hair. This iron and the CHI produce a nice silky effect on my hair. I just feel like the CHI got the job done quicker."
3,FHI Heat Platform 1 Inch Professional Ceramic flatiron,"I purchased this flatiron for my daughter who has very long hair. She had been using my CHI flatiron because it worked so much more smoothly than the inexpensive one she had bought for herself. We were disappointed to find that the new FHI would sometimes catch in her hair; whereas, the CHI had not.We examined both irons and found that the FHI has some little clamps that appear to be holding the heating tile in place. The CHI did not have any clamps that would interupt the sliding of the hair thru the iron.Other than that we liked that the FHI had a variable heat setting, and it does do a good job of smoothing the hair."
1,Good while it works!,"Loved it while it worked. However, after just a little over 6 months it no longer heats up. FHI won't do anything since Amazon is not a ""authorized"" retailer and they can't verify that it is even an original product, which is shady business practices in my opinion!"
1,This is not authentic!,"I bought this product in 2008 and i must say it did a pretty good job. I previously owned a CHI and the temperature control on this iron was what I wanted because my CHI didn't possess that. Well long story short the end of 2010 my flat iron just completely stopped working. I did some research and decided to get another FHI Heat Platform iron. I bought it from an authorized dealer an the differences were astonishing:(1) where there should be a registered trademark sign, there is just a degree sign, (2)There is no company information as far as contact information on the box of the non-authentic iron, (3) the iron itself looks different. Whoever makes this fake actually makes a pretty decent iron, but I am sure you can get a flat iron for the same quality for cheaper. If you are going to buy an FHI flatiron make sure you buy an authentic one that is really covered by a warranty, because this fake iron is not. Hope this helps! Caveat emptor!"
2,Warranty Problems,"The flat iron is good when it's working. The first one we bought from Amazon lasted 1 year and then stopped working. We bought a second one through Amazon and it lasted 6 months. When I called FHI I was told they would not honor the warranty because Amazon is not an authorized dealer. Save your money and go with the Babyliss Pro Nano Titanium 1 1/2"". Much better flat iron with a 4 year warranty - and it's cheaper than the FHI."
2,Can't tell the difference,"I like it, but I don't think it's worth the $200 as advertised nor can I tell that it's better than a Chi iron. It's a good iron, but the ionic crap and all the extras they use to describe it to sale it is not anything I can see."
5,FHI Platform Professional,"I've only recently gotten into tourmaline/ceramic technology and shopped around for a long time before I decided on investing in a FHI. PROS: My hair is definately softer and shinier after using this product, and it always gives me the same results. With my old flat iron I was never sure how my hair would turn out, it always depended on the weather and how often I was styling my hair. With the FHI I always get the same sleek, smooth look. CONS: A friend of mine bought a CHI turbo and that thing flattens your hair in one pass - I was hoping the FHI would pack the same punch, but in the end it takes me a couple passes to get it perfectly straight. Overall I'm very pleased with this product. SIDE NOTE: FHI's Hot Sauce makes a HUGE difference when using this iron - it's a buying must!! :)"
4,Concerned about the Warranty,"I am interested in purchasing the FHI flat iron again (after 4 yrs). However, I discovered FHI does not warrant the product if sold by an unauthorized seller (Amazon). Another reviewer is correct about the warranty information. An Amazon customer representative (Maira) said that Amazon will replace the iron or refund my money with a year. I intent the purchase this flat iron again. Let's hope it last more than 4 years this time."
4,wonderful flatire,"I've been looking for a flat iron with adjustible heat settings. Debated between Hana, Chi and FHI. My hairdresser recommended FHI (it is the brand used in his salon). The FHI was reasonably priced (HANA was outrageous) and does the job I want for my hair in between salon appointments.fyi, make sure to purchase the FHI platform. The other line, FHI technique, does not have adjustable heat settings."
1,No Warranty,"DO NOT BUY THIS OR ANY OTHER FHI PRODUCT !! I bought this for my daughter for her Birthday. She used it for about 5 weeks and it died. It was past the 30 day return window for Amazon so I contacted the manufacturer. They stated that they do not warranty any product not sold by them directly or through a professional beauty salon. I asked them why that was and they said places like Amazon allow other sellers to sell counterfeit products through the Amazon website, therefore they will not even consider my case. I found it appalling that someone would say that Amazon allows counterfeit products to be sold on their webite !! Is this true and I am that naive or did FHI just slander Amazon???"
2,"Not bad, but doesn't last long for the price","This straightener is a good straightener, but it doesn't last long for what you pay for it. I bought mine last year for $90. Less than a year later, the cord is shorting out and the straightener won't stay on unless I position the cord in such a way that the light remains lit. I'm actually a little worried about getting electrocuted lately because you can hear it popping, so I've retired my one year old $90 straightener and am currently seeking another. This is my second FHI straightener and I have course frizzy hair and while it does do the job, my hair submits to heat and humidity very easily and straightening has little effect on subduing that. I'm going to look for a less expensive straightener on here with good reviews because in my opinion a straightener that's close to $100 should last much longer than one year."
1,Lasted only a month,"I've owned CHI irons and thought I'd try this one. It lasted only a month and, as someone else stated, there is no warranty....which I wasn't aware of. A little disappointed with Amazon with how this was handled."
1,Worked great for 4 months then won't heat,"This product worked great for 4 months and now it won't heat at all. I am very disappointed in this product. From what i understand, there is no warranty through FHI since it was purchased through Amazon. I am not happy about this product."
3,Great Flat Iron- Short Life Span,"I am a Hairstylist and have purchased less than 6 months ago and the flat iron has burned out because of constant use. I've had 3 FHI's and all 3 have burned out in less than 6 months.Amazon this is not considered an authorized distributor and warranty is considered void.Disappointed with the flat iron because I thought buying a professional flat iron would last longer than 6 months. Good flat iron, however terrible warranty and the life span are not long if you are a Stylist."
1,FHI Heat is an awful company,"They claim that this straightener does not burn your hair because it heats your hair from the ""inside out."" Also because it produces steam not smoke. Let me just make it clear that if it is making your hair steam, it is drying it out and damaging your hair. I have been very disappointed in this company's products and they will lie all over their marketing to make them seem better than they really are. For example, they say that their hairdryer is unique because of its AC motor. Any device that is plugged into a wall outlet uses AC power. Buy a different brand."
2,Short-lived,"The FHI Platform is a great iron when it works. Too bad after using the iron TWICE, it has already shorted out. And as prviously stated, no warranty honored here. I have learned my lesson and will now buy locally where returns are easier. Very disappointed."
3,Good,"Ive used Chi for the past 5 yrs and it was still functioning properly. However I was getting tired of my hair feeling burnt, frizz and losing hair due to the pull. After a lot of research I decided to settle for Fhi. It has cut my straightning time and my hair is a lot shinier and frizz free unlike Chi. I still lose hair due to the pulling effect but it still isnt as much as Chi. However just running the starightener once will not get it straight. I have to run it atleast 3 times to get straight hair to my satisfaction versus running it 5 times with Chi. I wasnt expecting to run it more than twice since I have pretty much straight, fine, medum length hair with waves at the end and all I was looking for was a more flat straight look."
5,FHI,"Flat iron is great!! I was skeptical about if it would really be professional grade, but I am pleasantly pleased to see that it is. Flat iron is wasy to handle and very light weight."
1,defective,My daughter as bought this product before and it lasted 2 yrs . The one we purchased from World of Beauty only lasted 1 week and we had to send it back. We are still waitng since March 16th for a replacement.Not only was this unit defective I had to pay to send it back..so much for saving any money..
5,Great flat iron.,"I love this flat iron. I had a comparable model of the same brand that I used for about six years until I accidentally dropped and broke it. When I went to purchase a new one, my usual store no longer carried FHI. I decided to purchase a Sedu Revolution -- this $160 flat iron in no way compared to the FHI. In fact, the heating in the Sedu began to go haywire after only 8 months. Not only that, it took 2-3 passes to style my hair when the FHI only took one on the same temperature setting. Fortunately, I was able to return the Sedu and replace it with this FHI.I am so pleased with this flat iron. It works every bit as well as my previous model, and my hair looks great -- so much better than it had with the Sedu. I would recommend this flat iron to anyone and everyone."
2,Not good quality,"I've ordered FHI Irons before but for some reason this one was not as good as the previous one I owned. I had to set this iron almost to its highest temperature for it to perform like my other one. Plus I think this one is an older version so it probably explains why it doesn't work properly. Also, the encircled logo where it says FHI has popped off which I found a little odd. I'm basically disappointed and not sure if I should trust the buyer or not because the picture was misleading too (it looks nothing like the iron I received). In short FHI works really well so I am returning this for a better one probably from another buyer as well."
3,Really Good Iron But Doesn't Last Long,"I got this flat iron 11 months ago as a gift and loved it until it just died a few days ago. Since it was still within the one year warranty I called the manufacturer. Unfortunately, they told me that their warranty was void because I had purchased it at Amazon.com, which is not an authorized reseller. So, buyer beware. I would have given it a 4 out of 5 stars, but for $100+ bucks I expected it to last a little bit longer."
4,FHI Professional 1 inch Flat Iron,"My hairdresser recommended this over the Chi and the T3 Tourmaline. I spent alot of time researching this item and price. I found it at Amazon with free shipping and also Amazon had the best price. The unit works really well, and heats up very quickly. I like the fact that in addtion to getting my hair pin straight, I can also get a very loose curl with just a flick of the wrist. I haven't tried the other options for using the flat iron that are explained in the video on the FHI website but I have watched my hairstylist use it and I can't believe that it also works like a barrel roller. My hair feels softer and doesn't seem to be fried. The only drawback is that because the head is only 1 inch it does take me a little longer to do my hair ( I have below the shoulder length hair). I would recommend this flat iron if you don't mind the price."
3,Out of Warranty and Broken,"Purchased a little over a year ago. Iron is great for my coarse hair. Use several irons, this one maybe 5 months out of the year and only once or twice a week. Small chips of plastic fell and I did not know where from. Now the plate has come unattached exposing the inside cords. Out of warranty and I have to replace it. I guess if I had used it everyday it would have broken within the first year and the warranty may or may not have coverd the damage. WAS nice while it lasted."
2,Not recommended,"At least it was free. Had heard of the author but had never read one of his Westerns, was not very good"
5,I like Max Brand,"This is a traditional max brand western,written with suspense and a little lesson on life .relaxing a good read,habit forming,"
3,its OK but slow.,"Like many of Brand's books, this is predictable. Usually his books are a bit more fun. You can see where Brand wanted to go in this book but he really never gets you there."
2,Traditional western fare,"I know Max Brand is an icon in western literature, but I was a little put off by this story. The theme seemed to be that the protagonist was not tough enough in the mind of the blacksmith he worked for. It seemed very predictable. So predictable, I must confess that I did not finish the book. I gave it a two-star rating because it could not hold my interest."
4,Required Reading for Those Interested in The Secrets of the Ancient Pacific Navigators,"This book was another piece of the puzzle when I set about to add to my understanding of traditional navigation in the Pacific while writing my novel BROTHERS OF THE FIRE STAR. Gladwin, an engineer turned anthropologist, looks at the skills of navigation a bit differently than other authors who have investigated the subject. Though he is not an experienced hands-on sailor and did not spend much time sailing with and living with his subjects, his insights into how Pacific islander think about their world was instructive. I recommend reading this book along with THE LAST NAVIGATOR and WE, THE NAVIGATORS to get a well-rounded picture."

5,A treasure.,"Even with the internet, it's still very difficult to find genuine antique patterns for knitting, sewing, and other needlecrafts, possibly because not all that many survive. I've owned this reissue of Workwoman's Guide since it was first released, and as a museum educator and avid knitter, refer to it frequently for authentic source material for projects and museum interpretation of the Early American (19th century) household. A few words of advice to those who would like to attempt a Workwoman's pattern: there are countless diagrams to accompany the text, but few if any are to scale. Some of the terminology is archaic, but modern definitions and comparisons can be found in a comprehensive dictionary or on the net."
3,Skaventastic! Kind Of..,"I currently have a pile of about 30 Warhammer Fantasy books awaiting my attention. I needed a quick read so this one got the job. The writing seems fine, though not extraordinary.I saw an earlier review suggesting the portrayal of the 'Skaven' was a little off message, which I don't agree with.If you need a quick Warhammer Fantasy read then this will do the trick. If you particularly enjoy 'Skaven Stories' then you'll enjoy it even more.As deep as a puddle, but sometimes it's fun to run around splashing through puddles.Bump up to 3.5 Stars if you're a Skaven Fan."
5,The Dayton Family is awesome,Im Down wit Dayton Family u should be 2 cross these crazy motha fu**az and get dealt with
5,WOW!,If you haven't already heard the samples for this cd... what are you waiting for?! This cd I would agree is awesome (even though I have not heard the whole cd; the 6 preview songs were tight. If you like gangsta rap/hardcore rap... none of that really weak stuff... this is one album to get. It would bang decently with a decent system in a car... and did I mention the lyrics... WOW! an absolute 10 out of 10 (THERE ARN'T MANY OF THESE)
4,oh-yeah these boys can spit somethin serious,"If you don't got this album then I feel bad for you because your missin out big. These tracks are hard as they come. F.B.I. is a album every hardcore hip-hop fan needs in their collection. This might tell you somethin right here. I've had this album about 6 or 7 times already and out of a whole collection its one of the few that I have to keep close watch on or it will disappear. And if it does disappear it gets replaced A.S.A.P. Yeah yall, it's that good so if you've heard of it you know you want it. and if you aint heard it yet then listen to the samples, but first dig out those wallets because your gonna want that cash ready before you get done sampling this one!"
5,michigan gangstas,"Forget eminem...The Dayton Family are the real Michigan rap game repsentatives (Esham too). This album came out eight years ago and ""What's On My Mind"" came out ten years ago...and i never get sick of listening to them (Dopehouse bangs also). The Dayton Family is 100% real..not 99% fake(mtv/mainstream). So buy this CD, and if you can't handle the rawness, just keep listening to your Jay-Z and Ludacris CDs."
5,The Dayton Family,This is a great CD.. I ordered this album because I think it's a must have for any hardcore rap enthusiast. The produce came in great shape and the delivery was fast (only a couple of days).
1,testing of leather fanny pack,"We conducted a test to determine the suitability of this bag for day-to-day use. We purchased two of the bags. One was defective on arrival but was repaired locally (involved repairing the plastic snap waist clasp).During testing both bags failed identically resulting in the bag becoming unusable (our determination of unusable was when the cost of repair exceeded the cost of the bag). This failure involves the stitching between the waistband and the bag on the right side of the bag and results in the bag possessing no means to secure it to your waist.The vendor for the bag was contacted and we asked if the wished to respond to these failures. We waited for a reply for two weeks and have not received any comment.I would not recommend this bag for any purpose. Also, due to the response from the vendor due to these failures, we would question any purchase from this supplier."
3,Black Fanny Bag,"Need to know the exact size or sizes that this product will fit mens 38, 40, 44, 48 inch waist."
4,Flash MX from a designers point of view,"I knew some Flash already and wanted to expand this knowledge. I wanted a book that taught more advanced Flash MX techniques through conventional teaching methods but also with practical, real-life, step-by-step website examples.This books fits that description quite well! The examples are simple, but do give the reader the vision of how to expand on this in his own creative way, which is very nice.It also goes into the structure (planning) and philosophy behind a Flash MX website, which I found a suprising but nice addition."
5,Great Book,"Phenominal book with all the details you could ever want. Eric Jordan of 2advanced.com is one of the many sponsored guest authors. It's worth every penny of the price - you get all kinds of ActionScript codes, tips, tricks, and tweaks that you can't find anywhere else, and it's great for beginners and more advanced designers alike. I would recommend it to anyone trying to learn about Flash MX."
3,Not too bad,"This book has some high and low points. I got it along with a couple others, and found myself leaving this book to use the others to help create my movies."
3,good book - very bad indexing,"Book is full of good information, deep analysis of problems.But the VERY BAD INDEXING and organization of ""how to get the information"" is making it a chore to use it. It's ok the fact that much of the material is on the CD, but giving a clean way of reaching it would be a NECESSARY help. Too many words, too little code and examples and too basic FLA files obliged me to seek more advanced help in other books.Still good as a reference though (if you can find what you need ...)"
2,Better Books Out There,"For ... this book doesn't cut it. I know it's a reference book, but if you want to learn something from this at all...pass it up. I'm on a budget and can really only afford one book. Can't anyone write a book about a topic and teach you how to use the program as well offer in-depth information? The Bible is a book that rivals the user manual with a bit more words in terms of usability. I'm sick of spending money and not getting results - and the Bible series has sunk to an all-time low. The Dreamweaver, Photoshop, and now Flash Bible have become a waste. Avoid buying these books.I have returned the Bible and bought Flash MX Savvy - a much better deal."
1,Dull beyond belief,Surely Flash is more interesting than this! Where are the cartoonists and film makers?
1,Not much help for me,"I have not painted in over 30 years, and hoped that this would bring me up to speed. It didn't. Probably the least useful book on painting on my bookshelf. I'm not sure what this book is supposed to do for the reader. It didn't help me in the least."
4,not THAT bad...,"I'm pretty much a complete novice in any form of art, so this book was quite helpful to me. There are several parts I found useful-- how to hold and handle the brush to achieve different effects, comparisons of student paintings to similar professional works, separating 'value' from 'intensity,' etc. I can imagine this book being a waste of time for people who've been in relatively good art classes or who've done enough painting to have learned all of this already, but if you consider yourself an amateur, this is a good place to start."
1,Not so good first novel,"This book is a pointless waste of your time. You may get through it because the characters start out with promise. But, alas, Ms. Dunlap's skills gave out on her before she could complete the story. You will be unhappy that you wasted your time on this book. However, Ms. Dunlap's, second novel, Liszt's Kiss, is much better and you are most likely to enjoy reading it. It is very well written, tells a good story, and the historical fiction highlights certain French figures we don't often read much about. I really liked it."
5,First Time Historical Fiction Reader!,"This book is captivating -- a wonderful, compelling escape. It's beautifully written and refreshing -- a new introduction to a category of fiction that's great! Highly recommended!!"
1,Stick Pins in My Eyes,"As a huge fan of historical fiction, I looked forward to reading this novel on a twelve hour train trip. Sadly, only the fact that I was stuck on the train kept me reading it. The plot is wildly contrived. Characters are one dimensional and flip-flop on the same page between good and evil. The idioms spoken by the minor characters are laughable.Details are included that make no sense. Émilie, the main character, counts to six hundred forty-seven thousand and sixty-three seconds one day waiting for the maid and her husband to come home. What??? My twelve year old was reading over my shoulder and asked how this could be a real book. I had no answer for her."
5,A magical novel,Emilie's Voice by debut author Susanne Dunlap is truly captivating and magical. I highly recommend this book to anyone who enjoys historical fiction. I look forward to seeing this on the big screen.
4,Emilie's Voice,"Emilie's Voice is an intelligent and compelling piece of historical fiction. It contains a perfect blend: well rounded characters, an interesting moment in history, intrigue, love and sacrifice.Susanne Dunlap's portrayal of 17th century France is full of rich and authentic details. The politics surrounding an artist's success or failure during the reign of Louis XI is conveyed with a deft hand.In Emilie, the reader will discover a nave and engaging girl of humble origins, who possesses a glorious talent. As she is used and abused for both personal and political gain, her voice-- both as an artist and an individual-develops, reaching maturity that left me gasping at the startling conclusion of the story."
1,rock over nothing,"Wesley Willis is essentially a one-trick pony, and all his albums sounds exactly the same. Cheap keyboard, drum machine drivel, while Willis sings some out-of-tune rant, a few obscenities, and the song ends with a business slogan. If you think this is funny, and can endure the same joke repeated over and over, then be my guest.What chills me is the hidden agenda of the entire Willis franchise; 99% of his fans tend to be white teenagers, so there is an air of ""Hey Kids! Let's listen to the dumb black man make a jerk out of himself!""This review will suffice for the Willis album of your choice; essentially a modern-day minstrel show for the no-identity youth culture."
2,A disappointment,"I have enjoyed Laurie Colwin for years, and I was deeply saddened by her death. However, this particular book was a disappointment for me. The story is very repetitive, repeating events and thoroughly re-describing events that were thoroughly described in earlier chapters. The writing style and complexity compares well to a high-school essay. I liked that it was a short and quick read, but if this will be your first Colwin novel, I highly recommend starting with a different one from her collection."
1,A Strange Thing,"Isn't it strange that in all the photos of this Sterlingcraft gold-plated flatware on the internet, not one photo is a close-up of the actual pattern on the flatware? Are people supposed to buy it on the off-chance they'll like it?"
2,Analytical Chemistry Review,The book doesn't go into enough depth nor does itexpand on problem solving.
1,Poor quality e-book,"This book was obviously scanned in, but no one thought to spell-check it or proof read it. There are so many typos that it makes for a very irritating read. Amazon should not stocking this in its present format, and the fact that they charge for it is a pure disgrace."
4,Nice crisp clean scent,Love this perfume because it's nice and light and not to strong smelling. Couldn't get at my local Ulta because they said it is not selling well. Hope that's not true because I love this scent.
2,"Honor Among Thieves? The Rewards of Deceit, Double-Crossing","Mob stories like Tuohy are a fascinating study in psychology of criminal deception. While criminal enterprises require a measure of loyalty. The question is always, loyalty to what, to whom, and for how long? Tuohy really understands the incredible gullibility to those who want to believe in surface appearances, while he keeps his eye on his own main chance. Unquestionable it takes the kind nerves of steel that only a sociopath has to be able to betray those around him to the extent that Tuohy (the con)does.Author John William Tuohy's startling account of Ken Lelek and StarNet is even more incredible. It must have required amazing personal courage - few people would have the guts it to do it and expect to get away with it.The ""mob"" world is not for the faint of heart, though. The moral of the Tuohy yarn is that in the end the ferryman expects his due."
4,Should have been included with the main video releases,"They think we're gonna pay $10 for this? I mean that's too much to ask even for a single episode of the regular show! Also, it IS technically an episode of the show, and WB shouldn't have broken the sequence by leaving it out of the order (though they could have put it on the VHS after the ""cartman's mom"" legacy so it would be a set, but.... they could have made that tape 3-episodes!)the show itself was pretty funny though."
1,The worst South Park ever made...,"Terrence and Philip, South Park's cartoon-within-a-cartoon, is one thing as bits within ""normal"" (a relative term here) South Park episodes. As its own half-hour special, it is something else -- and not in a good way. Like a bad Cheech & Chong movie, except with awful fart jokes instead of awful dope jokes. This episode, broadcast as an April Fool's joke during the ""Who is Cartman's Father?"" cliffhanger, single-handedly destroyed South Park's following among my circle of friends -- we all felt we had been cheated.Upon reflection after the disaster, we concluded that it was probably a pet project of Parker & Stone; something the creators (and no one else) found hilariously funny."
4,"Works for adults, too!","It's really a shame that Nature's Sunshine has discontinued this product, because of all the cough syrups that I've ever tried, this one works the best, hands down! So it's a little misleading when it says it's for children--it works great for adults, too!The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because of how expensive it is. And the listing on Amazon is WAY overpriced--you should be able to find it on other websites for around $14 plus shipping."
3,"good cripmer, except for","I like the ratcheting crimper, and having the interchangeable dies is great. It worked great on the larger wires, but does not make a tight enough crimp on the smaller wires such as 18 gauge, even with the tension control at it's tightest. I still have to use my old manual tool on the smaller wires."
5,"makes ""production quality"" crimps","excellent crimper, terminals won't pull off, much better than just ""smashing"" them with the standard type crimpers. Highly recommended. Ratchet makes it very easy to crimp even larger wires. Tool feels like quality when using it."
4,So Far So Good,"The few crimps I've made with this tool seem as solid as those I've made with devices ten times the price, and while it lacks the fit and finish of those tools it's hard to argue with the price. No word yet on long-term reliability and performance, but if it breaks or wears out I'll report back."
5,Insulated terminal Crip tool,"This is such and improvement over the crimp tools I've been using. Because it has ""dies"" for each kind of crimp connector, it never cuts the connector, like the regular, flat tools."
5,RODS,"Very useful in your house, not only for gaps and joints. You can use it evrywhere you like in your house and outdoor."
2,Dante for bigots?,"Esolen is neither a Dante scholar nor an Italian language/literature specialist. He is an English Teacher at Providence College, a Catholic institution. His retelling of the Divine Comedy is reasonably accurate and quite readable. The problem comes with his notes. They range from the scandalously inadequate to the downright offensive. Esolen has written a number of anti-gay articles for religious publications . This is reflected in his notes where he refers to homosexuality as something like ""that most heinous of sins"". This is not only offensive in a contemporary publication, but is totally out of tune with Dante himself, who took a much more sympathetic and nuanced approach c.1300 AD. The skimpy notes manage to include other personal and inappropriate remarks.There are many superior translations out there. Mandelbaum's is excellent and has very good notes. Robert and Jean Hollander's is also very fine and the notation is the most extensive and scholarly of all."
5,Mining for gold in Monterey,"This is an excellent book, an easy read, and a painless way to pick up on a little California history. I think anyone from the age of about 12 on up would enjoy this book, and it would be an excellent and fun choice for a school book report for the student of California history at any grade level. It is must-read for anyone interested in the history of Monterey County. Who knew that the Monterey had such a rich history of gold mining in those beautiful, rugged hills?"
1,Never Received My Book,"I ordered my Legal Writing Book for law school on June 2nd. It was suppose to ship from Auburn, WA on June 4th to a business in Tacoma, WA. I never received the book. I had to wait until June 25th, before they would do anything for me, since they did not use a tracking number and kept insisting it might still be in transit. I was very disappointed and hated that they couldn't help me until the 21 days mark. Luckily, I was able to use a friends book in the mean time. I was able to get my money back with no hassle. It took about 5 days to show up in my account."
4,Milwaukee Panel Mid-Way Fence,"This a great addition to your Milwaukee Panel Saw. When cutting small panels for shelves, etc., you will thank yourself for purchasing the mid-way fence. A word of caution, the directions that come with the mid-way fence aren't very good. Measure, measure, measure when assembling and mounting the mid-way fence. Make sure you have a long level to ensure the panel rests are exactly even before you drill the four mounting holes in the back of the saw arms."
3,"they do the job, but...","Pros:1) keeps a tight grip on the bag, if you fold over the edge to prevent air from getting in2) despite being plastic, they seem to be pretty durable and the spring is still tight3) they make keeping small bags of chips, etc. fresh easyCons:1) they make keeping ONLY small bags of chips, etc. fresh easy - you can't effectively use these clips with larger bags. For that kind of job, use the bigger clips. Better yet, if you don't want a kitchen drawer full of clips, just get the bigger size and deal with the mini-bags looking a little silly with a large clip - it will do the job just as well as a small one and is more versatile."
3,Expected it to be more emoliant,I purchsed this product as I was running out of my eye cream. I have used eye cream since my 20's and am now in my late 50's!I had heard some much about this brand that ordering was a no brainer. I find it to be better for night use as oppose to everyday under makeup. The consistancy is not as light and creamy as I expected. I have not used it long enough to state wether or not there is a noticable difference.
2,Eye Cream,It burn my eyes and never saw any real results. This is the second time I tried it and won't be using it any more
5,STRIVECTIN CREAM FOR EYES,GAVE 5 FOR THIS PRODUCT. LIKED A RESULT AND USE IT FOR A FEW MONTHS. WOULD RECOMMENT TO PURCHASE THIS PRODUCT.
4,I think it works well,"It lasts forever, which is great. I don't think it's a miracle cream or anything, but my eyes look better and feel much more supple than before I used this. I've used it for two months so far, every day."
2,Not as great as the hype,"I'm fighting dark circles, bags and crows feet around my eyes and I couldn't wait to try this product. I bought this cream, confident it would be a huge help and it wasn't. My eyes watered, which made them evem puffier, and in the morning I had to wash it off and use something else. I might try it again (for the price of the product I feel I have to) but my initial reaction is that it's not as good as it's cracked up to be...at least not for me."
5,Good Bye Dark Ring! You Suck!,"Viva StriVectin. I'm a young guy who was skeptical about this type of product. After being RIPPED OFF BY the HYDROLEYEZ Lies, I have to say; I actually noticed a difference using this product."
2,It does not work for lines,"I started to have lines under my eyes two years ago when I turned 26. It was about 0.5 inch long under each eye. I was totally freaked out and wanted to do something about it. I started to fight these lines two years ago with Clinique's Advanced Stop Sign. After 2 jars and no result, I had to call it a quit.Since then, I've tried StriVectin-SD Eye Cream, Kinerase, and Creme de La Mer, which also didn't work for lines. I have to say StriVectin-SD is the worst from the bunch. It is greasy and doesn't make my skin any firmer. On a bad day, I would break out. Kinerase is a little better in that it's not greasy. La Mer was really good for firming and making my skin look dewy and soft, though it may not improve lines.I have tried using Estee Lauder Perfectionist and Advanced night repair and they both seem to improve the lines pretty well. I think I'm gonna continue to use Estee's products until I find anything better."
1,Have sensitive skin? Do NOT use this!,"I have sensitive skin and this product burned my skin, leaving burn marks for weeks! Finally, I went to the dermatologist who had to prescribe something to help the skin heal. Please, check with your doctor FIRST before trying this!"
3,Worked well but temporary and very expensive,"I think this product is overpriced and will only help some people but if it does help you significantly, it may be worth the cost. A good friend and I both started using this around the same time. We both noticed an undeniable difference in the fine lines on/around our eyes/eyelids. The areas above my eyelids were lifted from use of this product and this made my eyes look years younger.For some reason, this effect was temporary for me. The wrinkles and sagging seemed to creep back for me and my friend. I can't explain why. I stopped using it for a few months figuring it was a waste of money to keep using it if it wasn't helping. When I went back to using it, I saw improvement, again. I can't explain why it would stop working and then work again, but this is what happened with me. If anyone can explain this, please add a comment to my review.Given their competition, I think it would be a smart marketing move for the company to lower the price."
4,excellent,I order this item for my friend. I received this item very quickly and my friend love this stuff she think it work for her.
1,What's this?,"I received a different version of this product and it is highly irritating??????It is a purple and white tube of a different shape although it is labeled as ""Strivectin Eye Cream"". After applying it my eyes became very red and watery and skin itched for about 2 days. The old form ( I presume ) was great ...why was it changed?"
5,Works pretty good!,"I've only been using it for about 2 weeks now, and while it hasn't done much for my dark under eye circles, it's made an amazing difference in my crows feet! It's worked better than the other eye creams I've tried so far. I recommend it."
3,unsure of effectivness,"I have only been using this prodcut for a few weeks, so I have not ntoiced any significant difference in my eye lines. But my skin is softer. My hope is through continued use it will keep new damage at bay!"
4,works well,"I like this product, but am not sure it is worth the money. I have bought other products for $5 at my local store and I seem to have similar results."
3,Keep Away From Eyelashes!,I've been using Strivectin products for a few years now and am very satisfied with the results...however I recently proved a hunch that it's wrecking my eyelashes! They were falling out and grew back not as thick and long...I stopped using the eyecream and kept the face cream away from my eyes and switched eye products....now my lashes are coming back in healthier and not falling out ...can anybody recommend a good eyelash product? :-)
2,I Liked the Original Eye Formula Better,"I ordered this product (at the full price of $59) because the photo showed the Strivectin Eye Cream in the Black and White tube, and in a different shaped tube, depicting the ""Original Strivectin Eye Cream Formula."" But I received the new formula instead. I had tried a tester of the new formula in a store, and for me, it stung and left me with a mild rash. I used the original formula for several years, very satisfied and wanted more. Does anyone know where I can find it?"
5,Great item,Item arrived as described and is now being put to use. I hope it will work quickly and make a new me.
5,Great product,I am in my 30s and this product is great. It softens the skin around my eyes and makes it feel great. I recommend this product to anyone.
2,Doesn't live up to the hype.,"I'm using all the Strivectin products with a few of the Hydroxatone ones. Out of all the product creams, this is my least favorite. It definitely doesn't live up to the hype. You only need a tiny bit, so it will last a long time- maybe it's a good long-timer product (months). After a few weeks, it's nothing special though. I'd skip it and stay with the regular facial cream and get close to the eyes, it doesn't irritate my skin in that area and I'm extremely sensitive to products out there."
2,Umm..NO,"I have been using this for months and I have had no results as far as helping fine lines or crows feet. It says to use morning and night, but it does not absorb well, so you cant wear it under makeup. It may work better for someone that doesnt wear makeup and can use it twice daily. I dont think it is worth the price though."
1,AWFUL!,"I agree with J. Arango. Burned my eyelids which peeled in flakes like a burn victim. 1 month later, still sore, itchy, red and puffy. Never allergic before or have I had sensitive skin. Don't buy."
1,Counterfeit product,"Although I should have expected it given the severely discounted price (paid ~$20, including shipping), I was pretty disappointed and frustrated when I received the product and saw that it was NOT a genuine Strivectin SD eye cream as advertised. I've bought real Strivectin SD eye cream through other vendors (Ulta, Sephora), so I know what this product should be like. The packaging and design is totally different; the color and consistency of the product itself is different (real Strivectin is very thick and pure white; what I received was dark tan with a thin consistency); and most importantly the product I received doesn't really do much of anything, whereas real Strivectin is amazing and highly effective.This may be an issue with the particular seller from whom I purchased this (A1A toys) and not necessarily with all the options here on Amazon; however, I do recommend that people exercise caution, especially with the exceptionally cheap options."
2,Poor Quality Black and White Only,I have no problem whatsoever with the disc. The printed matter however was poorly produced with flimsy covers and in black and white format. Considering the subject matter and the cost this leaves a lot to be desired. Overall sadly disappointing.
1,useless,"If you are a good enough photographer to own a Pro 1, this book is too basic for you. Very disappointing."
2,LOVE MACHINE SUCKS.....BUT NOT GIRLS ALOWED..,"THIS SONG IS SO...OLD AND CHEESY KINDA MUSIC.I LOVE ALL THEIR OTHER SONGS AND THE ALBUM IS FAB,BUT THIS IS THEIR WEAKEST SONG TO DATE.I LOVE SOUND OF THE UNDERGROUND AND NO GOOD ADVICE.NADINE AND CHEYRL ARE THE BOMB.THEY ARE ALL BRILL"
3,Learned but heavy,"I found myself being frustrated by the convoluted nature of his arguments to prove - IMO - unnecessarily academic and esoteric points. The writing style, while reasonably light, does labour on some issues to justify and support his arguments to a degree that is a little too involved. While I fully appreciate that Mitchell needs to properly formulate and support his arguments (and he is right in most of what he says I must add) - the shear ""readability"" suffers from the overly-academic rigour present. I would happily accept less rigour for have more anecdotes of misbehaviour for a more ""easy read"". Nevertheless what he says is very important, solid and I agree wholeheartedly with it."
5,"Insightful, Entertaining and Informative","As an adoption professional, I recommend this book to all of my clients. The author turns the daunting task of drafting an outreach letter into a manageable and enjoyable process. Written with insight, sensitivity and humor, the book guides you from initial idea to final product -- an outreach letter that speaks honestly and compellingly to potential birthmothers."
2,NOT THE BEST,"What can i say? I've read better books. Also, this book does not compare with Bram Stoker's Dracula. One of the reviewers for that book said this book is one of the first books written in a similar gothis style such as Frankenstein and Dracula. I didn't read Frankenstein but I did read Dracula and Murcheston can not compare. I found the narrative dull and predictable. I didn't feel sorry for any of the characters. There werewolf scenes are not noteworthy or refreshing. I was very disappointed. I read The Passion by Donna Boyd and even though I didn't love the book, The Passion has a much better story to tell than this one. The idea of the werewolf was at least a little more refreshing. anyways, if you do insist on purchasing this book, get the paperback - it's cheaper."
1,Oh Puhleeeze,This book is the worst. The main character is so vapid and boring it's not even funny. This is a novel that is clearly 378 pages too long. The characters are poorly developed; the subplots are dull and this transformation the Duke takes on is hardly original. The Duke is a self absorbed child. At one point the Duke was run over by a carriage....I was hoping the book would over and down with but then I realized that I had over 300 pages yet to read. Dont' waste your money or time.
5,Ching-Chong Jing-Jong grew the grain...,"I love this CD. If it doesn't make you laugh, there's something wrong. It's only a 6 song mini-LP, but the songs flow together wonderfully and have a 'marketing/commercial' tie-in, as the TV on the cover illustrates. Maybe a little pricey for about half an hour of music, but the Dots make it worthwhile.Tracks: 1. Blasto 2. Love In A Plain Brown Envelope 3. Sleezo 4. Neon Gladiators 5. Kitto 6. Eight Minutes To Live"
5,halloween,"geat shipping time, mask looked real, felt good on face, comfortable to wear, would buy from this person again, sorry my review took so so long i just recieved an e-mail today about it and i reciveved the mask a month before halloween, i dont know what happend here.. but thank you again!"
2,"A Study in Psyhopathology, Marred by Burton's Showy Performance","Very much minor Losey, this film, based on actual events, looks at the events leading up to the assassination of Trotsky in Mexico in 1940. Alain Delon is very good in the film, while Losey, true to form, has a particular ability to create suspense through minimalist techniques - remember THE SERVANT as another example. However the film is spoiled for me by Richard Burton's mannered performance in the central role. While he could be a great actor in certain films - even CLEOPATRA is watchable, in a macabre kind of way - he also made some terrible films. If he wasn't kept under a firm directorial hand, he could end up being terribly hammy. This film offers a prime example."
1,TROTSKY WAS A MIGHTY WARRIOR,"When this movie was shown in Sweden back in 1972, a small and somewhat cranky group of Trotskyists became very upset.This group, known as Posadists, picketed one of the cinemas showing the movie, and passed out a leaflet. The leaflet said: ""Trotsky was a mighty warrior. His pencil was his sword and his eyeglasses were his shield"".And no, I don't know if this is a true story, but I heard it second hand from several sources. The Posadists also believed in UFOs and wanted Brezhnev to nuke America. Or so the grapevine says. The truth may be very different, but since nobody seems to take this movie seriously, I guess I could report this funny rumour...As for the movie itself, I've only seen it once. And no, it wasn't very good. Trotsky, after all, was a MIGHTY WARRIOR. LOL!"
3,Beware of this particular tape,"Although other reviewers haven't mentioned it, every VHS version of this film that I have rented has mistakenly switched two of the film reels so that the narrative chronology is out of sequence. Otherwise, this is an interesting Brechtian study of Trotsky and Jacson in which Burton and Delon are as much playing themselves as their ostensible characters. As one critic put it at the time, ""Burton playing Churchill, Burton playing Trotsky; what's the difference?"" The non-psychologizing alienation effect is deliberate."
4,Missouri trees,My sister is moving into the country this year and I thought this would be a great gift for her to identify tree's and wildflowers on their land. Although small it looks to have great information in it about some of our tree's and wildflowers in Missouri so they can identify more. Would love a big colorful book on this same sort of thing but for the time being it will do the job.
5,The Popinjay Goeth Before the Fall,"This book was written just as Walter R. Brooks was hitting his stride as a writer, and is one of the better Freddy books. A robin friend of Freddy's needs glasses, and from there the story gets wilder. The book is great fun and, as in all the Freddy books, has some lessons to impart to the reader, one of them being that conceit is not only a vice, but a rather silly one. This lesson is taught, as always, without a preachy tone intruding on the story."
2,Don't know if I believe what I have read,"What I mean about this title is this. Christopher V. V. Parnell mentions in his book that he doesn't smoke. However, on the front cover of the book, you will notice that he is holding a cigarette in his left hand. The same photograph appears later inside the same book. When I see such ambiguities, it always (with me anyway), casts doubt on the integrity of what I am reading. If you read this Christopher, please advise.Thanks.....J"
5,this cd is off the hook,man this is far the best dru down album..it's hella tight ..every song on it has it's own perfection..dru is always dru..so 5 stars is what he deserve..peace
2,"Great price, but not high quality","The scale is a great price and comes in a handy storing container, but it broke after only using it twice."
3,A bit small,"It measures accurately, but I'm concerned about the way the measuring pan fits on the scale - it can get wobbly at times. I guess its just right if you want to take a scale with you on a trip, but if you plan to use it regularly in the kitchen, then you might want to consider spending a little extra to buy something more sturdy."
2,cheaply made,"wouldn't adjust to a tare, so never could zero it. wasted money, but what do you expect this cheap, not again."
5,"For a cheap Plastic scale, works great.","I would love something more high tech, made of better materials etc. but for the price it works great. I use it every day.UPDATE...Almost a Year later, I use this on a regular basis and it is still going strong and has not lost its accuracy, it looks, feels and costs, cheap, but have had no problems, I use it for measuring anything from 20gram portions of nuts to whole tomatoes, yams etc for accurate calorie calculations when making large stews. I can get total calories of all ingredients ahead of time, then calculate the calories of each portion when the stew is done. I would love a fancy digital scale but this will do for now and has paid for itself a few times."
2,cheap,"this item was ok just as I expected I wish you didnt have to comment here on every thing, one two three four five six seven"
5,Be careful if you give it as a gift,"I bought this scale for a friend so he can make pasta. It's perfect for cooking -- he can weigh out flour, and the plastic bowl comes off to dump the food wherever you want. Easy to wash and easy to store (it fits inside itself).But, if you're going to give it as a gift, be warned it says ""diet scale"" on the box or something like that. My friend thought I was implying he should go on a diet when he received it in the mail. I had to explain that I meant it for cooking/baking."
3,It's OK for the price,"At five dollars (at the time I purchased), it is a good buy. I had one that broke after a couple of years use. The zero-setting knob became detached from whatever it is attached to inside. But, for the price, I just bought another one. I like how it all stores in the storage container."
4,Great for the price!,"This is a great little scale, does the job fine. It's no substitute for my full-size krups scale (especially since it doesn't work very well with a plate and can't be adjusted for tare easily), but is a good basic scale. We use it primarily with cooked foods for checking portion sizes.I especially love that it all fits into its own little sealable container too, it fits in a drawer easily and is very handy that way."
1,Junk,"I bought this scale to measure my food, because I am on a very strict diet plan. I think this scale is complete junk. Not only does this scale not measure accurately, but it never takes the same measurement twice. I would not recommend this product to anyone. Do not waste your money."
4,Not bad for a little scale,Well I used it in my restaurant and yes it was okay not the best of the best but for 11 bucks it was good enough to measure basic not exact amounts so if you need something for appoximate amounts I say go for it. not bad for the price I recommend it but also will say it will not take to much abuse its made of plastic..
1,CHEAP-TINY-FLIMSY!,"1st of all, this thing is tiny. 2nd, its really really cheap. 3rd, it really is just flimsy and has no sturdiness to it. If I put anything of weight in the container, it flips over and causes a mess. So dont waste your money on this scale."
1,"reasonable product, but awful warranty","i bought one of these a few years ago, & it worked just as it should. however after a few years of v light use, it expired, & i assumed with the longevity of warranty i would have a replacement whisked to me within a few days. sadly no. they demand you pay for postage, & the cost of so doing is almost the cost of a new one, so the warranty is worthless. DONT RELY UPON WARRANTY. Buy for a couple of years use. better still buy an unbranded one locally for $2 instead."
3,Too small,"Replaced a digital kitchen scale (which broke after less than a year) with this product. The scale platform is extremely small, making balancing items on it a chore - but the large scale display makes it easy to read even with bulky items piled on top. Both the size and the 16 oz maximum make using the included storage container (to hold items to be weighed) a necessity, which means extra cleaning. The zero adjustment is useful and easy to use (for a mechanical scale).The major factor, for me, having spent 4x as much on a digital scale that broke in just a few months, is that I expect this mechanical scale will not give out until the spring does.If one could find a piece of lightweight, food-safe, firm plastic, and glue it to the scale platform, this might increase the utility of the scale by allowing one to weigh bulkier items."
4,Meets my needs perfectly,"I bought this in target for $4.99 . It gives an accurate result. That is all i am bothered about. Though digital scale may have been more convenient, this serves my purpose and is a good value for the price."
3,Could have hoped for more,"I would recommend on spending a little more and getting a digital scale, this one although meassures well has to be adjusted everytime."
5,great buy,"For the price and the convenience, this scale is exactly what I wanted. The weigh and save container makes it very easy to weigh lunch in the morning before work, or a snack for a trip."
1,Terrible Gauge Cover,"No good... not recommended.VERY hard to fit over the Morosco gauge (which IS very good).Once on, the rubber broke after about a month.Junk."
5,Works as advertidsed.....,Recieved promptly from Amazon.. In order to install I had to remove the head off the Moroso tire pressure gauge and work the cover on.. Not a lot of difficulty to do that and I was aware of the procedure when I purchased the product. The Moroso tire gauge should have the cover on it when sold but it doesn't so that is irrelevant here. I highly suggest installing this cover to absorb shock if you drop the gauge and you eventually will.. trust me..
3,"Yes, you really do need it!","It really does protect the gauge and I'm happy I bought it.Be careful when installing it, because it can tear the rubber aroundthe square hole when putting it on.For something that's supposed to be heavy duty I think it shouldn'ttear when putting it on.Thankfully it didn't tear all the way through!The tearing when I put it on is why I only rated it 3 stars,and another reason it should come with this already on it."
2,poor product,"Went to use the gauge today and the cover has already split at the hole for the nipple. Poor product, save your money"
1,Product Did not fit,"I bought a manual air pressure gauge, which cost $25.00, the gauge cover, which was advertised to go with this gauge was TOO big, and did not work. Because it was only $5.00 and I broke the shrink wrap package, I kept it."
4,Useful but Mounting Difficult,"Ordered this along with the Moroso gauge. Trying to get that small square hole pulled over the stem head, large rubber nub on the hose, and the release valve is a real mess. In the end, easier to just remove the gauge from the hose, install, and reassemble. Once installed, fits tight and provides good protection for the gauge."
3,Gauge cover,This is the wrong size gauge for the tire pressure gauge I bought. Amazon recommended it. Why would they recommend a cover that does not fit
5,Gauge cover,The Moroso pressure gauge cover was designed to fit Moroso gauges. Fit is very snug and does a great job protecting the lens and body of gauge from impacts and scratches. Highly recommend.
4,Moroso Tire gauge cover,Great product and company. I got it sooner than expected and was exactly as advertised.
3,Gage cover,The cover is a little oversized for the Accu gage that was purchased at the same time. It will protect the tire gage but is a floppy cover for the gage.
3,"Good product to protect your gauge, not so easy to install","This cover is a good idea, but difficult to install as it requires the hose to be unscrewed from the delicate gauge body. The nuts are so tightly installed I have not completed that step yet. A good case will also protect the gauge."
4,Does What It Says,"Seems to do what it says and in that sense it would get 5 stars. But I agree with the other reviewer(s) that it should be part of the gauge itself, not an extra cost option -- minus 1 star.It appears to offer the most protection for the edges of the gauge and less for the front and back. Thus, it is intended to offer protection against occasional drops, but not so much against scratches, dents, etc, from other tools in a tool box.Installation is easy: remove the hose from the gauge, spray a LITTLE silicon inside the cover, work the two together, and re-attach the hose."
2,Has little substance.,"I purchased this book used. I always avoid Hollywood autobiographies, they are usually not very good. Don't know why I looked into Ms. Hyer's, but I did, and it indeed was not very good. She writes like a pleasent enough person; she was not a great actress by any means, then again--she wasn't all that bad, given the right material. But, she skips over much of this, and touches on the famous people she knew. She narrates how she eventually got in debt badly, found God, and was bailed out by her powerful husband, Hal Wallis. End of story. Yet between point A and B, she elaborates very little except in the most superficial insights and reflections. Her best career move, going by her text, was marrying Hal Wallis."
5,a wonderful read especially for newbies!,This book is a fun and entertaining read! In my opinion the collection of stories in this book is actually an essential read for anybody unsure of coming out. It gives you that encouragement boost knowing that you're not alone out there. It's a must read! Don't hesitate in choosing this book. ^^
2,It's just a collection of people's stories...,"Not only is this book, that is authored by TWO people, unaffecting, it's not even really written by them. They've got an intro in every chapter, and that's basically it. It's a collection of people's stories. That is something that should appear in GoNYC magazine, not in a book. This is the first of it's kind, and I expected it to move me. It's not informative and it's not different. It's full of cliche's and there's even a rip of a dashboard song. ""Turning to you is like falling in love when you're 10."" If you're going to have most of your book written for you by real people, at least have what you write be REAL and YOURS. Even Greg Behrendt's ""It's Called a Breakup Because It's Broken"" is more effective than this. This is the book that stereotypes are made of."
5,Goes a long way No problems,"Both the HP #15(B&W;)as well as the HP #17 (Tri-Color). These HP's inks are very long lasting. I work with alot of accounting w/having to make numberous pages of copies each mo. ALSO I make dozen's of varied photos making Collages and practice copies on Double WT. HP Photo paper. Sometimes I wonder if my two 2 Inks are ever going to run out. BUT they haven'T failed me yet, and I've been using my same old HP #425c for about 3 yrs. now, and always have used the same HP INKs mentioned about.The price is also very reasonable esp., a real bargain and the HP #15 because it comes in a double pak. I rarely have to replace these.I'd recommend both these HP INKs anytime. You can'T go wrong.Also ink dries before the photos oR B&W; copies are finished printing.Never any waiting for the Inks to dry.I'd swear this INK goes a long ways or I wouldn'T be using it."
2,Irritated with Vendor,"Order was placed on 12/27/12 from ""Midnight Merchant"", but did not ship from the vendor until 12/31/12.Initiated a return request on 1/28/13 but was denied. I felt that the 30 day guarantee should apply from ship date and not the date of my order."
1,Can't review,Never received product so can't review - supposedly post office error. Will not order with the company again though since they do not insure their shipping.
5,Reducing printing cost,"The product arrived quickly, works fine, reduces cost, and payment was simple. What else can a buyer expect. Good online purchase experience."
5,best price around,"it is worth getting HP brand name cartridges, but not at the prices on they charge on HP's own shopping site."
2,Hit and miss,"I've ordered these twice now. The first time was OK; the second time I got a defective cartridge in the 2-pack. I just discovered it, since I haven't been printing huge amounts at home, and now it's too late to send it back.Think I'm going to spend the couple extra bucks to buy these at a chain store locally so I don't have to deal with this again."
5,Oh I Love This Show!,"Life is addictive. I bought the dvd for myself, but haven't been able to pry it out of my daughter's hands to watch it! We both love Dani, Ted is such a cool guy, and watching them interact with Charlie, and watching Charlie change from episode to episode is just so COOL.Can't wait for the rest of the series!"
5,"Witty, fast-paced ""Zendetta"" with appealling cast!","You haven't lived 'til you've seen ""Life,"" the best show on the air right now. Lewis and Shahi are great, with wonderful chemistry, wit, warmth, and compelling secrets. About 1/4th of the cast of ""Deadwood"" and many other terrific character actors at to the fun and tension. Biggest bummer is that the excellent and diverse music used in the original broadcasts of the show is mainly stripped from these DVDs due to licensing issues and costs, but let's hope they sort that out when the 2nd season set comes out!"
5,Life - First Season,"I had watched the first season and enjoyed it. When the second season began, I loved the show so much I ordered the first season on DVD. I really love the characters on the show and especially like the ""new"" captain they added!"
5,Loved it,Didn't watch this show when it was on tv. I really wish I did truly enjoyed myself. Great story line.
4,great suprise,I have only seen Damien Lewis in Homeland and had no idea that this show ever exsisted...but I am so glad to have found it! It had a very interesting spin on a detective series. Detective Crewes had a different view of so many things that happened it gave a fresh feel to an old genre of tv series... i would reccommend watching the series!!
3,Interesting to watch if nothing else is,"Not extremely entertaining but worth watching if you got nothing better to do. There's a sense of mystery in the show that keeps you wondering...was he really framed from the inside, who's responsible, how many are hiding the truth? I find it unrealistic that after spending so much time in prison now he knows more about ppl, but it works, makes the show interesting."
5,The best unknown series on TV Life,"This is one of the smartest and interesting shows on TV. I love the relationship between Charlie and Reese. The ""Everything is connected"" is an important part of the show and it details well the connection of things. The unique way that Charlie sees the the world and solves crimes is interesting and smart. Reese is a great partner for Charlie they play off each other well and have a deep loyality and bond that grows each show. These two are GREAT. If NBC doesn't keep it on NBC they should move it to USA as it would fit great with Pysch and Monk. (+ Life) that would be a great friday night line up. The conspiracy and the breakdown of solving the case is awesome."
5,Damien Lewis-A New American Hero in his own,"Damian Lewis, just as he always has, seems to deliver HEART & SOUL in this ""dramedy"" as he called it about a ""still young"" cop who spent 12 years in jail for the gruesome murders of his friend & family that he didn't commit. The entire cast (with the exception of the ""bad character"" Jack Reese, --who needs to go back to acting schhol, does an excellent job) delivering this intriguing story. Lewis is excellent as the confused, yet quirky, smart, funny and sexy cop who gets his life back & is still seeking the answers to the puzzle of who set him up & killed his friends. THIS IS BY FAR THE BEST TELEVISION SHOW IN YEARS! KEEP IT ON & DO SOME PROMOS NBC!!! It returns this month in a week or so & I have yet to see one ad stating this~!"
4,"Your Second Chance at ""Life""--Don't Miss It","I missed this one during its short run on network television, and I guess I'm not the only one. This deserved a better fate than two short seasons. Like Monk (with which it has often been compared), this isn't so much a police show or a mystery. The crime just serves as an excuse for a quirky character to act inappropriately. That's OK with me. And I enjoy the supporting cast (Arkin and Shahi in particular shine), and I appreciate a show that relies more on clever words than action."
1,I DIDNT BUY THIS,THIS IS THE FIRST I'M SEEING THIS? I NEVER BOUGHT THIS? WHAT IS THIS ABOUT? I NEED SOMEONE TO CONTACT ME ASAP!!!!
3,"Promising, but","The lead character is a little unfocused, and his partner is a little unbelievable. But the premise is good, so I will watch a couple more episodes to see if it grows on me. As it stands, much of the show is nothing new. Trying to figure out who sent him to prison is a fresh take, but the rest (his millions, the fact that they let him back on the force, even if it was a part of the settlement)is far-fetched. It's not awful, but right now, it's not great, either."
1,Depressing show,Couldn't watch the whole show. It was too depressing to find out about a character who was wrongly imprisoned and comes out kind of bitter thruout the show. Love the actor in Bands of Brothers; but I thought his talent was wasted in this TV series which I just heard was cancelled.
5,Great show,Season 1 of Life was a very enjoyable watching experience. I decided to give it a try because I like Homeland and Damien Lewis is wonderful in that. Loved the story lines and the characters.
4,Great show too bad it was cancelled,"The network cancelled this show and it's too bad, since it was great. The acting was fantastic and the storyline was engaging."
5,why did they cancel this?,"Great show, cast and writing. Damian Lewis is a great actor as proven already in Band of Brothers, and this was his best vehicle since."
5,Fantastic Show,Absolutely one of the best shows on television right now. The cast is amazing and the show mixes procedural drama with a continuing mystery storyline and great character growth. There is something for everyone to love. I would highly recommend this series to anyone!
4,Non typical american drama,"Rather disappointed to see this show withdrawn. I found it to be clever, well written, well cast and wasn't the usual american cop drama. Had humour, and covered subjects the others seem to think not worth a crumpet."
4,excellent,"Great pairing in the show. Really disappointed it was dropped after just two seasons, another Firefly, I guess. However, I've read that a new TV series based on the Reeves character is being developed. Can't wait."
5,Good show,"Fast paced, quirky, exciting, bittersweet, feel good TV series with good actors that play characters you want to keep tabs on. I was hooked when the series originally aired. I was glad to see it was available for purchase and I ordered it right away. It's enjoyable to lose yourself in one episode at a time."
2,"The show is great, but it's the wrong music !!","I LOVE this show, it was the best new series of the season, and I fell in love with everything it is. It looks at first like another cop drama with a twist, but that description couldn't be more further from the truth.LIFE is great, funny, light, intelligent, serious, dark, it's got it all, the writing is awesome, so many terrific lines/one-liner that are just brilliant, directing, acting, music selection, it's a masterpiece of art!BUT : I have not and will not buy the DVDs, and I recommend against it, because NBC screw things up and IT IS NOT THE ORIGINAL MUSIC !!!The replaced the music everywhere by some other songs, and it's far from being anywhere near as good as it originally was!![...]No way I buy DVDs like that, that's not the show I watched, love, and want to watch over & over again, not like that. NBC, you just lost a customer."
3,Great show. Shame about the music.,"Life is a wonderful show ... one of my all-time favorites. But do yourself a favor and catch the episodes on TV if you can. The DVD release uses a different, and vastly inferior, soundtrack. There were some powerfully appropriate songs attached to key scenes, and the show loses something without them. (The online episodes use the same second-rate soundtracks as the DVDs.) I won't say I regret the $20 I spent on Season One, but I'd gladly spend twice as much if only they'd included the original music. Bad call, NBC ... bad call."
5,Fantastic!,My wife and I have enjoyed this immensely. I don't think we have ever enjoyed any series this much. Do you self a favor and watch this especially if you like you like cops and robbers.
3,"Good stuff, if a bit grim","I watched the first two episodes but will stop there.Episode 1 involved the murder of a child and Episode 2 involved a man's 'pornographic fixation' on a female murder victim killed on her wedding night.Grim horrific plot subjects aside, I enjoyed the actors and their roles but it's just too gritty for me to invest my time in. If you're okay with these kinds of stories, you'll like it."
2,Contrived without redemption,"I managed to wade through a few episodes of this unimaginative series. Based on the reviews, I was hopeful that this would be an interesting entertainment. Not so - contrived characters lack depth - contrived plots lack interest - just couldn't find any redeeming qualities."
5,unexpected,"My husband and I started watching this show after taking the tour at Universal Studios. We were allowed to see the set and that made us want to watch the show. The 1st couple of episodes were unusual. It didn't flow well. We kept watching and ended up hooked. The acting is first-rate and the storyline keeps us guessing, which doesn't happen very often on network TV. We're thrilled it's been renewed."
5,Best show that was,"I watched Life from the outset. I tried like hell to get people to turn it on, knowing that once they did they would be hooked. I figured since I liked this show so much, it would go the way of Arrested Development and Kitchen Confidential. I have to thank NBC for deciding that five days of Jay, would be so much better than an episode of Life. In anycase, stop picking on Fred. I understand what he means. The music fit so beautifully with the program that it is sad that it isn't on the dvd. I too will wait for them to put the original score on the dvd. Besides the acting, writing, etc., there is the music that makes the scene."
5,The Best!,This is the best show by NBC in a long time. I hope enough people watch so it will be renewed for season 3
5,Phenomenal start to a (hopefully) great show,"I honestly hadn't thought twice about this show until I saw it on the Unbox downloads. Since it was free, I thought ""Hey, why not?"" I am so glad I watched it - what a great pilot!! If it is indicative at all of how the show will go, I'll be a devoted follower.The acting was incredible, great cast rapport and really fantastic writing. I was involved in the show the entire length of the episode, and found myself becoming truly involved with the characters. Lewis bring immediate personality and depth to the character of Charlie Crews, and Sarah Shahi shows complexity as his reluctant assigned partner, Dani Reese. Already these actors are showing incredible versatility and range, and this is just the pilot!I'm really excited to see where Crews investigations of his own framing take him. After suffering for 12 years in a maximum security prison for a crime he didn't commit, he's got some accounts to settle. Should be good TV!"
5,Great Pilot,"Wonderfully and quickly set-up, this series while linked to similar ""police dramas"" this show is different because of the main character's ""colorful"" background. Check it out!"
3,"Ok, but not great","I was a little disappointed in this show. Should have figured as it was an NBC show. They never have been able to get things going since their Thursday night comedy night. Oh well, maybe it will get better. I'm still pissed at the fact they wont use iTunes. Unbox so far is poor quality and LONG, LONG, LONG download times!!"
2,Great series bad DVDs,The original music set the series apart like no other series I have ever watched. I think the studio is trying to double dip and will release a Restored version next year with a BlueRay version.Until they come up with the originals stick to TIVO.
4,Well constructed and high quality,"This upholstered chair is upholstered from a vinyl like substance, making it easy to clean. The seat is also well balance so that it doesn't easily tip over (although it might if your child tries to climb over the seat back. Overall, well constructed."
1,WHERE'S THE BOOKLET????,"In the VHS box set, there was a great 10 page booklet with lots of pics. of the MGM stars and the studio. No such thing in this DVD set. Bummer! That's why the one star."
3,"Unfortunately, the revised version","Back when TNT aired this series in the early 90's, it was one of the best documentary series that was produced. However, almost immediately after its broadcast, Robin Astaire (Fred's wife) forbade the usage of any of his clips on ANY documentary, suggesting that his image in such capacity will ruin his integrity- or a facsimile there of. So, when issued on Laserdisc in the 90's, all the Astaire sequences were either cut or replaced- i.e., the clip from Ziegfeld Follies, the Babbit and the Bromide number with Fred Astaire and Gene Kelly was replaced with Judy Garland's The Great Lady Has An interview. The version released on the DVD, unfortunately, is still that one. While TCM aired the series right before the DVD release, it was indeed the original version with Fred Astaire intact- you can either keep both, or just keep the TCM recording, since it would be more complete... such a pity for a great documentary."
5,One of a Kind Find,"If you call yourself a lover of ""Old Hollywood"" or ""The Golden Age of Hollywood"" this is an absolute must. This film has the benefit of interviews with not only the stars, but the workers behind the scenes that were with MGM since it's inception. Patrick Stewart is great as host and narrator and the depth of information is unprecedented. Greatly entertaining and informative."
2,I'm Kinda Amazed ...,"At the glowing reviews this book has received... because I don't think I read the same book as everyone else.The book itself dragged on, and you will find yourself getting impatient because the author is just too wordy, and I mean too wordy in a sense where its just boring.... the heroine is a manipulative sneak... very un-virtuous spoiled brat, a compulsive liar, and only time she shows any honor is when its convenient to her and what she wants. Add on a a hero who was mainly just gullible dullard...To be frank, skip this book."
5,WoW!! Great Read!,"My second Jane Feathers novel (1st was Velvet) & I must say, I loved them both, although I was taken with Virture's complex storyline more. I loved how self sufficient our heroine was & how the hero was right in step with her throughout the entire novel. A truly entertaining read - highly recommend."
4,the exiles,the exiles was a wonderfully written novel that is full of suspense and keeps the reader glued to their chair. It is a masterpiece and is well worth reading. You really do feel like you are there with the convicts.
4,Well written!,"This is the first in the Australia series, and I am interested in reading the rest of the books in the series. The author does a good job describing the heartwrenching and many times unjust conditions under which the convicts were brought to Botany Bay, and also brings to life the obstacles that were present in the lives of poorer English citizens of the time. Characters are well-drawn and interesting. Recommended!"
5,Great Parenting Tips for any parent,"I bought this book because I was told that my son showed some ADD tendencies. I was pleasantly surprised that this book provides excellent parenting tips for all children, ADD or not. Whether or not my son actually has these traits, I now feel equipped with skills to effectively discipline and to help him learn self control."
5,life changing,"This book changed our family. If you're willing to work hard, change as a parent, and truly see the changes you want in your family, this is the book for you. It's extremely practical and easy to use."
2,Not the whole story,"While this is an interesting and enlightening book on the subject it tends to be one sided - against the use of medication rather than open to all alternatives. ""No Apologies For Ritalin"" By Dr Guptka may be a better choice in that it provides and indepth analysis of the condition and offers the reader(parents or caregivers) the choice of alternatives that best suits their situation."
1,This book was of no help!,I bought this book in hopes for some information that would really help our child. We are foster parents who can not spank kids so that is not an option. The author spent 95% of the book telling you what didn't work. When it came to the meat of the book it was of no help. I have read alot of books on this type of behavior and this book would not be recommended by me.
1,Slow,I was informed when I bought this item it get to me in 3-5 bus. days on day 4 it has not been shipped yet.
1,"Tracy Dombrowski, military wife","This book was a great disappointment to me. Newly married and with a husband immediately deployed to Iraq, I was looking for books that expressed some of the feelings and experiences I was having to deal with daily. Unfortunately, for me, this book was overly sentimental with little of the real life thoughts and feelings of other military wives that I know and have talked with. The stories are true but they carry little substance or deep thought. I love and respect the military, their sacrifices and the sacrifices of those that are left behind, but this book was a huge disappointment. I would not recommend it to anyone else."
2,too long a wait,"I searched extensively for Neil's best compilation. All his cd's have one or two of his really great songs and the rest his lesser hits. After getting frustrated trying to select one that had most of his really big hits i finally felt compelled to purchase the largest compilation. There are 43 songs in this two cd set. The last half of the second cd had his most recognizable tunes. Too many of the tunes selected were definitely not memorable nor his best.It would have been preferable if his really big hits were scattered evenly throughout this ""Ultimate collection""."
3,"Good, but gruesome","""Come Clean"" is well written and insightful in its description of the cross-generational and cross-cultural relationship between the detective and his domestic partner. The villain and his crimes, while believable, were too gruesome for me, and the ending too farfetched to be satisfying."
3,MST3K Fans Rejoice -- Rifftrax is Here!,"And the people cried out with one voice, ""Maketh us a movie in which Marlon Brando can don a muumuu, false teeth, clown white make-up and a really gay bonnet. See that it also stareth Val Kilmer at his scenery-chewing best. And, yea, putteth the extras in hot, smelly animal suits and maketh you the plot absurd."" And, lo, did John Frankenheimer deliver unto us The Island of Dr. Moreau. And it was good. Truly, you must see it to believe it. But you must only see it accompanied by this RiffTrax, for which Mike enlisted the talents of Kevin Murphy, or else you WILL die."
5,"""The Island of Dr. Moreau"" (1996)","Although I favor the original 1933 version with Charles Laughton as Dr. Moreau, this remake, with Marlon Brando has such a weird, off-beat treating of the story, that it makes it quite unique, and intriuging to watch. And the creatures are top-notch (thanks to Stan Winston)! I recommend this movie for anyone seeking an ""unusual"" experience! John Christman, Pa."
4,awesome,"Of course the movie does no justice to the book,Its a MOVIE.No films are as good as the book.But instead of judging it from the book,try to see it as just a regular film. No matter what all the critics said I loved it."
3,"Crazy Val, Crazier Marlon","One of the craziest remakes of a remake of a remake that was totally a waste of talent from such top shelf stars. Marlon Brando walks around most of this picture as if he were on medication. What was that thimble on his head? Or was it an ice chest? Who knows...who really cares. Val Kilmer looks as if he were looking for his agent to get him out of this crazy thing. The one thing this film has going for it is the special effects. Its also very quirky, but stick with the 1977 Burt Lancaster version. Its much better."
1,I DONT SEE WHAT THE BIG DEAL IS...???,"I have to say I dont see what the big deal is. I had to make myself stay awake to watch this movie, to me it just seemed to go nowhere. Iv prabaly forgotten more movies than most people have ever seen, and I have to say this was one of the worst ones I have ever seen !!"
3,Everyone Will Have a Different Take,"I've never seen such a strange, bizarre, and unique movie. However, I watch this every time it's on TV, and enjoy the DVD. Something keeps me coming back, and watching this over and over. Why? If anything, the performance of Val Kilmer alone should turn anyone off to this movie - he flips between sanity and insanity.Whatever reviews you see, good or bad, forget them - rent this movie, and form your own opinion. It's really something that everyone will see differently. The majority will find it too bizarre, but it's worth the risk.You could also draw upon a number of themes:- The raw behavior inside humanity- The dangers of playing God- Existence is Suffering- InstinctsJust take a chance."
3,Don't be turned off by all the negativity,"I remember the 70's version of this film and have always loved it. This 90's update does take certain liberties with technology, but it just goes with the times we're living in. The film does not lack plot at all. It is a bit bizarre, but if you're an enjoyer of all things strange, you should have no problem with it. I like how the characters seem to be deranged and lunatic. Perhaps this is what happens when you isolate yourself on an island for years, playing God. If you've read the original novel by Wells, don't expect the movie to be 100% right with the book. You know movies never do that."
1,Kilmer should never work again,"This film is unintentionally the funniest thing I have seen ever. As a musician I found the piano playing scenes so disturbing I thought I was going mad when I saw it. The onlt thing worse than Brando's hammy acting is Kilmer. Watch Thewlis, he knows this is bad and is scared out of his wits. Avoid like ""Venom."""
3,"Brando, Kilmer, Perlman, What More Can You Ask....Oh yeah A Decent Plot Would Be Nice",Length:: 5:58 Mins
1,Confused......,"I have no problems with the movie....I ordered it because I love it, but the dvd is confusing...I thought there was a commentary by the director, tried both sides but no luck. ."
1,one of the worst movies of 1996,"come on people, 5 stars for this junk. yes it has Val Kilmer and Marlon Brando in it but they dont save it, not by a long shot. it starts off good but then when they get into all that beast and grotesque situations..it downs the movie big time and did we have to see that mother beast giving birth I mean come on now!! the only good part is when Kilmer's and Brando's characters die. a mess of a movie"
1,Not what I paid for...,TiVo listed this amazon.com purchase as the 1996 version with Marlon Brando and Val Kilmer.The 1977 version was the one I received instead.I am not happy...
4,Sick and twisted fun!,"While everyone goes on and on about Brando's overwrought performance they overlooked the rest of the cast. There's Val Kilmer, a good actor who is in a bad movie and seems to be loving every minute of it. Then there is the British actor David Thewlis, good actor who is in a bad movie and seems to want to duck behind a tree every time the camera is on him. This film is so overblown that it has earned a place as modern cult classic, and it deserves it. View with an open mind."
2,Needs to be remade,"I liked all the actors but I agree with another reviewer that Val Kilmers character was a little odd. I guess it made sense if you think about it and I guess they were trying to imply the rot had already set in on the island. Most of all, I did not like the special effects and I can only think that will be more and more noticeable as the film ages. The animal costumes and makeup looked pretty bad-more like great halloween costumes. Brando, a great actor, has never been a favorite of mine and I watched this movie because I like Kilmer. Overall, kind of a depressing movie that I wouldn't want to watch again."
3,"so bad, its good","Assuming this movie was intended to be a serious sci-fi thriller, I would say it failed miserably in that aspect. It was a horrible movie the first time I saw it. The second time, I realized how funny it was, especially Brando and Mini-Brando. In my opinion, its not worth owning in a serious collection, but a good rental."
1,AWFUL!!!!!!!!!!!!!! DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME!!!!!!!,"Absolutely one of the WORST movies I've seen in the last 20 years........so bad, it makes disasters like ""Beverly Hills Cop III"" and ""Natural Born Killers"" look like timeless masterpieces. Marlon Brando & Val Kilmer both had to be heavily influenced on pharmeseuticals to agree to ""act"" in this piece of garbage!"
3,"A strange, disturbing movie","I borrowed this dvd from the library and a few times while I was watching it, I almost turned it off. It has some unsettling scenes, silly-looking humans made up to look like human/animal hybrids, and way too much animal screeching noise. The performances of the lead characters kept me watching. Brando, Thewlis, Kilmer and Balk all gave interesting performances which made me curious to see what would happen to their characters. The music is beautiful and haunting and so are the sets. Most of the dialog has depth and, as another reviewer pointed out, eloquence. I felt both revulsion and pity for the hybrids and humans trapped on their island either by their own doings or the machinations of others. And yet it is an oddly compelling movie; a sultry, twisted, fascinating train wreck of a movie."
4,A STRANGE AND UNUSUAL FILM !!!!!!,"THIS MOVIE OFFERS WONDERFUL CREATURE EFFECTS, BEAUTIFUL CINEMATOGRAPHY AND A VERY STRANGE STORY. IT'S NOT MY FAVORITE MOVIE, BUT IT IS WELL WORTH THE VIEWING. THE FIRST HALF OR SO OF THE FILM WILL KEEP YOUR INTEREST, BUT THE SECOND HALF MAY NOT. HOWEVER, YOU SHOULD STICK IT OUT FOR THE FINALE!! JUST REMEMBER, PEOPLE ARE NOT ANIMALS AND IT MAKES A GREAT POINT- NEVER MESS WITH SCIENCE!!!!SEE THIS FILM, IF NOT FOR THE SPECIAL EFFECTS, BUT FOR THE SCENERY!!!"
3,Good movie but....,"This is a good movie but it will not blow you away. This movie is a remake, but like many other remakes it does not outshine the original movie. The original idea is cool, combining human and animal dna together for survival and this is the last movie Marlon Brando did before he passed away but it is nothing special. It is just another movie that loses steam and is very average."
3,Intriguing issue but the plot unraveled,I saw this movie when I was teenager and it was awesome. I saw it again as an adult and I was kind od disappointed. The main issue being explored is very interesting but the plot itself didn't go anywhere.
4,Very Interesting Re-Make,"This re-make (""The Island Of Lost Souls"") produced some fascinating and gruesome human-monsters. You can thank Hollywood FX wizard Stan Winston for these creatures. Sadly, Stan just died last year (2008). He was fantastic in his trade.Meanwhile, Marlon Brando and Val Kilmer ""play God"" attempting to create perfect human beings. What is created instead are ""people"" you almost don't want to look at. It took me two viewings to be okay with it. The first viewing left a bad taste in my mouth, but I gave it a second (and a third) look because the story is so different and intriguing. I liked Brando's dialog, too. His role, as ""Dr. Moreau,"" was easily the best in the film.*****Spoilers**** What else is a bit unusual is that almost all the main characters in this are killed off by the end, some with sudden surprise.Back in the '90s, when DVDs began, this was one of the best-looking disc I had seen up to that point. It would be nice to see a Blu-Ray made for this film."
1,Bad Chemistry & Bad Film Making don't Mix,"This five-finger man gives this film 1 finger (guess which finger). Brando gives a performance unworthy of his oscar status, & Kilmer is either too stoned or too bored to even finish his lines. Not even Fairuza Balk's beauty or Stan Winston's exceptional effects could save this hairball of a flick. Someone call the vet 'cause this film deserves to be neutered. Bad doggy; the litter box is full; and yes the lion sleeps tonight - 'cause this movie put him into a coma."
1,WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU PEOPLE!,"You're serious. You like it. Ohmigod, you LIKE this movie? Maybe Moreau wasn't just working on that one island...This is a very very very very very very bad movie. The world is not big enough to contain very's this movie deserves. (8 trillion times infinity at the very least)Tasteless, unfunny (though I did like the little piano guy) and generally bad. The guy below hit the nail on the head. You don't actually LIKE any of these people! The hero, Prendick is a wimp. The cat girl is just dumb. Montegomery is um, strange. (What was the POINT of his Brando impression?)Close your eyes, overcome the vivesection and repeat after me. I will read the book, I will read the book, I will read the book...Join my campaign to destroy the master copy of this movie. Or better, have them dump every single on Congress, they wouldn't know the difference between that and one of their daily sessions."
1,Just when I thought that the 1st one couldn't get worse..,"..I sat down and watched this. I couldn't believe all the critics hated it and it was rated in the top 10 worst films of that year by all of them. Saddly, I found out that they were right. This is amazingly bad. I just don't know how you can go from pre-production to post and still produced vomit like this."
1,"OK Action, needs a plot doctor.","I picked up this one for the price and it did sound interesting. If it wasn't for the fact that I was without a TV, no internet, and the radio was background music only, I wouldn't have finished it. Plot was contrived. At the very least when someone is trying to kill you, you focus on that, not our protagonist. Goes downhill from there."
5,Awesome Price!,"I had no intention of adding one of these to my truck till I seen this price and then I had to have it! This was an easy install just had to remove the old factory hardware and install the new setup to the original location. This intake added an awesome sound to my truck, sounds almost like it had a 4-barrel carb under the hood now.You can see and hear this setup on my website [...] in the Ford F250 Super Duty section."
4,great musical,Last year my theatre group did blood brothers and i played linda and even though she sings very little I still loved the music. They didn't have just one narrator but instead they had a whole chorus of narrators so i got to sing shoes upon the table and such. The only thing about this musical is that some of the music tends to repeat itself but other than that its great. Favorite sont: bright new day!! (we had relaly really funky choreography to go along with it!! Anyways its well worth the money cause its a great cd!
2,Not as good as the Stephanie Lawrence version,I have listened to both versions now and must admit that there could be no better Mrs Johnston that Stephanie Lawrence. There is a presence with her performance that I just don't feel with Petula Clark. I was actually very disappointed with the version under review as non of the passion was there.
2,"If your a Cassidy Fan, this album still isn't for you :(","I bought this album as soon as I knew it was available, and I couldnt wait to hear it, But I guess I set my expectations too high, The cassidy brothers sing in very few tracks only like 5 out of 22 or something, and they dont even sound like themselves. This album may satisfy a Shaun Cassidy fan because he has sooooo little material available. But if you are a david cassidy fan, I would look else where. I think David is great and he was great in the show, but the soundtrack is nothing great. Maybe I am looking at it from the wrong point of few but still, i really dont dig it. If u were a fan of the show itself dont listen to me, because I am an idiot, but other than that it is basically worth the two stars I gave it. Maybe 2.5 stars, but I cant do that. :) David is cool though, no matter what."
1,"What a horrible musical, what a horrible soundtrack","I saw this musical last year in London and could hardly contain my laughter due to the terrible acting, terrible story line, and equally terrible music. The soundtrack will make a nice white elephant gift for those who suffered through this one with me."
4,get this CD,"a couple of years ago i was able to see this show in london and it was fantastic. since then i have been kicking myself for not buying the cast recording there. but i just found the CD, not quite as good but still good. the songs are all great, so it makes it hard to choose a favorite. i recomend this CD to anyone who has seen the play, or even those who haven't because it is a great story with even better music."
3,You can get more for less!!,"The title of this book should be, ""VB for Dummies"", Yes, the book is OK! It is well written and easy to read. But if you are serious about really beginning VB, you might do yourself a favor and buy a thicker, cheaper book. It's true, you will have an vague idea of what VB does after reading this book but that's all! In a month or so, you will be back at the bookstore looking for another book."
3,Where's the beef?,"I read a few VB books, but this one really didnt go into much detail. I ordered 'Beginning VB6 Database programming' and it went though much more in a way I could understand. If I had to choose one for a beginner, it would be the database book. For sheer understanding - it tops the others Ive read."
2,Wouldn't recommend this book,This book covers databases in a very perfunctory manner and doesn't seem to mention the packaging and deployment wizard. I was not very impressed with it at all. I shall add books with the word 'step' on the cover to my list of books to avoid (along with any book with 'Days' in the title).
3,Not for complete beginners,"I sing praise to Microsoft's marketing department. To see how beginning VB should be taugh, buy John Smiley's ""Learn to Program with Visual Basic"". As with all of Microsoft's instructional material, it assumes that you have a solid knowledge of all computer terminology. There is also no stucture to their teaching methods. Many items, in particular ""coding"", are covered before many foundational items are explained. Buy this book for reference but not as a beginner."
2,Not Very Useful,"I purchased this book with the expectation of learning of Visual Basic. This expectation was not met. This book gives examples of programs for you to code but just tells you ""here is what to type"" and tells you EXACTLY what to do. This is all well and fine but it does not tell you WHY something happens or exactly WHAT something does. If you want to be a real coder, this book is NOT for you. Frankly, it was a waste of my money. However, I do recommend Visual Basic Controls In A Nutshell by O'Reilly Books."
2,Not Quite Ready for Vegas,"I am in perfect agreement with the Nashua reader below. I purchased this book within the Microsoft Deluxe Learning Edition for Visual Basic 6.0As far as programming goes, it seemed to leap into the ""how"" without first telling you the ""why"". And although I soon found myself writing code for cute slot machines and so forth, I didn't at all find it useful in terms of writing my own comprehensive code.I did learn a good deal as far as controls and interface...designing, that is. But I don't feel I got my money's worth at all in terms of learning any useful Visual Basic programming."
2,"Very very basic, it doesn't go into depth on anything","This book might be alright for the beginner but, if you are experienced in any other programming language just photocopy the 3 pages you might need, and buy a good book."
1,Much promise - no follow through,"As an experienced programmer looking to learn languages I do not regularly use, or asked to recommend a book to someone else for learning a new language, I look at many books. This book is bad. The author takes you by the hand and does everything for you. There aren't any exercises or review questions at the end of chapters. People don't learn that way. To learn something and keep it learned people must do something, perform an exercise, think through and solve a problem. This book isn't much better than a classroom lecture, or a TV show. This book does not make you think!"
3,Wordy,"I don't know why people think it's so cool. It's not bad, but it's too wordy and repetitive. And that kills the fun of programming. It talks too much instead of giving you chance to practice."
5,Superb step-by-step directions.,I have a modest background in programming but I wanted to get a strong refresher on the basics of VB 6 again so I picked up the first edition of this book. I haven't seen many other books which are as clearly explained and laid out as this one. The author knows how to teach. Every example was beautifully explained and left no question about how to proceed without being overly verbose. This book covers most of the procedures I'd probably need in day to day VB coding on the job. This is definitely recommended for conscientious beginners or those looking for a carefully written refresher. All code examples are included on the CD and although there were remarkably few typos there is an errata page available on the publishers website.
4,Fine for beginners,"This book is an excellent place to start for beginners to VB and beginners to programming in general. For those familiar with VB, the in-depth coverage of programming structures will seem a bit tedious. A big plus is that all of the sample code WORKS and the text seems to be free of errors and typos. The only thing that keeps me from rating this book more highly is that it teaches some programming practices that are a bit unsound--for example, not naming your controls appropriately and not using option explicit."
3,VB Step by Step doesnt teach good practices,"I have had some VB experience and wanted to see how the MS Press books stacked up to the other available texts. I was really disappointed. It is simply a case of trying to tackle too many concepts at one time. For the beginner I would strongly suggest going elsewhere to learn programming fundamentals. I was especially shocked to see how much the use of Variants was encouraged. The book gave only the most basic information on variable types and then never used them. If you are even thinking of moving on to another programming language after learning VB, avoid this book like the plague!"
3,Almost there,This book was headed for excellence until halfway through. As the subject becomes more difficult the author simply prints the code and has you open up and read the examples without fully explaining the code. Otherwise it was good for pure basics.
5,Excellent book!!,Very good examples. Even comes with CD so you can run the program and look at the code real time. The solutions are everyday answers to problems.
5,The Best VB BEGINNER book,"If you are new to programming, this book is great. I recommend that you buy a version of VB and work the examples that Halvorson carefully walks you through. If you are doing DB related programming, make sure you have the professional version, it has more DB and DHTML extentions. When you are finished with this book, you should be confident to take more steps, though you cannot expect to be a competent programmer - this book is a good springboard to more complex books on VB. The book does exactly what it claims: introduce you to VB, and have fun doing it."
5,"Great way to Learn VB, any beginner would love it","I am a freshman in High School and starting programming in C and C++ between the 8th and 9th grade. I moved to VB mid-9th grade and found this book explained everything and gave you enough information to write good, solid working programs. It showed that object oriented programs CAN be useful(even though C has more freedom). Any beginner wanting to learn VB should read this, it is very usingful."
3,Not the best to learn VB,"You will have fun in doing things step by step according to the book. However, you cannot really LEARN VB only depending on this book. After reading it, you will feel you learnred something, but you will aslo feel difficult to things your own. VB is not well explained in this book. This book is better regarded as a book demonstrating VB features. To learn VB, start with Peter Wright's Beginning VB. You may also consider to read Peter Wright's book first and then read this book."
3,Starts Great But Doesn't Follow Through,"This author does a marvelous job of ""teaching"" Visual Basic for about the first 11 chapters. However, like so many books I have studied, they stop teaching after the first 8-10 or 12 chapters. When the book progresses to the more complex areas of VB, this author like so many others, seems to be unable to follow through with the great ""teaching"" method with which he began. After chapter 11 the author simply proceeds to throw a bunch of unfamiliar code at you to ""study"". As if to say ""Hey, I'm tired of teaching this stuff. You are on your own. Here is a bunch of code, figure it out.""As great as this book started out, the last half of the book was equally disappointing."
4,Excellent book for experienced developers new to VB,"Coming from a Delphi applications developer background, I found this book easy to follow for my introduction to VB 6. I didn't realize how easy VB is to learn. This book is packed with information covering many topics including ADO and Active X controls, string handling, internet controls. Of course, the topics covered were just a taste and not indepth at all. It was just enough information to get your feet wet.Most of the chapters had applications to practice coding. However, there were several chapters that had sample applications but didn't have any practice code to type. He just went through the pre-written code and explained the key statements. It was more of a reference than actual typing and learning. This books isn't for beginning programmers. But it is a good transition book from other languages to Visual Basic. For my first Visual Basic book, I learned a lot."
3,Hit and Miss,"This is one of those books that is great for riding the subway or taking the bus. Nice short tidbits that are fascinating to read and many stick in the memory. My problem with the book is that there are some rather glaring errors. The first of which is the idea that Indians (people from India) were used as slaves in the United States. If errors like that pop up it makes me wonder what else in there is wrong. Even if the conclusions that Jack comes to are not the end all be all, they certainly do entertain and give food for thought. In many ways, the book is like a cultural history of England as well. I learned about as much about the idioms as I did about the lives of everyday people throughout the history of the British Isles."
4,Capturing English idiom in the wild: Red Herrings and White Elephants,"This book explores the origin of common phrases used in every day speech.Those reading the book should be aware that not all of the derivations presented are uncontested, and that a couple of the explanations seem truncated.For example, I would recommend that anyone who is interested in the origin of 'biting the bullet' needs to be aware that the underlying rumour was that the grease was made out of cow or pig fat. The cow is sacred to the Hindu and the pig is an unclean animal to the Muslim. Therefore whether Hindu or Muslim, they felt that they were being forced into a polluting practice. While it is possible that some of the cartridges were made with pig or bullock fat, the contractors had been instructed to use mutton.The book itself is an entertaining and easy to read addition to a reference library on English language.Recommended.Jennifer Cameron-Smith"
4,Phrase origins by British author,"Bought this for my husband for Christmas and he has really enjoyed it. The author is writing from a British perspective, however. Being American, some of the phrases aren't as familiar."
5,hear the most free thinking musicians of the 70's,"Unfortunately I could not make this concert as it was held in London at the Marquee, which as anyone who has ever been there knows held very few people. However the concert was repeated on June 6th at the Palace Theatre in Manchester, to which I had the pleasure of attending.Without doubt this has to be one of the best live albums ever made, not only for the fact that the music is outstanding, but mainly due to the fact that rarely can there have been a collection of such superb musicians on stage at one time! The lead guitarist (Ollie Halsall) and the base player (Archie Leggett) were at that time two of the most in demand session men in the country and this album features both men in their prime. If you dont buy another live album in your life, buy this one!!!!!!"
4,Foure great artists,"It is great to hear these four great artists together, live. I really like the version of Eno's ""Driving Me Backwards"" on this album. If you are a big fan of any of the four artists on thsi album (Nico, Eno, John Cale, and Kevin Ayers) I would say that you should counsider getting this album. If you are a big fan of more than one of them, then this is a must-have!"
5,At Long Last,"Finally ! If by some chance you missed this album when it came out- or played it into grooveless oblivion this really is the time to update your album to a CD. Cindy's advice is still as sage as it was almost 30 years ago, and well if you have made it through the 70s,80's and 90's you should still remember to when to say ""Thank You Very Much...Thank You Very Much !"
3,That guitarist was--,"--Mike Oldfield, not ""Brian,"" and yes he was and still is a master. Check out his own albums for better compositions. I just can't quite get into Nico's ""The End"" but am gonna hang with her a bit more on her other stuff. Cale's earlier solo stuff works better than here (try PARIS 1919 for artsy). Eno & Cale teamed on WRONG WAY UP, one of the most irresistible art-pop albums of all. Ayers: You're better off getting THE BEST OF-- ."
3,Cobalt coated bits,"I wish I would have read the description a bit better. I thought these were cobalt bits but they are only cobalt coated. Still a good deal but I never would have purchased them if I knew. BTW, I have how Amazon does not respect your privacy and unclicks your spam selections."
1,More Part Description is needed for this item,"As RC modelers we frequently find and use parts on our cars that were actually designed for a different specific model. The pilot shaft clutch is one of those items that is somewhat universal to many engine and clutch applications. However this item did not have enough information in it's description to help one determine if it was the correct size needed.This item needs to have added to it's description the engine sizes that it will fit, .10ci-.15ci. I needed one to fit engine size .21ci-.28ci. When I received the part, I quickly noticed that it was too small for my application. So I wasted time and money."
4,Takemitsu's art underscored by the visual to telling effect.,"This quiet man contrasted greatly with the intense music which heigtened the dramatic impact of so many Japanese films. Moreso than the great American and European writers of film music, he seemed to adapt style/instrumentation to suit movie content, though his perspective was always distinctive and personal. His appraoch may have derived from commitment to the cinemactic art form; he would immerse himself in the films for which he composed even during production so he himself was part of the creative process. Takemitsu's personality -- which apparently was calm, focused, serious, simple, honest -- emerges. The images which appear in the video are impressive. But they would be lessened without the memorable underscoring of Takemitsu's art. END"
2,Just not worth it...,"Having read the previous novels in this series, I thought Acorna would get more interesting as I read on. Now I really regret paying for this book, and unfortunately, I bought the rest of the series, too.Acorna's adventures always seem to end well, maybe too well for me. I was interested by the Linyaari initially, but in this book, I found them rather annoying, actually. Maati was the only character I found halfway endearing or even vaguely relateable. The older Linyaari made me mad for reasons I can't say, and frankly, I probably will only bother keeping this book as a reference until I can trade it at the used bookstore.Not worth the money!"
2,Predictable,"Acorna is a burst of sue-powered sweetness, and rescues her own alien-unicorn people from the evil Kisla, without ever being seriously challenged or in danger. The cat RK (roadkill) was amusing, but this book had little substance. Novel padded by extra scenes telling the reader exactly what the bad guys are doing, and why they are bad (suspense-killer). If you are in love with Acorna's character, go for it. If you want good plotting or interesting challenges, look elsewhere.For the Scarborough-McCaffery team writing well, tryPowers That Be (Petaybee, Book 1). Do not recommend this novel or series."
4,Lots of fun,"Besides a new planet full of unicorn-people, ""Acorna's People"" brings with it another introduction to the Acorna universe - a new co-author. And we can see it in the writing style. This book lacks the near-scientific plausiblity of the first two books that obviously came from mathematician-author Margaret Ball, but the introduction of the *wonderful* characters of Becker and Roadkill (the aspect of the book I loved the most) which I expect were largely Elizabeth Ann Scarborough's creations, made it a delightful read for me. I loved that their characters are continued into the following volumes.Love and Peace,Robert"
1,Not their best work...,"Unlike previous McCaffrey works, including the other two Acorna books, this book was not worth the time it took to read it. It is incredibly slow moving, with no definite plot pattern. For most of the book the reader waits and waits for something of interest to happen, until about the ten last pages, where the plot abruptly folds in on itself in a very quick and unsatisfing ending. It is almost as if the authors just got sick of writing. In addition to being boring, the action is confusing and difficult to follow. I can only hope that the next book in the series can make up for this poor excuse for entertaining literature."
4,Another Good One from Anne,Another good read from Anne McCaffrey. Not quite as action filled as some of her others but a good continuation of Acorna's life.
3,She's awful! He's amazing!,"It's kind of sweet how Martyn split two whole albums with his wife Beverley, even though she was a horrible, warbly folkie type. I guess she would have been OK putting out something on her own, but paired up with the gorgeous, sublime material that HE was doing at the time, her stuff seems like an irksome distraction. Still, this album is worth checking out for gems such as ""Traffic Light Lady"", one of Martyn's best ballad. They trade off evenly through the whole album -- his stuff is great, her stuff makes me grind my teeth."
5,awesome local crust,"These guys are the best DIY out of boston. their music is heavy and can be listened by punks and metalheads. tracks like ""junkie bastards"", ""allston violence"", ""believen"", ""the disappointment"", ""people suck"", ""politics"", ""parasite"" and ""drink"" are classics. if your from boston, you can always catch toxic"
3,Ok,"Book went along with story line from movie, but not very much detail in the pictures. I thought it would be more."
2,Yeah.... See!,"This was a very educational bio on the ruthless gangsters of the 1900's. Bugsy Siegel, Dutch Schultz, & Al Capone, are the high lights of this film. Bonnie & Clyde, was also mentioned. I gave the film two stars because of its aweful condition. The sound and picture wasn't great, but the information that I could make out; was very interesting. Should be recommend for school history papers, or school classroom viewing."
4,GOOD VIDEO ON THE KING OF THE RING,"IM A HUGE ROY JONES FAN, I REALLY CANT LOOK PAST ROY JONES JR WHEN IT COMES OT BOXING I LOVE THIS VIDEO IT HAS SOME GOOD INFO ON ROY JONES JR. AND I LIKE TO SEE THE WAY HE TRAINS!"
5,Wow,The fit and finish on this is perfect not one flaw. No fret buzz easy to bend notes.The neck is a little small for my med large hands. The guitar is heavy but i played for two hrs and was not tired or uncomfortable. The pickups are so so but at this price can't complain. I'd buy another agile
5,ONLY $225!,"This guitar is insane i was looking for an extremely long time for a descent guitar and i was on a low budget. after seeing this guitar i was hysterical! i originally found the guitar with P90 pickups which i didnt mind but i prefer the heavier stuff. after some searching i found this and its great. it is perfect for any type of music from heavy metal to annoying pop this guitar has a nice action that is extremely easy to adjust it has great sound, has a beautiful look to it, and on top of that is only $225 if you are looking for a good guitar but dont want to empty your wallet you'd be a fool not to get the Agile Al2000."
2,THIS IS A $200 GUITAR,Agile makes a very nice Les Paul copy for the money but do not be fooled by this extremely over inflated price tag.
1,Broken,I waited 11 days to receive this product and when it finally came the tab on the electric box was broken off the screw.
1,"NOT WATERPROOF, CAN'T BEND THE MOUNTING BRACKET","It can't be mounted on a motorcycle due to wet area to be mounted because it is not a potted sealed waterproof Relay. The mounting bracket is hard plastic and can not be bent for mounting in a tight place. The sellers don't have the commond sence to understand this?They send you what they want to send you, not what is advertized. They would rather just cost you time and refund your money than send you the correct part?I'm really a ""PRIME MRMBER"",Larry W. Jordan"
2,"Case is Flimsy, Failed Quickly","First, the price is certainly a deciding factor on this relay. Many people seem to have had success with these, but unfortunately mine failed very quickly. Utilizing it in the dashboard for a switching control, the relay wasn't subjected to any weather (except perhaps the normal high temperatures encountered in a car sitting in a parking lot!). The relay failed after a few weeks of use.Other observations, the case is built cheaply and doesn't seal at all. If the relay is mounted by the tab, the wires alone will cause the clip-in bottom component to wiggle with more play than I would normally be comfortable with. I don't believe there is much resistance to dust give then flex between the case cap and the bottom component where the wires are connected.My 2 cents, you can probably find a better relay elsewhere. It worked great while it was working and never got warm to the touch."
2,Nothing too special,It's a 12V relay. What more is there to say? I recommend spending around $2 more and buying one that comes with a harness.
3,Out of place.,"I'm just as much a fan of synth/progressive metal as the next, but I don't find Sigh to be up to level with my musical tastes. Unlike Tristania, where synths and violins intermix, Sigh rather plays the usual metal with occasional screaming then blasts the synth and makes it all seem out of place. A few of their songs at the end that are just synth are all right... Maybe buy the album just for Invitation to Die... But I suggest Dimmu Borgir, Tristania, Peccatum, In Flames, or even Naglfar instead. Sigh just makes me feel like they play music to play music, rather than feel the music to produce something that doesn't feel awkward. If the idea of out-of-place synth intruiges you, check it out for the hell of it anyway."
2,maybe you might like it.,"This surely is strange music,both metal, classic, and something else.Original indeed, but the efforts made to create such a music were not enough.The song are very different,so different that you get lost while listening.You might like one,two but probably not all of them.As I said,you might like it,but first listen to it(if you have a chance)"
1,Poor Return Policy,"The initial delivery time was great, very fast. However, when I had a problem with the dvd and sent it back for an exchange, I did not receive another dvd and am considering a full refund. The responses to my emails were not timely and a new dvd was assured to be sent but have not seen it in about a month. With so many choices out there, stay away from this place."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT,"Well this is the 2nd time ordering this product from this seller and well the first time i thought eh just a screwed up copy, 10 minutes in and it started skipping then just would not play, so returned it bought another one from the same seller and this one started skipping on the main menu and would not even play, very very very disappointed in the product and this seller...DO NOT BUY FROM THEM, THEIR PRODUCTS ARE CRAP!"
5,Madonna fights lady gaga and wins!,"Must see snl episode where madonna and lady gaga cat fight and Madonna wins, seriously, the second best show of the season, first being when everyones favorite golden girl got to host.Don't miss the laughs!"
2,Not the full episode :(,Gerard Butler's monologue has been cut out of this vid. I purchased it specifically for the monologue (because it was cut out of the vid on Hulu also) and was extremely disappointed that I wasted my $1.99. Otherwise a good episode.
2,How can you EDIT SNL?,"So I have to wonder...what happened to the monologue? That is kind of an important part of an snl episode, and yet here Amazon has EDITED it. ITunes, as well. So...wtf?"
1,monologue omitted.,"The Monologue is missing. very disappointed. I was hoping to watch the opeing Make Em Laugh number. Bummer , if you are wanting the entire episode be sure to check the other reviews before proceeding, i wish i did."
4,Wonderful,The sword is wonderful. It came in very good condition. With a little polished work this sword will be displayed nicely.
3,Good/Okay sword,This was the first sword I ordered on Amazon a few years back.I was ecstatic when I found it on my front porch.Though my reaction was TOTALLY opposite when it was unpacked.It was completely disappointing that the wrap was brown. What I was hoping for was the sword like in the picture and the color of the wrap would go well with my room. I felt completely ripped off with the false advertising.Though I decided to keep the sword since I felt the wrap and sword were well done...part of me still feels like I wasted my money.
3,useful addition to the literature,"This book is a useful addition to the literature--a more comprehensive book that also looked at practices outside the USA is what is really needed. That's one of the major drawbacks of this book, it doesn't clearly indicate that it is tracing an American history of the idea of site-specificity.The first chapter provides a short history of site specificity from an American point of view (minimalism, conceptual art's critique of institutions) and draws heavily on James Meyer's idea of the functional site to think about the present, after that the book is a series of case studies. A better book for considering the range and history of site specific practices (which includes this book's first chapter and Meyer's essay) is Erika Suderburg's Space Site Intervention. Also useful is Site-Specificity: The Ethnographic Turn."
2,One obscure word after another is more like it,"Miwon Kwon's writing is extremely wordy and very hard to grasp. You'll inevitably spend more time looking up her obscure vocabulary than actual reading. I found her writing hard to comprehend even after reading chapters multiple times. I'm a college level reader, and have experienced few problems understanding other art related readings. Her sentences are incredibly redundant and very hard to understand. Honestly, I would ONLY recommend this book to College Professors or anyone with a PHD; otherwise save your self the time and pass this one up. You'll be happy you did."
4,A great adventure starring a very small dragon :),"A policier story in a fantasy set. The results : outstanding.Liam Rhenford and his dragon Fanuilh carry a great gift for the dying king : an artifact of lost origins, a vial of the strongest remedy of all, the King's Cure.The problem is Liam has no idea of it and is caught in a maelstrom of treachery and death, as every door closes to him, he's marked as an assassin and murderer, and the dangerous Pacifex gets ever more close to him, her quarry.Liam can count only on Fanuilh's small powers, and on his extraordinary luck, to get through the three days following his arrival, until traitors are exposed and all plots come to light.I couldn't let this book down until I'd finished it... I'm going to search for more :)This is superb fantasy - even if small scale. But who needs and epic tale when this is available?Read it!! You won't regret it a bit."
2,Charger might work....if you tape in the battery!,"The battery charger doesn't have any way to hold the battery in it...the battery slides around (and off the charger) if it is moved at all. I wrapped a velcro strap around the battery to hold it in, but have not tried to actually charge a battery with it. I will try to update, but the lack of any type of battery retention is an absurd shortcoming, regardless of whether the charger works."
3,We sent this as a gift.,This was a gift sent to our grand-daughter for her 5th birthday. As far as we know she likes the book.
5,"Heartsfield's Second Album, As Great As The First","THE WONDER OF IT ALL [SIGNATURE SERIES], Heartsfield's second album, is just as good as the debut, with no trace of the dreaded sophmore jinx to be found. This CD draws on such influences as Poco, the Eagles, Pure Prairie League, the Allman Brothers Band, J.J. Cale, and many others, with a perfect blend of acoustic and electric instrumentation and great vocal harmonies. If you love Marshall Tucker or the Outlaws, you'll love Heartsfield."
5,The In door noisy book,"My husbands little girl used to say ""noooooooooooooo"" along with the questions in the book. She was killed by a drunk driver as a young adult and the memory of this book-A Father with his little blonde haired angel in his lap laughing and reading together is priceless. It was great for interaction."
2,Poor Quality,"I purchased this plate as a replacement for one I broke. In my opinion, a particular charm of this design is the subtle variation among the colors and the shading. The plate I bought, while it used the same colors, was garish and too bright, with inferior shading and a thick border around the edge. It does not really resemble the plate I broke. If I need more replacement pieces in the future, I will be sure they are made in the USA, not China. Amazon and its supplier were prompt and reliable, but the product was not the quality I expected from Pfaltzgraff."
5,T. Martin,"if you collect these you know what to expect....no surprises....nice plates, no problems with shipping"
1,I found a mistake too,"Same Chapter ""The Sophistcated Shopper""Copenhagen, Denmark - Bang and Olufson Stereo equitment. WRONG! No Sophistated person purchases those Stereos over in Denmark unless they LIVE in DENMARK, because if you bring it back to the States - IT WON'T WORK. The components are NOT compatible with the United States. If you were foolish enough to take the books advice and to buy a stereo over there, you would have to bring it to a Bang and Olufson store in New York City, and have them rebuild it to make it compatible, and the cost for that would be about the same price as what you paid for the stero it's self. Be SMART. If you want a Bang and Olufson Stero, by it here in the States. Every major city has a Bang and Olufson store and they cost just as much here as they Do in Denmark. So Save you money. Also, Geog Jensen silver can be purchased at most upscale department stores, therefor you won't have to pay the ""Customs"" tax when you re-enter the country."
1,Can you say cheese?,I have to say this is a quite ridiculous book. I especially enjoyed Ms./Mr. ALMODOVAR's review which was very entertaining. I also found it interesting that the best reviews were placed by individuals who also did not know how to spell. Hmmmm. Be very careful and don't think reading this will really supplement your lifestyle.
1,It was wonderful until it wasn't.,"I bought 3 of these for various girls in my life (ranging in age from 7 to 11). Only one has held up to any type of use. Two of the others died the first time out of the box, the other one died on the third pot. My daughter's is still going strong but she's only made one pot because the clay dried out in the box even though it was wrapped in what I thought was air tight packaging. We just ordered the refill and will see if it can hold up to pot number 2"
1,Badly built and not accurate,It is flimsy. The needle will move around even though nothing is happening to the gauge. The readings seem to vary wildly.I would not buy this again and wish I hadn't wasted the money to begin with.
5,Solid!,Well made and sturdy. Should hold up for years to come. Good addition to any garage. I would definitely buy another if I had to.
1,"Worked for 2 sessions at the track, and then failed.",Bought this over the winter to replace a lost Longacre tire pressure gauge. I was pleasantly surprised by the look and the feel. I brought it to a track event and the gauge worked for 2 sessions and then started showing 10psi less than the actual pressure.Threw it out.Amazon should remove this and exclusively sell longacre pressure gauges.
2,Jar is more convenient than a mesh bag.,"This product did not have the sucking power I thought it would have. As someone else said, the nozzle has to be lower than the hose. In my fish pond, getting this accomplished was almost next to impossible, especially in the lower end of the pond. The container, however, is more convenient than a mesh bag."
2,Pond vacuum ?,"This just didn't work for me. Its not practical enough. It doesn't clean well the pond , with all the string algae filled. Please try something else."
1,I'd rather give this product NO stars!,This product is over priced because it doesn't work...The hose kinks and it doesn't hold suction...[...]
3,Get one with C or D batteries!,"These are nice, they make mosquitos POP when you zap them.However, if you're one of those who likes to have fun when you kill bugs, get one with either C or D batteries. They carry MUCH more power and will kill things like Cockroaches which AA battery-powered swatters will not."
1,Waste of money,"I had a different brand that was a gift and had worked great for over 2 years. It got damaged so I looked for a replacement. My friends asked me to order them each one also (5 in all). They arrived, looked great in the package. When they were unwrapped we found that all 5 were poorly constructed. All of them had at least 1/3 of the wire grid that was not in place or the wire was too short to go all the way across. None of them worked. This is the worst constructed product I have ever purchased online. I do nearly all my shopping online, with the exception of groceries. 1 Star is too high a rating for this Bug Zapper...."
4,Interesting volume,I love reading about how early settlers and even those before that in other countries cured their ailments with natural remedies. This book is quite thorough and very informative.
3,ho-hum?,"The opener of this album is truly stunning, with a great piano solo, opening into a melancholy but still heavy, very moody track, with haunting clean vocals, accentuated by a choir like backing. Some of the vocals are done in the kind of power metal vein (i.e. iron maiden, iced earth) which isn't something I particularly like, and in some places I feel it doesn't really fit the music. And the music. Well, it is not exactly extreme. The drums play a generic rock beat most of the time, and the guitars, apart from a few quite crunching riffs, are not entirely at the forefront of the music. Some of this actually sounds like Metallica. But Paradise Lost really shine through on a few tracks with awesome doomy tracks, anguished vocals, haunting backings, very slow drums, and an all over melancholy feel. I can't really decide if I love this one or not...."
1,Do not buy from this seller,"We still have not received our item. After numerous tries to contact the seller, we still have not received a response except for an automated email. My son picked this item for his fathers birthday present. I have a very upset 5 year old who continues to ask (since August) when his flag will be delivered."
4,Good summer cookout music!,"Definitely a good cd for a summertime get together, although the version of Macarena is not the original. The other songs are an excellent, though eclectic choice of old standard sing-alongs that everyone can enjoy!"
1,It's broken;(,"I was really looking forward to watching this DVD with my kids on Tom & Jerry Movie Night. Unfortunately, I received it broken. I plan on reordering another one from a different company from Amazon because I love T&J cartoons and they sell them cheap here. Amazon gave me credit on it so I look forward to buying another one."
3,Good CD,"No Complaints really. This is an excellent album, however, I had the same problem as some other people here, I only recieved a 9 track 30 minute album. Whatever though those are 9 very good tracks. But beware that can happen."
4,A very good book,"I found this book to be very easy to read, and it added new insight to ""The Course in Miracles."" It shows how the Course can be applied to everyday life by the way the author uses it in her own daily life."
5,Wonderful,"Marianne Williamson is wonderful and certainly gives food for thought. Will be on my shelf and read and reread many times over. Though it is an old book, the contents/premises will never be out-dated."
3,the hubbub eludes me,"marianne says some truly beautiful (and obviously true) things in this book. i dont know that i would recommend reading the book tho to get to those gems.at times the book is repetitive and comes across to me as preachy. a little ""rambly"" (if thats a word) too. i am certain the repetitiveness was a deliberate decision on the authors part (to stress a point); i simply found it unnecessary and ... uh ... distracting.""a return to love"" didnt live up the *buzz* i have heard about it. it may help some ... it may inspire others. for me it profoundly did neither.i predict that within 6 months i will have forgotten that i have actually read this book. this review will serve as my reminder that i did....and that is not good for a book that is meant to return me to love. :("
2,The Importance of Love,"This book talks about the importance of love and forgiveness, using ""A Course in Miracles"" as a basis for its explanations.The message in this book seems good. In a perfect world, there would be all love and forgiveness to all mankind, and then everything would be all perfect (but then again, if it were a perfect world, there would be no sin and no need for forgiveness). The book just seems to superficial to me.Don't get me wrong - the message about love was good, and I agreed with most of what the book says. I do believe that love is powerful and we need more love and forgiveness. I just wish it was as easy to have it as this book lets on.I felt too much information was given from ""A Course in Miracles"" rather than from the author herself (most every page had a reference to ""A Course in Miracles""); that's why I couldn't give the book more than 2 stars. Also, the book was unnecessarily drawn out; the point was gotten on a quarter of the pages."
4,A Return to Love,"This is an excellent treatment of the metaphysical principles in learning your true self image and gaining a sense of loving oneself in a return to traditional principles of Love, God. Ms. Williamson has a wonderful approach and discussion about how she returned to her true self, her true center, as the expression of God."
4,Good feeling book,"I think some books reach you at the right time and for the right reason. I enjoyed this book entirely, it helped me in situations I was living, because I felt a positve change by applying what I graspped from this book.In my case, I am not a religious person, and I don't know the truth about so many questions we as humans have, but I think that the feelings of love, forgivenes, peace, and not judgement are much more powerful than any theory. To me this book directs you towards that sublime path of love. Truly after reading the book, you feel in peace, and see things differently in your life.I admmit I still have some questions about certain situatinos of every day life, but I just finished reading the book, so I trust I will learn along the way, and I will re-read the book to catch more."
5,One of the best books I've ever read.,"This is one of the best books I've ever read-(and I've read many, many books). A Return to Love will change for the better the way you see the world and yourself.What prompted me to write this review, though, was the comment by a previous reviwer that A Return to Love ""distorts Christ's teachings"". This position implies and assumes that one particular interpretation of Christ's teachings is 'the truth' and anything that disagrees with that is false and wrong. Traditional church Christianity does not own the sole rights to the interpretation of Christ's teachings. In fact, it should be noted that traditional Christianity's interpretation of Christ's teachings was made by people who thought the world was flat and regularly stoned women to death.A Return to Love presents a far more loving, compassionate and insightful interpretation of religous writings than does traditional religon. It is highly recommended."
5,Highly Recommended,This book provides a general overview of what the Course in Miracles teaches. Marianne Williamson summarizes the main core of the course in a very inspirational and realistic way. I highly recommend this book.
5,i have a problem,hi guys. how can i buy this book? i just can not buy amazons audib. books for my kindle 3 g kindle...i close my eyesi feel your presence
1,"No Sin, No Consequences, No Hell, And More New Age Lies","This book is just another New Age manual designed to keep you destined for Hell. It denies the truth of Christ and props up a false 'Christ' in its place. It does us by telling us there is no such thing as sin, (so rape, steal, lie and murder as you please!) thus no need for salvation. The Bible warned us that there would be many false 'Christs' before His return. Read the Bible (King James Version) for the Truth."
5,Great Read,This book led me to The Course. The author's reflections and insight are beautiful and I highly recommend this book to anyone looking for the truth about yourself and everyone you encounter.
5,It has changed my life,"I couldn't understand ""A Course in Miracles"" but I could understand ""A return to Love"". It made it very easy for me. I'm reading it for a second time and paying very close attention to the lessons. It has changed my way of thinking and my life. I am very happy. If everyone read this book, the world would be at peace."
2,Return to Love: Reflections on the Principles of a Course in Miracles,"I was somewhat disappointed as the book was filthy and either blood stains or catsup stains were on several of the pages. It was a signed book, as indicated. I did,however, have more writing and notes and underlines on the pages than I anticipated. It appears to have been on the shelf for a very long time."
5,THIS BOOK CHANGED MY LIFE,"I first read this book in 1993 after seeing Marianne Williamson on Oprah. I could feel the warmth and love coming from this woman on the TV. This was a very difficult time in my life. This book helped me look at myself, but most importantly, to look at others in a different light and with a loving eye. I learned how to stop blaming people for my failures and how to see my failures and experiences as valuable lessons. This ""Course in Miracles"" has truly made me recognize the miracles that occur in my life daily. I wish I could personally thank Marianne Williamson."
5,I cannot say enough great things about this book. Life Changing...,"When I opened this book, I could not put it down. So inspirational and uplifting. You will love this book...I say get it quick fast and in a hurry if you're looking for peace of mind."
5,Reorder,Read this book 20 years ago...it was time again for a refresher Course. This book so helpful for a happy life.
4,Reflections on Reflections,"While I usually prefer to read from the original author, Marianne Williamson does make it more practicle to be able to contemplate and absorb some important components of A Course in Miracles. In fact, her book is a great introduction to A Course in Miracles which is extremely complex and therefore one can more easily enjoy some or all of A Course in Miracles. Its a perfect version to have in your car or beside your bed."
2,Sounds familiar....,"I'm a former Christian Scientist who picked up this book out of curiosity. I'd say a full three-quarters of the book's basic philosophy is lifted right out of the Christian Science ""textbook"" -- Science and Health, by Mary Baker Eddy.Ms. Williamson's book is a nice, frothy milkshake -- a New Age, feel-good blend of pop psychology and secular spirituality that goes down very easily. From what I can gather from the book, it sounds as if the folks who concocted A Course in Miracles studied the Science and Health, rewrote the Victorian language so that it was contemporary and appealing, and left out all the hard, controversial stuff -- like relying solely on God for physical healing.Hmm. All I can say is: give me good, old-fashioned, traditional, church-going religion. That's where you get to know God -- AND yourself."
2,BORING,"IF you're in any 12 step recovery program this book is blah blah blah bc you're already lived it. That being said, I haven't read the whole thing - maybe it gets better later on, i'm not dying to find out..."
1,Don't Waste Your Money or Time - This is Pure Trash,"My sister asked me to read this book so that I would understand her ""value system"". I started reading it and became very concerned for my sister. I tried and tried to choke down the garbage being spewed in this book, but finally had to put it down. What I did get out of the book is a huge sense of pity for the author, whose life is obviously a great disappointment to her, despite her ramblings about love, hallucinations and the universe.There are many references to biblical passages and theories, and I found myself keeping my bible beside me as I read it so that I could check the references. I would say that 95% of the references are either distorted or completely wrong. I couldn't figure out why someone would not just read the bible and take it at face value, if they were truly looking for a ""peace that transcends all understanding.""Don't be fooled by this wolf in sheep's clothing. Stick with the real thing and read the bible."
1,dodged a bullet,"I must admit that I only read the forward and it was enough to raise an eyebrow. I am an escapee from a reglious cult and I know what a cult leader sounds like. Marianne Williamson pelts her readers with how awful things are, how we hate ourselves, what a mess we've made and what a crisis we are in. I was fed that same garbage when the cult was trying to ""show me the way to happiness."" In one paragraph, she states: We obsess. We over eat. We hide. We co-depend. We drink. We do drugs. We control. on and on..... Who's ""we"" Kemosabe? I'm by no means perfect, but I don't do those things. I thank everyone who commented - it saved me from buying her books."
5,A Return To Love: Reflections on the Principle of A Course In MIracles.,Read this book twice. Great Book! This book should be required reading in CIM groups! All Williamson's books are excellent.
5,Amazing read.,"Incredibly insightful. Clearly written. Explained deep spiritual principles in simple language. Every time I read, even it it was just a few pages, I took away so much and the concepts stayed with me throughout the day."
5,A Return to Me!,This book reminded me of who I AM! It guided me back to my source of LIFE. A Great Read!
1,New Age Nonesense,"Marianne Williamson is a New Ager who has found a way of capitalizing on troubled people by distorting the Bible using the book, ""A Course in Miracles"" as her guide to leading them to enlightenment. As an out of work actress her philosphy first appealed to the Hollywood Wackos and by word of mouth spread to the mainstream of society. Too bad Amazon doesn't have -0- star ratings. Don't waste your money on the gobbledegook."
1,A Return to Love,"Unreadable & unrateable. It is pap of the worst order & seems, mainly, to be a review of another book. Where was it rated ""#1 Bestseller""?"
1,Maybe I missed the point?,Terrible at best. Ms. Williamson needs to look into her own life before giving advice to others.
4,True human exposure,"A very good book that allows the author to share her wounds with us, and this allows us to be truer to ourselves. It also gives us an insight on how to apply the principles of A Course in Miracles. Also, I highly recommend: Luminous by Peter Quest and Conversations with God."
5,a return to love,"good book. i love the way marianne expresses herself and her experiences which helped me, again, to realize that i'm not alone and that love is all there is."
4,A return to love,"I am not finished' please return to where I stopped. I have enjoyed the book so far however, I am only 49 percent complete. It shut down yesterday because it about of battery life."
3,Return to Love,Downloaded this after seeing Marianne on Oprah's Super Soul Sunday.It's a good self help book.A lot of it seems like common sense.
1,Waste of money,"This product, while attractive, could not stand up to remotely normal wear and tear and one day I caught it on something and it completely stretched out and was ruined. I wear bracelets all the time and never saw such a thing. Don't buy it."
3,Only the JLH songs are special,"This CD is a fair representation of a live concert in the mid-seventies when JLH sat in for a few songs at the end of the night. The crowd is enthusiastic and the energy from the band is high, but the only really standout tracks are the last three, featuring John Lee Hooker. Canned Heat plays a decent back-up role to a true legend and they swing and groove and growl well enough. Nothing earth-shattering, but there are some very enjoyable moments. The best aspect of this disc is the very palpable sense of atmosphere conveyed through a pretty well recorded gig. Simple, party type blues/rock, but JLH adds some magic."
2,No Hooker or Heat,"Don't be fooled like I was- John Lee Hooker only plays on the last few songs of the album. I got the album hoping to hear the following Hooker & Heat collaborationHooker 'n Heatbut it ended up being an uninspired concert put on by Canned Heat. I like Canned heat, but the album shouldn't have been titled Hooker 'n Heat if Hooker only briefly showed up. Don't buy this one expecting to hear much of the Hook."
4,Good general reference,"This book was a good general reference on Northern Italy. There were lots of good pictures and description of places and sites. There was also an extensive section on Northern Italian culture, which is good per people who would like to ""experience"" Italy rather than just blow through on a site seeing trip. However, don't look for listing about specific hotels or restaurants in this book. However, this would be an excellent for anyone planning a trip to Northern Italy."
4,The second best dayton family CD,"Every time I listen to it is perfect, it just isn't anywhere near as memorable as F.B.I.4 1/2 stars"
4,Real!,"When I first saw the promos for the Dayton Family's debut video and album I told everyone I'm getting that album. I wasn't disappointed at all. Everysong on this disc is real and straight to the damn point. F.B.I. was a better album, but this one cannot be overlooked as these young nigga's told a story about life in the hood of Flint was real!"
4,2 Hard 4 Punks,I got this cd after I got FBI. Although most rappers dont have Very good first cd's TDF is an exception. I left a star off cause there are only half a cd of good songs but be assured that these songs are hits. Worth the buy over and over.

5,furgy62,"Great book. This is a first hand account of life in the little known Special Boat service. I had heard of the SBS, but very little is known about this counterpart of the SAS. Although there were somethings the author could not elaborate on, this is completely understandable due to security reasons. Having said that this is a great read on the author's personal experiences in the SBS. I would recommend this book to anyone who wants to read about the british special forces who have a wealth of experience on the world's stage."
4,First Into Action,"Not nearly as detailed as a lot of other books of this true stories of the special forces genre, but interesting none-the-less. I would recommend it to people (like me) who have never read about or heard of the SBS. It's a fairly quick read and won't take up much of your time. Besides, the author has some pretty amusing anecdotes."
5,A great read,Being an x bootneck and having little knowledge of the sbs. I jumped at the chance to read this. I loved it from start to finish. Read it in two days. Interesting funny loved the characters. The bit i found really interesting was when he was sent to 42 cdo. I was in 40 cdo and met an sbs guy who was sent to our unit for eighteen months. He said very little about their training but brought untold amount of experience to our troop.
1,You get what you pay for,"This thing does what it is supposed to do - it charges your Creative Zen Vision. But it creates a horrible hum. Maybe it's just my crappy wiring job, but I didn't have this problem with the more expensive version that was stolen from my car."
3,Good but not recommended for kid's use,My 3 years old son accidentally broke one while eating his cereal and the pieces are very sharp. I don't recommend for kid's use.How about the $51 List Price?
2,Great Writing; Terrible Story,"I adored The Terror by Dan Simmons. Despite a few unbelievable scenes in The Terror, I was intrigued enough by it to cast my luck with another novel by Dan. Carrion Comfort by the back sounded like just the story. What I got was great writing and a disappointing story. The most interesting character was Melanie because she truly was psychopathic and horrible to those whom she Used. All the other characters, which are beautifully drawn, are completely unbelievable. The plotting is crazy; pacing irregular. The situations are preposterous and unreal and kept jarring me out of the reader's trance. I was thoroughly disgusted by this book, so much so that I haven't even finished the last 100 pages. As for people complaining the book is too long, I agree. Not because there are too many pages to turn, but because there are too many pages of a disappointing story."
2,Not as good as everyone was saying,"This book was very dissappointing....reading the reveiws i was hoping it would be a good book. This is my first time reading this authour. The book was a hard read, I had to try really hard to make myself read it. There were alot of dragged out parts in book and was very boring. The book could have easily been 400 pages. Read at your own risk."
2,If this is what horror fiction is then I pass,"I read Simmons other work of Horror ""Song of Kali"" and thought that it was ok. So I tried another one of his works. Carrion Comfort was supposed to be a magnum opus and at over 800 pages it was certainly an opus. Unfortunately the book, while having a great premise devolves into predictable and repeated acts involving knives, guns, and body parts to the point of nausia. The first use of each of these devices is clever and interesting however repeated use dulls the effect and drags the story out too long. This would have been a superior 300 page book if only the author and the editor could control themselves. While not the Heavens Gate of books, a very weak, predictable ending and too much racist overtones -- yes racist -- makes this book one to pass on.I am finished reading Simmons, now and for a long time. If this is what passes for the genre, then you can keep it. Sorry to be harsh but I would not waste your time here."
2,Well written but a disapointing story.,"Okay, the biggest problem I had with this novel has nothing to do with Dan Simmons and everything to do with the person who decided to include the SF Chronicle blurb on the front which says ""in the tradition of King's ""The Stand."" That is why I bought the book. Turned out that it wasn't ANYTHING like ""The Stand,"" not even close. I think Simmons is a great writer, but I was terribly disapointed with this book. Maybe if I hadn't known anything about I might not have had expectations I might have enjoyed it more. Or perhaps if someone had edited out about 100 pages I might have enjoyed it more. That said, I am still quite impressed with Simmons' writing and will continue to read other novels he has written. Unless, of course, someon lies on the cover of the paperback..."
1,Only reading it because I am past my delivery due date,"Boooo-rinnnngg. Can you say Dean Koontz with an even bigger ego and smaller imagination? This was recommended to me highly. I wonder why. I am only reading it because I am waiting for labor to begin and have time on my hands. This is a path-of-least-resistance, lowest-common-denominator book with a mildly interesting premise. Flat characters, some are even charicatures, and the violence is so pervasive that one becomes immune to it very quickly. Like a Stallone film. High cheese factor, too. Maybe I'll pick up Pride and Prejudice again. Or read the side of a cereal box."
1,What's the point?,"A reviewer below stated that in all other books before Carrion Comfort the characters ""seemed so flat."" Well I guess that's what happens when you move your reading level up a notch from the Sweet Valley High series. This book was boring and pointless."
1,"is this really the same author who wrote ""Drood""?","I loved Drood. It was one of my favorite books last year. This, however, is not. I've made it to page 352 and it's not going to get any betterMost of the other reviewers have a different view so I just wanted to add my one star opinion."
1,waste of time,"shallow one sided boring characters, a predictable plot, and snail's pacing make for one nightmare of a book...not to mention how long it is...skip over this one, go make talk with a tree, you will have a much better time. Especially dissapointing, since Mr. Simmons' other works are so good..."
3,Not as good as i had hoped,"After really liking Song of Kali and Summer of Night i had really high expecations for Carrion Comfort, until i got a few hundred pages into it and realized what a boring book it was. Really, it became painful to read and i finally had to just put it down because i didn't care anymore. I cannot BELIEVE Simmons devoted whole chapters to a tedious Holocaust backstory told in first person. People don't talk like that! People do not relate a story ""prose-style"" to another person without interruption for an hour! Not to mention is recall of detail from events from 40 years ago would have been frighteningly photographic memory. The book is just far, far too long at 900 pages. Chop it down to 450 and he would have had a much faster paced and interesting piece of work."
5,Excellent horror novel about true evil.,"Its a long, involved story about people with the ability to control other people with their mind. Doesn't sound that interesting does it? Don't let the premise fool you, it really is scary and intense--these characters are complete monsters and sociopaths. Dan Simmons is a talented story teller and shows us how absolute power corrupts absolutely."
2,Totally not what I expected!,It is so badly written...I do not find it entertaining and I surely think that this is his worst book. I do hope he'll improve.
3,mixed feelings on this book,"After reading a few reviews of this book, I see that most people either loved it or hated it. I guess I fall somewhere in the middle. While Simmons does a pretty good job of developing characters, I feel that the story they are placed in tends to drag a bit. Melanie is by far the most complex character of the book, however, I went back and forth between whether I should pity her or hate her. The book is quite long and easily could have been pared down a little to make it flow better. The final scene is somewhat confusing and pointless as well. But, as a whole, I didn't dislike this book. Just expected it to grab my attention a little better than it did. I have read one other Simmons book, Hyperion, and found it a bit more enjoyable a read. As for a horror epic, I would lean toward McCammon's ""Swan Song"" or King's ""The Stand"" over this effort."
3,"Decent book, better than Koontz, not as good as King","The premise is interesting and the first 3rd of the book is great. The rest is alright, worth finishing. Its not particularly scary."
3,Someone Needed to Edit This Behemoth!,"I love to read and I love a long *well written* book. One of my favorite books is Stephen King's, ""The Stand."" Stating that up front because I don't want you to think I am adverse to long books. On the contrary... That said, this story would have been much more enjoyable to read with 1/3 to 1/2 of it cut out. Finishing this book became a chore I was determined to accomplish, especially since I love Dan Simmons. I finished it out of pure stubbornness! Descriptions go on and on until you are reading only the first sentence of each paragraph just to plow through. There was no surprise at the end. The characters were mildly likeable and interesting, but this is a rambling drawn out story. Great story concept, but those who said it was too long were right on target!"
3,I THOUGHT THIS WAS GOING TO BE ONE OF BEST,"In the first 200-300 pages, I thought this might possibly be the best book I ever read. Then, the book turned from a horror book to a predictable ""clive cussler"" adventure - without the genius writing. The last 500 pages were truly boring. The author had a great thing going - at least for a while."
1,Not what I expected,"I bought this book based up glowing reviews and the fact that it had won the Bram Stoker award.The author introduces far too many characters at once and too quickly at that. No development or backstroy is given due to this. The description are overly detailed regarding the most mundane and pointless thingsThe characters are dull flat, and boring. They speak as if they were high class sophisticated nobles and because of this I was unable to relate to or even care about any of them. He tries so hard with cliches and sobstories to make us care about them but it's too easy to see through it.The plot was much too predictable and only now do I see why it was about 900 pages. Simmons goes on and on without getting to the point or even having one in the first place. It could have been done in half the length and been better off for it."
2,You can probably skip this one...,"'Summer of Night' was one of the best horror stories I had read in a long time. You can imagine my disappointment, then, when I tried to tackle 'Carrion Comfort.' And I really do mean tried. I slugged through about half of this autrocity, but then realized that I really could care less if everyone in the entire world died in the end, and humans vanished from existence. Very, very boring."
2,Did I miss something?,"I read this book due to the numerous great things I have heard about it. What a waste this book was. It could have been done in half the pages. It still wouldn't have been that good but at least I wouldn't have wasted as much time reading it. If you are looking for an epic novel of horror, look elsewhere!!!!!"
2,Desperately needs editing - but riveting story,"This is a real page-turner, for two reasons. One, the storyline is riveting. Two, the book is so bloated with overly-long scenes and dialog that I'm reading it as fast as I can turn the pages -- just skimming.In a long, whiny introduction to the 20th anniversary edition, Simmons complains at length about his travails in first getting this published. He says that it was enormous but that his agent encouraged him. After said agent and publisher went bankrupt, the new publisher wanted to (gasp) edit it! I didn't read all the details of his complains -- this part needs editing, too -- but this is the gist of it.)Well, someone should have edited this book to about 1/3 of what it is. Maybe 1/5. I'm reading it on Kindle so I don't know how many pages it is, but it's A LOT.It's a good story weighed down with too many words. A scene that could have been a couple of pages goes on for pages and pages and pages. So skim it, get the story, skip the extra."
3,Kindle Edition Has Real Problems,"The story is fine and plenty of people have left good reviews of it. My comments are in regards to the kindle edition, specifically the formatting and readability. It is terrible!The text has obviously been translated from another format, and someone didn't pay attention. Every few pages you will come across words that have spacing in the middle of words were they would be hyphenated, but no hyphens. For example, ""It simi lar to this sen tence."" It can become maddening, like the drip of a water facet.The story is good, but I would not have purchased the book, if I had known of the formatting problems. This is the first Kindle book I have read with these issues."
4,Interesting,Pick this up if you want a long book to read. The story is great and the ending will surprise
3,Long winded story that could be told with less effort.,"At about 900 pages, you would think is book is an epic spanningmany generations. It is, however, a relatively simple StephenKing-ish story of ""mind Vampires"" who, instead of sucking blood,thrive on violence and death. None of the characters are verylikeable, and the story just goes on and on, into areas that Ibelieve could have been cut out. I like Dan Simmons style, buthere he's just not editing himself. His other book, Hyperion, isa much better read."
5,The old man and the sea,"This is by far the best book it has ever been my great pleasure to read, not just read, but truly enjoy"
3,Old man,"The price and quality of the book was fair. I do recommend this book I just felt it was hard to get into, but a good classic."
4,4 AM alone makes this CD worth it,"I'm a big Kaskade fan and this CD is probably the most consistent he has done. With the deep house synths and choruses he definitely steps it up in the anthemic department, and produces some truly transcendent moments. 4 AM and Distance in particular are just beautiful songs. If you have ever been separated from your significant other Distance will be quite poignant. And I think 4 AM may be one of my top 10 songs ever. Every remix and breakdown of it is great. Kaskade is blazing a trail and I hope he can resist the lure of true dance music superstar, because that usually involves descent into trance, crowd pleasing generica. Kaskade is unique and soulful, and some of his best moments are captured here. Also, check out the video of 4 AM filmed with a live band, I got it from itunes. EPIC."
4,wonderful summer afternoon beach music,"the track 'In this Life' prompted me to buy this album - what a pleasure. Beautiful tracks - nice vocals. The listed tracking on the cd package is wrong but other wise, a nice treat."
2,1/2 full?,I guess I expected the little vial to at least be full instead of only 1/2 full. Is that really what an ounce looks like?
5,Give Us Back Moonlight,"It's hard to believe that CBS cancelled ""Moonlight"", especially since the Viewer's Choice Award voted ""Moonlight"" as the favorite new series of the Season.The Finale was extremely passionate and made us want to tune in to the next Season.CBS--we are trying to tell you something; we think that you should listen. (Also, you've taken ""Without A Trace"" away from the time slot after ""CSI"" on Thursdays at 10:00--what is that about???)""Moonlight"" was probably my most loved TV program since ""LaFemme Nikita"" on USA a few years ago.I do hope that you, CBS, will listen to your viewers. We truly love ""Ghost Whisperer,"" we loved ""Close to Home"", which was cancelled, and we love ""Numbers""."
5,"I JUST FOUND OUT THE SHOW WILL NOT BE RENEWED! DARN, DARN, DARN!!!","I'm really devastated! The cancellation of this show will take a while to get over!!! The EXCELLENT ""Moonlight"" is one of three shows that I truly look forward to seeing each week. Now, I'm getting nervous that there might not be a DVD of the first season!For me, Friday night network television was redeemed with the addition of ""Moonlight,"" and I guess it's now back to cable for me. Goodbye, Mick and Beth, I'll miss you terribly!"
5,Really good,I watched this series when it was on CBS. I was very disappointed that it was canceled. This way I have it to watch any time I please. Alex has now moved on to another series on CBS and I wish him great success!
5,Why I Love This Show So Much,"I love ""Moonlight"" because it is mature, gripping and romantic. It starts out a little slow in the first few episodes but gains a lot of ground quickly with peeks at the backstories of each character, some of which have historical significance. ""Moonlight"" also has the cajones to break with the Buffy-verse by creating it's own vamp rules and focusing on characters that are slightly older than high school/college age. Even if the show isn't picked up by any other network after CBS' thickheaded decision to cancel it, I'm sure it will live on for many years in fanficdom. Pick up a copy of the DVD set when it comes out and you will know what all the fuss is about."
5,Moonlight - The complete series,"I was thrilled to purchase this. I was so upset when it was cancelled, but now I can watch it anytime. Very prompt delivery, brand new."
4,Not even close to Supernatural...,"This show cannot begin to compete with Supernatural, but it is better than most TV shows. Too much 'love interest.' The format is formulaic and the writing is predictable. Mick's friend, Josef, is a really good character, and I would rather see his role expanded. All said, though, the show is, sadly, better than most TV seen these days."
1,I like this show better...,"when it was 'Angel' or better yet 'Forever Knight'. I am also amused/disturbed that there are calling this a new wave of ""vampires"". Pray tell when has the vampire vanished from the media? Of all the things that go bump in the night, the vampire reigns supreme. This show aims high and falls flat. The allusions to Louis, Angel and even the vampires from 'Forever Knight' and 'Dark Shadows' leaves a lot to be desired."
1,moonlight uncomplete,Moonlight - The Complete SeriesI didn't get the No. 1 instead I got two No 2's . I never noticed it till I was done watching them all. So be sure to check when you get them. I'll find anew place to order my movies. I thought I could trust Amazon!
5,Moonlight: The Complete Series,When Moonlight was on TV I would sit there and watch the show even if my mom was talking to me. It has to be one of the best show's ever but the sad part is that CBS cancelled it.I think that they should have at least given it until the end of the first season instead of cancelling it right in the middle of the series.At least we have it on DVD and can watch it over and over again.
4,Campy but good fun,"This show was entertaining. Which is more than I can say for most. I liked the characters and the acting was pretty good, as good as it can be with the scripts and writing. Over all it was a good time. Not gross and dark like most Vampire shows. It is worth the price of the DVD's."
5,Just when it starting getting awesome...,"This series started out slow. It was almost a copy of Angel. After a few episodes though, the story really grabbed me and I really liked the development of the characters. After all, I was a fan of Angel. My wife really like it as well then boom, cancelled. At least Alex is back in Hawaii 5-0 and showes like true Blood and The Vampire Diaries have filled that void. All in all though, I enjoyed this. Enoug that I would grab this on Blu Ray if they released it in that format."
5,Moonlight,I loved this show and was so disapointed when it was cancelled. I was so excited to see this on Amazon so of course I ordered it. Alex O'Loughlin is so sexy and good looking. He could bite me anytime. I would definately recommend this to anyone.
5,Moonlight: The Complete Series,"Moonlight is by far the best show ever. I am disappointed that it was cancelled, but happy that I received my DVD and can watch it whenever I want. I'm still hoping that a movie will be made to give an ending to the story and to answer a lot of questions that were left."
5,Pick it up again people..,O.K. So the writers strike has been over for a while now.. How about this top show is picked up again by the powers to be.. MOONLIGHT was a top series that should have gone on for at least 4 seasons..Give us a break from all the so called reality crap..
5,MOONLIGHT SERIES,"EVERY PERSON WHO GAVE THIS SERIES A 5 STAR RATING IS ON-THE-SPOT CORRECT ABOUT MOONLIGHTS TV SERIES. IF YOU LOVE VAMPIRES, YOU SHOULD LOVE THIS SERIES. WHAT CAN I SAY THAT HASN'T ALREADY BEEN SAID (5 STARS) ABOUT MOONLIGHT? GET IT! YOU WON'T BE DISAPPOINTED. B)"
4,Good Series,It beats the heck out of Hawaii Five-O. This is a series we found by accident and it turned out to be a bit of a hidden jewel. If you like any of the new Vampire movies this will be refreshingly good :)
4,fun and entertaining,"At the time the TV series came out vampires was a new idea, so I thought it entertaining and innovative. They took it off the air too soon. Alex O'loughlen was a plus."
5,"Great show, over too soon","I really enjoyed Moonlight and not just because Jason Dohring was awesome in it as Joseph. The romance between Beth and Mic was very heartfelt and real. Ok the parts about Coraline got old because they went on forever, but the show was otherwise great. I can't believe SyFy didn't pick it up when CBS cancelled it. But then I can't believe CSI obsessed CBS picked up a vampire show to begin with either. Rest assured, this is one cancelled too soon show that did its best wrap things up so you aren't left with a lot of questions or an unhappy ending that they never have the chance to fix. Watching the last minute, I almost have the feeling they shot the unhappy ending, but when they found out the show was axed, when back in and redid it to give the viewers closure."
5,ALEX O' LOUGHLIN..A Star is Born,"What an amazing show and as you can see from all the rave reviews that this was an awesum season, wonder why the show was taken off air in spite of such a huge fan following & even awards?? Hope they re cosider bringing it back soon. It also suprises me that really good and popolar shows like the VAMPIRE DIARIES & MOONLIGHT make the 'Twilight Saga' seem like a B-Grade feature.Meanwhile back on Moonlight, Alex O' Loughlin has an amazing screen presence and sex appeal, you just cannot get your eyes off him. He eats up every frame he is in.. This, another very talented Australian actor is a gift to Hollywood and I can safely place my bet that IF he makes the right choices, we will see him win an Academy award and other awards in the very near fture.As for the Moonlight show, everything from the acting, direction, photography, to the background score are top notch.i already have the DVD and will still buy the Blu Ray whaenever that comes."
3,Disappointed in quality of disc one,"I ordered the Moonlight dvd because I was excited to finally see it available. The first order came promptly and when I attempted to view disc one it would not play. I returned the dvd and requested an exchange. I found the same problem with the exchange. I was disappointed. If you can accept the fact that you can't view episodes 1-4, then purchase it, if not don't. A friend returned this dvd twice and was given a credit on her bank card."
5,Great!,"I received this very timely, in perfect condition. I had been waiting for this series to come out on DVD as I love this show and was very sad (as were a lot of fans!!) when it was cancelled."
5,An amazing TV show,"This series is wonderfully done, with a vulnerable, sexy, dark hero, beautiful heroine, and strongly appealing backstory leading to the romantic tension. The only problem is CBS was just as amazing but in the foolish direction, for ending production just when we fans were completely engaged. Looks like CBS is as lacking in vision and insight as Hollywood is at present."
5,Moonlight Fan,"I loved this series and was very happy to find it on DVD. I have no idea why the series was cancelled afer only 16 shows. The DVD contains all the episodes in a four disk set. I only wish that just like most movies, the DVD set would have included some interviews or other extras besides the series. However, if you loved the series and want to see it all again and again like me, I'd recommed purchasing this DVD set."
5,'Moonlight' Excellent!!,"Wow!!Bought the DVD on a whim and I gotta tell you I am glad I did, it is freaking AWESOME!! I was extremely dissapointed to find only 1 season was made."
5,Love it!,"For a fantasy show it has a very realistic feel. I love that about it. That makes the characters all the more appealing, you can really identify with them. I really love that it's both modern and classy too. And the cast has great chemistry, all of them. I love how slowly the romantic story develops, and the tension between the kind of issues that the characters have to face in the present, and the really unique back story that they have together."
5,Waiting Impatiently....,"I agree with that previous review - CBS is definitely dead to me as well, they tossed one of the most promising series and disregarded the large fan base, all a shame. I do hope to see this come to DVD, the characters worked perfectly together, the locale was great, and the various storylines they could branch out were endless. Truly a sad day if this stays cancelled. Of course it could all be a play on the studio part to see how much people are willing to make a fuss... and if that was the case - I'd be disgusted even more with them. It premiered, it got high marks, its got a solid following and had a perfect time slot - not to mention such a charismatic cast - where in any of that qualifies it for cancellation? RENEW FOR SEASON TWO!"
5,Best show in a long while and they took it off the air...,"This show was the first decent show to come out since Buffy the Vampire Slayer. I still don't understand why it was taken off the air! Between the chemistry of the main actors and the plots and the acting skills in general this was a great show... It was a more mature version of Angel, but it stuck with the vampire theme; not going to every supernatural entity out there so it was more focused as well..."
5,Moonlight DVD set,"Buy this dvd series! You will not be disappointed. I only wish there were more to see! Sophistocated, great music, talented cast - it will steal your heart."
2,"Some good points, but ...","I finally broke down and watched the entire 16 episodes. Mr. O'Loughlin was fine as Mick St. John, but the actress playing his leading lady did not impress me all that much. It had some good production values, but was at times bogged down by mediocre scripting."
2,Worse Vampire/Investigator show Ever!,"Gonna put it plain and simple, you want to see the best Vampire investigative series ever put on tv, Pick-up Blood Ties.Moonlight sucks and never should have been put on tv in this first place, He also sucks in the new Hawaii five-o series.Do yourselvs a favor..........................GET BLOOD TIES!!!"
2,"If Angel or Forever Knight sucked, it would be Moonlight","Moonlight is a collection of everything bad about the vampire film genre. With poorly written uncharismatic characters, like Mick: the man unwillingly turned by his vampire wife, and the suddle-as-a-sunrise romance between the male and female leads. The episode plots are laughable, ranging from a recently turned doctor vampire to a rampaging teen vampire with hormonal issues. There are also half baked love triangles and poor attempts at ""shadow conspirecies"" that make you wonder if the writers where being timed on how fast they could churn out a story as opposed to actually writting something worth watching. Sadly the producers tried to bank on a show who's main draw was a goodlooking male lead. This is almost the same gameplan as trying to sell young males on Halle Berry as Catwoman, and look how that turned out. Note to the potential buyer: There are only 16 episodes for a reason!"
5,Moonlight - Series Ended Way Too Soon!,"Moonlight was one of the great shows that the ""Powers that Be"" didn't give a chance to. It was sexy, fun, interesting and had great characters/actors. Vampires are in! Love the DVD set and am glad to own it, even if the series wasn't resolved. I imagine Beth and Mick living and loving forever, after he turns her!"
5,Really Good Series,I bought Moonlight series after reading all the reviews and I must say I was surprised. The actors are good and make the series. This was a very good series and had potential. I went to try to find season 2 and I was sad to hear it was canceled after 1 season. Hopefully they will bring it back at some point.
3,com-spelling,"A nice blend of sleuth and vampire stories, though nothing really new below the moon; vampires have fangs and are tough cookies when it comes to killing them, love in requited but unrequitable, the hero is of course unhappy about being what he is (but who is happy with their lot?); suprisingly, this is all it takes to do the trick, as when you listen to an old tune played by a new group. Entertaining though not haunting."
3,Moonlight series,"Good TV show and DVD edition. But the spanish language is from latinamerica, not from Spain. Please, specify. I'm from Spain and now I need sell it."
5,Just yummy!,"Even though its been off-air for 2 seasons now, it still is just as enjoyable as it was the first time around. Wish they would bring it back. Now. So much better than most of the drivel on tv. And goodness, CBS was ahead of the current vamp curve! A shame it did not stay there. Wished we'd had 26 episodes of the delicious Mick! It's not too late CBS. We want Mick back!"
5,Vampire Series,"It is a great vampire series! I love it! It is funny and very good. Who likes this kind of series, will love. It will be nice that the new season will be released as soon as possible. But we can wait it."
5,I love Moonlight!,"This, by far, is the best vampire series I have ever seen! I'm so disappointed that the show went off the air but it was awesome to watch! I watched them so much, it's aggravating my family! Alex O'Loughlin is the hottest and most awesome vamp to watch! It's a great series and everyone that loved the series while in was on CBS should buy it!"
5,outstanding captivating show and star,"it was sad and unfair to have this great show cancelled.i would love to help bring it back ,if at all possible.Anyone at there feeling the same way?morgan mama"
5,Absolutely LOVE Moonlight!,"I did not like it when Moonlight was canceled. Why this one had to BITE the dust was beyond me. It was nice to have a fill-in when Angel was taken off the air. This one season show is one of my must-haves for my collection. Can't wait to get it. A two hour movie would be nice...hint, hint."
5,Moonlight dvd,"If you love Vampires you'll love this series. Not as graphic as True Blood but still very enjoyable. Alex O'Laughlin is gorgeous and his counterpart Sophia Myles is great, she looks just like Kate Winslet."
5,The final proof that American public have no taste,"I caught this fantastic show by accident and was totally engrossed by it. It's infuriating to know a show like Moonlight could not find an audience in America, and the 16 episodes are all that are left of the brilliance of the writing, acting, directing.Considering the garbage on TV that does not get canceled, this says a lot about American public's intelligence and taste. I so despise you people now."
5,Most Amazing Show To Get Cancelled,"This show won ""The People's Choice Award"" and as a reward CBS cancels it. Let's hope that it gets released not only in DVD but also on Blu-Ray"
5,Romantic and Very Sexy,The dvd set was great. Hard to stop watching. From the beginning the story line was very interesting and managed to keep my attention until the last show. The dvds were in good condition. Like brand new. Too bad the show got cancelled.
5,An outstanding Series,"This was a wonderful series that ended far to soon, and will unfortunately leave you wanting more for the rest of eternity."
4,Give it some time,"This series got off to a slow start, but give it a few eps and you won't be disappointed. And this is coming from a person who seriously hates vampire stories.Alec O'Loughlin is insanely gifted in the charisma department, and it says a lot for him as an actor that he can deliver craptastic lines like the abovementioned ""Being a vampire sucks,"" and not only get away with it, but make you feel the pain behind it. And Sophia Myles, as the girl you want to hate, has a tough job but she gets it done. I look forward to her next role. (Her resemblance to Kate Winslet is more than a little freaky.)As my review title suggests, this show takes a while to get off the ground. But once it does, it's pretty smooth sailing. It's pretty, it's surprisingly well-acted, and your heartstrings will be tugged upon once or twice (and Jason Dohring has a scene or two that will have you saying, ""Whoa.""). I say kudoes to everyone involved."
4,Gum Shoe Vampire,"This is a fun series that just got better as time went on. Of course, it was cancelled before it could achieve its true potential. What a shame! If you like detective stories and vampires, this one is for you. The plot was solid and interesting. For the most part, the show had a believable feel. The vamp action was not over done. Great entertainment for you and your spouse. My wife and I enjoyed the show together. Romance for her and action for me. Excellent combo!"
2,moonlight,The series is great but the first disk would not play so i sent it back wanting a replacement but i got a refund instead. It was on sale for 17.99 now they have it for 30 something. I would like to just get a replacement for 17.99.thankslarry jones
1,Good show bad disks!,"Don't get me wrong the show is awesome but when I went to watch the show the first disk was playing up, I figured it was just the set I recieved, so I returned it and replaced it. When I went to watch the new set I had bought it had the same problem. Too slack to return it a second time, I will not be buying it again off Amazon, although this is the first item I have had any real problems with."
5,TV's Best Drama,"Intelligent drama with high production values and extraordinary performances. One episode is better than the next, I can't choose a favorite. Unfortunately, there are only sixteen episodes, but I'm ecstatic they have been made available on DVD."
5,Wonderful!!,"I just watched this show for the first time and loved it! I am so disappointed it was only on one season. But then, I had never heard of it before I saw this box set. To bad it didn't continue, I would love to know what happens. Loved this box set and I will watch it over again...so good. Wish it had some special features to go with it though."
5,"Moonlight, the series",Great series and great product! I totally love the series! aAmazon sent the product in a timely fashion and the product was pristine!! I will definately order from Amazon again.
5,If you appreciate good acting,This series lets you see some great acting. It started off with us on Sophia Myles then Alex and after him Jason. We plan to hunt down shows with them in it. It really is too bad there are no more Moonlight shows because it was so different and good.
5,Best Show Ever,"Moonlight is my favorite show of all time and it should have NEVER been cancelled. We were robbed. If you haven't seen it, and you like Twilight...you will love this show."
1,blah,"both the acting and script are mind-numbingly bland in this series, which i think was only greenlit because vamps became so in-style in the past decade. the only bright spot of the show is jason dohring's character, but he doesn't get enough screen time. skip it, and watch joss whedon's 'angel' instead. better yet, watch 'buffy.'"
3,Beware the Cases,"The discs themselves were in great shape, sad I cannot say the same thing for the case. It fell apart as soon as the wrapping was removed. However, I was very grateful to get this series. Thank you."
5,Best show on TV---then it gets cancelled!,"Was set to be a fan of this show for years, only to be disappointed by network tv, yet again. This set will get worn out with replays."
4,A Vampire Movie With a Heart,"TOO BAD MOONLIGHT WAS NOT GIVEN A CHANCE TO STAY LONGER ON AIR. I'VE SEEN A LOT OF VAMPIRE MOVIES AND THIS ONE IS MY CHOICE ..... 10 MILLION MOONLIGHT FANS CAN NOT BE WRONG, THIS IS AN EXCELLENT MOVIE. THE CHARACTERS MICK ST JOHN, BETH TURNER, JOSEF, AND THE REST WERE PORTRAYED SO WELL."
4,Moonlight Series review,"While not a vampire fan, I am an Alex O'Loughlin fan and really enjoyed the whole series.What I didn't like were no extras - no deleted scenes, bloopers, or even director/star comments."
5,wonderful and honest seller and totally great dvd,this was a great item which my hubby loves. this seller was honest easiest to work in great shape and the best thing was that the dvds were sent on time and and i received it in time for his birthday. thank you so much
5,Moonlight - The Complete Series,Loved this series. So surprised with all the hype of Twilight that the network cancelled the series. So glad that they came out with it on DVD so I can enjoy once again.
4,Excellent Series!,"Very good series, including mystery, murder, suspense, romance and of course VAMPIRES. Too bad it wasn't longer..."
4,Vampire hottness,The sexual attraction in this show alone will capture you. I thought the excitement of this show was non stop action with each episode. If you like vampires and excitement this is for you. Mick St John is one hot vampire! Cancelling this show was just wrong!
5,Great show Loved Loved Loved it!,"I Loved this show and hated it when it didn't air on television anymore!!! Now I will NOT get into anymore TV shows because once you like a show as good as "" Moonlight"" they take it off air...I recommend this to anyone that likes a really good Love story..."
1,Probably not what you expect,"This is a 5-pin socket, but there are only 4 connectors & 3 leads. Relay pins 30 & 85 are tied together with a short jumper, and the remaining leads are for 86 and 87a. So, the way it works (e.g.) is that when 30 is hooked to your 12V DC, the jumper applies the trigger voltage to 85. If 86 is grounded, then you get *nothing* out of the 87a (NC) lead. You make this ""work"" by switching *open* the (86) lead to ground, allowing juice to flow out 87a. Why they don't just provide 5 connectors and 5 leads, especially including 87 (NO), I don't know. Save yourself a headache, and find a *relay* with the diode built in, and get a plain socket with 5 connectors & leads."
2,"It's not bad, just cheap.","As KEITH said, if you need five connectors then you will need a sacrificial socket as new bare quick connect female connectors with the lock-in tab (removable with a pin or brad) are hard to find. The shunted connector can be moved to another terminal or clipped and spliced, a trivial task. Wires appear to be only 18 gauge; for sturdier wiring consider the double sockets with longer 16 gauge wires. These have external diodes. Sockets can be ganged together. Definitely a cheap socket."
1,Badly Designed keychain,"The hooks are of real poor design. They open real easily and the keys pop out. If they replaced the hooks with small rings, it would be more secure. Don't waste your money on this product."
1,Save your Money,"1. I agree with Alolph although I don't like this key case as much. The keys go on a nice spring loaded ring but this is attached to the key case with a poorly designed hook. The hook opens and the key and ring fall off. I lost one this way. Others have come loose in my hand. I have bent the hooks to keep them on for a while but I plan to switch to a better system and throw this one away.2. Also be aware that you may not be able to get your car key attached due to the design of the spring ring. My car key is partially plastic (for the remote key less entry.3. Although the unit measures 2 3/4 inches by 4, any key longer than about 2.75 inches will protrude. This would have been a problem for my car key if I had been able to attach it."
3,"Nice leather, but faulty key hooks","I have used several key cases like this one in order to avoid holes in my pants pockets. This one has very nice soft leather construction, but the key rings are terrible. They do not work well with car keys because they cannot accept the larger key in use by most manufactures today. When I tried to adjust the hook it broke off. It is made of thin soft metal that cannot be altered at all. I, too, have had problems with keys falling off the hooks. Not funny when your key falls into the trunk just as you are closing it."
1,Awful product,It's hard to imagine they can make key rings like this. Isn't the idea of a key wallet to keep your keys in one place? I had to add other rings just to hold these keys in place. I got a $5 key ring in Chinatown NYC it lasted a year. This lasted a week at best.
2,Had one of those.,"I had one of those and as people said, the individual key items come loose very easily. Not secure.Also, it doesn't really hold car keys without bending the cards you can put into the side pocket too much. Even with just flat keys it can't hold nearly as many as it has hooks.I still have it 2 stars since I actually used it for a while. If you are aware of the unsafe mount you can adjust it with pliers every now and then."
5,This is a love story-with a very difficult ending.,"For those of us who have loved ones afflicted with Alzheimer's disease this is a story that can help us sort out our feelings of love, mixed with periods of anger and those of dispair. John Bayley was truly couragous through the final disease that took his brillant wife, Dame Iris Murdoch. It is is celebration of life and an understanding of the disease that takes a mind long before the body leaves this earth."
4,A warm glimpse into Iris the person...,"This is a warm, gentle, sweet-hearted devotional to the great writer by her husband, who clearly was (is) genuinely in love with this wife of 40 years. Bayley's writing is literate and engaging, and it well conveys the spirit of both Murdoch's writing and her imagination. It is interesting to get a sense of Iris the person (apparently as original and oddly ungraspable as the characters and narratives of her novels), and it would have been nice to get more information about her along these lines. The marriage depicted has a flavor that is tweedy, intellectual, quaintly innocent, and gently eccentric in a veddy British way. The only weaknesses for me were the author's occasional extended digressions about his own views on literature, and the resulting sense of wanting a more intensive and penetrating focus on Iris Murdoch herself. Overall, the book is a cozy, enjoyable, undemanding little read that really engages your heart and your imagination."
3,A touch of ego,"As I read this book about a most prolific author, I was distressed to keep on reading about John Bayley's name dropping.His drifted in so many directions and seemed to continually get off the subject of Iris. I wanted to know more about her daily life and more of her thinking. Although the book did move me,I did not feel it was enough considering the subject matter.However,it has made me want to read some of the novels that Iris wrote. Which I will do."
1,"""Elegy for Reader"" is a more accurate title.","Though well written and fabulously voiced with vivid literary allusions, this book fails to be moving, or even meet its perceived goals and objectives. It is not an elegy for Iris, as the title implies, but a long, drawn out lamentation for poor author John Bayley. The book does a good job of making a chronicle of Bayley's and Murdoch's life together, but does not immortalize or draw sympathy for Iris. Bayley sadly neglects his wife's battle's with Alzheimer's Disease, lacking creativity and imagination in describing her endeavors and battle with the illness, and instead focuses on how great their past was. I am oh so impressed with Bayley's education and Iris's genius, but felt the book was condescending to the reader, unfocused, and a disgrace to the struggles of Iris and John under the harsh consequences of a deadly disease."
5,Wonderful!,"I listen to Engelberts music everyday. His voice is a real gift from above, and he sure makes the most of every sound that comes from his mouth, with the range his voice has. No one does it better/"
5,Poco's crowning moment,Legend is perhaps the greatest album Poco has ever done after being over looked for nine years trying to carve a nitche into being a pop act taken seriously. This album from 78 really was the high point in the groups see-saw career.Although i was only kid back in 78 it certainly got a lot airplay which finally broke them into the mainstream which they been struggling to get to for so long. Over the last five years Poco were going in a more pop oriented direction they felt would be a big step for them to finally get over the hump which at long last it did pay off when they scored Legend which featured Crazy love which to date is Poco's biggest seller. This is the kind of album you would travel home after a gig or partying with friends especially on a late rainy night to relax and enjoy some soft rock to soothe you.
5,This is not Eagles!,"This is the first Poco album I have heard all the way through. I read other reviews comparing this band to Eagles so I went out and bought Legend. I was sadly disappointed. I don't see any more reason to compare Poco to Eagles than to any other band. I saw similarities to several other bands. If you want Eagles, buy Eagles. If you want good soft rock than can stand on its own merits, then this might be the CD for you. The late seventies was a weak time for music what with disco invading the scene, Lynyrd Skynyrd's plane crash, Joe Walsh joining Eagles, Van Halen, and other disasters. This is some of the better stuff that happened in that time. It is easy to listen to and in spite of what others may say there is real talent here. I didn't like it much at first, but when I realized that it was not really like Eagles I listened to it on its own merit. I think I'll check out more Poco."
2,Maybe I am missing something?,"This works well IF I leave the drippings in the cup long enough for the fat to solidify on the top (and then pour the still liquid part out), but I can't figure out how it is supposed to work otherwise....oh well, it is a nice, pourable measuring cup anyway!"
4,Works great,Love the large size. Perfect for pouring all of the cooking juice in to and waiting for it to separate. Came in very handy on Thanksgiving.
3,Not useful for a small amount of liquied,I haven't used this for a large amount of liquid but i did not work effectively with a small amount approximately 1/2 cup
4,Does the trick; wish it was sturdier in the handle,"This is a nice piece of equipment overall. The top is a handy strainer that gets out the chunks. The rubber plug keeps the fat from creeping up into the spout. It's made of tough, clear plastic that should be pretty durable. Only gripe is that the connection to the handle is made of the softer gray plastic, and there's a little bit of flex in there that makes me wonder."
5,Great Gravy/Fat Separator!,"I don't know why I didn't buy one of these much sooner, but now that I have this one, I just love it! It is very well made and works perfectly. The padded handle keeps it from getting too hot to hold, and the four cup Oxo separator is just the right size."
5,Good product,"I have never had/used a fat separator before and bought this to cook Thanksgiving dinner.This is a four cup capacity, which is fantastic. The cover stops chunks of stuff from getting into the broth but doesn't inhibit the flow into the cup. The markings on the outside make it very clear exactly how much liquid you have, which is essential for recipes.I'm not 100% sure how it works but with the stopper in the spout, the saturated fat floats to the top. In seconds the fat is separated, you pop the stopper out and pour. I used it once so far with only 1/2 cup of drippings and this worked beautifully. I'm looking forward to using it on Thanksgiving with even more liquid.The one and only thing that I am not really fond of is the spout is difficult to clean. A bottle brush can be forced into the hole. The packaging did not say if the cup and pieces were or were not dishwasher safe, so I washed it by hand to be sure."
4,Nice Separator,"I have not used this very often, but when I have I've been pleased. The stopper for the spout, which confounded me, proved to be excellent at keep fat out of it. So, there was never that little splash of grease right as one pours out the juices. It's capacious, and the strainer works for larger bits. If one needs a fine sauce, a finer strainer will need to be used."
5,Love this,"I made beef stock and was able to drain through top and tilt/pour fat-free broth into my sauce. When I got to the bottom, I plugged the spout and tilted to pour most of remaining fat off through large top opening. Meanwhile, the broth in spout stayed where it was.It also worked the same way for separating sausage fat and au jus. I loved being able to save the tasty liquid without having to throw it out with the fat."
3,NOT dshwasher safe!,"I cook a lot and I LOVE OXO products. The 4 cup separator was no exception the first time I used it. Like all of the other OXO products in my kitchen, it went in to the dishwasher and came out looking great... the first time.Trouble came shortly after that first use. The second time I used it, it went into the dishwasher (top shelf) and the gray insert on top came out melted! I called OXO and they were really great about it!I did everything correctly: this product MUST be cleaned on the top shelf of the dishwasher. It also should never be used with a sterilize setting in the dishwasher.OXO is sending me a new one (I am VERY appreciative of that! Thank you OXO for standing behind your products).Buy it, use it.. but I'd really recommend that you hand wash it."
4,Works Wonderful,"Pros: holds quite a bit of liquid. Easy to clean And works just like it says it does.Cons: holes are to big in the lid and you may want to use a strainer if you don't want any solids getting through.Yes I would reccomend buying this. I had went through some generic ones in the past and eventhough this is a bit pricey, it is built to last."
5,4-cup fat separator,I have wanted one of these for a long time. It seems to have all the features I wanted. Cannot wait until Thanksgiving and really put it to use!
5,Great product,Have always had a fat separator for the holidays. They always seem to crack shortly after using the product. Have used this one several times and it is still crack free! Love the top which pulls out some of the meaty chunks.
3,"like the thickness, the plug, but spout should come from the VERY bottom","This would be super product if the spout hole was at the absolute bottem of pitcher. If I had ordered the smaller one, perhaps it would be less of an issue, but the hole is pretty big and from one half inch (low edge) to one inch (high edge) from bottem of pitcher. When I have lots of broth its fine and I throw out the last quarter cup or more with the grease."
5,Great size!!,This is one of the only ones I found with this larger capacity. OXO never disappoints. I could never get by with a one cup capacity.
4,If you lose the rubber stopper thingy ---,"If you loose the rubber stopper, without which the separator won't work, don't despair. A wine cork is a great substitute."
5,"I had my doubts, but now I'm a believer!","I was a bit skeptical about whether or not this separator would actually work. I'm happy to say it does a fantastic job and I'm so glad I bought it. My last separator did not have a plunger and I had to wait quite a while for the fat to rise, then pour very carefully to keep the fat from coming out. What a pain. The design of the OXO separator is so simple, but works immediately and so well. As at least one other reviewer already mentioned, be sure to have the plunger in place before adding your liquid.While I don't consider this a design flaw at all, I do find the holes in the strainer/lid to be a bit larger than I would like for some applications. When necessary, I just add a few layers of fine cheesecloth over the strainer/lid. Problem solved."
5,Oxo Good Grips Fat Separator - 4 Cup,"I bought this before Thanksgiving (I am the gravy man in our family). I have owned and used similar products, but this separator is head and shoulders the best. Size, shape, cup/ml markings, and strainer are all excellent, and the spout plug which keeps the fat out of the spout while the rises to the top is superb."
5,works perfectly!,"i was a little unsure about how this would work, but now i have seen the light! i make homemade chicken stock about once a week and this perfectly seperates the fat from the stock. no more skimming the pot! i could not be more pleased."
4,Works as expected,"This item worked as expected. It did a fine job of separating broth from fat, and it is dishwasher safe."
4,Finally,"I searched the local stores for this Separator. Finally I went to Amazon and received it within days of ordering, just in time for Thanksgiving. This is great for getting the grease off home made soups, stews or gravys. I don't have a reason for using it everyday, but it does the job when needed, and aids in healther eating."
5,Terrific,I just used this for my Christmas turkey and it worked perfectly. It led me to the best gravy I've ever made.
5,Hubs was so excited,"Hubs was so excited I purchased this, we make a lot of bone broth or chicken stock and it is annoying to skim the fat"
5,Necessary item for every cook,Absolutely necessary to defat meat juices in order to make gravies and sauces. Love it; had looked for this item in many stores and finally found it at Amazon.
5,simply the best book on the subject,"This is it, the best book ever written on writing feature articles for newspapers and magazines. I've been writing, editing, and of course reading features for nearly 20 years, and have read many, many books on the subject. This is the one I press on colleagues, friends, even strangers on the street. It works because the damned thing is written by a guy who's done the work at a big-name daily (the Wall St. Journal), not an academic or writer manque. The book smells of the newsroom. It's real. Get it"
5,Excellent book for journalists,"This book shows the nuts and bolts about good journalism: writing and interviewing techniques, how to get good story ideas, etc. It has a great deal of examples too. Every journalist should read it at least once. The best thing would be to revisit it every two or three years."
5,Absolutely the best book about writing and reporting I've evern stumbled on,"This book is like nothing I've ever come across in terms of nailing what good reporting and writing is--and communicating the craft in clear-minded, actionable and practical yet artful terms.I had the pleasure of speaking to Blundell himself and he is exactly what the book would suggest: A super writer, reporter and teacher of reporting."
2,A bit boring?,"Enthousiastic customer reviews made my choice of this book a no-brainer. Working for a major international news agency as a financial correspondent, I looked for some fresh methods, angles and ideas to incorporate in my interviews and market wrap-ups from the equity and corporate world. But reading through this (highly-praised) feature-writing guide I was disappointed to see that the material is very boring, outdated and repetitive of the examples used. The book may give some guidance for one-story-a-month, relaxed writers. But it looks out of touch with the modern world of editors demanding fairly speedy 'spot coverage' of events, where the newsbreaks and the accompanying stories are written on laptop computers and sent by e-mail."
3,Good for reference.,"The Art and Craft of Feature Writing was, after all, written over ten years ago. This author gives the blunt impression that both writers and readers are only men. This is ok, however outdated since authors today typically write to both sexes or minimally give examples of women as well as men writers. The reading can be laborious but my two favorite chapters are Shaping Ideas and Notes on Self Editing and Style. I'll keep the book for reference."
5,A Tale Well-told!,"I thoroughly enjoyed this particular novel very much. It deals with three sects of the Assamite clan who call themselves Children of Haqim. I was amazed at how he put one of each of the sects together. I have always thought that the children of Haqim were more than the stereotypical assassin. Initially there is some conflict between their different points of view. How Stefan works it out is simply amazing. He even introduces a character with True Faith and how it affects the kindred around him. I liked how Sir Hugh, a kindred himself has a very strong sense of faith. All in all I will have to say that Stefan Petrucha is a master storyteller!"
2,extreme contemporary,"The publishers did a fine job on the quality of this book. Although 10x10 was not at all what I was looking for others may find it useful. I found that it had extremely contemporary design throughout, current and old. Its focus was more on the very soul and defenition of contemporary that is shown in form. I am not a designer or architecht, but am sure that type of person would get more from the book than I did. Basically I was looking for a collection of ideas that could some how be implemented into other forms, but I was not successful. All I could see was page after page of a revolving theme that I now know does not appeal to me in its purest form.."
5,Just what I wanted!,"Great simple watch - one dial and one knob. Perfect for working outside. Easy to read dial, thin and light weight. Seems to be keeping perfect time to boot! Great price. Perfect."
4,Cheap and Good,"This watch is worth for the money. But I should use it carefully as it has got plastic case instead of a glass. Also, as the dial is small, I am going to give it to my wife. For men this is very small..On the whole.. worth for the money..."
1,Fatally itchy band,"As a timekeeping device, I have no issues with this watch, but for something a human being is supposed to affix to their body, I have a problem. I haven't figured out why yet, but the band is so intolerably itchy, I literally can't wear the watch. It's definitely in the clasp area, but I can't find any burrs or flash on it that might rub. I'm not particularly sensitive to rubber, et c., so I'm guessing it's catching and pulling out minute hairs. As a new band would cost at least as much as the watch, it's essentially a write-off. Crumbs."
4,watch,"the watches were just as described, they are for gifts so I have not used or wore any of them,"
1,Horrible,Very Cheap. Shipping was almost same as product. Looks like an item you can purchase at any dollar store!
2,Didn't last long,"I bought this watch in October 2008 and it died less that a year later. All I wanted was to check the time, but I don't need a watch that dies unexpectedly."
4,Functional watch,"I bought this watch a few weeks ago. It is a very simple and fuctional watch. If you are looking for something more stylish, this is not the best option for you. But if you are looking for a trustable and simple watch, then it is a great option, specially for the price."
3,"This watch is worth its price, but not so good as expected","Anyway, its a nice watch that you can get at a price under $10. Simple and good to use, but not as good as I expected.The band is plastic, which made me feel less texture than my last watch the band of which is metal. The whole weight isa little light, so when you wear it you feel a sense of ungrounded.In a nutshell this is a low-class watch, I just wear it two times and don't want to take it again."
5,urban hip - sophisticated - simple,"WANT TO KNOW WHAT TIME IT IS AT A GLANCEIf you're drawn to the simplicity of this watch you've got it right! Big gaudy nonsense styled silver watches are not for me but this little fella is, I promise it won't leave your side. As others have said it goes with anything, doesn't tell time in the dark (only negative) but tells very accurate time, lasts forever, and cuts a very sleek profile. I have no qualms, much prefer it over Timex Camper which has a similar simple aesthetic. This watch is great and addictive, very good use of ~10 bucks.I really love the watch!"
4,"Great watch, with just 1 flaw","This watch is very light weight and sleek looking. It's real easy to tell the time, even at night/in dim light. The only one complaint I have is that the hard plastic buckle scratches my wrist: I filed it down a little bit and its ok now."
3,Very small,This watch looks O.K. but is very small . This is not men's watch. I give it to my daughter.
5,see other review lol,"Great Watch Great price Keeps excellent time. a good work watch, would recommend it thinking of getting another one soon"
1,Died in 32 days,"I received this watch in August 25, and it was dead today (32 days!), and I shortly found that the return window was closed right before today. How unlucky I am!"
2,It's Not what is shown.,"The watch you will receive is either not what is shown or they gave me the wrong watch. In the middle of the time display is a silver disk like circle that shines the sun light right in your eyes making the hands near impossible to read. It actually hurts. Plus, the cardboard box it comes in doesn't tell you what ""Rank"" your watch is so you do not know how much, if at all, it's water resistance actually is. Plus, the band, though soft, really makes your wrist sweat. NOT what is advertised. Please pay attention to the fact that companies put in false positives to make you think more people like the product on amazon. Pay attention to the detail given in comments Not how many comments there are in a given area.Thank you."
1,"Tiny, Tiny Watch","This watch is so small! Also, I tried to buy a larger watch band from a local store that fits ""all Casio watches"" and it would not even fit. Would not recommend this AT ALL!"
3,Casio Mens Watch,"Lets face it, if your buying this watch, your not expecting alot. I am completely pleased with accuracy, but this one's a bit small and cheesy looking for man's watch."
3,Tells Time !!!,"It is a watch, it's a watch - but feels like a toy watch. However it tells time correctly."
4,"very nice watch, light and comfortable","Buy the watch to work for the light it is and it does not bother me to work, when my friends saw me asked me to watch immediately order one.is very comfortable, I recommend"
1,Needs Warning!,"Wanted simple watch that i could set, put on, & look to see what time it is. This was *almost* that perfect watch. ALMOST!Apparently, one must UNSCREW THE CROWN in order to set the time, and so far this has been impossible. A tiny crown unfit for human fingers. (Can someone suggest a *tool* that might work?) There should be an Amazon caveat in the description of this Casio. I fear disabling the setting stem entirely, so I have given up, put it on, and now must SUBTRACT two hours to determine the time. Later, i'll have to subtract only *one* hour. Golly! Even for twelve bux, one should get more than this. I'll have to find another, thus this was money wasted. One star hardly expresses my disappointment.Note: *I* am content witht the size but larger men might not be."
3,It's nice watch for the money but...,"Casio makes great, inexpensive watches but I found this watch to be small and it did not illuminate. It was more of a woman's watch than a man's unless the man has a small wrist. It runs fine and keeps good time. For the money, it;s a good watch."
4,Great Watch for the price but battery suspect,"You never have to worry about breaking this watch. It's as tough as any other watch I've owned but if the crystal breaks, just buy another one. Looks OK and the rubber watchband is comfortable.I have bought two of these watches. The battery died on the first after 7-8 months and I damaged the plastic case opening the back. The battery on the second died after 3 months but the web does have instructions on how to replace it. Easy if you own a jeweler's screwdriver; just remember to remove the watchband first."
4,Beautifully Plain-Vanilla Design,Most watch designs are over-kill with gadgetry and extraneous design elements. Not this one--it's clean and to my taste. One problem is that the clasp somewhat itches the underside of my wrist--but not so much that I don't wear it or anything.
4,Style for next to nothing? Disposable watch for hiking or traveling? Just a cheap watch? All the above.,There is not much to this gloriously inexpensive item. It's stark minimalism is probably what would qualify it as a fashion statement. Just a simple white face with black numerals in a relatively attractive (not comic sans) typeface. Watch strap is rubber...buying the whole watch is cheaper than buying a new strap in most cases. I gave it 4 stars because it isn't anything to rave about...just a watch.
5,"good, simple quality","Yes, it is a simple watch. It costs twice as much at target. I have been very pleased, I just wanted something basic that won't get dirty and cleans easily. As a student nurse it is also good for that reason, and it is very visible in a dimmed room for taking vital signs. Has no backlight, but is perfect for my needs"
3,casio watch review,This is a nice watch if you are a woman or small man or child. This watch is quite small (as was reported in previous reviews). Someone said it looked dainty on my wrist... I havent worn it since. It's now sitting on my wife's dresser not being worn.
1,dont buy!,"this watch stopped working within a few weeks of me buying it! It could just be the battery, but a new battery would cost more than the watch itself. the watch looks decent, but face scratches very easily"
5,good for women as well =),"cheap, stylish, waterproofI have used the watch for a year since I bought it, and had not a single problem.the band is flexible and nice, and contact with water never caused any damage"
2,I'm not a whiner,"But this card sure is!! The fan noise was more irritating than fingernails on a chalkboard. I can could hear it two rooms away. Maybe mine was just defective. I don't know. But I returned it and got the GeForce 7100 instead. No FAN!!I'm not a gamer - I'm a developer who needed 2 monitors. The quality of Visa Aero interface is just as good on both cards. DVD playback is the same too.BTW, I've learned the hard way - If you have a Dell Dimension and install this card, your old video port goes dead. I was spoiled with 3 monitors with my old PC. Two steps forward, one step back.OK, No more whining."
2,You get what you pay for,"I only have a 300 watt power supply, so I'm limited as to which cards I can use in my PC. I bought this to replace an ATI X700 that was failing after 17 months. I didn't want to spend much because I plan on replacing my computer next year. Bad decision. Truely, the integrated graphics that came with my computer displays much better text and pictures and has more resolution options than this card, although the card does enable some additional video functions. The X700 was much much better, and I wish I'd bought another one."
4,Geforce 7300GS,"I tryed it with few games . The card works properly but i didnt try yet that card with some game that need more resorses. Ligth installetion, now it used with NVIDEA DETONATOR. until now all is good."
5,Vista-ready Video Card,"Looking for something between a full blown gaming card, and a business focused video card I decided on this card. Was I wrong! This card provides more than enough punch for some deep graphics when playing in Vista.The driver worked the first time, and I can view the new Aero effect in Vista without any issues."
2,Annoying Fan,"This product works just fine but the fan is annoyingly loud. It doesn't have any sort of setting to change the level the fan runs, so no matter what kind of program your running, or how hot the GPU is, the fan runs at the highest level. The only way to turn it off is to unplug the fan from the GPU card. I have been having to open up my computer and plug the fan in every time I run a demanding game and my GPU heats up, and having to open up yet again and unplug it when I am using any less demanding program (surfing the internet, IM, etc.)"
4,Good enough for me,It provided a modest bump in my video performance without a big price. I haven't had any problems in the 2 weeks I've had it.
1,"FAN is SO noisy, and they want $30+shipping to replace it!","It's simple. The fan is loud. It gets louder. I call. They say, ""Sure we'll replace it for a $30 fee (oh, and you have to front the cost of another card since we don't trust you to mail the old one back on your own dime)."" Thanks guys. I'll remember to tell my friends about you."
1,LOUD Fan - horrible customer service,The fan on this card was exceptionally loud from the start and only got louder. When I called to have it replaced they would NOT replace the card without me paying a $30 processing fee. Bad card + bad service = don't by PNY.
4,Fellow New Brunswicker loved this book!,"Kate's feelings, her view of nature and the world around her were very real to me.I felt her loss, her frustations and finally her coming to terms with the hand that she had been dealt.Looking forward to another great novel by this author."
2,Painfully slow,"I wish I could say I liked this book. But, it's slow, arduous and painful depictions were as agonizing to me as Tom's death. The only saving grace was the actual hatbox letters."
1,Sucks!!!,The book has hair ideas that only a child would wear from age 5-8yrs. All the hairstyles are hair that sticks straight up or is unnatural looking. I HATE THIS BOOK
3,Liked it a lot better before I found out it was fake...,"I actually liked this book a lot and had no reason to think it was fake until I watched an interview with Vandenberg himself. In the interview Vandenberg clearly states that the book was BASED ON his life, and that parts of the book were definitely tweaked to make the story more interesting. So there you have it. Who knows how much of the book is true and how much is fabricated?"
3,The Iron Circle; The True life Story of Domoniquie Vandenberg,"I did find this book amusing and entertaining. But I cannot find anything about ""kunto karate"" either. I also found offensive and unbelievable how he commented how the 2nd Parachute Reg ran circles around a Navy Seal team in a training exercise. I find that hard to believe. Also his comment about Seal team 6 being helpless in the jungle even though they tough I also found unbelieveable and angered me. Read more like a really enjoyable fiction to me."
3,More Barf-o than Budo! Over the Top!,"Ok,Ok yeah, he's a bad a---. So what? What is the point of all this? You got me. The guy is either SuperMan or is adept at fiction. You be the judge."
1,Fiction,"If half of this were true, and without the 3rd grade level writing, this might make a good story. Really, this is such a pathetic attempt on the part of Mr. Vandenberg to inflate his own ego and create a myth of himself and why, why didn't he get someone who could write? He sounds like he is desperate and needs years of therapy. Pick up any comic book and you will do better."
2,"Interesting story, but awful writing.","Wow, if this story is true, it is truly remarkable. Dominiquie would be a real life action hero/adventurer. My problem with this book is the quality of the writing. The writing is atrocious. If Dominiquie knew anything about the craft of writing, he would find the author and beat the living tar out of him, because that is what he deserves after such a lackluster effort with the pen. Seriously, i had to laugh sometimes at how cliche some of this stuff was. I think a monkey could have written a better book. So read on at your own risk."
4,Now she's having fun with us!,"This time there's a lot going on with Agatha Raisin. We learn more about Agatha's background and childhood, her marriage, and her motivation. We also learn more about James. This makes us more sympathetic to Agatha, but do we like James more, or even as much as we did? The mystery's solution was not obvious to me, so it was quite fun. The language and situations are getting raunchier -- more fun there, too! Definitely some surprising moments. Like a British cozy dipped in gin and sprinkled with a dose of ""EastEnders."" This series just gets better."
3,"Oh, Agatha","Just as Agatha and James are about to say their I Do's in wanders the allusive Jimmy Raisin. Yes, that Jimmy Raisin, Agatha's first husband whom she had thought was long dead.So with the wedding off and Agatha spitting nails, Jimmy is found dead in a ditch and since it appears no one else knew Jimmy, it had to be Agatha who killed him. But wait, not so fast , there are others in this tiny village that have secrets and Jimmy being there just might throw a wrench into their plans.This is a very good series, humorous and with an interesting cast of characters that follow Agatha from book to book."
5,"""AGATHA IS GREAT""","Another good one by M C Beaton. I have enjoyed all the Agatha Raisin books I have read. In this one Agatha is finally getting to marry James Lacey. But, her first husband Jimmy Raisin shows up at the wedding. Agatha thought he was dead. Later Agatha pushes Jimmy into a ditch and he is found dead in the ditch. Agatha is suspected of murder. She and James Lacey start their usual round of questions and callin on people to try to find the killer. Other people start ending up dead after talking to Agatha and James. After another close call the killer is found. Will Agatha and James ever get together again. I guess we will have to read another book to find out. Beaton can write so that the people and the village come to life in your mind. You can just see the things as they happen. Am looking forward to the next one."
5,"Agatha Raisin, Always Great",I really love this series. The main character is funny and the plots are excellent. Always a great read! I want more!
5,Agatha is at it again.,Agatha Raisin is one of the most interesting fictional characters I have ever discovered. I'm never disappointed by one of MC Beaton's Agatha books. I bought this one for my sister to introduce her to the series. Can't wait to see if she loves Agatha as much as I do.
3,Agatha's Murderous Marriage,A quick read of a few hours. As usual MC Beaton entertains withAgatha finally getting James to the court house for marriageSurprises ensue...enjoy
3,Nothing special,"I purchased this to replace a Panasonic DVD player and found an incredible differance. The remote control in laid out without any thought or reason for DVD playing. Fumbling and staring for the correct button is always necessary. Slow motion playback of DVD's is terrible. I am using the HDMI output, but the video quality is not as good as the Panasonic standard video output. Overall I can see Sony put no effort into the manufacturing of this product."
2,great image when works,"great product, I've always been a Sony fan but this product let me down, after 90 days the combo does not play dvd's, it just make weird noises and nothing happens, maybe I got the lemon, haven't talk to Sony yet but I know I'm gonna have to break my piggy bank.."
5,the finast book on money and prosperity ever written !,THIS BOOK TRULY GETS TO THE BOTTOM LINE ON HOW TO BE PROSPEROUS IN LIFE. AFTER READING THIS BOOK ITS EASY TO SEE WHY YOU ARE WHERE YOU ARE CONCERING FINANCES IN YOUR LIFE.IT EXAMINS YOUR EMOTIONS ABOUT MONEYAND THATS THE CORE OF WHAT IT'S ABOUT.
1,"If you want to prosper, then get Dynamic Laws of Prosperity",I found this book a waste of time. You should tell your customers to spend their money on the better prosperity books by Catherine Ponder. You list almost all of her books on your amazon.com site. The best is the Dynamic Laws of Prosperity.
1,Heroine is too prejudiced!!!,"Heroine constantly tells the hero that she hates him because he is a gypsy. Good Lord what is wrong with this woman!! The gypsy dude is so hot!! but she constantly refuses him for no other reason than for him being a filthy gyspy (yes she really said that) Fought constatly with the hero which is why I traded this book off not worth the money i paid for it I bought it hoping that it would be as good as The Pirate Prince but sadly no. Just too much arguing and bitching and why oh why do authors think they have to have that in a book for it to sell? Don't know cause after that I refuse to buy her other books and the latest one out well just the summary on the back of the book made me steer clear. One star for again that hot guy on cover but do not buy this book because of that, you have been warned!"
2,Crappy Heroine,"Gypsy Lover has a romantic sexy hero. Unfortunately, the heroine is predjudiced against gypsies - even after the hero has rocked her world three times! Until almost the last 1/3 of the book, she thinks that Dante is beneath her and can't marry him. But that doesn't stop her from getting it on with him. The sex scenes were pretty hot, too bad it wasn't with another female. I would not bother to buy this book - check it out at the library. A better book from Connie Mason is the Rogue and the Hellion."
4,But I'm not sure I could have done better,"Only two deficiencies I can see. (1) The militia is continually confused with the National Guard - a federal organization that didn't exist until one and a quarter centuries after the Constitution was written. (2) Ms Travis apparently can't distinguish between a restrictive clause and an independent phrase. Considering her task, though, I'm willing to cut her some slack: I'm selling my copy to a mother of two school-age daughters, rather than trashing it."
2,Commentary detracts,"I purchased this book hoping for a good introduction to the Constitution. What I received was very commentary-heavy, not direct paraphrasing book with a less than pleasant layout. Not what I was looking for at all for my kids. IMO, the description of the book did not accurately describe the book."
5,Now I get it,"We studied Constitution in boy scouts. I didn't get it, though, especelly the amendment stuff. this book make it easy to get, all of it."
5,A Primer On The Ice Ages,"When I first saw and bought Ice Age by John and Mary Gribbin, I thought that I'd give it to the school library straight away - it looked like a good little book that a high school student would be able to handle. Yesterday, I needed a short book to read, so I pulled it off the shelf. Ice Age is a very pleasant surprise. John and Mary Gribbin, a powerhouse science writing duo, have given us a nice, little essay on how we discovered the ice ages in the first place and how we discovered the main cause of those ice ages. This would be a great little book for someone to read before they took on one of the more difficult tomes on ice ages or climate change. I recommend this book to any one looking for a brief background on the history of the science surrounding the ice ages."
2,Small Book about science history,"This is very small book - this fact is easy to miss on Amazon.It is not popular science - this is only about how Ice Age theary was discovered with big portion of scientist's biographies - but practically no factual information at all.I expected book about Ice Ages - not how they were discovered, so I was dissapointed."
2,"Hard to read, lacks examples","This book supplies a lot of essential equations for geophysics but is terribly boring. The problems at the end of the chapter have few examples to offer any help with the problems. This book is overly concerned with derivation and not concerned enough with clear, easy to follow explanations."
3,Wouldn't stay attached to a painted wood wall,"I used these to hold necklaces (one necklace each) and they all fell within 24 hours. I cleaned the wall again and used new strips and tried again - they fell again.*edit 6/8/12 - bumped up to 3 stars from 1.Since my original review, I've had luck with these on regular walls, but they will not stay attached to a painted wood wall, even if you've followed instructions. Packaging and description should reflect that."
3,Meh,"These hooks didn't work for my Halloween decorations. They fell off the walls. I will try again with my Christmas ones, but will use many hooks at a time for extra reinforcement. Wish me luck!"
2,Terrible!,"I bought these clips to put Christmas lights in my windows. After following the directions...cleaning the window thoroughly with alcohol, pressing on for 30 seconds and waiting 1 hour before putting on the lights...the lights stayed up for about 24 hours before the clips started falling off one by one. The lights were small and were not too heavy for the hooks to support and it was not so cold outside that my windows were freezing. The only reason why I am giving two stars instead of one is because the few clips that did remain on the window were removed easily and left nothing behind. Nice idea, nice price, may be of use in other ways, but I do NOT recommend them for hanging Christmas lights."
2,size,"couldn't really tell the size that well, except to see they were on the smaller size. When i tried to use them to hang Xmas lites all that fit was a single thin wire that had to be forced behind the clip."
1,Not as pictured!!,"This product was not as pictured. Received 1st order and it was ""white"" clips not ""clear"" clips as shown. I re-ordered over the phone explaining the problem. Second order arrived and was also ""white."" Returned both orders for refund. So don't order this item if you're looking for ""clear"" clips."
1,Dont buy this,I followed all of te instructions to the T and all I got for it were broken christmas decorations. Dont buy this.
1,3M Command Decorating Clips are useless,"The 3M Command Decorating Clips are useless. No matter how hard I tried, and how carefully I followed the instructions, I was unable to glue them to the wall. I would like to return them but the shipping costs would probably be higher than the item itself. I would recommend you NEVER buy these."
4,Great Price!,"20 clips for such a good price! I purchased these clips so I could hang my paper lanterns up in my dorm room. They remove clean and easy, but make sure you're hanging small/medium wires or else the clip will break. I tried clipping an extension cord and the clip broke. Overall, a good and useful product."
5,Great for christmas,Worked great for christmas lights. Just make sure you leave them on for a couple hrs before putting anything on them. They work really well on my cold windows. Will see how they come off now :) Will be buying them again.
4,hiding the strip,"I noticed a few people mentioned seeing the 3M printed strip sticking out ""like a sore thumb"" under their hook. I used these to hang decorations on the paneling in my kitchen and bath, and of course I wanted to hang things where there were no studs. To hide the strips, I simply painted the strips with leftover paint from my walls. In the case of the white kitchen walls, I cheated and used white out, like you'd use on paper. You barely notice the strips now."
2,Description very unclear ...not what I thought I was getting,"Probably useful for light items like hanging necklaces, etc., but irritated that the description doesn't reflect what you're getting. Would have been quicker and easier to just run down to Staples or even CVS. 2 stars does not reflect the quality of the product...reflects the carelessness of the seller."
1,First photo is misleading,"The main photo with this listing is of the taller, narrower carafe that Bodum calls 1503. What you actually get is a short, squat one, 1504. The second photo and the description are correct, but if you're looking at the first image and thinking, ""Yeah, that's what I want"" ... it's not."
2,Inaccurate Description,"""Product Features"" are inaccurate: ""Fits all Bodum 4-cup coffee press models and styles"". Bodum's 4-cup Melior model is a different size. Bodum does not offer replaceable glass beakers for models that have been discontinued. This is terrible customer service, especially considering that sooner or later glass beakers will break."
5,England - land of hope and glory,"I am so glad this extraordinary film has been remastered, returned to its original edit, and preserved on DVD. I love some of Michael Powell's films -- some I'm lukewarm about -- I love this one. A CANTERBURY TALE is quite lovely. It's not quite perfect -- don't be put off by the little ""glue man"" mystery -- it's a device -- and it works in the overall plot. These actors are superb, and the film is a moving tribute to England and her people during the darkest days of WW II. I cannot say enough about how beautiful it is. Be sure to watch the special features and read the essays in the booklet that all make up this very special DVD package. Don't miss this one.A side note from a native Atlantan -- this is the film which Margaret Mitchell was crossing Peachtree Street to see when struck by a hit-and-run driver."
5,One of Portman's Best,"Haunting, troubling, hilarious, and saddening. Eric Portman was England's greatest actor, and he and the rest of the cast shine in this underrated gem about the nature of truth."
4,Touching and ambiguous evocation of WW2 England,"Beautifully shot, with a mature and sensitive eye, this intelligent and slightly troubling telling of life in a Hampshire village in WW2 is a Powell and Pressburger classic. Catch the excellent lead performance by a US airman (ie, not an actor). This film has great weepie qualities - remember how many were in mourning - but is also engaging, eccentric, intelligent and hugely allegorical."
3,Book Review: Person-Centered Care Planning,"I purchased this book to prepare for a job interview at a not-for-profit mental health organization. The organization is attempting to switch to treatment planning using a person-centered approach. The book is not concise. The pertinent information could fill a thin book. In my opinion, the book was overpriced and long-winded. Borrow it from the library instead of purchasing it."
3,Poorly Written,"Every point in this book is asserted as being ""essential"" or ""vital"" without any support, except for the excessive use of the word ""essential."" Probably could have been about 100 pages shorter and still just as informataive."
3,Ehh...,"I'm not a fan of many of the songs on here. I *much* prefer Sgt Peppers and ""Cutting Their Own Groove.""Listen before you buy. Quality is good."
5,Great seller!,"After I purchase this bed, but before it arrived, my husband arrived home with a brand new one he got at Costco. Needless to say my baby laid on it right away. So I immediately prepared myself for the hassle of having to return my purchase, right? Wrong! What a delight it was dealing with Petsupplyfactory. They refund was processed right away, no hassle!"
4,Interim bed is a home run,"It seems that last November when a major manufacturer of dog beds seems to have collapsed and/or gone out of business forcing most vendors into long backorders that still exist. My Lab's bed was desperately in need of replacing and I found this one that I purchased for interim use. Having said that, my Lab has taken to it and may not let go."
3,Good but not great,"While the bed is very large and fluffy to start with, after a couple of months it becomes very lumpy and will no longer go back to its original shape. The outer cover easily comes off for washing, however the inner mesh (that holds the stuffing) does not come off nor is it water proof/resistant. The inner mesh is also very flimsy and you will tear it taking the cover off and on. All in all the bed is good but has a lot of room for improvement before its worth the price."
2,"Good cover, bad fill","I purchased this bed for my mutts that like to ""nest"" in fluffy beds. The faux sheep skin cover and the canvas/cotton bottom are of excellent quality. I would expect this bed to last a long time -- if my dogs used it. The problem is the fill. My 38-pound beagle mix has been in it only about five times and there is no fill in the spot where he laid. I tried to ""fluff"" and move the fill within the inner nylon bag, but it remains as one big, connected piece that is impossible to adjust or reshape without tearing the bag. It's like trying to ""shape"" cotton candy by handling through nylon material. My 80-pound doberman doesn't seem to appreciate the fill ""hole"" in the bed either and doesn't use the bed."
4,Very fluffy!,"I've had this bed for about 2 weeks now, and as I write this review, my 2 great danes are squished up together on it. I have 2 different dog beds side by side, and BOTH (!) my 120 and 150lb Danes are laying on this one. Now, I don't understand how they could possibly be comfortable, as they are curled up as small as their giant bodies could allow, but it's clear that they are willing to sacrifice space for the fluff. It looks like I'm going to have to buy another one of these so that they can both have one to themselves. The fact that they made the top of it white is not ideal, but I just put a blanket on top of it so that it doesn't look dirty. For the price, I just don't think you could go wrong."
2,Red dog bed,"The bed is fluffy but stuffing doesn't hold up well. Also, what was I or they thinking...WHITE fleece for a dog bed? I was looking for red and this was the closest I could find at the time. It lasted 2 days before laundry and isn't going to work at all."
4,Pet Bed,"I received the bed quickly and it looks as pictured. While it is large enough as I hoped for my Great Danes and they really enjoy the bed but its lost its ""fluff"" and flattened out rather quickly"
1,Spectacular China,The pictures are beautiful but the book is put together very sloppily and is falling apart before it even comes out of the box
4,Vegan family cookbook,Very easy to use with not hard to find ingredients. Also great for the beginner vegan & kids love it! Recipes are fast to make with short ingredients list.
3,Too Basic For Me,"I have been vegan for over 4 years and my taste buds have advanced now. This book is extremely basic and should be titled Vegan Cooking for Dummies. Now if you new to vegan or cooking this would be good for you, but then again most things are just common sense. I did however manage to find some good recipes inside of it. So it has its ups and downs. Do I recommend this???...to the new vegan/inexperienced cook yes... to a more adavnaced vegan/cook no."
1,Cookbook review,"This cookbook does not have pictures and I am a big visual image person. Also they suggest using a lot of ""meat"" substitutes and for those people who truly want to be Vegan, meatless chorizo isn't exactly appetizing. But on the plus side there is a really great recipe for Hummmus. Bottom line, if you like cookbook's with pictures of the entree's this is not for you."
5,the answer to your question,"the track mary and natasha dance to is dajae's 'u got me up' (cajmere's underground goodie mix).it's hard to find. mostly on 12"" vinyl, but there are a couple of(likely out of print) cd's that have it as well. i have it on this cd,available on amazon:http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000001ZUO/sr=8-2/qid=1150569755/ref=sr_1_2/002-1937656-7270401?%5Fencoding=UTF8"
5,Party Girl soundtrack,"The product was in near-perfect condition. As for the expediency of service...WOW!!! Absolutely impeccable! I highly commmend this sender for their reliable and VERY quick response to my request.I look forward to dealing with this party (no pun intended) again, and I strongly recommend them to anyone...Again, thank you!"
3,Great soundtrack but it's only gettng three stars,"Ok, as other reviewers have noted, the BEST song in the entire movie is not on this thing. That's the song that's playing when Parker Posey finally gets serious about learning the Dewey Decimal system as her roommate breaks through in the club.The rest of the soundtrack is a fun mix of club and trance pieces including the title song and ""I'll Be Coming Back"" but without that really cool song, it's only a three star album."
3,a bit disappointing,"This is a feel-good mix of generic house and dance mixes; however, it is a bit disappointing because several of the best tracks in the film are not included on the soundtrack at all."
5,Ex-Cellent!,This is a great cd. I own the movie (which is fantastic) and had to get the cd. The music is fun and a great soundtrack for your own home parties.
1,I was so mad when I bought this back in 1995!,"I went to a sneak preview at USC for this movie where the director didn't even show up. I wanted desperately to like this movie, and it is ok, but from a club kid who was on the scene that year this soundtrack fell short. The best underground danceclub song from the movie, New Jersey Deep by Black Science Orchestra wasn't even on this albumn. How come nightlife movies never seem to get it quite right?"
2,Nah,"Pretty sure this band apologized for this cd in the booklet from their next cd because it was so generic and emo. Check out ""Women and Children Die First"" instead."
1,"""The stink of its carcass hangs in the air""","The ""Carcass"" line in my title is a direct quote from the book. I bought this and read it to my 4 year old son (it says its for 4-8 year olds)and could not stop laughing. It was like a Saturday Night Live skit. The gory details of a Tyrannosaurus on a killing rampage are something one might find in a Cormac McCarthy novel. At one point the Tyrannosaurus kills and eats a BABY Tricerotops: ""Greedy Tyrannosaurus! He tears out great mouthfulls. He holds down his prey with the claws on his feet."" WOW!! How did this thing get past the publisher. This book is beyond belief."
1,Way too scary?,"Absolutely gorgeous illustrations can't hide the realistic and graphic nature of this book. On first reading my 3 yr old remarked that the baby tricerotops' mummy would be very sad now that her baby was eaten and that she must be looking for him. I suppose one must balance the realities of animal life and the innocence of childhood, but with all the shootings and slashing of humans in our city of late, not to mention the escalating incidence of bullying, I found this book to glorify the violent nature of the tyrannosaurus' lifestyle a wee too much. 'Ripping', 'slicing', 'slashing' 'tearing' and 'thieving' are all words I'm not sure I want my child to embrace just yet. This book has been put away, not to re-emerge until my child is a bit older & can understand that not all dinosaurs are like Barney (not that that's a bad thing!)"
1,Author is demented and missed the mark!,"This book is terrible! The dinosaur attacks a baby triceratops in front of other triceratops, which children can only assume are the parents. He ""tears out great mouthfuls. He holds down his prey with the claws on his feet...As he crunches and gulps..."" Are you kidding? Totally inappropriate. Shame on Karen Wallace for writing it, Mike Bostock for illustrating it, and Atheneum Books for Young Readers for publishing it. How could this get published?? Doesn't even deserve one star. This was a birthday gift for our son - I'm glad we didn't waste any money on it!"
1,Materials and Techniques of 20th Century Music,Not a very informative book. Each subject was skimmed over at best. The section on free atonality was especially disappointing. The use of aggregates to analyze an atonal work leaves me cold. It doesn't tell you anything about the music or a particular composer's approach. It becomes little more than an exercise in tedium.
2,Just ok,Just an ok performance. Too many new faces and sounds. Doobie Brothers were under utilized. Not much to do with Lake Michigan.
1,This is not the Beginning but just the Beginning of the end,Gosh this is a shocker - I can understand fans loving the music and the concert but please don't let this be how Chicago are remembered - 1969-1972 they were untouchable Terry Kath was the soul of the band and now we have this end of pier show.I'm heading off to Wolfgang' Vault to see the band in all their pomp around 1970 with Kath & Lamm tearing through their first 2 records. After 42 years this footage is the real Chicago - innovative & exciting. Just watch Terry Kath guitar work and vocals - as Robert Lamm said many years ago 'Chicago died when Terry died'.
1,Terrible!,"Champlin's gone, Parazaider's gone, Lamm sings just sings a couple of songs, Scheff can't sing anymore, I'm sick and tired of the same on and on again (Scheff and Pankow ""talking to each other during one song, and ends up giving each other a high five. It took me a few years to realize that this was actually practiced in the repertoire. Pankow keeps flexing, Lee rises his hands in the air after his trompet-solo, and at the end of the concert it looks like a mental hospital has entered the stage (w/ Doobie brothers).I have been a Chicago-fan for decades, but this is it! Why can't they release the Greek theatre concert from 93 instead? That's when Chicago ruled. Now they just suck. Please don't buy this disc. Whipe your ass with the money instead."
4,Well produced concert film,"This is a great sounding and great looking DVD. The band sounds at the top of its game, and as far as I can tell, there is not a ton of post production overdubs or fixes. Sorry Walt couldn't be there for the taping, although Ray Hermann does a fine job. One minor issue: quite a bit of the audio is slightly out of sync with the video, but not a big deal"
5,Entirely New Mix of Chicago In Chicago,The new BluRay/DVD release of Chicago In Chicago features a stunning new 5.1 mix of this show. The concert was re-mixed from the ground upspecifically for this BluRay/DVD version and reveals far greater detail than the mix broadcast on HDNet. It is an entirely new experience of Chicagoand the most exciting to date.
3,Surprising They Made A DVD Of This,"The band is missing Walt Parazaider on sax here. I don't know who the replacement guy was, and he played well but wouldn't you think they would make sure Walt was available ?I thought the vocals were off in comparison to 2009 recording done in Nashville.I have seen Chicago live 3 times now, in 2010, 2011, and 2012. I thought each live show was better than this DVD.Also, there is no Doobie Brother performance on this DVD.It's great that this band is still playing more than 40 years after its first album, Chicago Transit Auhority. This DVD is not the best, and this from a Chicago fan for life who owns almost every recording they have ver made."
2,Poor audio quality,"Warning- this DVD has very poor audio. it sounds like it was recorded in a canyon, compared to most live dvds. my father and i have several of the chicago dvds and this is by far the worst sounding one. The production/recording of this release also looks amateurish. I was really looking forward to watching this but was gravely disappointed."
5,Chicago in Chicago,Great DVD was as good as I expected. Good audio and video. Chicago has always put on a dynamic concert. What to buy the other one at a later date.
5,Daxspapa,"Can't get enough of Chicago. Really liked the new editons to the group in the keyboard section, sax and percussion. Don't know where Walt Parazaider was but the sax man was great. I'm a drummer and the solo that Tris did was fantastic. The Doobie Brothers will always be one of my favorites too and just like Chicago, when you see them in concert, they sound just like their recordings.....only better! this is a great addition to anyones collection."
5,"Chicago in Chicago....Rock on, Chicago!!!!","Loved it.....good to see the band still playing after all these years....missed seeing Walt Parazaider, but good to see Jimmy, Lee, and Robert! Rock on, Chicago!!!!"
4,A sweet story.,"This is a lovely story. I am not as familiar with the Trinity West series as the rest of the readers, but I think I will haunt used books stores to find the others, esp. Leader of the Pack. Clay was an extremely sympathetic hero and anyone's dream man."
5,Paul's review,We bought this music for our son. He enjoys listening to musical scores from different movies. He has a liking to science fiction.
4,"An excellent, concise manual of common procedures","This well organized little handbook is packed with useful information regarding common procedures in Interventional Radiology. It is a convenient source of quick information for Residents, Fellows or practicing Radiologists. Highly recommended."
5,Excellent Source of Information,"Every nurse working in Interventional Radiology should have this book. Bravo to Kandarpa and Aruny for bringing us this USEFUL, easy to use, information packed book. I cannot say enough good things about it, a must have book.... it's become my survival guide!"
5,great,I have really enjoyed reading my book. It arrived on time and had no damage. I really appreciate the condition in which my book arrived. Thank you very much
5,The Little Bighorn Campaign,"This book is the best overview of the 1876 Custer Campaign available. Because the author has covered all salient facets of this disaster, the novice reader will gain expert status, and the Custer Buff will be challenged to delve even deeper into the Custer mystery. This book is a pleasurable read and will always will be kept close at hand."
5,The Little Bighorn Campaign by W. Sarf,"If you read one book on the Little Bighorn make it this one. I read it in one sitting . . .couldn't put it down. Sarf has given an easy to read, level account of the events leading up to and including the battle. Clear and easy for the novice to follow and yet broad enough for the avid buff. A great over all account of one of the darkest days in American history."
4,Panel Extensions,"There is no doubt that this is a must for the saw since most of the cutting is from full size sheets....this way it is done safely. No doubt Milwaukee thought this thing through and it does bolt up, but I do think that this should be sold with the saw to begin with as why would you buy a panel cutting saw if you can't cut full size sheets."
5,Another good accessory for the Milwaukee Panel Saw,"The standard panel saw without extensions works well for smaller stock, but when dealing with 4X8 sheets of plywood (especially on rip cuts), these extensions are a must. Easy installation as all holes for extensions are pre-drilled in saw. All hardware was in packaging and instructions were easy to follow."
1,Rash city,"I loved this product because it moisturized my skin and didn't make it oily. However, 2 days later....I've broken out in a rash all over!"
5,Excellent product and service.,I got the product in good order and love the product. Thanks for being prompt in sending it and the packaging was safe and arrived in tact.
2,Not For Aging Skin,Short of Botox injections or surgery there are no miracles...especially for older skin.
3,Not entirely unpleasant,"This cream did not work as well as I had hoped. The smell and texture was unpleasant and I did not see any changes as the jar promised. Was not that moisterizing either, I need more water in my skin, not oil or the slick substance that was in this product. I looked forward to using it up!"
3,Another fad,"My daughter insisted on buying the wands with her own money. The biggest drawback is losing marbles/""spell drops"". There needs to be replacements available. One wand does light up and play music too. I tried to steer her toward something more educational; however, sometimes kids just want to play for silly fun."
5,XDXDXDXD,"I Love Magical DoReMi! The show is cool, and now you can pretend you're Katlyn, Dorie, Reanne, Mirabelle, or your own made up character! It comes with spell drops, too! If only there was a wandawhirl..."
5,This ROCKS OUT LOUD!,"I love magical doremi! I have to buy it! It comes with 2 wandalers (which means double the spell drops, haha patina!) and one of dem is mira's! I wish I had it! I have de dreamspinner, but it wasn't at de wal mart store. But now, at this moment, i'm getting that weird vision of tecna from winx club in the doremi drawing style."
4,Don't give up on breastfeeding.,I ordered this pump for my daughter when her son was born.The pump helps to increase milk production. Breastfeedingcan be difficult and very time consuming for some new momsand babies so don't give up even if you have to supplementwith formula. The benefits are well documented so some isbetter than none. This pump works very well.
4,good pump,"I did a lot of research before buying this and I feel it's been a good pump for the money so far (I've only been using it for a week)...it's a little loud and I wish it were more hands-free like some of the other pumps I've seen/used, but it's easy to use and clean."
4,"Great product, but noisy","This pump works great and quickly. Its easy to clean (best if you have a steamer) and easy to use; however, the noise coming from it is so loud. I wish there was a way for it to be quieter. Still, it is reasonably priced and a good quality product."
2,"Works OK, bought Medela instead","I purchased the Lansinoh based on reviews and price, not really knowing what to expect since this is my first baby and have never breastfed. The pump worked okay - the biggest complaint is the noise, the Lansinoh double electric pump makes a high pitched squeak on each pump, which get annoying after a minute or so. We ended up purchasing a Medela after using it at the hospital. I HIGHLY recommend having a lactation consultant help you! Do not try to figure it out yourself. Breastfeeding/pumping is not natural for the new mom - have someone trained help you. It will make a huge difference in your peace of mind and also milk production. Good luck."
5,Great Product,"I bought this product over a month ago and am very pleased with it. Very easy to clean and I really liked that no milk got into the tubing. I had no problems with discomfort during pumping. It does not come with a bag, but I just used the diaper bag to carry it in. I would recommend this pump over the others I have used. It's not the most quiet machine - not too loud and there is an annoying beeping sound when it is on, but it didn't bother me too much."
4,Great so far...,So far it is working great. When I told people I was shopping for a pump - everyone told me to rent one which was very expensive or buy a Medela which costs around 300 dollars. Both would have cost 3 times what I paid for this pump. I've only had it for 1 month and use it 2-3 times a day. My hope is that it will stay working good & last me another 2-3 months just until I am back at work and am done breastfeeding... we'll have to wait and see on that one.
5,Lansinoh is the way to go!,"I bought this pump after tons of research and debating.. With my first born, I had the avent manual pump and it wasn't worth the wrapping it came in! I would have to pump every two hours just to get 2-3 oz! I had my mind made up that this time I was buying an electric. I decided on the lansinoh because of the price and the reviews of its quality and ability to increase milk supply. I have been a mother of 2 for 14 days now and have used the pump everyday. I still breast feed my son every 3 hours and pump for my husband to help at night and I now have 28 oz in the freezer and 16 oz in the refrigerator! Now this doesn't bother me, but the machine is quite loud. Even still, I am so glad I chose this model!"
5,Very pleased,"I am very pleased with this purchase. With my other children I used a manual pump and had ok results. I was able to have a back up supply of breast milk for emergencies but it never seemed like enough. With this pregnancy I decided to try an electric pump but did not want to spend over $200. I did my research and read many reviews. The Lansinoh pump was VERY well priced and the reviews were overwhelmingly positive so I decided to take my chances. I am so happy I purchased it (actually it was a present from my Mom)! I was able to cut the time I used to spend pumping manually in half because you can do both breasts at once. It is adjustable so I was able to find a speed and suction strength that was comfortable and effective. I can not provide any opinions on how effective it would be for those moms who would need to pump multiple times daily, but for occasional, once a day pumping I think it would work perfectly."
2,Loud & not very efficient,"I'm a SAHM, and my daughter breastfeeds just fine, but I was told I'd need a pump anyway. This pump was given as a gift at my Shower, and I only have to use it about once a week when I'm really full and baby is sleeping (or she's already full off other breast). As time has gone by (my daughter is 3 months now) the pump seems to have lost some of it's suction power. I pump for 10 minutes...and end up with sore nipples, still full boobs and maybe an ounce of fore milk. I can hand express my milk better than this pump can get it out.I also don't like how LOUD this pump is. I have to pump in the bathroom under the stairs or else I might wake the neighborhood!I wish I could go back in time and take this item off my registry and replace it with a single manual pump. I feel bad so much money was spent on a product that just barely works."
1,Do NOT Buy This Pump!!,"I just bought this pump at Walmart because my Medela pump just quit on me. I wanted to buy another one but was in a pinch and settled for this one. I just spent 30 minutes trying to pump and I got nothing. The suction on this pump is HORRIBLE. There is no suction whatsoever....it's awful. When using my Medela pump, milk begins coming out instantly. With this, barely two drops came out after 20 minutes. I tired it on every setting there was and nothing. I agree with everyone else's reviews: spend the extra money and get a Medela. They are worth every penny!"
1,They sent us a USED pump!!??,"Package arrived today with all the bags inside torn open, water spots, hair, and other debris around the pump area that touches your skin, and we're even missing some things that are on the ""included"" list. This item was purchased by a friend as a gift from our baby registry so I don't even know how to exchange this for a new one.I don't even know where to start other to say that someone better contact us soon about sending a replacement as there was no contact information on the receipt (actually there was no receipt at all - only a return slip) and I certainly don't want to have to explain this to our friend.Ridiculous."
2,Get a Medela instead and save your breasts!!,"I bought the Lansinoh Affinity prior to having my first child. When I delivered, I had an emergency C section and had to stay in the hospital for 4 days. The hospital had Medela Symphony pumps in every mother/baby room and in the NICU where my daughter was too. I LOVED the Symphony. It really got the job done! I used the Lansinoh twice two days before my daughter was due to come home. I had been pumping at the hospital, but wanted to try at home. Needless to say, I DID NOT like the Lansinoh. It's loud, it hurt my nipples and had poor suction. I did not think the settings were very good at the finer adjustments and finesse needed for good pumping. I got less milk in 10 minutes from the Lansinoh than I did in 5 minutes using the Medela. I ended up going and buying a Medela Pump In Style. Ladies, do your breasts a favor- spend your money on a Medela!"
4,a great pump,"This pump is great. The only reason I didn't give it the 5th star is because it doesn't come with a bag or give any suggesstions on how to carry it back and forth to work while keeping it clean and discrete. They don't seem to even sell a bag for it. But the pump works great, parts are easy to clean and it is a better value for the money than others such as Medela, etc."
4,Great for the price... BUT IT'S NOT SILENT...,"Love it. My breastfeeding experience has split in two: pre-electric and post-electric. For the price, it's a very nice option. Works very well, and has all the options that you'd need. A few cons:1. Noisy. I thought it'd be more silent after the description.2. Your breasts are suctioned by the hard plastic cones. My manual avent pump, has a soft silicon piece which you place in the cone, so your breast aren't vacumed against that hard plastic.3. It would've been nice to have a carrying case. It's fairly small, and a carrying case to keep all the components together would've been a nice touch.Other than that, a very good purchase for the money."
3,Spend the Extra $$ and Buy the Medela,"Enticed by the decent price, I started my pumping career with the Lansinoh Double Electric. You will likely get milk using this pump - it does work. However, this pump does not offer a letdown button option, nor does it offer different-sized flanges if you happen to have other-than-""average""-sized nipples. As a result, I believe the Medela pumps are worth the extra investment. After using the Lansinoh for two months and becoming increasingly depressed by my milk output and increasingly sore from the Lansinoh flanges, I bit the monetary bullet and invested in aMedela Pump in Style Advanced Breast Pump with Shoulder Bag. Since switching, my milk output has increased from 1-2oz/pumping session (with Lansinoh) to 5-6oz/pumping session (with Medela - which features the letdown button and helps a ton). This was my experience...hope it helps! Best of luck with all of your pumping; it's such an amazing and rewarding - yet challenging - commitment to breastfeed. :)"
5,I'm so happy I bought this pump!,"After reading hundreds of reviews-this seemed to be the only one that received good reviews. After purchasing it, I've had no problems with it-except for one small thing. I dropped the plug for it and it cracked, it still works, but doesn't seem to be the best being that it only had a 1 foot fall-but besides that-I've never had any problems! I've had other friends that bought other pumps and said that they have had leaking problems and they have paid almost double what this pump costs."
5,Best pump for your money!,"So far this pump has lasted me 9 months and is still going strong! I originally had the manual pump as I am a stay at home mom and thought that it would meet my needs. Although it got the job done, it took way too much time and energy for just a couple ounces. I decided to purchase an electric one and after much research settled on the Lansinoh. With it being half the price of the Medela and only short a bag, this is well worth the money! Just a tip- I decided to use the free diaper bag that the hospital gave us to carry this in, works great and was free!"
2,Broke within first week of use..,I'm giving this 2 stars because the only good thing about this product is the flanges are comfortable when pumping and that's basically it. The worst part is that it only comes with one size and you have to order them through lansinoh if you want a different size. Even the cheap single hand pumps will come with various size flanges. After using this breast pump for a week the motor started slowing down for no reason and eventually stopped working altogether. Waste of time and money. I was able to pump more milk out with a hand pump than with this thing anyway. Would not recommend.
2,won't work with batteries,"After only a couple uses, this stopped working when trying use it with batteries. It still works plugged into AC."
1,Did not work,Product did not work so now I am out of $121.00 not too happy with the out come. So how I am out the gift card totally and a breast pump.
2,Dump this pump!,"I bought this breast pump based on the reviews I read elsewhere thinking I made a good choice with all the other ones out there. The reviews were 50/50, but I decided to give it a try. Basically after the first month of pumping it started to squeak very loudly and I had to put a pillow over it to keep the noise to a minimal. Also when changing the setting from the mid point to the max point the pump did not pump any faster then the mid point which was very disappointing. I never did get a lot of yield from this pump. Trust me, you are better off with a different pump!!"
1,"Worst pump, don't buy","I went into early labor (6 weeks) so my husband went to the local Walmart & bought this pump. It worked for 91 days. The warranty is only good for 90 days. It is extremely loud, has a lot of parts, and I didn't like having to pump then pour the milk in a bottle. After this sorry pump died, I did rent a Medela. Lots of parts too but much quieter. I then bought an Avent single electric & realized what I'd been missing. Even though it was a single pump, I was able to pump more milk in less time (for both breasts) than either of the previous pumps. It's quiet & pumps straight to a bottle. Lansinoh nursing pads are good but the pump is absolutely terrible"
2,Short-Lived,"I bought this pump while I was pregnant because of the reviews and the trust I had in previous lansinoh products. After having my baby this pump was fantastic. I loved the settings and that it felt like a hospital grade product and gave me a great milk supply. 1 month into using it once a day and it has now stopped working regularly. I have tried everything, replacing parts, changing plugs, still nothing. It works for about 3 seconds on the let down phase and shuts off immediately, unless I quickly change the suction level. I called customer service and they are no longer manufacturing this pump so if you purchase it and something is faulty, they will not be able to replace it, only refund you. Just a quick FYI on my experience. I am disapointed, I wish I would have went with my original choice of the avent double pump instead."
2,Dissappointing . . .,"This product looked good and came with storage bags and the lansinoh nipple cream samples. However, it's performance as a pump was quite disappointing. I had been using an avent manual pump daily for my son's supply for the creche/daycare center and typically got 12 oz per session from both breasts in 30 - 40 mins. With this pump, i got barely 3 oz from both breasts after 30 minutes of pumping!Also, it has more parts to fit together than i care for. I had read reviews and some found it great but sadly, that wasnt my experience."
4,Great pump!,"Ao far I have usingthis pump every day for more than 2 months. I pump and bottle feed my 4 month old boy. I find it easy to assemble, easy to clean and get good amount of milk in about 20 min. I am a first time mom and this is the only pump I've used, so don't have any comparison. Good thing about this pump is that it comes with some spare parts. After using for 2 months, 5-6 times a day, the white valve get loose. I just simply replaced it, it works well again. I don't think this one is noisy, obviously every one can tolerant different level of noisy. The noise can't keep my awake at night when I pump and my baby even finds the noise soothing.Overall I recommend this one. I got it from Target for $150. This one here is a good deal."
4,A lot easier to use than Medela.,"I used the hospital grade Medela Lactina for about a month and a half and while that one was quieter (not by much) this one is more convenient and takes up less room.The suction is not as strong as I'd like it to be, but for $150 you can't complain about that.The pump makes a weird beeping sound when in use, so if your child is a light sleeper use it somewhere where you won't disturb the baby."
1,"American Splendor , Harvey Pekar","I think Harvey Pekar must appeal to young ,semi hip people. I donated my purchased copy to a local hang out called The Boiler Room."
5,review,"I loved the movies, I think everyone should see what is going on on the planet, because it's affectong all of us. Ed Norton does a good job!"
2,Olivier Ruined Hamlet,"While the acting is excellent, the interpretation Olivier gives Hamlet is nauseating. As a Shakespeare scholar, I have always cringed when I hear students of the bard describe Hamlet as a ""man who could not make up his mind."" Oliver tells us at the beginning of this film the very essence he sees in Hamlet. I have *no* problem with him interpreting in a way I do not agree with, but to say this is the ""definitive work, period"" is unfair to some other wonderful adaptations. For my money, Branagh's Hamlet is a more honest portrayal and the excellent dress rehearsal Dvd with Richard Burton is mind-blowing.I do not dislike Olivier, but Hamlet is hardly his best Shakespearean work. Richard III is much better and Henry V is perhaps better than Branagh's version."
4,Nice little book,"I ordered this book after taking A&P as I enjoyed A&P very much and also like history. It is what its title says, and the author does a good job of it."
3,Not what I expected,"I began researching my family tree a few years ago and discovered that my ancestors began to arrive nearly 400 years ago. In at least one case junior was thrown out of his father's house for developing radical religious views; he was a Puritan. I was curious to know why. The pastor at our church recommended this book.For my purposes, I have been disappointed. The book does gather together and quote many interesting primary sources but I was looking for a more detailed summary of what the colonists believed, and why their father's disowned them for believing it. Letters written between two Congregationalist ministers isn't what I had in mind."
1,Worst camcorder I have ever bought.,"I bought this camcorder less than a year ago and once again it is not working. This is the second time that something has broken on it. It is not worth the money, buy a Sony."
4,Great summer time read,"I found this book to be a great story dispite my having very little knowledge of the technology involved. It's interesting to get a feel of what compells these hackers to probe into forbidden territories. Some reviews have mentioned vilifying or playing up the cast of characters, but there is a careful balance of inspired genius and social dysfunction presented as two sides of the same coin. It does not often take great technical skill to be a hacker. Many of the passwords and other proprietary information are gleaned over over the phone by ""Social Engineering"" where an employee is duped into giving out private information. Mitnick is also more than just a hacker: as a fugitive he is working against those he feels are after him, and he uses his skills to brilliantly foil law enforcement operations seeking him out. Someday someone will combine these books into one great suspense movie."
4,A good journalistic account,"This expose-style account of the misadventures of Kevin Mitnick is far more detailed and a much better read than the descriptions by Markoff and Hafner in *Cyberpunk*. It exposes egotism in its subjects with a kind of sincerity that makes no pretense at ""objectivity"" but which is convincing nonetheless. It also makes those of us who were secretly cheering for Mitnick all along feel justified, as he is depicted more sympathetically than the mainstream media have done in the past."
2,"A book about hackers, but not about hacking","After reading Littman's ""The Watchman"" this book comes as a disappointment. I expected a complete story of Kevin Mitnick hacking. I would like to have read about what he did and how he did it. Sure, the book is crammed with anecdotes, but there is no nice t o read story. The book has been written from the interviewer's point of view. How he talked to Kevin, Eric Heinz and others. This is not a book about hacking, but about the life of hackers and FBI informers."
3,"Better than similar books, not great","I wish this book had been focused on the media coverage of ""hackers."" The book does expose how tech companies, and the media, especially Markoff from the NY Times, exploited Mitnik and his story. It also shows the incompetance of the FBI and other agencies in dealing with Mitnik, trying to make him an example for others and nearly making him a martyr instead. This story has no heroes, and its painfully noticeable that even the author is milking the ""hacker"" phenomenon for what its worth. It is the pathetic world of a computer prankster, his malicious ""friends"" and a host of others determined to pad their resumes with Mitnik's misery. ""The Watchman"" was more informative and satisfying, however this is the most fair and balanced treatment of Mitnick's story I've read."
1,Not Very good,"Buy the Watchman and the Cuckoo's Egg, and maybe even At Large, but save yourself some money and skip the Fugitive. The book seems to be patched together out of boring, roughly transcribed telephone conversations with Kevin Mitnick while he whines about his life slumming ""underground"" and avoiding capture. I thoroughly enjoyed the author's other book, the Watchman, but the Fugitive was a sore disappointment."
4,No such thing as ethical hacking,"Face it, whether you're a white hat or a black hat - hacking is hacking. Alas, the term ""ethical hacker"" is merely a way for those breaking the law to rationalize their behavior. Littman did a great job of exposing this great debate in the book. In the field of information security, Mitnick is known to all of us as the king of social engineering. Let's be completely honest (even Mitnick and Littman exposed this in the book)... Kevin is not good at hacking but rather at exploiting the human factor. That is - humans are the weakest link in this whole information security thing - not the systems themselves. You want to design a secure system? - educate your users, administrators, managers and executives on how to be wise and vigilant and adhere to a sound security policy.Thank you to Mr. Littman for showing us the many sides of Mitnick's life. I look forward to reading about Poulsen next in ""The Watchman""."
5,An excellent description of Kevin Mitnick's run from the law,I found the book to be a pretty accurate depiction of Kevin Mitnick and his encounters. Jonathan Littman is a fine author who gets the facts right. His books do not appear to be biased in any way; he's a real example for other authors out there.
5,Only Book I Found Sympathetic To Kevin Mitnick,This Is Only Book I Found Sympathetic To Kevin Mitnick & I Loved It. Very Factual I Found It Better Than Most Books About Him. It Kept You Wanting More .....
2,lots of clumsy writing here,"Littman tries hard in this book to make Kevin Mitnick out to be a noble hero, but it doesn't quite work. I admire the effort, though, and feel like it is a much more honest take on the subject than John Markoff's Takedown - which is, in my opinion, a truly bad book. If you're a hacker, there's lots of good information in The Fugitive Game. For a fuller understanding of Kevin Mitnick's life, and the fascinating and twisted world he comes from, as well as a nicely balanced appraisal of his crimes, I'd recommend Jeff Goodell's The Cyberthief and the Samurai."
3,"This is a book about lifestyle, not technology","If you're interested in the technical side of Mitnick's computer vandalism, you won't find it here. You will, however, get a glimpse into his personality and lifestyle, as well as an idea into those of other famous computer criminals of the '90s.It is well written, however, as Littman is a professional writer. Contrast this with ""Takedown,"" in which you're given a lot of techical information, but the writing is a bit less refined, as Shimomura makes his living as a scientific computing expert.Take it for what it is."
1,Not only DID NOTwork...,I installed it and immediately had issues reconnecting an Ethernet bridge to my wireless router. I was also unable to login to work over a VPN connection after the install. I had to uninstall the software in order to connect things back up.The documentation was beyond my understanding.
1,3 Dead Media Centers,For some reason my 3 Gateway XP Pro - Media Center PC's will NOT network so I bought this to solve my problem ... NOT! So much for networking from my internet PC to the HT PC to my 3 month old UNUSED! 42 inch Plasma screen. For the 50 bucks I spent on this Soft(Limp)ware I could have bought binoculars to watch my neighbors tv. Ah the joys of the high tech age ...
2,Unpleasant smell; try a different Zum mist fragrance,"While I love Zum Mist's frankincense & myrrh and the lavender fragrances, I find this patchouli very unpleasant. It's way too strong. Zum Mist is a great product, with the right fragrance. For my nose anyway, this is NOT the right fragrance."
5,They did it again,"Wow they did it again BONECRUSHER realeased a new album .15 new tracks of hardcore in your face american oi. If you like old BONECRUSHER realeses you have to love this new album ""FOLLOWERS OF A BRUTAL CALLING"" as much as i do i cant take it out of my cd player i recomend you get this cd a.s.a.p."
3,LA Hardcore,"Bonecrusher was recommended to me as proper manly music. I don't know much about music genres, as I'm too old and dignified to care about such things, but it is my understanding they are exemplars of the LA Hardcore scene. There are a few good tracks on here, and it is indeed proper manly music, suitable for working on your jeep or lifting enormous barbells (which is the pupose I put such music to), but I found the record to be ... hard to put it in words ... rather flat. They don't seem to have the animal rage to drive forward what they're trying to do. It's like they're going through the motions, or need a nap or something. Compared to the raw hatred and anger which flows from, say, a ""Blood for Blood"" record ... these guys just don't have that level of intensity. Still, their hearts are in the right place, and it's worth a listen for variety's sake, but I wish they'd put their skateboards away (or whatever) and get in more alcohol fueled fistfights."
5,Great whistle.,As a soccer coach this has been a great tool during my practices. It's very loud and seems very durable.
1,Missing templates,"The subject of this book is how to create envelopes from printed materials using the plastic templates included in the back of the book. They were missing from the book I received. If the advertisement for the book had stated the templates were missing I would not have purchased this book, because without them the book is useless."
5,BEST BOOK FOR NATURAL HEALING RESEARCHERS,"The 3rd and LAST edition (100 printed) was published in October, 1947. This book has been used by people around the world, who are studying and researching Natural Healing products. This work was written by the brilliant efforts of the Yale School of Forestry. Up to this day it is unsurpassed by those people extremely interested in Natural Healing Products. The book was recently reviewed by Alan Kurz, who is considered by many to be one of the foremost leading authorities on Natural Products due to all the research he does on Natural Products for better health."
3,good but not great!,This was decent fantasy novel but I thought it was probably the weakest in the series.Once again Deitz takes us to the war-torn land of Eron where Avall the war hero and reluctant young king must try to find ways rule his country by keeping the various clans happy.But Avall's problems become worse when a fanatical clan called the Priest cult plots to overthrow him and seize the magical jems that Avall used to defeat Ixians in the war.The problem I had with the book is that the characters behaved in stupid matter and even though the priest cult was suitable fanatical in the aims they were poor villians in comparision to King Baraxx from the previous two books.
4,another asian boy band,"this cd has two songs that have become me and my girlfriend's ""song"" until you come home and my everything are two awesome slow jams. overall good cd"
4,It's good,It's a good cd because this group is from hawaii but it's junk cuz the only good song is until you come home.
1,"Don't, just don't.","Got this for my Prizm. It is made of a kind of heat-resistant plastic but it is too thick so it was pushing the two parts too far apart so that the clamps were not able to seal properly. Make yourself a favor, get some alternative that is maybe $1 more and don't weld the two pieces like I had to do."
2,Seduced by a gambling system,"One thing that many people in mathematics get 'seduced' byis the idea of winning at gambling with a 'system'.Since mathematics is really a very 'poor' areaof scholarship, the temptation is great, since card counting actually worksto beat the house odds.But as some learn too late, the 'house' takes a very dim ( leg breaking)view of card counters. This movie of a young man headed for disasterand banning from major table gambling is hard for me to watch.A gambling addiction is one of the worst diseases that you can have...But money does strange things to people, makes friends into enemiesand lovers into something wildly different. Then brown thingsstart flying around..."
1,Count me out,"Starts slow, gets leaden. Saw this with a group of friends of various ages, none of whom found it less than annoying. I laughed out loud in an early scene where student Ben Campbell (Jim Sturgess) impresses professor Mickey Rosa (Kevin Spacey) by answering a probability question about a car and two goats behind three doors. Apparently the screenwriter and the director don't realize he got the answer exactly wrong.I'm all in favor of poetic license to make an entertainment film more interesting. And nobody takes very seriously a film or book claim of ""based on a true story"".But nothing about this film rewards you for the suspension of disbelief required to sit through it."
1,AMERICA'S CRITIC,"A BIG FLOP WHATS MORE TO SAY SO OUTER SPACE WITH THE GAMBLING COUNT THE DVDS THAT ARE 1CENT ITS PRALLY 21 MILL,,, CRAPPY MOVIE AND CASINOS WILL CATCH ANY DUMMY THAT TRIES THIS AND CUT UR HANDS OFF!!!"
2,"Read the book instead, the truth is much more interesting!","Entertaining, if predictable, telling of the MIT kids that took millions from Vegas. Having read the book, I can tell how much the story was Hollywood-ized, and none of it was for the better. Still, not a bad movie, and the fact that it was based on non-fiction is cool."
5,Good movie,I really enjoyed this movie. It was better than I expected. Definitely worth adding to your blu ray collection. Its a movie Iwould consider watching over and over again.
2,10.5 on a scale of 21,"I watched this movie for class. It was interesting to see how they counted cards to beat the casino, but like many movies it was only entertaining until about the half-way point at which point I stopped watching it as the plot became predictable and boring."
2,True story - the Hollywood way,"Yes, students were from MIT and yes, they played blackjack, and yes, they won a lot of money. This is as much as the story has in common with facts. The movie succeeds to make an average movie out of an interesting story. Students were actually taught a winning strategy that was the work of a mathematician and used it to win in casinos. There was nothing brilliant at that. Maybe the innate self-confidence of MIT students made the realization of the project possible. It is typical for movie directors to rather stick with tried fiction templates than to tell a much more interesting real story. But I guess they must know what brings more money. And, of course, it takes so much less effort--they obviously believe in recycling."
5,Now I want to learn how to count cards,"My trainer was talking about this movie in the gym, so I bought it. 5 star movie. While it's not one of those blockbusters, the movie gets the job done. Numbers, counting, math, money, money, and more money. Great movie."
2,Does Not Capture the True Story -,"""21"" is based loosley on the book about six MIT students who count cards and took Vegas for millions.It did not translate to the screen well, and becomes boring. ""21"" needs to capture the excitement of gambling and the risks the students took to please a cunning MIT professor, Micky Rosa (Kevin Spacey). The professor has culled the top math students at MIT to ""count"" cards to make a bundle in Vegas. Ben Campbell (Jim Sturgess) needs money for the $300,000 MIT tuition. He is logical, cool, and plans his life accordingly. The proposal Professor Rosa makes to him gives Ben second thoughts, but he eventually caves in, partly to be with his lady-love, Jill (Kate Bosworth).So Professor Rosa and the six students become card-counting experts, with a goal to swindle millions out of Las Vegas casinos.The film is based on the nonfiction best-seller. Bringing Down the House: The Inside Sto"
3,"""Card Counting-Revisited""","It is a good movie, however it delivers very old news! Editorial review suggests more than card counting will be employed by MIT intellectuals. The movie however shows in detail what the late famous card counter Ken Uston described in his book, ""The Big Player"" published in 1977 .It's thus disappointing if you are aware of Ken Uston's works including his numerous court cases to reverse his barring by casinos. It should be very interesting to those who are not aware or familiar with Ken Uston's works. Despite this criticism the movie still manages to impress to a point."
3,"""Card counting-Revisited""","It is a good movie,however this is old news.Reviews on the movie promise new stategy that MIT intellectuals will be employing in addition to card counting.The movie instead shows what the late famous card counter Ken Uston described in the book ""The Big Player"" more than two decades ago.It is thus a bit disappointing when you are aware of this,but should be very interesting to those unaware of Ken Uston's works.Despite this criticisism,however the movie still manages to impress."
4,"Entertaining Film, however a bit predictable!","A Brilliant student from MIT strives hard to join Harvard Medical School. He doesn't have the required tuition money to join Harvard and as a result has only 2 options, either earn a difficult scholarship or arrange USD 300,000 to pay the tuition.In one of his Math classes, he impresses his teacher with his mathematical logic. Later on he is invited to join a secret gambling team led by his Math teacher that travels every weekend to Las Vegas and win lots of cash. This student accepts the invitation for the sake of having enough money to join Harvard Medical School.This movie is quite a long one, but because it was entertaining we didn't feel the time.It reminded me of Ocean's Eleven.Unfortunately the fate of Kevin Spacey and the student at the end was very predictable."
4,I've alwasy liked Kevin!,Add this one to your collection of fun and easy movies! Kevin won't let you down! :)
1,gambling glamor made boring film,"This film is ""inspired by"" a true story told in the book Bringing Down the House: The Inside Story of Six M.I.T. Students Who Took Vegas for Millions (2003). In real life, the MIT Blackjack Team devised a complex scheme of card-counting, disguises, and hand signals to win four million dollars in Vegas before the heavy hand of casino security gave them the boot. This film follows that outline, but it's a pale imitation of a genuinely interesting tale of greed, intellect, and emotion. Kevin Spacey stars as the MIT professor Micky Rosa who bullies, badgers, and betrays his six students in venial Vegas. The dialogue is horrible and at points entirely predictable. There's no character development. The sub-plots about friendship and parents hold little interest. The plot does take some unexpected twists, but even this resolves in a cheesy ending. It's quite a feat to make a boring movie about the glitz and glamor of Vegas gambling. Skip the film, and read the book."
4,Fantasical Adventure,"Based on a true story, the movie makes the gambling and risky life style very glamorous.My thoughts:- settings, props, buildings, scenes are all believable and adds to the realism- it looks too easy to maintain that lifestyle. Flying from the east coast to Las Vegas every weekend? That's exhausting. I can't imagine how it's possible to keep such composure through the night.- Kate Bosworth. Goodness, she is charming and beautiful.Adventurous movie. You'll feel like you're right there by their side while they're winning or losing."
4,21,fun film to watchnothing screams oscars but its a good movie for whenever you need something to watch-kind of predictable but a sick ending twist-gambling scenes are fun to watch-genius envy for the characters that graduate MIT with a 4.0-dont have to be a genius to count cardsall in all a good flick
2,This is not bringing down the house,"If your expecting a movie about the book 'Bringing Down the House' you will not be happy about your rental/purchase. I didn't believe the poor reviews at first and so I rented it...I wish I had listened.The story is narrated by our main character throughout the film and it is horrible to listen to for both content and the annoyance of his voice.They really Hollywooded up the plot, with all the predictable twists and happy-ending everything-is-ok-in-the-end and we-have-learned-our-lesson bull-s...There was just nothing at all that stood out about this movie. They could have replaced BlackJack with any other activity, like skydiving, tennis, or working at a McDonalds and they could have reused much of the script and the plot lines. The second star is because I didn't shut it off part way through.Wait until this one makes it to HBO."
4,21,"'21' is a good film looking at a group of college students who engage in a card counting 'scam' in Vegas. Based on true events you can't help but be impressed by the skill involved and very quickly you are drawn in to the idea and how they go about it. The performances are all pretty solid and this film is also well directed. This is one of those films you don't have to think too hard for and can just sit back and enjoy the ride. It's not earth shaking, but nor does it try to be. It's just a good film with an interesting idea and enough twists and turns to keep you engaged for the duration. Worth a look.Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page."
3,Blackjack movie,"Movie about the kids who played blackjack and tried to out play the system and win allot of money. The Evil teacher was very well played and the kids seemed too old to actually mirror the real people who did actually live this story.I liked it because it tried to follow the real story somewhat. In the real story, a whole bag of money was found at the campus that was mistakenly left behind. And that was what started to unravel the game."
2,"MIT, Vegas, and Nerds, Oh MY!","great commercial to remind you how to enjoy life in Vegas, one of the most exciting cities I have experienced in my life, at least when the economy was rolling, especially when hangin with a high roller, getting the penthouse suite and spending winnings, very very addicting.... OK that about sums up the film for reality check, the rest is too bogus to expend energy itemizing.... just how inane that MIT students would conspicuously cheat and dang dude get a safe or lock box!!! enuff said, nada redeeming, lessons learned, glad those guys won the 209!!! peace"
3,3 Stars Good but not Great,"Many of the other reviews talk about the storyline but I am writing this just as one man's opinion. 21 was a fun movie to watch. There is nothing extremely captivating about the movie. I was honestly more enthusiastic to watch the movie than I should have been. Something about the story line of going to Vegas to beat the odds is fun and it gets the addreniline pumping even as you watch but in the end you know it will come crashing down.The bottom line about this movie is that it has a decent story line and is entertaining. 3 stars is a perfect rating because although I would recommend it to most people, if you have something else you have been really wanting to buy then buy that movie instead of 21"
2,too much dramatization and unbelieveable from time to time,"this movie has a lot of dramatization. and things hard to believe, such as beating up a card counter... many books i read said that they only tell you not to play at the blackjack table ever again. i'd recommend watching Breaking Vegas (2004) which is a more accurate story of what actually happened."
2,Spacey Must Have Been Desparate,"Aweful film! Bad acting and even worse story. To think a group of higly educated college students could play as a team weekend after weekend and not be discovered right away is insulting. Vegas is way too advanced to get conned like this. I realize this is a made up movie, but come on."
3,This movie is alot like blackjack should you stay?,"This movie is a safe bet with no real risks. All the major plot lines are there, nerd likes hot girl, needy guy needs money for med school, do gooder teacher is actually a villan. The problem is that nothing really gets explored. Its like the director does not know if he wants to hit or stay and ends up playing with little risk. The movie flows and the ending was not entirely expected. If you are on the fence about buying this movie ask yourself are you risk taker than go ahead and buy if you stay on a 15 than you should walk away."
3,21,"I always enjoy gambling movies including the classic ones like ""Cincinnati Kid"". Although ""21"" is reasonably entertaining there aren't any stand out performances including from the experienced Stacey or Fishburne. This is a rental unless you have a heavy interest in this take on the six M.I.T. students that counted cards and won millions of dollars from the Vegas casinos. Although certainly worth a look I didn't feel surprised or impressed by anything in the movie. It just seemed like mostly a rehash of ""Oceans Eleven"" with college students. If you enjoyed this catch ""Gone in 60 Seconds"" and ""Fast and Furious"".CA Luster"
2,Disappointed with this one,"I went into this with an open mind. I am a huge fan of Kevin Spacey, and he has yet to disappoint me...until this one. This movies premise is great but it was not very believable. These kids are geniuses, yet the go to the same casino and use the same signals for things. Doesn't make a whole lot of sense. I had high hopes, but they fell, fast."
2,Jigsaw of a movie,"The only reason this will get two stars is because of Spacey's consistently great performance. Aside from Spacey, this movie felt like multiple movies attempting to flow into each other, without much success. Numerous cliches are approached throughout, and for a movie focused on gambling, there was barely any blackjack being played! It was mostly a melodramatic teen/college coming of age story or ""life experience drama"" or whatever you want to classify it as. Do yourself a favor, and if you would like to see a pretty good card movie, rent/buy Rounders."
4,Fun night in,"How can you not like a movie with Kevin Spacey??? I liked how this built up not only to recruiting of the students, but also to realization of what's important to them. Kevin Spacey is conniving in his supporting role and makes me remember his line from a previous time ""I rule!"" I enjoyed the performances and although the storyline was rushed at times, it was still good for relaxing entertainment."
4,21 A Good movie,"There is only one Las Vegas movie out there that is worth five stars and that's Martin Scorsese's Casino with Robert Deniro.I saw the trailer couple of months ago before going to see it. And From what the preview was showing it was going to be a slack buster. But as it turns out this movie is very entertaining, and very well acted. If you want a good movie that will keep you going, I strongly recommend you see this both to buy or rent.It has some awesome scenes and a good little twist at the end. Very good film. 4 stars"
2,Haven't we bet on this script before? And Won?,I can't think of the exact movie... but about 10 minutes in I thought I'd seen this all before. About an hour in I knew every part of the ending. It was an absolute cliche' from opening credits to ending credits. My god- it even had a VO Montage ending.If you're dying for a kids version of Ocean's Eleven- this is it. If you want 'the Goonies do Vegas'- this is it. If you want a good movie with a decent plot and a lot of believable characters who can act... this isn't it.
4,21,This movie looks great in the Blu-Ray format. The Las Vegas scenery is gorgeous. The story is interesting and the characters are believable.
1,"Frankly, garbage","This is NOT a movie of Bringing Down the House, which was a very good account of the experience of being part of a team of Black Jack shysters. The script writers clearly did not understand the type of card-counting being done in Bringing Down the House, which is probably why they created this bogus back-story about a brainiac college student (very unconvincingly acted by Jim Sturgess) that had nothing to do with this kind of card-counting, which is done by teams and does not require one to be a brainiac, just detail-oriented and observant, and able to follow directions. In addition, the first sample presented in the movie of his mathematical prowess was that he knew how to break 100% up into 3 parts...which made his professor take a second look at his paper...at MIT no less...which is even more unconvincing than the acting. Overall result? Embarrassing."
1,Awful,"Terribly disapointing movie. Kevin Spacey mails it in, playing the same likable villain he played in The Client, minus the southern accent. Choopy, uneven, inplausible script. No character development. Just a waste of time."
5,I've been waiting for this DVD!,"I've owned the VHS version of this for years. But until recently it wasn't available on DVD. I'm excited to finally be able to get it in DVD format. I also ordered Shalom Jerusalem and the new Extravagant Worship DVD.Paul Wilbur's music is awesome, and I can't wait to get all of them. And free shipping, yay!!"
2,Narrative Ideology - Not for Beginners,"As the title suggests Genette revisits his narrative theory expounded in his earlier work ""Narrative Discourse"". This book focuses on criticism directed at Genette's earlier work. Genette does not elaborate on his narrative theory. Readers will need to be familiar with terms such as paralepsis, prolepsis, analepsis, syllepsis and achronies. For university students studying narrative ideology. Genette's earlier work is recommended before endeavouring to read what is essentially an extended ""afterword"".Genette does not critically analyse any authors in detail and tends to focus on French, rather than English or American authors.Students wanting to read a more basic overview of narrative ideology should look at Jeremy Tamblings ""Narrative Ideology"". Tambling covers Genette in a more 'user friendly' manner and provides helpful illustrations on the mechanisms of narrative ideology."
2,Disappointed,"I've wanted this bag for a long time and finally decided to purchase it. Unfortunately, the $10 bag I have been using from target has better storage compartments. The ones on this bag are flat so items don't pack as well. The hanging hook must be tucked carefully inside each time you fold it up and the string to tie it up is hard to use. The back side compartment is pretty useless except for possibly undergarments - brush or curling iron don't fit well if you want fold it up. After fighting with it on two trips I'm happy I didn't throw out my old, way less expensive bag."
5,As good as it gets in English,"This is the edition of the Holy Bible for English speakers who want the best translation in accurate English with archaic words replaced with modern words while retaining the Elizabethan version of English. This version also includes the Deuterocanonical Books (Apocrypha) which were published in the original 1611 KJV edition.The layout is very good and clear, making this edition easy to read. Except for the Psalter, this updated KJV is very good for liturgical use.I'm well over the age of 13."
3,beutiful pictures lacks material,"I am sorry to say that Mr Tedeschi's book is lacking. he is by profession a wonderful designer but not a taekwondo Master. His book is a good roadmap for the beginner that lacks adequate instruction; but, not a research nor reference for anyone who has done the martial art or sport for any amount of time. The book lacks substantial information on advanced techniques , combinations and the strategies for sparring, Additionally there is little to guide the practioner toward the practicallity of Taekwondo. That having been said the book can offer some mechanical insight into the techniques of TKD for the beginner. But definetly not worth the price tag."
4,Intriguing,"I read this book when I was fourteen when it caught my eye at a library with a painfully small teen section. I think that the book was very interesting in the way that it showed the girl treating her family, and the way that her family in turn responded to her. I also think that the ending was beautiful. It is a book that I wish that I could read again."
4,Suspensefull,"I really liked this book. It kept me interested the whole way through. As a diary writer myself, it was right up my alley. I wanted to find out what had happened to poor little Gloriana."
5,A Quality Case,"I'm an avid table tennis player and recently purchased this pouch for my paddle. I chose this particular model by appearance of design quality. The bag will accommodate two paddles and has a smaller pouch for balls or accessories. I recommend this pouch, however, if you're a frequent player, I think manufacturers could be pressed to offer a larger bag which could accommodate paddle cleaning accessories, additional balls, and towels for personal use and table cleaning. When I go to our local recreation center, I incorporate this bag in a larger carry case. The case does serve the purpose of protecting the paddle's integrity. Of course, if you use inverted rubber on your paddles, you will want to be sure to cover the rubber with adhering plastic to prevent exposure to air to maintain effective ball-friction properties and prevent detioration."
5,Table tennes Bag,It really fit and protec you paddle perfectly with space for two paddles and a front outside space to carry at least a dozen of balls very good finish and quality of details
2,"Not too bad, not great","First off, the designers of this product obviously never installed them. They are an absolute pain in the A to install. The spring design sounded cool, but really is quite useless and actually counter productive. It makes getting out harder than a fixed unit would. It tends to bend down and in, kind of ducking underneath the truck. Another flaw is that the bolts interfere with each other, you're better off making your own brackets. Even the washers that were included did not work as they were too wide to fit where they were intended. The one thing I do like is the look. And the function would be nice, but the solid unit would offer more function."
1,Died at 13 months,This router worked great for 13 months and then just went completely belly-up. I notice I'm the second person to state this. Beware.
5,Casca The Damned Review,A good story set in the dying days of the western Roman Empire. Casca returns to Rome to find Christianity has taken hold and has to prove his worth in the arena and gain his freedom. Fighting against the Goths he is captured and witnesses Rome being plundered.After being set free he leaves the fighting and returns to Helsfjord and finds it deserted. This is a very poignant passage and brings home just what eternal life means. Eventually he returns to the empire to fight against Attila and the Huns and this is the climax of the story.Very good and well worth a read. For more on Casca and other stories see www.casca.net
2,"Interesting man, horrible narrative","As another reviewer mentioned, the telling of the Mosby story is done so awfully. I could not finish the book because I was not able to get into a rhythm (keep in mind I read about 3-4 books a month). Parts where you're expecting to have details he summarizes in broad strokes, meanwhile in other places pages and pages are spent on meaningless points.I gave the book two stars because when the narrative is good (in a few places) it is very good and you learn some interesting facts. There are also some excellent photos/illustrations.Other than that, I just got done watching a Civil War Journal episode done on Mosby and it pretty much summed up much more effectively what Virgil took about 300 pages doing. It doesn't look like there is a solid bio out there, other than his own memoirs. I should have started their in the first place."
1,Painful reading - disjointed and stilted language,"I bought this book with great enthusiasm due to the reviews I read here. It has taken me three weeks to literaly ""plow"" through this disjointed and just plain difficult to follow narrative. The attemps at literary fluorish are constant distraction and hinder the reader's progress. This book is written as if someone simply took various accounts from other sources and cobbled them together with no idea how to make truly fascinating events into a readable story. There are areas where there is given painfully intricate detail in non-essential minutae and then where there could be benefit from detail there is only the briefest passing mention of important events. There has to be a better book on this."
5,Great buy,I bought this watch for my husband's birthday. He loves it. It is a beautiful watch (the blue center looks even better in person than in the picture) and it arrived in perfect condition. It is a great watch to wear whether you are wearing buisness dress or just dressed casually.
5,Great and nice watch for the price,"Very good apperance/looking watch for less than 60 dollars. Robust and nice, very good option for a working / party watch. Great blue and fantastic apperance."
3,"Great concept, failed delivery","The three stars are almost entirely for the concept here and probably too generous. This is one of those ideas you read and wonder why no one has thought of it before, and it really excited me. So it's tragic the concept was entirely wasted. The movie plays more like an long episode of Murder She Wrote or any bad cable movie. The production is average, the soundtrack--what little of it there is--adds nothing. The acting is average. There might be a sum total of five minutes of relative suspense. Character development is particularly poorly handled--we have no investment in any of the characters, especially the protagonist; he's likable enough, but without depth he's just an actor hitting his marks. In the end it's a waste of time. That's a shame...and a sham. Wait for it to hit Prime so at least it's free."
3,Not a Must Have,"For the fans of Stacey Kent you know what to expect from her voice and her phrasing. It is simply superb. But I found this collection problematic with the recording of the songs. The recording did not show off the vibrancy of her voice, in fact, tended to muffle it. Certainly it could not accomodate the pyrotechnics her voice she can do with her voice. I was very disappointed and much more because the price of the cd was quite expensive."
2,Really good to watch to put you to sleep.,"Seriously if you find yourself unable to sleep, put this on and you will be out quickly, boring is a massive understatement! True or untrue, I dont really care, but I did manage to get a good nap in!"
5,Au Pair 3: Adventure in Paradise,I'm telling you now if you are a BIG FAN OF AU PAIR BUY THIS DVD. Au Pair 1 and 2 are hard to find. I did buy Au Pair 2 but I can not find Au Pair 1. Buy this movie and you will not regret it.
1,Hated It! Worst movie I've seen this year!,"Hi I am [...]and I hated this movie! The characters were stupid, the plot was boring, and the whole movie just dragged on. Save your money and buy something worth the money! Or don't spend it at all! I wish I could get those 90 minutes of my life back!"
2,just ok,"Ciara is a real generic artist,but hey who can hate on Eye-Candy? there ain't much to Her vocals.and when you have heard one Lil Jon cut you have heard all 99 of them,but this cut is aight if you at the club sipping&dancing.but unless she finds Herself she will be seen&Heard as a Janet Jackson/Ashanti Knock Off&there ain't alot of room for to many clones there.if Ciara can get a Mya type run then she will be very lucky,but Novelty cuts like this make that seem kinda hard to imagine."
2,Minimal Talent And Recycled Beats (2.5 Stars),"Ciara's single is pretty generic and her singing ability is minimal at best. She was totally off key for the majority of the song. Lil' Jon recycled this beat for a third time (Petey Pablo's ""Freak A Leek"" and Usher's ""Yeah"") and at this point I'm just tired of hearing the same loop over and over. Her second single (1,2 Step) is much better than this one. If she can somehow manage to step her vocal game up she might have a chance at sticking around. I'd reccomend skipping this one."
4,Okay,It is much better then her new track OH. She is still a horrid singer thought. She has no singing talent whatever.
1,repulsive,"hearing Ciara's pathetic voice, Petey Pablo's incompetent rhymes, and Lil Jon's horrible, horrible beat on ""Goodies"" makes me want to hang myself."
1,Avoid buying at all costs!,These discs are horrible. I bought a spindle of fifty and only had 2 successful burns. I'll never burn to memorex ever again. Avoid at all costs!
2,not compatible with Toshiba SD-R5372,"0 out of 4 discs that I tried to make either did not complete the burning or failed the verification. Strangely enough, those that finished burning (even with failed verification) seems to work ok, though I did not extensively test all the files in my burned disc.I ended up trading it with someone else at work.Switched to Verbatim brand discs and all is now well."
1,Dual Layer DVDs just don't work,"I have tried many times, and have nearly used up the entire supply, and have yet to have one of these disks actually work on any of my 4 DVD players of different brands. They are all newer DVD players and I have burned with 3 different softwares, but each time, whether I play on my computer or one of my three home units, not only doesn't work, but locks up. I don't know what the deal is, but I have very dissatified."
1,Memorex DL only will hold the regular 4.7. Shoddy Quality Control,"I bought some Memorex dual layer DVDs and imagine my suprise that not a one, using any burning program will recognize it as being more then a standard 5 Dvd. After trying 10 in a row I just trashed it. What a bunch of crap. I was wondering why I had so many still and now Im reminded. I use Verbatim for DL important stuff but memorex for short term then shred storage.Dam are they rip offs. Verbatim. The DVD single or DL to use."
1,Stay away,I bought a spindle of these and 2 out of the 1st 10 were successful and the others were unusable. The two that worked have wide visible gaps on them when you look at the burned sign. I wouldnt trust my data on Memorex dual layer DVDs.
1,TERRIBLE DISCS!!!!! AVOID THEM!,Go for Verbatim. I've burned over 300 Verbatim DVDs.. NO COASTERS. First time trying Memorex because of lack of options... 5 bad burns in a row. The 6th one worked. Seriously bad discs...
2,Iffy discs at best,I have recently purchased a 25 pack of Memorex dual layers. I am using my Sony Vaio computer with dvd burner. I have never had bad luck with dual layers before. But the first 3 out of five discs I tried to burn always had errors about %50 of the way through the process. It is always a burn error. I also had 2 more bad ones after one successful. That's 5 out of 8 coasters. Not very happy about it with these costing about $1-2 each.
1,Very dissatisfied,"I have been using Memorex DVD+R DL discs to copy films on DVDs. Almost every copy ends up with a bad spot on it which doesn't read later when trying to watch the film. This in spite of no error messages during the copy and no problems playing the original DVD. Perhaps one disc in 10 gets a media error on write so that the copy doesn't even complete.I disconnect the PC from the network while copying and make sure that no other programs are running. Copies are made at a 1x speed on a 2.66 Gh Pentium 4 with a Sony DW-D26A writer.I never had these problems with Memorex single layer discs but the double layer discs seem to me to be very unreliable. After doing some internet searches and seeing the experiences of other people, I have to blame the Memorex media for my problems."
4,Kenneth Texas,This is a great product for the money. Not one coaster so far and doing everything that I expected it to do. Now with more and more movies coming out longer that 2 hours it seems that the needs fits the demand. Memorex thank you and Amazon thank you for the great price and fast service.
3,It's pretty cool~,"This book is great!! It has Bible verses along with a quote to paraphrase the verse for teenagers to understand. This book is pocketsize, which is very cute :) I rate it a three because a lot of quotes in this book I've already seen them from other places. I kind of expected something more than just bunch of quotes. This book is totally great, but it just doesn't meet my expectation when I purchased it. I would say this book is great, but not like super helpful in my opinion. But with this prize, it's worth buying :)"
5,Great product!,"Don't hesitate! I searched for a hydration pack long and hard. Tried on many models and for the price, features and comfort, this bag was pound per pound the best one in its category. The stitching, and material seem pretty sturdy and well done. Very light weight, even when filled with water, my wallet, phone, bike tools and Gerber tool. Has a mesh compartment for a bike helmet, and two compartments for storage. My first use was on a bike trek with a friend. Rode 22 miles and had no problems with comfort or otherwise. Can't wait to see how it holds in the cold for some cross-country skying. Great product!"
3,Good Purchase,"The Lobo is very light and can hold plenty of water for a long bike ride, but it could use a bit more cargo space and I am not sure if I get any benefit from the hip strap. Also, taking out the reservoir to allow it to dry every time I use the pack is a pain. Despite these few weak points, I am, overall, quite happy with the Lobo."
5,perfect for the reason it was created..hydration,this item gives u hydration n it can evenn b filled with ice i love it
2,Good for reference only not direct use w/ kids-no pictures!!,"Buy this book only if you can't come up with appropriate social stories for your child(ren) on your own. I did not realize there were no illustrations with this book and there were only a handful of stories that were appropriate for my child. I ended up writing my own stories and drawing my own cartoons. In essence, the book provided little value to me or to my child."
5,Very Pretty!,"These are Christmas gift for my wife, so she hasn't worn them yet. They are very pretty however! I think she'll love them."
5,Excellent addition to drama library,"If you can only purchase one book for your drama class, make it this one, or its companion, On Stage. This book worked with third through eighth graders in my drama classes, and helped them get stage ready. It's fun, easy to use and contains activities the students ask for repeatedly."
5,Great Activities,"I LOVED this book and Lisa's other book. I think her games and activities are great ways to get kids interested in theatre. Keep up the good work, Lisa!"
2,Mundane,"You have to admire a man who sells his apartment and borrows from friends to finance his first film. But as much as I respect Whit Stillman for the efforts he went through to write and direct Metropolitan, I'm afraid I was utterly bored by his movie. The screenplay is not particularly good, the acting is stilted and unimpressive across the board, and I didn't give a damn about any of the characters."
4,****,"I actually think unless you connect in some personal way with this film, you may find it slow. I connected with it watching it in college, because I went to an expensive private college and hung with this type crowd. And then after college I was the post-collegiate guy out in the workforce in the bar: ""The acid test is whether you take any pleasure in the question: 'What do you do?' I can't bear it."" I obsessed over that line for YEARS because that was me. I couldn't bear that question either. But just this year I had a massive career break where I'm one of the major creative talents in two projects, each of which will cost over $120 million, one of which will probably become world famous upon its completion. I've thought of METROPOLITAN a lot lately because I'm no longer that guy at the bar!!! I now take GREAT pleasure in people asking me, ""What do you do?"" It's such a relief."
3,Not worth the price,"""Metropolitan"" is an interesting movie but definitely not worth the asking pice."
4,"Very smart, insightful, ironic humor. A great flick.","I found the acting to be well done, the characters extremely well developed and sympethetic in their own way."
4,You gotta have it,"What's to say, if you purchase IR lights, you gotta have one to be able to use them (most IR lights DO NOT come with 12v cord) these are inexpensive, but they work. From China, but what isn't?"
2,coil nails,These nails kept getting jammed in a new Bostich sheathing nailer.looks like the spacing is to narrow because when it fires a nail and advances the coil the next nail is not fully under the piston. It will work for a few nails but then cut a nail in half. Ordered Bostich nails to see if they work better.
4,Siding Nails,"I ordered this nails one day and needed them the next so i use fastest shipping they were delivered on time and these nails hold tight, I got used like new so there were a few rolls that were a little out of round but nothing to worry about this is my second box and have used them on cement siding and cedar fencing I would recommend this product."
3,Expected in better conditions / Esperabamos mejores condiciones,"I expected the book to be in better conditions, it has stains on the sides.However, since it is a very good read, we did not care.Pages are in good conditions for reading. No highlights, marks or the sort.This book is of great value for couples looking forward to marriage, or married couples who wants to improve their relationship.Many practical instructions for daily life.Esperabamos el libro en mejores condiciones pero tiene manchas en el lomo y los costados.A pesar de esto, es tan buena lectura que estamos contentos con el libro.Las páginas se leen bien, no están marcadas ni tienen apuntes.Este libro presenta gran valor para las parejas que piensan casarse o los casados que quieren mejorar su relación.Contiene muchas instrucciones prácticas para la vida de pareja."
3,disappointing but worth your time,"The title implies that this will be a study of liturgy from the perspective of the discipline of drama. To some extent this is true, but more often the perspectice is based on the anthropological studies of ritual. As would be expected from the author's background, the sermon receives significant emphasis.Some of the author's horror stories of bad liturgy are delightfully memorable. Here and there, there is an understanding specific to the author; in general, however, this is simply one of a group of equally decent introductions to liturgy."
3,Item no longer as pictured,"Just be aware that this item is no longer made as pictured, unfortunately. Equinox has changed the design and there's no longer a see-thru mesh front panel. Now its solid nylon material throughout. Though it's lightweight 'sil-cloth' material, the lack of a see-thru panel was a definite minus for me, because its harder to keep track of what small items are in what bags. I never had a problem with the durability of the previous design & it was very practical, so its disappointing they got rid of it."
5,Word cannot explain...,"Honestly... this is probably the greatest CD I've purchased this year. It is definitely a much different album than their previous release, but DAMN is it just as good, if not better! Damn... ""Daylight in the City"" is definitely my favorite track on this record."
1,disappointed!,There first cd was easily 5 stars but this is easily a 1 star performance. There are no stand out songs on this cd at all. The last cd had 4 or 5 standouts and many well written songs but it seems they used the last 3 years off to be anti-war activists then writing good quality songs.
2,different but still ok,The cd is not bad it just is not that great either. Their debut was much better and I am disappointed on the style change. Hopefully the next cd will be a nice in the middle mix of the 2 styles.
2,"Not horrible, but not good either..","The last cd, even though it wasn't THAT great, was better than this. It had a few winners on it and of course Piece By Piece. I listened to this knowing it wouldn't be as heavy based on what I've heard but I didn't expect a lackluster outing with no catchiness or hooks. Sophomore slumps."
3,one out of two not too bad,"The tamron 70-300 mm lens works great and autofocus with my Nikon D40x camera. The Tamron 28-80 mm lens works great, but the autofocus doesn't work with the Nikon D40x camera."
4,Good for the money,These lenses are good considering the price. I have since sold mine but I would recommend them to a friend.
2,Betrays the original,"Uses contemporary language better than most, but ultimately doesn't justify the many liberties it takes. (In at least one instance, a disciple's identity is actually changed!) ""Humanity"" as a translation for _ren_ is not improved by being capitalized. Wade-Giles romanization."
1,Kongzi the miserablefailure,"I ordered this book because of the reviews. Actually I ordered it expedited delivery in September but Amazon had problems and I didn't get it until December (no refund). So, I began the introduction in the excitement of belated but final achievement. In the fourth line I stopped, ""The most influential sage in human history ... 'his had been a disappointing life'"" Hello. Sixth line ..'needless to say he failed miserably'. So the judge, Hinton, decides the life of a man who has had more effect on the ethical structure of China and much of Asia, is not up to Hinton's standards. I threw the book away. Garbage. No credible writer is that bloated with his own importance."
1,Pointless,"I watched this movie, having unfortunately bought into the hype. However, after 78 minutes I was left thinking what was the whole point. Yes, its a movie about revenge - but how jaded is that idea? The two protagtonists seemed to stumble from one scene to the next - the film didn't seemed to 'flow' well. It was as if the producers were trying to shock their audience with each scene. I was not horrified, as some people have been, by the anti-male udercurrent in the movie (all it portrayed was that some women hate men. Wow!). However, I would not view this as some masterpiece of arthouse cinema. The violence was not as graphic as Tarrantino has been (especially in Dusk Till Dawn, where he was particularly gratuitous) Similarly the violence was not as random as Natural Born Killers. The sex scenes were annoying and pointless (all they showed was that men are only thinking of sex. Again, wow!)Maybe I have become completely desensitized, but this movie was irritating and annoying."
3,"""Do you want to feel my balls against your ass? Huh?"" [Bam Bam Bam]","This is an unusual movie that's relentlessly dark and depressing in certain moments and perversely mirthful even to the point of twisted hilarity in others (as in the above quotation). We shift seamlessly from the sisterly bonding of the two women to brutal and careless violence. It is definitely hard-hitting and doesn't pull any punches compared to many American movies which glorify either violence or sex, or present its characters as either saints or soulless villains.Plotwise it's difficult to tell what's going on at times especially toward the beginning so close attention to the plot is necessary.Definitely not for everyone, though. Some may be offended [...]"
1,"Avoid this movie, it is not worth the 77 minutes","When I saw the DVD of this movie, I immediately bought it, even though it is a french film (Most french films are kinda ""off""). My expectations were very low and the moment I saw the menu screen, I knew that I made a terrible choice. The movie feels like a home video (which is not bad), but zapping through the chapters (and it's only 77 minutes long), I couldn't find anything interesting about the film. Zero. The actors are ordinary, the dialogue is lame, I guess the only positive thing about this film is that I can hear how the French really ""curse,"" for a lack of anything nice to say about baise-moi. If you want something gritty and so-called ""real,"" try to find the movie ""La Haine,"" it plays better. Baise-moi, no thanks."
1,*Not Disturbing. Crap Porn*,"This is a weak, pathetic attempt. Maybe it's just a low budget Euro-trash porn. The plot: hideous girls (one a rape victim and the other a hooker), meet up and drive around France killing people and plot revenge on the male species. Very boring and disgusting porn due to the grotesque, epicene cast. DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME. Not a soul on earth would want to ""baise"" these girls!"
5,An English Dubbed Vesion sounds terrific,"Even though this movie is in European French, it would be terrific if it is Hollywood English Dubbed. The english dubbed version would have famous Hollywood actresses. Even I think this movie is terrific even if it is english dubbed, this movie should not be banned anyhow because it is unfair for most audiences 18 years of age or older would love to see this movie even if they are porn fans. Unless they make an American version of that movie called Do Not Terrorize Me, it should not have any porn scenes. They should be replaced with erotic scenes which is cleaner."
2,Rape me...,This movie is the french version of Thelma and Louise (same story) but with more violence and sex scenes. For fan only.
2,dillo's reviews from down under,"For a film to deal with the proffered subject matter as Baise Moi has done, you do expect some harsh and unpleasant sections to crop up. However, Baise Moi seems to have rejected all attempts at a coherent/plausable storyline in favour of constant gross shock. Production is smooth, and the camera work is very good, but it does all seem a bit sensless, reeling from one abasement to another, without even lipservice to rationality. If you want to see explicit sex, save your mon, hon, and buy some genuine XXX which usually has at least an attempt at a storyline."
3,is it art or is it porn ?,the above question was taken from a review of 'rape me' (or the french title 'base moi'). my answer to that question is that it's neither. 'base moi' is low budget exploitation cinema. there are attempts at the start of the film to portray a gender based message but that is quickly abandoned for fairly explicit sex and amoral violence. if you're a fan of films that are more shocking that stylish or innovative i'd definitely recommend this film. if you enjoy alternative cinema go see it but if the most shocking film you've ever seen is 'reservoir dogs' i'd say stick with tomb raider.
1,Baise-off,"Well as if there aren't enough reviews but I just can't resist. Controversial? Yes - in the same way pornography and extreme violence are always controversial. Challenging? Yes - giving the film a chance and not turning it off after 20 minutes because it is so boring. Pioneering? A new and untapped level of tedium and crass shock tactics? No, tedium and crassness that can be seen in any low budget porn film that tries to take itself seriously. Am I missing the point? No, there really wasn't one."
1,Horrid - Skip it,"Terrible revolting film. This movie is a disgusting third class ""controversial wannabe"". For those who want to see quality cutting-edge filmaking see Kissed, Crash, or Breaking the Waves---even In the Realm of Senses. Try not to get conned into watching this; or if you do see it, do so for the sole purpose of studying how not to make a movie."
1,Junk,"The box claims that this movie is Thelma and Louise with penetration. It's more along the lines of the imfamous tripe called ""I Spit on Your Grave"". If you are after porn, buy something else, if you are after a good movie, buy something else. Here's the plot, if you can call it that, two women drive across France killing innocent people in gruesome and sickening ways. Every once in awhile they have sex. That's it. On the technical side, this DVD has the worst picture of any DVD I've seen where the source material was post-1930. It's very grainy and looks like it was shot with a home-quality 8mm camcorder. The quality of the manufacture of the disc itself was in question as I hade to put the disc in the player over and over before it would play."
1,Le Peeeeeeew!!!!!,"This film was pretty lame. It was also quite boring, even with a short running time. Maybe the film would be at least partially enjoyed if it weren't promoted to be something it isn't. We're talking about nothing more than trashy B cinema here, and it should have been promoted as such. Instead it seemed like the joke was on the audience, having been lured into this movie by it's gag only to find out it was a cruddy Thelma and Louise wannabe. Baise-Moi isn't as original as it seems to think it is either. Remember the other attempt to bring hardcore sex to mainstream film, Caligula? Remember that failed as well? Before you storm the foreign section for this title, desperate to see what the big deal is, I'd suggest taking home Caligula instead. It may be 70 minutes longer, but it's not nearly as boring and you'll get many more laughs out of it."
1,12 MINUTES CUT OUT & NON-LETTERBOX = DONT BUY IT!,"If you can't handle the movie's material, then grow a backbone! but for REMSTAR to not even release the FULL VERSION (this is cut by 12 minutes) and present it in FULL SCREEN format (original aspect ratio is WIDESCREEN) is more shocking and despicable than the film! DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY on the U.S. version! there are other UNCUT/LBX DVD versions out there (I know the Asian version has BOTH theatrical & hardcore versions on 1 DVD!)the only way to show these GODHEADS at the U.S. releasing companies that WE, the people that put food on their table and allow them to have the lifestyle that they do because WE PAY FOR THEIR LIVES, DO NOT WANT CUT-FULL SCREEN GARBAGE such as this release! email or call REMSTAR and complain about this and force a RE-RELEASE of this great film! (film 5 stars)"
2,"a little bit of eye candy, a lot of lousy film-making","The eye candy comes from seeing the two quite sexy (but not necessarily ""beautiful"") lead actresses in a couple of pretty good and very graphic (as in *hardcore porn* graphic) sex scenes...the rest is just painfully bad, poorly acted, poorly directed and overdone. Sure it's trying to provide some IMPORTANT SOCIAL COMMENTARY, but does so very poorly...no comparison to ""Thelma and Louise."" Feels like it was done by some horny high-schoolers with Daddy's camcorder and a very big soapbox.Definitely not a date movie, nor a particularly good Rosie And Her Five Sisters movie either."
2,Baise tu!,"With the same level of explicit sex as Catherine Breillat's 1999 film ""Romance"", (which is far superior) ""Baise Moi"" makes up for lack of plot by adding in lots of pointless violence.The film quality is poor, it is highly grainy in texture. There is also a minimal of plot - basically a road movie a la ""Thelma & Louise"" only more suited to porn.Banned in my country due to the excess of violence, I was non-the-less able to view this by ordering in a DVD copy from overseas. I'm glad I didn't have to sit through this at the cinema!This film already has 'cult' status because it was obviously made to shock, rather than entertain, & in this at least, it succeeds.Baise moi? Baise tu!"
3,Try to watch it a second time,"Maybe if one wouldn't keep their hopes up. The characters are interesting, but it's just too short."
1,Infinite Inhumanity Meets Infinite Stupidity,"Nobody should watch this movie. No, that is not a reverse-psychological invite to view the movie - it is a vile, grotesque, inhuman, degrading movie, lacking all common sense, all logic, all ethics, all morals. It is blatently crude and has no redeeming social importance what-so-ever."
1,shock does not always equal art,"I don't even know where to start with this one. Amateurishly directed, badly acted, metaphorically obvious (a woman is being sexually penetrated and she looks up to see an image of a gun on the television...how subtle!). A movie with an obvious political agenda...all men are scumbags and perverts, therefore it is alright for angry women to commit acts of rape and murder. The film strains so hard to be shocking and disturbing, but the only disturbing thing about it is that gullible people will be fooled into thinking it's a work of art.I can't stand movies that treat gender issues so simplistically. To reduce the complexity of human relations to a cut-and-dried,black-and-white worldview as this film does is truly criminal. Movies like this are harmful to your health.And don't assume that I'm some close-minded chauvinist jerk or that I'm not familiar with shock cinema or foreign films, either."
3,No English Subtitles on this version...,I once owned a version with English subtitles that was better... Other than that this version is good. All the raw violence and sex that was intended.
2,Not a good way to enjoy a relaxing evening at home with the wife and kids!,"I think only the French could produce such a film: it is unerotic though sexual, vicious and violent and has a fairly thin story line. Two abused prostitutes go on a spree of violent revenge on men and end up on the run like Bonnie and Clyde. I watched it all the way through and didn't really enjoy it (it's not supposed to be enjoyed I guess) and I may give it a second airing to see if improves. Definitely not for the faint-hearted or squeamish!"
1,Scummy and Unpleasant,"The filmmakers, of course, defend this movie as not pornography as it's not supposed to be erotic. Yet during an early rape scene, the camera focuses on a shot exactly like you'd see in a porn film. Why? Was that necessary? But the again, these filmmakers didn't seem to be all that interested in making a film but just an unpleasant journey for the viewer and they succeeded.This film is no French ""Thelma and Louise."" The latter film features one act of violence done in the heat of the moment. This film features premeditated violence, most of if pointless and sensationalistic. There's nothing noteworthy about this movie, not the performances or the cheap filming style. It's just a lousy excuse from lousy filmmakers."
3,"Violent, but not as horrific as reported","The film's title does not, translated directly, mean ""Rape Me"", but ""... Me"", and the two protagonists do plenty of that in between bouts of violence that probably got this film banned in its country of origin (the French are less tolerant of cinematic bloodshed than of sex).This violence includes an upsetting rape scene, shocking rather than educative as to that horrible crime, which might be what motivates one of the victims' teaming with a prostitute (Catherine Bach)to indulge in casual sex and violence, done with a vulgar amorality which works if only because their portrayals, and situations, seem caricaturish. ""Baise-moi"" is filmed in grainy, uncomplimentary colours, showing a France different from the one seen by tourists and even viewers of French cinema. The film in neither likeable nor dull, and certain scenes remain in the mind afterward."
3,Natural Born Killers meets porno,"Both my wife and I liked this movie more than we thought we would. Its Natural Born Killers on porn. Disturbingly, each killing and sex scene gives you a rush like riding a roller coaster. The director was obviously trying to turn the tables on your typical violent sex movie by empowering the female characters in the movie."
2,More hype than art,"After having heard so much about Baise-Moi, I was actually fairly disappointed. Yes, it may have broken some new ground with its graphic sex (the violence you've seen before, and done better, in 100 other films)and brutality, but certainly not enough to start a whole new genre. The problem is, the sex seems to be there only for its own sake; it follows no rhyme or reason. Nor, for that matter, does the violence. I know it was supposed to be random, but even that's kind of covoluted. It's really difficult to have sympathy for the 2 main characters, because they're victims of their own doing even before they go off. And the film is not only surprisingly short (77 minutes), but it just kind of ends, with no true resolution. Maybe worth seeing if you can get a copy cheap."
1,"Plagiarism and exploitation, not art!","This movie is only an unimaginative mix of Thelma and Louise and Natural Born Killers. Exploitation, that's all!"
3,No where near as bad as other reviewers said,"I found the movie to be nasty and fun. The violence was a little too cartoony for me to take very seriously (although that one in the sex club was nasty)and the sex was good, but I kind of liked the dialogue and overall thought the movie was ok.The dvd's transfer wasn't terrific and there wasn't much on it besides the movie. I would have like a commentary or interviews with the stars to see what they made of the movie, but that is life.Overall, three stars and two of those are for the filmmakers [for making] this movie.Ok, flame me..."
1,Meaningless pornography,"I could potentially accept some elements of pornography in the movie if this serves some purpose (like in 'Empire of Passion' by Oshima). But in this movie pornographic clips are totally meaningless. The movie itself is very pathetic and extremelly boring. It is very much like amateur home-made movie. The only thing that is common with 'Thelma and Louise' is that both movies have two women running loose as main characters. I understand that creators and actors came from porno business. Maybe it was their attempt to move to mainstream. Well, their attempt failed."
2,one has to ask why?,"This is certainly a very rough-to-watch film. One is spared the blood spattering of the bullets entering bodies, but one is spared very little else. Obviously two very angry women. I would think that the graphic nature of their anger could have been presented in a more palitable manner. On the reviews shown on the DVD, both the positive and negative reviews were shown, and that is an honest plus. If a person wanted to view a film of two angry women then I would recommend Butterfly Kiss; two English women on a journey of destruction with better acting and far less graphic."
1,wow...,"So this is the movie that is supposed to shock and awe me!? this movie has been hyped up to be one of the most violent and disturbing movies of all time, but i found it to be the most poorly made piece of crap i have ever seen. the acting is horrible (thats what you get from porn stars)the camera work and editing is chopy and hard to follow, and the special effects look amature at best.I love to push my limits when it comes to movies, thats why i was so excited when i found this on ebay for ten bucks. i watched this movie twice just to make sure i didnt miss anything,and i did...4 hours of my life.This is pretty much a low budget porn flick, not a good movie. so if your looking for some hardcore sex action, go get a good porn. if your looking for a movie that is shocking and violent, check out ""irreversible."" but what ever you do, stay far away from this movie"
2,"low budget natural born killers movie, kinda boring","I watch it once don't want to see it again, even though i have watched natural born killlers 50 or more times, both films try to shock, this film is boring ,the script is worthless, nothing funny and the dvd transfer was crap grainy, the box cover was the best thing this movie had to offer, rent this dvd. i didn't listen to the bad reviews of this film, i wish i did."
1,Don't waste your time on this lame porno/drama.,"Baise-Moi was a French film that caused a lot of controversy because of it's hardcore content. I thought I would take a chance and buy a copy of this flick. It's not all that and then some. The movie's nothing more than a glorified porno with a few scenes of violence thrown in. You'd think they would throw us a bone and have a girl-on-girl scene, not even that!Not worth anyone's time or money. Just a lot of hot air over nothing.Not recommended."
2,Two stars for the rape scene....,"I thought I had reviewed this film already....but in checking out the site, I noticed Amazon negated my review...so I'll try again!Come on perv's out there....why buy this film if not for the ""graphic"" sex scenes right? Well, the rape scene was graphic, however, it failed in all other aspects miserably! This is one senseless violent act after another comitted by two rather normal looking, cheap whores! I wouldn't waste my money on this one...in fact, I returned it to the store I bought it from!Enough said?"
4,Does not disappoint,"A review of all her early, but great TV designs. The book offers the reader the luxury of examining all the details of Candice's design at his/her leisure."
5,Candice Olson,"This book by Candice Olson on design is one of my wife's favorites. She has been a big fan of Divine Design on HGTV, and this book is like the show, witty and shows great design ideas."
4,Now you know how she does it.,"This book is the information we all want to know about how Candice creates the beautiful rooms seen on Devine Design. The advice she gives in her book anyone can follow to get the results we all want. This book is a keeper to anyone who wants their surroundings to fit their lifestyle, without ever haveing an outdated look. Plus there is great information about Candice herself."
3,Wanted more designs,"I love Candice's show, but was disappointed in this book. There were only a few designs covered, and not enough information to make the book worthwhile. I like the tips and tricks she gave, but would have liked more insight into how she makes her rooms amazing."
4,"fun to look at, pretty helpful.","We ordered this book when we were planning to redo our kitchen. The book was most helpful because it had a few tips (like where to place recessed lighting) that we did not see elsewhere. We're planning to do a lot of the work ourselves. Otherwise, we found magazines specifically for kitchen remodeling that helped us just as much in terms of finding what styles and placement we liked."
5,The queen of interior spaces,"To me, Candice is one of the best designers of today. She makes a room feel classic with a punch of todays trends. None of the to trendy, cheep looking items that will be out dated by the time you finish your space. She is a master of timeless beauty. I love her book!"
3,The book is not as good as the TV show,"I bought the book cause I just love Candice's work and design. I admire her projects.But the book is definetly dissapointment. My first impresoion was that the paper that was used to print the book - a cheap peace that destroyed the quality of the photos in it. Also, the text that goes with every design project do not say anything interesting or helpful."
3,Seems dated...,"Book was OK for inspiration, but it seemed very dated. I was hoping to see more floor plans, too. I love her and her show so I was excited when I saw this book online but when I got it was kind of blah...Pretty good though for more of a sneak peek into Candice's personal life and how she grew up, etc. It was interesting."
2,Candice Olson on Design,Very tastefully designed book. Pictures are truely worth a thousand words in everything she does. Simply an excellent read.
4,Pretty good but...,"I feel that Candice did not give enough credit to Chico (who, as all know, is the real brains behind this operation!)"
2,Candice Review,"Candice Olson on Design containg many beautiful pictures of her work. I can say to all, but many of the rooms are from the shows from HGTV. However, I was disapppointed by the lack of explaination of some of the design ideas. My purpose of this purchase of this book was to give rationale to some of her design ideas and how I could implement them into my home. This book was very non-general and mainly for someone whom may want a picture book only. An even so, The photos never keyed into her usage of lighting. Which she always incorporates for any of her rooms. Your better off watch the show or DIY."
2,Not Thrilled,This book wasn't what I expected. I absolutely love everything Candace does. These photos were too simple. Looked like pictures of things she must have done when she first started designing.
1,Sorry--Not worth it,"Though I love Candice, and thought this would be the best of the three books I purchased, I found this book is too old to be useful. The pictures do help you realize just how quickly decor can become dated though. Not a helpful resource in my estimation."
5,Lots of great pictures,Candice Olson is one of my favorite designers. Her book has been a great use to me in helping my own clients view pictures that help them imagine what their rooms could look like. Job well done.
4,"Good, not Great",Makeovers described in general terms. Pictures choices were not that impressive. The book was not as exciting as the TV makeovers are.
2,mediocre at best.,"My wife is a big fan of Candice. She has done some large remodeling projects on our homes over the years and isn't exactly a novice on these types of things. I thought this would be a no brainer as far as scoring ""hubby"" points and bought her the book. Big mistake, while I didn't read it I was told by the wife that this was nothing more than worked over material from previous shows with a few tid bits thrown in to spice things up. She did say that there was a bit of interesting background on Candice but reading the book in general was a disappointment and waste of time to say the least. Bummer I say!"
2,Disappointing,"I like almost everything that Candice Olson does on her tv show. Traditional with a twist, or something to that effect is her motto. This book was published in 2006...not so long ago, right? Everything in ths book is pure, boring, traditional. There was not one picture that spoke to me AT ALL. Purchased from a Good Will, and cheap, so I'm not really mad, but it went straight to Savers."
4,Jane Eyre from a Christian perspective,"As the previous reviewer states, this study guide offers a lot of thoughtful, interesting questions, as well as vocabulary exercises and quizzes. The guide is geared to high school students, and would provide good supplementary material to a unit on Jane Eyre. Buyers should know, however, that it is written from a Christian perspective, and therefore also includes questions based on particular biblical passages as they relate to the novel. This is certainly not a bad thing, but not something I expected."
5,Somebody bring J.I.M. Stewart back into print - please!,"A British banker travels to Italy to meet his wife's first husband's illegitimate son and arrange care for him. What he discovers there changes his life in a way he could not have imagined.J.I.M. Stewart was a British professor of English literature. His novels are elegant, quiet stories, focusing mainly on school life, the art world, or upper middle class manners. He also wrote the marvelous Appleby mysteries under the name Michael Innes. If you enjoy wonderful, literate writing, and you happen to come across one of his novels - don't pass it up!"
4,Amden Terrarium,Prompt shipping. Nicely made & packed. All screw holes align properly and all parts fit. Edges of glass are bevelled. Lots of padding in the packaging. Am well pleased - worth the price.
4,beautiful terrarium,"This terrarium is beautiful, and I am very happy with it. I subtracted one star because one side of the terrarium's glass was shattered in the box. However, I contacted Amazon and was issued a refund for the price of replacement glass. Customer service was very helpful and pleasant to work with. I was happily surprised that the process was quick and simple."
1,Think Twice Before Buying this Book,"I am one of those people that are always looking for books and literature to motivate me. I stumbled on this book, Focus on the Final Seconds by Almon Gunter, and I have to say, the book did not motivate me. I did like the fact that you could write your own thoughts in the book while reading it, but still, I did not get much out of the ideas and concepts he presented. His ideas were nothing new or earth shattering. His voice or tone of the book seemed preachy and a little self-serving, not giving me the impression that he was motivating me, but talking down to me. If you were looking for a book to motivate you, I would consider other options."
4,Good reference book,Women's Rituals; A Sourcebook by Barbara WalkerI like the book a lot. Many usable ideas for ways and means of implementing women's retreats.I recommend this book to any serious minded spiritual seeker.
1,Rituals,One should have many like minded friends to do these rituals. It is more of a historical trip than how these rituals are helpful.
4,Smile,"I had this cd years ago back when cds were still fairly new. It was stolen from me, and I looked high and low for another copy. Very good record."
3,"Please read, the mints are great!","The mints are great, the reason for the 3 starts is the delivery. You see my son is in the NAVY on a warship. I have not seen him in almost 2 years. The ship was due back in March and he was going to come home for a two week visit. The week of his return I got an email from the ships Ombudsman that the ship was re-routed for another mission. No one would say how long, or what for. I immediately began putting together some care packages. The health food store where my son use to buy these mints went out of business in 2010. I found them on Amazon with expedited shipping available. I paid the extra money for the shipping. I won't get into the long story as to why I needed to get these packages off to my son, but I was working with a very touchy time line. But inspite of the extra money I paid for Amazon prime 1 day shipping with FEDEX, I ordered Saturday March 31st, they came wednesday April 2nd! I know it seems a silly thing to be heartbroken over, but I was."
5,"finally! a wonderful ""mint"" with no unpleasant aftertaste","I purchased this product on a whim thinking I'll try it. I assumed it would probably taste overpowering. Much to my surprise, these little mints did exceed my expectations. They dissolve slowly. The flavor is nice and light, with hints of jasmine and ginger root. They don't leave an unpleasant aftertaste. As a plus, the mints are free of sugar & caffeine. I like the portable container ( it can be reused to hold round tea bags). A really well done mint!"
1,Tastes like Medicine!!!,"So I bought this b/c of all the good reviews... I guess I'm the only one that finds this product horrible. It tastes like medicine to me... very ""chalky"" tasting. I tried it the 1st time and wanted to throw up from it... then i decided to try it again just to see if my opinion would change... again i felt like vomitting... I'm a green tea fan but this is just plain nasty!"
3,"Good metal, but not Vio-lence...","Overall, ""Nothing to Gain"" is a decent metal album... Having said that, however, it is NOT what folks expect from VIO-LENCE. The thrash is simply gone for the most part. I recommend this album for the straight-ahead Heavy Metal person, but not the one who enjoys the classic ""thrash"" sound, like me. And don't pay what people are asking for... I picked mine up for $9."
3,Pure thash aggression,To my knowlege this is their last album together as Vio-lence. I like the Oppressing the Masses album much better. This one diden't have as much melodies as the previous two. Twelve gauge justice and Virtues of vice are just as good as anything of their previous work. If you like Vio-lence your still be into this one.
1,Don't Bother.,"Had good hopes for this one... but was really dissapointed!I am a huge Dita fan, and really... I do not know what she was thinking when she decided on this one. Bad acting, not enough Dita doing what she does best, it was just plain strange. If you want to see Dita on film, any other will be a better choice. Unless you're into long scenes of drug use, Long scenes of Dita talking on cellphones in the back of a car, and other nonsense... Trust me, you don't need this one. Go find Andrew Blake's ""Pinups 2"" and have fun with that!"
2,Dissapointed,From the write up I expected it to be more graphic. It was not. This is definitely a movie that you have to watch while tripping. It was disconnected and mind bending and i didn't see enough of Dita Von Teese.
1,Dictionary for every problem experienced by a gay person,"Script touched on every issue know to the world of gay people. Felt like I was re-experiencing my adolescence and coming out...I thought it was trite and would never recommend, except for those who like the torture."
1,What?! No Samples?!,I think what would help sell this is sample audio excerpts. Once bought it can't be returned if it's an assault on the ears.
2,too confusing,"This book started great like the first two of the series. However, midway through the book the plot just got horribly convoluted and made no sense whatsoever. Or maybe it wasn't the plot but the author's rather haphazard way of writing. It seems as though the author took his time the first third of the book, but the rest was just written with no thought as to explaining things so the reader could follow what was going on and why the characters were doing what they were doing. Very, very dissapointing, especially since the first two books were so good. Let's hope things pick up with book 4."
1,Whoops?,I had accidentally bought this thinking it was the clan GAME book like it had been advertised as. My bad. >_<
1,Lack of implied merchantability,Every page was delaminated and held together with one piece of scotchtape. This was not disclosed - at least that I understood from the description. Products of this age should either be sold in better condition or actually restored. I was quite disappointed.
1,Not what I expected,"This book gives a story about a bride & her friends on her big day. It gives a few helpful tips but is more focused on the story than pictures of wonderful ""impact making"" hair do's. There are very few pictures and no real person would be caught dead wearing the styles that are shown. I really hoped this book would give me some great ideas, I guess I expected that from the title, what a diappointment!"
3,Kind Of Misleading...,"When I first saw the title ""Big Day Hair"" I assumed it would be great day hairstyles to wear to work, school etc just as ""Big Date Hair"" had great hairstyles for parties, going out with friends and the like. Also, the book cover pictured here is very misleading and not at all like the one I was sent. Rather, ""Big Day Hair"" is a bridal hair book packed with glossies of several different bridal styles to choose from. That said, if you tone down some of the styles, you could wear them to the office or biology class. A must-own for brides/bridesmaids and fans of Charles Worthington's pervious two hairbooks. A must pass for everyone else."
4,The way to a man's heart is through his stomach,"Back Cover description: ""Don't think you can come sneaking back here if you are ever out of a job!"" Florina's father was furious when, after a lifetime of drudgery, she finally plucked up the courage to rebel. But there was no danger of her returning home. Florina loved her new job as cook in the household of eminent consultant William Sedley. And it wasn't long before she realized that she loved her employer, too. But she had no chance of attracting his attention when he was engaged to be married to the glamorous Wanda!I liked this for the nice pacing of the story. Florina's character wasn't wimpy, just loyal. The buildup of the attraction between her and William was nicely paced. I did think the ending was slightly rushed, but all in all this was one of the better stories the author has written. Too bad Ms. Neels didn't include some recipes in this one."
3,Not for the true beginner...,This book will help those who already play another instrument (specifically the piano) or know the basics of music theory. But if you are a true beginner this book will not make it easy to start up. It's more of a practice book for improving chops.
4,A highly in-depth English grammar,"I own the second edition of this book. Simply put, if you are comfortable with the interpolation of linguistic concepts and transformational-generative grammar with traditional English grammar, then this is definitely the book for you. If, however, you either disdain the relegation of traditional grammatical terminology in favor of the transformational type, or simply feel that the two grammars should be kept separate, then I fear that you will find this book confusing, at best, or downright irritating."
2,don't try to learn English grammar from this,"I was very disappointed. I expected a readable, well-organized explanation of the rules of English grammar and punctuation that would also function as a reference. Instead, I found it to be rather poorly explained, hard to follow, and focused on issues I didn't care about. The book is basically descriptive grammar, which tries (as I understand it) to deduce the rules of the language rather than state them. I just want to know what I should or should not do, or when there's disagreement I want that stated. Complicated terminology was used and then later introduced. The sentence diagramming tended to confuse me rather than help.You're a lot better off with a good style guide. I recommend the New York Public Library Guide to Style and Usage. You can read it from cover to cover if you have the time, and everything is very clearly and systematically explained."
3,This book was an action pack thriller with many twist.,"Death Walk was a great book. There was action from cover tocover. The book grabs the reader's attention at the begining and runs from there. I could not stop reading from the time that I opened it. At times it seems like there is no way out for Jo and Mike. From the time where they were traped in the calve with no way out to Jo lost in the middle of a snow storm. Jo has more heart than anyone that I have ever met. Some of the things that he went though I would not have enough determination to attempt. He also over came many of his fears that helped him in the long run. Blacky and Fawn are wolves that come into play in manysituations. I recommend this book to anyone that wants to read a easy, instersting book that will keep you on the edge of your seat. Any ages from 12 and up can read this book. Everything follows smooth and is easy to keep up with. I enjoyed reading this book and suggest that you give it a shot too."
4,death walk,"Death Walk is a great book! I really enjoyed reading it! It's about a boy named Joel who is trying to survive in Alaska with a man named Mike who is a fugitive,but what makes this story great is that he is on the run from murderers!"
2,"Captures young readers, but asks one to accept too much.","Death Walk is a title which captures the interest of young readers. Joel (Joe) is left alone in the Alaska wilderness and must rely on Mike Donovan to teach him how not only to survive, but to face the life from which Joe is running away. Joe is forced to save his own life while being pursued by the evil Hank and the half-wit Emmett.The action and the situation captive the inexperienced reader and appeals to basic Romantic notions. For anyone beyond this level, the book asks for the reader to accept far too much in the opening premise and in the actions of Joe. It is a young boy's fantasy, but not believable as a story."
5,My Winnipeg,It is a surreal look at a the director's image of Winnipeg. It is a strange mix of real and should-be-real stories about Winnipeg. It is a truly unique film
4,A Fine Film,This is a very entertaining look back at the filmmaker's snowy childhood in Winnipeg - the weather is enough to make you want to move to Florida but the film is quite enjoyable - one of his best.
2,"Interesting concept, flawed execution","Like the hit documentary of 2008, Man On Wire, this is a documentary about dreams. But unlike Man On Wire it doesn't tell a tale of grand dreams, but of simple introspection--dreams of a time bygone. The director calls it a ""docu-fantasia"" and uses a lot of creative gimmicks such as having his mother play herself in reenactments, shooting in black and white, narrating and cutting the entire documentary in a stream of consciousness arthouse film style. All of these stylistic notions are interesting in their concept yet ultimately fail to engage or entertain for the entire length of a film. Maddin's love for his hometown hockey teams and torn down structures that he felt defined his town is apparent. However he failed to make me empathize with that connection, which left for a mostly unengaging film experience."
1,Hiking Journal?,"This is a joke for the money. Cheaper to go out and buy a copy book at the dollar store. For $14.85 + you should get the cover that goes over it. Not worth the money, don't buy it!"
2,Time not Accurate,I had ordered this clock and loved it and then ordered two more and the new ones and the old ones pluged in next to each other keep different time!I thought the idea of the clock was to know you always had the correct time?
2,Difficult to turn alarm off,"This clock does everything it claims to do, but it is impossible to find the alarm on/off switch in the dark. So, if you need to to awaken early while your partner sleeps in longer, this is not the alarm clock for you. If you sleep alone and can turn on a lamp to find the alarm off button, it might work just fine for you."
2,A Chore to Get Through...,"This is true even of the 1936 version...This book simply couldint keep my attention! I had to force myself to finish it, or else I'd have felt I had wasted the [money} paid to get it! Only get it to complete youre collection of Applewoods...Don't put youreself through this ""adventure""..."
2,Stupid Dog,This book was ok. However it was the introduction of Togo. This stupid dog was a total distraction to the mystery from here on in any book that the animal was in. The book was boring throughout until the end when it actually got quite better. It was not the worst of the set but ranks a bit below average.
4,"Okay, original idea","Nancy is asked to solve a mystery pertaining to rare books that were stolen. As she progresses on the case she ends up in another mystery about a whispering statue, that won't whistle anymore. She starts to work for a person she has under suspcion and tries to uncover clues without getting caught. Can she solve the mystery?This one was actually pretty interesting. I liked how Nancy actually worked for who she thought was a suspect. That's some guts she's got there. The whispering stature idea was pretty original, I would have never thought up of one like that. This one was one of her more creative ones. Also I liked that Bess and George were in this one because they always seem to make it more exciting.I reccomned this book to someone who wants to enjoy a good mystery of Nancy Drew."
4,"Superb Plot, The Whispering Statue is.","Very good book in the way of how the statue whispers. But does the wind make it whisper, if it's specially designed to talk certain stuff when the wind comes? Because of the holes, probably something like that. I also think this book is nice because of the store that Nancy (Debbie Lynbrook) works in. I like books of all type, and the other stuff seemed interesting. I always go in every bookstore I see. Otherwise, I liked the captures, the criminal gang encounters, and most of that stuff. So if you like 4-star action, think about this book. You'll surely like it."
3,disappointed,"When I received the Nancy Drew book, The Whispering Statue,I was a little disappointed. Since the book had been rated as ""very good"" I had expected that ""very good"" meant that it had a dust jacket on it. The book itself was indeed in very good shape, however, very good means to me that every aspect of the book is in tact and in good shape including the dust jacket. It would have been nice if this book seller had noted that the dust jacket was missing, other sellers do note this information."
3,Weak Entry in the Drew Series,Carolyn Keene's tale of a crooked art dealer suffers from the villain being identified too early and an implausible plot. For hardcore Drew fans only.
3,Review of the 1970s revised edition.,"I had the 1970s revised edition-- apparently a nearly total redo of the original 1937 book. No Togo, no jewel thieves. I believe that I have read the original at some point (I first read my aunt's editions of these books) since I actually remember a plot that seems like the description of the original book.The revised version of The Whispering Statue isn't one of the best Nancy Drew books. The plot is a little bit scattershot, although I do like the bit with Nancy's secret identity. Boys, sailing, adventure and stolen art are the themes of the day in this series entry."
3,Interesting,"In a war torn world, a martal art called ""Shadow Skill"" exists, and you must fight to survive. Although interesting, pretty boring characters and a very hard-to-follow story line with several plot holes (I'm not kidding, and I fully understood ""Akira""). However, the bit of story line that does make sense is pretty good, and the fight sequences are excellent."
3,a bit far out but entertaining,"If you are new to anime and want to see an entertaing movie with a not so in depth plot, than Shadow Skill is for you. While a bit over the top at times with martial art scenes, people will most likely be drawn into this flick mainly for the purpose of discovering what the shadow skill really is. Though Shadow Skill is targeted at kids, teens and young adults who are into anime may want to give this a look."
1,Awful picture,"The mosquito noise dots actually seem to be part of the staging, caused by a fine gauze screen at the front of the stage. This is often used in stage productions for light diffusion (Glyndebourne Tristan, Munich & Hamburg Poulenc), but rarely throughout a whole opera. The dots are eye-catching when performers are filmed in close-up. This isn't HD-conform."
4,"good little book, wide variety of vocab","I bought this book for my sister when she entered first-year Russian, to go along with herOxford Russian Dictionary. I've taken a few years of Russian myself, and what I like about this book is the way you can flip through and pick up new vocabulary on the go. I've also found it's available at a variety of big-box bookstores. It's small type but the print is clean and the book feels nice. If you're looking for something to build vocabulary, this is a solid and compact choice -- it had new words for my sister in her first year, and me in my third year alike!"
3,"Nifty book, but where are the accent marks?",This is a handy little book and well worth the small price. I just wish it had the accents marked on the russian words rather than their transliterations.
4,"What is this? Baby-sitters, Nurses on Call?!?","I checked this book out from the library, and was disappointed. There were no sitting jobs, period. They turned from baby-sitting to nursing. What are they, Baby-sitters, Nurses on Call? The baby-sitters should NOT be nurses, they should just be regular, plain-old baby-sitters. They should NOT be turned into the Nurses on Call Club, just the Baby-sitters Club."
3,Don't give me any lip!,"This is a nice product, but, the lip on the edge prevented me from being able to use it for its intended purpose."
5,Every Kitchen Could Use thi Turntable!,"I LOVE this turntable.I bought another one that stacked. Now, my spices are so easy to use when I cook."
5,A Classic Legend in its Original form,"Though the story of Tristan and Iseult predates even this particular telling of the story, it is the earliest extant version we have, and it suffers not at all from its age. Full of love, battle, humor (and there are some great points of humor in the book), and a visit from Aruthur's knights, this is a classic tale of romance and betrayal. Any fan of Arthurian myth should read this timeless tale that has inspired so many to write books, music, and poetry. Even before there was the story of Romeo and Juliet, there was this story of star crossed lovers."
5,Un-BO-lievable!,"This book is BO-dacious! It's full of stories and facts about everyone's favorite superstar ""BO"" Jackson. This book is perfect for anyone suffering from Bo-Mania... I know I am! My favorite chapter? Bo-Lieve it or not! This may very well be the best book ever written.The Amazing Bo Jackson is a modern classic.Randi Hacker should win a freaking nobel prize... Seriously, Bo Jackson is a God worthy of mass worship and devotion. Randi Hacker is a prophet. I find it sacraligous that despite such landmark novels as, ""What Every Teenager Wants to Know About Sex: With Startling New Information Every Parent Should Read"", ""Totally Amazing Dinosaurs (Full-Color Activity Book)"" and, ""Pony Pals Cookbook"" Randi Hacker has still not been awarded a Pulitzer or Nobel Prize."
1,Broke after maybe 6 uses( less than 2 months),"First off, this mat slips. Whenever I tried to roll my fondant it slipped a little. Second, to roll it back is a little hard since is so heavy, it opens up so u have to find a good space for it. Third, sadly after maybe 6 uses under 2 months it broke in two of the corners. I was cleaning it and pulled it so i can clean underneath and the corners fell apart in my hands. The price is not high, but for this piece of crap it is indeed a lot. Hope I can help someone with my review. Take care."
5,AMAZING!,I cannot say enough wonderful things about this mat! Nothing sticks to it! No more struggling with sticking fondant. I wish I had this mat a looong time ago! Made my cake jobs such a breeze. I am in LOVE with this mat!
1,"Doesn't Lay Flat, Too Heavy","I was SO excited to got this mat, mostly for using with fondant. Much to my dismay, when it arrived, it wouldn't lay flat. No matter what I did, there was a HUGE wave in it. Maybe I just got a bad one, but there is NO WAY I could have used this for fondant. Also, it is very heavy. I would be very nervous putting the weight of this on my cake when transferring the fondant. I immediately returned it, and ended up purchasing THE Mat (if you know which product I'm referring to), and it is AMAZING!!! I am so glad I did not keep this mat, as I get fabulous results with the one I ended up purchasing instead."
2,SAD,"I bought the book from the Uzbek embassy abroad.I have read most of our president's books and take a very serious interest in issues facing Uzbekistan. Unfortunately,I found the book to be rather unrealistic and more politicaly motivated for supporting his candidicy.The hopes and intentions have all only appeared on his many diffirent books which only strenghtens his foregin understanding and does not reflect the state of the republic."
4,A Book by the President,This is an interesting book that provides an overview of the development strategy for Uzbekistan by the leadership of the country. Worth reading if you want to know what is really going in the political and economic spheres of life in Uzbekistan
3,Marathon read,"Part 1 with the demise of the bugs was drawn out too long for my taste, however I did enjoy it.Part 2, brought back similarities to our history, obviously had input from some one who had seen combat. I related to the ""Rebel's"", saw analogies with our past history, reinforcing that war does not prove who is right, only who is leftThoroughly enjoyable reading for my partScored it a 3 overall, due to the 1st part as commented.Weber & White do work well together"
2,50-50 so far,"I purchased 2 of these bottles to store flavored Grape Seed Oils.They looked perfect for the job.I filled each bottle with (room temperature) oil and left them on the kitchen table.About 6 hours later I hear a ""crash"" in the kitchen and find 1 of the bottles has shattered spilling about a liter of oil over the table, a couple of chairs, and the floor.A huge mess to clean up.Amazon was quick to process a refund of the broken bottle. Yeah Amazon!But I'm not currently willing to trust the 2nd bottle further."
1,Dont be fooled by the name Motorola,I have had this phone for 6 months and it works -but the battery life is not good. The phones are now to the point that the battery life is very short. I expected much more with a product made by Motorola. I tossed my sony wireless for this one and wish I had not.
1,HORRIBLE Battery life,"Fresh out of the box, the NiCD batteries can only support about two hours of talk time. That means that if you have home office, you have to charge it at least once during the day or rotate handsets. Talk about a pain in the @**. As such, this design is a failure. F-."
1,"Reasonable features, dreadful audio","This phone has a reasonable set of features, and a good, compact form factor. Unfortunately the headset turns out to be uncomfortable and unwieldly to use, and more importantly the sound quality is appaling. It is frequently difficult to hear the other party at all: there is almost constant interference (the main reason for opting for a 5.8GHz phone is not to get interference -- note also that I've used this set in two separate locations with the same results), the volume is too low, and even on maximum the hands-free remains almost inaudible.Avoid."
3,"ok, but don't use w/ VOIP","This phone worked very well on my analog line, BUT then I connected it to my Sunrocket VOIP.... After talking to Motorola, they confirmed that there are known problems with this phone not ringing with an incoming call when used with an Internet VOIP such as Sunrocket, Vonage, etc...Thanks to Amazon for taking it back w/ no questions asked."
1,Misleading,"I purchased the item with the base with the answering machine. I have always trusted and used Motorola telephones. because I only have one phone jack, I bought the expandable system, as they usually do NOT require a phone jack. I have no phone for my bedroom now, and because of my trust, MOST of the packaging is somewhere in my new home. So I cannot return it. It should have said that another outlet was required for the expandable phones."
2,WARNING - Phone not compatible with cable phone service,"These phones worked fine for us until we changed our phone service to a cable company - serviced phone line. I am no techy, so I don't know exactly what the problem was, but the phones WILL NOT RING. They recognize the incoming call, the phone lights up and the caller ID works, but no ring.We spent almost an hour on the phone with Motorola and they finally concluded that the phone just would not ring with this phone service.We are returning the phones and seeking another brand that is compatible."
1,finally returned to store,Terrible reception (bought from Best Buy for $94...much higher than Amazon). Worked with Motorola CS with no positive results. Replacing with Uniden 5.4 (already have several and should not have deviated from a known).
1,It just doesn't work right,This phone has design flaws known to Motorola. Moto wanted to send me a new one which actually worked. I will go with another brand.
5,An astonishing and captivating story,"From the moment I began reading, I couldn't put it down. The plot was so well written, the journey of these random digits seemed daunting. I was afraid for 238756, after that heart wrenching scene with 98554. I wondered how innocent 19072 would handle the situation. The climax of the book was unexpected, with 98765323465. I had been rooting for 53847239 all that time, but OH. I'm so sorry for the spoiler! At the end, it was a very happy tale. I was glad they all made it out, and learned some important lessons as well. The only thing I didn't like about this book were the spelling errors."
2,What is the square root of John Galt?,"I'm sorry to be one of the constant readers disappointed with the volume. Unfortunately, it is rather like a rehash of Atlas Shrugged or The Fountainhead, only slightly less tiresome and preachy. For ardent RANDists only."
3,Wait for the audiobook version,"While the printed version is good, I would have expected the publisher to have an audiobook version as well. A perfect companion for one's Ipod."
1,Not Nearly A Million,"This book does not even come close to delivering on its promise of one million random digits. My expectations were high after reading the first sentence, which contained ten unique digits. However, the author seems to have exhasted his creativity in this initial burst, because the other 99.999% of the book is filler in which those same ten digits are shamelessly reused!If you are looking for a larger offering of numerals in various bases, I highly recommend ""Peter Rabbit's ABC and 123""."
4,Kanzashi Tutorial - How to Make an Unusual Kanzashi Flower,Have just completed my first Kanzashi Flower. Following Ivanna's instructions was so easy. The little tips were a great help to get a fantastic result.
2,A flawed metaphysical conceit,"This should have been a better read, given the enthusiastic newspaper reviews. The author's intended critique of the Bush/Blair War on Terror is too obvious and clunking, especially when expressed through the metaphysical conceit of a toilet brush and a flea waltzing in a darkened motel room.Matters improve once the Archduke is introduced in chapter 79, until the exploding cat litter incident reveals him to be an unreliable narrator. This cruel trick completely undermines the reader's sympathy built up in the section, written entirely in iambic heptameter, where he learns of his half-brother's Sapphic tendencies.Finally, the over-zealous use of the number 9 spoils an otherwise perfectly serviceable dénouement."
5,The Ice Gorilla,"The Ice GorillaCouldn't put this book down, no wonder it's a best seller. Definitely a brain freezer til the end :)Great read- Frostbite is the least of Dr. Will Freeman's worry in this epic, icy tale!I survived The Ice Gorilla....Will You????"
5,Where Is My Son? by: JohnDalglish,"This book is a must read! Great plot, realistic charcterization,smooth development of the mult-layered themes such as human greed, loss of a child, adoption, black markets, how depression can inhibit the desire to live, how ordinary people can become detached from reality due to bad things beyond their control.Be alert: the author respecfully named the 'boy' who is the focus of the story after the designer of the cover. A compassionate book, but honest in the underlying ills of society. I neglected chores and yard work to read this book in its entirity! I look forward to more books by John Dalglish![ASIN:1470098725 Where's My Son?]]"
5,America's Financial Reckoning Day/Charles H.Coppes,"I read with great interest this book by Charles Coppes. I have recommended it to all family,friends,and business associates! It covers very topical issues such as the Federal Reserve System,and Central Banking,the coming Fiscal Bankruptcy and collapse of the American empire,Political Paradigms,and prophetic implications. MOST importantly, Personal and Financial Implications one needs to consider,and put in place to protect ones' wealth,and family.It is very well laid out,easy to understand,and URGENTLY important to understand the implications for ALL of us,no matter which country we live in.I was,as are most still, very ignorant of the role the U.S.Federal Reserve has played,and does play in the worlds' Fiat Money system.PLEASE! PLEASE! PLEASE! read this book. It could save your life!"
2,"IRobot batteries, Series 400","Am not having good luck with the batteries I've received...in 2010 I rec'd one from Bedford Power and it lasted less than 6 months. I just rec'd one from Power Plus and it arrived dead after 2 many hour attempts to charge it. I've contacted them for a refund. I would like to get batteries that last at least a year, because they are expensive. I do not think these 2 companies are the best source of supply. I do not use my robot only about every 2 or 3 weeks...because not much rug traffic, so its not from overuse and I leave the charger on 100% of the time."
1,Products are not what they seem,Both the products I ordered were not what I really wanted dont want to pay to ship back
1,Terrible....,had problems with the kindle and the support was the worst in the world... terrible do not get a kindle buy nook
3,"Its strengths are also its weaknesses, yet utterly unpredictable!","I found this book to be a real page turner, I really didn't know what was coming next, but after a while the unpredictability became a detriment. I knew EXACTLY what would happen next (another unpredictable event)! I even guessed exactly what event would happen almost 10% of the time, I'm sure I could do even better if I kept at it (and actually achieve 10%)!So, I tired of the unpredictability, who could've guessed that?You might like this other book. If you have a keen eye for detail, you might even KNOW what is going to happen next, but I still bet that you will be surprised by the ending!Pi to One Hundred Thousand Places"
5,The Choosing by Andrea Myers,"With the masterful writing of Rabbi Myers to quote from her last lines ""labels fade .... The stories take center stage."" This story of Rabbi Meyers' journey through her life and to her Jewish calling is magically woven with text from many sources. This is a story which must be read by anyone who reflects on his or her life, it's meaning and how to be happy. Also it is a story which will resonate with anyone who has given any thought to his or her own identity, whether it is religious, spiritual, position in family or world or sexual orientation. Rabbi Meyers' draws you into her story and compels you the reader to think of your own. I was moved to thought, introspection and great smiles.Thank you.Donna Cephas"
1,THE CLAIMING OF SLEEPING BEAUTY,"This book was listed as ""If you liked 50 Shades of Grey, you'll love The Sleeping Beauty Trilogy"". Well I really enjoyed 50 Shades of Grey, but this book was anything but enjoyable. It was disgusting and degrading and didn't even make it past the second chapter. I couldn't return it fast enough. Don't waste your time or your money. Wish I could have rated it zero stars."
5,eldohr adventures by T L Wood,I have bought several copies of T L Wood book of Eldohr Adventures to give to my friends and family. I truly enjoyed it. I was so involved in the story I could not put it down. Everyone I gave it to really enjoyed it to. So nice to have a book with clean language and no hackum up violence in it. It was a joy to read for people of all ages and I can hardly for the next one to come out. Keep up the good work. Thank you C K S
5,The Wild Life by John Lewis Stempel,What a story! Beautifully written and thought provoking. The experiences described stand out clear and true even including the author's own family. I own one of the first hard covers (now also availabel in paperback)and gave it a favorite place on my bookshelf. Highly recommended reading for any nature loving reader.
2,A symptom of our time.,"This book is a brave effort but is neverthelesssymptomatic of the state of literature in the21st century. How far we have fallen since theera of Tolstoy and Dostoevsky!Evidently the author is a structuralist who hasseen ""Last Year in Marienbad"" a few too manytimes and gone off the deep end. One is soonstruck by the author's prolixity and extremely minimal vocabulary. The plot is so fragmented and pointillistic that one begins to feel they could start anywhere and read in either direction or upside down and the novel would make as much or as little sense.The title of the appendix is an oxymoron and one is left to wonder if this was an attempt at humor, or simple ineptness. A tale told by an idiot, full of sound and fury, signifying nothing."
3,Useful in a pinch but I lost my place in the book,"I got this book for Hanukkah last year and it was really helpful for a few months. It was a great reference when you needed a random number for all your daily tasks. Of course it's great for the standard find a random TV or AM radio channel. But, it has even proved difficult with my home plumbing repairs. When I had to replace my frozen pipes I had no idea how many turns I needed to tighten the faucet nut, turns out it was 5621 turns.Things were good for a long while, but then I lost my place, and I cannot find it again for the life of me. I have been searching for 23 weeks now and have even used a second copy of this book to help randomly find my page number. No such luck. I recommend using a bookmark when reading or referencing."
1,Disappointing,"First I should probably clarify that I have a bit of a finger fetish. So I'm sure you can imagine my delight when Amazon recommended that I might be interested in this title. I quickly clicked ""buy it now"" and even paid the extra $3.99 for one day shipping. I raced home from work, turned down the lights, turned on the Barry White, poured myself a glass of chardonnay, ripped open the book, and saw a million random....numbers. I was hoping to be turned on by a million new and exciting random strangers, but just got a bunch of numbers. Big disappointment."
1,What a botch!!,"I wish I could give this book zero stars. I know that if I had had anything to do with the creation of this disaster, I would've killed myself.The plot is middling, and the comparisons that are made between Senator Alfonse Demato and the English muffin are simply uncalled for.It seems I am in the minority, though, as they are already planning a sequel."
3,A random rating,"I read randomly selected portions of this book, using randomly selcted numbers to determine it, and I can confidently say: If you liked Finnegan's Wake, you'll love this."
4,Didn't like the ending,"Even though I didn't really see it coming, the ending was kind of anti-climatic. But overall the book held my attention and I really liked the ""10034 56429 234088"" part. It's nice to know I'm not the only one who feels that way."
1,Wont someone think of the children?,"I cannot believe that a good company like Amazon would promote such an item! This is going to end up on Bill O'Reilly one day. Seriously, promoting ""Deviants"" as ""normal"" just encourages our children to rebel against the authority of their parents and that of our lord and savior. Deviants are abnormal, and we should send all 100,000 of the deviants to church camp and get their souls clean.I'm ashamed to be an American today."
3,Waiting for the movie,"I really enjoyed this book when I first recieved it...however, after having put it down over a long weekend, I found it difficult to pick up again. On a couple of occasions I had to go back to an area that I had previously read to refresh my mind on who one or more of the characters were. I believe that it will translate very well to the big screen. In fact I have a friend who is a screenwriter and says that he could easily turn this into an Oscar worthy film, so I will just wait until this appears in my local theatre to enjoy the convoluted plot twists and colorful characters."
3,Devil in the Details,"This book should clearly be classified as absurdist literature similar to that of Thomas Beckett. Anyone who takes this work literally is really missing the larger interpretive point. I do, however, wish the author would have left the religious overtones out of the story. I felt Rand became a little preachy, especially toward the end when 275095 was divided into 19. I mean really... that's just cruel and was obviously written purely for shock value.I hear there is a sequel in the works. I would really like to see this story told from the point of view of one of the outcast deviants that were not normal such as 89632051. The tricks and fun had the expense of 89632051 enraged me. I was always curious as to what was going through his head. The author briefly described his thoughts as ""654843 3216672 159431.""I've also heard rumors that the entire text is a recipe for deviled eggs if read backwards. I'm going to try it out as soon as I get home from work."
1,TOO S L O W,"Watch purchased on Nov 16 will not be shipped until Nov 23 and the estimated arrival date is Dec 2-8. Order status claims the ship date was revealed before order was finalized - must have been in the small print. This order will arrive way too late for its intended purposes and will make me reconsider any future purchases from Amazon. A 15lb order from another online retailer ordered the same day is expected to arrive on Nov 20th and it is being shipped via the ""free shipping"" option. Why the big delay Amazon?"
4,The Panther,"Norman DeMille is to be congratuated on two fronts: 1. He is a fine story teller. 2. Even more impressive is the way he interweaves the culture, the history, the political environment of a country, in to his story. In this instance, he depicts Yemen, a yet-to-be-known country with a terrifying background, where back-stabbing is a norm and virtually no one is trusted. A most compelling history lesson."
5,Searching for truth with a broken flashlight,"Outstanding book on the Evolution/Creation topic. Exposes the false and pejorative auguments of intellegent design folks. Mike Hawley really has done his research on religious doctrine and its roots. There is indeed room for science for most Christian church denominations, at least 77 percent of them."
4,Other reviewers are missing the point,"It is the sequence of the numbers, not the numbers themselves, that make this book such a brilliant accomplishment.However, we should all be concerned about the fact that these particular number sequences are now all ""copyrighted material"". Rand has taken all the really excellent random sequences for themselves!For example, the stunning randominity of row 145's ""00023 12302"", and of course the mind-bending random rebound from 18619 to 13674 back to 18611 in row 140. Stunning, yes...but now the coyprighted property of Rand."
1,Lacks critical indexing,"While this is an excellent compilation of randomized decimal digits, it lacks a proper Index. I cannot find some of my old favorites like ""94682"", ""76047"", ""35247"" or ""67818"". The best solution for this is to have this in a searchable digital form (likeA Million Random Digits THE SEQUEL: with Perfectly Uniform Distribution-- in Kindle! Though, sadly, this collection is admittedly pseudorandom).This book also needs translation into hexadecimal and binary (as mentioned by other reviewers). Finally, the 100,000 normal deviates, while considered deviates in 2001 when this was first published, are now referred to by enlightened mathematicians with more precise and less pejorative terms, and viewed simply as a part of the rich fabric of randomness in the infinity of number sets."
1,Yeah this thing is a load of crap,"I only counted 999,999 digits in the book, and I seriously saw the pattern 12353 like seven times, that doesn't sound very random to me."
1,Not deviant,"Although the title promises 100,000 deviants, you are better off reading the book by Alex Thio or the one by Katharine Gates. Too much ""normal"", not enough ""deviant."""
2,Too Great A Departure From The Canon,"Apparently the authors of this book did not bother to view the first season of Star Trek before penning their insult. If they had, they would have recognized that Yeoman Janice never showed any mathematical (or writing) talent whatsoever, and certainly would have taken a different slant with their faux autobiography of the hapless crew-woman. I find it difficult to believe that Paramount approved this manuscript prior to publication.I would have given it only one star, but there's a lot of 69 in the book and that's worth a star by itself."
3,Risky Shot by Kathleen Brooks,"Shock ending for this second book in the series was a source of dismay. Although the book had engaging characters and story line carried from the first book, the development of the main characters is lacking this time around. I just can't get over the book ending with the main character in peril and the story line unresolved. I guess you HAVE TO read the next book to get your money's worth."
2,I Was Told There Would Be No Math Involved or Is Threre?,"Where are those little 'textie' thingies you're suppossed to use to do stuff like add and subtract the numbers and the higher math like multiplication and division? One more word, Rainman. He work's cheap."
1,Trade in = SCAM,"I have tried to return several items now. All have been returned. Amazon makes it look easy to return items. Its true they will offer you the most money for your trade-ins, but when the trade in items are received they are always down graded..., or they tell you it's the wrong item. For example I typed in the isbn number for a book I wanted to return, Amazon did the search and pulled up the item and now I receive and E-mail telling me it's the wrong item. Tell me how it's the wrong item when I pull it up from the web-site??? I won't waste my time with amazon again. Shoping or trading items in. Amazon deals are not as good as they used to be. This is a long process too. I have been waiting for over 2 weeks for this last return to be sent back. The only acceptable part of this transaction is I didn't have to pay for shipping."
1,Payment information,"I tried to buy four items from Amazon for a college course that I am taking. I ordered them two weeks in advance. A few days later, two of the items came in. When I found out that the rest of the order hadn't shipped because of my credit card being denied, I called Amazon. After we discussed it for a while, the customer service rep told me that the payment went through and the items would be shipped. Since I was running out of time to get my order, I really needed him to be telling the truth. My credit card had plenty of funds, but the billing address was wrong. I changed it over the phone, so everything should have been ok, as the customer service rep expressed. The next day it still hadn't sent, so I had to spend a few hours on the phone with Amazon yet again. At this point, I have two days before I need the order and it won't ship until tomorrow. It has already affected my grade. This was an awful experience."
2,excellent customer service,"I purchased a puppy training gadget, had a couple of problems with it, but the customer service was great! I am very happy with Amazon!"
4,quick shipping,"(""Thanks very much for your great service I will think about your stores when I need books again"") to Jordan AndersonJAA Store"
2,Too unpredictable,"The book is too hard to follow, the author randomly shifts from one number to another without any prior warning."
2,unsorted,The random numbers in this book are not sorted. It would be much easier to find the numbers you were looking for if the numbers appearing in the book in numerical order.
3,Shuffle ... it rocks!!!!,I recently entered this book into my iPod ... it was a great idea since I made a trip from Argentina to China. I used the shuffle option and it was like heaven!! I did not feel the trip at all ... I recommend that you do the same. Shuffle rocks!!!
3,The greatest book ever writen,"I would just like to agree with the above comments made by whoever that was. The search for Truly random numbers is seconded only by the search for the holy grail.Which reminds me of that other great peice of work. I think It was called the bible or something like that. Which had a great intro though there are no author's comments or acknowledgements so I'm unsure of who to credit such work to. I say credit, what I mean is to insult. The characters were wooden, the plot was hackneyed and at times became a little far fetched, but I came across a section called the Gospel, so it must be true.But, back to my main review. This book share's similar problems. I find it hard to believe that no. ""288564"" is random...it just's so obvious.If you have trouble sleeping on flights then this is definatley the purchase for you."
2,Talkeetna Good Time,"Talkeetna Good Time, Jnuary 05,2010By: Scott Christmas, Las Cruces, NMThe author, Dennis Brown is made of the same stuff this nation's pioneers were. He writes of his life experiences, his family and those individuals that left thier mark on his and his family's lives.Each chapter is a complete short story of different individual's life's challenges and the solutions there of.I look forward to meeting db and his 'fire starter', Carol as well as reading his next book."
3,"For the purists, this translation is just ok...","It always happens when you translate something into the vernacular. Something of the original intent or message gets lost. For the purists out there like myself, you're much better off purchasing A Million Random Digits with 100,000 Normal Deviates by RAND Corporation, Ed. 1 (Paperback - December 25, 1999) in the original Latin.Tell me honestly, which paints more of a picture in your mind:""4789"" or ""MMMMDCCLXXXIX"" or how about ""3762"" or ""MMMDCCLXII""?If you're a purist who enjoys the untouched original like me, then I rest my case.P.S. A Million Random Digits and not a single ""3"" in the entire volume? Please."
3,Weirdest sudoku book ever,"This has got to be the most useless set of sudoku puzzles ever.In my copy of the book, all of the puzzles were already filled in which I find really annoying and what is worse, most of them have been filled in wrongly.I have been through the whole book really carefully and only found seven puzzles that had been filled out correctly! Yes, just seven.Well, making the best of a bad job, I am now going through the book trying to correct all of the faulty puzzles and I will then submit my corrections.Perhaps a second edition will be more useful.I did find last week's winning lottery numbers on page 18 though."
4,Argh !,"I wrote a report on this book last semester . My roommate failed to tell me he had the Cliffs ! Can you believe that ? Thanks , Brad !"
3,Mixed blessing,"Although the plot was appropriately paced and the characterisation inventive, I found it hard to suspend disbelief in a couple of places, and frankly the sex scenes were awkward and clumsily written, adding very little of value to the plot. It's not a bad read, but I'd prefer a Neil Gaiman."
4,The Truth is Out There!,"It wasn't until I got to 43654 and then sped on towards 53511 that I realized that if you take every 10th digit, multiply by 12, divide by 150, then using every 5th digit to code with the letters of the Russian alphabet, that you get a backwards version of the Da Vinci Code! Dan Brown, tell us the truth! Is this your work??"
2,Save your time and watch the movie.,"Book is okay. Seriously, I would recommend that you just see the movie. It was remarkably true to the book and I thought George Clooney's performance as the string of digits on page 34 brought something to the story that you just can't get from the written version."
4,goodly creatures written by a goodly creature,"I loved this book, It had history, romance, ethics and a good ending and some evil characters and many more good characters,with flaws of course. This book made me laugh and cry. It had good character development. I have not read Pride and Preduice so I don't know if that is a requirement for this book but I thoughly enjoyed this read. Thanks Beth."
3,One bad experience,"Hello. I don't want to say that my experience with Amazon was unsatisfying yet I have to because it was. I am a college student so I get my textbooks online, well at least the ones that are not carried in my campus bookstore. Anyways my 1st book was incorrect which was my fault so no lost feelings but I never received my 2nd order. When I contacted the seller he said that, ""his account didn't have enough funds to complete the order"". BOGUS!!! I never received my $ back and I was pissed. Yet I re-ordered the textbook and though it did come, it took over two weeks to get to me.Now I am in the process of hand making myself a phone case, now-a-days the kids are calling it a ""blinged out phone case"". The supplies are really cheap here but I'm afraid to order due to my previous experiences."
1,requium by jamie mcguire,This series is difficult to read because of all the grammatical errors. The simple misuse of words like their instead of they're and multiple typing errors made me put the book down uninterested in finishing. The author should stick to private journaling until she can compose coherent thoughts and the editor should be fired.
5,killing lincoln,I am 70 years old and I have just read Killing Lincoln by Bill O'Reilly. I thought it was one of the best books I have read in years. There is information that up till now I had no idea about. This should be made mandatory reading for all high school kids. The facts are presented and there is no ox to gore.
4,Unauthorized Access,"A great read. Great character development in a backdrop of modern day, high tech savy and suspense. A good pace - both entertaining and grounded."
3,Puzzled,How can a deviate be normal? I'm still perplexed. It appears to be an oxymoron. Otherwise it makes fascinating bed-time reading and is a sure cure for insomnia.
3,Probably brilliant,"This is probably a brilliant book, even though I haven't read it, and certainly never will - thus I have given it an average rating in the hope that things will level out eventually on a cosmic scale.However, several of the review here contained massive spoilers and so I'm quite sure that I can guess the ending, which made me not buy this book which I have been looking forward to read since, well, basically ever!Thanks, really ..."
3,Well y'know.....,"It wasn't a bad book, it did have its good points, but I'd recommend waiting until the movie comes out.I hear rumours that Emilio Estevez is up for the lead"
2,Normal Deviates?,"Since when are deviates normal? Even if there were such a thing as a normal deviate, I doubt seriously that anyone could come up with a 100,000 of them. Oh, wait a minute...I'm thinking of deviants....never mind."
3,Easy Read,"If you're looking for a leisurely read sometime, this is it!The only problems I had with it, (and they were glaring, hence the two-star deduction) were that the concept was fairly cliche and the plot was predictable."
4,Great value--plus a bonus!,"While other reviewers have noted that the orderly printing style, uniform type size and reliance on a single font limit its haphazardness, this volume is still a bargain. Let's face it, in this day and age, no book that offers over 10,000 digits per dollar can be all bad--random or not! The appendix is a real surprise, though. The author brushes aside the seeming paradox and emerges with an incisive, clear-eyed treatment of 100,000 normal deviates, rich with examples.The single disappointment is the introduction, which appears to be entirely in English prose."
2,Great for the lotto player,"I was really in need of some random digits to help me with my Powerball picks. I read a book that said not to use the quickpick, but to fill out the cards, so I bought this to help randomize my selections.Cutting to the chase, I feel ripped off. There are only 999,996 random numbers in the book, not a million as advertised. Somebody please give me 4 more numbers?"
4,"Kevin Niksarli, M.D.'s review of The Eye Care Revolution","The Eye Care Revolution: Prevent and Reverse Common Vision Problems is a very useful and clearly written guidebook for our eyes and vision. The author believes in the fact that, in order to learn more about our eyes, we need to look deeper for the connections between the course of our eye problems and our overall health. He explores the effects of certain disease and drugs, as well as vitamins, supplements and herbs, for many eye conditions.The overall belief is that eyes don't get sick by themselves, and an eye cannot be treated without attending to our overall health.It is a book not to be skipped. Great work indeed."
2,WARNING!!! CREDIT CARD FRAUD!!!,"I have ordered many times from Amazon and always been pleased with the products and the way in which they were delivered. However, I issue this review as a WARNING to others...my credit card information was just lifted from an Amazon on-line purchase!!!! I know the Amazon market-place was the venue from which my information was stolen because I have made no other purchases with my card in a over 1 week, leaving just one theft opportunity.I am currently dealing with my bank regarding a fraud investigation into this matter. The perpetrator charged $322 on my account and attempted a second $150, which the bank flagged and declined. Be VERY, VERY cautious when ordering from Amazon!"
1,SUPER BUMMED; 1st Order with Amazon!!!,"Ordered 2 CDs from Amazon, including new AMy Winehouse; Received today; packaging looks new, all good; But when I insert into CD Player, immediately (song #2) the disc starts skipping, then totally quits playing; Then I reset for song#3, and skipping; try for song #4 and nothing, no sound no nothing. And there is nothing wrong w/my CD player. This is horrible for a company to advertise they ship NEW products and then ship defective merchandise!"
2,Shipping cost,The shipping costs are outageous. I ordered a shaving brush for $8.00 and theshipping cost was $8.95. I won't be ordering anymore from Amazon.
1,Lost Souls,"I'm suprised that this book is so bad. It ends at the halfway point of the story in an obvious effort to get the reader to buy another book to finish the story, and I don't mean that it leaves the door open for a new book - it really ends in the middle of the story! In addition, there are references made by the main characters to the Frankenstein movie - jokes! I understand that this is fiction and requires the suspension of disbelief, but how can one get into a book about current plots by an insane Victor Frankenstein while the characters in the book refer to the Frankenstein movie? As I said, it is really junk. I'm very disappointed and will never buy a Dean Koontz book again. I hate it when someone tries to suck me in as if I was too stupid to understand the game - sell me half an item to make me pay double for the whole thing. Very disappointing."
1,"Yes, Give Them Your Money!","I'm a lifelong Independent with an open mind. This was a one sided piece of tea baggin propoganda. I watched it, thinking it was a documentary on politics. It wasn't but I got through the whole thing. Amazing that people are actually finding this anything but entertaining. What a joke Blackwell is."
1,Garbage right wing propaganda,"I'm glad I didn't buy this DVD I rented it by mistake. If we get a conservative right wing Republicreep president in 2012 we can all kiss our back ends goodbye.Roll back the Reagan tax he sold out the USA he was a myth brought about by the rich who control this country (secret shadow govt.).Americans are ... I hate to say it...are stupid. Some do not learn from the past (1920s 1930s here we come). Americans are glued to the tv and entertainment celebrities. We are being brainwashed. Say goodbye to Social Security, Medicaid, Medicare say goodbye to your rights.You want Obama out (he's not perfect the shadow government owns him too) but get a Republicreep farewell to the Middle Class and ... well the poor get poorer.You brought it on. I'm going to some other country."
1,Garbage in & Garbage out,"This movie, like so much put out by the right wing today, is a what is known as a false flag. It tries to change how history really went down to something they find more palatable. If you look at Federal Economic Policy since the time before the Great Depression through today's Great Recession you will see that times of economic growth are triggered by Policies put forth under Democratic Presidents and the bubbles inflate and crash during the times of Republican Presidents.You should never believe anything that Andrew Breitbart says or releases. He edits away anything that does not support his vision and the vision of his masters, the Koch Brothers. Every one of his gotcha videos has been proven to be not based in what we call reality."
2,Rust on many pieces,I bought 2 sets of this nice heavy flatwear for our cottage. Used once and put in dishwasher. Knives had many rust spots after one use. Some forks also effected. There also appears to be a lot of streaking and spots from water which I did not see on the old set. When I return home to a Kohls store I am returning all!!
5,Flatware set,"I've had this set for over a year, and its very heavy and its oversized. The soup spoons are almost the size of serving spoons. I love it. Its standing up very well."
1,Rust appeared on 80% of pieces after being soaked in water for a few hours,"After receiving the goods, I soaked the flatware in water to clean them. After a few hours, rust covered spots on many pieces. All forks were affected. Spoons on the other hand had fewer such occurences. Overall 80% of the pieces were deemed defective. Very disappointing."
1,a piece of trash,"This brush not only broke the 1st time I used it, it got stuck in the pellet stove pipe I was cleaning and caused me hours more work to get it out. I strongly recommend to stir clear of this item. I am in the process of getting customer service from the company to answer my emails with no luck. Save your self the headache."
1,unhappy customer,"this was my first time ordering this product and similar products. This was to be a gift for my japanese candy enthusiast little sister. the product description read ""soft chewy candy"" however when I received it, they were all hard as a rock. Being that everything on the packaging in written in Japanese I am not able to locate the expiration date or read it for that matter. I'm not sure if they are stale and old or if they became hard due to the weather conditions but either way I am unsatisfied with my purchase and will no longer order from this seller."
5,Worked great for me,"After hot weather caused my stick-on bubble level to break, I bought one of these at the campground store. Rather than drill mounting holes in my fifth wheel trailer, I made a bracket of sheet aluminum and attached it to the trailer's gooseneck.Frankly, I'm surprised at the two negative reviews this RV level received. I had no problem whatsoever with the ball ""sticking"" and giving false or uncertain readings.The ability to see the level in the rear view mirror makes side-to-side leveling easy. I back into my site, check the level, pull out a couple of feet and put down planks if necessary to raise the low side, and back onto the plank(s), and it's done, easy as that. I didn't use the front-to-back level feature of the Hopkins, preferring to use a larger level on the side of the trailer.I've traded in the trailer that had the Hopkins 04025, and will soon buy another one for the new trailer."
3,"A Bit Disappointing, but Gets Better with Use","I bought this Hopkins Level primarily because it had a good appearance and the price was right. However, it is not very repeatable and has a tendency for the ball to hang, giving a false reading. It is still useful, by tapping lightly on the frame I can get a usable reading. However, I wish I had spent a little more and bought a better level.After several months of use, the level is working better. The ball doesn't seem to hang as much and it is reasonably accurate when checked against my 4ft standard level.An update 8/30/09. After over a year of trying, I'm giving up on this level and ordering a Camco 25563 RV AccuLevel. I'm tired of wondering if the level ball is stuck or is giving a correct reading. At times I think it is reading correctly, then the ball slowly moves to a new position!"
3,"Close, But No Cigar","A good concept, but not well-executed. This level is visible from the drivers seat, but because it uses a steel ball in a ""smile-shaped"" liquid-filled tube(rather than a bubble), it is slightly erratic, and only gives an approximation of ""level"". I've found I still need to carry along a ""real"" level to finish the job.It requires drilling two hoes in the front of your trailer for mounting, and the clunky design stands the unit off from the front of the trailer about 3/32"". It does not mount very well to the curved front face of most modern trailers, nor for mounting with today's highly effective mounting adhesives. The supplied screws areplated steel, rather than stainless steel. Fortunately I had a supply of stainless steel screws on hand.Overall, I am disappointed, and wish I hadn't drilled the mounting holes in my trailer - 'cause now I can't remove this thing without leaving scars."
1,Not compatible with Vista,"The subject says it all...Vonage has a ""work around"" for Vista, but it doesn't work."
2,'Northernized southerner',"A lot of detail to weed through, which makes it more difficult to discern what is fact from what is the north's 'watered down' version of southern history. This can be even more disguised by so called southern writers who couple truth with what is commonly found in sources such as the educational materials in schools and the often 'historical junk' found on programs found on 'historical tv channels'. Search out what is written by real southern authors...they are out there."
2,The decline of modern man,"Well, well, well, it looks like ""Cliff"" has done it again. This fabulous entity has actually managed to create a cheatbook for The Holy Bible. Amazing. What's more amazing is that people pay money for it. Honestly, does anyone actually believe that a person can condense the entire 39 books of the Old Testament into a little yellow, book, published in a series known for its inaccuracies. And this in regards a book so involved and requirous of absolute accuracy. Hmm, perhaps I too may waste my money on this psuedo-tome...maybe not. I could take some more time and thought and actually read the book, but that would require too much effort. Oh well, back to my Comic Book Classics. It's like Cliff's Notes, but with cool pictures!"
3,One thing short of perfect.,"I've no problems with function and handling of the Macroscope, and the optics are what you'd expect from a quality roof prism unit...except for one thing. Somewhere in the optics path is a serious off-axis reflection source, a ghost image, so unless you have your eye precisely dead center, there's a nasty off axis ghosting. When you have your eye right on the center, the image is fine. Just a bit off axis, and the stray light ruins everything. So, you have to practice using it. When you get your eye on axis, this is a fine optical device.I'm addicted to close focus monoculars. The switch from watching deer to birds to bees in flowers to ants and critters in pond algae is irreplaceable. The Brunton Macroscope's the best, but bulky. Some day, perhaps, some manufacturer is going to create a close-focus, image stabilized ,camera mountable monocular and make me very happy."
5,Excellent Quality Monocular,"The Minox 8X25 is a great tool with very decent light capturing ability allowing good use in early morning and late evening. It is lightweight enough for me to carry frequently on mountain excursions. I found it easy to focus and I like its resistance to weather. The small stuffsack that comes with it is a little fumbly and really doesn't readily protect the entire unit quite as well as it could. If I could make one improvement, it would be to have removeable lense protectors. All in all, this is an excellent tool for me and is worth the extra expense compared to cheaper models. One thing to remember, .. a monocular is neither a set of binoculars nor a spotting scope and is more of a special use tool - lightweight compromise for telescopic viewing."
1,"Wow, you don't always get what you pay for","Expensive and German. I would have expected a sharp, clear, bright image. That is not what I got. I sent it back and was pleased with Amazon in that regard. Save your money and buy a 40 dollar scope that will give about the same performance."
5,It Is About Time For Such A book!!,"I knew this book was soon to come out in print. I was very happy when it did, and I could get a copy. Mr. Greer has written several books on druidism and magic, all very good. His new book is awesome! Anyone who is heathen, druid, pagan, hindu or the like should enjoy this book. Polytheism is not some foolish or out dated view of the multiverse. It is a ancient and wise view of the powers of this universe of ours. This book can put it in ways I'm not able to express. Do yourself a favor, read this book. If you have monotheist or dogmatic religious friends and familiy? Lend or buy them a copy, it may expand their thinking! Or at least your personal views on religion."
