2,Please shut up,"Anyone who has experienced severe depression for decades will not be willing -or able, in some cases -to put up with Wurtzel's whiny memoir.Geez, wait'll she hits menopause."
4,Very nice,I've been slowly converting to steel products as I gradually break my glass and ceramics in the kitchen. This thing is very cute and holds plenty of sugar for my needs. The spoon is very small but for coffee and tea use is fine.
2,"they wrote "" front left and right mount but they only send one strut mount!","the details said Anchor 2866 strut ""left and right"" which made me believe was going to get 2 anchor mount which would have been a deal.I only received one.It was false adverting.It should have said strut mount for left or right.Make it clear to the customers.I feel like I was mislead!!! not too happy about that!!First time this has happen to me on amazon.."
4,honest parlor music,"This is the type of parlor music our grandparents and great-grandparents relished. It's honest, bright, deliberate and very well-done. The only shame is that the program is so brief - thus the missing star. Cajuns and French Canadians take note."
5,Excellent Documentary About Weed,"For anyone who loves weed, needs weed, and is curious about all the hysteria it has created in our society this documentary is for you! I highly enjoyed it! It really goes into detail as to why cannabis is illegal and for what reason for what gain. Its really educational and heart warming too. It is mind blowing really you should agree especially after seeing how this documentary highlights how our corrupt government and banks have profited from this prohibition over sick people that need it. I found it interesting how weed unregulated is not as safe as what our government can grow because there can be chemicals used on it. There is so many reasons and more to watch this documentary! Its a must. It really educational and I know it has compelled me to stand up for our right to extraordinary medicine! One of gods greatest gifts to man."
3,It didnt win by this cheap documentary,"Documentary was cheap. there was some factual stuff in it. However when the narrator comments about medical being just recreational and then he says, ""and anyone being honest would have to agree"", he sounds just like the ignorant people who deny medical use, and cops that bust pot smokers (as they run speed behind the taxpayer's back...).Grow up Mr. Booth, who's side are you on really?"
1,Alex Jones? I'll pass,"Any movie that has any involvement from Alex Jones gets an instant 0 stars from me Sadly I have to give it one. Alex JOnes is a conspiracy kook of the highest order, and is someone who cannot be trusted. On his radio show he once claimed that juice boxes are turning kids gay.Boycott anything this kook has touched!"
4,Count Across,This game is right up there with Sorry for games that parents and grandparents enjoy playing with the kids. It is educational and fun for the kids and they don't even know they are learning.
3,"Love ""Through Life""","I think he should have a single of ""Through Life"" because that's the song I want,but I don't really want to have to buy the whole CD."
2,THIS CD IS THE WORST WU CD .,"This cd IS the worst Wu cd and it will always be,unless they become more comercial than they are now.Wu Tang is excellent,but this cd is the opposite of it.Go and buy it if you want,but don't blame me when you wasted your money for nothin'."
2,yuck,"I show love for ""Triumph"", ""Visionz"", and ""It's Yours"". The rest of the songs are either too long, or just boring. Until the best crew in Hip Hop comes up with the absolute s#@t on their next album, I will jammin off of their classic first album."
3,Wu - Tang Not Quite Forever,"Although Wu - Tang lyrically bombs on tracks like Triumph, Its Yourz, and Dog Sh*t, the album falls quite short of expectations. It fails to bring together the beats and rhymes that Enter The Wu Tang ( 36 Chambers ), all of the solo albums, and the 2 Gravediggaz albums did, in fact most of the tracks on this album are just big wastes of time."
3,A hit and miss,"Man, when I heard Reunited and the two tracks after back in 97, I thought, man, this is gonna be good. Then everysong after that except As High As Wu Tang get and It's Yours totally blew. So I thought, well, at least theres a second disc to enjoy, especially since Triumph is in it. Man, triumph got me going, but man, half the songs between that and song 14 with Cappadonna blew. But at least the other half was worth the listen. Then the shampoo song came on and I was like what the ****? Try copying it from someone else if you can or just listen to everyone elses advice about burning it, but hey, if your a big enough Wu fan, theres enough good songs, since theres a lot of songs period, to buy this. So, go ahead and decide what you want to do, but it's definitely not 36 chambers."
4,4rm tha slums of shaolin,"I got this CD the day it came out.Itis not as good as 36 chambers or the w,but it is still tight.It was also one of the first enhanced rap cds.The best songs are Wu-Tang,as high as we get,better tommorrow,maria,Triumph,andblack shampoo."
4,TOO MUCH SONGS,WHEN I FIRST BROUGHT THIS ALBUM I TOOK THE TWO DISCS HOME AND LISTEN TO IT.THE FIRST DISC WAS BRILLIANT EVERY SONG ON THERE WAS BANGING.MY FAVORITE SONG ON THERE WAS THE FIRST ONE.BUT THE SECOND DISC WAS NOT UP TO THE WU TANG STANDARD.SONGS LIKE CONDITIONER WITH SNOOP DOGG'S LAIDBACK STYLE DIDN'T FIT WITH THE WU TANG.BELLZ OF WAR WAS A FREAKING CLASSIC ALONG WITH TRIUMPH.INSPECTOR DECK SPAT ONE OF THE BEST VERSES ON THE ALBUM.THIS IS NOT A CLASSIC BUT IT IS THE BEST GROUP EFFORT THEY PUT OUT IN A LONG TIME.YOU CAN'T THROW IT OUT THE WINDOW EITHER.
3,"Disapointing, but still solid.","When I bought this, I was dissapointed, but it was worth the purchase. The sophmore jinx strikes again."
3,"It's okay, but I can't see what's the fuss is all about.","Thank goodness I didn't pay for this, I traded it for another album, (which was probably a mistake). The Wu-tang represent thug-life, and they are some good tracks (Triumph, For Heaven's Sake, Visionz, Heaterz, couple others) they are mostly pushed by their beats. They're lyrics are amazing, but sometimes the members don't run smooth together. I sometimes swear they're just mumbling to finish this album. Tracks sound too much the same throughout the album and too long. It isn't all bad, they are true hustlers who tell stories. Better just buy solo Wu-tang artists."
3,wu tang,"this album is alright. if u see it for a cheap price then get it, but if its full-price (which it normally is) don't get it. my fave songs on this album are: ""reunited, ""for heavens sake"", ""triumph"" & ""severe punishment""."
4,Wu-Bangers,"The nine swordsmen from Shaolin are back with there sophomore LP titled Wu-Tang Forever. The RZA is considered to be one of the best at producing hot beats and tracks like ""Reunited"", ""Triumph"" and ""Its Yourz"" prove it. But they wouldnt be half as hot if the lyrical ninjas didnt kill each track spitting bar after bar of pure genius. The ones that stand out the most are GZA, Tical and of course Ghost & Rae. If you are a rap fan then you should cop this album. Cause if u ain't got Wu in your stereo then you aint bumping the right stuff."
3,Not too bad,"Kind of dissapointing to me, beause it's more commercial, but I kind of always new they would start to go that way. Pretty good tracks on it, worth buying."
3,Should have been ONE Cd,"The important thing to understand is that the second disc is great, and the first disc is HORRIBLE. The only good songs on the first CD are ""A better tomorrow"" and ""It's Yourz"". So basically, you have to ask yourself if you want to buy a 2-CD Album and only play half of it.Also, I should add, that Wu-Tang stresses their lyrical abilities more than the musical aspect of the beats themselves. You'll find more catchy, musical rap somewhere else. Again though, the second CD is pretty good about all that. But if you're into some ill rhymes, check this album out. If you want Wu-Tang's best album, look no further than the 36 Chambers."
4,THIS IS NOT THE WORST WU CD,"yes 36 chambers is better but this cd is in no way bad. songs like triumph, dog shit, a better tomorrow, and its yourz are really tight. Dont expect another 36 chambers because there will never be another. Just enjoy this 4 what it is. Peace out.bye the way Killa Beez: The Swarm is the worst wu cd"
5,5 star hot as hell,this double disk of wu is one of the hottest ever.this represent the mad flavor of all members. wu keep bangin and hurry with the next cd. and keep it tight ahhight. wutang forever.....
5,The Album was great.,"If you like Hip-Hop, this album is a must have. It will crave any person's thirst for lyrics and beats."
5,Best Double CD I've Heard,"When it comes to the lyrics, Wu-Tang is the best group ever. RZA comes through with some of the most amazing,original beats I've ever heard. Wu uses creative metaphors and real-life problems to get there point across. Although there are more ""Warning to MCs tracks"" then real-live ghetto stories. Method Man shined the brightest of any Wu-Tang member on the LP. I can't wait for his solo album to come out November 17. I'm gonna be right on top of the first shipment!! Anyway my favorite tracks on this album were: ""Reunited"",""For Heaven's Sake"",""Scary Hours"",""Visonz"", ""A Better Tomorrow"", ""It's Yourz"", ""Triumph"", ""Bell's of War"", ""Duck Seazon"", ""Hellz Wind Staff"", and ""Heaterz""."
2,"Wu at their worste, when they are usually tight.","If you NEED this album to complete your WU-Tang collection, then buy it. If you need a good Wu-Tang album, dust off Enter the 36 Chambers and give that a spin instead.Very dissapointing. Skipping tracks for days just to get to 2-3 good songs, then I find myself swapping discs just to get to 2 other good songs. That right there should tell you how much more important ""hype"" was in this album then ""quality"". You barely get half of 1 decent CD with this 2 disc dissapointment.Anyone with any sense of good hip hop, and the Wu-Tang Clan, know this is their worste album."
1,overrated group,one good album and then this long winded mess.all of the way overrated rza beats sound the exact same.odb is the only thing that they have going for them aside from there clothes and wu wear.Pe and N.w.A they ain't.it's more marketing than it is good music coming from this crew.
2,Multi-Platinum over nothing,"Ultimately, the Wu-Tang Clan lived a hard life in the gutter-life and are obviously angry from it so they deliver hardcore lyrics with depressing words and aweful production. Well this latest album is no exception. I only give it 2 stars for extra effort for a double disk and that's it. Yes, they do sell millions of records but that's cause they're largely purchased from foreign Commy's in China and what have you. Give it up guys, Wu Tang you apparently have a large rap group but that doesn't even get you anywhere when you, every now and again, come out with group Wu-Tang albums. And we all know that the solo stuff goes no where! Give it up New York!! West Coast here to stay......"
1,StR8 GaRbAgE oN tHe HiGheST LeVEel PoSSibLe!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"i'm so embarrased 2 say that i owned a copy of this bUlLsH*tt album,but at least i didnt pay 4 it.it was given 2 me by a person whom i'd never seen or spoke 2 n my life. ater 2 dayz of complete torture i came 2 a conclusion that this cd and the so called ""Wu-tang"" clan iz the worst thing that ever happened 2 rapp r hip-hop. how can u release a double cd wit only 1 decent song ""It'z Yours"". u mean 2 tell me out of 13 or more people and all these so-called chambers this is da best u can do. ""ODB, RZA, Ghost face sucka, Genius/(idiot), i mean every one of them except Method man- iz totally wack. and method man only soundz good when he doing cameo'z on other artist sh*t. by all means necessary avoid this cd or any cd put out by the ""WU"" even if it'z free.(thatz my word). if u dont agree just mail me back, my address iz above."
4,GOOD BUT NOT PERFECT,"This album have two cd`s, and disc one is enhanced. You can see WU-TANG videos on this cd, and read about the WU-TANG members. This is a real pluss, but some of the tracks are very unlike WU-TANG. Tracks like Maria, Black Shampoo, Second Coming, The Closing and Sunshower make this double cd good but not perfect. The good things are that some of the songs like: Reunited, It`s Yourz, Triumph, Deadly Melody, The Projects and Heaterz are some of the best WU-TANG songs EVER. This cd is worth every dollar. And if you are a WU-TANG fan you got to reprecent, so buy it."
5,wu-tang agian and again,"wu tang got it going on! this wu tang cd has fresh rappers fresh lyrics and fresh beats baby! let me tell u something only 2 people in the wu tang clan sold out, method man and odb. great cd but wu tang 36 chambers is a better joint. peace."
5,Fat,"I dont have anything to say except this album is Great, really have to buy it if u dont have it. Great Rhymes, Great Flow, Fat Beat. Must Have. Wu-Forever."
4,This is the first review???,"I find that hard to believe. Whatever.Phat album. Four and a half stars, I just can't give five stars to an album that has a line ridiculing evolution on the first track. Sorry boys. Otherwise, some amazing beats and styles."
4,Great second album by the Wu-Tang Clan,"Continuing a great tradition of Wu-Albums is this double cd. I don't know how a true Wu fan could hate this album so much? Although it's a little long, It's got tight rapping,lyrics,production always equals another hit. Buy It fans."
5,Wu-Tang Clan is the best RAP group ever and WHAT!!!!!!!,"I think Wu-Tang is always going to be know as the best RAP group ever to lay thier hand on the MIKE but any ways Wu-Tang got it going on right now and they will always have it going on because they are straight the REAL and all they RAPabout is the real if you known what I mean WU-TANG are my people for life like they said ( WU-TANG IS HERE FOREVER) and WHAT!!!!!!!!!!!! WHA! WHA ! #1 FAN BROWN SUGAR STRAIGHT UP ""HOT 98 AND ON"" !!!!!!"
2,Pu-Tang,"Even though I hate East Coast music, Wu-Tang comes on the scene, as to me, as the best free-style rappers out. They don't have the same style as the rest of the Eastcoast rappers, I guess that's what makes them seem unique. I thought all their music, and cds they came out with were weak but, Wutang Forever was better then 36 Chambers. Triumph is the best song there. The rest are a little weak, the beats aren't that strong, the voices seemed like they were half asleep recording this but, their words make up for all of it. I give them a 2 for effort. Do Or Die's taking over the world."
2,Wu-tang should go back to old school.,I really believe from the heart that Wu-tang should swear less and write more lyrics that relate to their tough childwood.
1,This is for all yall thats taking hip hop off course,THIS ALBUM DOES NOT SHOW THE TALENT HELD IN THE CLAN NOR IS IT RAP FOR ALL YOU TDOGS JUMPING ON THE HIP HOP BAND WAGON AND CALLING IT RAP GO OUT AND BUY MC HAMMER AND VICE FOR YOUR RAP NEEDS AND STOP EXPLOITING THE HIP HOP NAME.
2,The worst Wu-tang album,"Wu-tang has always made good lp's,but this album is the real shit.There is only one track wich is ok ,but the rest really sucks.Don't waste your money on this shit,buy a solo album of one of Wu-tangs artists.Go for it .NOW!!!!!!!!!!!!"
4,"Good for anyone else, but not up to Wu-Tang capability....","Wu-Tang Clan's albums drop in quality in accordance to the order of releaseEnter The Wu-Tang (36 Chambers) - 10/10Forever - 8/10The W - 7/10Iron Flag - 6.5/108 Diagrams - 6Lyrically, they always deliver, but the energy of their last couple albums lacked the style and charisma that made their 1st album so epic.Anwyway, Forever, is dope, a lot of filler, but it's good if you favor 1 member (everyone does, Meth is my favorite) because it doubles their exposure whereas a single disc wouldn't allow them to contribute as much.In my opinion, ""All Eyez On Me"", ""R U Still Down?"", and ""Life After Death"" are completely justifiab;e in their double disc approach.Some of my favorite artists have dropped double disc albums that would've been classic if they were regular albums (Bone Thugs, Nas, and Wu-Tang)...This would've been much better as a singll disc album."
5,wu tang 4 eva,I got the album fast and in great condition. Every song played great and being from NYC i was lookin for this album for a hot minute i used to bump it in High School. Any way the album was in great condition no scratch on any thing.
1,Question of Ethics?,"The argument of of playing chess using a computer to make your moves under your own name, and using your skill as a chess player is very simple. This book shows you how to use a computer to win. But beng 12 and using my own brain on the chess board and not trying to find the best way to use a computer when playin on the internet or otherwise is the most honest when you use your name. Simple and honest."
4,Don Williams,Even though this DVD was produced in a non audience environment Don's fantastic voice was all that was needed and so I recommend it to all DW fans
5,Great for learning!,Great toy to teach my 2yr old her shapes. Love that it tells her the name of the shape. Durable. Easy to clean. She loves it!
3,Speaking Puzzle,"My 20 months old is slightly interested in this. I think she will enjoy it when she is a little older. What I did not care for, is that a couple of the pieces of the puzzle where you place them do not work. When we place the rectangle on there it does say rectangle. Another thing I do not like is that you could place any object over it and it says circle square without it it differentiating between the two. I will keep it, because we can still use it... But I probably would have returned it if it didn't take so much effort to return it."
3,Jagged wood peeling edges and says the wrong names of the shapes,I bought this puzzle for my 1 1/2 year old son who still enjoys mouthing objects andthe wood on the puzzle shape pieces is peeling. This product should be recalled because the puzzles that I'm use to receiving have smooth edges not jagged peelng edges. Also when my son hovers any shape over the wrong spot it says the name of the wrong shape which is very confusing for children.
3,A bit disappointed.,"I was excited when I found these talking puzzles. We care for a blind, mentally challenged adult. I wanted some new things to keep around the house for him to do. While the idea is great, in theory, they've missed the mark a bit. Like other reviewers, it's frustrating that the puzzle says the shape names no matter what you've placed over the area. I believe just moving your hand over the sensor is enough to make it talk. I'm not sure this will be educational. He was able to get the pieces in the puzzle slots fairly easily. He seemed to enjoy it and that's my number one goal."
2,Taking out the batteries!,"The sounds in this puzzle are produced when a sensor in each shape hole is covered. Tonight I hear an occasional ""octagon!"", ""square!"" coming from my daughter's toy box because of settling toys and nightfall. The sensor thing was just a bad idea. The fact that any puzzle piece (heck, even a finger touching the sensors) can set this thing off is not only annoying but confusing for kids. I am taking the batteries out and sitting with my daughter so I can make sure she learns the correct names for the shapes. It is a decent puzzle, just leave it without the batteries."
3,"Good Idea, Sound Doesn't Work Properly","Grandma ordered this for us (off of Amazon). The puzzle is great for a puzzle, but our sounds do not work properly. It will say ""circle"" over and over at random times. Sometimes it will say a different shape, but never at an appropriate time.I do not recommend for this reason."
3,Received Broken in Box,"I ordered this as a gift for my girl with other items (all that shipped from Amazon), everything else was serviceable when received except this it was broken in the box (will attempt to load photo). I'm sure she would have enjoyed this mug and it is probably a nice one, but it wasn't quite tough enough to make it through Amazons Packing & Shipping service..."
1,Un-American Expedition,"I purchased this and an American Expedition steel travel mug for myself. I was shocked to discover that both of these products are actually made in China (along with everything else that ""American"" Expedition sells, as far as I can tell).I paid more for this than I normally would for a similar mug thinking I was getting something special, but other than the artwork (which I do find attractive) it's just an average ceramic coffee mug.The words ""America"" and ""American"" appear about a dozen times on the packaging, along with words like ""authentic"" and ""pride."" Apparently American Expedition takes pride in America, just not enough to have their products made here."
4,A mans ideal mug...,Item is quite nice quality. I gave it 4 stars since it is made in china (what isn't?) if it was made in USA I think I would have given it 5 stars. I purchased this as a gift for someone and they liked it! The mug has neat detail and is larger than I thought it would be. The handle is larger than the usual mug handle which is nice as well if you have larger hands.
5,ceramic mug,very attractive and practical mug. I enjoy drinking my tea in it. I like the 18 oz capacity. the nature print is very attractive and informative.
5,Wonderful,if you are looking for a book about Gor here it is this really tells how Gorean Masters really act tword women (slaves) women are just property to them nothing more ..... this book really gets into the Gorean tradtions it was a wonderful book to read and i will read it over and over ..... i am not Gorean but I did like to read this book
5,Great for Bio Students,"I am not sure what ""professionals"" wear but in the Microbiology Lab coats and proper saftey gear are required and this coat suits my uses perfectly.It was a lot cheaper than the ones sold in the student store and has a great build aswell. I am not sure what the other reviewer says about sizing as I had no issues with it. I ordered an XL and am of medium build and it fit me well."
2,not great,"It serves its purpose but it's not very good quality. a button fell off within a week. however, the size was good for me. I'm 5'10"" 160 lbs"
5,Last Chapter,It was the lost book written by this person before he was killed it is a very old book and will become part of a collection It was in good shape for the age
2,so-so,"I have gotten only medocre results with this. Both with their mud and with dry mix. I think it may just take a lot of practice. so maybe the first 30 times don't count. But for orange peel, it seems to have trouble making the small drops. it can do ok after a lot of fooling around, and for $50 it beats the alternatives. If I had a compressor I would get a regular gun."
5,Me pido la ventana.... Hillarious!!!!!!,"Me pido la ventana es excelente, Andres desarrolla aspectos tradicionales de la sociedad colombiana, pero tambien abarca temas internacionales, ademas le agrega ingeniosos sonidos a su monologo...Personalmente pienso que se merece 5 estrellas... Es una comedia bien hecha, creativa y con el sello incomparable de Andres Lopez!Mis respetos Andres, esperamos tu gira en USA y tus compatriotas te seguiremos apoyando siempre desde aqui."
2,La pelota pero sin letras.,"Para todos los que hemos visto la pelota de letras y nos reimaos a carcajadas con la obra creo que es pertinente avisar que el nuevo trabajo se queda corto. Muchas repeticiones de los mismos chistes que vimos en La Pelota de Letras y lo nuevo es muy monotono. En este trabajo se enfoca en hacer muchos ruidos y parece como que trata de cubrir la falta de material con eso. No se, creo que el DVD se va a vender como arroz pero yo quede como decepcionado pues no me convencio."
3,interesting but repetitive,Is a repetition from the previous show la pelota de letras. Nothing new and he needs to be more universal
3,Más de lo mismo,"Si te gustó la ""Pelota de Letras"" y quieres más de lo mismo, este es el DVD para tí. Andrés Lopez es tal vez menos incisivo en esta obra, y a pesar de que me arrancó más de una sonrisa no fueron las carcajadas que hacían llorar en ""Pelota de Letras"".Tienes que haber vivido en Colombia por un buen tiempo para comprender la comedia; amigos latinos que la han visto quedan perdidos con las referencias a las regiones y los acentos. Más de un chiste requiere que conozcas algo de Bogotá.En otro aspecto, el DVD que vende Amazon es zona 1 y de muy buena calidad así que lo puedes comprar en confianza si vives en USA."
2,Me Pido La Ventana,"I went to Colombia and i got this DVD....I have 5 differents DVD players brands and i could not watch it because is Zone 4. Here in US, most of them are Zone 1, so It seems like it just for Latinamerican market in latinamerican.... so sad. If i try in my PC, i have the risk that stay in zone 4, because most of the PC have just 5 chances to switch the zone and i don't know how many my pc has had it."
1,DVD for region 4 - I won't be able to watch it,"I have the same problem that some of the reviewers had. I bought this DVD in Colombia and can't play it because all my DVD players are for region 1. I may watch it on the computer, but either only one time or many times in a row, since I can't keep changing back to 1 and 4. It would be good to hear from Andres Lopez why the decision to make it region 4 only was made."
3,Not much more than a paper holder,"I got this for free when it came with something else i purchased. It really hasn't proved to be of much use. The storage drawers really can't hold much more than paper and other very small items such as cd's or floppy disks. There are many other much better storage solutions out there, I wouldn't really recommend this."
2,A Book Longing to be Read and Understood,"Nancy McCallI am so disappointed because I really was looking forward to reading this book. Realizing it was printed as originally written, I thought I could get used to the ""s"" taking the place of the ""f"" and read the book, but that is the problem...I can't enjoy reading it. Maybe English people would not find this a problem for them."
5,What a read!,"I am reading this for my M.A. Thesis Project. I am quite pleased I chose this book. It has everything, courting, rape, virtue, sword fights/dueling, and death. The longest book published in English literature is exquisite."
4,A thought on the length ...,"Just a note to those who are commenting on the length or wondering why the text is so long.. well, this novel has the distinction of being the longest novel of the period written. It is possible that it has recently been outdone on page count, however.For those interested in sexual mores and attitudes historically during the Enlightenment period in Europe, this is a good text to read if you have the time, I would not call it the best novel ever written though."
2,Length Squashes Interesting Story,"The story follows Clarissa, a young woman who wants nothing more than to be left to herself. The problem is, she winds up being used as a pawn in the fortunes of her family and a libertine known as Lovelace. While the story is very interesting, the novel has many things going against it. The novel is entirely told in letters, which at times completely alienates the audience. The novel is also extremely long, and even the abridged version becomes a chore to read at times. It is worth a look, but only if you have a lot of patience and a lot of time."
3,Don't need to read it...,"Why waste your time plodding through this novel when you could read the collapsed version of it in the editorial review? To paraphrase the given paraphrase: This book is really long and the heroine dies. I was interested in giving this book a chance, but now that I know the beginning, middle, AND end, I don't see the point. Thanks a lot for putting that review on, Amazonians."
1,An fine example of poor writing.,"The only reason I can possibly give for reading this is to see the development of a novel at a very early stage. The plot is stiff, the characters (except for Lovelace) are very 2 dimensional. The material is redundant and gets very boring. The end is far from satisfying. The only thing that saves this novel from being a complete disaster is Lovelace's animated character. And even he is poorly handled by Richardson. It would seem Richardson makes him out to be a villain, and yet he was Clarissa's only hope. He was the only one who showed any genuine concern for Clarissa. As much as I love literature, this is one book I literally threw so many times in frustration. In all honesty, I feel that if Marlowe, Shakespeare, or Dickens tried to read this, they themselves would get restless and bored."
2,The First TOME ever written!!,"Clarissa or: The History of a Lady by that facinating old pervert Samuel Richardson (1689-1761) is probably the first tome ever written, well in English.It was published in about 8 or 9 volumes in 1747-1748 and became known as Richardson's masterpiece.IT IS A BORING AND ENDLESS T - O - M - E! ! ! !"
4,stylistic murder,"Clarissa is a very good novel. If you're prepared foran 18th-century epistolary novel and prepared to tackle a verylong novel, you won't feel sorry.However, I'd like to make some comments on this pseudo-scholar that edited this Penguin-Viking edition, a certain Mr Angus Ross, who had the bad taste of interfering with Richardson's style. In several places, some of Richardson's very long sentences were ""desecrated"" and broken down into two or more sentences.He alsotampered with Richardson's punctuation. And this editor had the gruff to say he did that to help us! He should have let us be the judge of that! As a matter of fact, a person who picks up an eighteenth-century epistolary novel is not expecting e-mail-length sentences, is he?"
5,I couldn't put it down,"I decided to read Richardson's CLARISSA after having so enjoyed his PAMELA in an eighteenth-century literature course. As excellent as PAMELA is, CLARISSA is truly Richardson's masterpiece. The author's technique of ""writing to the moment"" is at its most riveting here, not least during the title character's death scene. I found this scene in particular (as well as the entire section of the novel that leads up to it) extremely moving; for me it is the novel's highlight. If you enjoy novels, eighteenth century ones especially, you must read CLARISSA; it does take a long time to read, but it is definitely worth it."
5,Long and Lovely,You could lose yourself in this book. I did for months. It is truly fun and it carves itself into your mind. I can't forget it. It is long though.
2,Partially good,"I will perhaps like the snap on handle eventually, IF i can find brushes that aren't too large. The two cylindrical brushes included with the handle are useless---they are very thick. They won't even enter the huge space I have (which will admit something as thick as a business card). I threw them out. I kept the handle and MIGHT spend more money on a tapered brush if I can find a fine one. I did order their tapered brushes and found those to be too large (more money wasted)"
2,In Love With The British Sixties?,"If you're British this may well be a 5 star set for you. But I'm not so many of the 18 tracks offered here are simply foreign. They may or may not original, I don't know.The Overlanders, Geno Washington, Mark Wynter, The Truth, Neil Christan, Paper Dolls, had no crossover songs(hits) to the USA charts to speak of.Of coarse acts like Petula Clark, Donovan, The Searchers and The Foundations did better (some even excellent) but any singing by Long John Baldry is a kiss of death for me."
3,The Lighter Side Of Trek TOS,"Both of the Episodes on this DVD (Vol. 9) display the lighter side of the original series' cast members. In ""Shore Leave"" you see definite character expansion for the doctor, the navigator and the captain. Dr. McCoy shows more of his ""country doctor"" persona as he strolls along a lakeside path, Sulu displays his special interest in weaponry, taking the time to shoot of several rounds, while Captain Kirk reveals his long held desires to ""get even"" with a past star fleet academy classmate. You indeed see Kirk become a wild adolescent on this planet, when level headed Spock raises a concern about a pending crisis and Kirk shouts, ""Go warn the others, I've got a score to settle!"" and then bolts off to do some long overdue backside kicking! I think you'll enjoy watching both of these episodes again when your focus is on what these characters do to handle themselves in curious situations."
5,Question Please Answer-Thank You for the answer KJK5,"I would like to know does Star Trek The Original Series Season 3 have episodes 99 & 1: The Cage (B&W;/Color Version) / The Cage (Full Color Version) (1966) or do I have to buy the Star Trek The Original Series, Volume 40, Episodes 79, 99 & 1: Turnabout Intruder/ The Cage (B&W;/Color Version) / The Cage (Full Color Version) (1966)?Thank you for answering my question KJK5. I will do the same and wait December 14, 2004 to buy Star Trek Original Series Season 3."
3,Star Trek TOS season three reviewed by Chroesus,"Star Trek TOS season three is not the best of the three seasons and is a bit uneven in the quality of the episodes. It has it's highs and it'slows but well worth viewing.It isn't just nostalgia that makes me say it. The Trek shining vision of a positive future Rodenberry painted is still enthralling and inspiringdespite some comically bad episodes, like ""Spocks' Brain"".TOS triumphs even in it's worst season due to good acting and imagina-tive plots. The uninspiring special effects are simply the best that eracould provide.The DVDs themselves and the packaging are of the highest quality. Theextras are great, just like the first two seasons. The price is a bit onthe high side and you will want to shop around and see if you can find aa good deal on-line or elswhere. This whole TOS collection is a must ownfor trekkies."
5,Just Awesome!!!,The clarity of the entire series as shown on DVD is fantastic! The acting is great - you need to forgive the old time lack of special effects but they made up for it in the quality of acting and what was being shown!
5,"""And as you believe, so shall you do...so shall you do....","This was Star Trek's final season and unfortunatly, is often called the worst season because of the subpar writing. Well, I can't say that this was a corny season but that's what makes it so good! These are a great set of episodes and I proudly say that this was my favorite season of my favorite show and certainly, without question, the greatest television series ever created. This show redeemed televison of the 1960's!"
2,Stay of the Trek,"Usually an interesting video, but too much wasted time to fill the 50 minutes. Specifically, I don't give an Enterprise doo doo why Captain Jim always has to ""make out"" with the beautiful woman every time. Get on with the true plot. It's more interesting."
5,The Original Team Still Rocks!,"What I like about the original Star Trek series is the interplay between the characters. By today's standards, the special effects are pretty bad, but in many cases, that pushes the viewing experience into the ""so bad, it's good!"" category. Like the issue where a space alien is a man in a rubber suit with a dinosaur head, making ""Grrrrr!-Grrrrrr""! noises, and the issue where the bridge display screens have gone blank, but if you look closely, you can see black paper in waves simulating a blank screen. One more - the computers always recognize the voice of the user, and yet can't speak in a way even remotely human. Etc. etc.Which takes me back to my original comment - that the interplay between the characters is great. I still like the original series the best for that aspect. Partly it's nostalgia too - I never got to see all the episodes when they were on TV, so it's fun to see the series methodically and in the same order in which the shows were made.Ron Faxon"
5,"If you love Star Trek, the DVD series is a must have","Outstanding idea to come out w. the original series on DVD. I own all 3 seasons. Well written, great plotlines and characters - this show was ahead of its time in addressing social issues such as prejudice, custom and tradition, disaster, grief, power, gluttony, etc.The special effects are not so bad in the 3rd season, as per the first, but this was the way that things were done back in the day. The series does not have to hang its hat on explosions and such to carry itself."
4,Appealing episodes,"""Shore Leave"" The crew visits a planet in which your very thoughts become reality...no matter how deadly they are.""Squire of Gothos"" Kirk confronts Trelane, an alien who thinks that the crew of the Enterprise are his toys to play with."
3,Not my favorite,"Not my favorite of the Star Trek seasons, but the presentation is just as nice as the first 2 seasons."
5,"another question, please answer anyone who knows...","So, all of my life (I was born in 1963), I have heard of the infamous 'Blooper Reel'. Does anyone know whether this is on either set 2 or 3 of these DVD sets? I'd really like to see it as I've heard it's hilarious! Any ideas as to where to get it are also welcome. C"
2,A few bright spots in an otherwise terrible season,"There are some very good episodes from this season, but the rest are terrible. The main reason I bought this season was because I planned on seing every episode of the original Trek. In my opinion, the worst episode is ""the way to eden"", because of the space hippies who put on a concert to destract the crew while their cronies hijack the Enterprise. Anyway, ""The tholian Web"", ""Day of the dove"" ,""Plato's stepchildren"", ""Elaan of troyius"", ""specter of the gun"" and ""Turnabout intruder"" stand out from the rest. If you want the third season I suggest you get it used because $100 is too much for this season."
5,Still the BEST TV SHOW EVER!,"I started watching Star Trek when I was 10 years old. 1966.I was also a Lost In Space baby,but Star Trek is still my favorite Tv show of all time. At it's worst, it was great, at it's best, it was as close as Tv ever came to fine litterature.I had the privelege of meeting the entire cast and Gene himself in my wicked days of youth, and never a ensamble of kind, wonderful people I had ever met before, and never will again.But I ramble. Three of these great people are now gone, (Dee Kelly, Jimmy Doohan, and Gene) But this wonderful show they left us will never die.The ORIGINAL Star Trek was, and still is one of a kind. We will never see it's like again."
3,Star Trek Original Series Third Season,"Once again a great Star Trek Season, but at the time they didn't think that Star Trek was going over that well so this is the last season...IN the 80's it picked up a new generation of Trekkies///But if you love Star Trek..you will love this season"
3,Unfulfilled...,"The story needed more on the relationships between the characters, but unfortunately was full of boring political stuff that the reader didn't care all that much about. Towards the end of the book, I couldn't put it down; but, sadly, the end ultimately leaves the reader disappointed. Not a bad read, but there are better."
4,"Easy, quick read - great suspense with tragic ending","I just finished this book tonight. Last night, I had about 30 pages to go, and went to sleep thinking of the possible happy romantic endings I would find tonight. Mr. Kraus kept the suspense high through the last page, but while justice will be served, love's lost. The ending was not what I had entirely hoped for. A few details don't make sense to me, like how DJ could've found valium to drug his captor but can't find the car keys, and would the President's wife really have done THAT at THE convention? An epilog about Parker and Elaine would've put more closure on things. A little contrived towards the end, but still, you won't want to put it down. Sign me up for Mr. Kraus' next book!"
4,"A well crafted story, but so very tragic.","I could hardly put this book down. There were so many layers of deceit that I wanted to see some kind of justice at the end. Instead, I felt as though I was let down"
5,Political Reality,"This is probably Michael Lewis' least popular book, but it is also my favorite. Though it is now a little dated (it was about the '96 election) and focuses a little too much on the unlikely third party candidate Morry Taylor, it is a very honest portrayal of the mess that is presidential campaigning. Lewis was obviously not very experienced with the campaign trail and uses his sharp wit to highlight its unique and baffling characteristics (waving to no one from a plane stair case, having debates in front of now studio audience). It has great characters and Lewis does an excellent job of describing them, nd showing why it is so easy to fall for third party candidates and why they will never win. It is great political commentary and I would highly recommend it to anyone who likes politics, Michael Lewis books, or just an interesting, easy book about current events."
4,Great peek into the nitty gritty of politics,"This book answers the question, ""Why are some campaigns so uninspired?"" Michael Lewis chronicles Bob Dole's campaign as run by ""rented strangers"" and contrasts it with the inspiring but unsuccessful campaigns of the candidates for the 1996 Republican presidential nomination. The anecdotes are funny and provide a perspective that is sorely lacking in political books: the perspective of the people who lost elections."
4,Pretty Good,"THis was much like M Lewis's other books. He tells a great story, but this content wasn't as interesting. Stil a good read."
4,Must Read,"If you read Liar's Poker you will have to read this one.Although the subject matter is politics this is not the usual on theroad book. It shows the human side of compaining. Of course if the candidate is less then human you will find some very amusing and insitful reason for sucess and failure. You will read why the best man doesn't win, and the american public lose is most elections."
1,bbbbbbbbbbbooooooooooooo dont read,booooo do not read this abomination this contraption is by far the worst book that has ever been viewed by my eyes
2,A Missed Opportunity!!,"How did EMI miss the chance to include ALL the b-sides and US Version tracks that were not on the original UK release!?!?!?!?!?No 'Gimme Some Truth' or 'No No No' (B-side to Ready Steady Go) what a shame.....I had both the UK and US LPs in the early 80's played them both to death....What I've done is made up my own 16 track Ultimate 1st LP (I left off 'Trying For Kicks', 'This Heat' and 'Shakin' All Over' which were b-sides from the singles off Valley of the Dolls)....'No No No' can only, to my knowledge, be found on the Australian EMI Best of (along with 'Ugly Rash' and 'Rock On' the b-sides to Dancing with Myself)...luckly I bought it in Sydney...Henry Rollins bought it off me on Ebay...funny world."
5,UK PUNK AT ITS FINEST,"What can you say besides, simply genius. Idol and Tony James interfuse stripped down rock (punk), with pop sensibilities. Idol was at the top of his game during the UK Punk Invasion, unlike such in my opinion junk like rock the cradle of love. Idol has in my mind a voice made for punk, probaly the best punk voice ever, a tie between himself and Joey Ramone, RIP. If your into 70's punk, please pick up this cd, or just download Ready Steady Go, or Kiss Me Deadly. Excellent writing, excellent music. Kiss Me Deadly is one of his best songs, that and Running With The Boss Sound on Valley Of The Dolls. IT DOESNT GET ANY BETTER THAN THIS!! READY STEADY GO!"
5,Billy Idol's heyday,"This is a great album for almost anyone. It's got great rhythms and melodies and best of all, singing. Billy Idol was in his early twenties when he made this album, but his voice lacks nothing of its later quality. Instead it mixes the style he is known for with the real punk music of the era. If you like Billy Idol, you can't go without listening to Generation X."
1,Has issues that I'm not pleased with right out of the box,"First of all the lock should be great when you get it brand new. This one rattles around a lot and doesn't seem very solid. Also the key with the ""light"" doesn't even light up when you squeeze it."
3,Is not the lock that was sent as depicted in picture,"The lock you sent me is a different model and look that the lock that is in the picture. This lock that is in the picture was not sent, a different lock was."
2,Strong but Unreliable: Seized!,"This lock is very sturdy and successfully protected my bike quite well; a few times overnight in bad areas of NJ. However, after 3 years of heavy use it has become incredibly difficult to open. It requires a surgeon-like finesse to get the key to turn. Or, at least it used to. Now, it doesn't open at all. After lubricating with graphite, pounding with a hammer to loosen any stuck interior components and paying a locksmith to try to open it, the lock is still seized on my bike and my primary mode of transportation is disabled. There are numerous reports of OnGuard locks seizing on the internet, so my case is not isolated. My recommendation is to look to other brands for high-end u-locks."
3,Very heavy lock,This lock is a clunker. No joke. The mount that it comes with will not hold its weight and ends up just sliding around. I personally just keep it in my backpack but it really is really heavy. It's an intimidating lock though.
1,Does not last...,"OnGuard brand locks have dissapointed me on all three occasions that I have purchased them. The first was a cable, easily cut through and my bike stolen. Second was a U-lock similar to this and then this U-lock. The plastic casing on both u-locks broke off within a month on both. Shortly after, the locking mechanism froze to where the key would only turn 1/4 of the way. Purchased a Krypto (a bit more pricey) and it hasnt let me down yet. Far worth the avoided headache to pay a little bit more for a better brand lock.... I will definitely avoid OnGuard brand locks in the future."
2,"Strong Lock, Defective Holder","The plastic lock holder that is supposed to hold the lock on the frame broke after just 3 weeks of normal use. The weight of the lock is way too much for the plastic to handle, and it chipped away at the holder until it was useless. Now there is no easy way to carry this beast of a lock, short of a backpack or basket."
2,NOT good in cold weather,When it gets cold....ice/snow...this lock simply won't open. Needs to be heated at each end to allow locking mechanism to disengage. In my case I was able to wait for the weather to warm to above freezing -- then it would open.
3,"Heavy duty - and I mean ""heavy""","I bought this lock because of it's thickness and it's shorter length.The trade-off is the heavy weight, which gets tough when you add groceries to your load after a day at the shops.Yes, the keys do look flimsy, so please be careful with them. I took the advice of the other reviewers and I'm VERY careful with the key. You need to make sure the key is in as far as you can get it AND don't try to turn the key until you can feel the key readily turn.The shorter length also means you have to be selective about where/how you lock the bike up. If you use Sheldon Brown's lock strategy, you have to make sure the bike is really close to the post that you plan to lock against. Your bike will be very snug up against the post."
5,Works like a charm!,Works like its supposed to! Good price! Seems pretty strong. No one's stolen my bike yet!
4,So far so good,"I had this lock for about 2 months now. It's of course impossible to say how good a lock is at doing its job until you've either had a bike stolen or seen the saw-marks of some unsuccessful attempt, but I can say that in terms of usability the lock is good. The key turns freely, everything seems sturdy, and I feel like it's a good weight and size."
3,Not too hot!,Contrary to a previous review this pan is NOT meant to be used with very high heat. I seem to remember the manufacturer saying not to use over medium high heat. Especially if you own birds. In fact the fumes emitted can be deadly. Just ask your veterinarian.My pan has 3 scratches in it from family members who have usedmetal utensils despite requests from me not to.
1,Very disappointed with an expansion Pan,"I purchased this pan about 5-6 months ago and have really enjoyed using it - until last week. The handle fell off and it cannot be rescrewed on to the pan. The store will not take it back and I am out $. I had the impression it was a quality product, but I am back to cooking with pans that I've had for years and haven't fallen apart. I will NOT purchase this brand in the future especially since no one stands behind their product.Sincerely,N.P.Ann Arbor"
2,On Gold Mountain,"The story started out very interesting, then the story just seem to drag toward the end. I didn't even bother finishing the book."
2,Early California Gold Rush Era,The beginning of the book is very interesting. It starts really drag and become boring. It is very hard to keep up with the various family members.
3,HISTORY BOOK,"LISA SEE IS ONE OF MY ALL TIME FAVORITE AUTHORS BUT, FOR THE FIRST TIME I WAS DISAPPOINTED IN A BOOK SHE HAD WRITTEN. IT READS LIKE A HISTORY BOOK WITHOUT THE CHARM THAT SHE USUALLY SHOWS IN HER WRITING. THERE WAS JUST TOO MUCH DETAIL AND IT SEEMED WRITTEN WITHOUT EMOTION"
3,Immigration Nightmare,"This book was highly recommended. I found it difficult to enjoy. For me there were way too many main characters, all had Chinese names which were hard to sort out, and extremely complex relationships. The historical value of examinating Chinese imigration in the Nineteen Century was the most interesting part of reading this book, to me. It was something few Americans today know about.Since I have spent time in Los Angeles I could at least visualize the places written about. Sorry, it was not a book I would recommend."
1,0n size of book print,"I have not read this book, as yet, because the typeset is so small. I would've rather paid more than have to force myself to attempt the print. Why would you print a book which is uncomfortable to the eye? Truly you would need a magnifier to get through it. I probably will not read Lisa See's Memoirs, though I would like to."
3,More documentary than story,I've enjoyed Lisa See's other books and thought this would be more of the same. It is actually more of a family history and while interesting it seemed a bit self-serving. The main character lies and cheats to get himself and others into this country and then the author complains how badly the Chinese were treated (which of course does have some basis in truth.) Can't we all just be Americans and not divided by hyphens??
3,"Good factual historical, but boring if not American Chinese!","I persisted until the end, but was mostly bored with the historical aspect of this book. I thought is too long, and not really an interesting story. I guess if one was really interested in this type of history it would have been exciting."
4,Lisa See's First Book,"I glanced through all of Lisa See's books and this one appears to be her first. For a first effort, I thought was quite good. She found her passion from this book and went on to write stories where the characters were fictional and poetic license was more welcome. There were many assumptions of how the people felt along the way that seemed like they were a leap of faith to me, but her character development and her skill with conflict made those issues minor. One thing I would have liked to help me keep track of the people would have been a family tree to refer to.Sincerely,Barbara B. Horton"
2,On Gold Mountain,"It kept my interest enough to finish the book, but not enough to recommend it. I enjoyed Lisa See's other books much more."
2,san francisco is the Gold Mountain,"I'm not even halfway through this story but I'm done. Too much negative descriptions about the lives of the Chinese, and they are not the only ones to suffer coming to this country, but it's just too much. I thought I'd read more about Chinese history. My Mandarin isn't great, but I know Jiu Jin Shan is the Old Gold Mountain, name for San Francisco, not the United States. I don't want to continue to reading about so much negativity, sorry."
3,STRICTLY HISTORY OF FAMILY,Not like reading Lisa See's wonderful stories full of historical facts and fasinating characters. It's an examination of her genealogy and so many relatives that it's hard to keep them all sorted.
2,Interesting but not compelling,"I LOVED her Shanghai Girls and Dreams of Joy. Both excellent well written, compelling stories of people enduring incredible historical situations. Truly helped in understanding the experience of communist china and the ensueing nightmares for the people. Unfortunately her writing style did not create a compelling story in On Gold Mountain. It has many interesting historical facts regarding the conditions early Chinese Americans encountered, but again, the is no story that moves you from chapter to chapter. If you are looking to better understand the chinese american experience, its good. If you are looking for something as good as her other books, mught wait for another to come out."
4,The untold story of the struggle of Chinese-Americans,"There is so much written about the struggles of European immigrants who entered the United States during the nineteenth century. This is the first book I have come in contact with that truly illustrates the immense sacrifices and hardships from which Asian, specifically Chinese, immigrants had to rise up. These people lived lives of quiet desperation only to be rivaled, in our country, by the lives of the African-American slaves. This book teaches the reader so much while it subtly entertains you. To paraphrase one reviewer: it reads like a novel, but, amazingly enough, its all true!"
2,So very disappointing....,"Like so many other reviewers I am a follower of Lisa See's books. Each one of them have been enjoyable and often exceptional.Struggling thru 'On Gold Mountain', I kept waiting for some kind of impetus to keep going. Never losing faith in the author, I plodded on.Fifty percent thru the book, I tried not to abandon it and skipped thru bits and pieces of the remaining chapters. It just seemed more of the same.Lisa See prefaced the history of her family would often have to be told via bits and pieces and facts that were not always clear.Therefore, I found it difficult to accept her blow by blow narration in detail, detail, detail, and quotes from family members long gone.Had the book been much shorter, not weighed down with so much uninteresting descriptives, it would have been more a page turner.What bothered me most is that I really did not find myself engrossed in any of the characters. First introduced, I thought this one or that one would hold me fast...just didn't happen."
4,On Gold Mountain...,"This is an epic-type history of the See family in California and in China. I gained both historical and cultural insights that were not only interesting, but often surprising. Although I had read fiction and nonfiction about life in China before Communism, I was not aware of the life of Chinese immigrants and the numerous challenges they faced in the U.S. I found myself fully enthralled with the characters and the story line. I advise you to read carefully as keeping the characters straight requires a bit of mental gymnastics. I especially enjoyed reading about locations with which I am familiar: Long Beach, Pasadena, Los Angeles. Lisa See did extensive research and then, I'm sure, filled in the gaps on her own. I especially recommend this book for all who are immigrants or children of immigrants no matter where they are from."
4,On Gold Mountain,"Sometimes life stories can ramble on or have parts that are so slow it is a struggle to read on.LIfe can be like that. Not so with ""Gold Mountain"". What a facinating story, well researched and beautifully written. I couldn't put it down and have now purchased all of Lisa See's books."
4,What a great family history written as a novel,"I enjoyed this book very much. Amazing to read about one man's dreams and hard work from 4 generations ago still leaves a legacy and a still-running store to this day. I was broken-hearted reading about the treatment of the Chinese during the railroad building era of the West. Bigotry and racism are not new to America, and not limited to just Africans. I got confused sometimes with all the names, and had to refer to the family tree in the beginning of the book, but it was a wonderful story."
3,Disappointed,"I have read several of Lisa See's books and truly enjoyed them all. But this one seems totally different and the author sometimes struggles to make sense of the narrative and what is going on in the lives of the people in the book. At some points, the book reads like a list rather than a narrative. I realize that writing a history of your ancestors with limited information is difficult, but I just couldn't get into this story. I was disappointed."
2,thinly disguised history book,"I loved Snow Flower and the Secret Fan and that is why I bought this book. I generally like historical fiction. I read the first few chapters of this book and quit. The plot, if there ever was one, never became apparent."
4,Straight from the heart,"The offspring of interracial marriages usually end up doing a lot of soul searching about who you are and who you want to be. Family sagas are mulled over and dissected, conflicting cultures often force choices that Beaver Cleaver didn't have to deal with.On Gold Mountain is not only a compellingly woven family/cultural history of perserverence and willpower in the face of prejudice, it is also incorporates a very honest appraisal of skeletons that a not quite as forthright narrator as Ms. see would perhaps perfer to bury in a closet.It's a compelling page turner, and well worth reading, a vivid testimonial of a truly American family."
3,On Golden Mountain,"It was good at the beginning, but towards the very end.. it was not interesting at all. I skipped all of the ending."
5,generational story,"I like Lisa See's books and this is another example of her fine writing. This time, however, her focus is the story of her own family and their impact on their new country."
3,Interesting family history,"Interesting family history. The first half of the book is interesting ,but the rest was rather boring unless you are a member of the Lee family. This could have been a great story given the beauty by which Lisa Lee generally writes, but she seems to have given up the beautiful quality of her writing for more of a documentary for the benefit of the Lee family and not for her fans."
3,"Interesting historical perspective, but writing style can be over-the-top","It is difficult for me to say whether or not I liked this book. While I am drawn to its narrative, which covers several generations of Asian Americans, I had a hard time stomaching the author's style at certain points. For example:""'This is a terrible idea!' Eddy yelled, whacking his hand through the air like a karate master trying to split a pile of bricks.""""Why did one child, one husband, and no job create such a crushing burden for Stella? Because she had already been crushed by her childhood... [B]ecause her hopes, her expectations, her dreams had been crushed.""Overall, I'd recommend this for anyone interested in Asian American history, but I personally would not purchase it for my library."
1,bad karma (bad pun),"No melody, no harmony and mostly indestinguishable lyrics -- there's some hard earned money I'd like back again!"
1,Bubble Gum For 50 Year Olds,"This pretty boy just dosen't get it. He is to music as Keaneu Reeves is to acting. Forced scratchy vocal inflections, poor musicianship, and trite bubble gum songs are all this guy will ever produce. There is nothing on this album that even approaches interesting. It is quite funny that the masses are buying this garbage, but then again it makes sense."
5,FANTASTIC! It's great to have Rick Springfield back!!,"Rick Springfield has always been a favorite of mine, with fun, upbeat songs. His most recent album, Karma, is all that and more. While it has songs you can sing to, it also has songs that are thought provoking and meaningful. Rick once again has a touching tribute to his father on his album, which proves that he is not only a great musician, but also a wonderful person!"
3,Good Stuff,"That 80's teen idol/soap opera star hunk always considered himself a rock musician above anything else, but all of the baggage and Teen magazine covers kind of obscured the fact. His latest album, Karma, gives an indication that maybe he knew what he was talking about. This is pop/rock music, to be sure, but it's pretty darn good pop/rock music, performed with the sort of desperate intensity you might expect from someone trying to drag his career out of the ""Where are they now"" file. A few tracks are standard pop fare, but these are eclipsed by standout tracks like ""In Veronica's Head"", ""Hey Maria"", and ""Beautiful Prize"". If Springfield released this album under another name, it would be all over the radio."
5,One of my Favorite Albums of all-time,"The writing, music, and singing in this albums are simply superb. It's a different sound that you will be used to if you are a classic Rick Springfield fan, but it will grow on you if you give it a chance. It's almost got a country twang in some songs, but it just as much rock and roll and you expect from Springfield. I highly suggest you add this to your collection. You will NOT be disappointed."
5,Karma--The Great CD,"As a big fan of Rick Springfield, I jumped at the chance to buy this CD. I was not, and still am not, disappointed. Wonderful songs, with great messages...All around great CD.I even saw him in Vegas and now am an even bigger fan!!!!"
3,"A good attempt, but not great!!","I went to see Rick in concert and was thoroughly impressed and couldn't wait for Karma. I eventually ordered it as an import and started to listen. I listened and listened but I just was not warming up to it. I did eventually start to get in to it a little more but it just wasn't the same. It was just too spiritual for me. Maybe I'm just stuck in the 80's or something. For Springfield fans I do think you should get this album because it seems to hit everybody differently. Some like it, some don't. You decide for yourself."
5,He's Back,This is a must for the die hard Rick fans. The songs are great. It feels like he never took a break. I have a 5 year old who loves Rick and walks around with his walkman singing his songs.I hope is the beginning of what's to come.
3,Mature cd but not very fun,"The one thing I've always counted on with Rick was an element of fun music. This just didn't have it for me. Karma is a very mature offering which seems to be natural progression from Tao (probably my favorite cd) and Rock of Life, but Karma just didn't keep up with the previous two. I found it a tad TOO mature and TOO boring. I was hoping/expecting something more along the lines of Sahara Snow. Being introspective does not mean being boring. This just didn't happen to deliver the goods for me."
3,"Nice to See You're Back, Rick...","Nice to see Rick recording again. Although the album is pretty good, three major complaints - 1. Overuse of the electric slide guitar 2. Lyrics a bit heavy 3. Having his children perform (poorly) a recitation on the first trackThat said, the album is at least fairly enjoyable. Lighten up a bit, Rick - thanks for coming back!"
5,I find his music awesome,"I was never a real big Rick Springfeild fan until I saw him in concert this past summer in Cerritos.I must say that I think he was a fabulous performer, and so into his fans! I have never seen any performer connect with his audiance like that. Most concerts that I have been to the performer was too stoned to know he was performing, but not Rick! his Karma album is great, and I hope to see him at the ampatheatre in January....."
3,Nice Licorice Taste,"There is nothing particulary wrong with this product; I will likely be forever looking for a replica of what used to be sold as black licorice ropes made by the American Licorice Company aka Red Vines. Apparently, the company reached a point where the customer demand was lacking, and they disappeared from the market years ago. If this product was extruded at a somewhat thicker size (larger in diameter), there might be an additional softness in consistency and ideal texture that I am looking for. Even though these are not the hardness of ""laces"", they are not quite thick enough to provide what I wanted; and the cost of these is high."
5,"4"" Bamboo Skewers",I purchased 2 packages of these skewers for my daughter's wedding. We skewered cheeses and fruit on them...they worked very well...no hands/fingers in the food. The skewers were of good quality and were very sturdy. I would purchase these items again.
5,Handy little skewers for fruit shishkabobs,"I got the idea to use these from a magazine article using veggies. I used them for fruit for our church picnic and outside backyard barbeques, sticking them in covered styrofoam tucked in a cute container. I am very happy with these. Just the right size for 3 or 4 small pieces of fruit."
4,Not bad..but bacon kept sticking,"I bought this product for when I cook bacon and I wanted the bacon to turn out flat. The product definitely flattened the bacon but made it stick extremely bad to the bottom of the skillet. Generally when I cook bacon it sticks a little but this was so bad I demolished the bacon while trying to scrape it off the skillet. It might have been me but this doesn't usually happen, but overall it does what it says it is suppose to do."
5,Great Product,"Everything I expected. Heavy, functional. The review about difficult assembly made me a little hesitant before purchasing; however, assembling the handle can be accomplished easily in less than a minute. I've even used it like a paperweight on some ""almost permenantly rolled up"" newspapers to help them lie flat. Still, its best use is for the really thick slices of bacon that come from the local butcher, as intended. Cast iron is a great cooking tool as far as I'm concerned."
2,Unless you do a whole lotta bacon - not required,"Will cover 4-5 slices of bacon or 2 burgers. Found burgers were better under the broiler, so this sits in the cupboard most of the time. Not essential by any means."
3,Haven't used yet,Appears to be made well disappointed it didn't come assembled with the handles . To top it off the screws ate extremely tiny .
2,Not what I expected.,"When the Lodge Press arrived today, I was disappointed. One of the main reasons I ordered this item was due to its handle. The cromed handle reminded me of things I use to see at my grandmother's house. What I got was a handle that is painted black, and not the what the picture shows. This seems to happen a lot when ordering thru Amazon."
2,"Good weight, poor handle design","Apparently I didn't do my research very well when ordering this press. The weight of the press is nice, but it is smooth underneath (I assumed it would have the ridges like the grill pan). Perhaps that was my mistake, but I didn't see anything explicitly stated in the product description about that). Another problem with this grill press is that the handle must be assembled/attached by hand, and the way the handle screws into the press leaves nooks and crannies for bits of food and grease to get stuck. The ""cool grip"" handle gets hot and overall feels sort of springy/flimsy. It is also painted black, not sliver like in the picture. I am returning this and getting the panini press instead."
2,Lodge Logic Pre-Seasoned Round Cast-Iron Grill Press,"Much smaller than I expected. I should have asked for the diameter. Very nice, well made item but just too small for anything I can think of except one hamburger patty."
1,Poor design,"The worst thing about this grill press is that the handle is attached by two cheap recessed screws. The screw heads sit in depressions on the working surface of the press so they gather bits of food. This grill press is ""SKILLET STYLE"" which means that it the cruddy cast iron, pebble surfaced construction that will always seem a little filthy. There is NO reason to make it this way except to save on construction while passing the product off as having an antique quality. It would be much better if it were smooth and nonstick (like that modern KITCHENAID skillet I use it with). The handle gets pretty hot as well which is not surprising as it's all metal, and I have to use a pot holder. I will not buy LODGE products ever again and feel I was ripped off and duped by this expensive hunk of junk."
4,"Great, but messy","This press works great, but be prepared for a fair amount of clean up. I would suggest using it only when you have a fair amount of bacon to cook, otherwise I question whether it will be worth the cleanup.Other than that, it works great."
5,Perfect little light!,"This product says it fits 2.5 gal glass aquariums, but it also fits like a glove on the 5 gal glass versa top! I love this little light, and the replacement bulbs are incredibly cheap. I get them at PETCO and they are 2$ per bulb! This fixture makes it so easy, the lights are incandescent so they aren't blindingly bright, and you can dispose of them in the regular garbage. I also don't have to deal with those pesky starters! Great product, highly recommended."
5,Mad Props. ^_^,"I cannot believe my very ears. Lifetime has somehow captured all of the insecurity and missed opportunity that I've ever felt and created meaningful music out of it. ""Jersey's Best Dancers"" has become one of those ever few records that can keep me impressed musically and lyrically. I wish I would have been able to see this band at a show. It's just really a great loss when a band like this ceases to be. To me, the stand-out track would have to be ""loud, fast and scotty"". For instance, the near-closing of the song when Ari is singing ""...could you please pick up the phone"" Jeez...that's just a shot to my heart every time I hear it. We've all been there. I feel that I've done this album a disservice by not blabbing about the other songs. Rest assured that on the whole, this album is well worth picking up. To not give this album a listen would just be totally detrimental. This music resounds."
5,Lifetime is the best NJ has to offer,"Lifetime is definitely the best punk band to come out of NJ. The first time I listened to this cd I didn't get so into it, but the more and more I listened to it the more and more it grew on me. I can't wait to buy the rest of Lifetime's albums. What a shame I didn't catch on to them earlier...."
4,Excellent bilingual volume for learning Yupik language and culture,"Each page has yup'ik on the left, and english on the right. Excellent volume for learning about Yup'ik language and culture. Not really the best first choice if you're just wanting an introduction to Yup'ik -- but the essential for intermediate or advanced studies."
5,Beautiful and great value,"For the price, this is a great deal. The wood is great looking. It has two different colors: the outside of the branches are lighter and smoother and the insides are darker with more texture. I can't decide which side I'm going to place up. These ""medium"" sizes are probably equal to other sellers' ""large"" sizes. I ordered two and one piece weighted 3 lbs., the other was 2.5 lbs. A very heavy, dense wood. With free shipping, you can't beat it. Can't wait to get my large and extra large pieces!"
1,sorry !!!!,this product was i rip off the wood is the size of a rock. thought it would've been big enough to hold a baby iguana but like i said its very small .wish i could show a pic
2,Just order 1 at a time and you have a better chance,"Ordered 3 of these 1 was perfect size, 1 was ok and the third looks like a dog bone. Just an undersized straight piece of wood barely 11 inches long and not even 3 inches wide. the weight barely 12 oz. You'd think the person packing them would have noticed the tag wasn't attached and that it was a very small piece compared to the others. Buyer beware - You'd think Amazon would be more concerned about doing business better...."
1,"Warning, may kill fish.","Depending on your luck (or unluckyness i should say) the wood you get could have bacteria that, once boiled, are toxic to any fish that eat them. I lost a beautiful Farlowella and a Rubber lip pleco to this wood. Dissapointed."
3,"Good item, but not design I wanted","The mopani wood I received was not as creatively cut as I would have preferred. It was just a chunk of wood, nothing like the picture showes. For the projects I do with it, the $8 was a bit high, but I understand this wood is not cheap. It was just a chunk of wood with little to no creative style. Disappointed, but I think this type of woods needs to be viewed before purchasing as it is in the eye of the person pulling it out of the bin who determines just what is sent. If I were able to contact seller perhaps I could have given a description of the piece I was interested in. Won't buy from this seller again."
2,No 2 pieces of wood are the same but....,The piece I received was the mentioned length and width but was nothing more than that. A long flat piece of nice looking wood but of no real use in my aquarium without any spots for the fish to swim through or hide in. Cheers to Amazon for a full instant refund and free return shipping.
1,Product does not match Picture Shown,Received my item in today. It looked nothing like the one pictured. I expected receive a piece that was somewhat close to what was in the picture with branching limbs. Instead my piece was pretty flat.
1,Do not buy,"Not even close to what I wanted. Much much thicker than dimension state and shorter than dimension state. I have zero use for it because of this. Not worth returning though. Each piece is different so you're either lucky and get a good piece or not. I would recommend just going to the store and buying a piece. I should of listened to the other reviews, was just hoping I might get a usuable piece."
1,Tannic and Slimy,"Bought a piece of Zoo Med Mopani wood at Petco and soaked it for 2 weeks per directions, the water seemed to be clear at that point, but after a week in our aquarium it was turning the tank water amber, and the wood had extensive white, slimy mold all over it. (Water was crystal clear before this). I will be throwing the Mopani out and getting a sculptured resin rock. Waste of money."
1,garbage!,"I was really excited to get some mopani wood for my fish tank. when it arrived it looked great and was the perfect size. after having it in the water for about two days i started noticing little things all over the sides of my tank. i dont know what they were but they kind of cracked when i smashed them, they had an exoskeleton. while i was killing some i noticed another unwanted creature. little WORMS! i probably killed five of them and i dont know how many are still in the tank or in the fish! I don't know what to do now! i hope my fish are okay. and it does turn the water really orange"
2,Half-Burnt Root Ball,"Well, I was expecting a something a little more like the product photo. The wood that came looks like an 8"" long by 6"" diameter root-ball with the roots cut off. No cool branches or structure for my fish to play around. One half looks pretty cool, but the other looks like a piece of charcoal. Also, I had to boil the wood 7 times and soak it for 4 days with frequent water changes, and it still leached tannins.I would say, if your local pet store carries this wood, buy it there so at least you can see what it looks like. Ordering wood this way is a total crapshoot. I am going to keep the piece since it's cheap enough, but will not buy again."
3,WOW,"Beautiful wood however, after soaking it for four days in warm/hot water, with several water changes per day and, after three weeks in the tank. It is still turning the tank's water dark...so dark that in just one week after a five gallon water change of my 30 gallon tank, I can't see my fan-tail gold fish. So, I took out the larger piece of wood and left in the smaller one...we'll see what happens. Otherwise, the tea water looks mysterious and it looks like you're looking at a natural underwater stream bed as well, my snail looks like it has doubled in size. Yet, the gold fish's tails look thinner and more transparent than before. Otherwise, fish are happy & healthly. My suggestion: Use only a small piece of wood."
5,Better than expected,"Mine looks much like the photo. It is interesting shaped and multi colored wood. It does leak tannin, but IT IS A PIECE OF WOOD AFTER ALL! In time this will leach out and life will be good again. I could have soaked it, but I am not concerned, as it doesn't hurt the fish. A beautiful piece of wood for any price, especially for the $8.00 or so that it cost."
1,"all Mopani wood ! ""definately Think Twice""","ya, I thought this African wood would be a good idea: I bought four (4) Large pieces (Not For Aquariums)I went as far as demanding a Refund from Customer Service / Zoo Med Lab in California. ""Didn't want to Hear about it !""All I got is song-and-dance. at the end of the conversation - I suggested that if it is sooooo easy to soak the wood (the""tannin"" issue) ""Why don't you, as a merchant, take care of it before you market it ?"" again, didn't want to hear it.All that I will have is: ""Real Expensive Fire wood"" NOT for Aquariums."
1,just a big stick,Nothing like the picture. What I got is a stick about 10'' without any branch. I don't even want to bother change the product and be disappointed again.
5,2 Different pieces each very good,I purchased 2 of these and they were perfect. Both very different and they really add to the look in the aquarium.
1,did not fit,"the info on the amazon site said this would fit my civic,it did not,i found the right # by going to the manufactures site, i had to pay return shipping because i ordered the wrong # on the amazon site,i then ordered the correct # from amazon but didn't get the free shipping,the correct# part was not a very good fit. done with tryin to get it right, will keep the ill fitting one."
2,"Pretty from afar, doesn't actually work.","I bought this globe for my husband as a gift. It takes a while and some practice to get it to levitate and even once you can get it to levitate it only works for maybe a minute before the magnet at the top snaps it up. The globe itself is a thin, cheap plastic. I'm really unimpressed by this item, especially since it is fairly expensive for a globe. If the globe itself wasn't so cheaply made I wouldn't mind that the ""levitation"" is sketchy and brief at best. I would recommend people pass on this on this item."
2,Cheap,"I was very disappointed at how cheap the globe is and looks. It's a neat idea, but doesn't look that nice. Don't leave it anywhere that is accessible to children. If you grab the globe just a little to strong, it will crack easily. I would not recommend."
3,cool because these are my friends,"This movie was written by a friend and based on a wedding I attended about 8 years ago. Most of the characters are my best friends to this day and I went through a lot of the drama so it was cool and strange to see it as a movie. I didn't like the 9/11 tie-in or that 'Sam' was gone for three months in 2001 and then hadn't heard anything from any of his friends in 8 years. It was like a big time gap that was just glossed over. Generally though, good fun, light entertainment. And based on a true story to boot (I only wish we were are as good looking as the actors)!"
1,Slow plod,This movie was tauted to be in the vain of Sex and The City. Well there was no sex and no city. In short this movie was a slow and boring plod. The only people worth watching are...Will Estes and Sara Rue. Of which there is not enough. The rest I suggest you fast forward over. At times this movie was cringe worthy.
3,Over Washington,"I lived in the State of Washington for a number of years. While the footage of the state is good, the lack of subtitles leaves a person not familiar with the state not knowing what they are viewing. The makers of this DVD could easily have taken the time to include labels for each of the prominent landmarks they flew over. Additionally, as a professional charter and airline pilot, I question the 30-45 degree bank angles the pilot performed in making this film. Those angles did not enhance the scenic views, they detract from it."
1,"I wanted to like this pan, but the nonstick coating vanished","This pan works just great for stir fries, especially on electric stoves. The classic wok doesn't work well on an electric element, and this pan is the right shape and size to make Chinese dishes.However, within a few months, the teflon coating had vanished. The reason seems to be the surface design, which has a series of concentric, raised ridges. The teflon comes off the top of the ridges, maybe because you bump the edges of each ridge as you stir. This happens even with nylon or wooden utensils. The theory behind the circular ridges is that the teflon will be protected in the ""valleys"" and food that lands in them will release. Unfortunately, this theory didn't take into account the fact that nonstick coatings will flake, especially on an edge.A popular cooking magazine that rates cookware confirmed my observations that the coating on this brand is not durable. Too bad, because otherwise, this is a well-designed stir fry pan."
1,good for a short time,"Mine worked for a year, then the bottom non-stick surface started to peel off."
2,nonstick coatings flake off,"I have used two of this pan, and the coating flake off on both of them after less than a year of 7-days a week use. They are terrific new, but the coating does not last. For the same type of stir fry cooking, The one from Analon is better"
3,"Good for the price, but a lid would be nice","Stir-frying does work pretty well in this quasi-wok, but I'd use it more often if it came with a lid for simmering certain dishes. It's a real hassle to use aluminum foil when a wok-based dish needs covering. That said, the depth of the pan is very nice and the heating is even. In the 3 years or so that I've owned this pan, I've always been careful to use nylon utensils, and haven't had any problems with the Teflon flaking off as others have reported. At Amazon's current sale price, it's a good deal."
2,not worth the hassle,"Probably the first 9mo to 1yr, the pan works great. However, after a while, stuff starts to get into the ridges and the non-stick surface starts to flake off. This is going to the donation pile."
2,I am glad I did not write a review earlier,At first I was very pleased with my new Circulon Classic . But after 5 month of usage it started sticking. One year later it is totally worthless. Everything is sticking to it. I noticed today that they have lowered the price. For somebody who uses this skillet only sparingly it is good enough but for somebody who is planning on using it on a daily bases - Keep looking!
3,For Elementary School Libraries,"In this biography, author John Bankston has managed to make the rather sexy career of actress Alyssa Milano sound squeaky-clean. Even while referencing interviews in Maxim and Stuff magazines, Bankston has done quite a bit to clean up Milano's image. While useful for it's intended purpose, which I assume is Elementary age kids doing a book report, this is not an in-depth study. I doubt anyone expects it to be.Interestingly, though other books in this series include a complete filmography, Milano's is ""selected.""Also, I was not aware that Milano was running a big campaign to stop celebrity internet porn and I question that information being included in a book geared towards children.As always, an extra 1/2 star to any book that references Buffy the Vampire Slayer, which this does twice."
1,Disappointing,"I read the other reviews and, after buying this book, was deeply disappointed. It reads more like a history book and is difficult to follow. It is jumpy and not smooth in the books flow. Without knowing the area, the canyons and ridges all run together but the book is written as if everyone reading it has intimate knowledge of the area. It was also hard to keep up with all the people because, once again, the book jumps around so much.Nothing about this book flowed at all and the stories were disjointed. All in all, I was extremely disappointed with this book and would not recommend it to anyone looking for an easy reading, smooth flowing narrative of this outlaw."
4,It`s a prehistoric art book.,"This book is very special,although it is old and may not continue the today`s vision of the dinosaurs (for example,the Apatosaur is living in water)it is fun to see the old visions of the prehistoric. And this edition is completley updated,with the latest facts. The text is completley different from that of the old edition. It is also fun to see the new illustrations,although those are not made by Burian himself. I am a great enthusiast of his prehistoric paintings,and I think they are very inspiring,because I like to paint own dinos in aquarelle. Over all,Life Before Man is a classic in illustrated natural history books. The only thing I miss is that some of the old paintings are gone and has been replaced by others. Life Before Man covers the history of the Earth,from a time with volcanoes to the dawn of man. So,sit down and enjoy this exciting adventure under 3000 million years!"
5,Cover to cover top notch art work by Zdenek Burian.,The 233 illustrations in this book easily make the cover price seem trivial. Mr. Burian was one of the finest prehistoric illustrators ever. These paintings and drawings were previouly printed in several earlier works and combined here.
3,a Christian twist on popular discipline?,"I had seen Positive Discipline in the library and read it. I checked further into their product line and found this book. It has Bible verses throughout to appeal to the Christian parent, but I wondered how much of it was popular thought fitted to Christianity. Still undecided. Of many of the Christian parenting books I've read, this one's tips and suggestions didn't stay with me. I'll give it a second read, but it's not my go-to book when I need help."
2,Mediocre biography containing little info not in other works,"This book has a rather cheap and tacky format, with few pictures, and those not the ones likely to appeal to fans. Some of the text is rather snide, in a subtle way, and there is little acknowledgement of the depths of Brad Pitt's character. It would be hard to guess from this book that here we have an actor who is intelligent, subtle and talented. It is also out of date, ending with Seven, and still has him with Gwyneth Paltrow. A better buy is ""Brad Pitt - the rise to Stardom"", which at least has a good range of pictures, although it is also rather out of date now."
2,probador de bobinas basico,"Este probador de bobinas de fabricacion poco ortodoxa, que mas bien parece fabricacion casera,(bueno el producto mismo dice ""PATENTE PENDIENTE""). es bueno, incluso para un tecnico profesional debido a que en el mercado de las herramientas electronicas no existe producto que sea capaz de exitar las bobinas para saber si estan buenas. Y los equipos que existen son muy costosos y solo los tienen los grandes talleres. En cuanto al chispometro que viene con el probador, que es de la marca LISLE, prefiero el THEXTON 404 que trae un tubo transparente que sirve de acustico para escuchar la chispa. Es exelente para las bobinas de los vehiculos asiaticos que van dentro del distribuidor. LO RECOMIENDO !"
3,Works but........,"First, what is pictured on this page is NOT what I received. I received a purple bottle and it reads ALMOST the same on the bottle. It is a leave-in conditioner too, but it doesn't detangle the hair before combing through as well as the other/older version did. After a couple of months using it, it's OK, but I'm not impressed. It leaves my hair a bit sticky even when blended with water."
5,A lovely book on the joys of creating a happy home.,"This book, while written decades ago as the women's movement was in its infancy, still has much to offer today's woman. Ms. McGinley, a Pulitzer Prize-winning author, writes a book devoted to the ""world's oldest (and most honorable) profession"" that of housewife.Divided into three sections, Wife, House and Family, the book covers these traditional concerns with chapters on higher education for women, thrift as a philosophy, children's literature, hospitality and keeping up with the Joneses.A quick and enjoyable read, this book makes even the most devoted career-minded woman take a moment to savor the ways in which to improve one's home, meals and family life. This is one of those books that I pull out and reread over and over again when it is time to get some perspective on what's important in life. A truly wonderful book that while slightly dated--is never out of style!"
5,"Old- fashioned, relaxing and generally wonderful","I first read this book many years ago. My Amazon purchase of it was a gift for my daughter, and no doubt due to a yearning for a long ago, not- so- long ago time when women could pot geraniums or win Pulitzer prizes, but were in no way compelled to do either. This author did both, splendidly. As far as political correctness goes, this book is off the map. If you are an angry (aren't they usually?) so- called ""feminist,"" you will want to bomb my house for this review. If you want a look into what I believe to be a generally better world (and although the food recipes aren't all that great, at least they are included), with insights on everything from remodeling to house guests, you'll want to read this."
5,Interresting facts and opinions brought up,"The book was interesting and informative. There were a lot of facts, ideas and concepts brought up that made it very worthwhile to read.As would be expected, there were a few points where I disagreed with the author, but that is to be expected in any controversial book.I highly recommend it.Jerry Minchey"
1,Don't bother......,"This book is long on illustrating a make-believe world that the author desires, and short on facts.Very short on facts.......The author manages to insults virtually every racial and geographic group - except for his own, of course.Honestly, save your money, this book is a waste of time!"
3,Kunstler has an Agenda,"James Kunstler provides an important compilation and analysis of many trends that should alarm any thinking person on this planet. However, when evaluating potential solutions he goes beyond rational skepticism and moves solidly into apocalyptic cynicism. By chapter six it becomes clear that his real agenda is to rail against the evils of ""globalism"" including free enterprise and big business. Ironically he ruthlessly discounts the very factors which will likely help to mitigate the looming crises (i.e., science, technology, and a global approach).This book is an important read for its powerful synthesis of the factors at play in our world today, especially regarding oil and gas depletion. However, it needs to be read with an understanding of its author's partisan point of view."
1,The Long Rant,"""The Long Emergency"" is long on hyperbole and short on references. You will not find a lot of intellectual heavy lifting here, but lots of apocalyptic ranting and raving by the author. The central tenet of the book is summed up nicely in a Scientific American article from March of 1998 (available on the internet) titled ""The End of Cheap Oil"" by Colin J. Campbell and Jean H. Laherrere. This article is thirteen pages and will spare the reader a couple hundred extra pages of pessimistic conjecture and antisocial harangues. Colin Campbell and Jean Laherrere are former oil exploration geologists turned consultants who, applying theorems of M. King Hubbert to world oil reserves, conclude that world oil production will peak soon and then slowly decline. I suggest cutting to the chase and skipping ""The Long Emergency""."
1,doesn't stand the test of time,"6 years on from the publication of this book, the price of natural gas has dropped by around 50%, and the global airline and shipping industries are busier than ever. That's pretty much all you need to know about the value of this Malthusian tripe."
2,Heard that already...,"I thought that this book was a little boring because it just rehashed material that I have heard before: localizing the market, how the government must gain the public's trust, etc. I was looking for a book that supplied interesting facts and statistics about our current situation and I didn't find it here. The way the book was worded and the complicated vocabulary just didn't excite me."
2,Over-rated,"I was very excited for this book, but I honestly couldn't make it past the first chapter. I think the worst claim was when he siad that it a ruling elite could unleash a deadly virus on the world for which only they had the vaccines. I consider myself an environmentalist and know that global warming is an emergency that needs to be addressed, but from what I have read, this book does not compare to other books like ""Plan B"" by Lester Brown or ""A Green History of the World"" by Clive Ponting."
1,This is Alarmist Nonsense,"This book is just full of alarmist nonsense. Don't bother with this book unless you enjoy feeling despondent and depressed. Kunstler is ""the pessimist's pessimist"". It also contains a lot of negative views towards both Christians and Southern White men who enjoy NASCAR.There are much better books about oil and our future out there."
1,Simplistic Scare Scenarios from a non-scientist,"The author strung toether 3 contemporary myths creating an adult horror story. The 3 myths are: global warming; peak oil; and 9/11.To understand why global warming isn't real read the scientific appendix to Michael Crichton M.D.'s ""State of Fear"".To understand why peak oil isn't real read ""The Deep Hot Biosphere"" and ask yourself how much $ oil companies have made by touting the spectre of peak oil.To understand how 9/11 was a domestic intelligence operation and not islamic terrorism look at ""[...]"" on the internet (or dozens of other sites). Are you any safer now that we have a Homeland Security State or just more powerless?As in Watergate the question to ask is Qui Bono- who profits?"
1,The Sky is Falling!,"Future? Bleak. Like a Mad Max movie. Oil? Mostly gone. Nuclear power? Better start building nuclear power plants like crazy, but that probably won't happen. Hydrogen-based economy? Never happen. Horses? Better get one. The Southwest? Overrun by Aztecs. Rocky Mountain states? ""A desolate fate."" Mormons? ""On the march."" Manhattan? ""Old corporate towers abandoned and dangerous."" The South? Full of delusional violent crackers. Stay away from them. Black people? ""The urban ghettos may explode again."" Hmm...what else? The DC-NY Corridor? ""A forbidden zone."" Best career choice? Farmer. Carpenter. Probably due to the high demand for coffins, thanks to all the wars, starvation, AIDS, smallpox and flu viruses, not to mention all the crazy Bible-totin' Southerners and rap-spoutin' black men. Best place to live? Upstate New York where the author lives, but watch out: He says he has a shotgun and knows how to use it."
1,waste of time,"The Long Emergency is a total waste of time and money. Kunstler brings very little to the table that has not been said before. Rich Heinberg's books on Peak Oil and beyond are infinitely better in both content and scope. Kunstler ends his book with an outright racist ""analysis"" that belongs in the 1700s. He displays a pathetic view of race relations in the US, marked by ignorance, elitism, and prejudice (his own).I suggest he, and anyone else who buys into his view, read ""Uprooting Racism"" by Paul Kivel.Those interested in what urban, grassroots organizations are doing to prepare for ""The Long Emergency"" should check out these organizations:People's Grocery peoplesgrocery.org(...)peace,ryan"
1,Spouts governmental propaganda from the beginning...,"In the first chapter of Kunstler's book, he writes:""Our war against militant Islamic fundamentalism is only one elementamong an array of events already under way that will alter our relations withthe rest of the world, and compel us to live differently at home--sooner ratherthan later--whether we like it or not"".So, here is a guy who wants to inform us all about reality yet totally unaware that the ""war against militant Islamic fundamentalism"" was a manipulative and false premise. Kunstler need to read more and write less."
2,Good warning....bad solutions....,"....I really don't think going back to Mayberryis gonna cut it....even if it does for a while, what if we get smacked by some giant meteor shower (I wonder if anyone tried to warn the dinosaurs?). The only possible solution for the long term survival of the human species is to colonize space. THIS is where the emphasis should be! Vegetable gardens are fine but its like putting your head in the sand and hoping everything will go away. And what about the millions who don't have a garden?....do you think they will just go away and leave you alone??......doubt it.So NOW they are planning a permanent moonstation for starters...this should have developed right after the 1969 walk on the surface. Perhaps Kunstlers book will incite some urgency and buy us more time, I just wish the urgency was equally incited for the space program....PS.I don't expect many (any?) helpful reviews with this review....it seems that the survivalist ilk doesn't really likethe real solution imo."
4,A Better Book for the Peak Oil Beginner,"I read this book and Powerdown today, and The Long Emergency was both better researched and better presented. This is a decent book for those just now hearing of Peak Oil and wanting to read a smart yet pessamistic view of the future of humanity.I did not agree with all of the author's opinion, but he at least does a decent job of arguing most of his positions. Recommended."
4,good reference book,"i liked the book. It had alot of history written in it, like from the 1980-2010, so if there was any energy related news you missed, it was all in this book. It was very informational, easy reading style, i breezed right though it. However, i thought the writer was a little bit pessimistic. the authors thinks the United state will regress to the technology of the 1930's, with no electric and no automobiles. I don't see it that way, i feel that with all our scientists we will be able to have electricity in our homes/business and factories.... What i don't see is any autos/tractors. We might just have to go back to horses for everyday transportation. And use horses on the farm to pull plows. And trains will still be around, perhaps more of them, but with tiny nuclear fuel plants to heat up their steam engines.this book is worth buying."
3,Not a preparedness book...but..,"If you are beginning to suspect things are not going to be ok like the MSM is telling you, then this book is for you. The book basically tells you, not so good things are coming with our present dependence on finite resources. If you already know that things are going to get worse..save your money. This is NOT a preparedness book. The autor is merely a confirmation of what preparedness (prepper) folks already know. So if you need to read confirmation of your suspicions, get it. If you need info on what to do afterword...it is useless except for kindling."
4,Sobering Look At A Possible Future,"This book could be prophetic, but hopefully it is not. Mr. Kunstler has done a fine job of pulling together information from different areas such as science, politics and history as well as other fields. Oil will one day be depleted to the point of irrelevance as a viable energy source. The consequences may be more than American Society can handle.Because the book apparently is written as a worst case scenario, I will not give full credibility to Kunstler's nightmare vision of the future. But he seems right on the mark with his facts concerning the challenges of not just the U.S., but the whole world."
3,The world we know will end soon because we are running out of fuel !,This is a well researched and well written book but it seems to be premature because it came before fracking technology became well known. Fracking is now producing large amounts of gas and oil from rock layers that were not acessable before. The major theme of the book is that the world will run out energy needed to support our way of life before technology can find replacements. I have only read about one third of the book but I am interested enough to finish it It is worth reading but take the conclusions with a grain of salt
2,The Long Emergency,"Kunstler starts off with some interesting concepts and speculation on energy consumption and the ""end of oil"". He also raises some good questions but never really gets to any solid answers.His apocolyptic conclusions dismiss out of hand alternative technologies and his assumptions seemed to be based on his own opinion with little hard data to back them up.He speaks of ""going back to the land"" and in his own case he seems to have acted on it. Kunstler has already checked out of the human race and I'm not sure any of us should follow him based on this book.Just my 2cents."
1,Not for Me,"I have to agree with the other reviewer. It's not that I don't think all of this is going to happen. I have purchased numerous books on this subject for years - survival, planning for catastrophes, etc. (for many years - you should see my basement). However, I did not find this book helpful, and did not like the tone with which it was written. Just my opinion."
2,DEFINITELY FICTION,"Publishers weekly says: """"Kunstler's name is mostly associated with nonfiction works like The Long Emergency, a bleak prediction of what will happen when oil production no longer meets demand ---- the world economy will collapse and society as we know it will cease.""""This book however is nothing but the author's sick and profoundly pessimistic view of a possible future that he longs for, definitly fiction, possibly good fiction but not based on anything real. Environmentalist doomsayers are welcome to write their dreams of catastrophy as works of fiction but please don't try to pass them off as non-fiction."
3,Message lost,"I checked this book out from the library before purchasing, and I'm very glad I did. While the author has what I believe to be a message worth hearing, he loses the reader with his tone and constant repetition. Sadly, I fear his goal of ""waking America from their sleepwalking"" will not be achieved. I found myself skimming the book for new information, rather than reading from cover to cover."
3,Another Cassandra calling,"Kunstler offers much vallid research and seems to make sense about the immediate future. Unfortunately, his credibility drops to 50% when he gives an obviously pro-Israeli view of the Middle East and Israel's problems. His view of it makes it clear that he is a Jew (as am I) and he is clouded by bias. That bias undermines the validity of his book, in my opinion."
2,Rantathon,"Yes,oil is in decline.Fossil fuels need to be phased out.Climate change is real.HKs scenario seems far fetched.The ROad, Dystopia, ETC.Survivalist paranoia?You be the judge.Plenty of used copies around."
3,The Long Emergency,"This book was fun to read but did not have much sound science with in its discusseions. However, I would suggest it as a good read."
3,He Knows No Thermodynamics,"This book is fun to read, and his interpretation of history is rich and compelling. The book completely goes off the rails, though, in its coverage of alternative energy technologies because Mr. Kunstler doesn't know thermodynamics. He basically argues than when the EROEI ratio (which is not to be found in any thermo textbooks I've read) for fossil fuels falls below unity, we're done. Toast. E.g. if ethanol production has ever used fossil fuels in the past, it will never be sustainable in the future. Without these poorly thought out arguments, the Long Emergency goes poof.After that he has some weak coverage of economics, followed by some very cogent and accurate predictions about the housing bubble that more or less came true. While his writing is excellent throughout, there is richness and depth in his discussion of the soft sciences that is lacking in his discussion of the hard sciences."
2,The end is coming,"This book is good for one thing: Getting people to think about Peak oil and the credit crisis and how it will affect us in the future. Other than that, as others have said, you will basically get the opinions of the author presented as facts in a way that seeks to belittle anyone who does not share the same view.His disregard for alternative energy is laughable. His borderline hate for all people that are not like him is very evident. He not only believes that doom and gloom are the future but it is very evident that he wants this fate for the US.Overall, read this book with a grain of salt and there are probably much better discussions on Peak oil out there."
2,Better books available,"I've read several books on peak oil. This is not the most erudite book on the subject. The author is rambling in his approach to the subject matter, long on personal commentary, and even veers into a diatribe of Zionist views.I can barely say that I learned anything new from this book, and I can guarantee you that you'll spend your money better if you buy some of the other books available on the subject, at this time."
1,Incoherent,The trouble with all these non-mainsream ideas is that they do not hang together to make a coherent whole the way real science does. Hogan should stick to science fiction -- but perhaps he has!
1,Argument from ignorance = this book,"I checked this book out from the library; thank goodness I didn't waste money on it!I was hoping--hoping!--Hogan had some real substance, but this is the same, tired canard of ""I never studied biology and don't really understand it, so here's why it is wrong.""Look, if someone is going to write a book that exactly parrots the Five Major Misconceptions about Evolution (addressed at talk origins.org), then we're done. Thanks for playing.In short: buy this book if you want to be (re)convinced in your belief that ID is real and Evolution and biology are wrong. Buy this book if you want to know how a scientific-illiterate person ""reasons"" his way off the path, over the cliff and down into the valley of absurdity and ignorance. Buy this book if you're bored and have already read every Captain Underpants book out there. DON'T waste your time if you're educated with even a modicum of knowledge that is ladled out daily in biology courses across the country."
2,Just unnecessary,"This book, while written by two renowned computer scientists, is truly disappointing. In trying to discuss randomness and computation, this book just does a mediocre job on discussing randomized computation and also an equally poor job discussing relevant aspects of probability theory. Their approach is not novel and many of their examples can be found in other texts. If you really want to learn randomized computation, get Motwani et al's book on Randomized Algorithms. If you want to learn probability theory, get any advanced probability theory book like Spencer and Alon on the probabilistic method, one of Sheldon Ross's books, or even Grimmett and Stirzaker. Whatever you do don't get this weak hybrid of a book that will require you to get another book at some point to supplement your understanding."
2,ABSTRACT MATERIAL,I needed to buy this book for a probability and computing class. Not the best book for someone who is just learning this kind of material. I started to understand a bit better after watching Harvard's online lectures on Probability.
3,I wouldn't say it's dangerous...but it is downtempo,"Downtempo - the kind of music that makes you get in touch with your (or maybe someone elses) inner beauty...the kind of music that makes you want to just sit and close your eyes and listen...slow, smooth, sexy, and most of all, intriguing. Where does this cd give to that genre - in a few good tracks I'll point out:Lust in spaceSupersexOne around the moonOne - again Thievery Corporation doing what they do best!It could be GBLowin' it10Starting blockTurn and waistThose all rung nicely with me, made me enjoy this cd and made me hit the repeat button. If you can get it used, give it a shot, you'll find the hours will fly by..."
1,Waste of Money & Time,"As my son loved the movie, I bought him this game. I never saw him playing... He told me it is boring. So I started to play. I really thought, that after some time, it gets better. But it is always the same thing. Two different things to do, always and always.One of the worst games I have ever seen!!!!!"
5,Thank you!,"I am so happy with Men and Women, Equal Yet Different: A Brief Study of the Biblical Passages on Gender. It has become very useful in my studies. Thank you!"
1,Close-Minded,"It's extremely ELS Lutheran, so be prepared for what you're about to begin. If you are Lutheran, then this will probably be very agreeable towards you!"
2,This book is definitely for the beginner.,As a certified instructor I found this book boring and very basic. I found it boring because of the absence of pictures and so basic it was hard to focus to read it.
1,Ted's Reviews,"Time Life's production was of dismal quality. There is incomprehensible distortion. Bass was simply thrown together, with it being distorted in some instances, to nearly none at all in other parts. The only redeeming quality of Time Life's production was with Incredible Jerry Lee Lewis himself, in an interview. Even that was poorly done on Time Life's part. The DVD was an import from Mexico, which speaks for Time Life's care. Just contract it out no matter what the consequence. Jerry Lee Lewis is an incrdible accomplished artist. This DVD does not do Jerry Lee Lewis justice in any way. I rate the quality of the DVD as nothing more than junk. At he same time I applaud the genius of Jerry Lee Lewis, just not this DVD."
5,Im simply amazed about FIFA 07 on PS2,"The game is incredible. The last Fifa game i had was Fifa 04, so obviously it would be better by comparison, but it is still a great game. The dribbling is cool. If you are playing against a friend, they better be careful anytime you have the ball, because with a variety of dribbling moves, it is difficult to stop. To make up for this, most moves are very difficult to execute. The free kicks are cool, as you can have two guys next to the ball, have one guy fake kick, and the next guy takes a quick shot. The finesse shot is useful too. It takes some power away, but helps get the shot on target. The manager mode is fun, as you can adjust ticket prices, pick sponsors, and make everyday decisions. The scouting program is cool, so you can pick up fresh, young talent. It includes a lot of clubs from new countries, and the international teams are still there. simply a great game. Fun to play."
5,FIFA 2007... EA has done it again.,"FIFA 2007 is an excellent futbol (soccer) game. Overall, it is very much like FIFA 2006; however, there are a few extras such as the Turkish Super League and some new movements. The Manager mode is a very challenging and realistic mode. I would highly recommend this game to any soccer fan."
4,Pretty good for a game,I originally purchased this game for my husband and really had no intentions on playing the game. But I must admit... its kinda addictive. I like playing after work. It was a little difficult to get the moves down but that may be because I've never played on playstation before this game. I would seriously recommend this game to other women who would like to spend some quality time with their husbands or boyfriends
2,once again dissapointed,"EA once again did not satisfy me with this one. When i first played it i thought that it was way to unrealistic. the way the players dribble and run is just dissapointing. If you want a real soccer game that has everything but bad gameplay get winning eleven, i agree with the dude that said that winning eleven is better> It will not dissapoint you it plays alot smoother and the ball tends to move more naturally. Do your self a favor do not get this game"
2,A cartoon version of Football,"Eve thou this game has great graphics. The game's playability hasn't changed that much during the last years. Its more of an arcade version of football.I being a football fan, have only one word for all the Fifa fans out there. ""Winning Eleven"" a.k.a proevolucion soccer."
1,Misleading requirements,I never expected that the game could only be played if you have a broadband and your PS2 is connected to the internet.What a let down for my son when he opened Santa's gift and could not play his most requested game. The game should have an option to play offline but it simple prevents you from playing until you are conected.
5,The Best,"The reason i bought this game , is its a gift for someone in Brazil.Things in Brazil are either unobtainable, or to expensive.I buy it every year for him, and I know he loves it...It is also very popular and I understand very challenging...It makes a lot of people happy, and its great for entertaining guests,,,,We have a lot of Brazilian friends,,,and their number 1 game is fifa soccer,futbol!Pat Haynes"
1,Too fast which it make it unrealistic,"FIFA 07 is the same thing as older versions, the gameplay is too fast which it make it too unrealistic, can score goals from everywhere, if you don't know about the konami's series Winning Eleven or Pro-evolution you should try it, it is the best futbol game ever made."
1,DO NOT waste your money - SOCCER FANS,"This game is simply not in the same class as PRO EVOLUTION. I have a Pro-evolution 5 game , years older than this Fifa 07 and it runs rings around this Fifa 07 game. Vision of the game is way too distant, commentary isn't very reactive to what is happening in the game plus boring, handling of players is hopeless, replays and off sides... what the ???. It just had me wondering why would anyone REALLY rate this game well accept and unless they worked for the Fifa 07 franchise. THIS GAME IS A WASTE OF MONEY there are much better games out there out . Take the time to look around you'll be glad you did."
4,shon,i bought this game for my little brother. He is very trill sbout i. I my self is not into video game. After seeing him play the game I tried it a couple of times. The character look very real.. at one time I taught i was watching tv.
2,A very expensive roster update!,"Every year a new fifa comes out I say to myself, I'm not gonna spend 30 bucks on a game that changes very little over time, but every year I end up buying it anyway. This time I really mean it, I'm getting tired of the fifa series ending as a very expensive roster update. Let's face it, the teams pretty much stay the same with one or two major changes, and maybe change the uniforms a little, so that leaves the game being 5% new. The only real change to me came back in the day when you finally were able to jump with the wall on free kicks, after that no big changes at all. I suggest you stay away from wasting money and just spend a day updating the rosters manually. I gave it 2 stars just because I love soccer also because the graphics, gameplay, and overall presentation are ok."
4,FIFA07 Review amcyrman,"The game is great. It has a lot of leagues and teams and the graphics are very well done. The DT carrer mode has lots of fun. I haven't play a lot yet, but I can tell you that it's a great game to play for those love sport games."
4,Soccer Fifa x Winning Eleven,"More realistic than winning eleven.Playing with winning eleven you have a situation that Ronaldinho will miss a shot a couple of inches from the goal with no goalkeeper - with FIFA07 things like this doesn't happen.Less controls than winning eleven but much better graphics. Easy to play , configure, lot's of fun. Updated teams. At least 10 times more teams available than Winning Eleven"
4,Excellent Purchase,"It could be a 5 star game, but it allows users to modify players strength. It should be done automatically once a league is made."
2,"Weird band, unappealing CD","I read a review in MetalManiacs magazine that this was a really good CD, so I bought it and must say I was dissapointed. Very lame lyrics and artwork, seemed like something out of a DIsney Movie. The music was overrated too, poor singing and cheesy keyboards."
4,Great book on how to market good causes,"This book was assigned for class and I have enjoyed it thoroughly. Andresen's examples are great and her message is important: focus on the audience, not on your cause. The only thing I don't like about the book is the constant Robin Hood metaphor which seems like a gimmick in a book that is otherwise sincere."
3,What Friar Tuck Never Told Robin Hood about Marketing.,"Well...let's just say there is a lot Frier Tuck never told Robin Hood about marketing. This book misses the mark for small and medium sized non-profits. While Katya Andresen acknowledges the benefit of relationship building such as partnerships, nearly every point in this book is about selling, not marketing; not about building relationships, community building, and getting people on board. It is about turning from one campaign to another, from one donation to another. This book perpetuates the current trend of high maintenance-low impact supporters. Adapting T. M. Stafford's quote from Mario Murillo, ""it is better to make high impact-low maintenance disciples, than high maintenance-low impact converts"". Andresen's book focuses too much on low impact converts. If you have deep pockets, then you might be able to afford this. However most NPOs and NGOs do not have such a budget and therefore this book has a very small audience."
2,Lights on but nobody home,"The title sounds interesting but the content is contrived, less than useful, and very poorly presented. These so-called business secrets are hardly secrets at at all as a little but it of common sense will tell you.I think he was trying to use the Mossad myth in order to make a buck."
5,Entertaining Novel,"Very entertaining account of various missions of spies. Similar to other spy books where you wonder how one guy gets all these great missions -- except that this book has really fabulous lessons on tactical behavior. Although most of the missions he wrote about were well re-created and obscure enough to maybe have happened roughly the way he writes, one alleged Mossad mission he wrote about was actually performed by a CIA agent during the evacuation of Embassy hostages in Iran and was written about in numerous other books. Well worth reading."
5,FINALLY I can see the entire episode!,"I've been a fan for many years, so I know that, as lovely as the re-mastered episodes on cable television are, there are numerous key scenes that are chopped out. I bought these DVDs mainly to see the episodes in their entirety, and I wasn't disappointed. So glad I got them!"
1,DO NOT BUY!!!!!,"i have to say that I wound up opening only the 'Season One' volume of the set I received. In this volume, both sides of the disc are playable - regular DVD and DVD-HD, even though the latter is now obsolete. Unfortunately for me the very first disc of vol 1 had the regular version on top and there was a HUGE GASH - not 'scratch', 'GASH' - on it. I didn't even bother to remove it, or open the others. Paramount's quality control on this must have consisted of that gorilla we used to see in that ad tossing the American Tourister luggage around.There are MANY other warnings about quality control within the other negative reviews included here, but I ignored them 'cause the price was temporarily lowered to just over $100.00, and figured I'd take a chance. OOOPS! I should have listened, and urge anyone reading this to read the more detailed negative reviews, which mirror not only my particular problem but too many others for anyone to even CONSIDER buying this - at any !@#$%^& price!"
2,Frustrated buyer,"These disks are a sad product. The quality is below standard and is not worth the price. Stop's and starts, skips , lip sync out, angle on off with pauses. Volume so low on some disks that TV sound not strong enough to hear speech. Maximum frustratration trying to watch. Will try another set to verify quality. Took me a month to watch all disks and ran one day over 30 day return limit so I get to pay for shipping. GRRRR... I hope someone from Amazon reads this."
1,go to you tube,where you can watch this for free from CBS in high quality. I don't know why CBS doesn't just release this for a fair price. Instead it gouges and then undercuts itself at youtube.
4,Star Trek: TOS memories,"The episodes look so much better with the enhanced visuals. So far, I have watched mostly 2nd season episodes; a few from the 1st season; and one from the 3rd season: ""The Savage Curtain"". Strange to see Abraham Lincoln in the ...Curtain episode. That was a good story though. I think the best acting performance was William Windom's role as Commodore Matt Decker in the 2nd season's ""The Doomsday Machine"". You talk about someone who was overcome with guilt and sorrow after condemning his crew to death, then finding the ultimate sacrifice in taking his own life by piloting the Enterprise's shuttlecraft 'right down the throat' of that automated robot planet killer. Was Windom ever nominated for an Emmy award for his acting performance in that episode? I will continue to enjoy watching the rest of the episodes. I strongly believe that The Original Series was the best Star Trek series ever with Next Generation a close second.Ted H."
4,What's not to like?,Old time Star Trek fan who just received delivery on this dvd set. I've only seen a few episodes but love the way they remastered the episodes. Crisp colors and wonderful job on the special effects. Obviously great to watch in HD.
4,Old time Trek Fan,"As someone who has long enjoyed and appreciated the original Star Trek series, I think this newly remastered set is fantastic. The video is exceptionally clear and crisp. The re-recording of the theme in it's original score is wonderful. A number of the episodes have little additions given advances in technology. Those additions take nothing away from the origial and are a very pleasant surprise. This set is well worth acquiring for the die hard Trek fan."
4,"Old stuff now, but still enjoyable","Much of the ""science"" is unrealistic; dated, if you like. The special effects can seem a bit primitive now. Still; the humour that made many of these original episodes so enjoyable is still there. ""The Trouble with Tribbles"" has to be an all-time classic!"
4,The Ultimate version - for now,"Crystal-clear blu-ray versions of all 79 episodes of the Original Star Trek, with both the remastered special effects and the original versions as aired - what more could you ask for? Thousands of others have reviewed these episodes, so I'll just add: there's little to complain about here. Special features are decent, the transfer from the original film to Blu-Ray is great, and watching the episodes with new special effects brings out a new dimension. Negatives: while the packing is sturdy, you have to remove discs to see the lists of episodes, as they're printed on the inside cover of the box, hidden by the discs. And, in the 3-set I received, the Season 3 box is slimmer than Seasons 1 and 2, so it looks odd on the bookshelf. But those are minor quibbles - this is the ultimate edition, until whatever format replaces Blu-Rays."
4,Must Have,I have been a Star Trek fan forever and this remastered set is a must add to the library of any Star Trek fan. The only reason I gave it 4 out of 5 stars is due to the quality of the cheesy plastic sleeves that hold the DVDs which are flimsy and can break easy which is a stark difference from the attractive and space-aware outer cases.
4,An Educated TREKKER,"Thank goodness I know STAR TREK, and the order of the episodes. The order of the episodes is way off per season. I had to go back and forth, from disk to disk to see the episodes in order, what a pain in the @##! The quality of video and sound is excellent. The special features are a must see, and you should watch them all! A very good buy at an excellent price, for what you get."
4,Star Trek the original series,"Different to some people that didn't like the remastered parts of the dvds, I don't actually mind them. I didn't give it 5 stars cause the box of Season 1 came with some weird stains on it and I haven't been able to clean it. But it was like $80 cheaper than the one sold by amazon and the DVDs are in good condition so I guess there is always a catch with things being cheaper!"
5,Trekkies buy this,"If you're thinking of buying this, you probably are already a Trek fan and don't need a review of content, so context then: The episodes are all there (some out of order) in high quality. The menus are a bit clunky, but they're cute. The packaging is a horrendous waste of plastic, but again, it's cute."
2,"Save your money on the ""Bundle"" pack","You can buy each season for $104.00. They come in the exact cases. When you get your bundle DVD's, they are just the season DVD's in one shipping box. This is Amazon's way of making a little extra cash at your expense."
2,Faulty Discs on Season 2,"I liked playing the discs, it was very enjoyable seeing the old shows. Unfortunatly, I could not get any of the discs on Season 2 to play at all. Upon doing some research, I found out that in some situations, other people also had this same problem. I am using a Sharp Blu Ray player. It may be related to the type of player, or not, I am not sure. I would like to be able to play these discs, but I do not know how. I had to send the discs back for a refund, which I must say was a very easy process with Amazon. If anyone knows of a solution to the problem with the Season 2 discs, let me know."
4,"Love Trek, despise the DVD packaging","As others have indicated the series must get five stars, but this DVD distribution must cost it at least a star. The transfer quality stinks. The disks themselves are assembled in a flimsy plastic wallet with a flimsy plastic spine. The menus are the worst part. There is no play all button anywhere. There are long menu delays between you and your voyage. There are annoying switches regarding optional voice-over narration, not off the main menu, but stuck right in the middle of the episode selection dialogue, to get in your face every time you browse. What a shame."
4,Love Star Trek but don't love the Blu Ray version,I gave 4 stars because Star Trek is the best and the idea of the new FX into the old footage is inspired. But the Blu Ray conversion on these episodes isn't that great. Neither are the new FX. They could have done so much with this production idea but all they did was generate new looking ships with no detail.The ships have such little detail in fact that they look like prototypes or work in progress ships. These FX are far inferior to the old movie's because in the movie's the ships had detail. The new FX are better than the old TV show FX but it's obvious that these guys at paramount got lazy.Star Trek is one of the most inventive of all time. Paramount pictures are just lazy money grubbers who want to keep re-packaging these old episodes with no added value. 5 stars for Star Trek. 2 stars for the Blu Rays.
4,Makes The TOS Tolerable To Watch,"I'm a Trekkie but I've always had a hard time watching The Original Series. The campy dialogue, cheesy action, and 60s-era special effects might be tolerable for those who watched this show when they were younger and feel a sense of nostalgia towards it, but I'm not one of those people. I grew up on the original Star Wars Trilogy, Tron, Terminator, Star Trek The Next Generation, Deep Space 9, the TOS movies, etc. Making it through just the core episodes like 'Space Seed' and 'Mirror Mirror' of TOS always felt like a chore, until now. I've been much more forgiving towards the TOS with the Blu-Ray edition. While the stories, acting, and dialog are unchanged, the exterior shots, backgrounds, and some screen displays along with the hi-def picture and sound are very well done. They did as much as they possibly could do to appeal to a more modern audience and I think they succeeded."
1,Are you kidding!,"I love Star Trek. That said, you would have to be nuts to buy this package. $272 for all three seasons! If you buy them individually, they would cost $255! This is based on the $84 for the first season. I have all the episodes on tape. I will probably purchase the dvds for the sound and picture quality. But, I'm not stupid enough to fall for this."
5,Lucky Find.,I just bought this set at a pawn shop for an amazing $15.00 in new condition it's for my youngest son who loves anything Star Trek a lucky find.
1,pointless CGI looks like a bad video game,"Totally out of place and stands out like a sore thumb to the rest of the show. Dumb idea, badly executed. Annoying, distracting, 'nuff said."
1,More Out-of-Touch Pricing,I see this kind of sales stupidity all the time. Where a package is priced higher than the sum of buying the individual items. So is it $30 for the cardboard box that holds all three?Stupid sales people...
3,Two Problems WIth This DVD Set,"1. The Episode names are NOT listed on any disk and should be. Each of the 3 boxes with the disks has a series of cards that tells the Episode name per disk, this is wrong. I had to number each disk and ceate a Word document that has the disk number and the Episode Titles. I have never bought disks that did not have the names listed.2. Each of the 3 seasons comes in a plastic box with the Star Trek Emblem. Inside each box is a paper box. The outer plastic box is not needed and they can lower the price if they stop using this.3. The Color/Quality per Episode is AMAZING.This is a Must Have for any Star Trek fan if you can live with the Episodes not labeled per disk."
2,Defective product,"I had to order this product twice, and both times the dvd's were defective. I eventuly had to just get a refund and get the product elsewhere. One good thing was that the product arrived on time or early"
5,Fantastic,After watching this series in syndicated rerun I was stunned by how much was edited out of these episodes. The enhanced special effects aren't intrusive and add a lot to the episodes.It's amazing how well the series holds up and this cleaned up and enhanced video makes it a must have for anyone who enjoys really consistently good science fiction.
5,What can I say?,"A classic, of course, and I don't think they could have done any more to make the product a good buy."
5,SUPER-D- DUPER GOOD!!! Live long and prosper,Excellent!!! Packaging is cool. The extra features are more than expected. Thourghly enjoyed watching them again-WELL WORTH THE MONEY!
4,A Great Collection at a Good Price,"I won't go into how great watching the original series. Yes, I know it is cheezy, often lame melodramatic, scifi schlock...but watching these episodes with the kids, hearing the music, Shatner's portrayal of James T. Kirk, the special effects... now, my kids truly get and appreciate the popular culture ""in jokes"" related to this series. It just fun to watch.I would give it 5 stars but... the packaging drives me crazy but it was priced well and I got a good deal through the Amazon marktetplace A great value."
1,Video is jerky,The video is horrific. There are constant blurs and pauses that make it unwatchable. The DVD version is far superior. I do not recommend this product to anyone.
1,negative,Season one not functional on any of 3 dvd players tried...Seasons 2 and 3 are ok...Will contact Critics Choice Video for Season 1 replacement
5,"these were a great deal, even if not re-mastered","I bought these right before the re-mastered versions came out - at a steep discount. For the most part, on my HDTV, they look fine: there is occasional graininess in the images and similar distortions, but really, they are just fine. Indeed, they look about as sophisticated as they did when I first saw them on TV, which ironically is a great plus for me as I remember the 1960s crudeness with great pleasure. Thus, I would recommend this version warmly, if you can get it at a good price somewhere as it is no longer available. In my humble opinion, the souped-up version is fine, but ultimately unnecessary unless you can't watch an old show in all its glorious outdatedness. This really is the best TV there has ever been."
4,Poor Quality Plastic Cases,"The show is great etc, etc.My main pet peeve is the packaging. The plastic istoo brittle and breaks. You can hear it rattling around insidethe sealed season sets.I wasn't happy. I returned it and exchanged it for another setBUT EXACTLY THE SAME PROBLEM!!!This wasn't as bad as the first set, so I'll have to keep it.Paramount, USE BETTER PLASTIC!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,CGI abuse has become a cancer,"CGI abuse has become a disease ... a cancer.Some genius got the idea of tampering with the classic Star Trek by trying to ""improve"" some of the vintage 1960s visual effects with modern CGI.First they look out of place ... like a butcher job.Second, in many cases the original images look better than the even more cheesy computer video game quality CGI images.Also theme musics were changed ... etc...Basically it is a crime what they did to this classic TV seriesThe original DVD series (35 sheel cases - 2 shows per disc) is still the best"
3,Season 1 packaging,"For $200 you'd expect them to at least have consistent packaging for season 1. Why no logo on the side?Good re-mastering job, though."
4,One Silly Question,I have the Remastered version of ST-TOS on standard DVD. I'm quite pleased with everything about it and haven't experienced any difficulties in viewing. I couldn't find any mention in the reviews I read regarding my one small question: Where are the star Trek Bloopers???? Not including those was the biggest oversight in releasing this supposedly definitive edition. I was hoping they would at least be an easter egg but Nooooo! Stupid Stupid Stupid! How silly earthmen are.
1,Poor Quality,"Purchased the set a month ago and started watching the first season episodes. First couple of discs worked perfectly on both sides---stunning quality. Then disc 3 wouldn't play on side 1. Expected that from previous reviews, yet ""Miri"" on side 2 pixellated and stopped working. The other 2 episodes on that side were ok, though.Disc 4 on side 1 was not playable, yet side 2 was ok. Disc 5 was a joke. Side 1 not playable, and neither was side 2---all pixillated and stop and go. I'm afraid to see what will happen on later discs. It's clear that Season 1 discs weren't ready to ship. I hope the other seasons will work. Watch out for this product.Star Trek: The Original Series (Remastered) - Three Season Pack"
1,DVD's arrive in cracked case,"I love Star Trek, but when I received the $200 set, the inside special-made DVD carrier was busted & roughed up on season I. I returned it, since it was a lot a money. On receiving a new set, it was also shattered and the outside holder also cracked. Given the fragile nature of DVDs, I didn't want to find out, 6 months from now, that some of them would not play, so I returned it also.Maybe some folks wouldn't mind this problem, but for $200 I wanted something that wasn't broken from the git-go."
1,BUYER BEWARE!!! ~ Don't WASTE your money buying through Amazon!,"Bought this set for my husband for our anniversary. Was sent out first set that wouldn't play first season! Says HD Dvd on one side and standard on other. WELL neither side worked on season one. Tried it on both HD Dvd player and standard. Contacted Amazon, who sent out replacement set. Got before I even returned the first set. Opened first season only to have the same thing happene! Sent both sets back at same time. Amazon sent out third set, with promise of this set working. NOT only did season one not work. Season three did not work either! Got refund through Amazon. Found set through Costco for $40 LESS then Amazon! And it PLAYS! Amazon pulled sets to make sure they had working sets and is NOW selling them again!BUYER BEWARE! If you have newer DVD player these WILL not work in your player/recorder!"
2,Star Trek: The drug generation,"Captain Kirk, Spock, an extremely thin Scotty, Uhura looking darn good, and flaming George Takai. Man, I used to watch this stuff and liked it? I bought these thinking, I would really like to see them old episodes that I would faithfully watch every week as a kid. Gene Rodenberry had to be on drugs to make this stuff. The women beautiful, Kirk stays on top of that situation quite well. Spock giving steller performances as someone with no emotion. So silly it makes Plan 9 from outer space seem like a totally plausible storyline.Sure for old times sake, pick it up, but be warned: The initial sense of awe and inspiration from such shows wont bite you like they did when you were a young whelp. Live long and prosper."
2,Enough Is Never Enough 4 Some,"STICK WITH THE ORIGINAL BOX SET.A WASTE OF MONEY!!John L. BookPalm Springs, Ca."
2,Three pack,"I was very happy to get this product for Christmas for my boyfriend, we have watched many of the special features on the disks. My only complaint was that for the $200 I spent the condition of the box of the first season was damaged. It was cracked in several places and the inside box was damaged just a bit, the dics were all fine just the packaging could have been handled better."
2,Don't get the remastered set,"I bought season 3 in the remastered edition. I think this remastering was a terrible idea. It's vandalism, just like colorizing old movies. Taking a classic and editing out original footage and replacing it with something else changes it's character. Maybe they thought it would be cool to make the original series look like the later series but I don't want the original series to look like the later series. One of the things that's so great about the original is what they were able to achieve with such a small budget and low technology. I'm now ordering season 3 through Amazon.com marketplace in the older edition to match my seasons 1 and 2 and I'm going to get rid of the remastered one."
1,Cheaper Individually....,"Based on Amazon's prices as of 11/15/10, its about 60 dollars cheaper to buy each Remastered season individually then buying this 3 pack. Just an FYI for those of you that like to save money..."
2,Very disappointed,"I am a huge fan of the original Star Trek series, and I've had the DVDs of the complete original series for about 5 years. From repetitive watching, some of the episodes began to freeze in spots, so I ordered this new, remastered version. I have been extremely disappointed with them. While the remastered space scenes are better than what was in the original series, I find the rest of the scenes to be very dark and grainy, verging on being blurry. The video details on my old disks were much better, brighter, and made one feel like we were almost on the set with the actors. These remastered disks make me feel like I'm watching the episodes on an old black and white TV from the 50s, with fuzzy reception. Plus it is really annoying that the disks aren't labeled. If my old disks still all worked, I would have asked for my money back. My advice is for you to save your money, and don't order these disks."
5,Looks Nearly New,"The audio and video quality is very good, the restoration went well. The new special effects are not ""movie"" quality but still very good. If you do not want the new special effects you can watch it without the enhancements."
2,Way Over Priced,"The CD is excellent and what you would expect from Mr. Rogers. However, it is overpriced by about twenty dollars. It is available through Family Communications for much less than what individuals are trying to charge."
1,"A really bad, boring movie.","Omg, this is just an awful movie. We're not sure how Hope gets into her predictament but one thing is for sure. You don't really care either. There's no one here to care about, not enough blood or gore to keep you interested and no story. Do yourself a favor, pass on this one. Save your time and your money. I wouldn't even waste the rental fee."
3,"Surprisingly Well-Done, Yet...Frustrating","I rented this movie, assuming by its gruesome cover that it would be a gruesome, probably shlocky horror film (which I like from time to time). As I watched, I realized it really wasn't a horror movie at all, horrific or not. I saw it more as a psychological study of a person's will being completely broken (hence the title), via horrible abuse and restraint. It was well-acted and well shot. As much as I liked the film and would recommend it, I was somewhat frustrated by the things we never know (why is this happening? who is this man?), as well as the ending, which struck me as a little unfair as a conclusion. Then again, since this film is based on a true story, it may well be that this is just the way it was, and that's life. Anyway, I do recommend it."
2,NOT BAD,"THIS MOVIE IS ENTERTAINING. BROKEN STARTS OFF LIKE IT WAS IN THE MIDDLE OF THE MOVIE. THIS MOVIE IS STRANGE. YOU WONDER IF YOUR BEING HELD CAPTIVE FOR A STUPID REASON AND YOU HAD ONE CHANCE TO GET AWAY AND DIDN'T TAKE IT AFTER ALL THE TORTURE YOU WENT THROUGH, THEN YOU NEED TO BE DEAD! SOME GORY PARTS..."
3,Broken,"This was a good movie. It keeps your interest goin even though it is different, but interesting."
5,Allstar.,"All I can say is this Movie rocks. It's a shame it didn't make it to the big screen. There has been many different reviews on this movie. But all I suggest is watch it for yourself and make up your own mind. With a next to no money budget. (This movie delivers) So turn off the lights, grab afew beers and enjoy a trip into hell and back."
4,Pretty amazing for a no-budget film!,"I thought this was a pretty amazing film considering that it was shot by filmmakers with basically no budget whatsoever. Comparing it to a multi-million dollar studio film is a little unfair, and I really don't see it as being all that similar to Saw. It's about a deeply disturbed man who wants to create his own little society by abducting women, enslaving them, and controlling by means of violence. The acting was very convincing and the production quality was excellent considering that it was shot with a digital camcorder."
4,Not for the light stomached...,"If you love a good original horror, and/or thriller suspense; this is a good one to check out. If you know somebody that has this movie, borrow it. I can see where most people might not like spending money to own this type of torture-like film. I found most of the directions this movie took to be original and realistically creative. Watch the making of doc. I found myself pleased with the two film makers attitudes. I felt that i could relate to their views, and liked how they came upon making such a film. Their straight-forwardness is refreshing."
1,very disappointed,"This movie is not anything they say it is! I was very disappointed when watching,,,I kept waiting for the stomach turning scenes& they never came! The only thing that made this movie upsetting was finding out it's based on truth."
1,Seesaw,"First the pros...Now the cons...A hackneyed attempt to duplicate the gore in saw without any of the plot line.An estimated 56 total spoken words in the dialogI'm still wondering what I was watching...something about torturing people in the woods?Forget it I cared enough to watch the first 20 minuets of this tiered attempt at a movie, built on a shoestring budget, then rolled over and went to sleep...woke up, finished to see if there was any redeeming quality, wanted my money back. The cover states ""makes saw look like a children's movie"", and it's true if ""See Spot Run"" and ""Saw"" had a love child broken would be it."
2,Almost there....,"Really tried to like this movie. It had so much potential but ultimately falls really short. Everything about it is somewhat decent. But the glaring stupidity of the plot really gets to you.For gorehounds out there - stay away. There is none.Don't believe the hype about this being brutal, scary, disturbing etc.....You can do worse if there is nothing left to rent.The best part of the movie was the haunting music from Mortiis. It added the only element of emotion."
1,NOT WHAT IT SAYS IT IS,"I ordered this with the notion that it was the Sail Away TV show that aired in 2001. It is not. On the selling page it clearly states the actors who were on the Sail Away TV Show and the writers of said tv show. This information is misguiding and I when I got it in the mail today I was saddened to see that it wasn't the fun show I watched in 2001, but something completely different. Please update it so other customers will not have this problem."
3,Only Useable in a Dark Room,"The PK10 is a great pocket projector, but don't even bother trying to use it in a room with any source of light. For best results, the room should be pitch black."
4,Good Buy,"I was interested in this product at its debut but i wanted to wait for comments and ratings for this product before i purchased it. I am extremely glad that i did eventually buy the pk-10. It works great for my specific needs. I think that if you are looking for a tv projector you will want more power, but if you are in need of a projector for presentations and family events this is definetly it."
5,The Best Projector ever seen,"1. Its not heating up at all2. No Cooling period after shut down3. Don't have to worry about bulb replacement4. Very much portable5. We were able view a very big screen, even though they told it will be good for 60 inches"
1,Very disappointing,I picked this device because of the footprint and the LED light bulb. However it's apparent that LEDs are not ready yet for huge displays. We tried to use it once for a meeting but even with all the lights dimmed it was still not readable. It was returned the next morning.
2,WAY too dim for practical use,"This is a cute and very compact projector, but I think it is mostly a gimmick. It is so dim that the picture is unacceptable everywhere but in a VERY dark room within 4 feet of a highly reflective screen. If you know you'll always be in the dark, and within 4 feet of the screen, and you really need this degree of portability, then this is the projector for you. Otherwise, don't bother, or you'll just end up returning it like I did."
2,Disappointing,"I was very exited to buy this thing to use for a class I'm teaching. But, I tried to use it in class today, and it was not bright enough for anyone to read what was on the screen. It's fine in very low light, but in low to medium light, it's useless. I'm debating whether or not to return it.On the plus side, it is very small and easy to transport. And, it's very cute. But just not practical."
5,Badass lil projector,"This thing is smiply amazing. I picked one up brand new for $350, it came with a free battery and free shipping. Best deal ever.I can get about a 8-9 foot diagonal picture of good quality in a dark room, which is great for watching episodes of Lost, playing Mario Kart 64, and pretty much anything else. Certainly doesn't compare to many of the expensive projectors, but seriously, for that price, phenominal deal. Plus the insanely small size will impress absolutely anyone.I recommend this projector, especially if you can get a bargain like the one I got."
2,not as expected,"Although this is a very nice, compact projector, the lumens are just not what I had expected from a projector with an original price tag of $799. If I could find another one of the same size with 2000 lumens I would be very happy but this one seems to be the smallest on the market. Too bad, I thought I had really found a treasure, instead I got nothing more than a mediocre machine that only works in a darkened room. A real disappointment."
2,Problems with this Wrench,"I needed an adjustable wrench that would open up to 1-1/2"". This wrench would only open to 1-3/8"". It was advertised to open to 1-1/2"". Not only that problem, but the casting was so rough inside the slide mechanism, that the adjustment wheel would hang up about 1/2 way down. With some help from sandpaper, a Dremel tool,and some grease, I was able to remedy some of the problems, but still not perfect. I thought about returning the tool, but I finally decided to learn a lesson and accept the fact ""you usually get what you pay for""."
1,New Oxford Textbook of Psychiatry (2 Volume Set),"although the item i ordered was called ""New Oxford Textbook of Psychiatry (2 Volume Set)"" what arrived was only volume 2, not volume 1. evidently there was some ""miscommunication"" between the seller and Amazon. a real waste of time to order the advertised thing, receive only half of that, and then have to do a return."
5,Don Ho's Hawaiian Favorites,Don Ho was one of the most romantic singers of all time. Add that to Hawaiian music and you have a winner. I have about worn this CD out playing it and singing along!! Great! Though heis gone I am so glad his music remains with us.
3,It was ok,Not great but perfect for a Luau. He was one of my favorites many years ago but I can see that it doesn't really hold up except for Tiny Bubbles!
4,Good product and fast shipping!,Product was received as described in excellent condition and shipping was fast as well as packaged neatly!
3,O.K,"I don't know about this one...I listened to the samples, and even though I like Don Ho from what I've heard - I didn't like this. (Don Ho samples) It's an o.k CD, but I don't particularly like it."
3,The Atlantic Years,"Made in GER in 2000, Serial# 8122-73532-2, Playing Time 44:41This album collects tracks up to BC's 7th album, the 1976 Cobham/Duke collaboration ""Live - On Tour In Europe"".Part of the French series from which the disc takes its title, the liner notes (actually a bio) on the digipak are written in french.The tracks presented here from this ""explosive drummer"" (in their own words) cast a good description of his early solo stuff, except for the CD's closing track, from the live album above, which is so commercial it's not even funny...All songs are full-length, but still make the CD fall short by about 30 minutes of what would have been otherwise an interesting and worthwhile retrospective."
5,I love it!,"Milka is one of the leading producers of chocolates in the world. Founded in Switzerland in 1901, the brand quickly spread throughout Western Europe. In 1990, the company was acquired by Kraft, and their wonderful chocolate is now available throughout the world!I love Milka's Alpine Milk chocolate. It is absolutely delicious - not as sweet as many American chocolates, and with a rich and creamy texture. Want to try a great chocolate? Get Milka's Alpine Milk chocolate!(Review of Milka Alpine Milk Chocolate 100g)"
1,stale chocolates,"When I received my shipment of Milka chocolates from Euro Food Mart, they were already stale! I opened the first chocolate bar and more than half of it was discolored and obviously stale. I find it suspicious that the expiration date was coming up in six months yet the chocolate was already stale, and when i wrote to the customer service department of this company they told me I had to pay return shipping to send back the unopened chocolates for them to refund me. This is not the right way to do business and I am never buying anything from this company again. They should pay for the return shipping since I already paid a $10 shipping fee for this company to send me stale chocolates."
4,Very Eye Opening,"I had to watch this for a class, but would recommend it to any family who is suffering from an eating disorder. I would also recommend this to younger women who are considering an eating disorder, or for an early education intervention to educate them on eating disorders. Very sad, very effective."
4,Basically just organic Rasinettes...,"So, really, these are just organic Rasinettes. And if you like Rasinettes, but want a healthier version of them, get these.Each pack is 19% DV saturated fat for the day, which isn't too bad in my opinion, and they're delicious. Also, you want organic dairy especially, because the growth hormone fed to many cows on agrafarms in America is banned in all of Europe. (see the book Politically Incorrect Nutrition, ISBN 1890612340, also on Amazon)As for the expiration date, it's not a standard expiration, so I E-Mailed Sunridge Farms for more information. This is the reply I got:""We use a Julian date code system. This means the first three digits correspond to the day of the year in which it was made (i.e.: 059=Feb, 28th), the next two are the year (i.e.: 06=2006), and the last two are a batch code reference for us. Packaged product is good for 14 months if stored in 55-65 degrees."""
3,Hmm... dated already. Shame.,"Aside from the two versions of the great ""Ready to Go,"" this album has dated pretty badly. Lyrics that sounded somewhat cool and cheeky five years ago now seem trite... and I never could listen to ""Holly"" because of the stupidest lyric ever written: ""...in the Hollywood Bowl of Serial Killers! "" Bowl... Serial... Cereal... Get it? Ha-ha-ha. Oh those British."
2,boring and quickly aging sound,"I've seen reviewers relating this album to Garbage 2.0 and Elastica. This is far from true. Republic is techno-dance. They are capable musically and vocally but the lyrics to the songs and the melodies are lame and amateurish at best. ""Ready to go"" is cool but is not worth the price of the CD. Download the mp3 of it and move on."
2,Not Worth It !,"After reading through the book, I just found the book is writen by a so-called prose-fanncy player, but not a practical, serious writer.The book itself is wordy, ambiguous, lacking sense of precision and clarity in presenting his advice. If you take this book's advice serously, you'd at best be another fanncy writer in local papers, but not a writer of simplicity, precision, and taste."
5,Best book on writing I have in my entire collection,"This book fundamentally challenged and changed my view of writing. In simple and clear prose, Williams showed me how to write, true to the adage ""Show don't tell."" He gives examples of both good and bad writing and works through them, clearly showing what distinguishes good and bad writing, and how to avoid the latter. The book is so well written, that many years ago when I purchased the 5th edition, I was able to read and understand it thoroughly as a freshman in college, without needing an instructor or upperdivision English class to explain the principles of the book (which he sums up succinctly at the end of each lesson). Through his writing, Williams illustrated the principles of good writing far better than any of my English professors later did. If you wish to write well, let this book be the first and foremost step to your goal."
5,One the best guides for business writers,"Although it doesn't focus narrowly on business writing, Williams's book is an excellent resource for revision. It's on the short list of recommended resources in my book The McGraw-Hill 36-Hour Course in Business Writing and Communication."
4,Cat likes it.,I have one cat that likes these to scratch on very well. They are a little longer and she's the smaller cat. The only problem being is the cardboard gets worn out very quickly and they don't have refills and I can't find them very easily to buy.
4,Embellished Bras,"Not quite as good as Bedlah, Baubles and beads by the same author. Unnecessary purchase if you get the other book, but does have a lot of photos showing the various steps involved in embellishing a bra."
5,"Embellished Bras: Basic Techniques ,by Dawn Devine Brown ,","a very good book, showing how to make& decorate the bras ,with pictures/photos,& good comprehensive instrutions,defenatly a good scource/ reference book."
5,Great resource for creating your own costume!,This was a terrific book for me in creating my first costume bra from scratch. Not only are the processes easy to follow but Dawn's photos inspired me!
5,Embellished Bras: Basic Techniques,"With 20 years costuming experience and 9 years as a burlesque dancer, I can not tell you how invaluable this book is to any of us that practice the showgirl arts--be it burlesque, belly dance, samba, pin-up, cosplay, or anything where you need a great costume bra. This book covers everything, from working with fringe to appliqués to covering bra cups. I make sure all of my burlesque students see it and stress they should have a copy for their own library."
2,NEEDS A REWRITE TO BRING CURRENT,"This is a good reference book, but it really needs to be reqritten to include the latest models of Sun platforms."
2,"Outdated book, doesnt cover new Sun Enterprise Servers!!!","This book is ok for the older Sun Sparc hardware but its outdated by at least 4 years! There is no coverage of Sun Enterprise servers like the E10000, E3500 or E4000!!!! That makes the book a total waste of money!!! better off, go to docs.sun.com at least its free"
3,Good Hardware Overview but Dated,"The book covers a broad range of generic hardware specific performance/capacity issues well, but lacks information on newer systems (i.e. x500, 6500, 10000), and fails to cover Fibre Channel in enough detail (differences in FCP/SCSI, IP, NDMP, NTP, are not even mentioned)."
1,An extremely hostile collection of essays.,"The book is a strange collection of essays, mostly written by people extremely hostile to their subject. There's not even a common thread in the book. The claim of the editor that this collection could be considered a 'tribute' to Bookchin is absurd."
4,Good easy True Crime reading,Ann Rule is one of the best True Crime writers. I will be looking for more of her work. This book has some interesting stories and are easy reading and written well. I would recommend this book if you like true crime.
3,random bursts of electroic noise,"This album has been floating around for a few years now, seeming only to have limited pressings. Hopefully this new edition will stick around a bit longer for people to hear the music this band is making. Certianly not for all tastes, the album consists of long, almost subliminal soundscapes that you have to have up quite loud to actually hear. Just when you forgot the cd is still on, large rumbles boom out of your speakers. Some parts of the record have beats on them, most of it consists of bleeps and scratchy sounds. Some people will find it all amazingly inspiratoinal some people will find it downright annoying, i found i was somewhere inbetween."
5,best skin care product i've used,"put it on after you wash your face and leave it on for 5-10 mins. you'll feel it tingling as if it's getting deep into your pores and loosening up all that grime. wash it off, and voila! your skin looks new. i've never had my face feel this smooth and clean before - it really takes a layer off your complexion, which is awesome unless you're a lumberjack and like all that rough grease."
4,Pretty good.,"You cant feel masculine with a dry cracky orange mask on your face, you end up looking like The Thing after 2mins haha.other then that leaves my face feeling amazing fresh and clean."
3,5 hours in your dreams!!,"The duration of the battery is as much two and a half hours, when is fully charged the icon sometimes says that you have five hours but if you check again after one hour it says that you have left two hours, but five never."
3,Kind of Flimsy,"The sequins fall off and are everywhere, the velcro in the back was disappointing. I was hoping for a little more substantial fastener. But it is very cute and served its purpose quite well. It was a costume for a children's canine 4H drill team routine with a Wizard of Oz theme. Dorothy and Toto were adorable."
2,Choose something more durable than this!,"This costume is made of extremely cheap materials. Ours was already torn, straight out of the packaging. I regret the purchase. Save your money and find a better quality product."
3,Cute outfit too small!!!!,The advertisement shows a toddler wearing the dress extremely cute Looks great in person but it's literally for an arm baby no older than 1yr unless the toddler is very small. We bought it for a recital and though we had to return the item we would consider other items the customer sells.
5,Dorothy's costume from wizard of oz,"This was an adorable, well made, sequined , toddler dress .......it was much nice than i expected....my granddaughter looked adorable in the costume with theToto accessory....she received many compliments from shopkeepers in town on Halloween during the town parade...."
4,sparkly Dorothy costume,"My daughter was thrilled to receive this costume. It looks pretty much like the picture, appears well-made and able to withstand machine washings. However, the sparkles are missing on the upper-half of the skirt. (Something my six year old noticed immediately). Also, although the net-petticoat makes the dress skirt stand out, it's horribly itchy. My daughter screamed the first time she put it on. This problem was remedied by digging out the pantaloons from last year's Heidi costume. I think most little girls will really enjoy it."
3,Dorothy,Dress is very pretty. Good value for money. However after trying dress on we had glitter everywhere. It has been lots of fun to pretend to be Dorothy. Would buy again.
4,Cute for Halloween costume,"I ordered this for my daughter who is two for Halloween and my other children have the tin man and the scarecrow so Dorothy only made sense. I like the outfit it's cute, really cute on my daughter. She is about 25 lbs and the outfits fits okay she will not be able to wear it next year though because it will be too small but it cute for this year. It's really pretty on but the material is costume so it's not made to wear all day everyday for me it's good enough for just Halloween."
1,Not worth the money,"I ordered this for my daughter, she loves wizard of oz. I ordered this for her birthday, First of all I ordered a small and got a meduim. Then when I got it the shoulder straps were all twisted, I think I am gonna have to cut the straps off and re sew them. Too much money for this costume, its not worth it."
3,Don't be in a hurry!!,We recently received this costume and it is made fairly well.Decent price for the costume. I think it will hold up for Halloween. HOWEVER do not be in a hurry if you order from this company. It took almost 4 weeks to receive this item. I attempted to email the company with no response. Even though I ended up being pleased with the costume I will not order from them again due to the very lengthy delivery time and lack of response to my emails.
2,Dorothy costume,"This is an adorable but flimsy costume. Don't expect it to last a long time. Also, the sizing is a little different. I bought a size 4-6 only to find out thatit fits ages 3-4. My 4-year-old loves the costume, but a sturdier version would have been preferable."
4,"Good replica, but needed tweeking.","This costume came pretty quickly. The dress itself fit my 4 yr old very well. I did need to tighten the straps, but I expected that from reading another review. The crinalin (sp?) was a bit flimsy & ripped pretty easily off of the dress, but it can be worn without it. Overall the best replica I've seen so far."
3,Other reviews are right on,"Shipping was fairly fast for this item but the 3rd party I ordered it from has the poorest customer service. When we received this item it was entirely too big for my daughter, I also agree with the other reviewers saying it was poorly made. It seemed like it was just thrown together and the bow isn't very cute at all, you could end up making your own alot nicer. I ended up buying her a sequenced one from a local retailer and it was beautiful. I tried to return it to the seller who in turn never responded to any emails I sent them, but kudos to Amazon who always comes back trying to help the customer they fixed everything."
5,The Real DRESS!,"my daughters love this dress.. its the actual ""wizard of oz"" licensed dress... perfect and great quality and even comes with matching bows!5 stars all the way!"
5,Very Authentic,"Truly adorable! I purchased this dress based on some of the reviews and have to admit is was very authentic looking, reasonably priced and definitely not an off the shelf costume."
3,Dorothy,It was very cute costume with the sequin but they kept falling off.The size was off as well... very tight for my girl.
1,Smelled like Pot so badly we had to bathe our 6 year old.,"Got the dress and was excited for our 6 year old to be dorthy this year, but the dress reeked so badly of pot we had to return it, even washing and fabrezeing the dress didn't help with the smell. DONT BUY FROM THESE PEOPLE!!"
2,Low quality costume tears within hours of putting it on.,"My daughters costume tore when she first tried it on, we sewed it and halfway thru trick-or-treating the hemline was torn and hanging down to her knee."
5,Dorothy Costume,"My daughter, who is 5, wanted to be dorothy for Halloween, so I found this Dorothy costume and ordered it. I was a little nervous about not having her try in on first because she is very picky, but ordered it anyways. She LOVES it! It has a shimmer to it and the underlay makes it a little poofy which she loves so she can spin."
1,rayjor68,"I ordered this for my 4 year old granddaughter , since she loves to watch Wizard of Oz so much and dress like Dorthy. however, she will not even wear it. The dress has a petty coat inside and itches her so much she wants to give it away.... waste of money in item and shipping charges...I do not recommend for any child.."
5,The best book on ball juggling.,I first read this book about 20 years ago. It is the best and most complete work on ball juggling (with chapters on rings and clubs) around. It is very slow and thorough and well worth the effort to get through. I have been juggling for more than 20 years and I still refer to my copy from time to time
2,video card,"I was happy to find a card for my dell 2400 and was happy with the price, however the card did not work. My computer could not find the driver and the driver that came with it would not install. I had to take it out and try a different card. I hope they will take the card back as it won't work in my computer."
1,Disappointing,"The product was delivered on time, but was non-functional out of the box.What was worst, was that it was around the holidays, and I was unable to get to it right away.By the time I went to install it, and found that it did not work; I was unable to exchange it.Would have accepted a lesser product of the same design, that worked."
1,"nice sentiment, but flat poems","While I concede that this book is heartfelt, the execution of the poems themselves is not that spectacular. The use of language is unoriginal, often supremely dry and well, ordinary for lack of a better term, and Burns doesn't have a particularly keen grasp of the use of the lyric is a way that rises above the obvious. Ultimately disappointing, because heartfelt sentiment alone does not poetry make. Too many books get attention just because someone had a tragedy in their lives. Lets see if Burns can write about anything else with any effect"
5,Works well,I bought this for my baby turtle dino and it fits well.The suction also stays intact.At first he ignored it but now he basks on top of it then jumps down and hides under the dock...he fully enjoys this.
3,all have same problem,the suction cups just don't hold. Have a larger one in a turtle tank amd figured it was getting knocked loose. put this one in my aquarium for my crabs to have dry land and these don't hold either.
5,Very Cute Panda Costume,This costume runs true to size. Very cute costume. It has a convenient zipper which makes it convenient for the toddlers .Very happy with my purchase.
1,A cowardly director justifies a cowardly act,"Pure garbage. A shameless whitewashing of the obvious guilt of this gutless, savage, cowardly butcher. If you share the shameless cowardice of the filmmaker and his depraved cowardly subject, buy it. If you have a shread of human decency, avoid it.Not knowing what it was, I did buy this garbage, and I did watch it."
4,SUB HUM ANS,"this album is really good because im a subhumans fan and i have all of their albums and i like all their stuff. if youre getting into them dont buy this cd, get any other album by them specially EP-LP, the day the country died, and from the cradle to the grave to start out because theyre good musically and they have good lyrics. then move on to this and worlds apart which has some ska-like songs. then get Citizen Fish albums (citizen fish is 3 guys from subhumans but theyre mostly a ska band)cos theyre alot like subhumans and theyre cool too. once again, this cd is gonna be weird for you if you havent heard very much subhumans but if youre a true fan you'll appreciate it"
4,A Must Get,"This is great music from a very dynamic duo. It is modern with great blend of styles on piano, keyboard and gutar. The singer has great vocal ranges that liven the lyrics, take note when you hear ""But the Bed Was Beautiful"" and ""Refuge"". I hope this Los Angeles based duo continues to serve us more great work."
3,SNOWMAN PENDANT,"The pendant was a gift for a friend. My friend was very pleased and appreciative. Although, I like the pendant I thought from the image that it would be large. But considering the fact that it was sterling silver I was happy.Thank you,Carol Hartnett"
3,Loved it until...,"I have had this griddle for about six years and noticed a few years ago that it appeared to have a little warp but no big deal - still a great griddle. Now, it's warped so badly that much of the surface doesn't lie flat on either burner. Very disappointed, since I bought this item expecting to keep it sort of ""forever""."
5,"Great for the money, check the size","I use this griddle every weekend for pancakes and such. Very heavy and the cirulon non-stick pattern on the griddle really works! I hardly ever use the handles except to put it on or take it off, but the plastic is holding up fine. The circulon pattern allows me to cook pancakes without adding butter to the pan. The little ridges seem to almost float the cooking item above them and there is virtually no stick with anything. However, that same pattern is a little more difficult to clean up later for the same reason. I use a soft brush after soaking, seems to work fine. I have had it for almost a year and its holding up great. Keep in mind it is heavy and gradual preheating is the trick. Also, make sure your stove has the room. Mine just fits. Oh, and if it were 1-1/2 inches wider, it would be perfect."
1,Do not buy!!!,"I bought this item on sale, and followed the directions for use exactly, and after the third time I used this griddle I noticed that the finish was starting to break down in several different spots. I was really disappointed and can not use this item since I am a parrot owner and nonstick surfaces once they start breaking down are lethal to birds.... can not recommend this product to anyone."
3,Good piece of equipment BUT...,"This is a sturdy, well made griddle, BUT it may not fit the stove you intend to use it on. I have tried mine on two stoves now; a standard issue electric range and a Viking gas cooktop. It didn't fit either cooking surface. On the electric range the handle on the rear of the griddle hit the stove's back control panel and prevented the pan from being centered over the burners, so the handle was exposed to the heat of the burner and burnt. On the gas cooktop, it is just plain too short to go between the two burners, so both handles get ""cooked"". It must fit some stoves perfectly. If it fits yours, it is a good piece of cookware. If it doesn't, it's most annoying."
3,Good but far from perfect,"My griddle doesn't fit my stove (Jenn-Air) because of the handle pushing against the back panel. It will probably work better with a drop-in stove, but my griddle is about an inch off center of the burners which doesn't affect cooking but makes one handle hot. Also grooved surface makes cleaning harder and in my experience (I own 3 circulon pans) it doesn't last any longer than regular non-stick surface. I have a Calphalon non-stick pan that was burned numerous times and abused for 5 years now and it is still in a very good condition, but a Circulon pan was ruined after being overheated only once. Of course, they offer a very good deal here and it's worth considering."
4,Happy with Purchase,"This is the first Circulon cookware I've tried. I was afraid the food would get stuck in the grooves but so far it's been great. I've only cooked pancakes, eggs and grilled ham & cheese on it - all with great results. The directions said not to use cooking spray so I hesitantly threw on the eggs expecting them to stick - but they didn't. Cleanup was very easy - the little remaining food came right off when I ran it under hot water. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was because it's a little smaller than I would like - an inch or two wider and an inch longer would be perfect.The griddle arrived a little beat up - two pieces broke off of the plastic that covers one of the handles (the handles are metal with a cool-touch plastic covering). It was packed with air bags instead of popcorn which would have kept it from sliding around in the box.Overall I'm happy with my purchase. I just have to keep my wife away from it with a metal spatula!"
2,Spit Macphee review,"The True story of Spit Macphee is a novel based in the 1930s. The novel revolves around 3 familys The Trees, Macphees and The Arbuckles. Spit Macphee lives with his grandfather Fyfe on the river in a small shack. The two live strange and interesting lives until Mrs Arbuckle changes them completely. About half way through the book Fyfe dies and Spit has to live with the Arbuckles. Spit hates this arrangement and runs away to Pental island. Mrs Tree decides that this is no life for a 11 year old boy and adopts him. Spit has always liked the Tree family so he is very pleased with his new life. I found the book intrigueing in parts but boring and pointless in others. My favourite section in the novel has to be court case because it explains why Fyfe acts like a nut case through out the novel. I recommend this book to anyone over 12 years of age."
3,The True Story Of Spit MacPhee,"Ah, Spit MacPhee, the title automatically captures your attention, doesn't it?? Anyway this story was written by James Aldridge and is basically about the life of the boy Spit MacPhee. The boys grandfather, Fyfe, dies and Spit's future in the hands of two compassionate women, Betty Arbuckle and Grace Tree. This book was enjoyable because the characters, setting and plot was that of a typical Australian tale. It was hard to put down and gives the reader a taste of Australian bush lifestyle. Read it now!! mmmmmmmmkay."
3,What is the book about?,"Spit MacPhee is a young boy who's grandfather just died. Now Grace, a woman who loves Spit , and Betty, a woman who bases her whole life in salvation, want to adopt him. It sure is one of the best books I've ever read!!"
2,The True Story of Spit Macphee- Not for the adventurous,The true story of Spit Macphee is a clever novel. It gives a clear picture of Spit's misfortures but fails to satisfy a need for adventure and drama. I only rated it 2 because I found it quite boring. The only good part of the book is when Old fyfe burns down the house due to the steal plate causing mental pain.The other good point was Betty Arbuckle. She seems to be the biggest snob in a kind way. It seem like she is put on earth to make everyone look bad in comparison to her. She is also quite a hipocrit in her believing of Christ. YOUR WICKED! They were the only recomendable parts in the book thus lifting my expectations of the remainder of the novel.I was honestly disapointed and bored by the end. These are my thoughts of The True Story Of Spit Macphee :p
2,Who adopts the child?,"This book has an ok storyline. Spit MacPhee's grandfather has been killed and two compassionate women both want to adopt this boy. It is easy to read, however, the characters get all confusing and you have to read it a couple of times before you understand the book fully."
2,Defectuoso,"The pants come in time, but it is a defective pants and boots that one of his crooked this defect sewing and was sent to Venezuela.thanks!"
4,George Strait Pants,"I purchased the pants for my dad who is a huge George Strait fan. Although there really isn't anything different between these pants and the other Wranglers, he thought it was great that they ""said"" they were George Strait. The pants were cheaper then any other retail location I had seen and the services I receved through Amazon was as always exactly what it said. I will absolutely make future purcahses through Amazon!"
2,Disappointed,I had had a reawakened interest in well-written historical fiction and ordered this book after reading posted reviews...I must say that I had had a tough time getting through the long-winded and tedious writing...while I find this time period very intriguing I don't think I am going to be able to get very far in The Last Englishman---just the first section on the Battle of Hastings slowed me down so much that I stopped twice...I am a former high school English teacher and not likely to be intimidated by long sentences--but the style of writing just does not work for me...I don't think I am going to be able to finish this novel...
4,The New Syd Barett?,"It sounds as the old Pink Floyd album! Something old but some way new, as a combination of Baroc with Renaissance. It is nice to see the old psyhedelic style trying to fly again. My ears are red! To much onion there!"
4,A great alternative sound!,This disc creates an unusual windstorm of sounds that take you from one genre of music to another so well you'll be checking to see if your cd-changer is on shuffle! Buy this CD and you won't be disappointed!
2,It wasn't the original version,"I was disappointed that this version of ""Over the Rainbow"" wasn't the original version. It was close but no cigar as they say."
2,Not The Originals!!,"These are re-recorded tunes featuring the original lead singer but a whols new line-up of Demensions. It's good music, but if you're expecting the original versions, forget it!"
3,THIS IS A SINGLE...A NICE TRACK FEATURING THE PIPS (YOU KNOW...LIKE IN GLADYS KNIGHT & THE PIPS),"Real enjoyable, nothing over the top, just a real nice pop song. The second song was so-so, your standard pop song...Nothing to write home about, oh! This track does not feature The Pips. The Third is just an Instrumental of the second track...Why?"
3,A GOOD PRANK!,A GREAT JOKE TO PLAY ON FAMILY AND FRIENDS! I PUT ONE ON MY FRIENDS CAR AND WAITED FOR HIM. HE DIDN'T KNOW WE WERE WATCHING. WE WAS FLIPPING OUT! THEY ARE PRETTY FUNNY. I JUST WISH THEY WERE A LITTLE MORE REALISTIC BUT STILL FUN FOR A FEW BUCKS.
3,Meh,"They are a great way to make a point but the fact that they are so little makes them to seem like a ""joke"" before you realize they're a joke. At just a little under 3x5 they seem smallish for an effective prank. If you are looking to make a point with people who do a bad job of parking then this is a great way to send them a ""zinger."""
1,Lame,When I saw parking ticket i was like cool now I can prank the people in my office but when I got them they next day or so I read what it said at the bottom and it was just complete garbage. The pictures sucked before you buy reconsider this product is not for you I promise
1,Teach Yourself Portuguese,"I'm very disappointed with my purchase. The 'complete audio course' consisted of a book marked with a 50 cent label, and there were no CDs or tapes included."
5,Great Album!,This is simply a wonderful album to relax to or to just create a calm meditative mood. The piano playing is very fluid and lyrical. Simply a stunning work that holds up to repeated listenings. A solid 5-Star rating!
3,Why the original is best!,"I have played Unreal (yes, the original) online for three years and have recently begun playing UT2004 online too. I have to admit I prefer the original, though I will continue to play both. UT2004 has some good maps and looks funky, but lacks playability and umph! The weapons are generally dull and uninspiring and the gameplay is slow. No, I don't think it's my PC because I don't lag, just the overall movement seems cumbersome. In Unreal, the original, gameplay requires skill and speed, whereas UT2004 seems to be more about gizmos - knowing the fancy moves and adrenaline etc. Unreal requires more dodging skills in my opinion, at least if you like close quarters combat like I do (as opposed to sniping). I have never played earlier versions of UT, but UT2004 is a disappointment so far. The original is still the best!"
5,Still outrageously fun TODAY!,"This is one of the few games that I still play. I grew up on the Atari 2600, and always hated how weak the graphics were compared to the coin-operated games in the video arcades. A friend gave this to me when it first came out, and I've hardly had time for any other games since. I bought another copy to give to another friend, and now I'm looking to install it on my newest computer. I'll end up buying the latest version of Unreal in the next few months, but as an adjunct to this version, rather than a replacement for it."
5,chaos magick,"I heard about this comic via an online review. I find the subject matter and the whole idea behind Flex Mentallo just very interesting. If you're into adult-oriented, intellectually-stimulating comic books, give this a try."
3,The Fact is...,"I read the A.V. Club's review before picking up Flex Mentallo, so I was warned: This is not a conventional superhero book. This is a dense, dark story about a comic book artist slowly dying of a drug overdose as he reflects on how his works have changed over time. His proudest creation, Flex Mentallo, is a carefree Golden Age superhero out of place in the relentlessly serious comic book landscape of the '90s.There are occasional delights to be found here, but I found the postmodern narrative unsatisfying. This is, after all, a story told by someone who is out of his mind on drugs, full of sound and fury signifying... well, too many things to keep track of. Despite the first-rate talents involved, I can't quite recommend it."
2,An ode to where stories come from and a love of comic books...,"First things first, I read my brother's copy of this which he won. Which turns out is a good thing because I would have been disappointed if I paid for it. Sure Frank Quitely's art is very good and the character designs are really well done. To me though if the story isn't interesting or it doesn't make sense then the good art is a bit of a waste. The story really feels like an ode to where stories come from and a love of comic books. If that sounds odd and confusing, that's exactly how I felt in reading Flex Mentallo. I would say this is probably only for people whom have already read and enjoy Flex Mentallo."
1,Hallucinations from a drug overdose.,"If some of the best music and art is inspired by drugs, then maybe this is a real classic. A comic-book hero has come alive, but so has the villain. Interspersed with Flex's futile efforts to save the world are the comic author's ramblings, childhood memories, and paranoias. Can Flex save the world before the man who dreamed him alive dies of a drug overdose?My pre-teen sons are eyeing this book, asking about it, wanting to read it. Comic books appeal to kids. The topics in this book include drugs, homosexuality, prostitution, suicide, foul language, violence, death, nudity, defecation, hopelessness, atomic warfare... in a format that appeals to children."
1,EC65 DE filter,"I purchased filter on 8-7-2011 and then the filter came, fit like a glove where old model was . I then turn on filter and added the DE as directed . When to my surprise out came Mr .DE . I took filter apart as I have done before,and tighted the bolts as directed . I winterized pool and filter and now after a long winters nap it is leaking again I even changed fingers to no advail. I am pissed ,time is money send me some ."
3,patrik age 1.5,this is a nice movie but i think it should tell you when you look at a movie if its in english or not you should not have to find out after you buy the movie amazon should inform the buyer if its not a english talking movie this is about the 5th one i got that was not in english but i did like the movie its just that i am 60 and its hard to try to read the whole movie
3,this has a double aspect in it for me..,"While I liked the storyline and those acting in it, for me there is very much a feeling of ""yes"" and ""no"" as that wouldnt happen.It was quite moving in the ""reality"" aspect, but when I thought about some aspects, I felt that it lost its credibility.However, all in all I did enjoy it,and as I said to one of my friends, it is after all only a ""story"". Also with such a great story line, I was hoping for some great humour which didnt eventuate."
5,Go for the Subtitles and Enjoy!,"Ok, so you felt like you knew the ending from the start. What an interesting developement as seen from another Country's perspective. A lot of the same prejudice and expectations, but handled really well. Be sure to watch through the final credits...just icing on the cake!"
5,Patrik Age 1.5,"I want to start off with telling you that I hate reading a movie. I would rather understand what is being said instead of reading it. That having been said, I am glad I read this one. I was a bit thrilled by the way the story line played out. I laughed, I cried, I even wanted to watch it again and again. I contemplated not buying this movie at all but now I am glad that I did."
4,Good listening!,"I DJ and was sent a copy of this CD, and well, it's a great CD! I'd strongly suggest that all the goth folk out there get it. Nice addition to any collection."
5,Civil War Buffs,"My son's and I have recently moved to North Carolina and have an interest in the Civil War. These 2 movies are excellently done. The visual and audio effects are both tasteful and artful. One of my son's was studying the Civil War in High School and he enjoyed the movies very much. I would recommend either of these movies to any one, not just Civil War enthusiasts! Pop some pop corn and enjoy these movies with the whole family. However, I would want to watch them first before allowing young viewers to watch them. They are war movies, afterall.Mirl"
5,Terrific !!!,I haven't yet had a chance to watch Gettysburg all the way through but I could watch Gods and General a thousand times and never grow tired of it. The actors in Gods and Generals do a pnenominal job !!!I am in awe everytime I see Stephen Lang's portrayal of Stonewall Jackson.Using the word incredible is an understatement !!! Any positive words used to describe it are understatements.I would recommend to anyone interested in the Civil War to purchase Gods and Generals !!!!
4,Makes you wanna pick up a rifle and charge home!,These movies are great. They give the viewer a great eeling of patriotism and thanks. Giving us all a reason to look back tothe past and salute all the men who died in this terrible war and allowing us to feel what both sides did. I highly recommen these movies and they are worth the time to sit down and watch.
4,Gods and Generals,"I bought Gods and Generals to show to my middle school history class. I found the movie to be a wonderful opportunity to see the real lives behind the names and dates of the Civil War. I was disappointed with the use of bad language, but loved the movie otherwise."
3,"Which General is the ""Real"" Robert E Lee?","A good film, but too much sentimentality. Jeff Daniels did a good job, but with Martin Sheehan as General Lee? What happened to Robert Duval?? Tom Berenger is mis-cast. I would have like to have seen President Lincoln somewhere. Film is not focused enough. But the battle scenes were well done."
1,Gods & Generals,I have had three copies of this video over the last few months and they have not played to the end of the film. Iit is not my Player as I have tried them on two different ones.
5,Civil War Buff,"This DVD has two Stories of the men in the Civil War with empahasis on two in particular: Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain who led a regiment of Maine soldiers for the Union, and Thomas J. ""Stonewall"" Jackson. Chamberlain would survive the War a Hero, while jackson probably the most famous and Heroic of the Confederate generals besides R.E. Lee, did not. These movies try to put a softer face on a brutal war of distinct Ideologies, and succeed to the extent that we do not really know what was said felt and done for what reason. The Battle scenes accurate without the excess of blood flying across the screen as is not necessary to convey the Historic relevence of the story. I thoroughly enjoyed them both."
2,Pickett's Charge?,"I had seen ""Gettysburg"" several years ago, and thoroughly enjoyed it. I watched the DVD as soon as I received it, but was greatly dissapointed that it ended with the battle of Little Round Top. It's incomplete; the original depicted Pickett's charge, etc. This review is about ""Gettysburg"" only; I've yet to watch ""Gods and Generals""."
2,Depiction- good; dialogue-soap opera,"Gods & GeneralsThe staging and costuming is commendable, but the dialogue was syrupy. Almost stilted. Maybe the actors were trying too hard."
3,"Gettysburg is great, Gods and Generals a bore!","I purchased this set because I had enjoyed the movie Gettysburg very much and was excited to see G&G. What an awful film! The characters do not even talk to each other, just stand around and give speaches. ""Oh the horror!"""
2,Tactical vest,Product was enormous in size and had to be returned. We read numerous reviews and info on the product to try and determine size for a middle school boy of an average size. Quality was fine but the vest swallowed him.
5,Classic jacket,"For Heaven-knows-what reason, Harley Davidson has stopped production of its classic ""Shovelhead"" M/C jacket after decades. This is the closest I have seen to it after a ton of looking.The jacket is made of a mid-weight leather, so it can be worn in all but the warmest months comfortably. Three pockets in the torso, coin pocket on the waist and a convenient small pocket on the left wrist.A zip-in liner is included for cooler-wearher riding.Great jacket, great value"
3,Moderate overview of OOP languages and their history.,"This book presents an interesting compilation of OOP languages and their history.I purchased the book to deepen my knowledge of OOP languages - their similarities, differences, origins, strong points, and pitfalls. Although some of the content may be a little ""boring"" (e.g., the painfully detailed history of C++), the book provided a good overview of six different OOP languages (C++, SmallTalk, Ada, Java, Modula3, and Eiffel).I'm not sure how the author selected which OOP languages to cover. It would seem that Object-Pascal (Delphi in particular) was completely overlooked even though it is much more prevelant in commercial implementations than Eiffel or Modula-3. Perhaps losing some of the C++ history and including an overview of additional OOP languages like Delphi would improve the book's usefulness.Bottom-line: good start, but improvements could surely be made."
5,Best book ever!,This must have been the best book ever. Truely something you should buy if you are a true Charmed fan. Don't be fooled by the ugly cover. You will get hypnotized from the first page. Absolutely worth the money! What are you waiting for? Go buy it!
4,Okay book,"The summary of the book sound like the story would be really good. Theres a witch who should recieve her powers when she turns 13, but by a twisted fate they don't turn up. Now the Charmed ones have to solve this problem and a red faced demon.Once I started reading the story it was slow. The plot was thin. I almost just stopped reading it. I have to say that the ending was predictable, but it was enjoyable. I just don't think I'll read the book again anytime soon."
2,not the greatest,"Parts of the book annnoyed me soo much that I just wanted to put it down and never look at it again. I felt like just skipping to the end to spare me the pain of reading it. Why did I read it, you ask? Mainly because I'm a huge fan of Charmed so supporting it helps the show. Other then that...Inherit the Witch is not the best book to read."
2,"Early CO, seen better",This CD sounds like alot of experimental sounds before Coyote Oldman really nailed their core droning sounds as inHouse Made of DawnandThunder Chord. It just does not sound like they hit their core sounds in this CD. Maybe good for it's time and good for those who want a complete CO inventory. But for the type of droning sound at CO's core this is not it.
5,Whatever it Takes,"I love this Cd, It has so much diversity in it, Whatever it takes has so much possibiliy. It has no bindings it is for all cultures.Falling in Love, should be on everyone's Wedding song list and it was on my son's list. Along with another song on this CD.Best Is Yet To Come, goes with my students in our college program, I try to impress upon them that once you get throught this, ""The Best Is Yet To Come"" Thanks Don"
5,Glimpse true compasion and dignity in this book,"Written by Tenzin Gyatso, the Fourteenth Dalai Lama of Tibet. This look inside the mind of the spiritual and temporal leader of Tibet provides the best lesson in human compasion and dignity that I have ever read or seen. I would recommend this book to anyone, anywhere."
5,Amazing book.,Amazing beautiful story of the Dalai Lama's life written by his own self. Everyone must read this book.EVERYONE!!
4,Bought for daughter,"I purchased this for my daughter because she needed it for her English reading in school, she is a junior. The purchase process was simple & deliver of the product was more than I expected! She was worried that it would not be delivered by the estimated they gave us, but it was delivered before the date & that made her so happy! Great service, I will use again & again! Thank you! Oh, & my daughter finds this autobiography outstanding to read & understand, she got a great grade on her 5 page essay about this book!"
2,Amazing person; lousy book,"H.H. the Dalai Lama is an amazing man and his insights are fascinating. If I had 1/2 the compassion and understanding that he has in his little finger, I'd be a better person. However, the book is long and wordy. The gems of insight are hidden in a dense matrix of boring detail."
2,slight and prejudices,"I was not expect a objective writing about the sensitive subject of China-Tibet relationship, however I was appalled and troubled, by some choice words of prejudices on this subject. Apparently, people of all over the world are generally nice, gracious, open and friendly except when it come to Chinese, who can do no right. When they build factories in Tibet, the products produced are intended for China inland, when they build schools, they are intended for learning Mao Tse-Tung doctrine and writing confession, when they build hospitals, no Tibetan can benefit because they only treat Chinese patients with donated Tibetan blood. Building roads are evil too, because Tibetans are under forced labor, except when Tibetan building roads in India refuge camp. Oh, there one part about Chinese eating dead baby too.Only the religions part of writing warrant a extra star."
2,book review,"For the part Ionization potenttial, Electron affinity and electronegativity, there is not a clear precise definition of what those terms means.Mr and Mrs House, please be more careful!!!In general is a good book, but lacks depth in the topics covered"
3,Smaller than you think.,"Great Lodge quality, however I bought this for soup bowls, but it is so small that it is now designated for condiments only."
3,Collection of short texts,"I was strangely disappointed in this book: perhaps, I expected too much of it. But, I was also disappointed in Low's ""Being Right Here"" (a terma text). Despite the impressive list of articles and their authors in this collection of very short Dzogchen texts, it didn't do much for me. Nevertheless, I got some lovely quotes for my collection:""Whatever arises nourishes the naked empty awareness."" p. 110""With the state of the natural made free of all object reliance, one abides exactly as pristine cognition beyond mind: direct naked awareness."" p. 111""When you realize that all the thoughts that occur are the natural energy of the state of the unimpeded condition of awareness, you can remain free of accepting and rejecting."" p. 117""When we speak to other people with an intention or an identification in our mind as to who they are or what they should be doing, that essentially closes the frame of the possibilities of what they can become."" p. 143"
4,St. John's review,I am very satisfied with the book. The book was in very good condition. Thank you very much. I will use this book company again if necessary.Bill Stamps
4,Must Have for every GPS user,It was this book that first convinced me to buy a GPS. We were out 4-wheeling in the Colorado backcountry and met another 4-wheeler. We were looking at his Colorado Atlas and disagreeing at which trail intersection we were at. He pulled out his GPS and said he would settle this. The GPS with the Colorado Atlas proved us both wrong. I went back to town and bought this book and a GPS.
3,"Great Product, Terrible Package","I love this deoderant. It is strong and gentle and perfect for my skin. The prolem is the roll up on this breaks about half the time and you can't use the rest of the bottle. I am still using the the product because I like the deoderant but you would think, for this price, Anthony's could pony up for a workable package."
2,"Win Some, Lose Some","Interesting to see the comment on bad packaging. I am experiencing some ""dial up"" problems on this too. No big deal. My complaint is that the product itself doesn't work for me. Using it guarantees a problem later in the day. Smells good until I use it. Everyone's chemistry is different."
1,Same problems...,I had the same issue with not being able to roll this up. The design seems to be critically flawed. No sense wasting money on this.
2,Limited efficacy,"I've been bouncing from one alternative deodorant to the next for several months now with mild success. The Anthony Logistics alcohol-free deodorant was attractive for its lack of aluminum as an ingredient. Through the initial use I did find that my underarms could tolerate the formula. Other brands have produced adverse skin reactions. Unfortunately, the lackluster performance of the deodorant to actively control and/or eliminate body odor was not encouraging. I could get through midday without any perceptible smell, but after lunch this product would not continue to work as desired. Sadly, I am trying to use up the stick by only applying it when not in the workplace (i.e. weekends). Your mileage with this product may vary. For what it's worth, I will not be purchasing this product again."
5,HEARD IT ON MIAMI RADIO--WOW-- WHAT A HIT THIS IS !!,"I ALREADY WENT AND BOUGHT IT-- PLAY IT ALL THE TIME. FANTASTIC VOCALS, WHAT A BEAUTIFUL VOICE- THE LYRICS ARE GREAT AND THE MUSIC PRODUCTION IS TOPS-- WAIT TILL YOU SEE THE CD-IS SHE EVER SEXY! SHE IS SURE TO BE THE NEXT MADONNA. SHE SHOULD BE VOTED BEST NEW FEMALE VOCALIST!"
5,I love this CD!,"I was just replacing this CD. I bought it years ago... and LOVED it! It is high energy, and my daughter and I put it in, crank up the volume, and it gives us the energy to clean the house - OR to just dance and have fun... Great high energy!"
4,Good Textbook - Hilarious Finds,"I can't imagine anyone buying this outside the purposes of a classroom so my review is going to be based on that assumption.For a textbook, it isn't nearly as dry or boring as most. The material is interesting and to the point, there are good examples, and it is presented in a way that is easy to remember. Also, the book throws in some tidbits that will startle you if you actually do your assigned readings. I almost think that they do it so teachers will know if you have read it ;) for example, they literally use the phrase ""sexy rhinoceros"" at one point and use outrageously silly sexual references. Overall, a good textbook on interpersonal communication."
3,Poor Binding,"After the first class, my book binding starting coming apart so now I have to deal with pages always falling out. It seems like if you are required to spend so much money on a book that it should hold up better."
3,"Good, but not quite Burroughs","If you like the world of Pellucidar (and I do), you will like this. It really is a fun book, and gives insight into Mahar culture. But... Why do the Mayhars seem to be male? Are any of these people related in any way to Zoram, Sari, Amiocap, or any other group described by Burroughs? Of course, Pellucidar is big enough that...Mahars of Pellucidar is good, but not quite Burroughs. I'd like to read the sequel Red Axe sometime."
4,Love's Old Country Music,"This is good but it could have been better. There are 3 songs missing from this CD. Those songs are: PASS ME BY, PlAYIN' HARD TO GET, and BUT LOVE ME. But still HIGHLY RCEMMONDED!!!"
2,Not as helpful as I would've thought -- dvds are better,"We have 7 or 8 Signing Time dvds for our daughter who has Down Syndrome, and they've been great. I thought I'd branch out & try a board book but I was a little disappointed. She is not terribly interested in them...I wish the pictures were different, i.e., more photographs and fewer drawings. It's not always clear from the picture what the sign is. For instance, the page for ""baby"" features a drawing of a carriage, and a photograph of Rachel signing ""baby,"" but no pictures of an actual baby. The page for ""ball"" has a sort of octagon drawing that's not as clear as plain round ball or a beach ball with bright colors would be. I think the dvds are great and maybe the later books are better but this one was just so-so. I'd say it's not worth the price."
5,Highly Recommend This Series of 3 Books,I bought this series of 3 books for my son who was learning sign language because he was speech delayed. It was a huge help to everyone in the family and gave my son a method to communicate which alleviated some of his frustration. I highly recommend all 3 books in the series for any parent going through what we were going through.
1,Not enough information,Amazon does not publish basic details on this title to determine its current information value. Five more words to get out of this review.
4,Good for a personal profile,"If you wish to have a decent look at the opinions of a man who has become, increasingly, a thorn in the side of the U.S. government, this is an excellent book. The author basically presents the viewpoint of Hugo Chavez as gathered in interviews with little or no editorializing. As such, it provides a fair explanation for some of his actions, his distrust of the U.S. and other economic powers, and his visions for the future of Venezuela. Through this book you can get a sense for the ability Chavez has to relate to people, particularly poor people in his own country, and gain some understanding of the reasons for his popularity. I would highly recommend reading other books that present opposing viewpoints, however, since some of what's presented is obviously affected by Chavez's rose-colored glasses."

3,CHOO-CHOO!,"The kids got a real kick out of this little puzzle.However... it's really annoying. The train sound goes off ALL the time, not just when the last piece is inserted.I put the toy away on a shelf and everytime someone walks past, jostling it ever so slightly, it Choo-Choos.Also, every time I open or shut the door to the room, it Choo-Choos.Also, every time I turn on or off the overhead light in the room (oddly enough), it Choo-Choos.And this is after seperating the pieces from the board by putting them in seperate bags in seperate rooms.But like I said, the kids love it... and my fiance has a good sense of humor about it always going off when nobody's playing with it. He thinks it's funny. I'm wondering how long it'll take the batteries to die.:)"
1,Will make sound unexpectedly,"This puzzle looks and feels sturdy. However, it will sound unexpectedly even when the puzzle is not in place. Sometimes it will give you a creepy feel because of it. Mine will sound especially when I turn my lights off (even without all the puzzle pieces in place!). Sometimes it will sound when I walk by it. On the other hand, it won't sound even after I put the puzzle together 5 out of 10 times. I won't recommend it."
2,Hit or miss sound,"I'm unsure when the sound is supposed to come on because it is so random i can only describe it is hit or miss sound. Not every piece makes sound when it goes into the right place, sometimes 2nd or 3rd piece makes sound. Sometimes if i take one piece out and put it back again makes the sound. Sometimes if i wiggle the piece it makes the sound. I kept it cuz it still makes sound at least once while all the pieces are put in the correct places and my son enjoys playing with it but too random sound that is unpredictable."
1,Trashy,"This toy looks great, puzzles great, but the screw they used is of such poor quality that we can't open the battery compartment. This thing is going back to the store we bought it at tonight.This is very unexpected from Melissa and Doug, a brand that sells at a premium because of it's reputation for high quality."
5,Fun Puzzle!,"What a fun idea! This is the first puzzle I've had that makes noise. My twins are only 16 months old, so they are just learning to play with it, but they enjoy it so far. It makes a great train sound when the final piece is placed. We have not had any issues with the sound.If you are not familiar with Melissa and Doug puzzles, I don't know how you could be disappointed! The wood puzzles are sturdy, pieces are chunky, and so cute and colorful - they're the best! I'm looking for more! :)"
5,Great Sound Puzzle,"Unlike some sound puzzles, this has great sound quality. It doesn't matter what order you do this puzzle in, the train sound still occurs with the placement of the last piece. I would recommend this to any train or puzzle lover. It is great for all young children in my opinion. The best part is that the sounds are realistic."
3,Poor puzzle that didn't sway my train loving son,"This puzzle is awful. First of all the back part of the train is the same color and style asthe puzzle pieces so it's very difficult to SEE as you're putting it together. it would have been much better had the background been sligtly off in color, and faded perhaps. The choo choo sound is barely audible and for about 5 seconds. by the time you realize what you're hearing the sound is gone!my son LOVES trains. He's 2 and his first word in the morning and his last word at night is choo choo, or Toby (as in thomas and the Tank Engine) and he wasn't excited at all about this toy. I thought maybe he'd get used to it and come around but no, it's not something he wants to play with at all.Give this a miss. It's so not worth it!EDIT: Over time my son has come to enjoy this toy. It's unique, he smiles when he's able to put it together and he generally enjoys it. I still think it could be better but it's not as dire as my above review first describes."
2,Cursory Overview,"This book provides an overview of the concept of radiant floor heating (RFH) systems. Although there is useful information provided in the book, it is lacking for useful design tools. Those who are adept at surfing the web are likely to find as much information about RFH from a couple of hours of searching than is contained within this book. Certainly not written for professionals, the text is at times poorly written and somewhat repetitive. I recommend that interested home owners consider the books on RFH by Siegenthaler (Modern Hydronic Heating....) and Holohan (Hydronic Radiant Heating)."
1,Dimly radiant,"This one of the worst books I have ever purchased. It does not provide ""real answers contractors need"" as is advertized on the cover. The information provided is mainly taken from web pages and other vendor supplied information. Many repetitions of the limited material as if the author had prepared several drafts and included them all in the published version. Don't waste your money.-Ag"
1,For beginners only.,There are much better books for the those of us who are really technically oriented. I would buy this for my mother.:-)
1,This book is a waste of your time and money,"McGraw-Hill should be ashamed of themselves for allowing this book to be published! It meets none of the advertized criteria, and you couldn't begin to attempt a design or purchase after having read this thinly disguised manufacturer's sales pitch. There's better information available on the web for free. What's more the writing style is extremely superficial and repetitive, with identical illustrations used in numerous places simply as fillers. The author (if really an actual person) should go into hiding immediately.The publisher's ""text book"" reputation really deserves to be tarnished if this is the best they can come up with.Do not buy this book!"
1,where's the beef,"Really not much info in this for it's size. It's the type of booksomeone would get if they wanted to get radiant heating, didn'tknow anything about it, and were going to hire a contractor toput it in. This way, they could at least use the right wordsdescribing things.Surprisingly, it's the only book 2 local bookstores had instock on radiant heating.Modern Hydronic Heating by Siegenthaler had much more info, background,designs, etc."
1,Awful book,"Other reviews are willing to go to more effort than I for this banal, repetitive bit of trash. I have the hardback displaying a $49.00 list price. Sick."
1,Do Not buy this book,This book is very disappointing. It contains little specific material but offers mostly generalities. It is not a How To book as it will not teach you to do enough to design and install a system. the illistrations are very poor. Do not waste your money on this book as I did.
1,Not very reliable,"I've had a Hammer external Hard drive for about 15 months, and I only turned it on when I did a backup -- for maybe 20 minutes or so, once or twice a month.The drive has now completely died without any warning. It just started one day all by itself and I am unable to access any data -- just great as a backup drive, right ??The previous comment that ""as long as you don't keep it running all the time it's probably good for at least a year"" says it all. Is that what you want in a backup drive -- good for about a year ??"
4,Fun while it lasted,"With a enjoyable single player campaign, Dungeon Siege is a solid game, but sadly is rather hadicapped. The campaign is far too short, rather simple, and not very replayable. Multiplayer is extremely lacking, needing a centralized server to be of any use."
3,Fun but not Baldur's Gate,This game ran ok for me on an iMAC 400DV G3with 320RAM even though the box says you need a 450. The game was to linear for me. It was fun but not enough interaction between players and NPCs. There was one particular way of doing everything with no alternatives. The Baldur's Gate series was much more to my liking.
4,"Very good game, but disappointing for me.","Yes, there's a lot that's good and impressive about this game. The graphics and sound are excellent. The gameplay is intuitive and easy to master. Comparing this game to the older game Diablo II, it certainly has some enhancements compared to Diablo II. The graphics are better, and you can move the camera angle around. You can command several characters, and build their skills however you like. But its hack and slash, minimal-strategy gameplay is equivalent to that of Diablo II. I've played it for several hours, and have not been impressed. I was hoping for and expecting a game that would take this type of game to a new level. But it doesn't achieve that. There's nothing groundbreaking or revolutionary here. Very linear storyline and gameplay."
1,Shit happens,"Cannot use this game on my mac. Tells me there's an error in the library, I tried different solutions without success. I felt like a child with the broken toy. Depressed... My fault? Game fault? Mac fault? I gave up for a bit but I need to get back on it."
1,Dungeon Siege MAC,"If you own a MAC computer do not order this game! While the game appeared to install ok,j when I try to play it, it does not recognize a mouse. I have e-mailed the developer, but never received a response from them. I feel as though I have been burned. I have played this game on a PC with no problems."
1,"did not work, unable to return item","The game did not work on my computer, and I sent message to seller, but never received info on returning product - so I am out $$$. I do not recommend this seller."
5,A thinking persons Animal rights book,"I almost didn't buy this book because I was put off by it's cover. It just looked outdated.But I own just about everything written about animal rights so I picked it up to add to my library.It has turned out to be one of my favorite books because it's beautifully written with excellent logic.If you have ever had difficulty explaining your position on an animal rights issue, to a non-animal person, read this book.And then read it again.A perfect blend of logic, ethics and moral behavior."
3,Good not great,Worth Ray did an okay job of research; not as good as other research books by him. The printing is blurred on several pages.
2,There are a lot better calendars out there!,"My biggest problem was it does not have enough months. My daughter was born at the end of the month, so on a page labeled ""Seventh Month"" I was puuting the ""Sixth months old"" sticker on. So when we got to The last page of the calendar, she was only 11 months, so no pages were left for birthday memories. I was quite disappointed in this purchase! There are also only stickers for 3,6,9, and 12 months old, not every month like some calenders. And the pictures are a little strange. One has like purple and black jesters. The cover one was my favorite, but if I would have seen the inside, I would not have picked it."
1,absolutely worthless,"I have had this book for many years, and never actually found any useful information, not one time. Granted, there is a lot of material in there, but there isn't enough space to properly cover any individual topic (it doesn't even have enough tables, or quick-reference data), so the user would do well to look for the info elsewhere (in a proper book).As a general rule, I now stay away from all of Mr. Whitaker's ""books"", he seems to have better editorial skills than technical ones, and he always manages to get a lot of garbage published (with catchy titles). Speaking of garbage, a couple of weeks ago I took this (heavy) book to its final resting place (the dumpster), I did not even want to sell it. I don't mean to be vicious, I have seen the good reviews, but I don't think they are warranted."
4,this a useful handbook,"Unlike some of the other readers, I found this book very informative. Perhaps this depends on your own background and what you are looking for in this book. I am not an engineer but with a physics background and working on an experiment project, I found this book very useful. Indeed it is the most informative source I have found so far, except for the wiki, because it covers a lot of areas in brief articles, allowing you to know about the existence of various technologies and some of the key issues involved. Once you are aware of these technologies or issues, then it is relatively easy to find more in depth literature on the subject, but otherwise I might have not been aware of them. Alas, 15 years have passed, we do not have a similar but newer book, what a pity."
5,Comedy classic,A very worthwhile piece of literature which belongs in any library of comedy or television. It chronicals the history of one of the best and most inventive events in TV history. The book is more the history of the show than the humor but it does contain lots of the wit and the flavor.. Now I want a book of the jokes with photos. Good work.. Buy it.
5,My favorite harmonica,"The Lee Oskar has become my favorite harmonica, specifically this one in low F. Magnificent sound and very easy to play. I have played more than 15 different harmonicas and this particular brand and low F key is the best of them all. Highly recommend. If a reed goes on this one I would immediatelyreplace the whole instrument. Only costs about $30, which is a bargain for this wonderful harp. Thank you Lee Oskar."
5,So glad you have this!,"I have been looking for this book for years! It is a wonderfully detailed biography about a very fascinating person of whom little is written in books.. Mr. Snyder's bibliography is almost all from contemporary accounts of Mary Walker's life. I was afraid Mary Walker was in danger of being lost to history, but am so glad the book is available! She emerges from the book as a wonderfully complex individual who ""did her own thing"" long before it was really possible for women.... idealistic on the one hand and impossibly hard to get along with on the other! One of the first women doctors, Civil War heroine, women's dress reformer, published author, on the public speaking circuit in Europe and the US.... and sometimes she DOES sound like a bit of a crank, bless her heart! As far as I know, this is the most comprehensive book on her life, a life that deserves to be remembered!"
5,Very Thorough!,"Snyder's book is the defining literature on Mary Walker. Any article or book subsequent to this publication reference it heavily. It is unfortunate that there are not more books about this revolutionary feminist, but Snyder presents a well-balanced look at her life. Unfortunately, he does not spend a lot of time examining her Civil War work, nor her numerous publications, but tends to concentrate more on her post War life."
1,Viewing Problems,"Though I'm a fan of anything Star Trek, these files do not play at full screen. It appears in a small square in the center of 1/4th the screen. There are no instructions or options to play at full screen."
4,Great item to own,"This is one of the best blu-rays you can buy. I enjoyed the disc quality and of course the show itself. The only complaint I have is the 1080 up-convert of the excellent Star Trek: DS9 episode ""Trials and Tribble-ations"". Although I understand the limits of this episode being produced at 480p resolution I feel Paramount could have produced a better up-conversion to 1080p. It appears to me that it is actually a 1080i conversion. Way to many jagged lines appear. Of course if Paramount were smarter they would have completely remastered this episode as well. It would have been a excellent way to test the response of the buying public. But everything else on the set is great. I grew up watching Star Trek and this is a most own set."
4,Star Trek: The Trouble With Tribbles,We love watching this but actually we watch it on MSN/TV and Joost but still watch our version when commercials get too repetitive.
5,Kudos to the great space explorers,"Although I would never pay this kind of money, I have torecognize the fabulous Star Trek, a show that was light yearsahead of the rest of T.V. in it's philosophy and moral vision.Although it's all true about the special effects, costumes, and over-acting; this show had heart and soul and provided space fantasy, science (or the semblance of), and creativity for us trapped in the 4-5 channel world of tv existence in the mid-80s. Long live the voyagers and seekers."
3,Star Trek Original Series Season Two [Blu-Ray],"Not as disappointed as when I got Season One, but still disappointed in this box set. After Season One, I had hoped an annoying technical glitch would have been fixed, but alas, no. As in Season One, there is an annoying glitch where suddenly the scene stops and it skips backwards to start it over. In Season Two it skips backwards only about a minute in time, whereas in the Season One discs it skips back 10 minutes or so.I also wish each disc had an option to choose an episode and go straight to it. Instead you are required to view them in chronological order. So if you want to view the third episode on the disc, you have to fast forward through the first two.When I get around to purchasing Season Three, I will go back to the standard DVD and hopefully avoid the Blu-Ray glitches."
5,Star Trek The Original Series - The Complete Second Season (Remastered),Star Trek The Original Series - The Complete Second Season (Remastered)We LOVE it!! Fabulous job remastering! I would highly recommend it to Trekkies and non-Trekkies alike.
5,Greatly Enjoyed,This product is a must have for any fan of Star Trek. The remastered episodes are great and really bring the original series to a whole new level of enjoyment. The price was great too. It was significantly lower then the price I've seen at Best Buy and other stores.
4,Un box Revisited,"This Amazon unbox is not fully developed or has a lot of bugs in it. They should pull it until they get the bugs ironed out. Could not download all of the movie i ordered and now it is gone from my computer and I don't see how to download it again.Update: Most of the problems I experienced were with my Sattelite connection. After 175 MB they start to throttle the speed way down. I upgraded and this helped. I can now download large movies but only in 350mb bites each 4 hours. If you are having trouble read your sattelite ""fair access"" policy."
1,Truth in advertising,although amazon was quick to respond with a replacement....it was the same thing. PhotoStar Trek: The Original Series - Season Two [Blu-ray] shows cardbord sleeve on product. It does not come with it. If you were collecting these look elsewhere for the complete product. Otherwise it works fine.
1,"Preserve, restore, don't alter!","I am okay with modern visual effects, good or bad, but don't alter what was... I want things on blue-ray or DVD but I want to see them as they were, even if they are laughable. Restore and preserve past television shows and movies, remake or ""re-imagine"" them, but don't alter old shows and movies. At least give me the original as an option. In case you wondered the CGI replacement scenes in these aren't always very good."
1,I never received the item,"I suppose that TOS (Series II) is a good watch. But, I wouldn't know for sure because I never received the item from the seller. And, he/she said that they would refund my money, but have yet to do so. That was a week ago (Jan 14), well over a month ago when I bought the item (about two weeks before Christmas).Oh well. Let the buyer beware!"
1,INCOMPLETE!,It was sold as a set of three -- was a Xmas gift & the 3rd DVD wasn't to ship till after Xmas -- so I cancelled the order! This is the second time this has happened to me -- the last time I ordered in March for an Easter gift and I rec'd the shipment in NOVEMEBER! I am very UNHAPPY!
2,Not the best Season Two Episode,"Though my family and I love watching the Original Series episodes, this one's story was pretty lame. I kinda thought the same about Trouble with Tribbles, but my kids laughed hysterically at that one. My 18 year old daughter thinks Kirk rules."
5,The Original!,Nothing beats the original. I love the fact that I can watch these great shows without having to fork out a couple of bucks every time.
2,Star Trek The Origial Series Remastered Season 2,"I bought this remastered season of star trek and I think it's really good excellent work, however I did see a few mistakes paramount made on the episode ""Assignment Earth"" the control room scene is fuzzy with static were they forgot to digitally clean it up and there was some view screen scenes where you can see black specks and a scene where the elevator is going up the rocket and you can see mud on the camera."
5,good service,This is a great set the vidio is excellent. I bought seson 2 & 3 on sale season 2 did arrive with a broken case. amazon gave me a 10 dollar credit I wont be able to replace this 6 disk case but i can live with it .
5,Beam Me Up,I love watching the Star Trek Series on large television screens and the new special effects that were added on to blueray. It is definitely worth purchasing.
5,Star Trek boldly went where tv had not gone before...,"A must-have for Trekkers! At last we're given some of this series' best - The whacked-out Spock in rut in ""Amok Time"", the annoyingly and unbearably cute (until the Ewoks came along, of course)Tribbles, Who Mourns for Adonais? and Mirror Mirror, just to name a few. Yeah, so the special effects are dated and cheesy looking in the 21st century. Who gives a flip? It was a great series and finally we have our fix. Rest in peace DeForrest Kelley and blessings and hopes for a cure for James Doohan. You live on on DVD"
4,"Fantastic ""makeover""!","A beautiful remastering work, although some of the episodes look quite tacky today. Anyway it's still a lot of fun and my friends and I loved watching this timeless sci-fi series again. The only technical ""flaw"" we found were the closed-captions which in many instances cut out a few letters at end of the lines, although it really didn't affect our understanding of the dialog, as we all understand English quite well (however, I don't know if could be a problem for those who actually have hearing impairment)"
4,Glorious DVD transfer--extras fall short,"As good as season 1 is, season 2 of Star Trek, the Original Series, tops it. There are only a few ""average"" scripts; mostly really shine, especially when compared to ""Voyager"" or,(ugh) ""Enterprise"".Yes, great acting, clever direction, stellar (no pun intended) scripts...and all done in 1967-68. Waaaaay ahead of its TV time.However, the extras on this set leave MUCH to be desired. Come on, ""Seinfeld"", one of TV's groundbreaking comedies, has commentary on every episode--Star Trek, unquestionably TV's most influential sci-fi series--deserves at LEAST as much respect from its parent company."
2,Not on HD-DVD,"It is indeed poor business practice for Paramount to abandon the HD-DVD version of this series, as, for some of us, it was the only reason we bought the HD-DVD players in the first place. I'm sure it would look much better in HD.Agree with others that the package is not so good either. The hinge and latch are hard to close, especially if the discs aren't perfectly placed in the case.I'm glad they went to the trouble to remaster them. It's just too bad you can't really enjoy the better master quality in HD."
3,What?,"Again, CBS video was asleep at the wheel when this was made. Not in broadcast order. Have to jump from disc to disc to what in order. A real moronic series."
1,Amazon problems with downloads - never resolved.,"I tried downloading this when the service started by usingthe free tokens. It never downloaded, and with severalemails with tech reps who could not resolve the issueI was ""blown off"" because I did not spend ""real money"" onthe download. (""Oh it didn't really cost you anything. . ."")I will never try this service again! (and it has been since thento show my resolve)"
1,Remastered high definion + complete commentaries on the way?,"First fans after a long wait purchased one-episode-per-VHS tape.Then they remastered them and re-sold them again as definitive prints suitable for the serious fan.Then fans purchased what the studio said was a digital version for lifetime enjoyment on the 12"" laser disc format (2 episodes per LD)Then after the industry dumped LD's and the studios released them on DVD at 2 per disc.Now Paramount is again releasing them, this time in boxed Season sets at an unheard of price.Just a word of warning...Star Trek's 40th anniversary is coming up...and I'm willing to bet they will be remastered in high definition WITH meaningful complete commentaries on every episode.So once everyone has a copy of these boxed season sets sold at a high price I bet paramount will release the complete series as a single boxed set (after all there are only 3 season) cheaper than the 3 invidual boxed sets."
3,Not the remastered version,"Despite what the title says, this is not the remastered version of ""Obsession."" For some reason, both Amazon and Netflix do not show the remastered version of this episode. The video quality is not on par with the other remastered episodes, and the updated special effects are not evident (including a better CGI version of the creature and a massive blast crater on the planet as the Enterprise leaves orbit)."
5,Cleans up nicely!,"If you don't mind new SFX on principal, this set is wonderful. Despite the fact that this is a regular DVD, the image and integration with the new SFX is something really nice to behold. And I actually zoom in on the 4x3 frame on my 42"" hdtv and enjoy it big screen. Just use a better upconverting player and you're set. Blu-Ray would, of course, be the best, but believe me, the plain old DVDs look better than TOS ever looked on analog broadcast or cable.And upon seeing these episodes again, one may just realize that they have forgotten how great the Original Series was."
5,A fresh look,"I know the focus is on the special effects, but I am excited just to see the complete stories again. I watched these episodes as a boy when they first came out and over and over again in syndication. I read in one of the Gerrold books that local engineers would shorten scenes to make more time in the hour for advertisements. There is more backstory depth in Mudd's Women that I hadn't seen in years, and a bridge officer that I had completely forgotten."
4,both sides now,"Last year I bought saison 1+2+3 of STAR TREK TOS - digitalized - on DVD. I was not jumping to buy the 3 boxes, again, on BLU-RAY ... until I discovered that ... the discs contain not only the digitalized, but also the NOT digitalized versions of every episode ... I wanted to buy the 3 DVD boxes, older editions, to complete my collection ... which is not nessecary now I bought STAR TREK TOS on BLU-RAY ..."
5,Star Trek: Season 2,"Perhaps the best season of the best show ever produced for television, season 2 offers some of the finest episodes of the entire series including: AMOK TIME, A PRIVATE LITTLE WAR, THE CHANGELING, THE DOOMSDAY MACHINE, WOLF IN THE FOLD among many others. A classic show for fans of intelligent television of any age."
3,Season 2 problems with Panasonic DMP-BD10A,"I wish I could review this Star Trek: Season 2, But my Panasonic BD-10A player will NOT play it. Seasons 1 & 3 plays just fine and they are both great productions. There is a blog going about this problem below. I would like to know, what Blu-Ray Players all of you used to watch this Season 2? That would be most heplful in choosing a new BD Player. Thanks.2/9/2010 - I just bought a new Panasonic Blu-Ray Player BD-60 and it plays Season 2 without any problems. Good-bye BD-10A."
5,Solid buy...go for it Trek fans...,First off this is obviously priced better than the previous HD/Combo season...so that is a major plus.There are many fan favorite episodes here as well as a ton of extras. Totally worth it.
3,Cracked and Broken,When I opened the package the back of the plastic box was broken.....when I opened the box inside the plastic circle which keeps the DVD's in place was also broken so the DVD's dont stay in the box..........I guess the US mail could have mishandled it but I was very disappointed that the inside was broken like the outside...so far the DVD's work non are broken
5,Star Trek is awesome,"The original Star Trek series was my favorite television show growing up, and I was generally pleased with the second season I recently purchased. My only disappointment was with how the different episodes are formatted in this series. Rather than allowing the viewer to watch all of the episodes on a given disk in continuous order, you have to select and view each episode individually. When an episode is over, you are brought to a main menu that has to be navigated each time, which is annoying. But the purchase was still well worth it."
1,Failed repeatedly,"This service has yet to work for me. Constantly get ""Insufficient license"" message. In any case, most of these shows can be found on cable tv for free anyway."
3,Remasterd standard DVD better,"I have found this blue-ray version to be grainy at best. Maybe, it's my 32inch Sony, but I have the remastered standard version, and that plays better and cleaner.Rod."
1,It's Star Trek But not Star Trek,The quality was good but the new CGI effects DO NOT mesh well with the old footage. I don't like updated effect in old series. In fact a lot of the shots look worse with the CGI. Either go for the Blu ray edition with both the original and remastered video or try to find the older DVD's if you are a purest like me.
1,Waiting for Blu-ray,"Having already bought the DVD season sets as they came out (also having bought most of the original two-ep DVDs), and saving my favorite remastered eps on my DVR, I am waiting this time for Blu-ray.Count me among those disturbed that CBS/Paramount isn't offering Blu-ray in this and the scheduled third season release -- it feels like gouging the fans, and I am not going along. You know they will release this in Blu-ray, it's just a question of when, and it will be sooner than later.Although I like the new effects (as a die-hard fan since about '70) and have enjoyed the quality of the remastered live-action footage, it's not enough to make me buy another standard-def second season just for them.My one-star rating is based on five stars for the series, minus four stars for not being on Blu-ray."
2,lousy collectors case for star trek season one,i was excited to get my star trek original series season one . until i opened it and saw what a lousy and cheaply constructed collectors case. the dvds are stacked on top of each other in separate disc holders . which i almost broke one dvd trying to remove one from the holder which is hard to remove . i expected at least separate casing for better storage of my dvds. like the honeymooners individual casing for each dvd disc which is perfect. hey mr case inventor next put the dvds in a paper bag .cause it's not much different from the crap star trek casing u came up with. yours truly very dissapointed
1,TAKE A PASS UNTIL A BLU-RAY COMES ALONG!!,"There should have been a Blju-Ray of this is the studio had any respect for the fans, who hugely overpaid for the fiasco first season on HD-DVD. PLEASE teach the studio a lesson and DON'T BUY this until a Blu-Ray version gets issued - as it should have been simultaneously with this."
3,Don't Expect Collector's Condition,"Star Trek The Original Series - The Complete Second Season (Remastered)The shows are great, but don't expect a collector-quality product in the mail. Amazon fails to pack it properly and the plastic case is easily shattered where the two halves come together. That's not a big deal if you're just looking for the DVDs to watch, but if you wanted a collector's item that could increase in value over the years, this is not the way to go."
4,Fantastic Job with the Remaster,"A really nice job was done on the film to get all the imperfections out of the film - dust, blank spots, lines, etc. The new shots of the ships and planets are wonderful. They didn't go overboard with it and did a remarkably tasteful job. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars, is the trailers were not remastered. This still is my favorite show of all time. I've been watching Star Trek since about 1976, and it never gets old. It's amazing how the stories have held up this long."
3,Had to buy it for Class,"It's one of the text-book requirments I had for my computing class. It works, but... buy the used ones if possbile."
3,Not very good for coding,"Although this book has a lot of pertinent information to engineers, I bought it with the intent of learning the fundamentals of coding in MATLAB. I have a class in which our teacher assigns problems in MATLAB, but none of the students have experience in MATLAB. I bought the book to help me figure out how to write codes and it doesn't do that too well, but I could see how it might work well for someone familiar with MATLAB who needs to use it for an engineering problems."
4,They work just fine,"These are meant to go on the inside of your rim. The best way to put them in is to put them on your presta valve first, then put them into the hole. That way they won't push through. They are a good fit and should help protect your inner tube from the mythical ""schrader hole blowout."""
4,The Shortest Kid in the World,This book was a little girl named Emily and how she was the shortest kid in her class. She began to hate being small because her family and classmates always teased her. And then one day a new girl named Marietta comes to Emily's class and she is now the shortest kid in the class. The lesson that this book teaches is just to be happy with the way you are and the way you look. The age level of this book is about from ages 5-8. I thought this book was good because it teaches an important lesson that all children need to learn.
5,Kids book,This was an excellent purchase experience - product good - seller did as expected - good value - would deal again. Well received as gift.
4,Bye Bye Boyfriend,"Ashley wants to be in the school play ""Bye Bye Birdie"" and play the main girl role, but instead Mary-Kate gets the part and gets to kiss Ashley's biggest crush, Ross Lambert. Read this book and you'll love it, guaranteed!I thought that this book was good, but I like all the MK&A books!"
5,TG fan,"Great live recording from the one true original pioneer of industrial music. 100% assault on your senses, this is truely an amazing document of TG's might and sonic power. The sound quality on this cd is excellent.If you are in a budget and can't afford the expensive box set, the TG Live series is a an excellent buy for fans old and new. Collect them, I have, it's all worth it."
5,outstanding from top to bottom,"Many of the people who first pick up this album now will miss the point: Those looking for the radio-ready stuff of Rob Zombie's solo albums won't find it here. Instead, we have one of the most singular releases of the '90s. Horror-movie soundbites are spliced flawlessly with tempo-changing, well-constructed songs from beginning to end, creating a true ALBUM -- not just a collection of songs. My first listen to La Sexorcisto in 1993 was a great experience: unpredictable, exciting and thoroughly rewarding. Here's hoping someone who's just picking this up for the first time can still enjoy it that way."
5,Either Im in heaven or I went straight to hell,"Theres only a few things you can say about La Sexorcisto. One is, ""These people are going to hell! Damn their vile creations!"" The other response to this is ""These people are going straight to hell. TAKE ME WITH YOU!"" While these may seem extreme, they still show the diversied responses to this album. The more squeamish people will hate it, while the metal heads will love the pounding bass and the twisted lyrics. White Zombie is good at what they do, and thats hitting hard and heavy with a sound that no others have come close to so far. I have to say this is by far my favorite album overall. And I have no reservation recommending this unless your just a total dickless wonder <G>"
3,All sound the same.,I got this after AStrocreep so thats why it has a low rating when i compare both these cds Astro has more innovation between songs while La Sexocisto sounds the same from song to song. Well since it is their first record you can't blame them i guess.
4,good but......,"This is a good cd but i personally think that Astro Creep 2000 is a way better album. Its catchier and its heavier. The best song on the cd is Thunder Kiss 65' and Soul Crusher, especially the intro. All in all it was a good album."
5,Awesome,"Wow. This cd is definately amazing from beginning to end. It is one of the best metal discs out there, it is a perfect example of good, hard and heavy, old fashioned head bangin' music! The guitars leave your head spinning, the bass riffs are totally awesome, and I can't say enough about Ivan's phenomenal beats. He is one of the best drummers I have ever heard, and I have very high standards being a drummer myself. He has awesome time, excellent fills, and just when you expect one thing, he throws a curve ball such as a vicious double bass attack. The drums alone really give the cd a flavor all its own. I reccomend this cd to any drummers out there tired of hearing these average talent guys going pro."
2,Good songs; bad production,"I hate it when I get into a band later in their career and then track back to the first album, because they usually get worse the farther back you go. This is the case with Rob Zombie, but I can't fault him for how horrible this CD sounds. Whoever produced and/or engineered this album missed the point of a metal band: make it LOUD! Listen to Astro-Creep: 2000 or Hellbilly Deluxe and you get a thick, sonic blast of an experience; listen to La Sexorcisto and it's like listening to Alice Cooper on quaaludes. Overall, the tunes are catchy, but the quality of the recording detracts from what this album could have been."
5,IT WAS ALL DOWN HILL AFTER THIS ALBUM,"This is best album that zombie put out.It is one of my must have albums all the songs are excellent especialy welcome to planet Mf, Black Sunshine, With cool background vocals by iggy pop and I am legend. after this album everything turned into a bunch of alike sounding peices of techno metal stuff that has gotten even worse with rob zombie's solo stuff as if that was possible. So Buy This one and forget the rest unless you like techno metal stuff..."
3,Average cd yet listenable,This cd has it's up moments more than it's down moments yet it just gets boring after listening to the same repetitive bass lines and guitar riffs. I'm a big fan of White Zombie and I know they can do better than this and they showed that by producing Astro-Creep 2000 and Hellbilly Deluxe. And also their newest release is pretty darn good! Plus the production of the cd is just God awful!!! Well this cd has potential yet it just goes flat after awhile of listening to it.
1,this cd is bad,i'm a white zombie fan and this cd is the biggest piece of trash i have ever heard don't listen to these morons who reviewed it earlier just get astro-creep 2000 and save yourself some time
3,A good rockin' CD,"It's nice to see some new,straight-forward, old school type metal in today's scene of Alternative, trendy crap. Although not the most talented band, the CD is still full of good songs."
3,not bad for a bunch of dead people,"white zombie are all about groove and nothing grooves more than thunderkiss 1965 but this whole album is all about the rhythm and groove more than any record i own. sean yseult is one awesome bass player and she holds the fort down along with drummer Ivan. how can we forget J, one of the most underrated guitar players to come along and helped set the style for nu-metal.there are some fun songs here. zombie are not to be taken too seriously. this music rocks and asks to be cranked up to eleven as you crack a cold one and settle down on the couch. heavy and silly. they combine clips of dialogue along with music, stuff from star trek, night of the living dead and others. zombie combines many styles such as horror movies with metal/industrial to serve up one great record."
5,"No track skipping, 6 stars to be honest...","Just came across this cd, apparently a bit too late. Pure power pop perfection, jangly edgy guitars, nice melodies with clever lyrics and hooky choruses. Great for listening on the road, psyching up for a surf, driving, chilling out, one of those cds that puts a smile in your face, no matter what. The singer's voice is pretty good, soft yet powerful, no whining, good harmonized backing vocals and all.A bit like a Gin Blossoms with less twang and more overdrive, better comparisons welcome. Super-catchy rockers and heart-wrenching ballads.Hard to pick a favourite track but ""Disappear"", ""Peek"", ""Antenna"" and ""Hello, Love"" are brilliant. Wonder what the hell happened to this band? Definitely should've gone big.."
3,mixture of feelings,"I can imagine that buyers of this CD have mixed feelings about this record. For the hardcore jazz lovers, this CD will be to much 'middle of the road'. For me however, although I think of myself as a jazz freak, this CD gave me much pleasure. The harmonic lines are brilliant and the songs are wel built up and for me the drummer (young Chris Dave) is one of the best hardhitters today. To compare this CD with Kenny G is not appropriate, but I have to admit it is not one of his best work. In the end, you have to see Kenny live anyway."
4,Give Kenny a break,"Even though I've enjoyed Kenny Garrett's CDs ""Songbook"" and ""Pursuance,"" I almost was scared away from this one by the negative reviews here. Happily, I had the opportunity to see Kenny in concert last night, which put my mind at ease. He's lost none of the intensity demonstrated on his earlier work. This CD, which features some lovely melodic playing, merely showcases a different side of his tremendous artistry, and makes me even more eager to see what he's going to do in the future. I'm afraid some of the criticism equating him to the other Kenny G demonstates why many people will always apprehensive about sampling real jazz because of what they perceive as the snobbery of its aficionados. I love Coltrane, Shorter and Rollins as much as anyone, but I don't think it's fair to criticize Kenny's effort here because he doesn't match someone's ideal of the ""pure"" jazz saxophonist. Jazz should be a big tent. Let's invite people in, instead of scaring them away."
1,ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZzzzzzzz,"That's me snoring. If you are a fan of the smokin', boppin Kenny Garrett, skip this snoozer. Cut 10 (""3rd Quadrant"") is a real burner, but it's the only one on the CD. It's sad to see such talent wasted on such tepid material. I thought at least 2 cuts were by the other Kenny G. Go back and find a copy of ""African Exchange Student"" from 1990 to see what this guy is really capable of. Or ""Pursuance"". I'm giving this one to my Mom."
1,"Disappointing: radio-ready, slick, over-produced.","I normally love Kenny Garrett's stuff, but not this release. He's not challenging himself here. It's not adventurous. It sounds stilted and formulaic. I used to automatically buy any recording he did, but no longer. I will say that it kicks the s#&% out of the other Kenny G any day."
5,Kenny Garrett continues to enhance the jazz spectrum...,"The astounding polyrhythmic playing of drummer Chris Dave must be mentioned. He plays in various time signatures, with emotional accents, and a dazzling array of rhythmic innovations. Garrett's tonality is superb, as he floats above the fire that Chris Dave ignites......"
2,I guess I'm just spoiled.,"I want to like this album. I really do. I think the problem comes from the fact that I have become so spoiled. Over the past few years Kenny Garrett has produced some of the finest contemporary jazz around. Period. If you don't believe me just pick up a copy of ""Triology"", ""Persuance"", or the incredible ""Songbook"". Each album brought a sense of excitment and adventure to it. Now comes ""Simply Said"". This is, unhappily, a step backward for this wonderful artist. The tunes presented here seem tailored to the ""smooth jazz"" radio formula. Hey, I have no problem with an artist wanting to broaden his fan base, but I feel that this effort will only serve to turn off those who have been following his music for years. So, if you are looking for the same musical vision that you enjoyed so much on in the past: I suggest that you look elsewhere."
3,Not His Best,"After making a couple of really excellent albums (Pursuance and Songbook) that made him sound like a new John Coltrane, Kenny Garrett has made a recording that makes him sound like a new David Sanborn. At first, I was put off by the simplicity of the music on this disk (I guess that's what I get for not taking the CD's title seriously), but once I realized that Garrett seemed to be making a serious effort to put together a more commercial sound without completely selling out, I had to admire the effort that went into this disk. The songs are engaging but never banal, and unlike some pop saxophone releases, Simply Said sounds more interesting upon repeated listening. If you have a friend or relation that you would like to get interested in jazz but are afraid of either scaring them off or dumbing them down, this CD would make the perfect gift--accessible enough to please the ear, but sophisticated enough to engage the imagination."
2,A departure from the journey and the fire,"Ever since I first heard kenny, back In 1987 with OTB and following him with Miles listening to many tapes of Miles in concert and also seeing him live. He has always evoked deep emotion and passion and spirit from me, with his fury and risk taking playing! And his last recordings manage to grasp that side. But this venture is almost a complete turn around. It has a folksy feel with almost a radio format angle to it? Its not what I wish for when I want to hear Kenny play his wicked Alto. Yet its not a bad Cd, its just not what we expect as Kenny Garrett fans. He is a great musician and I hope he is not trying to grasp a new audiance. For I will always treasure the fury and passion that he reached!"
2,Such a disappointment,"What a shame. I went out and bought this without reading the reviews or listening to it or anything, just on the strength of his previous material. I wish I'd checked it out first. Aside from track ten, the album is extremely uninspiring for the most part, with several terrible tracks, including the title track. Stay away, and pray that his next release lives up to Songbook, Pursuance and all his earlier work."
2,Big Disappointment,"Kenny has emerged in the past few years as one of the strongest alto men out there. His playing has been fierce and he also also written and chosen great material. Neither of the these qualities are present on this CD, which veers very close to ""smooth jazz"". Sure, it is pleasant enough, but we have come to expect far more from Kenny. For his sake, I hope it sells well enough to finance ""Trilogy, Vol. 2"" or perhaps a live set."
2,Cute record.,"I don't use ""cute"" in a complementary sense. Kenny can blow his tail off, and has, particularly on ""Triology"" & ""Black Hope"", and certainly on live dates. Here, however, he barely plays. Very much a smooth-jazz album, all the musicians are underutilized. It sounds like there was someone in the studio censoring what everyone played. That said, some of the tunes are nice, and it's well produced. Drumming on the first two tunes is great. This could have been a much better record that it is."
4,Well written,"I must say that this book has everything in it. Murder, Conspiracy, Romance, Twists, and Turns; Bill Sloan took the Kennedy Assassination, and using his imagination wrote a brilliant fiction. The main character Matt is given such life-like qualities that you feel he is an old friend by the end of the novel. The story is completely fiction, but it makes you think, ""What if?"" If you like to read about The Kennedy Assassination, conspiracys, cover-ups revealed, or are just looking for a novel that has something new, I highly recommend this book."
4,"Great memories, great music!",All the songs I remembered were included in this cd and some I didn't remember. If you like simple folk/gospel songs made lively with great vocal harmony you'll love this cd.
3,There is a meeting here.,"Joe and Eddie only recorded for 3 years before tragedy struck in 1966. This is a good CD, more of a collectors item. The opening track ""There is a meeting"" is fantastic but I felt the album fell away a bit after the first track but still worth purchasing."
5,Well worth it!,"Without a doubt -- this IS the BEST of Joe & Eddie. Wonderful sound, wonderful memories. And my kids think I'm really ""cool"", too!"
5,Strong characters comes from great musical influences,"I was in high school (mid 1960's) when I first heard Joe & Eddie. All of my friends were riveted to their sound, even my parents liked them! ""There's a Meetin' Here Tonite"" - Whew! - we were all right there, standing tall next to the speakers when that song played. For the longest time, I thought the song ""Mariah"" was theirs, every other version has been a let down to me, even in ""Paint Your Wagon"".So much of the music of this era still holds up and this, now thankfully on a CD, is no exception."
5,They were role-models for my singing partner and me,"Back in the mid-sixties, my friend and I discovered the musical styling of Joe & Eddie. We immediately started doing verbatim copies of their wonderful arrangements in high school and area folk shows. I say verbatim - while we were pretty well received, nobody could blend and soar and excite like the originals.I was so happy to find out that this CD existed. It's been years and years (My Joe & Eddie albums disappeared long ago...probably right next to the Mickey Mantle rookie card I undoubtedly had. Thanks, Mom) and to hear them again has taken me back to a cherished time of my life. I hope my old buddy Carl is out there somewhere also singing along."
2,"If nothing else, it's geographically accurate","Sebastian Hope seems to be writing less about the sea gypsies and more about his opinions of the people he meets in his search for them. He is skeptical of the people he meets and devotes an entire page to writing about how a fellow writer also interested in sea gypsies is more interested in bragging about them. A lot of the book is spent talking about his views on the thoughts of the sea gypsies rather than on describing the actual thoughts or their lives. He comes across as a man who is desperately trying to avoid the label of an average tourist and incurring, instead the label of a man who talks too much about something he seems to know little about."
3,"Fantastic, but forgettable","When I first read AUTHORITY, I was blown away but just......how darn cool everything in it seemed. Its a masterpiece of style and force.Unfortunately, it goes so fast, and its so relentless, that it ultimately just remains kind of forgettable. It clobbers you over the head, and then just walks away. There's no buildup, no slowdown, just ACTION ACTION ACTION! VIOLENCE VIOLENCE VIOLENCE! Not to say that it isn't great at what it does, far from it. But once the Authority evens out and really gets meaty, it'll be one of the best things out there."
4,Jenny Sparks Rocks!!!,"With this being my 1st Wildstorm superheroes read it would appear I picked a winner. Went into this collection thinking it was going to be something similar to The Avengers or Justice League and I'm glad I was wrong. The superheroes here, even though they takes cues from early superhero types ( Such as Apollo has with Superman or The Midnighter with Batman) Warren Ellis has modernized them and brought them into the 21st century. I would gladdy recommend any one wanting to delve into Wildstorm's titles to go ahead and pick this one up."
4,I'm now hooked on this comic,"To be honest, I never heard of this title until I was playing around on Wikipedia and came across a short description. I decided to check it and out and after reading through the first graphic novel, I've ordered the next three.The ""superheroes"" in this series are very original and very interesting. I like the idea of a superheroe team who doesn't follow the ""rules"" of the comic book genre. These guys and girls aren't always nice and they don't apologize for it. They see their role in protecting the universe and they do whatever they feel is necessary to carry out their goals.The ""cast' of characters represent a wide range of lifestyles and racial backgrounds. The female characters are tough and gritty and pop off the page with persoanlity. The male characters range from two lovers, a smart mouthed ""god of the city"" and a shaman with a colorful view of the world.I would suggest this title if you want to see something different in your comics."
5,"Something different, but different is good","I had first read the two collected editions of Planetary which are also written by Warren Ellis. I decided to pick this up because I liked his work in the Planetary. I wasn't disappointed at all. The interaction between the characters is one of the things that I like the best, and their individual powers place them on god-like status. The development and character of Jenny Sparks is as good as any other I've read. The thing about this read is that you know that they have the power to defeat whatever crisis arises, the most interesting part is how everything comes together to solve the problems. Great read. Loved the art. Chi!"
1,God Awful,"This was quite possibly one of the worst TPBs I've ever read.It wasn't that it was too ""smart"" for me, as I am a fan of Grant Morrison, Alan Moore, etc. It wasn't that the heroes were more aggressive than the usual spandex bunch. It was the fact that there is zero character development, the dialogue is horrid, and every page is simply more of the same. It's late 90's shock value entertainment from the same era as Jerry Springer. Graphic violence, civilians killed for the ""greater good"", a take on Superman and Batman as a gay couple (which is so stereotypical and in your face that it's insulting to homosexuals), fights with God and the Earth itself, and more destroyes cities than you can shake a stick at.If you want a good superhero series that aren't cookie cutter crap, read Grant Morrison's JLA or Kurt Busiek's Astro City."
2,Boring!,"Even though I had read good things about this book, I'm not easily fooled by hype. Unfortunately, my low level of expectations were not met by this title.Standard Authority Plot:[Insert villains -- aliens, clones, time travelers, mutants, etc.] start a large scale invasion of [insert city or cities]. Authority attack with swift and violent force. It's still not enough to thwart force or it's not enough to defeat the source of the problem. Escape back to the Authority's huge space ship. Use the ship to decimate head villain by ramming the ship into villain's [Insert location -- fortress, dimension, secret base, etc.]. Repeat.I hope that I have saved you some money."
3,Kids stuff,"I read The Authority because i thought it was sort of a grown-up JLA but i was wrong.The story is very simple: bad guys attack earth cities just for the thrill, superheroes fight back resulting in a body count that would make any actual war look like a kids fight.But what i didnt really like was the characterization. Most of the characters dont have a defined personality, others have powers that simply doesnt make sense (God of the Cities?), everybody have dialogs of a 80s action b-movie and then theres Jenny Sparks,the team leader. Like other Mr. Ellis lead characters shes a tough-talking, chain-smoking, annoying person who is a century old but seems to have the maturity of Paris Hilton.Yeah..there is a gay relationship between 2 male characters but who wouldnt be gay with women like Jenny Sparks all around.I gave it 3 stars for the art that is really awesome."
1,Shallower than Hollywood,"This wildly popular book suffers from thin plots and thinner characters. Ellis won praise for his frank portrayal of a gay superhero couple in this series, and rightly so. Ten points for social sensitivity, and about minus a million points for shallow, one-dimensional characters (yes, even Apollo and the Midnighter), literally mindless violence, repetetive plots, and aggressively insensitive portrayal of practically everything else. Particularly offensive was the grinning Fu Manchu villain and his yellow horde.It is interesting that Ellis was happy to turn this book over to another writer. Perhaps he chose to concentrate on Planetary, a companion series to the Authority that was it's polar opposite. Planetary had great character development and clever plots that both satired and honored the many genres that inform current superhero comics."
1,Not the Notre Dame Band,"This is not by the Notre Dame Band and It is only their VERSION of the fight song, not the original. It sounds digital and has many changes to the music."
2,"Informative and thorough, but hopelessly outdated","Before you do anything else, look at the publish date of this book. In Internet time, this book is an antique. While very informative regarding the state of technology in early 1997, its relevance is minimal today. As an unintended history of Internet commerce technology, it is interesting, but as an in-depth guide to design and structure of today's solutions it lacks currency.Some examples:No reference to DVD-Rom in the discussion of CD-Rom (DVD not commercially available when published); Amazon.com as an afterthought in the discussion of e-commerce players (early in growth cycle); ISDN as the holy grail of internet connectivity (cable and DSL not commercially available)...and so on. Do yourself a favor and find a book no more than 3-6 months old."
3,You pay for the name only....,"This pan is indeed constructed extremely well, and it cooks evenly. However, after the first use, the interior will be forever stained. This was my first surprise, that the mirror finish on the bottom of the inside is not permanent. After a few uses, my conclusion is that the Kitchen Aid products are way overpriced, and that you can purchase exactly the same performance from your local Target or K-mart store in the Caphalon, Anolon, or even Revere-Ware lines, for 1/4 of the money. I would recommend this pan only if you are going to use it every day for the rest of your life and feed at least 10 people a day."
1,Ongoing disappointment,"I was hoping and a wishing to hear more of the lili thatI heard on the pbs josh grobin special,in you recordings, I was captivated by your stage presence and talent, unfortunatelythis did not happen for me. I hope that in time you'll give ussome more of this lili, this lady of fire and passion.thank you, starrtriman@aol.com"
3,"Not As ""80's Style"" As It Thinks It Is","Porkchop is a new slasher movie that pays homage to slasher classics like Texas Chainsaw Massacre and Friday the 13th. Unfortunately, despite some cool moments here and there and a few laughs, it is lacking. The killer in this one wears a pig mask, and he is an awesome killer. The trouble is that he really doesn't get that much screen time. There is some decent gore, but some of the deaths aren't that great. And I was expecting more humor than I got, being that this is supposed to be a satire. Don't expect the brilliant silliness of Caesar And Otto's Summer Camp Massacre. The movie does have some T & A, and even some brief male nudity for the ladies and gay men. Porkchop is okay, but it could have been so much more."
2,Porkchop,"I have had this movie for a month or two but just got around to watching it (I have a DVR box and always have something to watch). I took the time to get to my many DVDs waiting for me. I picked this one first, unfortunately. This starts out normal. Kids camping in the woods. The pig mask the killer wears does look authentic which bothered me. There is a scene at the beginning credits which disturbed me greatly (an actual pig being beaten in the head), not for me, I fastforwarded. There is a kill scene that is most unnerving with the cheerleader in the tree and what was it with the fetus?? It looked like a Buddha baby and had green blood when it was stomped on. Ick!!!!!! The girl did not even look pregnant and wore her cheerleading outfit from the beginning of the movie to the very end. As if being a cheerleader is not bad enough they have to throw it in our face. The kill scenes were not as bloody as I expected but the robot is a hoot. I leave it up to you but I am donating it to Goodwill."
1,Total Waste,This is the worst movie I have ever seen. Not even the nudity could save this film. Your time and money would be better spent doing anything else. Dont recommend this film for anyone
1,Did not last as expected !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I have had this pan for 2-3 years. This is my most used pan, we use it almost every day. We have been very strict to use appropriate nonstick pan utensils. The pan just flat has worn out !! The nonstick surface never pealed like cheap pans, but the center area of the pan that gets the direct heat in the last month became increasing ""sticky"" and very difficult to clean. There are no scrathes, but the color has changed. Food also started burning at low temperatures. And heat is no longer distributing. I have a large set of anolon with a lot of add on's -- so I will stick with them for now -- but I will not buy anymore until i see if this happens again. Very disappointed !!!!!!!!!!"
5,Brother loved this cd!,"My brother lives in Las Vegas. I wanted to send him something from our home state of North Carolina. Since John Boy and Billy are on the radio here, I ordered this cd for him for Christmas. A few weeks later, he listened to it on the way to work one day. He called me later to tell me how hilarious this was and to find out if there were more available."
3,laura Ingalls Wilder growing up in the little house,"Laura Ingalls wilderI did my biography on laura Ingals wilder.Iloved learning about what it was like liveing back then.she was born feb.7,1865 in the big woods of wisconson. She had one sister at hat time.Marey Ingalls.laura moved to kansas wehen she was three.And her baby sister caroline Ingalls was born.one year later the movedto minasotta in a small town called walnutt grove.She spent the rest of her life there.Whan she was 18 she became a teacher at a local school and met a man named Almonzo Wilder.They had a childrose wilder.Laura died at the age of 90 three days after her birthday."
5,Orginal yet Classic,"This album seems to center on Robert Bradley's memories about the past, and how beauty is in a woman. In Bellybone, he sings about his woman, and how much he loves everything about her. In California he sings about how he remembers visiting California when he could see. This album has music that will touch your soul to the very core."
4,British Rockabilly,"Amazon (as of 1/11/10) has the wrong biography up for this group, which is a British Rockabilly outfit. Four tracks on this 2 CD set feature Gene Vincent. Following is quoted from an online review.""The Wild Angels started as a garage rock-a-billy band in the UK in 1967 and was selected to be Gene Vincent's backing group on his British Tour the next year. They released a few studio and live albums in the '70s and are still playing Rock 'n Roll Reunion gigs and Teddy Boy festivals in the new millenium.Live, Wild, Red Hot 'N' Rockin is a 2-CD collection of albums tracks, demos and outtakes. Track 12 is a raw, rocking version of The Band's ""Time to Kill"" from Stage Fright. The Wild Angels also cover two early Ronnie Hawkins and the Hawks tracks, ""Odessa"" and ""Forty Days""."""
1,"Wow, this book was bad","I have to agree with the last guy who reviewed this book. I figured from all the stories I have heard about ""Fireball"" that this book would knock my socks off. Instead it went all over the place and then again it went nowhere. Hardly any racing stories at all and not much about the crash that took his life. Some of the pictures were neat to see but just about every picture in the book is used more then once. You would think there is tons of photos out there of him, so the need to keep using the same photos at different parts of the book seemed odd. And way to many pics of his girlfriend. I sometimes felt like the book was about her, more then him. If you can pick this up cheap somewhere for a few dollars it may be worth it. Other then that, it was a huge letdown. I read it fairly quick and when I was done it was like I learned nothing at all about the man."
5,Fireball the man and how it affected his racing.,"Fireball Roberts was a professional race-car driver, it said so right on his driver's license. This book is more about his personal life than many folks would like, they would like to ignore the facts of his marital split, his girl-friend, and his escapades. Well, they are just part of what made Fireball who he was--a man who raced cars. The major problem I have with this book is the photographs without captions. They leave me wondering ""Who were these people,"" ""Where was this race?,"" ""Which year was this?"" etc. Obviously written with input from Judy Judge, his girl-friend and fiance, but not Fireball's first wife and his late daughter, it is a little one-sided. I hope that another book comes out that Pam, his daughter, was working on. It would show another side of him, I'm sure."
5,Top Stock Car Driver,Glad I found this book as he has always been my all time favorite watching excerpts of the old time racing on b/w tv in grammer school. Followers of the original champions will enjoy this book and the personal stories in it.
1,Poorly written!! Don't but this,This book is the worst NASCAR book I have ever read. The writer jumps all around Fireball's life but never delves into anything deep. There is no continunity in the time line of the book. I would not recommend this book to anyone.
5,Pyle Marine Speakers,I was very satisfied with these speakers they sound awesome and look good for the price. I would recomend these to any one looking for low cost great sounding speakers. At Amazon .com
4,Great speakers,Speakers work great. Limited on their range but overall for the price they get the job done.
2,only lasted 1 year,Almost a year to the day I installed the Pyle PLMR62 one of the speakers has blown. Up until then they sounded great. well worth the price if they last more then A year.
4,Good Little Speaker,Excellent value. Just don't put too much low end on them. I would suggest bass blockers or using an electronic crossover with a separate amp. 80 Hz is the magic number. Very efficient.
1,Poor Quality PLMR62 Speakers,"I purchased a pair of these speakers 7 months ago for my center console boat. They are located on the rear of the console and the console is covered when not in use. This should keep them in a relatively dry environment.After two months the first speaker failed. I found that the solder joint on the speaker connecter had a cold/loose solder. Rather than send the unit back and pay the $20 return shipping and the price to ship it, I re-soldered it.Both speakers worked fine for a few more months then both speakers went out. I checked them out again and found both speakers had their connectors severely corroded. After cleaning them one speaker worked fine, but the other goes in and out.Net is that in 7 months both speakers failed due to poor workmanship and materials. The cost to have them repaired/replaced twice under warranty is more then they are worth. I will never buy another Pyle product."
4,need for fun,"The Need for Speed series sure has improved since its Playstation One days. This is seriously a very good game. I agree that a longer career mode and a softer challenge would have improved the game, but you really can't complain about any of that when the game offers so much more.It's not just another racing game. I mean, I guess that's not true. But at least game makers are keeping them fun. This is a very fun game."
4,Good,"In this game there you can choose what car class you want to be. I prefer the mussle class because I need my Dodge Charger(The New One). The gameplay was like Most Wanted and Underground 2. The pursuit in this game was good but not as good as the Most Wanted ones. The graphics are about the same as Most Wanted. In this game there is a new gameplay, the cannon racing. I have not got this down but I will get it sometime. Overall it is a good game but I love NFS so I am going to get all of them."
5,Four and a half.,"This is a great need for speed game. I have played most of the recent ones so i bought this one. Im glad i did because this game has great graphics and the sound is awsome. The customazation on this game is awsome and it is amazing of how much u can customize the cars. There r so many cars to buy too and they look so real even when u fix them up. The music depends on what type of car that u have. If u have a muscle car u have rock music, tuners have techno type of music, and exotic cars have hip-hop which is my favorite. There is challenges to do too to unlock cars that u cant in the carrer mode. The quick race is handy for multiplayer. U can have a crew too so u can do better in races. The only thing i do not like about this game is that the cops r annoying when u get arrested and have to pay a fine. If u get arrested all three times u get ur car taken away. This is a great game with great graphics so i would buy it."
4,The best Need for Speed title yet!,"I love this game. You should buy the collector's edition instead, because there are more cars available in it. It is a lot of fun, especially in the canyon races. This game is challenging at the end, but the story flows nicely. The only complaint I have is about the cars. I love drifting and tuners. Since they combined those two elements, they should have at least included a 240sx, whether it would be a S13, S14, S15. Overall this game is very well worth $40.00."
1,Bad service,"the seller shipped my video game dirty and scratched. Is awful this service, is very irresponsible and is bad quality."
2,need for slowness,it was an ok game but the cars go way to slow and the cops are to fast and the crashes all look the same a door falls off or the hood and it has bad graphics.
1,scratched and didn't work,i got the game scratched and it didn't work at all. i was mad and will never buy another game online again. Thanks a lot.
3,Move On,"My editor, who grew up in Texas and saw both Hank Williams and the young Elvis (pre-Army) live, assures me that Hank Snow is OK, but ""he couldn't carry Hank Williams shoes.""I couldn't agree more. ""I'm Movin' On"" is an absolute classic, a tune that should be covered by more country AND rock bands. There's a lot of other good stuff here, too. I think Snow's version of ""A Fool Such As I"" is great, for instance.But, if ""Rhumba Boogie"" and ""The Gal Who Invented Kissin'"" (""I don't recall her name but I do believe that gal should sit up high in the hall of fame"") are considered ""essential recordings,"" you're talking about a second-tier talent at best."
5,Absolutely! One of THE BEST,I am 49 years old and was raised on this fine gentlemans' music. I love and buy all types of music. But ya know what? I listen to this CD at least once a week. Why? Because it makes me feel good!
5,His Music Stands the test of Time,"I don't think I've heard a dud from Hank Snow. If you like older traditional country music, you can't go wrong with this singer.And I always liked his style of playing guitar."
2,"Ok for British sex ed vid on AIDS, other than that....","I found this video to be a real snoozer. While the title ""My first time"" suggests a sexy look at guy's first experiences, nothing could be farther from the truth. This video is best suited as a high school sex-ed video dealing with to how to protect you from sexually transmitted diseases. While it is true that the information presented is accurate and valid, if I knew that sex ed is what this video preached about (i.e. how to use a condom), I would have passed. This video is produced in England, and for an American, the accents can be distracting. My recommendation is if you are a virgin and know nothing about gay sex, get this video. If you know the ropes, pass on this one."
1,A safe sex documentary,"This film is disappointing. The narration is distracting and tedious. What there is of the individual stories is interesting, but not worth suffering through endless sex education for the hopelessly ignorant."
3,False advertising,"THis item is advertised as a sort of ""soft porn"" video, but is really a British educational film, and poorly done at that! Not the seller's fault, unless they watched it."
2,Ironing Nightmare,"Everything about this shirt is great except for one thing, the wrinkles. I've never owned a shirt that was this hard to iron the wrinkles out. When I wear it to work it gets so full of wrinkles that by noon it looks like I've slept in the shirt.The sizing is excellent, the shirt is well made and will last a long time. I'd give the shirt five stars is it were not for the wrinkles."
5,Great author,Great series-read them all. You will miss them when you are done. Anxiously waiting for new series.
4,owllady,This is the next book to the primrose creek series and just as good as the first one. Very good book.
3,christy,To me this book was just o.k. Not as good as some ofLinda Lael Millers books. I dont really recommend it.
4,cute - looks like punxsutawney phil,"very cute - a good beanie baby. His hat is sewn on well, as is his very adorable bowtie. He is just as fuzzy as he looks in the picture. great for groundhogs day parties!!"
4,comfortable,"very comfortable, holds my stomach in, but i don't think they slimmed me that much. however, they are very comfortable and that is important. Rita, Orlando, Fl."
5,Simple majesty,"This cd is so good that you could make the case that most of the tracks don't vary much from one another and that that's a great thing. Deceptively simple song structures that just seem to add up to a superb record. Intelligent lyrics, and very melodic; just the kind of music you don't hear on the radio anymore. You can't go wrong with this purchase; very highly recommended."
5,Top notch selection.,"I'm a 4 time repeat customer. Spyderco quality is absolutely beyond question. This knife was purchased as a gift for my grandson who has always admired my other purchases. He's had other knives but always coveted mine. I could have given him one of them but wouldn't part with them. I sent one back for repair of the pocket clip I'd damaged and they sent me a brand new knife in return, at no charge! You can't go wrong with a company like that."
5,Great knife,Spyderco is known for their high quality knives and 10 years after buying my first one it is nice to see that the quality is every bit as good today as it was a decade ago. I highly recommend Spyderco knives.
5,Great EDK,"I carry this with me whenever I go out and use it often in my house. This is a great every day knife, I often use it to open everything! The blade is sharp enough, but it is not going to cut you if you lightly touch it. It is also unimposing and safe look and feel to it. I can't recommend this knife enough to anyone who just wants a blade to carry around for household chores!"
5,Perfect knife!,"I don't like serrated blades so I got the one with plane blade. The best description word I can give is ""perfect"". Everyone loves this knife and envies me when they see it. It stays very comfortable in my hand and feels just like it was specially designed for me. I definitely recommend it as an everyday companion knife and as a great easy to use tool."
4,Good Knife,"A good solid knife. Well balanced. The only thing I don't like is for someone that uses a knife a lot it's not the easiest to open and close. And impossible to close one-handed. I will be puchesing another knife that is easier to open and close, but I will be very happy to carry this one with me. I highly recomend this knife for anyone looking for an everyday knife for light use."
1,Lousy!,"Circulon is great in the beginning, but it does NOT last. I bought this set (or one very similar to it) ten years ago, have not used most of it very much, and have taken proper care of it (only plastic or wooden implements used and never put in the dishwasher). Virtually everything that I have used regularly needs to be replaced. The hard anodized surface wears off, and food begins sticking to it. The grooves are very difficult to clean, because food gets stuck in between them. I am in the process of replacing all of it with Caphalon Commercial Non-Stick, whose incredibly smooth surface cooks like a dream. It costs a little bit more, but maybe ten years from now, it won't have to be replaced."
2,"At First Great, Later Not So Great!","I have a complete set of Circulon Cookware and have used it for several years. At first it worked well, but after awhile I had increasing difficulty with food sticking and problems cleaning. The pots tend to work fine because you cook with significantly more liquid. The pans are the true shortcoming. After cooking with the pans I fill them with hot water and sometimes some dish detergent and let them soak. I find washing them after at least a 15 minute soak to still be problematic. I have to rub vigorously with a sponge, even then you cannot properly clean-out the grooves.I am phasing out my set and moving back to cast iron, aluminum and aluminum clad stainless. I do better cooking the old fashioned way."
3,"Good Saucepans, but not skillets","Although I am happy with the performance of my saucepans and stockpot, at least five years after purchasing my set, I was very disappointed in the skillets and sautes. I take meticulous care of my cookware and follow usage directions, but the non-stick coating didn't hold up on the skillets. I had to replace those items a long time ago."
1,JUNK,"I have had a set of these for about 5 years and I hate them. They are hard to keep clean, food love those cracks. They are not any better [than a less exspensive brand]. Don't get sucked in to these, they are over priced junk. I just whish I did not pay so much for them. I cannot wait to replace these."
1,Beware!! This cookware is NOT non-stick!!,"This product -- the Circulon 10-piece nonstick cookware set -- is NOT non-stick. Each of the pots and pans has a grooved ""non-stick"" surface. But food sticks in the grooves. I just cooked a scrambled egg in my brand new skillet, and cleaning egg out of the grooves required real effort -- serious scrubbing with a non-abrasive plastic pad. Any inexpensive cookware with a smooth non-stick surface would have been much easier to clean. If ease of cleaning is important to you, this not the set to buy."
2,VERY difficult to keep clean,"I've had this cookware for 5 years and am very disappointed with it. The ridges, while they may be great for cooking, make it almost impossible to keep clean. I find this especially with the fry pans, since that's what gets the most things stuck in the grooves (eggs, meat, etc.) Circulon has produced a scrubber to address this problem, but that really isn't much help. I'm on this site looking for a replacement set."
1,Disappointed,"My husband and I bought a set of these (or a similar set) about 8 years ago. We thought we liked them at the beginning, but we gradually found that food would stick to the nonstick surface, especially in the grooves. The grooves are VERY hard to clean. I rarely use Circulon anymore (probably once every other year or less). Most of the pieces have not been used because of the above reasons. We even donated some (still in mint/unused condition) to charity because they're not worth using. The cheapo Wal-Mart nonstick pots and pans are better value than these. Don't waste your money on any Circulon cookware!"
1,Very Disappointed,"I had always liked the look of the pots and pans and got a set as a wedding gift 4 years ago. At first they were great but over time, the non-stick surface wears away and the food gets stuck in the grooves as other people have mentioned. We never use metal utensils. I am extremely disappointed in these pots and would not recommend them to anyone. In fact I hate them and so does my wife. I would advise anyone considering them to keep looking. Most of the negative reviews come from people who have had these pots and pans for years. Trust us, these pots and pans [stink]."
4,Circulon Brand Cookware,"Been using our new set about a month & think it's great. We've had no problem with food sticking in the grooves. The cookware does heat up slowly, and then cooks with minimum heat. Only complaint is we can't toss it in the dishwasher, but clean-up is easy."
1,Still waiting to hear it,"Would love to listen to it, but my JVC 723GD player won't read it.The player tries reading it and then ejects the disc.Best Buy won't take the disc back so i can't tell if it is the disc or the player."
1,Bela Fleck Bluegrass Sessions II DVD,"If you own the cd don't bother getting this DVD like I did. It is the same CD with the exception of a clickable interface. I was wondering why there was no information available for it, now I know why, it was a complete waste of my money... (for the record, I'm a huge Bela fan...)"
2,jazzy but I guess that's Bela,"I wasn't sure what to expect from the audio cd but one listen through it and found out Bela's style (to me)is almost pure jazz. and this genre of music is not a preference of mine. He is, of course, remarkably proficient. was all i could do to force myself to listen to the entire cd. sorry, Bela fans."
3,Not great bluegrass,"There's no doubt about Bela's virtuosity, but I was disappointed by this album. The musicians all do a great job, but the arrangements are so technically perfect I found myself bored. The music lacks the fire, raw energy or sense of spontaneous fun that makes bluegrass great."
5,Excellent CD,I truly enjoy this collection of Bluegrass music by Bela Fleck and friends. I would recommend this to anyone who is looking for something interesting and fun to listen too.
5,Truely the BEST banjo player ever!,5 stars is ALL I can give Bela? Maybe 10+ stars is more like it. Bela once again spoiled me with his sick banjo playing. I also can't forget all the other equally sick musicans on this CD. Highly recommended!
3,"Great Content, Poor Video Quality","This is a standard-definition version of material originally shot in high definition. When seen in high-def, the vistas and scenery are breathtaking, so this standard-def version is very disappointing.Time for the releasing company to insist on a new, high-def transfer from the original material."
3,An excellent aerial special interest film,"Over California, as well as the entire ""over"" various other States series of aerial documentaries are breath-takingly excusite. However, once you have seen any of these series in the orignal High Definition format, even a pristine DVD rendition is a bit of a let-down. In any event, it is still a worthwhile purchase. I can't wait for the arival of the entire series on the High Definition format (as soon as a format finally arrives). Having a HD-Recorder and capturing any of these series of aerial films via HD satellite or HD-cable is the ultimate way to go for now."
2,Over California,"There is a problem with the DVD, it freezes up right in the middle of the documentary."
2,Not for ceramic cooktops,"Overall this is a great pan if you are cooking with gas. The pan bottom will warp in a few months. It no longer heats fast nor evenly on my ceramic cooktop. The cover is not glass and sinks in, so the food is not visible and the depth is limited. Almost indestructible and very heavy."
1,Complete idiocy for the deluded.,"I feel like a mosquito in a nudist colony...I'm not sure where to start. This book is full of idiocy. Yeah, that sums it up."
4,Interesting theory,"While too jargon-ridden to be considered light reading, it nevertheless presents an interesting theory, one which was considered the standard for many years, before our current bunch of ""there's-never-been-anyone-as-smart-as-we-are"" academics started attacking it. The author discusses some of the tens of thousands of examples he has found, in multiple languages, and how modern liguists are beginning to believe that, at one time, there was a single, common language on earth - as long as it wasn't similar to Hebrew! He also gives examples of Hebrew etymologies being stripped from dictionaries; for example, the word ""amen"" still shows a Hebrew past, but the similar word ""amenable,"" with a similar meaning (though a different part of speech) does not."
3,No Difference,"This product doesn't smell any different from the original Tap A Drop. Thought it would be nicer, and a little less industrial"
2,Big problem with this dvd...,"Big problem with this video:You cannot pause, fast-forward, or rewind it.If you miss anything the instructor says, you have to go all the way back to the beginning of that lesson and wait for that part to come around again.I don't have this problem with any other dvd in my collection.This is extremely frustrating, and pretty much renders this dvd useless."
3,Fishes arnt happy,You get what you pay for. electrical wiring was bad. My son rewired the entir component just 2 months after purchase.
3,"Like some, like some not","I was alive & well in the 80's when this group was in its hayday, and i must say i don't remember them. Then again, there are plenty of songs/artists i've forgotten over the years after not hearing them enough (hear that, ClearChannel?), and plenty i'd LIKE to forget but can't for hearing them TOO much (hear that, ClearChannel?) so i understand that they may have been known (even by me) back then & i just forgot them. That being said, i was ""reintroduced,"" as it were, to them by internet radio station Pandora.com. Thus i purchased this CD based on the sound of the track ""Winners & Losers,"" definitely my favorite. But there are a few others, though VERY few. ""Here & Now"" is a lovely track & ""Get In Touch With Me"" is a nice gem as well. But overall, the rest of their ""hits"" sound a little generic & forced. It's a wonder they weren't played anyway (...ClearChannel?)"
5,Superb!,"This is absolutely indispensable for a serious study of Pound's Cantos, the glosses are totally thorough, and the companion maintains the brevity appropriate to its task. This book does not contain much in the way of criticism, and that is not what it is attempting to accomplish. This book makes Pound's allusions accessible, and allows the Cantos to be actually read on their own terms; the text includes information on every single thing which might be unintelligible for the very average reader, with indexes, supplements on Chinese characters, etc. If you intend to read or study the Cantos, in an at all meaningful way, you should use this text--unless of course you know greek, latin, chinese, italian, medieval history, World War II, Dante, economics, not to mention the whole English literary canon."
3,Not so good at oily stain removal,"I was drawn to purchase this ALL Stain Lifter because I trusted it would do just that: lift common stains from clothing. But after working my way thru almost an entire box, I noticed I was having to pretreat simple stains more & more. And it's just myself and my husband: we get very few heavy-duty stains but even the slightest oily stain will leave a dark spot on a garment. I am very dissapointed and will go back to using Gain."
3,LP masters,"The original LP used 45 mono masters. I do not mind the stereo masters being used, but on selections such as ""Doncha Think It's Time"" (45 and LP version is a different master using different spliced takes) ""Lover Doll"" (45 EP master did not have the Jordanaires) ""Dixieland Rock"" (45 EP master had the first beats of the intro missing) and You'll Think of Me"" (the backing vocals were mixed differently on the single master) the 45 single version should have been used. For the companion to this collection see:50 Worldwide Gold Hits: Volume 1, Parts 1 & 2"
4,Solid Foundations,'Real magic' provides a solid foundation on the reality of magic and the hidden powers of the mind. The revisions to the classic work bring it up to date. This is an essential read for anyone interested in magic and its role in the development of Pan Indo-European neolithic and neopagan cultures.
2,Does a disservice to the pagan community,"Bonewits's treatise on magick is good enough as an introduction to magickal practice, but falls flat on its face on the whys of magick. Most of his explanation of the ""science behind magick"" is pseudoscience, much of it already thoroughly debunked, especially now that the Russian science community is no longer under Soviet control. His explanations of auras and telepathy are particularly disappointing; if it is true that they involve radio waves, they should have been measured under controlled conditions, and they haven't been. His 'color categories' of magick only cloud discussion. Read this book with a great deal of skepticism. Then move on to Liber Null or Magick in Theory and Practise."
1,Self-important nonsense,Bonewits does little more than arrogantly prattle on about how he's right and everybody else is wrong. He combines the worst parts of Aleister Crowley with the worst parts of Pat Robertson. There are a lot of far better books on the subject of magic. TryInner Traditions of MagicorInitiation into Hermeticsinstead.
1,A waste Of Time,This man is so full of himself. He comes across as the cult of personality for the neopagan movement telling people who to ostracize and who to embrace. His hypocrisy is on the scale of Jim Baker. Read some of the drivel on his website if you don't believe me.
5,xena,Xena doll recieved in condition promise and within time period give. Very happy with my experience
5,One of the greatest I have met,"I actually got to meet Ty England. It was my Jr. year of high school at the National FFA Convention in Kansas. He was the FFA Alumni Spokesman. I heard him play there and got a picture taken and an autograph. He was very nice, charming and very, very handsome. His music showed his personality well. This album has many great songs that I love to hear over and over again!"
5,Great Manga; Great Anime,"Fullmetal Alchemist, Vol. 2Fullmetal Alchemist is one of the, if not the best, animes out to date, and the story originated from these manga strips and books. Originally appearing in the Shonen Gangan by Square Enix, Fullmetal Alchemist is an immerse story about two brothers and their struggles to get their mother back to life, and also correct their defunk bodies from a failed attempt to bring their mother back to life through the taboo of 'human transmutation'. Science fans and fiction fans alike will fall in love with this manga.I recommend reading the books and watching the manga side by side to get the most out of the story."
3,A Little Too Dark for Me,"I agree that some of the music on this soundtrack is interesting but I think I'd need to be on qualudes to really get into it. I remember listening to Princeton University's radio station, WPRB, when I lived in the area in 1984 and the music played was quite similar to the music here. I like the Rupert Hine element here, but not the Marilyn Manson element, also here. ""From Her to Eternity"" is much more entertaining in the movie, with all of the wacked-out Germans bobbing their heads to the moribund, captivating beat that eschews chord changes. Other points of interest:Marion's monologue plays very nicely off the cellos, as spoken German can be very mesmerizing, especially when you don't understand a work of it. Then there is a piece with baritone sax that mirrors the odd heaviness of the cellos.But, again, I'd need some qualudes to really get into it. I think I'll pass."
3,Inconsistent,"Some of the music on this album is truly astonishing, and some of it is sort of nebulous. This album I'd recommend strongly as a jumping-off-point: there's a lot of artists on it that one might find enjoyment in if one likes Nick Cave's work (Bad Seeds or Birthday Party).But gawd, listening to Bruno Ganz nattering on ""wien das kinde kinde wahr..."" gets a bit old."
4,The Essential Gary Stewart,"Gary Stewart's vocals remind one of Jerry Lee Lewis,but his music is pure country.If you like drinking songs and traditional country music I think you will enjoy this c.d."
5,"The best in country -- no, he was just THE BEST","Gary Stewart is more country than any of the current generation of country singers, and he far transcends them -- as well as the artists of any other genre. I cannot think of another artist who can pull at your heartstrings as he brings back those memories of a painful end to a relationship, of the loss of a true love, and the desolate aftermath of that loss. Anyone who has ever been in love, and then lost that love, can relate to his songs. Gary committed suicide after the loss of his wife -- can anyone name another artist who has embodied the words he sang so emphatically? Can anyone think of another great singer who found that he could not express his loss with his words, and literally had to end it all? I miss that girl who broke my heart, but I miss Gary even more, because he understood."
4,B-movie novel is better than movie it's from.,"David Seltzer once again wrote a novel based on his script for a major studio horror feature. As with his work on The Omen, Prophecy actually reads like a novel and not just a script in narrative form. It is also quite superior to the film version, but then so is most other monster tales. Ferocious mutants terrorize Indians, lumberjacks, and EPA investigators in the woods of Maine. Recommended reading for all monster buffs."
2,Predictable horror potboiler,"Complete with evil corporate types as the generators of The Monster. Not much effort to flesh out either characters or situation. Indians are stereotype Indians, pregnant women are automatically nurturing, corporate officials are in denial. Same old same old."
3,Usable but not as soft as what the hospital had for the baby,"I was looking for an item similar to the disposable dry wipes the hospital had for use when I delivered my son. In the hospital, they were soft but firm, and you had to wet them yourself with water. I ordered this item in hopes it would be similar, but these are too rough, not as soft. I did end up using them as a protective layer for the diaper changing pad though, and they worked just fine for that purpose."
3,Rough surface but good service,"The service from this company is great--arrived the next day. The wipes were purchased for cleaning my baby's diaper area, and they are little rough for this purpose however. I will be looking for a softer alternative once these are used up"
1,Not good enough,"A paltry bit of information for $5.95. The birthdate appears to be incorrect, as well. This ""article"" puts it an April 20, 1964, but I have seen numerous other citations that say May 13, 1964. So which is it, and why the discrepancy?"
1,Spend the Money on the Baha Man sound track,Purchased single for my daughter (5 years old). Not into this type of music and didn't want to get the full lenght Baha Men cd because I didn't want to have to listen to the other tracks on that album. The single was not by Baha Men and sounds nothing like their release...in fact it was a disapointment. Spend the extra few bucks and get the Baha Men CD. I ended up buying it anyway. I will have to throw the single in with my truck when I sell it or use it for a paper wieght !
1,NOT WHAT I NEEDED,"THIS BOOK TURNED OUT TO BE A RELIGIOUS/CHRISTIAN OUTLOOK ON COUNSELING, ONE THAT I WILL NOT USE. NOT BECAUSE I DON'T BELIEVE IN GOD, BECAUSE I DO, BUT I NEED MORE CLINICAL APPLICATIONS THAT CAN BE USED TO HELP THOSE AFFECTED BY SEXUAL ABUSE. I CANNOT USE THE BOOK AT ALL, AND IT HAD ABSOLUTELY NO COVER ON IT. BAD MOVE FOR ME!!!!!!!!!!"
5,Beyond Survival,I am amazed and delighted by her incorporation of Christian theology in the practice of psychology. Her quote of therapy being both incarnational and redemptive puts Holy Light into the work of counseling. Amen!
3,"I agree, not worth $$","Given the price of this little collection, it should have been more durable. The ark falls apart, heads and limbs have fallen off with mild play. And the animals are just your typical dollar store plastic animals. If it had been half the price (under $10), the rating would be higher, but still not 5 stars."
2,Blisters,These are the only running shoes that have continuously given me blisters. Even with good running socks after a couple 10K runs these shoes gave me a blister on my heel. I tried different lacing but it didn't matter. Threw them away. I thought I would buy some cheaper trainers for when I have to run inside on a treadmill. It can get down to around -40 for weeks here and I usually run outside. If you run less than 10K or just walk/slow jog it might not matter.
2,Don't buy unless looks dont matter,"So I just got my shoes after waiting two long weeks....what a dissapointment. I open the box and immediately I see what appears to be a defect. The inside of the shoe (like on your right foot, the left side, not the right) was covered in little black dots that were smudged all over the grey area, including smudging on the asics logo. This was obviously a manufacturing defect seein it was the same color as the logo which was also smudged. Also, the shoe glue was leaking out the back of the shoe. Poorly done, last time I will ever buy ASICS shoes again."
4,Great TV,"I decided to purchase this TV after seeing it on display at a local electronics store. The picture has great color and clarity from various angles, and the sound is decent as well. There doesn't seem to be much glare from other light sources. I would recommend making sure the top area is well ventilated since it does put off a decent amount of heat after long viewing.Overall, I'm happy with my purchase."
4,very pleased,"Can't believe I got this much tv for the price I paid. Very satisfied. Picture is fantastic..size was perfect for my space. A little disapointed with the sound quality but I added speakers and that was good enough. Amazon cust service reps were so helpful, made me feel very comfortable with my purchase...delivery was supper smooth. I recomended this unit to 2 friends. Supper Bowl sunday was a good day in New York...thanks Amazon."
3,compatability with cable company???,"Love it , Love it. Only problem is that I added a seran sound to the product, now I am stuck with 3 remote control ( cable, seran sound, and samsung) Upon calling Samsung inorder to set up the remote to operate the cable box (scientific atlantic/cable vision) I was informed that they are not compatable with the set up (eventhough the setup code for my cable company are in the owners manual). So now to change volume, source, on/off- I am stuck with 3 remotes and it is total confusion just trying to figure out which is sound,on/off buttons ,etc, etc. Samsung told me that buying a universal controller might solved some of the problems. This is pending. Otherwise the TV is just lovely (picture, sound, colors). It tends to get dusty quickly because of the finish."
5,Great Tv,"Got this tv in late Sept and have had no problems so far,picture is great on hd and sd and with my Toshiba hd player its like being at a concert live.Buy it and buy it at Amazon."
4,Great TV for the value,"I bought this item here on Amazon for a few hundred cheaper than at the best electronics store and I have to say that it is a great buy for the buck. This TV is not the best LCD out there, since it is not 1080P with the highest contrast ratio, but for someone who does not care to have the best resolution, you woudn't even notice that it is not 1080P. It has sharp contrast, great picture (as long as the program/DVD is in HD), and even 480i broadcasts/movies look quite good. If you're not looking for the state of the art item, but rather a good quality TV at a good value, I would highly recommend this TV.UPDATE: 1/20/11 I want to add that it's been almost 4 years since I purchased this TV and it has outlasted two others that I purchased after wards (1080P and different brands). I use this TV for at least 8-10 hours a day as my main computer/gaming monitor and it has not given me any issues. No regrets with this purchase."
1,Previous Warning Is Correct,"The previous complaints were right-on. There will soon be clicking sounds and a problem turning the tv on, taking as long as 20 to 30 minutes until it just doesn't turn on. I researched this and there are tons of boards with complaints about the problem which boils down to cheap parts on the power board, of which Samsung will not take responsibility for. The cost to repair this is a few hundred, so just add this to the cost of this supposed ""deal"" of this television."
3,inferior parts,"We bought this samsung tv along with a smaller one around the same time. After 6 months of use the smaller tv started making clicking sounds, turned itself on and off, and failed to start. Thinking it was the remote we changed batteries and purchased a new remote. One day it just stopped working. I did some internet research and found this to be a problem with some of Samsung's tv's. We gave the tv to a family member who had it working after replacing the mother board. Soon after, we noted our larger Samsung 40inch tv was making similar clicking sounds. It began to take longer and longer for it to start. Currently, it takes 21/2 minutes of clicking before it will start. Although the color and pictures on the samsung tv's appear to be the best, we will never purchase another samsung tv. Today we purchased a LG tv......we are hoping this brand will do better than samsung."
4,cool,"I bought this cd not hearing any of the songs. Que te vas is a really good song, I love it. I imagine George Lamond will continue with tons of success in teh future with his salsa music, it rocks. He seems very true to his fans. I e-mailed him and he even wrote me back... that is awesome."
5,"Glad he finally recorded a Salsa album, GREAT VOICE!!!!","i've followed george lamonds career since his early pop/dance days(latin freestyle), and never has he sounded so vibrant and full of energy. the fact is, this boy can sing! other dance artists have tried and come up a little short, but this is definately not the case here. listening to the music and hearing his voice just makes me want to get up and dance!!!!!! I look forward to more releases of him in spanish!!!"
1,Another bad and Buggy EA game,"I've been playing this game since it came out about 1 1/2 months ago. Already had 3 patches in less than 2 months and the game still takes 15 minutes to load up. It crashes constantly - both due to servers and the game itself. EA has released a buggy, bad product in that it just doesn't work right and consistently. Cheaters are rampant now. Every game that I can play has roughly 25% of the players cheating. EA just can't stop the cheats"
4,Thecrazytrains,"Battlefield 2142 is a very fun game that has the same game play as Battlefield 2. Battlefield 2142 has new weapons, new maps, new vehicles and more new features, including the Titan mode which is a lot of fun. Both battlefield 2142 and Battlefield 2 are excellent games with excellent game play. I would recommend both, they are two different games with different goals."
2,No SPYWARE. Please.,I came to Amazon to buy the game but after reading the reviews decided not to spend the money. I will NOT purchase a game with ads and possible Spyware.
1,adware,was going to buy it until i heard it was linked with adware. a game with adware should be much cheaper or FREE!!
1,"Avoid this Game, tell EA why","I've been a long time player of various EA games and was looking forward to BF 2142, but with all the tricks EA is pulling on this one, I've decided not to purchase this title or any other title that makes use of the spyware tactics EA is imploying in this game. When a game has to include a FULL page ""warning"" about how it is collecting data on you, you know that a company has gone too far. Thanks for all the past great games EA, but you are now known in my books as ""Easily Avoidable"". Why a consumer would pay for a game and then still have to view ads in the game is beyond me and shows that EA doesn't care at all about the end user/gamer...only about themselves. DO NOT BUY."
1,Wait,"This is a mod, not a new game. Same engine with a few modifications does not make a new game. EA is just beating a dead horse trying to pull as much money as possible out of the original coding work. Oh, and there's advertising in the game. Also, there might be some spyware involved.Clearly the target market for this game is the overly gullible. Unfortunately this seems to be a large market."
4,good game,getting a little old but still a lot of funlove the upgrades you gain throughout the game.
1,IGA is SPYWARE,"Do not buy...and certainly do NOT install Battlefield 2142. Battlefield 2142 includes what is called IGA, or In Game Advertising. This is SPYWARE, and you do not get the option to install it or not. If you install this game, you also install the spyware! This spyware monitors your internet activity so that advertizers may target you with specific ads during game play of Battlefield 2142. It's obscene in my opinion to sell advertising in a game, and to use spyware to target a product to players! If we put up with this now, it will only get worse!"
1,Completely unplayable,"I've been trying to play this game for three hours now and I haven't even managed to get to a menu yet.First comes the login screen, which takes five to twenty minutes to log you in and completely locks up the application in the process (the cancel button doesn't work). Then, should the login actuall succeed, you get the pleasure of seeing a screen with some empty windows on it and no controls at all. There's no way to leave this screen short of cutting the power to the computer entirely.If I wanted to NOT play a game I could simply stare at my wall and save the forty bucks. This game is worthless."
2,"Fun Game, but EA's Lame","It's a really fun game from what I can tell, but be warned: not only does EA install what's basically a kind of spyware on your computer upon installation, but if you get a used version of this game you can't even play singleplayer without buying another cd-key online! (without doing something illegal) It asks you to log on to their servers to pair the cd-key to your user account, so you basically have a useless digital brick upon purchase of a used version unless the cd-key was never used for some reason.The gameplay itself (from what I've played of it) is pretty exhilarating and chaotic, and you should either get this or Battlefield 2--- not both (unless you're obsessed with battlefield games). It largely depends on how much you like or don't like titan mode. The graphics are dated by now, but still decent.All in all, the game itself is fun, but EA ruined used purchases. What a shame."
2,"Mediocre game, save your money","Figuring that I loved BF2, three years I rushed to buy BF2142 to play it in all its glory. Since that fateful day when I wasted a few days lunch money, I have spent few hours playing this game.Installing was a hassle, singing in to EA was a hassle, and playing was a hassle. I had to play for several hours before I could even figure out what was going on. Forget about doing well, that was too much work. Nevertheless, I stuck with it enough to be do well in matches, although I was never really satisfied. The balance of the game seemed off to me.Even though it is priced very low right now, I still do not recommend getting this game. I don't even know if people still play it - the servers might be empty. There are sites that track how many players are playing certain online games at once. I recommend checking those to see if people are still playing this game before buying it."
3,People Can't Read,"To start off this game does not have adware or spyware. Many people have said so but they could not be more wrong. If you have played any of the recent EA game such as NFS:MW, Burnout 3, NBA or FIFA you probably have noticed that there is some advertisement such as billboards or stores. If you have not noticed it go get your eyes checked.Now for the game, basically it is bf2 with a new skin. The gameplay is the same, the weapons are mostly the same with a few additions. After playing the beta and demo I think its better to stick with the original bf2 and its expansions."
2,A review by a bf2 player and a former 2142 player,"This is my 12-yr.-old son's review of this game: ""When I saw ads for this game, it looked great - finally a future-set,1st person shooter game. It was even in the Battlefield line. The game was good for a couple of weeks - until I decided to play Battlefield 2 again, which was great! There was actually a level with the sun-perfect vision for snipers. Even the vehicles were better. It was great to fly a jet again and play on a server that didn't lag (2142 people always moved the Titan and slowed the whole server down). Ranking up may not be as easy, but it gives the ranks more meaning. The only thing I will miss in 2142 is the buddy list."""
1,BUGGY AND SLOW INTERFACE,"I've bought this game full of anticipation, but it was a big turn down. I couldn't even start playing online because of the ""Buggyness"" of software in the first place. I didn't have any problems with the adds (didn't have a chance too see them) The multiplay menu worked once out of 20 tries, and it never updated the server list. When the server list appeared I could not connect to them. I am thinking about returning my battlefield 2142 and keep playing bf2."
1,DONT BUY USED,"IF YOU BUY THIS GAME USED IT WILL NOT WORK, IT WILL HAVE BEEN ALREADY REGISTERED AND WILL 100% SURE NOT WORKDONT MAKE THE SAME MISTAKE I DID"
1,some EA's reviewers here wont say anything bad on this game N Fact.,"I think this Game is the worst ever in BF previous versions and I prefer BF2 than this game which i think I made a big mistake when I bought it I had no problems logging and playing the game, sure with my high speed PC however ""the game "" itself is not that ""BF"" fans would expect , it is in one word can be described ""Disappointing"". I'm sorry EA ""reviewer"" but please stop writing here coz it's obvious hopeless.PS: not to mention the cool graphics !!"
1,SKIP BUY!,"I'll not buy a Spy $ ADwares programs, that's incredible. EA you are making the begining of the end for BF's zaga!"
4,Very good way to leave the real world behind ;-),"My job is pretty stressful and after several corporate restructurings the workload can encroach on your personal time and thought processes 24/7.But not when you're playing this game. A player needs to have all his senses focused on the game environment and his mental processes continuously churning out new strategy and tactics. The coordination with other squad members provides another point of focus that keeps you immersed in the world of 2142. The system of collecting points, awards, and promotions has kept me from falling into a rut since you must sample all the flavors of player types to move up the ranks.I play on a low medium level gaming PC (2.6Gig P4, 2.5Gig ram, AGP 6800 GeForce) and it doesn't seem to have much problem keeping up unless I crank up the graphics detail too much."
1,"Lots of fun, but not for Vista","Initially, I loved this game. I played it for about 2 straight months and had done well to level-up.I recently upgraded my system and in doing so went from Windows XP to Windows Vista.Battlefield 2142 under XP has a few bugs, but under Vista has tons of bugs. You basically can't play for than 30-90 minutes without a crash to desktop. It got frustrating to the point that I had to stop playing (because I didn't want to change back to XP). If you are running Vista, do not buy this game. It doesn't work well. I went through all of the ""tweak guides"" to try to minimize crashing and it still crashes.You can argue that BF 2142 wasn't designed for Vista, because it wasn't, but this is the only game I own that won't run on Vista. Other games I play such as WoW, CoH, C&C3;, & LOTRO run fine on Vista.So, I rate this game 5 starts for fun, but 1 star for running on Vista."
2,Plan on playing online or forget it.,"EA has moved the Battlefield series to an almost online exclusive game. Most weapons and abilities are locked and will stay that way until you play on one of EAs ranked servers and earned points to raise your stats and unlock content. You don't even get grenades right out of the gate. But if you play single player the AI will be chucking grenades at you constantly. And forget Titan mode. No bots there. I wonder if EA is looking to move games like this to a monthly subscription.Whatever. It's a decent online game. But EA, a lot of us really don't want to HAVE to play online with a bunch of spawn camping stat-mongers. Keep that in mind. I'm done buying Battlefield products."
1,JUST SAY NO TO SPYWARE IN GAMES YOU PAY FOR!,"I am outraged that EA inserts advertising into a game I pay good money for. This is bogus beyond belief, beyond the pale, unacceptable, outrageous. I returned it and so should you if you got taken like I was. If you are here wondering whether it is a good one to buy, the answer for now until they respond to the growing outrage over this is NO. JUST SAY NO to this kind of thing. VOTE with your WALLET because, THAT they listen to and nothing else. This incredible act of stupidy and greed on EA's part will kill this game and you won't have anyone to play with online anyway unless they issue a patch to yank this spyware right out of it COMPLETELY. Personally, I will be damned before I PAY for something that has SPYWARE in it and inserts ADVERTISING into MY game experience."
1,WARNING - Spyware and Adware,Absolutely the worst idea in years. Not only are you paying a premium price for this but they are adding mandatory advertisements in game as well as installing internet monitoring spyware on your computer. Of course there is NO warning on the box and only after you have opened it does the piece of paper telling you about it come to light. I returned my copy and refuse to support this out right attempt at invasive spyware.
1,Very dissapointed by inclusion of spyware/adware in 50 dollar game,"Spyware and Adware is not permitted on my home computer, so I will not be purchasing this game. I have carefully read IGA and EA's statement regarding spyware and their license agreement. EA's statement neglects to comment on many details that concern privacy advocates about this game, (they say what it doesn't do but they are not specific about what it does.) and the LICENSE AGREEMENT gives them permission to add even more spyware to the game in later patches, It also says that by installing the game, you agree give EA lawsuit immunity if the game harms your computer or violates your privacy. Why would they need this immunity if they were not afraid that some of the things they are doing are illegal?Don't give EA a blank check to make money off the information on your PERSONAL PC, and certainly don't pay them to do it to you.Too bad it seemed like a good game."
1,Ugh,The graphics are terrible. Slow gameplay. Empty servers all the time. This game was a complete waste of my money
1,Bad CD Key,"Bought it, installed and never able to register since it kept giving error about ""Invalid CD Key""Tried Contacting EA and 2 weeks later still no answer, Terrible Customer Service,Returned for refund."
2,Widescreen Support,"Unfortunately, Battlefield 2142 doesn't support native widescreen resolutions- at least, not right out of the box. There is a way to modify the shortcut to the game, but this takes a bit of work. So, if you have a widescreen monitor and you want to enjoy games that fill your screen, find an alternative to BF2142."
3,can't really say,"We very long time wanted to buy this game. And finally we spent 50 euro's (49.99 euro's) to buy this game. Installation was without any problems, but then surprises began.For three days we were tried to make it work, but absolutely useless. We have nVidia 128mb videocard. We installed new drivers for card (that was specially developed for such games). Again no luck. We read a lot of forums about this game. And seems about 50% of people, who buy it - have very problems with running this game.Minimal system requirements says that you need 128mb videocard. Smb managed to run it on 64mb without any problems. So with this game you can always have an element of surprise.So, we was very disappointed in this game, cause we simply couldn't play it. But in screenshots and video's looks really great. So we just re-sold it. If you not sure if this game will go on your comp - think some time before to buy it."
1,"One step forward, four steps back","The Battlefield series were great until 2142. Anticipated, you bet I did and then...in game advertising? Forget it. I have the Battlefield, expansion packs etc, but I will not buy this because of that in-game advertising/tracking.What sucks for some is that they installed the game without knowing and can no longer return it. I'm all for supporting legislation that will prohibit this kind of activity. EA/IGN - if they don't make it, someone else will. Plus with all the bugs/issues...sigh...why the headache.No one else I know, that plays the Battlefield series, has purchased 2142.Game Over EA...Game Over"
1,Flash drive?,"You say ""Buy Battlefield 2142 (DVD-ROM) and get Battlefield 2142 Pre-Order Flash Drive as a gift with purchase!"" -> $44.99.Where is my Flash drive? i don't receive anything!!!!!!!!!!"
1,Battlefield 2142 (DVD-ROM) - no thnk you,"In game ads? Must register on-line to use. NO THANK YOU. I did not open the box, I sent it back. I am not able to rate lower than 1 star.I love the reviewers who chalk it up as ""oh well, guess this is the way things will be"". Well only if you buy the product. If I can only participate in single player or on-line combat, slaughter and adventure by registering then I will go back to checkers. But I'm just prickly that way. It's MY money."
3,No BF2,"I bought this title on the strength of BF2. Yes, BF2 has given me lots of technical fits, but patches - lots of them - seem to have fixed everything. Plus, it looks gorgeous on a widescreen. 2142 was a disappointment. I don't care much for the gloomy surrounds, though i understand that they go with the ""plot"" of the game. It's drab, whether in the city or desert. The new character customization system is o.k., but it takes a while to get anything worthwile to fight with. Most importantly, I don't get the charge I get from spawning on a BF2 map. EA could have freshened up the future war theme and done something original, but much of this has been done before. The game has worked well for me, and I've had no server problems. Overall, o.k. but I find myself still enjoying Bf2 much more, especially with the boosters, new maps, and mods it offers."
1,Meh,"I think the only reason i liked this game is because i have never played any other bf games. People say this game is horrible dont buy it. I somewhat agree with it because adware sucks. My computer can run it just fine and its pretty fun. THE PODS ARE AWESOME. Vehicles are kinda cool except the driver shouldnt be able to pod out while 20 people are i nthe transport im seing that alot lately. Dont buy this ifyou already played the other bf2 games, as for me i dont got enought money :D"
1,wow,I was all ready to buy this game but after reading the reviews iam glad i didnt. 50 bucks is a lot to pay for having ur privacy invaded i wont be buying this title ever
1,Do you want to pay $50 for adware?,"I downloaded and played the Demo version of this game. In the demo the internet play was for some reason very laggy and the connection was droped quite often. I thought that the FIRST DAY PATCH might have fixed that and was going to buy it anyways.But, thankfully, I read the reviews and the forums before buying the game and found out that they have the adware/spyware ""feature"".It seems to me that it is ridiculous to pay 50 bucks for a bunch of adware!!! And it was not exactly advertised! People bought the game, opened the box and there's a nice surprise inside..."
1,"Sucks, doesn't work, EA is evil and stupid","What's in in-game ads for the player, anyway? It's the future and there's a war on, it doesn't even try to make sense. Way to choke, EA."
1,Avoid EA and their greed.,"The game itself is good, but not all that different from the last Battlefield game. It's essentially the same game in a futuristic setting. EA wants you to pay $50 for a rehashed game loaded with in-game ads and spyware? How about passing some of that advertising money along to the consumer instead of charging $50 for a polished up version of one of your old games?"
1,"Buyer Beware, This game will violate your privacy!","It has been reported and confirmed that this game will install software that will monitor your browsing habits and send this information to marketing companies. This spyware will NOT be optional! It is required to play the game. Think for a moment, do you want to pay $45 to have your privacy sold away to a marketing firm?"
2,BF 2 + 142 = Not fun,"If you thought BF2 has some lack of support, you'll be in shock from this one. They released a game that performs like it wasn't even ready for Beta testing. This is one game that I'll be passing on, having played it at my friends'. Titan Mode is so laggy that its almost unplayable, kicking people with low ping from games. And the ads are just obnoxious."
2,"Fun, but don't expect much that's new...","Don't get me wrong; Battlefield 2142 is fun, and when I have an hour to spare, I gladly immerse myself in the game. But it is really just another version of Battlefield 2. It includes the same commands and AI behavior as BF2, and the vehicles and weapons are very similiar. What separates this game from BF2 is the new Titan mode, which is cool, but probably isn't worth spending money on. In short, BF 2142 doesn't amount to much more than a BF2 mod. If you already own Battlefield 2, don't spend your money."
1,Do not buy this game.,EA is already making enough money off of the $50 BF2 mod that they should not be selling their customer's data. If everyone buys this game then EA will continue with this stupid practice. So please do not buy this game.
1,Dont buy this game you will thank me later!,Where to start...Well to be honest I can't even explain how poorly made this newest game from EA is made. To sum it up your paying $50 dollars for a poorly made modification of BF2. To add insult to injury the biggest new features of BF2142 have to be its spyware and adware technology. When you first open the box you will see a disclaimer saying something to the effect of a third party company will track what you do where you go and select ads to display based on this.STAY AWAY! You be better giving your $50 to charity(Where it will actually be used for a good cause...instead of feeding the pockets of EA and making you the customer feel like you have just been ripped off by a sleek salesman.)
1,"Very Buggy, Bloated, Poorly Made Game","I'm a very computer literite person so when I install a videogame I just bought I expect it to work right.... the first time. Battlefield 2142 did not even start up for me after installation on my brand new HP Laptop DV9000 with an Nvidia 7600 Go card. The entire installation process was litered with bugs. The microphone setup didn't even detect my audio setup even though it works perfectly fine in all other games and software (CS, Ventrilo).Adding salt to the wound is EA putting ads into this game. I know I will be returning this game and I'm pretty sure anyone who decides to buy this is taking a $50 gamble."
1,"Yes, what they say, is all true","The game itself is alright. It really is nothing more then a $50 mod of BF2. That by itself is pretty disappointing, and really makes it not worth $50. As far as all the talk about it installing spyware, believe it, it is true. EA even puts a disclosure card in the packaging. It scans your machine so it can place in game ads based on your surfing habits. This is completely unacceptable, even if it is indeed harmless. The fact that EA would even put in the effort to make a game do something like is, is troubling. They should spend more time and effort improving the game that the consumers pay for, then creating new ways to fill their pockets and exploit the consumer. What genious came up with this idea?"
3,Beware of Bugs,Game play while difficult for new people. The hard part is to get the game to start. Also a whole lot of bugs in game. EA should have waited at least 1 year more for release. For the price this is primarily a online game with not too many choices and steep learning curve.
3,Battlefield 2142,This is a great price and I love the game. EA has some issues with online game play at times which is irritating but most online games do. Overall this is a great game and I play it daily.
3,OK Game,"This was purchased as a gift and I was told the game was good, but the description made it sound more exciting than it is."
3,A great holiday chuckle,"My mom and sisters and I watch this video every Thanksgiving just to get a good laugh out of it. As usual, Martha's suggestions for holiday entertaining are completely ridiculous for the average person. You do get a good look around her house and its many rooms full of baskets, dishes, and all the usual Martha accoutrements. I recommend this video purely for its laugh factor!"
5,Favorite CD of the moment,"I love this CD. The music is so well done, exciting and unique. It has many dramatic changes in song structure, which are done seamlessly. The singer has an unusual and very expressive voice, and he is able to do a lot of different things with it. He has a great scream that sounds like no one else.I especially like the gradual build to an emotional conclusion in ""Bloodgiver"", and ""Ma Jolie"" just makes me smile. The music has somewhat the feel of At The Drive In, but is still very original. I've introduced a lot of friends to this band, and everyone likes them."
3,great michigan band.,"i don't know if these guys ever got the recognition they deserved, but they put out some great tunes. i remember busses/no busses being a standout. very talented guys, a must for anyone that liked at the drive-in during their in-casino/out days."
5,Fine cookware bargain,"Was trying to make the commitment to purchase the All Clad LTD saucier.Kept reading the reviews to the Kitchen Aid and decided I did not want to spend twice the price on the All Clad. Thhis saucier does not disappoint in any way. Shaped well, easy to clean, beautiful and cooks like a dream! Love it!"
3,HELPING THE DUMMY,"Yes, that's right, GTO is back and shows a soft side in this fifth volume. His dim-witted student, Tomoko, or as her classmates call her, Slo-mo-ko, has been dissed and treated as a slave by her so-called friends. GTO decides to help her become all she can be by becoming her producer and all around promoter. Her first gig is to enter a contest to become a model for an city park ad campaign. Also in this volume we have the continued campaign of the school principal to fire GTO even as he continues his perverted behavior of touching women improperly on the subway. We are also introduced to one of GTO's fellow teachers, Teshigawara, who just happens to be slightly insane, who just happens to be obsessed with Azusa Fuyutsuki, who just happens to be in love with GTO, even though she wont admit it to herself. The GTO series continues to entertain but is beginning to lack the edge that it started with in favor of sentimentality."
4,South Florida Flavor,"This collection of songs reminds me of growing up in South Florida, where the living was easy along the Gulf of Mexico beaches. The flavor of ""Just Say Joe"" brings back memories of tropical breezes, warm Gulf waters, and the magical ""green flash"" as the sun sets over the water. This whole CD is a wonderful nostalgic trip, and I enjoy listening to it to take me back to those carefree days. Bravo !"
5,Laid back and rockin,"I have always been a fan of Rock-In-Roll tied in with a bit of Blues and that is what you get here. After listening to this release and taking in all the sutleties, I must admit that I was impressed. Whether you like Jimmy Buffet of CSNY you will be satisfied. You know a great CD when you and your family can just sit back on a long drive and relax. Joe has a way of taking you up, rocking your soul and gently giving you a chance to come down to recharge your batteries. My favorite cut is ""You've Got to Want to Do It"". It is an awesome display of mood and beat. My 5 year old daughter aspires to being a ""Joe-ete"". The ""Man Just Wants To Rock""- just incredible and ""Lord I'm Stranded"" reminds me of my life in the wrong lane asking for help. Overall this Florida boy has put it all together with a great debut CD."
4,Take the beach whereever you go,This CD will end those tiresome arguments of what music will satisfy all members of the family. Take it on the beach or take it out in the back yard and DREAM you are on the beach. The music truly lets you escape.
4,THE JIMMY BUFFET OF THE MILLINEUM!,I REALLY LIKED THIS CD AS IT HAS AN ISLAND SOUND ON SOME SONGS AND REMINDS ME OF A JIMMY BUFFET STYLE OF SINGING. ITS RAW AND ORIGINAL AND HAS NOT BEEN TOO SYNTHESIZED BY STUDIO MUSICIANS AND ITS CONTENT IS GREAT! ALL YOU NEED WITH THIS CD IS A MARGARITA AND A BEACH! THIS SINGER/SONGWRITER SHOULD BE ON HIS WAY TO FAME!
2,PC Game with a Problem,"I got the Shrek the third PC for my birthday present. I fought this game was going to be interesting. Even though I installed it just fine, and it works on our computer, this game often freezes our computer. Usually when this frezzing problem happens I usually have to turn off the computer and start the level all over again. Occasionally, this game erases files all by itself. Sometimes I could not pass the level because it usually freezes in the middle of a level. The graphics were good, the characters were funny. I WOULD NOT RECCOMMEND THIS GAME BECAUSE IT OFTEN FREEZZES OUR COMPUTER!!! BUY ANOTHER GAME!!!"
5,really fun,this game is awsome and they add the werewolve and the game is just so fun with pets in your house
4,So Much Fun!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I love this game this has a wide variety selection of pets. Large dogs,small dogs and cats. You can even create your own pets,style their color,choose collar.The only problem is going to the pet store and buying items. How do you get water for your pets but they do drink their urine. Have fun!!!!!!!!!"
5,SIMS 2 PETS,"THIS IS A LOT OF FUN. YOU CAN CREATE PETS AND YOUR SIMS CAN TRAIN THEM TO DO TRICKS. THE PETS CAN ALSO GET JOBS! THE PETS ARE A LOT OF FUN. THERE ARE CATS, DOGS, PARROTS, AND A GUINEA PIG TOO. I REALLY ENJOY WATCHING THE PETS INTERACT WITH THE SIMS. YOU WILL ENJOY IT TOO!"
5,what i like best,sims 2 pets is awsome. i think it helps kids to understand how to live with a pet. all the breeds of cats and dogs are truely amazing. the unique design of a cat or dog is fun to fiddle with.improvement:if it needs to be improved i think it needs to be imroved on the clothes.a sim needs a good variety of clothes but apart from that all the sims games are cool!
3,Not the best!,You get bored so quickly. It's fun at first but after a while not so much! I would not reccomend if you get bored easy!
3,Sims 2 Pets,"Ok expansion pack,if you want more things for your Sims to take care of then this is the expansion pack for you. Ok Buy."
5,good game,I got this for christmas. Here's a hint for all of u with a slow sims 2 or sims 2 pets game. Buy more ram. we did and it helped a lot. It won't take 30 minutes to get to a neighborhood or a lot or downtown anymore. more like 1..if that long even. anyways this game is great. and the pets are adorable. when an old cat moved in to a lot she died in a few hours sim time. and it was sad cuz her son was sitting by her grave all the time. it made me wanna cry. anyways this is a great expansion. buy. but i strongly suggest buy more ram. this game takes up a lot of memory.
3,fun..but bad too,This is an ok game.The bad part is the pets your sims get either rip up your furniture or go to the bathroom everywhere!They also complane at night!
2,......Buy Open For Bussiness Instead,I bought it 2 days ago and reutrned it today for a full refund.I thought you could actually control the pet and make it do fun stuff.Actually you can't even command it to move.WHAT KIND OF PET IS THAT???!!!Only a small variety of breeds.The only lest bit fun of it is that you can custom design your pet.THE UPSIDE-You can open up a pet store if you have thisTHE DOWNSIDE-You also have to have business to do thatBIG DISSAPOINTMENT MAXIS YOU GET 2 THUMBS DOWN:(
5,The Sims 2 Pets Expansion Pack,"I love the pets... my only wish is if the ""humans"" sleep the pet would too. Makes time move slow... but a resourceful person finds ways around this :)"
3,ok,"my kid loves sims, but these pets take a long time to set-up and are kind of creepy looking. limited in what you can do with them."
4,"Fun, but really slows down your computer!","Having pets for your Sims is fun, but that's about all this pack offers. There are few new objects. I guess I expected more, with this being an actual expansion pack.I never had much of a problem with the speed of my Sims until I installed Pets. Now, the game ""hangs"" at certain times (while loading a house, when a Sim turns into a werewolf, after a pet comes home from work with a promotion, etc.). It is very annoying, and the game overall has slowed to the point of it being unenjoyable.I hope to get a new computer soon. Hopefully, that will help. But I wish that the minimum requirements on the box had been adjusted. Yes, the game will run with the minimum requirements. But it won't necessarily be fun to play."
4,Great Edition!,I loved this because it's making it more realistic which is what I LOVE about the Sims (I'm into that life simulating stuff) and it's alot of fun to have pets around! Put I get overly tired of them destroying the furniture. So it all most becomes a pain but I guess pets can do that.
3,Ehhh...,"So I love the Sims and The Sims 2 and own all of the expansions, but overall I believe that the Sims 2 Seasons and The Sims 2 Pets are two of the weakest.Do not get me wrong, there are good points to this expansion, but they are not really worth the bad points.I love the added aspect of having a pet, being able to own a pet store, getting your pet a job and all that, but really, it is almost the same as having a kid in the game, just one that is fuzzy and walks on all fours.Also, this expansion, along with Seasons are two that really can slow your game a lot. The load time more than doubled for me when I added this expansion. I played it for awhile, then took it off of my system because it really did not add enough to the life of my Sims to bother with. Also, the added stray animals are really just annoying as all get out.If you are a fan, it is worth checking out to see if you like it or not. My wife really like this expansion. I do not."
4,Expansion Pack adds new aspects of playability,"I do like this expansion pack. I find the pets to be a lot of fun. This game is glitchy, so make sure you patch it at [...] so your pets don't get stuck in the floor and such. I like having children train the pets. They enjoy it, build social with the animal, and its awfully cute to see toddlers hug the pets. Free crazy cat lady with purchase!"
3,Somewhat disappointing,"The Pets expansion pack is not much of an expansion. You get an animal whose best assets are some fictional ability to go to work each day. Sort of like a Sim but with 4 legs and about the same un-discernable language as typical of a Sim. Pets kept me interested for a few hours a day over a week. My cat became an actor. He became breadwinner. It was great. Then he died. But then so did my interest in the game. If you are quick with games, wanting to finish goals and WIN: Pets may bore you. If you are a longtime fan who collects these games and has a budget for expansion packs, this ones for you."
3,The Sims 2 Pets Expansion Pack,Lots of fun but had to do some technical software mods to get the game to play using a video card from about 2001. It all works though.
5,Wonderful EP!,"I am a bit biased, since I love anything having to do with the Sims, and Sims2, but I was so glad to see pets added to the game! And they're so cute!!! It's a great EP!"
4,"This was a must-buy for me, but don't purchase through Amazon!","Amazon actually sent me 2 copies of the game, when I ordered only one, and charged me for both, but would not refund me the cost of shipping on the extra! So, I will never again purchase anything from Amazon or its affiliates. Who knows when they will make more mistakes that they refuse to fix?I love playing the Sims 2 and the Pet Expansion will help you to complete your sim families whether that means cats, dogs, birds, hamsters, or fish!"
3,Sims 2 Pets Expansion Pack,Bought game for my son but he hasn't gotten to play his gift game yet. He has played the game previously though and enjoyed it.
2,issues with the game,"Cute and fun, but I couldn't combine Pets and Seasons on my computer.However, the biggest problem with Pets is that whenever any member of the house, including pets, is home and awake, time runs on normal. This includes days and night when humans are working or sleeping, but a pet is awake. Unfortunately when I fast forward the time, my computer tends to crash. Not worth it to me, sorry Pets. I still love you but you've been uninstalled1"
3,ITS ALL RIGHT,bETTER THE OTHER GAMES OF SIMS BEFORE THE PETS. DOSEN'T HAVE THAT MUCH INTERACTION.Great delivery. tHANKS GUYS
4,Great gift!,"Was purchased as a gift for a family member, she said it works great and she absoultly loves it! Thanks"
3,.........,"i was kinda disapointed but its still fun, kinda hard to mange ur animals but still fun, but... they should have more animals other than dogs cats birds womrats, i was thinkin bunnies and on the offical website every1 else agrees...but its still fun kinda disapointment"
3,Great But Dissapointing,"Sims 2 pets is a great don't get me wrong. But it is a little dissapointing because u can't control the pets u have 2 use a cheat code (i haven't tried that yet!!) I'ts fun cause u can have colored pets of blue,red,green,yellow&many more colors.Lots of collars to choose from and earn"
3,Before the Rains,"Interesting story of English ruling in India. Amazing scenery. This movie has a story within a story - building a road, story of the gun, story of our main character's affair and the death of his lover. I'm still trying to figure what happened to Moores at the end of movie. He's sitting in the rain in the middle of the road and then, suddenly, he just gone. Did he leave India, was he also killed - what happened to him. The movie left that unfinished."
4,Well Acted,"The acting was well done. It was an interesting view of the time period and the cultural differences. Not a happy movie, but worth watching."
3,Good setting but sad story,"This 2007 British film takes place in India in 1937. The rich landowner is having an affair with the servant woman. It all seems lovey dovey but when the wife returns, he sends her away. She is surprised because the landowner had told her he loved her. The landowner has a loyal Indian man working for him; he even gives him a gift of a gun. And when he sends the servant girl away, he depends on the servant man to see that she doesn't come back. What follows is a tragedy for all concerned.The setting is done well. I really felt it depicted India well. The acting was also excellent. However, I found myself revolted by the behavior of the landowner. And the story got so boring that I actually fell asleep. I cannot recommend this film at all."
5,"Fun, Fun Story",Kids love the imaginative events in this book. To think it could happen - OH MY! Tedd Arnold's text and illustrations make every page fun!
2,Could have been more,"I had heard that this book was a real gem, but when I got it and read it to my 5 year old, we felt there could have been a bit more humor. I guess we expected these to be more like Arnold's Parts and More Parts which are hysterical and highly entertaining."
4,No Jumping On The Bed,"Author: Tedd ArnoldWhen Walter starts jumping on the bed his Dad tells him, ""Don't jump on the bed or you might fall through the floor."" I don't think the little boy wants to stop jumping on the bed. The author seems to understand what kids can go through and I hope there are other people who want to read this book to their kids. This is a very creative book and I think that someone who can write a book and somehow know almost everything a kid will do, must really understand kids. Tedd Arnold is a very creative person. I would read this book to my little brothers, sisters and cousins because it's a very good book and it's appropriate for children eight and younger."
5,Great story and pictures!!!!!!,"Lovely pictures, and great story which gently gets your toddler/preschooler to think about why they shouldn't be jumping on the bed! Great fun."
4,Frequently requested,"This is a basic cumulative tale. Walter finally jumps so high he falls through the floor, and as he goes on more and more residents of his apartment building fall with him, down and down in a rhyming fashion.Eventually Walter wakes up - just in time for his upstairs neighbor to fall on top of him.The absurdly calm quips everybody makes as the whole building falls in on top of them are worth reading all by themselves.I will note that this is a very long, pretty involved book. It might not be suited for very young children, under the age of four or so."
3,Darshana,"I was disappointed with the pronunciation of the sanskrit words - they seem to be too westernised and the correct sanskrit pronunciation lost.When I was confused about the pronunciation and read the actual verse written in sanskrit, the pronunciation of the words were different.The musical rhythm and pitches important to the vedic chants are preserved though.But for anyone interested in learning the correct pronunciations, it does not serve well."
2,Darshana,Was surprised. Was not expecting such a 'western sanscrit'. It does not flow for me.... the mantras get stuck somewhere in the back of my mind looking for the sweetness of the sanscrit language.
1,Not what I expected,I entered the specifications for memory for my Dell Inspiron laptop. Supposedly that is what I ordered but not what I received.
3,remote car start,"confusing and should not be installed by anyone other than professionals. good for you if you installed your own radio, but that doesn't make you an electronic professional"
5,This is an almost perfect CD!,"Massacre is an emotional masterpiece. ""Pining Away""makes my heart ache - it is very intense. This is an excellent discto listen to while driving. Buy it! Be different! Don't conform! You won't be sorry."
5,EXCELLENT!,"This book is excellent in teaching both Spanish in Spanin, and Spanish in South America. I have just finished the Lecciones Preparatorias (Prepatory Lessons), and I'm now moving on to Chapter One. I have bought many books that claim to teach you Spanish but this one by far is the best! There is a story all in Spanish in the beginning of each chapter with questions to answer about it, information about the Spanish culture, famous art by Spanish artists, tons of illustrations, and famous American comics like Charlie Brown and Dennis The Menace in Spanish! I highly reccomend this book for any age! By the way, I don't think that it skips around illogically like other people said. Anyway,¡Buena suerte con Español!"
4,Learning by Story Telling,"This book is great for learning Spanish by use of telling stories. It will make you a good Spanish reader. Unfortunately there isn't many listening and verbal exercises within these pages. Therefore, you will need to fine sources for these 2 important parts of learning a language.Tom Troughton ""Editor of www.fantasticospanish.com"""
4,learningespanol,We are using this book in my spanish class. The stories are fun and improve your vocabulary. There are enough exercises to help you learn the material.
2,Difficult to follow due to choppy flow of information.,This in my view is a poorly written text book. There is no organization and author(s) just seem to jump around from topic to topic at will. Poor illustrations and examples are also plentiful. This could easily be used as an example of instuctors selecting books based on profit rather than quality.
3,AFX - 2 Remixes By AFX,"AFX shows off more of his remixing skills on 2 REMIXES BY AFX, a short EP. The mix of 808 State's ""Flow Coma"" is pure electro heaven, and DJ Pierre is given a speedy acid workout. And although I haven't deciphered the last track, as a matter of sonics, it's pretty fascinating, though I really wouldn't play it at a party."
5,Pagoo,"Pagoo is one of my favorite children/science books. Holling Clancy Holling is a wonderful author and created a series of great books for children, as well as adults, you will both learn so much! All of his books take you on a journey or life story of the main character, in this case Pagoo(abbreviated from the correct biological name) is the life story of a hermit crab. I used to read one page a night to my boys, and one page alone is filled with so much information and illustrations you'll see why. I swear both my boys, now young men, have a tremendous sensitivity to the earth and all its creatures and I believe some of this was because of the wonderful perspective Holling Clancy Holling gave them. We read all of his books, but Pagoo, Minn of the Mississippi(a female snapping turtle's tale) and the most famous Paddle to the Sea(the journey of a small wooden Indian in a canoe) were our favorites!"
5,My favorite book from childhood,"Of all the many books I read as a child, this one stands out as the best children's book I encountered. It awakened a keen interest in the biology of the sea that I keep to this day, in the form of scuba diving, fishing, and maintaining a reef aquarium with, yes, hermit crabs! This is just a wonderful book with beautiful illustrations and can awaken a sense of wonder in a child for the natural world that a parent can follow up with a visit to the seashore. This book can make the water come alive and get a child thinking about the life beneath the waves. Don't miss it."
5,A fascinating story of one tiny life in the ocean!,"I am an elementary school teacher and I remember Pagoo from my own childhood. The illustrations and details make this little hermit crab's adventure not only a thrilling story, but also a work of art. I use this book today in my own classroom to talk about themes such as growing up and the life cycles of animals. This is a very old book, but it is among the classics. Buy it for your child's library today!"
3,Still holds up after 30 years....,"I remember my 4th grade teacher read this to a group of restless, bored kids, that is until we all (well, most of us) became enthralled by Pagoo. I suddenly remembered this title 30 years after being introduced to it by my teacher at Francis Scott Key Elementary School in San Francisco in 1972, Mrs. Marjorie Parkhurst. My 6-year old daughter is currently fascinated by sea creatures (as I was at her age), tide pools and such, and recently acquired a pet Hermit Crab after relentlessly hounding me for one. I'm sure she'll enjoy it as much as I did. If not, well, then I'll have to look up Mrs. Parkhurst and blame her for being a much better storyteller than I am! ;)"
4,Great vocabulary,"We are loving this book as a living science resource, instead of using textbooks. My kids retain the vocabulary so well, even my three year old told my husband plankton means wandering."
1,"Umm, well, maybe for younger kids ....","I read this book with my class in fifth grade because we were studying marine life. I admit, it was informational. It was kinda cute, in some parts, i guess. But, honestly! No offense to my fifth grade teacher, but steer clear of this book if your anywhere over 8!"
5,Wonderful book!,I bought this book after reading other Holling C. Holling books. The book is wonderful! The pictures are good and the story is excellent. What I love about Mr. Holling's books is that they can be used multi-level. Even my 3yo was interested in learning about Pagoo the Hermit Crab.
5,I read this book several times as a child.,I loved Pagoo as a child and have just read it to my two boys. It is a wonderful story of a little hermit crab and his adventures while growing up in a tide pool by the sea.The illustrations are beautiful. A must for any young reader interested in ocean life.
5,Lots of fun!,"Just read this book for the joy of reading! It is so great! You will have a tough time not reading it from cover to cover once you start it. The writing style is so darn enjoyable, the characters very real, even the talking crystal skull, Crane! Don't let this one get by you!"
3,Two weeks of failing as a part-time father,"Sad tale of a father who loves his kids, gets custody for only two weeks a year, and fails miserably at being a father during those two weeks. He doesn't do anything to intentionally harm them or put them in danger but almost every choice he makes does so just because he is incapable of considering consequences or of putting their needs ahead of his own desires and impulses. The film proceeds along a low tech near-mumblecore path which suits the subject well."
1,Why no oz. size on this product?,I do not understand why there is no ounce size on this product. Why does it just list medium size jar or large ...Is it a secret on the ounce size? I have not ordered this product so my opinion on the product is of no value.
1,bilberry tea,it tasted awful almost stale and old and it smell bad .will not buy again bilberry tea was not for me even with all the great benefits.
1,"Bilberry tea, disgusting!","Ordered this type of tea because I saw on Dr. Oz's website that this tea supposedly helps with cravings if you drink it in the afternoon. The taste is bad, horrible! I had to add some honey to makeit taste a bit better. Tried this for 4 days in a row and it didn't aid in cravings, cravings as in food cravings. This tea sucks. I also read on other websites that if consumed long term, may have side affects. Discontinuing this tea for sure."
1,Suggested by Dr. Oz,"This tea was suggested by Dr. Oz on his show about how to sleep better. I suffer from insomniaso I bought the wheat germ, Chia seeds and Valerian tea he said would help. Haven't used the wheat germ yet, the Chia seeds we are absolutely loving, especially on top of a crisp salad, but the Valerian tea tastes so horrible I can't even force myself to sip it while holding my nose! It has a real earthy, almost ""manure"" like taste. The woman he had try it on the show sipped it and said ""Oh, that's not bad!"" So I took a chance. I swear, they must have paid her to give it a tasty review. It's vile and I already threw all three boxes of it in the trash!"
3,"Ok, but...","The tea bags are poorly perforated. You have to use extra special care to find the end of the tea bag and then very gingerly pull it apart so you don't inadvertantly rip into the adjoining bag, wasting it."
3,Its Okay,"Bilberry taste a lot like the berry of similar spelling. To put it straightly it tastes a lot like a slightly tart blueberry. They may be a simplistic view of this tea, but I think that is a universal flavor identification that everyone can agree with. I like tea, and this one is not bad. It is definitely different and I might say worth trying out to see if you like it. Bilberrys are of course high in anthocyanins which is the same powerful antioxidant behind recent health fads as the acai berry and black raspberry.Pros:+Healthy+Unique tasteCons:-Unique tasteOverall three stars. Remember that three stars means it just okay, I am not hammering this product as I am sure some people will very much so enjoy it. If you are taking it for health purposes than I am sure you won't mind the taste at all as it is great tasting for medicine."
2,try it YOU might like it,I saw this product recommended on Dr Oz show for kidney health so I gave it a try.the taste is not to my likeing so I am trying to ween my way into it .it is an aquiered taste so if you are adventurest and want to try something new than go for it.not really for me though .good luck
3,product is good,"product is good but packaging was not !!! box came crushed...This did not affect the product in anyway, but when your paying for somthing you expect it not to come crushed.."
1,magnesium stearate abounds within,"if you have misgivings about magnesium stearate, don't buy this product. it's a white powder packed with the tea bags that you need to do your research on before you decide about it. i have decided against it after reading various diverse views."
2,Red Clover Tea 30 Bags,The Red Clover Tea 30 Bags is over priced and it does nothing for me. Try the health food loose peppermint tea for $1.40 per oz. and the tea holder is $2.50.
2,Unpleasant Taste,I bought this hoping it would reduce my allergy symptoms but it did not. I also do not like the taste of this tea.
5,Saw this on Dr. OZ for eliminating crows feet,"I watched Dr. OZ on television and he was explaining how to minimize and/or avoid crows feet. His advice? Drinking Fenugreek tea, taking L-Arginine supplements and getting a good nights' sleep (6 hour min.). Well, I am going to give it a shot. This tea has an interesting taste-not your typical tea but not bad. It tastes pretty good with a bit of honey added actually. I wasn't able to find this tea in any local supermarkets but here it is on Amazon. Seems they have everything!"
4,Good night sleep,"I purchased these tea bags in hope for a good night sleep. The first night I drank it, I slept great. I have continued to drink this every night and I still sleep well but I find myself waking up in the middle of the night once in a while. I do find myself urinating more often so maybe it is cleaning me out. No bad side effects, tastes good alone, no sugar or honey needed. I recommended this to my family and co workers and they all love it. I discovered this from Dr. Oz. Hoping to continue to sleep well."
5,"Works, economical alternative to other 'diet' teas","This stuff works. As reported by real doctors, do not use this all the time, only when needed. Listen to what your body is telling you."
1,It never came,"I've had this tea before, and it does the trick. Tastes nasty, but gets you sleepy. Unfortunately, this past order from, Nutricity, never showed up. I wrote to them and their response was inadequate. I wrote again, and they ignored me. Luckily, Amazon gave me a refund."
5,nice product,"In ayurvedic medidicne and in yoga exxercises some times you need to use herbal meds for balancing the chakras and energy channels, so this is one of the needed onesbut please use under instruction of your yoga and ayurvedic teacher"
1,Do not order this product....,"It has been over three weeks and I still have not received this product. And, they have charged me for it already..."
2,"Don't pay for ""expedited"" delivery","I paid over $13.00 for ""expedited"" delivery and the product still took FIVE days to arrive. Would not buy from them again."
2,,"I only used two maybe three tea bags and got pregnant - can not drink during pregnancy. Not a bad taste, but I'm not a big tea fan either."
3,Strong!,The fragrance of this tea is wonderful. The taste is strong and spicy which I don't care for so at first I tried adding honey. The honey made it taste disgusting. So the next night I added 1% low fat milk which made the taste more tolerable. It also seems to make me drowsy so I drink it near bed time.
3,YUK,This stuff tastes really gross. Never got the chance to see if it even worked. I even put honey and and tea flavor in it. Tasted way to bad.
1,fenugreek Seed Tea,It tasted horrible. I couldn't stand to drink it without lots of sugar By adding all that sugar I was defeating it's propose.
1,Terrible Taste,"I would love to say that this tea was great, but unfortunately it tastes terrible. I read many reviews and most people said it had a tolerable taste, I would like to know these other people are eating in comparison. I added lemon juice, sugar, cranberry juice…anything recommended to make it taste better, but nothing helped. I would recommend that you just take the pill supplement instead.This is in no was a reflection on the seller, they were great, fast shipping, but the tea was gross!!"
5,Perfect!,"Just what I needed to start toning my uterus for labor! It tastes great and brews strong. I love that the ingredients are : Red Raspberry Leafs. That's it. No filler, no junk."
4,Great product.,"this is a great product,it helps to relieve my bloating.I will order it again.Thank you.its better then anything else i have tryed"
2,Not as fresh as expected,I was quite disappointed in the lack of freshness of the Bilberry Tea. It has a stale flavor that I've not encountered in other Bilberry Teas.
3,Would you like a cup of 'fish' tea?,"Bilberry....it sounded so...so....tasty. I am sure that this tea is good for your health and for that reason I give it the 3 stars. Unfortunately, it smells and tastes like fish which is something I just cannot tolerate. I tried it several times and just could not drink it. I have a close friend who is Asian and she likes it, but she eats a lot of fish sauce so I guess her tastebuds are adapted to that taste. Not mine. I would also say that I am not a finicky eater (I do eat fish), and I do tolorate a lot of tastes for the sake of eating healthy, including eating things on the bitter side - but 'fishy' is hard for me to swallow! So, for now, I will have to try something else. Anyone know what hawthorn berry tea taste like?"
3,Just O.K.,"It doesn't taste great but since I'm not taking it for taste, more for health reasons I suppose it's an okay product."
2,useless - I feel no effects whatsoever,"I'm not a tea drinker, so I'll start with that right off the bat. However, I was reading online about some non-medication ways of coping with a stuffy nose. One of them mentioned Mullein tea as a natural remedy to combat mucus, so I schlepped down to my local health food store to buy a box of 24 tea bags, for about a buck more than they are here on Amazon. Not only did drinking this tea 3-4 times a day for a couple days have ZERO effect on my stuffy nose, but this was the worst cold/cough/flu I've had in about 10 years. Obviously I can't prove that this was BECAUSE of the tea, but I am convinced that I wasted my money on this useless product, and that, at least for me, it provided absolutely no results for anything. Sorry."
4,"Bad taste, but helps you fall asleep",I bought this to help me fall asleep and it works although it tastes and smell really bad. Make sure to put this in some sort of a glass jar to prevent your kitchen from stinking. I found that if i added cream to this tea it would help the taste but its still pretty bad.
1,billbery tea,"The tea tastes absolutely horrible, but according to Dr Oz, it is supposed to be a belly fat buster. I have not lost any inches like the ladies in the article said they did. I will continue to take until all is gone, if I can hold my breath long enough each time to finish the 8 oz at my meal."
1,Horrible,I didn't see the reviews about the smell of this product before buying. Saw it reviewed on Dr. Oz and thought I would try. It was horrible! I couldn't stomach the smell to make it let alone drink it! It smells so horrible I was afraid of it coming through my pores and left a nasty smell on my fingers from getting it out of the box.
2,Health product,It wasn't what I expected and I'm a little concerned with the powder residue outside the package within the box that seemed excessive. I haven't got sick from this tea but just concerned and wondered if that was to be expected. The results are hard to determine as I settled for this tea versus another that wasn't available. I guess it's doing about as much as what you could expect.
1,Nasty stuff,"This stuff taste the worse, no sweetner helps and it stinks up the place...Stay away from this stuff, what a waste of money."
2,Tastes horrible,"I tried about 3 of these tea bags & threw the rest out, they taste horrible, like musty old earth.I don't recommned it to anyone.I love green tea... this just tastes nasty, even tried putting lemon & honey in it, but it's still awful."
2,No taste or flavor,I had a hard time drinking this tea as it tastes like cardboard! There's no taste or flavor. I don't know if it actually works to strengthen the uterus as I wasn't able to make myself have it for the couple of months required. I'm not sure if all raspberry tea tastes like this or just this brand.
5,Earthy and comforting,"Its a really delicious earthy, herbal tea. Every cup makes me feel warm and comfy. I love it! his will definitely be a repeat order."
5,ginger tea,i love this tea. i do not drink hot tea but i use it cold from the fridge. i drink more of this tea than water.
1,YUCK!,"These tea bags were old and rancid. I thought maybe the bags just smelled bad, but the prepared tea tasted old and rancid as well. I am glad that I did not give this as a gift."
2,Red clover tea,I bought this product hoping that it would ease my hot flashes. Consistently used this product for a few months with no changes or let up of hot flashes.
4,Good Tea,"This is a tea tastes really good (I only add a little sugar to it). I started taking it to help get ready to produce milk (I want to nurse my son when he arrives). For now I can't tell you if it's helped with that since I'm still waiting for him to arrive. However, even if you aren't expecting, it's still good for you and has a nice mild berry taste, not overpowering. I do wish the bags had tags on them so they were easier to ""fish out"" of the mug, but I've found many of my favorite teas don't have those handy tags on them."
3,Sage Tea - helping with hot flashes,"When I bought the first box I had a cup of tea every night and thought the hot flashes subsided a bit, so I bought another box. The second box, not so much. I am not sure if the tea builds up in your system and stops working or if it is just me. The tea does not have a bad taste, doable for its purpose. Sage tea has been recommended by many as a means of cutting down hot flashes, vs taking meds that can be linked to cancer. Give it try, it might work for you."
5,Love spearment tea,I bought this product and love the flavor. A great and relaxing way for me to end or begin a day.
4,Senna Leaf tea,"A friend suggested this as I have been taking pain medication which tends to bind the bowels. He told me that this would help keep me regular. He was so right. A cu p of Senna Tea with my dinner has been better then metamucel for regularity. It tastes good, and I recommend it to anyone who has constipation problems due to medications. If you eat out, you can take the tea bag with you and ask for a cup of hot water to steep your tea in, and you do not have to worry about missing a dose."
3,I'll pass...,"Not enough flavor, murky brown color, lacking in aroma. I enjoy other varieties from this line but prefer a different brand of rose hip tea. I'd drink it over regular black tea though."
4,not very delicious but effective,"took some getting used to--at first I joked that it tasted like a liquid crouton. after a while, though, you get used to the taste. took it for health reasons...whether it was the tea or something else, the issue went away. definitely not something I'd drink every day but if necessary, it's tolerable.note: putting honey in it makes it worse. and hot is preferable to iced."
1,"If you don't like curry, don't bother",Fenugreek Seed tea smells and tastes awful. I don't like the taste or smell of curry and this reminded me of it very much. I could not drink even one cup and I have several candles burning trying to get the smell out of my apartment!
5,great product,I bought this tea to follow the Dr. Oz Tea Diet I found in a magazine. Seems to be working.
1,Tasteless!,"I used to get ""Juniper Ridge Juniper Ridge White Sage & Wild Mint Tea"" and LOVE it with a hint of raw honey and I wanted to give this tea a try. Very disappointed- the tea was tasteless and not what i had expected."
1,Fish tea,"I know nettle tea has a pretty distinct taste, but this particular brand was just unbearable. The smell reminded me of fish food pellets, and it had a fishy taste, too. I bought a pound of loose nettles from somewhere else for a lot cheaper, and the taste is so much better."
1,This is the foulest Tea ever,These reviews are wrong.It may work but I could not swallow this disgusting swill. I have many Teas. Let me describe this one. Get compost from a gardening store and brew that in a french press. The burnt leaf taste is pungent. Take the pills and buy some earl grey.
1,"Weak, wimpy, worthless",This tea is weak at best when compared to other rose hip teas I have tried. The bags have no string and tag. The bags are the limpest and often fall apart while squeezing. The only brand of tea I have ever had do this. I drink 4 to six cups of tea a day of various types and this is a very lame tea.
1,This stuff Smells so baaaad,This tea smells so bad I cant get the smell outta my house. I know Valerian root doesn't smell like roses but this smell is putrid. The affects work ok but not the best
5,"Hetrbal Teas,Chamomile",This is an outstanding product!! The test is great and lives up to it's ancient name Roman Apples. Altogether a warm comfortable taste and calming nature.
2,Not my cup of tea..,"Supposedly increases milk production? Yeah, I didn't see a difference after drinking this for a good 3+ weeks. Aside from that, it doesn't smell or taste very good. Very herbal medicine-like."
3,Valerian Root Tea - What about the smell?,"I bought this product because I read that it was a very effective sleep aid. While it does help me sleep better, I wasn't warned about the smell of it. This tea has a very strong earthy odor and everyone around me complains of the stink when I drink it. I personally have a very poor sense of smell so I can tolerate it. I think this should be part of the product description."
5,Dandelion Root Tea is great!,"I was looking for a Dandelion Root tea that I could stand to drink sans cream or sugar without gagging. The Traditional Medicinals brand is way too strong tasting, but Alvita has a lovely mild taste, slight bitters but not disgusting. I recommend it if you are looking for a good dandelion root tea."
5,Fennel Seed Tea Bags,I do like herbal teas in general and this fennel seed tea has a very pleasant aroma and taste to it.
5,Excellent Tea,Excellent Tea. I enjoy a cup every now and then. It's really aromatic as well. Shipping was fast and hassle free.
2,Fenugreek tea,"The taste is not great, but it's bearable. I could not get used to the smell, the unfinished box is still sitting in my drawer and I've no plans to stock up in future."
3,Good herb,Very good herb for the woman's body especially if TTC. Also men can use this product too. But I would not recommend this brand. I really like the Traditional Medicinal brand instead.
2,Terrible shipper,This took way too long to get. It took weeks to finally arrive by mail. It would have been faster to walk there and get it.
5,Great surprise!,"I love ginger tea and add a ginger tea bag to whatever type of tea I'm drinking, like yerba mate, for instance. I was a bit hesitant to buy the combination peppermint and ginger (although I LOVE peppermint but usually in the context of dark chocolate and peppermint in mint patties or as stevia in coffee). I was happily surprised to love the combination! I also like the product because of the way it's packaged--doesn't waste paper by having each bag wrapped separately."
3,red clover,It was an interesting tasting tea. I would say that you would have to really like herbal teas. It definitely tasted like clover.
2,I liked it at first...,"The first box I ever bought was good. The tea, to me, tasted better cold than hot so I would make an ice tea of it and refrigerate it until I wanted it. The last few boxes I bought, however, were awful. I would boil the water and steep it and the tea would make this oily film over the top. It would just float and wasn't tasty to drink. I know sometimes plants have oils in them but this was excessive and killed the flavor. Not buying this brand again."
3,Alvita Tea,The Alvita tea is not very tasty. But it does pack a punch of benefits. It is priced well. Billberry is healthy for you. I gave it a 3 only because of taste.
5,Great quality Raspberry Leaf,"I trust Alvita's brand because all of the teas I have tried from them are pure and excellent quality. The Raspberry leaf is no exception. The taste is mild and it works like a charm to ease menstrual cramps. A must have during your moon cycle. Good value for the price.Also check outYogi Woman's Moon Cycle, Herbal Tea Supplement, 16-Count Tea Bags (Pack of 6)"
5,Fenugreek Seed Tea,"I bought this product because I read on a couple other sites that it can help with head and chest congestion. I also read it is safe to use while breastfeeding. So I tried it. If I drink it on an empty stomache it does seem to help with my cronic nasal congestion due to allergies. I saw no difference with chest congestion. I only drank the recommended 2 to 3 cups a day. Maybe I would see longer or more results at higher doses. I have noticed that I do smell alot like maple syrup even 4 days after not drinking the tea. I do mix it with Honey, if not it tastes awful to me. I never noticed a maple syrup smell on my 3 year old breastfeeding son like another site mentioned might happen. He does only nurse a few times a day now tho. Overall I like the product and will continue to use it when I am feeling congested. I even recommended it to somebody I know."
5,The best collection of short stories I've read this year,I really enjoyed this collection of short stories dedicated to dogs and murder. Most of the best dog mystery authors are included as well as contribution from such authors as Anne Perry and Dean James. A very enjoyable collection.
2,Dog Days of Short Story Writing,"Most of the short stories found within this compilation are clearly based on the authors' own lives. Thinly veiled plotlines with highly implausible and illogical points, all with dogs as the only common thread. I'm always willing to give authors a try, especially those I've never heard about prior to finding a book, but I believe there's a reason these are not on the best-seller lists."
5,Factual description of the POW experience.,"This book tells it like it was. Factual first-hand account of the many challenges faced by the brave men who were held as prisoners of war by the Japanese in the Phillipines. Moreover, it's a tribute to those who never returned. God bless brave men like Abie Abraham, for recording the truth for all time."
5,"Oh, God, Where Are You? Abie Abraham","Thank you Abie Abraham for writing the book. Thank you Abie Abraham for your efforts and dedication regarding the disinterring process. Not only does this book address those who suffered during WWII in the Philippines but this book also addresses Abie Abraham who went beyond himself. For me to imagine going through what Abie went through as a POW himself and then to further imagine a human being being able to disinter the so many bodies of those who died creates an image of a man, of an author, unselfish with his knowledge and with his time. I see a man, an author, who felt the pain, who saw the pain and the death of so many, and one who went on to tell the story. I met and had Abie Abraham sign my copy of Oh, God, Where Are You? I look forward to, now after reading the book, to meeting him again and having him resign my precious copy of Oh, God, Where Are You?"
1,EMPTY!!,Not sure if it's just me but I didn't realize that this item is just an empty bottle. I thought it would come filled with sealant. DUH on my part....
4,Sleeves are sleeves.,"These sleeves are nice, but no better than some alternative brands. They come nicely packaged and have a nice weight to them but there are similarly priced, more widely available alternatives (which have the same quality) that are available in many art supply and craft stores."
2,Not my style.,I thought it was a little to honkytonk-in. He has mellowed into a very good singer on his other albums
3,HEARTBREAKER,"LOOKING FOR THE OLD PRETENDERS, YOU WILL NOT FIND IT HERE. BEING A HUGE FAN I WAS DISAPPOINTED TO FIND THAT CHRISSIE HYDE IS GOING THROUGH A MID-AGE CRISSES AND DOSN'T REALIZE IT. MUSIC IS WHIMSICAL BUT REHASHED. LYRICS ARE SIMPLE AND MUNDANE. THE TITLE IS ""VIVA EL AMORE"",YET THROUGHOUT THE DISC SHE SINGS OF BETRAYAL AND LOVE LOST. SUGGEST PRETENDERS 1, 2, OR LEARNING TO CRAWL. DONT BUY THIS FOR JUST THE ""HUMAN"" SINGLE."
3,Nothing to write home about,"Yes, they're still around, and Chrissie's voice is still as distinctive as ever. The jewel case says that this features the hit ""Human."" I don't know if anyone else has heard it, but I never have. (Begs the question of what a hit really is?) Nails in the Road and One More Time are the best songs on the album."
3,One truly amazing moment,"Yeah, this is Chrissie's best since Learning to Crawl, but it's still no I or II for that matter. She's gone all safe on us singing ""she'll be buying herself a new pair of mitts"" in Popstar or ""well look what floats to the top"" in Nails in the Road. This kind of coyness from the woman who yowled ""But not me baby I'm too precious [you know the rest]? Still, Human is a great single. But the reson I'm even bothering you all today is to let you know that I haven't had the hair raised on the back ofmy neck in a long time, and Chrissie's astounding vocals One More Time did just that. Wow! I'll be breaking off the repeat button on my cd player with this one. Bravo!"
3,I wanted very much to like this....,"I have loved the Pretenders for almost twenty years, and was very excited to learn they had released a new album. Although I do think that musically, it is the strongest work from this band since Learning to Crawl, it still seems a bit formulaic. Chrissie Hynde is certainly one of rock's great voices, and that wonderful voice is featured to tremendous effect on a number of these songs. I really just wish she had put a bit more into the lyrics - her writing shows an inclination toward a certain easy sentimentality in the ballads, or a reliance on her 'tough-chick' persona in the uptempo songs (not to say that hers is not one of the coolest rock and roll 'attitudes' EVER). Nonetheless, Chrissie is the greatest, and any album of her work and voice is certain to contain its share of pleasures."
5,ABSOLUTELY THE BEST!,"A FRIEND OF MINE SUGGESTED THIS CD TWO MONTHS AGO. I HAVE LISTENED TO IT EVERY DAY SINCE!! HUMAN HAS GOT TO BE ONE OF THE BEST SONGS EVER! IT WAS HARD TO GET PAST TRACK 2 BUT ONCE BEYOND, IT ONLY GETS BETTER!! THID CD SHOULD BE A PART OF EVERYONE'S COLLECTION!"
2,"Good concept, but lacks a glossary","This book has a solid approach of linking grammar topics with communication functions. The book does a good job of showing the particular real-life contexts in which the various structures can be used. In addition, the explanations are straightforward, non-technical, and clear.The fatal flaw, however, is that the book lacks both vocabulary lists in the units and a glossary at the end of the book. I think that this book might still be useful as a supplementary resource, but it can definitely not serve as a primary self-instructional course."
1,can;t listen,i would like to listen to it to see if this is really what i amlooking for without doing this first i have no idea if it is the right thing.robin
4,Powerhouse pc needed+a good game,This is the first game I've played that advertises for a pc compent. You need a powerhouse pc to play it. It is cool. Very advanced with a few bugs. Toa look realstic. Good.
2,"Product good, delivery service HORRIBLE","The product is alright, but they delivered it late and then on top of that delivered the wrong bed frame."
2,Very Hard Game,"This game is not for kids, I played it before I gave it to my kids. Things move to slow and the controls are a pain in the ---."
1,"delayed,delayed,delayed...cancelled... bad business practice",I ordered this on 10/15/2006 in Amazon.My order has been delayed 4 timesand when I called Amazon customer service ...they said sorry for delay and I will get it in Feb 2007(4months). It seems like they will just keep delay it until I cancel the order. Again I got mail from Amzaon saying that they cancelled my order in Dec.They said its not available. But I got to say that I'm very dissappointed on how Amazon handled this.It is redicculous...if it is not available..they should have notified me before...I wasted my time...and I never got this item.
1,VERY Disapointed,My daughter bought this toy with her own money and was very excited to play with it until we got it out of the box and TRIED to put it together. The slide does not stay together and is not made in the correct size. When attached at the top and bottom to keep in place it comes apart in the middle. Not sure that Mattel checked this out before putting it on the market. We contacted Mattel and they would just say they were sorry and would give me my money back but that doesn't do anything for my very sad 4 year old who cannot play with the toy she purchsed with her own money. I would not buy this item and ours is going back to the store. If the slide was the right size it would be a great toy. She had fun playing with it but was very upset everytime she had Polly slide down the slide and it fell apart.
2,did not hold up good,It was fun for a while. After I used it a while some of the water spouts don't work any more. It was very fun while it worked. Overall I would not recomend it.
4,Love it!,"My daughter got this for her 4th birthday and she loved it! This was her 1st Polly Pocket toy and now she is hooked! Sure it can be a bit messy but it's water...very harmless!The only thing I didn't like was that the items you can buy to hook onto the side, don't stay hooked on very well...which is frustrating to a 4 year old.All together...great toy!"
4,Polly Mini water PaRk,"Hi ppl. I got this toy for Christmas. The polly Doesnt have much room 2 swim, or even sit, 4 that matter, but its pretty fun. I have all 3 sets now, but i dont like way the big the big slide on the main det (this 1)is right over the slide on the 1 with Chrissy, it kinda gets in the way. Thx 4 reading this,Darcy, age 11"
1,Very Dissapointed!!!!,"My daughter got this for easter not even 1 week ago and we both find this toy very poorly made. She loves polly pocket, but gets frustrated with this toy for several reasons. For one, the slide comes apart everytime she tries to slide down her polly pocket dolls. Reason two, the waterfountain only worked for two days.Now only two holes where the water comes out, works. Not durable at all. And the last reason is the water does not trickel out, it pours out and gets water all over the place. I would not recomend this toy to any young child."
2,Broke in Two Days,"My 6 year old daughter received this for her birthday. Within two days of opening it one of the water outlets stopped working. The water slide would not stay in place and water goes everywhere even when filled as directed. The water everywhere is managable (we put towels under it) however, there is not a lot of ""play value"" for the mess."
4,Good toy with hours of playtime fun.,"My 6 year old daughter bought this toy with her own money and she has had it for two weeks. She loves it and wants to play with it as soon as she comes home from school. I plan to buy the other compatible sets for her birthday coming up. I find that the slide stays together well, but even if it does come apart, she can put it back together herself and does so without complaint. No, there is not much room to swim, but the waterfall is really cool, especially with the multi-colored lights. Once the water button is pushed, the water comes out for about 10 minutes, then shuts off automatically. This Polly's hair is really pretty with the glittery strands and for being wet numerous times, it still looks good as new and it seems to be holding up well. We have some Polly dolls with rats nests for hair. All in all, I think it was a great value for the money."
3,Fun in the Sun,I bought this today for my daughter and she hasn't stop playing with it when we open it. She got a kick out of it just playing her doll and the dolphin under the water. It does splash a little bit so I put a hand towel under it but otherwise I think this is a cool toy for girls to play.Chantal and Caitlyn
5,Loves it.,"Highly recommend this well written hillarious tale of Richard, the ""rubber room resident"". This is a great read for anyone and would make an awesome gift this holiday season."
5,Excellent Reading!,I love this book! I couldn't wait to find out what happened next. It really kept my interest. I recommend this book to all types of readers. I hope there will be a sequel. I give this book a big thumbs up!
2,Not like the hospital - at least not mine,"These are not like the disposable dry wipes supplied at my hospital. They are much rougher - not soft and clothlike at all. Much more like a thick, sturdy paper towel.The closest I've found to the soft dry wipes supplied at hospitals is a disposable washcloth from Babies R Us."
2,Lots of talk. Few goals.,"The main feature is essentially a one hour interview with Steven Gerrard, other Liverpool players, and sports journalists. The interviews have little substance beyond ""Gerrard is great!"". The interviews are interspersed with a handful of his best goals. The few that are shown are repeated a great many times. There is a bonus feature which shows all 100 goals in chronological order. The bonus feature, however, has no narration, no setup of the goals, and no commentary. It is just a rapid fire showing of the goals. The goals themselves are beautiful but the DVD actually detracts from the experience rather than adding to it. I bought this for my young son who is a Liverpool fan. Gerrard is his favorite player in the world. He found the DVD boring."
4,Great Collection,"Good collection - not outstanding except for the track ""Leave Me"" which is brill. Good background music."
3,Works well but strap is too big,"I used to have a Polar heart monitor but lost the watch. I decided to go with this model because it's less expensive. I have an average women's size body and the adjustable strap that goes around your chest is too big for me. Since the smallest that the strap adjusts to is too big, I have it adjusted with a bunch of the strap material flopping around on my back (I didn't have this problem with Polar). It's annoying and will require a sewing experiment some time soon. The heart monitor part works well though. Mine came with a neato bag and bike or exercise equipment holder for the transmitter (watch)."
5,this product works beautifully,"You know when you are on a treadmill or bike that has a pulse sensor? You have to grab onto the sensors the whole time to monitor your pulse rate. I had this on while I was on the Polar treadmill at my gym and while wiping my forehead I realized that I did not lose the heartrate when I took my hands from the handles. It turns out that the treadmill picks up the signal from the transmitter you wear around your chest and accurately displays the results on the screen. It was like freedom. I could run in a normal fashion, not holding onto those bars. I also didn't need to wear the watch while on the treadmill, which was nice while in the gym. It works very well outside as well using the alarm to keep your target heartrate in check. The only problem I had was that the battery it came with died after 2 months and wasn't that easy to change. I think it may have been on a shelf for a year or more."
4,Great Value,"Great heart monitor for the price. There are fancier monitors out there, but you might have to pay 5 times as much. For a basic monitor, this product works great. Very reliable so far."
5,Works Great,"I was really pleased with this product, as I began to warm up the monitor after 5 min start calculting my heart rate..it was pretty cool. the chest strap is very comfortable, you dont even have to where it?..as long as it is a certain distance from you, it still picked up my heart rate!..I simply had it laying on the treadmill panel....for the price, I did well!"
2,Too much hand-wringing,"This book reads like a lot of histerical hand-wringing. It makes the point that things are going toward the bottom, over and over.Whats missing is that the writer offers no concrete solutions."
5,Very Rare Footage,I've been collection miliary footage from World War II for quite some time now and this is one of the most interesting disks I've bought in a while.The film quality is watchable - but far from perfect - but these particular shots of actual World War II combat are ones that I have not been able to find anywhere else.The commentary is kept to a bare minimum and the footage is very dramatic.In a way I'm sorta glad they did not use artificial methods to restore the footage because it comes off as more real this way.
5,Nothing But Hits!,"It is rare that one listens to a complete CD, but this is an album that keeps the listeners' interest from start to finish. There are 9 hits on here (out of 11 tracks)--Hail Mary, Genuine, Bone Daddy, Midnight Rose, You're All I Need, I Get the Picture, MyMy, Sin City and the last & best song, In This World. This is an album anyone can relate to in any era, any age group. Soulful lyrics, excellent vocals, no gratuitous guitar solos, some of the best drumming and singing of his career by Corky Laing and a beautifully produced album. Laing & Schenkman will be THE writing team of the next decade if they can duplicate or improve on this great debut CD."
2,Marred and mired---maybe next time,"The combination of Eric Schenkman on guitars (Spin Doctors), Corky Laing on drums, and a dose of the late Noel Redding playing bass on a number of tracks seems promising on paper. But ""Speed of Thought"" is a very mixed bag despite the talent on board for this recording.Mostly loud and technically very good, the music sounds strained and forced at times, making it hard to stick with more than a track or two. And after a couple of listens, one tends to note the better tracks----Bone Daddy and Get the Picture, for instance----and forgoes most of the others. Still. Mr. Schenkman and Mr. Laing can both play and sing with abandon.The lyrics sometimes seem too much of the same thing and tend to celebrate or denigrate the excesses of rock-star life, and providing little for the ordinary listener to celebrate. Perhaps a follow-up recording will prove more accessible and more convincing. Still, if you can pick up a copy for $2, you might want to hear for yourself."
4,Plastic Bag Dispenser,Nice item. It came with all of the screws necessary to attach this to the inside of my pantry. This handy dispenser holds a lot of bags in one place but shipping is ridiculous.
4,Very handy,"Works great. No problems whatsoever. I expected just a little bigger, but that's my fault for not reading the dimensions."
4,Works Well - Fits the Space I Have,"The dispenser is larger than it looked in the picture, but fit well under the sink.The only downside is that some of the edges are sharper than I like."
5,Great product.,"I give this product a five for functionality, easy of installation, and a neatness function in my pantry. Cost was minimal."
4,quality cooking,"This stir fry (wok) is worth the bucks. It heats evenly & quickly even though a small surface area is in contact with the element, and cleans up well even when you forget to do the dishes until the next day. If you enjoy stir fry at all, this is the stovetop solution. We've had ours for a year, and it shows NO wear."
4,"Buy this instead of those ""professional"" cookware","This stir fry pan is better than most. I like it because it is lighter than most. Handle is easy to grip and it comes with a cover which is a good one. It also last longer than most.Enough praises. But I have to tell you that if you use it regularly, it won't last over a year. ""Stir Fry"" requires high heat and ""Nonstick"" requires medium heat. ""Nonstick Stir Fry"" means ""good pan for a year"". I use it 5 times a week and trust me, it will start sticking within a year no matter what utensils you use and how careful you clean it.Having said that, this stir fry pan is still a good value. Especially the standard size cover which will out last the pan. Do not waste money on those ""professional"" cookwares that cost over $100. Buy 2 of this instead. The only difference is the professional is heavier and had a thicker Teflon coating."
5,Love this wok!,"I bought one and liked it so much, I turned around and bought a second so I can stir fry two batches at once. I have cooked in them several times a week for several years and they are still in perfect condition. I love the flat bottom and also fry and saute in these pots. It's great to have the clear lid. I use Chinese wooden spoons for stir-frying and they fit the slope of the pot perfectly and never scratch."
4,A Pan I Use All the Time,"Although called a stir-fry pan by the manufacturer, this is actually a good general-use pan for tasks like making risotto and cooking various sauces, in addition to stir-frying. The bottom may be a little flat for stir-frying purists, but this what makes the pan good for other tasks. I already had a pan like this one that was about four years old and going strong, when the glass top slipped and shattered on our tiled kitchen floor. The top is an important part of the pan for some uses, so I had to order a new one.I use this pan nearly every evening for cooking something. It heats evenly, retains heat well, and is very good value for the cost. The only reason it got four stars instead of five is its size--it is a bit large for an ordinary stove like ours--but its versatility makes up for this one problem."
3,COULD HAVE BEEN BETTER,"Not as good as the other Barb Wire poster I ordered . It could have been better , I rate it as only so-so"
2,Out of Date,"This book discusses the basics of flight. If you already know how to fly, but are trying to transition to Ultralights, this book is definitely not for you. You will be wasting your money. If you've never flown, this book is very dated. There are far more current books on the market that discuss the characteristics of Ultralights and have taken into account advancements in the industry and material over the past 15 years."
2,A Disappointment,"I didn't care for this book. It was only a discussion about how bio identical hormones can create or maintain health, according to the author and her experiences. It wasn't broad enough or particularly compelling, to me."
5,Greatest Album nobody ever heard of....,There are at least 6 great songs on this album besides The Rose. It's amazing Amanda is so overlooked!
4,"Pretty good stuff, but be gentle with it","I got this set of cookware in January and have really liked it. It cooks well and the non-stick surface is nice. But... be very careful with the utensils that you use. For example, even a PLASTIC spatula can scratch if the plastic edge is hard and not smooth. I use rubber spatulas from Le Creuset (and no -- I don't work for them! ). So, with gentle care, I believe this cookware will last you a long time."
5,Still great after nine years...,"... I realize that you're not supposed to put these pots in the dishwasher. Oops! We got this set as a wedding gift nine years ago and use various items on an almost daily basis. ...And put them in the dishwasher. They don't quite look like new, but they do work just as well as they did on day one. We have a high-end gas cooktop, which pumps out a lot of heat, and my cooking style involves high heat, dry-frying, flambe, and all manner of mistreatment. I exepected the Anolon set to last a little longer than cheaper alternatives, but I am amazed at the longevity of these great products. The only drawback is I have no excuse to buy new stuff!"
5,I love it,"I love this set. The nonstick surface works very well, and is easy to clean. The see-thru lids are nice, and the work well on the saute pans and skillets as well (even though they aren't pictured that way). The lids make great splatter screens. The quality is very good. These items were on our wedding registry. What a great, lasting item."
2,"Compagnia Dell'Arabica ""Brazil Santos"" 54 Espresso Pods",For me they are kind of weak not exactly what I was hoping for but if you're looking for simpicity then you will like this product.
4,Beware of What You Order...,"Another tale of deadly insects in the Bug Files series. An excavation unearths some strange clusters that turn out to be eggs that can still hatch if water is added. An unscrupulous businessman sells the eggs through mail order ads in comic books.The eggs hatch into horrible ants that will eat just about anything (including you and me). The ants are ancient in origin. Although they are a natural species, they used to have natural predators that kept then under control. The voracious ants whose natural predators are now extinct quickly spread to become a world-wide problem.A wonderfully fun horror story. I have enjoyed the entire Bug Files series."
4,Barnyard Gone Wrong? CD Gone RIGHT!,"Yes, essentially a less-silly, less-calypso, more-psychedelic Leftover Salmon, or Newgrass Revival. I've seen Blueground Undergrass half a dozen times here in Atlanta where they hail from, and have interviewed Jeff Mosier for my magazine and Web site. Yes, they are 10 times better live, but as a nice, clean studio souvenir of their stuff, this CD is good. They have another CD under a different name, Good Medicine, called ""Prompt, Temporary Relief."" This CD features a more traditional bluegrass style, and is actually even better than ""Barnyard Gone Wrong."" Get `em both or you're missing out!"
4,Rockin' Roots at its best,"BGUG has taken the mainstays of American music masters, acknowledged their influence, then gone off with their music as if it was brand new! The Father of Bluegrass Music, Mr. Bill Monroe, would want to play along on their ""Wheel Hoss"", Dr. Ralph Stanley would appreciate their ""Oh, Death"", and Mr. Dylan would surely be pleased with their ""Times They Are A'Changin'""! Yet this highly skilled group of instrumentalists manages to take you through many dimensions in the course of serving up some old fashioned good sounding, yet rockin', psychin', flyin' music! This recording of ""Orange Blossom Spatial"" could become the new yardstick. This is music for real people. Highly recommend this CD, and suggest if you're looking for music which will stir your blood, buy it, and, I agree, don't pass up one of their live performances!"
4,Another gem from Glenn,"This latest CD covers all the genres Glenn is known for, it should please his funk fans and his hard rock fans too, Glenn has said that he will be concentrating on hard rock only with CD releases in his name but this CD has some good funky bass lines and rocks out good, if your a fan of Glenn Hughes you probably already have bought but if your new to Glenn this is a good place to start."
4,Nice Little Unit,"I was unexpectedly surprised to see how easy it was to set up this temperature indicator. We have it sitting on a shelf and it's fairly attractive. It reads out to a tenth of a degree F., which is kind of strange since the specs only guarantee accuracy to within +/- one degree F. But, it still gives you a good idea of conditions outside. The mounting of the sensor using the screws provided is a bit tough. Be sure to pre drill holes because the philips head will deform and be useless if you try torquing without drilling first. I gave up on the screws and used the pressure sensitive adhesive pad included."
2,A TOY!!! Roll-the dice -or- save your money!,These are highly inaccurate! A $1.00 thermometer will give you better results. Placing both indoor transmitter and outdoor in the same room can show degree variances of 4-degrees! WOW! This is terrible for a digital thermometer. The game they play is to suggest that their units have a RESOLUTION of .1 degree; but hide that the ACCURACY is as high as 2-degrees (a whopping 20-times different from the unit's RESOLUTION!!!) Therefore two units (eg. indoor & outdoor) can show differences of 4-degrees!
1,peice of junk,"This unit will be lucky to be within 15 deg. of actual out side temp. After several weeks of conversing the company sent me a different ""sending unit"" which turned out to be no more accurate than the original unit. I would not recommend this unit to anyone."
2,you get what you pay for,"I bought a WS-7013BZ to replace an old Radio Shack wired indoor/outdoor digital that I'd had for many years. I wanted to place the unit in a different room and wanted to lose the wire as well. If you need temps accurate to .1 degrees (why?) you'll probably want to try spending more on your weather instrument than you do for a case of beer. I have found the range of the unit to be disappointing. Both my receivers are on inside window sills less than 15 feet from the sensor and one room loses contact with the transmitter regularly, causing inaccurate or blank outdoor temp readings."
1,Pay attention to the SMALL print,"In very small print on the product description it says 4"" x 2"" actual size(since sending Amazon a complaint and returning the item, I notice that the description has been updated to include this at a larger font). Overall, gives you outside and inside temperature and saves highest and lowest temps, but unit is VERY SMALL in size. Pass on this one."
3,It's okay --,"I bought this for my elderly father so that he would be able to keep track of the temperature inside the house as well as outside -- and it does. I probably wouldn't buy this unit again though. The digital display is difficult to read - contrast is poor. Also, the remote temperature sensors have a very low range - they won't work if you're more than 20' away."
4,La Crosse Technology WS-7013BZ Wireless Temperature Station,I bought this item becasue the remote sensor to my old unit died. That was my fault because I let water get into the unit and sit.The old sender was at least 4 years old and was working till I killed it.I wanted to replace the sensor and a replacement was almost the price of another system.So now I have two receivers and one sensor both units work with the same sensor. My only disappointment is that the new desk top receiver is somewhat smaller than the older unit but works well.Both units are only about 25ft or so from the remote sender and have not lost the signal yet. My older unit did sometimes loose the signal when it was further away 50ft.Than you would have to pull the battries and reinstall to reconnect the link and reset all setting such as time ect which is kind of a pain.Have to say for the price and the fact I got an extra receiver now vs just a new sender not a bad deal all in all.
2,Remote Sensor Died A Quick Death,"As the title says, the remote sensor died a quick death so I got a replacement unit. The remote sensor died on that one pretty quickly as well.I know that sometimes things go wrong with good products, but two sensors dying so quickly apparently was not a fluke. This is a cheaply made piece of equipment, so I guess you get what you pay for.I gave a friend an Oregon Scientific unit three years ago and it is still going strong, so I'd advise you to stay away from La Crosse and go with Oregon Scientific."
4,La Crosse Technology WS-7013BZ Wireless Temperature Station,Nice little weather station with very accurate readings at a very inexpensive price through Amazon. Several give temperatures on a sunny deck or a shady porch - both on each station.
4,Great and easy to setup!,"This is a great product! Easy to setup and it works perfectly for what we wanted, reading the temperature inside and at 2 locations outside our house with a sun porch."
2,"Poor Battery Life, get other model","We have the La Crosse Technology WS-7014CH-IT Wireless Weather Station in one room, and this receiver in another. This model stops receiving the outdoor temperature due to low batteries every two months like clockwork (and is actually closer to the transmitter). The WS-7014CH-IT batteries last about a year. All using Energizer or Duracell batteries. You will spend enough money on batteries to pay for the other model, never mind the frustration of it never showing the outside temperature. I am here today buying another 7014 so I can throw this one out."
3,Lite in August,"A brilliantly written, beautifully evocative story that tries much too hard to be profound. The author has a lived-in knowledge of human nature as well as descriptive genuis...but his pretentious tone and feeble epiphanies weigh the story down. The title is very apt: the atmosphere of the book bogs down into a fancy Gothicism that seems largely decorative. The emotions of the story remain mild and vaporous. A frustrating waste of the author's gifts."
2,Potential lost,"A mess of a tale jumps all over the place, leaves the reader breathless with frustration....even at the end the reader wonders, ""What the heck?"" A waste of time and a long way to go for a big reveal of a mystery still unsolved. Did she leave or was she killed and who killed her? Too confusing and unpleasurable to read to be enjoyable."
5,Decorations in a Ruined Cemetary,The book came very quickly and in perfect condition. I also loved the book.
4,great deal on this one,"i'm very happy with the dean playmate,it was a great deal,great price,and fast free shipping.go amazon!!!!! and plays nice ,with good sound,"
2,Approach with Caution,"Poorly Written, January 25, 2006Being a ""doctor"" does not necessarily make one a good writer, which is the case here. The subject matter is intriguing for sure, but the author here does nothing to elevate the subject matter beyond what is already quite well-known. What is surprising and a little unsettling however, in regards to having this written by a ""doctor"" is the continued use of expressions like ""she wasn't quite right in the head"" and the complete lack of medical insight, and more importantly, respect. There is also a general disrespect for women-- or rather ""girls""-- as the author prefers to call them. Some of the facts are completely incorrect, and one wonders who the fact checkers and editors on this project are. The psychiatric and medical credibility of the author is nill, as well as the ability to write well. It is up for debate within which of these two trades he is most lacking in skill, ability, talent or integrity."
4,Couldn't put it down!,"If you have trouble thinking on your own or don't like to push your brain to the limit, I would definitely stay away from Cox's second book. While I won't give it away, the ending will leave you coming back for more. This is a great second novel from a young, up and coming writer. The research that went into the book is phenomenal; Cox most certainly put his heart and soul into his second thriller. At the same time, his writing style makes it so that even if you aren't a world renowned physicist, you can understand what is happening. If you like science and physics this is the book for you, and there is even some love plot twisted through the pages. All in all, great novel, great writer, and I am looking forward to more from Cox."
2,No Content,"This SF novel starts out with an interesting pair of plot lines: A man falls from a window and yet is somehow alive. A scientist in Texas is looking for Higgs particles.Then the novel gets bogged down in nave theological dialog and (I'm being nitpicky here) biblical errors.However, the sex scenes and disrespect of marriage were the last straw. I put this down after reading two-thirds. It showed no promise at all."
4,Entertaining Possibilities,"Richard Cox has written an exciting work of fiction melding the diverse perspectives of his characters, quantum physics, religion, romance, and conspiracy theory into an accelerating read.The science is woven into the book in a way that appeals to both science minded non-fiction readers and those who enjoy the fantasy of fiction.His characters are human, rich, and vivid allowing empathy for even the ones I loved to hate. I enjoyed the conversations of science and religion and found them to be as engaging as the plot itself. The last half of the book really speeds up, keeping the reader pushing towards the end to reveal the answers.The God Particle is a book about seeking answers. If you spend time pondering the deep questions, I recommend giving the God Particle a read. Also pick upRiftby Richard Cox. You'll dig it."
5,The Best of Joe Cocker: Live from Dortmond,This is the video I viewed on You Tube until it was blocked by the owners therefore was glad to find almost the same copy on your website. Thanks.
1,very poor image quality,I loved the venue. It is very unfortunate that the video image quality is so poor. It makes you wonder if Mr. Cocker is aware of just how bad it is. Artists like him deserve the best when it comes producing a DVD. The business responsible for this product should be exposed and driven out of business. I advise to look for another concert of his on DVD. What a bummer...
2,Bad quality,"Image on this dvd is very bad (even with upscaling), sound quality isn't good either. Its really sad that there's no blu-ray concert available."
3,kids boxing gloves,The gloves seem to be a little too hard for my boys ages 3 and 7 therefore they dont play with them that often.
1,Item did not survive shipment -- twice,"BEWARE OF THIS ONE! I saw this item in a local store for its list price of $249, so I jumped at the chance to get it much cheaper on Amazon with free shipping and no sales tax. Unfortunately, the item I received from Amazon's NJ warehouse had holes punched in the box, the packing slip was ripped off and missing, and the interior styrofoam packing was shattered to bits. The copper pit itself was dented so badly that it almost had a hole in the middle. I called Amazon, and they sent a replacement which just arrived, but I (wisely) stopped the UPS truck before he could leave the box and drive away. The replacement was the same -- holes punched in the box, with interior packing destroyed. I refused acceptance of the delivery of this replacement pit. Additionally, it's worth it to point out that both boxes had after-factory clear packing tape around the edges, so I suspect I was sent returned items. I like the item, but have no choice but to purchase one locally."
5,This is What Rock is All About!,"I remember when this one came out, I played the ""Hades"" out of it. This is one of the best albums of the 80's, a perfect blend of rock and rhythm and blues. Hall's voice has never been stronger, and Oates guitar riffs are superb. ""Method of Modern Love"" had me rocking as I went to work; ""Out of Touch"" had me ""thumping"" after I got there; and ""Going Thru the Motions"" brought me home. The party didn't stop then because the entire album took me through the wee hours of the morning. The new ""boy bands"" have nothing on this soulful duo. Hall & Oates were, and will forever be, the greatest pair in the rock and roll era!"
5,Greatest Hits Volume 2?,"This is a great album. I have this album on record, cassette, and CD. Record first, then the cassette, this has an extra version of Out Of Touch, an extended remix, and of course CD to replace the record. All the songs on this album are great. Possession Obsession and Some Things Are better Left Unsaid are my favorites. This is a must for any Hall & Oates fan."
4,Take Me Back to 1984!,"OK, so there are the usual couple of throwaway songs here (I won't even bother naming them). ""Out of Touch"" and ""Method of Modern Love"" virtually sparkle even 16 years after their release. And anyone who thinks of John Oates as the Andrew Ridgeley of this duo needs to take a listen to ""Possession Obsession"", which should have gotten a lot more airplay than it did. Yes, this album retains a very 80's sound, but what's wrong with that? Go get this one!"
4,All American Rock,"Don't let that ""blue-eyed soul"" label that so many misguided people like to label these guys, this album rocks from start to finish. ""Big Bam Boom"" remains one of the gems of the 80's with former number one song ""Out of Touch"" and other hits like ""Method of Modern Love"", ""Some Things Are Better Left Unsaid"" and ""Possession Obsession"" (All of which are available as 12"" remixes except ""Some Things..."" that 12"" is NOT a remix...). ""Going Through The Motions"", ""All American Girl"" and ""Bank On Your Love"" really rock this baby out."
4,ONE OF THERE BEST CD'S,"VOCAL ARRANGEMENTS COULD NOT BE ANY BETTER ON THIS DUO PERFORMANCE, ESPECIALLY JOHN OATES. POSSESION OBSESSION, COLD DARK AND YESTERDAY, AND ALL AMERICAN GIRL ARE SOME OF THE UNDERRATED CUTS.THIS WAS VINTAGE HALL& OATES AT THERE BEST."
4,Silver Bullets,"In Florida's overcrowded and painfully competitive municipal marketplace, I need all the silver bullets I can get to support my cause for applying the BEST technology FIRST for EVERY flow measurement application. The Consumer Guide to Magnetic Flowmeters has become my new best friend. I regularly use this guide as an independant resource to support my electromagnetic flowmeter sales efforts. Our technically savy customers know that most manufacturer's literature are written to ""sell"" product. The CGMF offers end users an unbiased view of Mag's and identifies instrument strengths and short-comings. Two thumbs up from Florida!JEFF SMITH - ALPHA VALVE & CONTROLS, INC."
4,Multi0cooker,"This product is one of the best cooking appliances around! I have made many dinners in the crock-pot, and I steam and deep fry in it as well. For under $30, and how little space it uses compared to buying both a deep fryer and a crock pot, it is more than worth the money. As a matter of fact, it should be more, so I received a bargain! This is only my second multi-cooker in almost 15 years. You can't beat it."
4,Very Good Product!,"This was an intelligent purchase. It is almost a joy to use!Excellent price even with shipping. I paid $50 for it, and then taxes. The crockery makes it function like a true slow cooker."
5,Straight Classic!!,Straight Classic!!for all the real hip hop underground head of the nineezyou know what kind of album this is ... Straight Classic!!
3,A lesson to learn by imitating!,"I really enjoyed reading this story to my students and working with activities that went along with the book. For example miming the action words in the book, drawing, and writing a book report. This is wonderful story about a chick and a duck who hatch at the same time and become friends. The chick imitates the duck until the duck goes for a swim. However, the chick attempts to swim, but can't and is rescued by the duck. The Chick realizes that it is ok not to do everything the duck does. The duck can go for a swim with out him. The moral of the story, sometimes it is perfectly ok to imitate, but at other times be yourself, do your own things and have your own ideas."
2,Illustrator,"One point I would like to make for international readers: I don't understand what sense it makes to publish Suteyev's books w/o his marvelous illustrations. If you love beautifully illustrated children books, do yourself a favor and get some of his many works even w/o English translation. The illustrations themselves are well worth the money."
3,I love to plan my son's birthday with creative books,"This book lacked things like putting the page number so can quickly find the party theme. So you page through until you find it. Once I got there it had the basic things you or I would come up with. Then they go on to says invitations, decorations, games, activities, food and favors but again then you have to search in other places to find each topic. No pictures!However once you get to Invites there are 8 different ideas. Same goes for decorations, games, activities, food and favors.Within each section there are some really cute ideas, recipes on how-to.Over all the book is helpful and cute ideas and themes, just not put together well."
5,"If you need one of these, this is a good one.","The cable appears to be sturdy, and it works. There really isn't much more that can reasonably be said about it.Perfection is sometimes boring."
1,Worthless!,"You literally have to keep jiggling the female end to get sound from both R and L channel. I've tried multiple pairs of headphones, with the same result. I sometimes can get it to work by twisting things a certain way, etc, but nothing reliable for more than a minute or two."
1,"Not recreation, religion","I expected bio-feedback, and that the game should be a bit New Age. But, this is a game of multiple deities, to become one of the `blue people' was not what I wanted. I have played most of the passage and technically the game works. There is no health emphasis, no graduated relaxation or heart rate counters. Rather, you become proficient at controlled relaxation in order to meet a contrived deity, then you are indoctrinated while in a state of hypnosis. I wanted an entertaining way to relax, not to become quasi Hindu."
5,"Tristan, child of sadness","I wish all books were like this -- action-packed, romantic, and deeply moving. This story captures the love, the passion, the anguish, the pain. Some major events are told in a single paragraph. It's brilliant. I loved it. I will keep this one, and read it again."
3,A Keeper,"I had to read this for a history class and thought I woult dread it, but it is a very nice love story - way better than Romeo and Juliet, and did reflect the changing view of romantic love in literature of the time. I will be keeping it in my library instead of selling it back to the bookstore - and that says a lot!"
3,Excellent romance novel of medieval France,"Although this novel is light in nature for the most part, there are times when the forever human struggle of Love will move the reader deeper and deeper into the story. The reader should find themselves rooting for the doomed loves, Tristan and Isluet, throughout the adventure. At times there are tremoundous action scenes, with a well written interactions between the two lovers at the heart of the story. If you love someone deeply, you should enjoy this boook."
5,Midsomer Murders Set 17,Another Inspector Barnaby must & one of my favourite crime series. Superb acting lovely English villages & countryside. Highly recommend.
5,"Midsomer Murders, Set 17 from Amazon","This is a great series, and I'm close to completing my set. Amazon is very helpful if one disc doesn't work properly. The set is replaced promptly and with courtesy. I had no trouble at all with most of the sets, including Set 17."
5,Excellent viewing,This Midsomer Murders: set 17 is the latest in the series. I have collected all to date and will continue to collect them for as long as the series is around. The stories are well planned. The scenery is spectacular and the acting is above reproach. A great series that any murder mystery buff will enjoy.
3,"Enjoyable, BUT...","This is definitely an enjoyable series with great writing and good performances. However, I'd like to point out a few things on the down side; 1- the murders are extremely grizzly with lots of blood and mutilated corpses at every episode, which is in sharp contrast to the supposedly peaceful villages where they occurred. 2 - The motives that caused the villagers to murder are very trivial and petty most of the time. 3 - The murderers are the most unlikely people; people who have lived clean and decent lives in a nice peaceful village suddenly go berserk for some petty reason and start butchering their neighbors.So obviously the writers achieve their goal - it's just about impossible to guess who done it, but it made me feel let down in the end of every episode.Anyway, like I said - it is an enjoyable show never the less, just take off your thinking cap and enjoy the blood fest..."
4,great,what can i say...the midsomer series is excellent and well written. i cannot wait for the next installment. i luv this set.
5,"England's Other Treacherous Universe, Minus Doctor Who's Blue Box","This an excellent series, with a healthy tongue-in-cheek attitude about itself as the most dangerous bucolic region of rustic England, especially Badger's Drift. What fun to read the cast interviews - Nettles as a wicked sense of humor. The filming is of course a treat, but so are the stories, absurd as they are at times. ""Midsomer Murders"" often deftly explore not only British history, but the class-system. In ""The Dogleg Murders"" bribery and caste meet, i.e. my kingdom for a golf course membership. In ""The Black Book,"" painted poser pigs reveal fraudulent art. In ""Secrets and Spies,"" Barnaby is revealed as a former MI5 operative. ""The Glitch"" entertains with more class issues and business dealings, with cyclists enjoying the lovely countryside. You simply can't go wrong with any of the Midsomer series. Enjoy!"
1,It's a Hypnosis Video,"Didn't actually watch the tape because you can't return opened VHS tapes. This self-help video offers ""Video Hypnosis"" for reprogramming yourself. Not what I expected or wanted"
2,Basic common sense! Don't waste your money.,"The book was good, but for the price I was disappointed. You are your baby's first ""entertainment system"" with silly faces and songs. For $20 this book basically gives you ideas that you can easily find for free on the internet and in less costly books! Don't waste your money; there are less expensive books on the market with the same information."
5,Your baby will love it!,"Thank you Ms. Stelfox for creating this book! I hung ""Baby Be Loved"" next to the changing table when my baby girl was just a week or two old. When she was fussy she'd look up at it and she would quiet right down, it was amazing! She was fascinated with the black and white (and later color) illustrations that really drew her attention. I take ""Baby Be Loved"" along on car trips too. I never leave home without it! I would strongly recommend this book to all new parents. It makes a terrific shower gift too. What a wonderful way to share in your child's early development!"
5,Now what??,"When I brought my first baby home from the hospital, I looked at him and thought, ""OK, now what do I do with him?"" This book gives you a little something to focus on each day, either a song to sing, an exercise, a game, or other suggestions to entertain and stimulate your baby. It's like a friend giving you a good piece of advice every day! You and your baby will love it!"
5,This book rocks,This book is the best. It has so much stuff that any charmed fan would love. All you people that thought the book was bad need to shut up. It is a great book. I don't know what you thought was wrong with it. Just because it doesn't give information on season 6 doesn't mean it isn't a great book. It has more charmed info than any other book. So if you didn't like it tough maybe you should get a life. Anyway if you are a charmed fan I would definately recommend this book to you. It has so much great stuff. It definatly deserves 5 stars.
3,A fan of Charmed,"I like this book, but where are the bloopers and did you know from the book of shadows. Please whoever wrote the book continue with the seasons, because in this book it ends right after Chris comes in the fifth? season primiere. Also please keep Drew Fuller as older Chris in the series. He's a great actor. And if someone who does the show reads this, please continue with the show and please tell us when the next season is going to come on."
5,Wonderful !!!,"Well, I have spent a really long time waiting for a book of Charmed like this !!! It's a treasure, a Bible of every kind of informations we could expect for about the show : the démons, all the spells until the 5'th saison, interviews... and several things moreover. Besides, it's a very confortable book to read since there is a great distribution of all the chapters. for the fans of the show, you should buy this book!! I swear you won't be dissapointed!!!Charmed forever in our heart"
3,book of rubbish,i'm in the process of reading this book and so far it's not very good at least at quarter of the book is an episode guide (which you can easily find on the net) there are very few color pictures and the cast interviews are quiet short so if you wanted more of a look at the cast this isn't the book for you. if your intrested in the wiccan side this still isn't the book for you because although there are spells included they are all from the series plus there are pages of them and it seems to drag on to much.i have to say i'm a dedicated fan but so far i'm not enjoying this sorry.
3,"Pretty Good, But . . .","This was a pretty good book, but I have some complaints. I hated the way the author described Cole Turner's demise in Season 5 as something that should have happened a long time ago. Cole Turner was the best character on that show, and I still hated the way he was written off. Also, the author's desciption of Hannah Webster as a shapeshifter, instead of a warlock (which is ridiculous, since any magical being can be a shapeshifter) was misleading. And I was sorely disappointed that there were no interviews of Shannen Doherty or Julian McMahon.Which is why this book received 3 stars, instead of 5."
1,Proof of Life: A Novel,"I remember why I have made it a point not to buy or read books based upon movies. While the movie caught my attention in a big way, this book did little to add to the experience beyond a few differences in minor details. What was worth reading were the excerpts from the Vanity Fair article, ""Adventures in the Ransom Trade"", and the book ""Long March to Freedom: Tom Hargrove's . . "" The full versions of these are worth tracking down."
3,It's a Pot,"What can you say about a pot..not a lot. The set of circulon I purchased years back did not have a small pot, so I figured, why not? It's just right for boiling an egg, heating a can of soup or whipping up a little instant potatoes. I previously learned you cannot throw these pots into the dishwasher, but if you treat them well, the finish will wash clean of most burned foods."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!!!,I have a 2 year old 8 lb mini dachshund/pincher. After I applied the product he started freaking out and tried to rub it off for a good hour. After that he just laid and stayed in place but I could tell something was wrong. I left him alone because I figured he would get over it as he usually does when I apply this other flea medication from CVS. The next day my brother started noticing his ears twitching one at a time consistently. After my brother told me what he noticed I bathed him immediately and then I bathed him immediately again after that and made sure I washed that stuff off. By now I know its in his blood stream and people have said there's chemicals in this product which can affect your animal's neurological system. Please read reviews online before purchasing this. I don't know what to do. I feel so guilty for not researching about this product first.
4,Ambient Beats,"Not really a dance-oriented recording. It's essentially an environment with beats: a lot of overlapping background noises with the occasional hip-hop break. It's a good 'background' recording - something to play in the background while chilling out - although it can stray into Jungle territory now and then. Also sounds great over headphones. Of interest to David Shea fans would be to play 'Sample Cross Reference Trivia' while listening; some of the ""Down River"" samples can also be heard on Shea's ""Prisoner"", ""Hsu-Yu Chi"", and ""Tower of Mirrors""."
4,Esq Venture Watch 01700744,"I like the design (simple) and the look (elegant). I like the colors because they match my car. It keeps excellent time. the only thing that bothers me about it is that it is very hard to get on and off. The first clasp is easy, but the second part of it is not. You really have to push with your fingernail to release it. I suppose this guarantees that it will not fall off, but if you are in a hurry, it is frustrating. Also, there was very little instruction and nothing at all about the two clasps--no hint of what to do; it was trial and error. Otherwise, I really like the watch."
5,"Classic, gloriously corny country music","Wahoo! Nashville really needs to start putting out more reissues that are as good as this one! Wagoner was the last of the unreformable hicks, gloriously corny, yet country to the bone. This disc covers a lot of his best material, including the absurdly maudlin recitations such as ""Skid Row Joe"" and ""What Would You Do If Jesus Came To Your House?"" People eat those novelty tracks up with a spoon, but you should also check out his awesome weepers, such as ""I'll Go Down Swinging"" and ""Satisfied Mind."" One of the best CDs in this series -- highly recommended."
3,essential porter wagoner,It would have been nice to have had two lesser known hits he was just as famous foar such as Dooley and Julie. The latter was written by Waylon Jennings and the 45 version is the only available hit version. The LP version is totally different.
3,Good for the Coffee Table,"My coffe table looks good with this on it and people do pick it up when they come over. There are alot of good works of Da Vinci in here though not all of his art is covered. I do like the fact that some of the paintings are broken down, showing the undersketches and practice drawings. I have tried my hand at replicating a few of the drawings and am overwelmed at the quality of the paintings done centuries ago. The skin is luminouse!Hey, come on, it's cheap & fun. Buy it!"
3,"The human, not so much the saint","The author explains how she was attracted to this life because she too was the youngest daughter in her family and identified with Therese Martin. She describes in a somewhat dispassionate way the unusual (even among contemporaries) home life of Therese's family, and is at pains to separate the facts from the interpretation which Therese's own book _Story of a Soul_ would sometimes put on it. The author is clearly very sympathetic with the situation in life that Therese was in, but stays clear of hero worship when detailing the very remarkable facts of life and subsequent canonization. The portion of the book describing Therese's final agonizing illness are truly harrowing, with a measure of outrage at how she was allowed to suffer to a degree which was quite unneccessary. As she quotes only very sparingly from _Story of a Soul_ it should not be considered to be a replacement for that work."
1,Appalling,"I found this author's twisted ""re-evaluation"" absolutely sickening. Monica Furlong apparently believes Therese became a nun to avoid ""uncontrolled childbearing"", though she offers nothing to back up this assumption. Though she originally admits Therese's tuberculosis was incurable, she still manages to blame the convent for her death. She has absolutely no appreciation of Catholic spirituality, and lacking this cannot begin to comprehend the life of a great saint. She apparently feels Therese of Lisieux would have been better off living like a character in ""Sex and the City"". An excellent example of how spiritually impoverished modern feminism really is."
1,Save your time and money,"Awful book--Furlong admits in the introduction that she is embarrased to be interested in Therese and does not like the Catholic Church or Christianity in general. Furlong obviously has an agenda. She takes every selfless act or kind gesture by Therese and turns it into something neurotic or perverse. Furlong has very little sympathy for Therese's childlike faith. If you want to know about Therese of Lisieux, I recommend 'St Therese-the Little Flower' by John Beevers. I put this book in the trash."
5,Funny............,"I saw the second half of this on Comedy cental and had to buy it,,,it was a real funny...before catching the end i had never heard of Hannibal, but glad i caught it...it was pretty on point."
1,Review of Legasy,I purchaes this book because I really ejoyed Ezekiel Option but I could not relate to this book
2,Not As Good As It Could Have Been,"Although this book does give some basic information about Buddhism, I found it misleading as well. Erricker is obviously an ""outsider"" looking in on Buddhism and does not seem to have all his facts straight. After researching Buddhism myself, I found that this book was not adequate in teaching someone about Buddhism. I would think twice before buying this book."
3,Not a bad beginner book,"This book, in my opinion, concentrates too much on the Western view of Buddhism. It leaves the reader (especially the begginer) with the feeling that England (as well as some of the organizations mentioned in the book) is the authority in Buddhism. However, this book does serve as a begginer's guide to Buddhism. It gives a basic rundown of Buddhism as a whole. What I found most useful was the section on customs and festivals but the book is useful overall. For the reader who is expecting ""enlightenment"" or just a comprehensive look into Buddhism, this book will not prove very helpful. However, the general reader will find it a valuable foundation. I recommend the book by Donald S. Lopez, Jr., ""The Story of Buddhism: A Concise Guide to Its History & Teachings"" for readers who are seeking further knowledge of Buddhism."
1,They've got to do better,"A good book on the subject has to convey the spirit as well as the letter of Buddhism.This book pays lip service to some of the letters but lacks the spirit of Buddhism being unbalanced and innaccurate for a true understanding of the subject.Some of the picture captions are plain wrong. At my last viewing there was a leaf of Ficus religiosa, of enormous significance for Buddhists labelled as a ""palm leaf"" anything but! Maybe they'll improve."
4,good intro,"This book gives more of a historical and informational account of Buddhism, rather than teachings and beliefs. It talks of Buddha himself, the different flavors and divisions of Buddhism, Buddhism as it exists in different countries, Buddhist practices and ceremonies, and a basic introduction to beliefs centered around the precepts Buddhist monks follow. Again, it doesn't go too deeply into beliefs, and really only gives a few passages from notable belief texts. What other reviewers say about the FWBO is true, indeed the whole of the last 5 pages or so is a complete sales pitch on the organization. However, it certainly didn't pervade the book or cloud the information being presented."
4,colorful and fun,A wonderful compilation. This colorful release gets you in the mood to dance and travel.
4,A really great book!,"This is a really great book. Randy Cook is a refreshing new character. The story is a great combination of thriller, with a sensitive side. I would place Mr. Tomasso's writing on the same level as that of John Sanford's (a truely great thriller writer). Mr. Tomasso builds the story in a way that keeps you anticipating what will happen next. I would recommend this book to all those who love a good thriller. I look forward to reading another book by Mr. Tomasso."
3,Not long lasting,"I got this to use with urethane based grouts. It works fine... but I'm a newbie DIYer so take that with a grain of salt. I did notice that a couple of the corners started to wear out after just grouting my bathroom floor. The float has 2 rounded corners and 2 sharp corners, after just 1 file job, I can see that both of the sharp corner started to round off."
1,why did this cd get printed ?,This is the worst rap cd ever in my opinion. The beats sound like they were made by a two year old boy. They all rap about the same thing killing and balling. The only part I like in the cd is brotha lynch hung's verse
2,Not a particularly well written or accurate history,This is one of the most annoying histories I've read.In it everything seems to be excusable. In the run up to the war there appears to be an explanation for all manner of incompetence whether the Navy's inability to prepare for Pearl Harbor or the failure of the bureaucracy to react appropriately to the threat. (Similar to our current government's inability to be accountable for Iraq and even missing the clues to 9/11) McArthur is presented as a flawless leader who heroically stands outside on Corregidor while the bombs are falling and his subordinates scurrying for cover--behaviour not documented elsewhere.The book is revisionist and not a worthy history of the era and certainly not in the same league as Rick Atkinson's recent histories of the was in North Africa and Italy and posited by another reviewer.
