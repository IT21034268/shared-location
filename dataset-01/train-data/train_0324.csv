1,A major disappointment,"This is certainly not want was expected from PBS/Frontline, which usually produces some good documentaries, whether you agree with their viewpoint or not.Rather, this was a poorly structured, wandering commentary that would have you believe that Rove invented negative campaigning (he didn't) and that it is used exclusively by the Republicans (not hardly.)It starts out in a somewhat organized fashion discussing Rove's background and the application of modern demographics and marketing to political messaging and campaigning, but quickly degenerates into some kind of Washington Post editorial piece of the evils of Republican campaigning the Bush administration (what a surprise, considering the source.)If you are a student of political campaigns and messaging, this documentary is a major disappointment and really doesn't add any value."
5,Review Garry Robinson book on MSAccess Protection,Real World Microsoft Access Database Protection and SecurityI found it to be a good rescouce of the various stages of MSAccess DB developing protection for a data base. The end user would also benefit by having a reliable data base.Braxton Foist
2,Would not use again.,"I bought this along with another brands flea collar for another pet.As with the other,this did not get rid of fleas.It didn't even lessen the amount.I ended up purchasing Frontline product and that has worked greatly.I will likely never purchase a flea collar again."
1,Hartz Company uses TOXIC chemicals DO NOT BUY,I just called the EPA in on this company. do not buy their products or any flea product that conntains the chemicals Pyrethrins It's the same chemical that in in RAID!!! YES and the enviromantal deparment told me so. This company and several others puts this product on our shelves and some pets react violently to it. My Bulldog was sick for almost 24 hours. Please see the youtube link called DANGEROUS PET PRODUCTS IT'S very good. and be careful what you buy shampoo too !!! I used the shampoo and she was so sick
5,Worked well for me,I just moved to Mississippi and my 3 New York Chihuahua had never know what a tick was. Obviously these Mississippi Ticks didn't know what a New York Chihuahua was because they all wanted a taste of them.I was plucking 2-3 a day off my little guys. I did treat the yard with a bag of bug granules from Lowes. I only treated near the house since I didn't want any ticks on me. I didn't treat the rest of the 20 acres where the dogs often go exploring. I placed these collars on them and for 60 days not one tick or flea. Not even a bite. The collars actually have a pleasant smell. After 60 days free of ticks I did spot 2 ticks total in the span of the next few weeks. These are advertised a 6 month collars. I'm sure they would reduce infestation for 6 months but not 100%. So I decided for $5 the collar had served its purpose and placed fresh ones. Some might need a stronger collar but for my 5-10lb Chihuahuas these worked well.
1,Hartz UltraGuard Collar,"The Hartz Ultraguard Collar did not help the flees at all! I have a brittany spaniel with a minor flee issue and I thought a flee collar would do the trick but this one did not. He might as well be not even using it. However, the Hartz flee shampoo worked like magic."
3,nice swim trunks,"I bought these shorts to double as summer shorts and swim trunks. The belt that comes with it is elastic, I had to replace it with a non-elastic draw cord so that I could dive into the pool without losing my shorts. With the drawstring hanging out the front, I just use them as swim trunks. They're comfortable, they have a zip pocket in the back that keeps change and keys secure while you swim and velcro tabs on the cargo pocket, plus standard slash pockets in front. Another feature, they are packable, which is you can turn the hip pocket inside out and stuff the whole thing into it."
5,IQuest the World's Best,"I was 12 years of age when I received the iquest handheld. I am advising you this item is worth your money and is very educational. Take it from me i have one and it really helps me, so make your choice choose the world's best the iquest."
4,iQuest - review by Cameron,I bought this with the money my great grandpa George gave me for Christmas. It is an educational tool. I really enjoy the anagram game.
5,great ceiling fan,"works great, don't buy the remote though, anyone in the neighborhood can and will turn the fan on."
4,Great Buy for a Quality Fan,"Instruction should have included how to add a dropdown rod(12""), longer then one provided, for a vaulted ceiling. Other then that installation went smooth. Fan has very little wobble on high, did not try to adjust. Free shipping, WOW."
5,quiet breeze,A very nice and quiet ceiling fan. Quality and quietness are what Hunter ceiling fans are all about.
4,good fan,Great fan for the price. Installed in the bedroom and really quiet even at highest speed. Installation not as easy as instructions state. Really a 2 person project when installing the rod to the ceiling. I definitely would buy another of the same model.
3,ceiling fan,I replaced a Hunter fan that was at least 30 years old. It was much better and moved mor air than the new one. it is working O.K. again not as much air movement as the old one.
1,broken,upon opening the box i found that one of the fan blade brackets was cracked. Returns are such a pain on amazon i decided to try and just put some super glue on the crack. hung the fan and everything was looking good. turned the fan on low. and the blade went flying across the room.
5,hunter summer breeze fan style 25511,"Beautifull fans,I bought 5 for our log house to circulate the air,we have 50 foot ceilings.They are very quiet and will be running most of the year.We are hopping they will run a long time,so far so good.Not the easiest fan to put together but they good quality and very sturdy."
2,Humpton Bay is better,I bought this fan but after failing to install it I returned and bought the Hampton Bay fan.The installation was difficult. The instructions are so confusing it took me hours to install (and I am an engineer). I believe the instructions are written in China and maybe they make sense to Chinese customers. I ended up buying the Hampton Bay fan which has much clearer instructions and it made better. A similar Hampton Bay fan is also cheaper.
4,Works ok,"This fan works ok but the blade irons are particularly fragile. I broke a couple of them. Fortunately I got spares off the previous fan I had as replacement irons are only sold in sets of 5. My fan is in a house trailer and I am 6'5"" tall so I run into it occasionally. Everything else is ok and it has been running for a year now without any noise, except for a couple days once. I even have some spare blade irons now just in case.My last fan burned out during an electrical brown-out. A brown-out would ruin this fan just as easily. It is a good idea to turn the fan off as quickly as possible during a brown-out or it will be ruined. A brown out is when the electric is only at 50% passing low current, which burns out the motor windings."
2,Just okay,"Purchased this to go in my work chair and I must say the pad itself feels great, but its the securing part that is an issue. The straps are way to long and no way to secure them so that they aren't all over the place. They need to add snapping straps instead of the slide straps."
1,Not that great,"This did not have straps long enough to fit around the back of my office chair, so I was unable to secure properly. Therefore, it kept sliding around, and was not comfortable. It is basically a piece of curved plastic with eggshell padding on it. Definitely not worth the sticker price, and not even the cost of sending it back."
1,Counseling/Therapy Cases,Disappointed with the Counseling and Therapy Cases discussed in this book since I was expecting great insight and wisdom. The only Case that was worthwhile and worth remembering was the adult man who brought a gun to the Counseling Office and how this Therapist and Receptionist dealt with this.Nestor Mantilla
1,Not what I expected,"I have been very disappointed with this book. I bought it because I was at a professional conference and met Dr. Gladding. He suggested this book to me (I'm a beginning counselor). I got it home and started reading...and stopped a few chapters in. His short stories about his experiences as a new counselor are pretty dry and written with a sense of humor that I simply don't find funny. I'm at a point in my new career where I have a thirst for information that will add to my counseling abilities/style, and this book certainly does not do so! Sorry, Dr. Gladding!"
1,Great watch but NOT water resistant!,"I have owned two of these watches, one of which I bought from Amazon. Both of them ended up leaking after a few months... showing water on the inside of the crystal... just from swimming laps... nothing deep. It's a very pretty watch and runs well, but don't wear it while swimming."
3,suggested reading to staff,As a CEO of high tech company we are always on the lookout for practical books that are business savvy. I will recommend that my staff read this book.
1,Buy at your own risk,"The product arrived damaged. I tried to call the store several times, but nobody ever answered the phone. I left a voicemail for customer service, but never received a followup call. I sent them an email as well, but again, no response. Save yourself the headache and buy another product from a more reliable store."
3,Different lining than pictured,This is a quality product priced well but I was very disappointed to get a green lining instead of the black shown in the image.
2,Ok Album For What It Is,"The people who think that this is Chicago's best album have obviously never listened to the original early 1970's Chicago or they just have really bad taste in music. First of all Chicago-16 (1982) is leaps and bounds better than this album for many reasons. This album is way to poppy and not only that most of the songs are so bad Stay The Night, Along Comes A Woman, Prima Donna and more the lyrics are terrible the only good song here is Hard Habit To Break and the only reason that song is good is because Bill Champlin/Peter Cetera do a great job singing together.Chicago in the 1980's is mostly forgetable their songs all sound the same and they are all mostly ballads for the mindless masses. Not that there is anything wrong with some pop music i like some of it but please stick to Chicago-16."
4,Great but could have been better,Overall this is a teriffic album. Where it falls short is with the song Please Hold On. The original LP had a different version than did the original CD...this release missed a golden opportunity to combine the 2 versions of what may be Chicago's best 1980's song.
3,Heard it before.,Thought this would be awesome because it said there was 'new' music. But it is all the same stuff that we have heard before. But Chicago is always good.
5,Love Chicago!,"It is so fun finding not only all the music I can from this wonderful group, but the 'covers' are fun in of themselves. I own many albums already and am now buying the cds. Thank you!"
5,The Rat Pack Play Pool,"The picture is clear, clean and well framed. This was bought as a gift and I am excited to be the giver."
3,Well I can say this,Since I wasn't reading the book I can't make a judgment on the book.I was listening to the audio book and I can say this..Never in my life have I been subjected to a more dry and lifeless naraiton. Save yourself much agrivation and don't get the audio version. I would have loved a chance to get into the book but unfortunatly I couldn't stand the book long enough to have the oppritunity.
4,The wild Baron,"I enjoyed this book,It was different from her other books, It covered the good and bad of the complete family of the Wild Baron. There is a mystery that turns out to be multiple mysterys. It is not confusing if you take one mystery at a time. entertaining and different but not the best she was written. a real messed up family!"
2,I finished it only becouse it is Coulter's book,"Usually I love Catherine Coulter's books, but this was a first for me - I didn't enjoy it. If you are searching for a good book, don't read this one. Try Coulter's others book - you will find them much better."
2,"Love Catherine Coulter books, didn't love this one....","As a rule, I consistently love Catherine Coulter's Historical Romance Novels. However, I thought there might be something amiss when this one was brought out directly to paperback. I was disappointed, the dialog was stilted and the story was pretty far out there, which is saying alot for a romance novel. I'll keep reading, but no more of these please"
5,Perfect fit replacement,"I lived in the great lakes area and had this particular vehicle for 3 winters in the cold and the ice and the SALT. Oh how I hate salt. It affects almost every metal component on a vehicle. After I moved back down south my brakes needed to be worked on and one of the components that didn't hold up very well were the bottom caliper pins on the front brakes. The caliper pin boots didn't keep all the salt out and the bottom pins on both sides were very corroded. When trying to remove the pins the boot on one side tore so I had to get new ones. These boots were a perfect fit and hopefully will do a good job of preventing my new pins from corroding anytime soon, since they were a little more snug then the ones that had 10 years of wear and tear on them. Since I'm in the south now it may not matter quite as much, either way I'm just happy to have my brakes working properly now."
4,Blind Fear / Bone Daddy,"I was bored & thought this dvd is too cheap of a price to even want to watch it. Surprisingly, both movies turned out better than expected. I didnt know it was the same girl who played some roles in Charlie's Angels, Shelley Hack, wow. I would rate this 4-5 Stars. very old-school suspense."
5,Glo Minerals lip gloss,I love this gloss. It is neutral and makes any other color worn under it more rich and lustrous. I will buy it again.
3,Expensive but nice.,GloMinerals products cost more but the quality is there. They have unusual colors that are not offered by other makeup lines.
5,GREAT BOOK,This book was excellent. My Daughter loves it and loves to hear it over and over - it reminds her that being a baby isn't much fun since they don't do much and she can do so much that she wouldn't want to go back to being a baby but she'd love to show them and teach them as they grow up. I recommend this book to anyone thinking about a second child or even to anyone who's little one wants to remain a baby instead of growing up into a toddler.
4,Not Free SF Reader,"A book that is a literary puzzle, an adventure of sorts, and full of sneakiness and tongue-in-cheekness. I have read quite a lot, and when I read this, I had trouble trying to work out who was who in quite a lot of cases. I suppose this is a lot of the appeal, though, being like a really, really hard cryptic crossword, at times."
3,"Great film, VHS quality.","I had been waiting paiently for this film to arrive on DVD. When I finally purchased it, I was disappoited that the quality was not much better than my VHS tape.Oh well, that is the risk you take. If you own the VHS version, stick to it until a different company releases a remastered print."
2,cheapness,i think this product is cheap and not described as well as it could be. not very happy with this purchase. i dont even use it it is a back up for that junky reason
3,Good price.,Does the job for a good price but is a bit loud and i still need more water flow through my 45 gal. it will eventually be replaced by an enheim.
5,"Simple text, beautiful illustrations, and fun - my 18 month old loves it!","We love interactive books that make the reading experience with our 18-month old a little more hands on and involved. There are only about 4 full pages and very little text but the pull-outs on each page kept him busy for about 20 minutes while we read through and talked about the bees, birds, easter eggs, baby ducks, etc. And now he's been carrying it around with him so we can play some more. This is one the neatest little hands on books we've seen. My only concern is how long the easter eggs will last with him pulling them out and opening them up - but we have plenty of glue :)"
4,fabulous!,"My son loves to point at the animals and pull out the little tabs in this Easter book. the egg makes me nervous because he really yanks them, but so far they've proved to be quite hardy! This is one of the first books my son refuses to put down (he is 14 months) and loves to read it over and over and over and over...."
4,A different Tom Jones....,"This album starts off with a roar (literally) with ""If I Only Knew"", a song that perfectly highlights the fantastic power in Tom's voice. The rest of the album is a strange collection of songs, many nothing like fans of traditional Tom Jones would be used to hearing. There are some great tracks with the typical Jones voice in full flight - I particularly like ""Changes"" the last song featured. I enjoy this album for the variety it offers and the fact that it moves right away from the ""cabaret style"" on many of Tom's greatest hits. Besides, the cover has one of the best shots of Tom in a mesh singlet I've ever seen! Worth buying."
4,Exceptional,Was shipped quickly and given tracking information. Product arrived on time and meet all standards. Would recommend shipper for future purchases.
1,FAKE,This is not the real thing. I am completely DISSATISFIED with this FAKE perfume. I want a refund and I will never purchase any perfume from amazon again
5,Returning customer,This is my sister-in-law's favorite perfume. Last Christmas I searched all over for it & finally found it on Amazon. This year I just went directly to Amazon & saved so much time.The perfume was shrink wrapped & reasonable in price. Thanks!
4,Beautiful but not long lasting........,"This is a beautiful scent but does not last long. It has a very strong scent of honyesuckle and stays with the drydown also. This is sweet and not for everyone, I like it alot but perfer stong and powerful scents better but this is a great summer scent!"
3,airy and light,It's light although it doesn't last long. For the money I found it doable. Evening and day it works for me.
1,synthetic,"The jasmine note in this fragrance is overpowering to the extent of smelling synthetic, am totally disappointed"
1,"False Advertisement, in my book.. I got 1/3 of what I ordered!","I wanted a 3 tier paper tray, as shown in the picture, but only got 1/3 of it. they shipped me just one & supposedly they're ""Stackable."" I order on Amazon all the time! & this is the first time I've ever gotten something other than what was shown in the picture. I'm definately going to call them & get a refund some how- & I do not want to pay for shipping or go to UPS or fedex. I will try & arrange so they come to me or something, or I get to keep the tray & get my full refund. not to sound like a jerk, but dude- what do u expect?"
3,it is as stated.. paper tray: not trays,"I was disappointed in the fact that I thought I was getting a 3 tier paper tray and I only got 1. The picture is showing you what it CAN look like when you stack the trays.. That is if you buy more than one. The description says 'Black Mesh Stackable Paper Tray' as in singular; NOT trays, plural. So it is our fault for seeing what we want to see instead of what is really there..."
4,Great Orlando Resource,My wife and I found this book to be very helpful while planning our trip to Orlando. After reading this book we wondered if we would have time to go to Disney. The book contains a lot of well organized information and would be very helpful to anyone planning on visiting Orlando.
3,O'Hara's Hollywood Story,"John O'Hara wrote in several geographies: Gibbsville, PA; Manhattan, NY; and Hollywood. The Big Laugh is one of his Hollywood novels. In his entire body of work (and it is prodigious), I would put this in the bottom 25%. It begins with a nobody forging a career in hollywood by blackmailing the first person to give him an acting job. A weak premise not usually found in O'Hara's plots. It ends with a twist -- hence the Big Laugh. This is the type of novel that is only enjoyed by someone who is a diehard fan of the author. The plotting is weak; it's missing the dialogue and little details that are a hallmark of O'Hara's outstanding work."
5,VERY NICE IMSTRUMENTALS!,Whether you are into music production or not this album will be much appreciated. All beats have that 'darkchild' sound about them which will not dissappoint his many fan. This album shows why he is one of the most sought after producers in the industry.
3,Just a little information,"The following information is taken or paraphrased from the cover. This book is divided into three parts. There are 129 drawings, diagrams, and black and white reproductions of art as well as 20 full color illustrations. Hardcover, 176 pages, 8-1/2"" x 11"".Part one covers the observation of nature discussing line direction, the relationship of points and of separate shapes, plus the interaction of straight and curved lines. It introduces the reader to plumbing, point-to-point drawing, scale, planes, tone and modelling.Part two deals with color, tone, advancing and receeding colors, palettes, and analyzing colors in nature.Part 3 deals with composition."
3,Solid live set,"This live recording, from the last year of his life, shows Rene Thomas in his natural habitat - some Dutch club with a swinging combo of euro-jazzers and bop partisans. Thomas was on the fringes of the European echo of ""modern jazz"" and played with Sonny Rollins in the late fifites, and surprisingly well with Chet Baker in Italy in the early seventies. Four tunes - no frills, professional and sometimes startingly electric. At times in Rene Thomas' sound you can hear the emergence of the post-rock jazz guitar of abercrombrie, frisell and others. (Don't know why I gave this 3 stars. It's easily worth 4, but I can't seem to edit that part of the review.)"
2,No memory!,"The oven works great after you program the time. I use one like this one every day for the same thing with a manual timer and it is FAR superior because it takes so long to program the time each and every time you use it. I gave this one away to a friend and went back to my old one (half the cost).There is nothing wrong with how it works as an oven, I just could not put up with the inconvenience of setting the timer."
2,Let down,"Since this was for a child I was disappointed in the content. I had hoped for more organization, colors and interactions."
3,Isy breast,"Very bad sound !!! The movie itself is so so, but worth seeing thanks to Delon ...... Rest of the cast, incl M. Darc do not show anything above the average......."
3,It was okay,It worked pretty good for the first month and then it stopped spraying each time my labador would bark..
3,Worthy acheivement but too long and squeaky for comfort.,"This set has the distinction of being the only opera set I've ever let go of second hand. The high voices are just to much to take over 4 CDs. Yet on the other hand Michael Schneider's 2CD and 4 soprano Paride ed Elena by Gluck (also Capriccio half the length and a third of the price of this set) is very listenable. So maybe it is just length?Christie's cast includes Emma Kirkby, Agnes Mellon (sopranos), Derek Lee Ragin, Randall K Wong (male sopranos) and Dominique Visse, David Cordier (counter tenors).If you aren't familiar with Hasse maybe start with Schneider's 2-for-1 Piramo e Tisbe before buying this."
2,Overhyped,"A good friend absolutely waxed poetic about this series of books and insisted I try one. ""You'll want to read all of them!"" she promised. Well, I just finished the first installment in the popular series and I say, no more! From reading the many rave reviews, I've had to conclude that I'm totally out of the loop on this one, because I found the story to be hideously contrived, stupendously vapid and, considering the AIDs epidemic that decimated San Francisco's more amorous citizens just a decade later, amazingly irresponsible. We're supposed to look upon the exploits of these shallow and self-centered 70s people as great fun? Sorry, but I don't buy it. Anybody who thinks Maupin's ""tales"" depict some kind of Utopian past needs to shake the cobwebs out of their head and get a life. If self-indugence and an account of risque (and risky) behaviors typically amuses you, you'll probably enjoy this book. If your reading tastes run a bit deeper, don't waste your time with this tripe."
2,REALLY NOT A LOT OF FUN TO READ,"I was born and raised in ""THE CITY"". Having said that, thiswas not a lot of fun to read. There is so much more ""THE CITY""has to offer other than sex, gayness, sex, gayness, depravity, sex,cheating spouses, and, more sex. I just did not enjoy reading this."
1,quick read that got boring after a few chapters,quick read that got boring after a few chapters. would not buy any of the sequals.
4,I wish Maupin were real life!,"I first read this series in high school and have since picked it up at least once a year for a good re-read. In college, when faced with an unexpectedly boring batch of freshmen, I found myself wishing these characters were real. Now, as a young woman on her own for the first time, I totally identify with Mary Anne Singleton's quest for independance and a new life in ""Tales of the City."" I now also understand how friends can become adjunct family. I can't wait to re-read these books again and again, hoping to understand even more as I get older. The only down-side is that life seems oddly dull by comparison to Maupin's twisted, witty, and very special world."
4,Soap operatic. (if you're not interested in visiting Frisco),"As I do not plan to get to San Francisco in the near future, my opinion of the book is purely in regard to it as a yarn.Much as I enjoyed it, it struck me as soap-operatic at times. For example, the level of interconnectedness is hard to believe. I thought only Melrose Place could have a situation where the doctor whom A goes to just happens to have been the lover of A's father's secretary's neighbour and just happens to later sleep with A's husband.But perhaps the city is actually like that.More specific comments: Norman's secret is worse than soaps. But D'Orothea's secret is really really good -- imaginative, plausible, lateral thinking and a great comment on life in the fast lane."
5,speechless,"I almost didn't want to review this because it is SO, SO fabulous that I literally cannot think of the words to describe it!So I just want to share that this book (as well as More and Further Tales) is one of the best reading experiences of my life and the stories will linger with me literally forever. As insane as it sounds it feels like the characters of this book are my good, good friends and that I could call them up or go to San Francisco and find them and their fabulous world waiting (and I've had other readers tell me the same thing so don't call the mental hospital for me yet)! Armistead Maupin is a literary god as far as I'm concerned! One of the best authors of all time! I could not recommend a book or a series more."
2,I just couldn't get into it,"I've heard so many people say the Tales of the City series was so incredible, and I've read all the reviews on this page, but I couldn't even get through the first book (and I've lived in the Bay area all my 22 years). To me, it lacked richness and colorful descriptions, and very little ""happened"" except for the most mundane of situations. San Francisco just didn't ""come through"" the pages for me."
5,rememberances of things past,"Evertime I open up the Tales series, memories flood into my mind.Perhaps everyone falls a little in love with their childhood city, but very few have a chronicler as Armistead Maupin.(pun intended)Dorthy went to the Emerald City and no she didn't go back to Kansas, she stayed."
2,Okay. No more.,"After reading this, I found it hard to remember exactly what had happened in it. Some of the characters are interesting, especially Mrs. Madrigal and Michael Tolliver. But I have not felt the need to read the others, and will probably never need to re-read this one. An amusing diversion, nothing more."
5,We need more Tales of the City!,I loved this series of books so much that I've spent a lot of time looking for anything that will remotely compare. In the last year I've found a couple of books that caught me in their snare as well. Tim Farrington's California Book of the Dead and the other is Alex Garland's The Beach. Both have a set of characters that really involve you in the story. I just wish there could be more Tales of the City!
5,The epitome of fabulousity,"Last summer, I picked up Armistead Maupin's Tales of the City and began to read. One week and 2,000 pages later, I finished and found myself incredibly depressed the series had finally been drawn to a close. What a wonderful world they had at 28 Barbary Lane. Granted, it didn't last for very long and some of the characters (Mary Ann!) became horrible people, but it was still enjoyable all the way through to the last page of the sixth book. Highly recommended for anyone who desires a quick (unless you become addicted to the series like me), extremely entertaining read."
3,Funny and Charming,"Reading this book is a bit like a history lesson. Set in San Francisco in the late-1970s, this book was remarkable for presenting homosexuality as part of mainstream popular culture. In 2011 this is hardly shocking, but thirty-five years ago it was. This is important to recognize before going into the book.With the stage set, I felt like this book read like a sitcom. The characters engage in crazy antics. They get involved in humorous love triangles. The series began in the newspaper, and I can see how that shapes the book. The book is comprised of short chapters and small vignettes. It is humorous and easy reading, a bit of mind candy.By the end I was left with some unanswered questions. What was the issue with the landlady? As this is the first book in a series, I'm going to assume that Maupin is setting up for the next book. I'll be reading it to find out."
3,"Lovable, but ultimately voiceless","I adore this series, and we all know that the original is always the best, but I see this book as the pilot episode of a television series. Plagued with pacing problems, as well as fairly one dimensional characters with few honest surprises, this is not the strongest offering of the series. That said, it's a good start, and it did make me want to read more, I just wish it felt like a more solidly constructed book. That said, ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" has a terrible pilot, too, and that's my favorite show."
5,Great book.,"I do understand why such a large fan base developed in San Francisco, when these stories first came out by chapters in the newspaper. Maupin is a great story-teller. And he narrates the audiobook. Great read and a great gift."
5,"I Don't even Like to Read, But I Loved This Book","After seeing the Miniseries on PBS (and buying it later) I became interested in this book, and then when out and got the rest of the series. I don't even like to read, but I just couldn't put this book down. Well worth getting the entire series to see what happens to all of your favorite characters through the times"
3,A bit disappointed,"After reading all the rave reviews I was expecting something better. Although the book contains several memorable characters, it has a mediocre style, poor structure, and lack of focus. The ""society"" people were completely inscrutable and the chapters about them were a waste of time. But the worst sin of the book is that the Mary Ann character is nothing more than a plot device."
4,A metaphor for our lives...,"The only reason this isn't getting five stars is because Mary Ann irritated me so darn much in the beginning. :)I saw the mini-series, read the book, then started making my friends do likewise. We still explain situations in terms of the series. The friend who lived with me for the first three years after college and I were often described as ""Mouse and Mona"" and everyone knew what we were talking about.This first book in the series is the fastest-moving, lightest, and for some might be the most enjoyable. It wasn't for me; I considered More Tales superior. But read this one first, get to know and love the characters, and then just keep reading!"
4,Emotion and intrigue,"The compelling story of an apartment building brimming with some of the most interesting San Fransiscan characters one could imagine. Well written and believable, this story gets a strong recommendation from me."
4,Very interesting characters,This book really gets involved with individual characters which make it extremely interesting...All the different types that their paths meet and how different people can be but how they can all connect with one another in their own individual way. It is a very fun reading book. I enjoyed it.
5,Great Strait!,Great CD compilation! I'm glad they were able to fit all the songs on two CD's. Very convenient. It's great to have them all together. Great value!
3,George Strait CD,This was a gift for a George Strait fan on her birthday. She enjoyed it a great deal. It was a hit.
5,Does it Get Any Better?,"George Strait's new greatest hits album blew me away with the great selection of all the George tunes that I have been listening to all my life. I love ""The Chair"" and some of the other classic songs like I Cross My Heart. I wish that ""Good Time Charley's"" would have made it to number one so it could have been included on this album. I have read that some people did not like the ""shortening"" of the songs but I did not notice anything like that. All the great strait sound was still in every track."
4,Completely Misleading!,"Don't get me wrong. I think this is a great collection of hits. And since I am not an expert on George Strait, I can not tell you the exact length each and every song is supposed to be. My guess is that they usually edit them for airplay, and those are the hit versions here. No, I am more dissapointed that the title lies and tells everyone that George Strait has 50 number one hits which is totally untrue. I was impressed until I checked the facts. George has topped the country singles charts 39 times to date. This album does contain each and everone of those number ones. But there are 12 songs that are not, and that is where it is totally misleading the public. All the songs are top ten hits though and not one is a dissapointment. I really like this album. But the title is an out and out lie."
5,strait to the top,"I found this album absolutely amazing,Ihave alway's liked George Strait but to find so many brilliant songs on one cd was great.I think the next george strait is going to be Joe Nicholls."
1,EVERY song has been edited to fit on 2 discs!,not recommendedthere is anywhere from 2-45 seconds cut in every songI'd say George wasn't thinking straight when he ok'd this release chopping his songs into little pieces.most TRUE artists have a little more respect for their own songs than that!
5,George Strait 50 Number Ones,"George Strait, 50 Number Ones! Super, need I say more? He's the best and, well 50 of his best, Super!"
5,this is an awesome cd,i really like this cd it's my favorite everyone should go out and buy a copy today. trust me you won't regret it. george is the best country singer ever!
5,Add this to your country collection,"Two people come to mind when you think of #1 hits...Conway Twitty and George Strait. Both have remarkably sang hits that hit the heartstrings and on a level that fans enjoy. Strait has hit all of his major hits with this album. Upon reviewing it, I did notice that a few songs were cut by a few seconds or so. This should defer you from purchasing this album. It showcases the early days up to the current and most recent #1 hit, ""I Hate Everything."" George Strait keeps it country and keeps it real. For the true country fan, I recommend this album"
2,The radio's versions of George on CD,"As elucidated by a few previous reviewers, I was very disappointed by this latest compilation of George's classic (and not so classic) and COMPRESSED tunes.The reason why I buy CDs in the first place is to avoid the kind of editing, fade-outs, commercialization, and talk-overs that is applied to songs over the radio. Unfortunately, you get all of this, except the talk-overs, with this 2-CD set that brags through its label but fails to live up to its own hype and leaves you feeling empty after having listened to it. Murder on Country Music Row anyone?I'm sure MCA got what they wanted with this spoof of an effort. The fans? Unless you are in marketing for those media giants and looking for new angles on how to edit great songs to add more commercials into your daily repertoire, you're not missing much. Unfortunately, that's more than I can say for this album!"
2,George Strait Cut Short,"Like many of the reviewers of this CD, I am very disappointed with this CD. Many of the selections on this CD are cut short, some songs have verses/choruses missing, and some even fade out before the song is supposed to be over. And what happened to ""Amarillo By Morning""??? I recommend purchasing George Strait's box set or his individual CDs instead of this bargin-basement CD. Save your money. I HIGHLY DO NOT RECOMMENDED THIS CD!"
1,Each song has been edited and sliced up...,What would have been a great release is now something I probably wouldn't even buy in the bargain bin. What were the music executives thinking? Does George have any say in what they do to his music. Pick up his box set or some of his other greatest hits album. Let the industry know not to Ginzu beautiful music like this.
3,Don't get this one!,"Don't get this one. Although you can't go wrong with any George, this one is not the best. Get the Box Set. George's best songs are the ones that aren't the number ones. Anyone ever heard of Amarillo by morning??? Trust me, get the Box Set, its worth it. Or if you're more into the newer stuff wait and get the inevitable comprehensive box set in a few years. This chopped up CD just doesn't cut it!"
5,Excellent compilation CD,"My hubby got this CD set for Christmas and has really enjoyed it. He is a major George Strait fan and has almost every album George has released and ranks ""50 Greatest Hits"" right up there with George's best.This album takes many of the best songs from the ""Strait Out of the Box"" set, as well as adding several songs that have been released since the box set, and combines them on 2 discs. Hubby thinks it's much easier to tote around this set than the 4-disc box set.Highly recommended for George Strait fans!"
4,robuster,"I am by no means a music expert but I have bought many albums in the last year and have no complaints. I have enjoyed everyone. This one was no different,my six year old grandson and I have spent the weekend learning the songs and had a great time doing it.I am a casual fan and know nothing of what makes a recording better or worse other then if I like it or not.I buy music for my kindle or my grandsons as this is the only device I listen to them on.For those of you who are hardcore music fans this review will mean little to you for those of you who just like a good song I hope this helps."
4,George's Hits,"Cramming twenty-two years and 51 songs on two albums is indeed an impressive feet. At the same time, I have noticed that many people seem to be upset about some of the songs being cut. Now I am a hard-core George fan. I've listened to George my whole entire life (21 years) and the cutting a few seconds really isn't that big of a deal. In all honestly one has to think about the costs that go into making cd's. It was more cost effective to maybe cut a few seconds off a song or two. I am just impressed and happy to own a cd of my favorite artists greatest hits. I love to listen to how the sounds of him music changed with the times, but on the same token his upbeat, amazing songs, and poetry of words have never changed. On that same note, George has never lost that million dollar smile. To me, it seems quite upsetting to hear people getting upset over a few seconds and not considering the time, effort, or hard work that actually went into the making of this album."
4,Happy Customer,The music is great. 50 songs by one of my favorite artists. Wow. Wonderful CD. If you like country music you will enjoy this CD
5,George Strait,I really like this CD. Very nice way to become familiar with Mr. Strait's music. His singles are all very listenable. I also like the fact that all of the singles are in chronological order. Great purchase.
1,In protest I left the edited album on the store shelf!!!!,I would rate this 0 stars but the lowest option available is one star. This is a very important historic release 50 # 1 hits.I can't believe that they would edit(shorten the songs from their original version). This is the life work of one of the most important artists in Country Music history. I am sure we would have all paid a couple of bucks more if they had to go to three disks to fit the songs into the collection. I wonder if George knows that they butchered up his songs.I wish I knew how to contact George Strait to find out how he feels about this and how the record company has upset his fans.I think he should make a public statement on this and file a lawsuit. Those of you who were unaware of the edits at the time of purchase should check with your stores return policy. Does anyone know how I can contact the record company to let them know how I feel.A very disappointed fan!!!!!
2,"LOVE George,HATE the chopped up songs.","Hey i agree with the two folks about the short songs. It's really unnerving to know the songs pretty much by heart and then get to the big finish and there's only one ""Does Ft. Worth ever...."" instead of the usual three lines of it. Half the fun is singing it three times,lol.It just feels wrong!! I love George, but like the other reviewer said, i'll probably listen to this once or twice and then go back to the original cds with the full versions of the songs. A big dud."
4,Better hearing than dismissing,"Karajan is too often portrayed as the man-who-draws-the-music-to-himself or an ideological aesthete and this account of Bruckner Fourth, while surely not the ultimate one, talks in favour of the Austrian Maestro. True there is power and strength, sometimes spectacularly but with some telluric outbursts reminding of other great brucknerians. But what this recording seems to bring is an unmistakable love of this music, which speaks of nature with the naivety, deepness and rawness of Sibelius or Stravinsky. Bruckner loved life and the beauty of the world. We hear only instruments and the result is intense poetry, like we can hear in Berlioz ""Fantastique"". With a kind of hypnotic flow. Not surprisingly, Karajan could also be masterly in Sibelius. Not very far from what Sanderling could do."
3,Not a Stellar Sibelius Set,"I should have been more suspicious about this set when I only paid twenty dollars.The performances are good, but the recording is awful. It is probably worst in the First Symphony Scherzo where the timpani motif sounds absolutely muddled.My favorite in this set is the Third Symphony. Perhaps I enjoy this one most because I haven't heard any other recordings of the work.I would strongly suggest Ashkenazy's Sibelius.Oh, and the Nielsen symphonies with Blomstedt are marvelous."
3,Afro Music Lounge,"I expected this album to have many electronic and trendy afro beats... Actually, no, not really.No new tracks even though it is released in 2001. Old stuff even dated to 1972. However, those older songs are better and more stylish than contemporary ones in this album. There are few very nice songs in this double CD album. Rest are average.Maybe it is meant for a lounge and background afro music suitable for dining in an European restaurant and you won't need to really listen to the songs carefully."
2,Disappointed,"I paid the high price and bought the 2 tier Molly and Friends Cat Tree in April, 7 months ago. The carpet is already shredded and missing and the sisal rope appears to be artificial and the cats use it only sparingly. I wish I could return it and get my money back!"
4,nice cat tree,"My cat likes this cat tree, however, the second cat doesn't realize it can get to the top pedestal. If the top perch had an opening in the front, the cat could easily see to jump up there. My one cat only uses the lower perch, and with him sitting there, the other isn't able to get to the top. I would suggest cutting out an arch in the front of the top perch to the builders of the product. Also, it had to be delivered 3x secondary to damage with shipping. Amazon was very helpful with re-ordering the product and the third time, went with a different shipping method. the box was still heavily damaged, but not the product."
2,Not a Premium product,"We have had this cat tree for almost a month. The box was beat up when it arrived but fortunately no damage to the tree. It was nice that it was assembled. Those are the good things. The sisal is pulling away from the tall post and the cats are tearing the carpet up. The shorter pole is covered in carpet and my one cat has already stripped the carpet from one side of it. It looks nice, is a good height, very sturdy, and the cats like sleeping in it but definitely poor quality workmanship and and material. I'm very disappointed after spending over $130. My cheap faux fur cat tree is in better shape after three years."
2,Top seat is broken and it's the wrong color,"I was really looking foward for this cat tree to arrive. I was very disappointed when I opened the box to find the tree in a chocolate brown. I had wanted the light neutral color so it would not stand out like a sore thumb in my house. Secondly, the top round seat is about really to fall off....very unstable and sits at a slant. I am returning this item and will just go to a local petstore to buy one...this was not worth the hassel. On a side note....the box was in good condition when it arrived."
3,cat furniture,"Well made, solid, but not appreciably better than similar stuff in pet stores at similar or lower prices Would have preferred better quality, more tightly woven carpeting. The scratch post rope is loose in a couple of places (probably came that way) and my 5 month old kitten hasn't even learned to use it."
3,Disappointed,"I was eagerly awaiting delivery of this product after I read mostly excellent reviews. It arrived today and the top tier platform is crooked.... angled at about 15 degrees. It appears to have been made that way, not damaged in delivery.This detracts from it's appearance and it remains to be seen whether my cats will accept it."
5,Very sturdy!!,I searched and searched for sturdy cat furniture.The furniture I saw in stores looked like it would fall over if a cat climbed on it. This is extremely well made and my cat loves laying in the donut hole:).
5,Better than expected!,"I researched a lot of cat furniture and selected this one based on the reviews (and color). This item shipped very fast and came fully assembled. The box looked like it took a beating, but the furniture was just fine inside. I'd rather that then have to assemble it myself. It is a great neutral color and very sturdy. My two cats were on it immediately and have rarely left it since. I was going to get the item with just the taller of the two perches, but I'm so glad I chose this one. Both of my cats play and sleep together on it. I highly recommend this item and definitely this brand."
5,the cats love it ...,"this item arrived yesterday and i am very pleased with the build quality. my two large cats love it and it is sturdy enough to stand up to their roughhousing. thankfully this item is so well made because the box it arrived in looked like it had been thrown out of a plane. beat up, torn, barely held together by loose packing tape and someone at ups or fed ex put a plastic bag around it so the box didn't fall apart. item gets five stars plus .. packing box - one star minus."
3,Good but overpriced,"We have 3 kittens that like the u-shape platform but they don't use the platter shaped platform. This surprised me as I thought they would love the circular shape. As for the quality, we have a 20 year old stand that is shaped just like the u-shape on this one. The cats fight over or share the old stand before they will use this new one. The old one supposedly had catknip embedded in it so that may be why they like it or possibly the smell of our old cat who has been gone for a couple of years now. I bought this based on the reviews even though it is more than double the cost of stands we see in local stores. The quality appears the same, not double."
4,Quality Product...a little pricey.,"My cats love the tree...but I've found similar trees at local pet stores that are much less expensive. Good, quality product though."
5,Surprisingly Easy to Read and Understand,"Being a PhD student in organic chemistry, I have read a lot of chemistry books in my days, and never have I come across a book that's understandable without a teacher's explanation. The numerous examples and pictures makes understanding what the author is writing about a breeze. I would highly suggest this book to anyone who is looking into pursuing a degree in Chemistry. It has already helped me out a great deal and I'm barely half way through!"
4,worth reading for senior undergraduate and 1st graduate student in chemistry,"For people who love organic chemistry, this book provides a basic guide for people to learn some basic but fundamental details of organic chem mechanism.The fourth chapter is expecially worthy reading. Moreover, Chapter 6 provides people with a rough idea of what's going on in organometallics filed."
5,This video is absolutely amazing!,"I watched this video originally on PBS Nature and I was glued to my seat! I went on an emotional roller coaster and knew immediately that I had to buy this. Everyone that comes over my house, I tell them to watch this because this is one of the best Nature segments I have watch and the first one that I've ever purchased. It really gives the viewer an up close view of leopards and now I'm fascinated with them."
5,Informative and Entertaining!,"This was a great video! It plays out like a movie. In this particular movie, you follow the life of a mother leopardess as she raises and teaches her cubs. Your dished a fair amount of information as the story progresses. The narration isn't bad. Overall, it's thrilling!Packaging ***** ;3Quality ***** ;3Narration **** :3Presentation ***** ;3I'm buying the Blu-Ray Copy and giving this one away to one of my friends!"
4,OH YES FOR DAPHNE'S,"A beautiful and elegant cookbook with simple recipes that produce restaurant style food. The photography gives you great ways of presenting the food. The book also incorporates a nice selection of wines to compliment the food. One dish that blew my friends away was ""tuna with marsala, peppers and olives"". A definite for all Italian cuisine lovers!"
1,Fell Apart,Lasted less than a month before it started to fall apart on me. The fabric pulled free from the stitching leaving open gaps in the seams.
4,Outstanding!,"This presents a very comprehensive view of Johnson's life and political career. If I find fault, it is the way Johnson's management of the Vietnama War is handled. We are shown how Johnson supposedly backed himself into a corner with the war, but little context is provided. It's seems clear to me the producers were liberal. They make it seem that all Johnson had to do to end the war was recall our military. Simple enough military tactic - not so simple a stategic tactic in the context of the Cold War. In contrast, the producers give considerable context to Johnson's management of civil rights issuses, of course favoring minorities."
5,A wonderful book,"I read this book and want to read it over and over. Its the kind of book that you curl up in your favorite chair with a nice fleese blanket and read infront of a fireplace. It truly captures what it's like in the life of horses. I have had so many innocents and I can really relate. And with horses you have Unconditonal love. They step on your feet, they buck you off, they spook at the littlest things, and you do so much work every day but you wouldnt trade the it for the world. And those inncodents become stories to tell and laugh at. And that is what the book captures. That whole thing. With horses, everyday is interesting, and once you through your leg around that back, your hooked for life"
3,Not What I Thought,This book was cute - but I didn't realize that it was just cartoon drawings with quips under them. I thought it was a collection of stories or something similar. It makes a cute gift idea but definitely not a must have.
4,"Great, laugh out loud","This book is a very funny book. It is especially funny if you have a horse, but still funny if you dont. It makes fun of the things we do wrong, and other care and riding books. GREAT BOOK!!!"
5,wonderful!,"After buying our own copy of this thoroughly enjoyable (and SO true!) book we went ahead and bought three more for our ""horsey"" friends who we knew would enjoy this book as much as we did. It was well worth it with much laughter at these poignant truths depicted in this book in such a comical fashion.A definite must for anyone who has ever been around horses for a marginal amount of time. It's entertainment from the ground up, bound to keep you laughing for hours."
2,Shallow,"Dominick Dunne-level scrutiny should have been accorded to Dominick Dunne. This study is just a series of interviews with Dominick Dunne who is a consummate fiction writer and poseur.Sure, there is a little bit of ""dirt"" provided by his estranged son the film guy Griffin Dunne, and by Joan Didion, his sister in law.However, they were just little sound bites. There is no real analysis. There is not even real interest in getting at the truth of this carefully composed, self-conscious artiste. It's mostly common knowledge that's presented, what anyone who read his Vanity Fair columns would know. Nothing is added by this program.It's a tv movie quality bio pic. It could have been so much more. The true story has not yet been told."
2,Not so good,"I have all the Jason Boland albums, and I am a huge fan. He is by far one of my favorites. However the Bourbon Legend, isnt his best work. It doesnt have the feel the rest of the albums have. I was very disappointed and sold it back after a week of owning it. However I would recommend any of the other albums, he is wonderful live!!"
1,Whoops Jason,"This album is not worth your time. Every song has the same theme as far as the ""music"" goes. Bourbon Legend is a great song but this CD does not compare to Live at Billy Bob's Texas. I was very dissapointed after listening to this album once and immediately sold it back to Amazon. He should stay away from the studio and do what he does best. BE IN THE BAR!!!!!!!"
5,The Art of Virgil Fox Vol. 2,"I find the recording quality of this CD to be very good. As a child I had the opportunity to meet the organist Virgil Fox through my mother, who was a friend and colleague of his (she was the soprano soloist at the Riverside Church where he was organist - the Riverside Church is also the place where the recordings were made). I also heard Mr. Fox live and found him to be a first-class artist. I can recommend the CD without reservation. Alexander Stevenson"
2,Nice pictures,"Nice pictures but the wording is not something I would like to expose my child to, ""You're as ugly as a Pekingese. Your sure ain't no Siamese."""
1,"Don't break the lid, you won't get another","I purchased this item after carefull research to get the best. I broke the lid after a few months use. I sent to the distributor to order a replacement. It took 2 months after repeated correspondence and then the replacement didn't fit. When I wrote to them letting them know that I checked the site and apparently ordered the correct replacement but that it didn't fit, I was told that they stopped making the correct lid due to problems ""exploding"" and that the replacement was too small. I was told that there is no recourse. So, whatever you do, Don't Break the Lid!"
1,I'm getting rid of mine,"Even on the lowest setting (""WARM"") this thing boils and thus eventually burns anything you put in it. I got this as a Christmas Gift last year and I wish I would have used it sooner so I could've returned it. You cannot touch the lid once the unit is hot or you will get burned. (By the way, the lid is glass. How stupid is that?) The outside casing doesn't stay too cool either. I guess for the price you get what you pay for. So, I'm goiong to give mine away."
5,Nice little crock pot,"This is great for stews, curries, or fruit - I've used mine heavily this season for cooking down applesauce and apple butter, and it's behaving beautifully. I could wish for a 'timed off' feature, but in an inexpensive model like this one can't have everything.Taking the other reviewers' comments into consideration, though, I'm being very careful of the lid...!"
5,"Very touching, great for all ages.","This book was given to a friend of mine as a gift. I read it and soon began giving it to others too. It has a very heartwarming story of a group of Lakota people traveling all over to spread the spiritual wisdom of Black Elk's vision. It's fun because you can follow the travellers on a map at the beginning of the book as they go all over the world and celebrate with indigenous people who they find share the same basic ideals as them. I bought a copy for my nephew, and my father as well. Too bad it's out of print, but amazon found me two copies."
5,Great Classics with a New Twist,"This album contains many Christmas favorites masterfully performed by Culbertson, et al. It is definitely a disc that you will keep spinning all season long to promote the cheer. His wife Michelle contributes beautifully on the vocals to ""Some Children See Him."" I have a lot of Christmas albums in my collection, and I honestly have to say that this is one of the best I have yet to come across. This is definitely a compilation that the entire family will love. I highly recommend it to anyone who needs a little pizazz this holiday!"
5,Soulful Christmas Brian Culbertson,"The title said it all, Soulful Christmas is what I expected from Brian. His music is loved by all ages!!!"
3,Buy a larger size.,"They were narrow, like European Shoes. Buy a wider width and a half-size larger. If you have a high instep, do not buy these. They are well made but not for me. I had no trouble returning them. The vendor was fine."
4,replacement grasshoppers,These Grasshoppers are an identical replacement for a pair I have worn to shreds and couldn't bear to part with as they are comfortable and durable and fit well. They were hard to find and I was delighted to find them on Amazon.com. My purchase went smoothly and the order arrived as promised.Roz
3,Fast Delivery - crappy product,Fast delivery - but my wife says the shoes are very poor quality.Worn once and tossed into the trash.Not the seller's fault however - so 5 stars to them and 1 to the mfg. thus 3 stars.
5,These shoes...,"These shoes are the most comfortable shoes I have ever purchased. They are great to wear to work and great to walk in. I am buying more shoes from Grasshoppers, forget Rockport and Easy Spirit."
5,Timely,Product line is favorable...prices fair...I ahd a pair just like this 3 years it lasted...then the inside collapsed at the heal...into the trash they went...was happy to find them again...
5,Jensen Slip on shoes,These are the only shoes my mom can wear comfortably. Great product and good price. Have ordered other colors for her
2,11WW are not wide!,"I purchased these slip ons because I wanted to get my mom a different grasshopper shoe, since she loves them so. Unfortunately, one look at the shoes and they went right back into the box and sent back. My mom has really wide feet, due to a condition that causes her to have high levels of water retention in her legs and feet. If she's on her feet for too long, her feet further swell. These shoes didn't look capable of holding a regular wide foot let alone an extra, extra wide one. Maybe as a regular shoe they're awesome, but if you're looking for a pair to accomodate a wide foot, look elsewhere."
4,very comfortable,They have changed inside of the shoe since the last time I purchased it.It has more padding and is more comfortable. I have worn out several pairs of this style.
4,Keds Slip-On,"I'm pretty satisfied with these shoes. They run true to size and are very comfortable. They had limited colors and I bought ""bone"". The color is all right and I'm was able to wear them when the season changed. They are not made of leather and that's why they lost a star."
3,Devil Cow was funnier.,"I have observed Mr. Brown's comic talents for some time now. I can say that ""Devil Cow and Jelly are friends"" is the best thing he has ever done, if not the single greatest comedic moment of our lifetimes."
2,useless toilet humor,"a second star is given for the two times it made me chuckle. but if you're trying to decide wether to spend your 13 dollars on this book or in the diner down the street on a cheeseburger and a strawberry shake, opt for the cheeseburger.unless you are a fan of fart jokes and toilet humor, which i haven't found funny since the age of 9, don't buy this book. there's simply not much there."
1,"Crass, ugly. Don't spend your hard earned cash on this book.","Yes, it is a parody of ""Who Moved My Cheese"". But buy this book only if you are looking to read juvenile bathroom humor, or worse, humor that is sexist and crass."
1,"Gross, disgusting, and worst of all, NOT FUNNY","I chose this version based on the review that said this is the one you want, and warned that a DIFFERENT one was disgusting and scatalogical. If this is the better one, I'm truly afraid to imagine what the worse one is like.Much of this book is so vile that I would never be willing to type what it says, but here is milder example:""and as the Cheese Depot had no rest rooms, the atmosphere grew progressively more unbearable. Duck and Cover chopped up their cubicles and formed...cleverly concealed trap doors over pits filled with feces-smeared punji stakes. But their excellent defensive measures could not remedy their lack of cheese."""
1,An Insult to Scenic Painting,"This book contains no scenic painting. Every image is made in Photoshop, and not well. A scene painting book should contain real examples of painted work. The educational value of this book is nil. If you want a real text, use the Crabtree book or Lynn Pektal's book. I was excited when this first came out only to be rudely surprised that the author seemed to subtract from the body of knowledge about painting, rather than add. The book is pretty and well produced, but you can't judge a book by it's shiny cover and spiral binding."
1,Really disappointing,"I couldn't agree more with the previous reviewer - there is not one single example of actual scene painting in this book - it's all Photoshop!!The idea of the book is good, the subject of the projects is appropriate for a beginning scenic artist or scenic-art class, the instructions are pretty easy to follow, so why, oh why, didn't the author actually PAINT and photograph the examples rather than Photoshoping them?"
4,"Americana, Blues and a touch of a Soul",There isn't one track on this CD that can't get my toe tapping and envelope me in music! If you are looking for mainstream cookie cutter music this isn't it... The style and energy that emanates from the music is as energizing as dancing in a thunderstorm!
3,"looks nice, for low price",This pistol looks very nice and shoots okay. It feels very nice in the hand. The optional long barrel adds versatility.Remember that this is toward the bottom of the price range for something like this and you should be okay buying it. Hobbytron has proven to be a reliable vender.
3,not that great,"this gun has ok accuracy. at first i liked the ""rifle"" add on that came with it, but soon realized that is was all cosmetic. the add on and the regular barrel are just tubes of plastic that arent even the same size as the bb. the add on's kill your accuracy and you'd be better off just using the rear site on the pistol. i would NOT recommend this."
5,skiwvxc,"The White Grass Cafe Cookbook is one that will travel everywhere with me. The recipes are wonderful and simple to follow. Healthy eating and living is proven easy at White Grass. Anytime I fix something from the cookbook, the smell in our kitchen brings us back to one of our favorite places....White Grass Ski Touring Center and Cafe! Happy Trails!"
5,Highly recommended!,"I saw this when it originally aired on PBS and it made me both angry and sad. Angry that a huge BILLION dollar company cannot afford to give their employees affordable healthcare,put some AMERICAN companies out of business(Rubbermaid)because of their greedy buying tactics and overall have shady business practices. Sad because they have been getting away with this irresponsible behaviour for far to long. People are beginning to wake up and realise how much harm this company is really causing America. If you need to find out information for yourself please buy this film. You will walk away from it never wanting to shop at Walmart ever again."
5,Wal-Mart; Corporate Bully,"A excellent show on what really goes on at Wal-Mart. This company is like a run-away freight train. Really sad that greed could cause so much turmoil in our society. I believe Wal-Marts profits for last year was around 350 billion, yet they keep trying to bully themselves into more cities and towns across America. I love to see former employees of companys like Wal-Mart, blow the whistle on the inside information that you don't get to read about in the news. Maybe someday, somehow this giant gorilla will be brought to its knees."
5,NOT JUST A GREAT COVER!!,"Not only is the art work on the cd really cool, but the music is killer!!. The guitar sound is very crunchy, the bass is like a great rummble, and the drumming is amazing. Matt pike's solos are impecable, and well thought out. This is one of the heaviest new cds' i have heard since sleep's ""holy mountain"",which i recommend also. I saw high on fire live a like a month ago, and they are amazing!! Buy this cd, see them live, and you will be in for a treat."
5,inspired heaviness,"amazing CD. not nearly as good as them live, but that's the breaks. play the CD really, really loud. not sure about the explicit lyrics part tho. weird lyrics, maybe.see them.check out the men of porn, too."
2,mediocre,"i initially liked this album quite a bit, but as a few weeks have passed, the songs reveal themselves to be weak. no real melodies, repetitive. it's dirgy sabbath-like metal, which i always enjoy. if you're tempted to buy this, you should own monster magnet's ""spine of god"" first."
4,"Not the best but holy cow, look at that price","I bought this movie at wal-mart today for 3.95 in Caniaden dollars, so thats must be 50 cents US and its selling for that much. Holy cow"
3,useable,Not the quality that I would expect for the amount of money I spent. Seemed to be thinner material and not as dark as I expected.
3,The Character Of the Doll,"I personally think that the age limit of the doll should be raised and better explained to a child.For one a child may think it's allright to have babies, children of today know more about sex than their parents. It is an educational tool for children male or female of all ages. Should be used mostly for an education factor."
1,I can't believe..,"I can't believe that someone would think to make a ""toy"" like this for our children. While the doll could prove to be somewhat educational, I think that a little more thought could have been put into how we could have made it. I mean of course we need to explain things to our children and most parents don't know how, but everything that I am reading about this ""Happy Family"" talks about the fact that Midge is married and she wears a ring. Well, a lot of people wear rings and that does not mean they are married. And if we are going to promote being married with a ""Happy Family"", the toy should only be offered as a family. A pregnant doll should not be sold by itself giving young children the impression that it(having a child and raising it) can be done alone!!!"
1,Not an educational toy,"First of all, this gets children asking questions at too young an age. My daughter is 3, and the last thing I want her talking about is pregnancy. There is no way they should have a toy like this for little girls. They should be playing pretend, and dressup. Children are innocent and wonderful, and we shoud protect their innocense, especially at such a wonderful age."
1,Pregnant Barbie. Starting to young!!!!!!,"While this toy maybe educational for an older child, it is NOT appropriate for children Barbie playing age. I was appalled that Mattel would produce such a toy. We need to enjoy our children while they are young, marrying Midge and showing her pregnant is making our children grow up to fast. In my opinion this doll was produced in very poor taste. I hope in the future toys are made more age appropriate."
5,Happy Family Midge - great tool to open dialogue,"The Midge doll is a quality toy which also happens to be an excellent trigger for first discussions about babies. The way her infant fits snugly into the detachable belly mimicks real life, and her pregnant belly is proportionate to her body. She also diffuses the notion that women are permanently heavier after a baby, as Midge gets her body back after the baby comes. Aside from the fact that in real life it's not quite that simple to give birth (how I wish!), all the right elements for a child's comprehension are there: she's in a loving, monogamous relationship; she carries the baby in her body; and with her husband is welcoming child #2 to their FAMILY. If only it was this perfect for most American children! Hooray, Mattel, Happy Family Midge is wonderful. Any loving, confident, open parent would find her to be a great toy for their child."
5,I Think It is Great,"I Think that the Happy Family Barbie is great. I mean how many time has a child ask where they came from and u explain ""Mommys Belly"" And they still dont understand. Well now they can learn and have fun at the same time. I think that the sooner a child learns the facts of life the better. I think If we explain to our children early in life than there would be a lot less teenage pregnancy. So in regards to all the bad reviews here is a good one."
1,Another attempt to disguise sex,"This program doesn't deserve a positive rating of any kind.80% of the program was dedicated to marketing techniques and research on the media and their efforts to advertise to the teen market and what the teen market demands from them. The other 20% was dedicated to gratuitous sexual and vulgar footage in the disguise of support for the research done.It is inappropriate and feeds the growing problems of our youth today by supplying them with more images and behavior that has no moral value.The program would have been acceptable for a marketing or research class on the college level IF it didn't have the unnecessary video footage. As it stands right now, it is crude, vulgar and not suitable for any age."
4,"Good, but not great",I purchased this title to show to my senior high school Economics students thinking it would fire up a lot of discussion about how teenagers are manipulated. Instead it elicited yawns and many comments about how the material was dated and didn't apply to them. I'm still deciding whether or not to include it in next year's curriculum.
3,Frontline docs are great,This is another interesting documentary on marketing from the folks at Frontline on PBS. If you are into this check out The Persuaders. This doc simply shows how marketing information is gathered and used to market to young people.
2,"good, but graphic","The info was very good, thought provoking. A true picture of the culture we live in. I feel it could have been less graphic in some of the imagagery. It would of been a real benefit to show this to the youth of our generation. Made for pbs I expected it to be a little more toned down."
2,Please enter a title for your review,"the part about the underground marketing to make Sprite hiphop was interesting but didn't cover the campaign beyond one promotional event so i didn't really learn anything about how successful it was. this film is mostly propaganda for people with no style who think anyone who likes something they don't must be braindead and feel clever telling others ""you only like that because it was marketed to you"". if you're willing to accept the equation that if 1> a product is marketed, and 2> someone buys that product, then 3> that person bought the product because the marketing is so successfully insidious, then you'll enjoy this film. if you require the question of whether marketing makes a product cool (i.e. brainwashes people into liking it) or merely makes people aware of a product which they then make up their own mind about to be addressed you might find a lot of the conclusions the narrator reaches prejudiced."
4,pickachu rocks,"This system is absolutely great!!! It was a gift for a six year old boy, and he just loves it. However, I can only give it 4 stars out of 5 because the controller is a little difficult for small hands. Otherwise I would definitely recommend this system to anyone who loves Pickachu-like we do!!"
1,didn't turn copper or brass color,IMO turned silver color and was not as described. Don't waste your money and get some real silver solder.
3,Price,"Item is too expensive, better buy it at the grocery store. Flavor is great, but not the sellers price. Usualy Kmart, Walmart and Walgreens carry it and many supermarkets too."
5,Five stars for a five star product!,I love the tasteI definately am recomending to friendsI can't understand why these are not advertised as much as the other Ferrero items.
2,Kid's book,"If you like hampsters, then you will enjoy this book. It is about Fluffy, a pet hampster, who lives in a school. Fluffy always pretends that he is something other than a hampster, and that his name is Butch. Several students at the school play with Fluffy every day. Two girls dress Fluffy up in a pink doll outfit. Two other children in the story made a play yard for the Fluffy. Fluffy has a big imagination for a hampster. He pretends to be a policemen, a captain, a Commander, and a spy. A story about a cute little hampster, I would recommend this book to children. It is at a first and second grade level."
5,DVD Please!,"This is not a review since there are plenty here - just another voice who cannot believe this comedy gem in not yet on DVD. C'mon guys, get this thing out!"
4,The Wrong Box,"Good condition, delivered on time. Good experience. The film itself is funny, well written, and very well acted. Of course, you have to be a fan of fairly old English movies and enjoy that sort of humor; that always helps!!"
4,Slapdash British Farce,"This Victorian romp had a lot of promise because it is steeped in some terrific British comic influences. A plot with an Ealing antecedent (""Kind Hearts and Coronets"") with performers from the Goons(Peter Sellers) and Beyond the Fringe(Peter Cook and Dudley Moore) with Michael Caine playing straightman to all the tomfoolery going on around him. Somehow, though, it doesn't completely hang together. The laughs aren't as rat-a-tat-tat as they should be and the humor isn't as dark as it could be. I couldn't help but wonder if someone other than Bryan Forbes(""Seance on a Wet Afternoon"") say the Boultings or Richard Lester directed that the film's full potential could have been realized. Nonetheless, standouts here are Ralph Richardson, Cook, and Sellers. I give this film a marginal recommendation. It's not a bad film if your expectations weren't as high as mine."
5,TOO GOOD FOR DVD?,"I am glad to see the universal appreciation expressed in all the preceding reviews. This is a wonderful film and good for the whole family. I have enjoyed it for years and may have to replace my own copy in the not so distant future. It is a great gift to give and an even better gift to receive. Unfortunately, it is available only on VHS. Still, it is very much worth having and enjoying - over and over again."
5,"""The Wrong Box"" is the Right Movie","This hilarious video is just like the clean Monty Python movie we have all been waiting for. Unlike most British humor, ""The Wrong Box"" is a movie with a cheerful, relaxing plot and is full of wit. My family highly recomends this movie to anyone who wants to have a good laugh."
4,classic comedy/ late Victorian period piece,"This film is driven, as all great comedy is, by the conflicts among the delightful collection of off-the-wall characters. Peter Sellers's scenes as the cat-infested Dr Pratt are superb. The nasty young Finsbury with his collection of hundreds of eggs made me want to find my textbook on abnormal psychology. The elderly Finsbury (I would enjoy him as a sort of great-uncle, provided I only had to see him at Christmas) who collects the most useless information known to man was a real hoot. I enjoyed watching Nanette Newman as the dotty and sweet Julia Finsbury float about in ankle-length lace and satin gowns while she tried not to think about how hot the sight of bare male forearms (For shame!) makes her. Try to imagine a less manic version of a Monty Python film and you will have the feel of this fun old movie."
1,JUST PLAIN SILLY,I read the cast list and thought this has to be good well was i wrong.The movie is plain silly and yes maybe there are some redeeming features but i couldn't even finish it.Not my cup of tea.Picture and sound are good.
3,The Wrong Box ticks the right box,"The quality and expectations were very good. I was really surprised by the quality of this product, and the expectations of a black humoured comedy from the 1960's was happily met."
5,"One of the least known, funniest movies made","This British movie is one of the funniest most timeless movies I've ever seen. I had to buy it so my kids could see it. Staring a young Michael Cain, Dudley Moore, Peter Cook, Sir Ralph Richardson, John Mill, and some other unforgettable characters, it is a complex comic farce."
5,They have got to release this on DVD.,Watched this on TV awhile back. Funniest movie I ever did see. But it's not on DVD. :(
3,kind of disappointing,"Plastic case is pretty flimsy, and there are no inserts (you know, reading material) inside whatsoever.Definitely NOT a complete collection, as others here have said.Yeah I bought it anyway, because I liked the box, and it looks cool on my shelf, but that's about it...."
4,"Not bad, depending on what you pay","I don't get the price fluctuation here--when I bought this thing a few weeks ago it was $17.99 new, and really, that was a good price for it. It comes with the first two flicks plus a blu-ray, so add a really nifty box and I thought it was a bargain. I definitely wouldn't pay anywhere near $45 for it though. It was a birthday present for someone who only likes the first two movies anyway, so that worked out great. I do think it's a little odd that it comes with the first movie, second movie, and then a blu-ray of the first movie. What a strange combination. Why not just the two films? Or why not the two films and a novelty, like a small trinket or figurine? Either way, for less than twenty bucks this is a purchase I definitely don't regret."
2,YOU DO NOT GET THE WHOLE COLLECTION OF FILMS,"Not the complete collection, only Hellraiser 1 (1x DVD and 1x bluray) and Hellraiser 2 (1x DVD), so not really a collectors box set of all the films. The actual box is cheap plastic but looks ok. Keep your hard earned cash and just buy the films separately if you really want all of them."
1,What?!,"Usually a ""box set"" has ALL the movies in the series...so what the hell is this? I thought they were finally releasing the complete collection but no...I guess that would make too much sense. The only positive thing I can see about this disappointment is the cool packaging. What a wasted opportunity."
4,really?,I really don't see why everyone is complaining about not having all the hellraiser dvd's in this box set...... all the movies after the first 2 suck balls anyways
1,WHY BOTHER?,I thought this box set would come with everyHellraiser film but I thought wrong.It's only gonna have the anniversary edition'sof Hellraiser and Hellraiser 2 which I already have.To me it's pointless because you can buy both thosedvd's under $20 each here on amazon.Anchor Bay does not know what the fans want.It is a cool looking box but why bother?It is a waste of money if you ask me.
2,Did not recieve all of it,"Hellraiser: Boxed SetWhen placing the order I was under the impression that would get the whole thing but when it came all I got was the movies. I never got the box that was suppose to be part of the order. It's a good thing that this was not a gift otherwise I would have been even more disappointed.So when you order something be sure you are gettng all of it not just part.... The movies themselves came in excellant condition and for that I will give them 5 stars.*****yours truley. Mr, disappointed."
2,"nifty box, dumb boxed set","A spruced-up, good-looking edition of the horror gem starring Pinhead. Lots of extras. It's $15 more than the standard DVD, which isn't a surprise since the movie came out in 1987. Major fans already have the first two Hellraisers, so would they want to pay $59.97 for the boxed set? It comes in a very nifty design that mimics a prop in the movie. But it also contains a complete Hellraiser 1 and 2 on DVD and then Hellraiser again on BluRay. Lots of BuRays also contain a standard DVD, but not often in an entirely new case. Any fan would already have the first two so they're spending an extra $30 just to get the case, assuming they have BluRay. It's a headscratcher. Visit me online at michaelgiltz dot com."
4,a gift for my inner nerd.,"This was definiately an Impulse buy. I could have got the movies seperately for cheaper, but i have always wanted a puzzle box in one form or another and then I seen this.It came well protected in its retail packaging, but the box leaves something to be desired. Made of a cheap lightweight plastic it is noticably lighter than it looks. It gives off the impression that you can rotate the halves of the boxes and in essence ""play"" with the box, but that is not the case, as the halves only fit together in one way. When put together, the fingers of the box halves have nothing to be supported against at the tip and will flex inward.The movie quality is as others described it, and makes for an enjoyable experience.In all i'm still happy with the purchase, although I'll probably put the discs into a binder and add some weights to the box and glue it shut, to use as a paperweight of sorts."
1,Woul give 0 stars if possible,"Buyer Beware...I was looking forward to giving the doll described and pictured on this website as a gift, but when it arrived it was NOT at all as pictured or described on the website. I contacted customer service who assured me that they would fix the problem, but when they sent me a replacement, it was the same wrong doll. I, then, contacted customer service again and was told that they couldn't do anything to fix the problem."
4,What Do You Think?,Loved the idea of short stories; can read for short periods of time if choose.Stories are very touching; really related to the stories.They do touch all realms of emotions.
4,Brilliant,"Dr. Carroll exposes the truth of the French Revolution as the evil monster it was. The Revolution was truly satanic. The book is very well researched and cited. I gave it only four stars because I found some grammatical mistakes that drove me crazy and because I would have liked some more background information. However, it is a very good book. A must read for any student of European history."
2,"Poor Quality, Overpriced",Large number of classics but not worth $30. Picture and sound quality very por. Do not recommend. I gave my away.
5,A great Film Noir set!,I really enjoyed every movie in this set. It's a great selection of Film Noir and definitely has a little something for everyone.
2,Not for pedestal sinks,The faucet itself is fine. The attached supply lines are not suitable for pedestal sinks where standard chrome supply lines look better.The lines are very long and cannot be shortened as well as black so they stick out next to everything else under a sink which tends to be chrome.
1,Caution: This book is bias and one author is a fired professor.,"If you believe everything you read, you should not read this book. Look into the background of Ward Churchill and decide if he is a person who is fair and balanced when it comes to his version of events."
5,Very interesting book.,I love books in general (usually good for an extra star). This is an interesting book. I enjoyed reading it. Not everyone will.
2,As the worm turns,"I am sure some of the stories told by this author are true. However, his ""path to redemption"" seems just a bit far fetched. If he could lie with a very straight face to the FBI to save his pension, who is to say, that he is now telling the ""truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth"" now that book royalties are involved. His flip flopping loyalties continue to amaze me, and that does not even get to the strange logic he employs to reach each shifting conclusion."
5,Unknown Treasure of the West and Indian Culture,"A refreshingly open and objective look at the Apache culture before the reservations. Cremony wrote the first dictionary of the Apache language and earned their grudging respect. He shows admiration for their amazing courage, endurance, and skills of warfare and survival. But, since this was written a century before the political correctness Victorianism we now are censored by, Cremony is able to share his concerns about their interesting work ethic (it is dishonorable for a man to work besides hunting and stealing) and their cruelty. Cremony makes some polite comments about the extreme attractiveness of some of the Apache women which suggests, at a minimum, an emotional involvement -- which adds a touching romantic side to this well written account."
5,"Fascinating, real life account of a rugged life.","This book sat on a dresser for years before I read it. Big mistake--it deserved to be read right away. All the wild episodes of the old cowboy and Indian movies are here, except they are real.Cremony demonstrates the prejudices of 19th Century White Americans, of course, but the realities of Apache as well as White behavior come through clearly, and the people who move through the story are more absorbing than many a best seller's characters. In the course of all this adventure, Cremony manages to shed considerable light both on history and human nature. It is truly a shame that this fascinating autobiography will be read by so few people"
4,A Mixture of Fact & Fiction,"Cremony's book inspired many a Hollywood screenwriter, and for years his words have been taken as gospel. As a writer who lives in the Southwest, I have visited some of the important locations and began to doubt his veracity. Scholars have since shown that Cremony was habitually inflating his own importance and his knowledge of Apache ways and history. Of particular note are his highly fictionalized accounts of the life of Mangas Coloradas -- a man far more important to history than Cremony. But this work remains an extremely telling document of a time and place -- and all the strange attitudes that made up ""white"" perceptions."
2,"Starts With a Bang, Ends With A Whimper","This 1989 collection kicks off with two fabulous R&B/dance grooves that smoke like nobody's business in Soul II Soul's ""Back to Life,"" and Fine Young Cannibals' ""She Drives Me Crazy."" From there things begin to fall apart pretty alarmingly although they do perk up a bit with ""So Alive"" by Love and Rockets (and one is tempted to give the collection credit for adding the utterly surreal cover of Prince's ""Kiss"" by The Art of Noise and Tom Jones) but by then it is too little too late and the collection, which could have benefited from 1989 songs like Tom Petty's ""Free Fallin,"" The B-52's ""Love Shack,"" or Simply Red's cover of Harold Melvin and the Bluenotes's ""If You Don't Know Me By Now"" (top ten hits all) sinks under the weight of too much filler. Oh well, at least they didn't include any Milli Vanilli."
5,A True Miracle Story,This is a great book to read for anyone who thinks that something can't be done. This is the true story about Adam Taliaferro a Penn State football player who breaks his neck in a football game against Ohio State. The book is an emotional read but a good one. This read will make you shed a tear and also make you cheer when your done reading it. A good book for anyone who is a Penn State fan as well.
5,An Inspirational Story,"The book ""Miracle in the Making"" is an inspirational story about Adam Taliaferro, a former Penn State football player who was paralyzed in a game. He was told he would never walk again and this books lets you travel with Adam in his personal story of his road back after being completely paralyzed. This boo is a truly motivational book in which i recommend anyone, not just Penn State fans, to read."
5,Unrivaled,"I own shelves of books on Asperger Syndrome and this one is by far the best. I've owned it for years and return to it often when difficult situations arise. It's thorough, comprehensive and helpful beyond measure. It should be noted that its primary focus is newly diagnosed younger to tween children, however the authors have numerous other books available that are comparably good."
3,Good info,"Helped with information regarding dx, other social skills, role playingwill forward to my daughters teachers to help guide her"
5,A Parent's guide to Asperger Syndrome and High Functioning Autism,Excellent book. Gives insight for all different levels of the syndrome. Lots of good real life examples and stories. Good reference book to have on hand.
4,Oldies,A decent selection of music from 1971. I picked it for 5 or 6 of the songs I really liked because they would be on the same CD.
3,Not as good as the Offensive Soccer Tactics,"I was very pleased with the Offensive Soccer Tactics and decided to buy the Defensive Soccer Tactics by the same authors.I found the Defensive Tactics (was actually published 2 years before the Offensive Tactics) to be a bit sloppy. Maybe it's the translation. However many of the drills are just not convincing me enough to take them to the practice field; either too cumbersome or hard to see the application to the game. They are all written in running sentences; no points or bullets are used.Here is a simple drill:""Player 1 passes to 2, after which 1 overtakes 2, who waits for 1 and turns to dribble past 1 (See figure 2.3). Once 2 gets a short distance past 1, player 2 turns and passes back to 1. Player 1 plays 2, and so on.""The same writing style exists in the Offensive Tactics book but at least I found the drills to be more applicable and easier to apply."
2,Mediocre,"This book though well-intentioned, ended up being mediocre at best. The ""translation"" is awful, the exposition poor and the browsing back and forth looking for figures cited in the text is rather cumbersome. There is a void (of books) in this genra and in defense skills in specific. Some of them are geared towards the hard-core pro/semi-pro, then there's a huge gap in the middle, and then there are books geared towards the beginners and ""dummies."" Those of us who love to play and watch this sport find ourselves at a loss when it comes to good self-coaching/game improvement literature. This book, as said above, is not one I would recommend to someone fitting that ""intermediate"" level."
3,Studio is better,"The CD quality is good, physically speaking. I got my money's worth.3 Doors down are a great band in Studio, but like most other bands in live they don't sound as good. The live version is O.K., but not outstanding. Whatever happened to those early 70's bands that sounded live as good or better than studio? Overdubbings really kill a band.-Z"
2,Again disappointed,The quality of this CD is very poor. I gave it away and then went and purchased it somewhere else. Again the mixing is very poor and I would not recommend to anyone.
4,Misunderstood Movie,"Personally, I loved this movie. It may have been because I had no preconceived notion that it was supposed to be like Creul Intentions, having watched it on HBO and without any idea of what I was watching. I hate to be cliche, but you really cannot judge this movie by the cover. It's deceptively packaged as being a typical teen movie when in reality it is a deeply disturbing movie about a girl's life being destroyed as she tries to figure out who she is. Although some characters are a bit overacted they convicingly pull you into their deceptive lives. Tart exposes the world of friends having falsified identities and a seemingly glamourous life."
1,Gag me with a coke spoon!,"This movie was terrible! the writing was atrocious and cliched, the character development non-existant, and the ending so vomit inducing it could have been ipecac."
4,A LOOK AT LIFE IN THE REAL WORLD!,"THIS MOVIE SHOWS US A REALISTIC LOOK AT THE HATES OF SOCIETY AND WHAT IT'S LIKE FOR US TO FIT IN.DOMINIQUE SWAIN PORTRAYS THE MAIN CHARACTER IN THIS FILM WITH CHARM AND SOPHISTICATION. AS BEAUTIFUL AS I HAVE EVER SEEN HER, SHE SHINES IN THIS FILM.THE SUBJECT MATTER IS GEARED TOWARDS TEENS, BUT IT HAS A POSITIVE MESSAGE BEHIND IT. IT IS AS FOLLOWS:SOMETIMES IT TAKES A WHILE TO REALIZE WHO OUR TRUE FRIENDS ARE.I HOLD DOMINIQUE SWAIN IN HIGH REGARD AS MY FAVORITE ACTRESS AND THE MOST BEAUTIFUL GIRL IN MOVIES TODAY!ASIDE FROM THAT, THIS IS A LOOK AT LIFE IN THE REAL WORLD!"
2,"A ""Tart"" of a movie.","This is an OK movie, but it could have been a lot better. I watched this movie because I am a fan of Brad Renfro and Dominique Swain. Renfro's acting is quite good as usual in Tart and he is very believable in his role as a popular but troubled teenager. Dominique Swain however is mediocre and doesn't display her true acting talents. Melanie Griffith is credited on the movie case, but her total screen time is merely 20secs(I'm not kidding!).Tart is a movie that is targeted for the same audience as movies such as 'Cruel Intentions'.The DVD lacks any extra features (except for a 3min trailer).Rent the movie from a video store before you choose to buy it."
1,good cast that goes nowhear,"tart is a poorly writen movie that is a waste of some of the best young actors. the script gives us no reason to like anyone in this film, making it an endurence test to watch it all the way through. swain who was interisting in lolita is just nothing here, phillips, who is entertaining usually, is just a paper cut out of a person. and mischa barton, who has always held my attention when on screen, even in bad, poorly written movies, couldn't even hold my interest in this film"
2,I was warned. I watched it anyway.,"The only thing that kept this movie afloat was Miss Swain's beauty. I never get tired of looking at her. But the acting and characters in this movie were atrocious. Robots are seen instead of characters with depth -- it's so hard to develop any feelings for these people. And you know what that leads to...you cheer for their demise. (Like in that other Dominique Swain movie - The Smokers.) In a movie with little substance, you have to flaunt what you got, thus Melanie Griffith's name headlines with the others even though she only makes a 7 second cameo! So, I give this movie one star for existing and one star for Swain's pretty face."
4,A good young cast,"This movie is better than it sounds. It's about rich kids, gone bad. Swain, whom I normally dont like, is actually good in the movie. If you liked Igby Down Under, you'll like this."
3,Is it really that bad?,"As I was flipping through channels on HBO, I came across the last 20-30 minutes of Tart. From what I saw, it seemed like an interesting movie. I'd like to see it from the beginning. But from the way everyone is battering it maybe I won't. Perhaps I had to see it from the beginning to appreciate how bad most of you are saying it is. Since I haven't seen the whole thing, I can't rate it (i gave it 3 stars because I my computer made me put something), but from what I saw, it didn't seem terrible, but rather interesting. I might just rent it since I usually like movies starring Dominique Swain."
2,"Visually interesting, OK, true.","As far as acting, story line, directing, casting, and sexiness, it's a dud. Another ultra-hyped mediocrity. Enjoyable to a degree for just how incomprehensible it is."
2,had some potenial,A quick review of the movie the main actor is a peeping tom who watches women undress etc He hooks up with a girlfriend and watches her with other guys. Some potenial moments only to spoiled by a coy camerman still the movie was made in 1967. Some partial nudity and some sexy moments. but on the whole a bit tame by todays standard but still worth a look.
2,A Glorified Walkie Talkie.,"My girls had been begging for cell phones but I just couldn't make myself do that. After seeing these on tv they decided this was the next best thing. It is difficult to get this to work...After playing with them for 3 days we still have not figured out the ""call"" or text message features. You can ""chat"" all day because that is the walkie-talkie part of it...just push the button and speak. The camera function is very disappointing. You can see a black outline on a very dark gray screen that somewhat resembles the picture you took. I, as a parent, was very disappointed...My 7 and 10 year old think they are okay but are not totally thrilled...I'm counting the minutes to when these end up in the bottom of the toy box and the requests for a REAL cell phone begin again. :)"
3,Cell phone or walkie talkie?,"Okay let me start by saying that my 3 1/2 year old son has played with these more than my 5 1/2 year old daughter. They were and still are hard to figure out. When in phone mode, you can barely hear the ring and you still have to push in the button to talk, just like in walkie talkie mode. I bought these for my daughter who really wants a cell phone, but I think she is too young. I figured these were a good alternative. I was hoping she could take one to Grandma's who just lives down the street, but I don't see these getting much use out of the house if even then. Although my son enjoys the walkie talkie mode, I am very disappointed with these. I didn't expect much, but I expected them to work as advertised. Maybe I'll have to reconsider the cell phone..."
4,This is very nice!,"This is a really nice toy! However, it looks like a huge cellphone so don't ever think about a lot of people mistakening it for a cellphone. Here are some things about it:Pros1. you can call2. you can text message (it also has pictures)3. The pictures are fun to take.4. You can personalize and animatize a lot of things.Cons1. The pictures are kind of fuzzy (you can make the contrast greater and it's clearer)2. you can only call people with chat nows. And, also it has to be within two miles (not counting road blockers(houses, trees, floors, ect).3. you can only text or call when someone has their chatnow on.On the whole, I think this toy is really fun."
1,waste of money,"My daughter begged me for this item. It's a bit pricey so I made her wait for her birthday. What a waste of my hard earned money. The pictures are so poor that you cannot tell what you took a picture of -very dark and grainy even when taken outside on a bright sunny day. After the first day of purchase, my daughters no longer play with them. They use them as chairs for their Barbies."
4,it's a hunk,This item is ok. I haven't totally tried it out yet but I can tell all you kids who think this is like a real cellphone that they are totally wrong. This is a hunky walkie talkie and I mean hunky. It's huge (about the size of your hand and the width is about the size of your pointer finger spread across it.Don't get the idea people are ever going to mistaken that thing for a cellphone! It looks like how a cellphone might of looked like in the stone ages!p.s it is fun to decorate though :)
3,Good features but volume needs tweaking,"I bought this product for my kids this past Christmas and I really like the ease of use and the features. They really enjoyed the ability to text message each other and the range was good.There are two things that I did not like. First, the volume is so low that unless you are holding it in your hand it is impossible to hear someone trying to contact you. Secondly, the screen is not backlit so if you're in a darkened room you cannot read it - and forget about night time usage. Because of these problems I felt that the product was over priced."
3,"Oh, dear. . .","I have to admit, I've been a big fan of Remnants for about seven months now, and I stood by after Lost and Found, and whole Dreamstorm was better, Aftermath sunk back to 3 star level.If you're a fan you should definitely read this one. Remnants is one of those series where you'll be completely lost if you don't read them in order. Otherwise, just don't.Some good things about it is that Billy is not dead. The ending was good, and we have a cliffhanger ending. I don't understand why Echo's on the cover. She only made a 10 page appearance and has very little relevance to the story.At any rate there was little story. But it ahd a message. The Remnants taught the Marauders to be human again. Survival does bad things to your humanity.But never fear, I have a strong feeling the next book will be REALLY great. The sample was, anyway.To KA: Great work! keep it coming!"
3,still not enough gore,"I guess this movie is okay by low standards.It has some sexual torture,some chainsaw torture and some funny torture.It's not enough for a good movie,though.Watch it with friends and beer and get some laughs out of it."
4,Crazy!,"I think this film is worth watching. Definitely not for the faint of heart, and some people may even find it arousing. But it is a film about torture in one of the worst possible way. Got me a little weak myself."
1,Blood & yawn,This movie had the potential to be grotesque but unfortunately didn't quite cut it with the special effects. It had some mildly erotic moments but just didn't make it as a horror movie. If the actors had been Muppets in stead it could have been a killer comedy.
3,"Pretty, but not a good match.","I bought this vanity light expecting it to match the Moen oil-rubbed bronze fixtures we have in our bathroom. I was really disappointed to find that it was much redder than the fixtures and not a very good match at all. In and of itself it's a very pretty light, but as a match to the Moen ORB...not so much."
3,good sheets,these are so so sheets. they feel very rough even after a couple of washes... do not with anything else! the red does run allot
2,Not as soft as we wanted,Sometimes you get what you pay for....... Have washed several times and still rough and stiff. Will try another brand next time.
1,Poor stitching; poor sizing!,"These sheets were disappointing as was the quality. I compare them to sheets I've purchased at closeouts. The stitching was irregular and stood out because white thread was used on the orange sheet. Also, the fitted sheet did not fit our full size bed. The pockets weren't deep enough (our mattress was average depth and size) and I had to pull and tug daily to get the sheet back over one of the corners of the mattress. I've since gotten a new fitted sheet through ebay and will not purchase fitted sheets through Amazon again."
1,Do you like sandpaper against your skin?,"Ugh! These sheets are awful! If you like the feeling of sandpaper against your skin then you might like them. They are rough and prickly. I tried washing them 5 times in one day to get them to ""soften"" up....but they never did. If you have sensitive skin like me; do NOT buy these sheets."
3,Not Good,Please do not buy this sheet set.The cloth is very rough and we have not used it more than couple of times. Its a waste of money.
1,Terrible Sheets,"Did not fit well, baggy and loose, stitching very poor, uncut threads, elastic probably will not last through very many washings, color shown was a light pale yellow, color received is so bright they look cheaper than they are. Very disappointed."
2,Sheet Set Review,"Sheets today are made with a high thread count and we find them way too soft and wrinkly. I bought these sheets thinking they would be better because the thread count is low, but they feel very ""bumpy"" and feel coarse and they aren't very nice to sleep on!"
3,Sheet Set,"I am very pleased with the sheet set, my main interest was that they wouldn't wrinkle bad which they don't. Thank you."
4,Patrician Solid 250 Count Black Sheets,I am quite happy with the black sheets that I purchased from Amazon.com.They are soft and wash well.I would definitely purchase them at a future point in time.
3,The first of the Lensman books....,"....and adventuresome, fast-paced, a romp, a space opera classic, and marred throughout by Smith's ham-handed addiction to dramatic adjectives and cheesy expostulations. These were fun to read when I was a boy. Then I grew up."
3,A bit Dull,"The series was good not great (a solid B). I enjoyed the Super Hero concept of the Lensman, but I did not find the story very interesting and it went on and on. I kept waiting for something (anything) to get resolved. For most of the story I was very conscious that I was reading. I had to push myself just to get through it. It was better after I was finished. It is the kind of series that a die-hard SF fan has to read once. But I could not in good conscience recommend the series to a friend."
3,I have one problem...,"All of the heroes are white. Not only white but Aryan and that seems to make them better than all other races everywhere in the Galaxy!Fighting past that and the grade school dialogue, the stories are fast paced and quite enjoyable. It is pure pulp fiction and at times you almost have to stop reading to catch your breath. Its ok that the science isnt perfect, you have to excuse these things reading a book that's over 50 years old, and my only problems are the blatant racism and sexism that pervade throughout the series. Without those problems I would have given it 5 stars."
1,False advertising - not the real Lensman story!,"Contrary to what you may be expecting, this book does not contain the full text of the first installment of Dr. Smith's Lensman series.What it does contain is a short story which was later folded into the first installment of the series. If you're looking to get into the Lensman series, find an edition which contains the proper material."
5,BAD JOHN AND BENJAMIN SCOTT ARE LIARS,"The first words i read after opening this version of triplanetary were book one, dawn, arisia and eddore. this is connected to lensman, and i am more than excited to get started!"
1,"Rating the Cosmos Books; Reprint edition, not the work","The ""Cosmos Books; Reprint edition"" is not the same as any previous release I've owned. It opens with the Rodger the Space Private story and does not include any of the Arisia/Eddore series setup material. No Atlantis, no Rome, no WWI, II, or III.Oddly the back cover suggests that all that material is included. Half the page count is some obscure Smith yarn called ""Masters of Space"".Since I particularly like the early saga pieces, I am really ticked off."
2,Not Kindle Ready,"This is a review of the $3.69 Kindle Edition of Triplanetary. Be warned that all of the kindle versions of this book that Amazon currently offers are the original magazine version of the story and lack all reference to the Lensman series. Those elements were later added by Doc Smith in the 1940s for republication and seem to only be included in some of the physical book editions. The Kindle version does not have the first section containing the backstory of the Arisians and the Eddorians; does not include the fall of Atlantis nor of Rome, and does not include the world war(s). It begins with the space pirates in what would later be the third section of the book. I bought this for the Kindle expecting the final version of the book and feel I got burned because 1/3rd of the book was missing. A good yarn, but not yet part of the Lensman series."
4,"Lensman Series, Book 1","I wanted to read this book as I recently read a review on the Star Wars movies that stated this series was a basis for the Jedi Knights. In the end I enjoyed this book, but I found it slow in the begining although this is somewhat necessary as it provides the backdrop for the later books in the Lensman series.E. E. Smith does a good job of using actual history (Rome, World War I,World War II), legend (Atlantis) a fictional basis for the universe and time as a whole. While written 60 years ago, the terminology/technology is not terribly out of date by today's standard of writing and science fiction in general. Looking at the other reviews Phyed-rautha says it very well.I am not an avid reader (maybe a book every other month) and the fact I had difficulty putting it down leads to my high rating. I lower the rating (from 5 stars) due to the slow start."
4,Triplanetary,"I read the Lensman Series many, many years ago. This was the first book I selected to read on my new Kindle. I wish all the books in the Lensman series were ebooks."
4,Lensman,the first in the Lensman series. Too bad the others are not available for ebook although you get hard copy
4,Triplanetary,"Classic 50's science fiction but still a ripping good yarn. The technology referenced is pre-computer and printed circuit so the references to vacuum tubes and radio waves will be foreign to younger readers.It works very well as an introduction to the Lensman series, with many hints at what is to be developed in the later books. I read it when I was very much younger and it hasn't lost it's appeal for me."
5,Seminal series that influenced all subsequent SF. A Prereq!,"Many great writers took inspiration from this series and many more readers cut their philisophical teeth on it. It may have influenced my world view more than any other single item when I first read it at age 11, and it certainly opened up the worlds of great ideas and noble investigation of the rest of the genre to me. I recommend that you read the series (even though it is a little dated and melodramatic by today's standards), AND that you use it to introduce children ages 11 and above to the joys of the genre."
3,Super Reader,"The introductory novel in the Lensman series is not that great, and perhaps is almost an afterthought prequel. It introduces the overarching conflict between the Arisians and the Eddorians, and jumps through ages of human history, including Atlantis, until getting to the current setting.The Arisians have started programs to breed fine warriors on many planets, through subtle manipulation.At the end of this prequel, the Galactic Patrol is formed, flight between stars is possible, and the First Lensman is given his Lens. The Lens is a jewelled band that gives the wearer great mental and enhanced physical powers. Only those in the Arisian breeding line are capable of wielding it, and becoming superhuman. This applies on any planet."
1,"Fun idea, awful writing","I like the basic plot, but the writing is so awful! The sentence structure is often so awful, I had to re-read to figure out what the author was trying to say."
1,Where's the rest of the book?,"As stated by Bad John, This is not the complete book of Triplanetary.The essential initial elements of the series are not present, the clash of galaxies, etc. These elements set the ground for the mythos of the Lensman, and is a magnificent lead-in to this grand psace opera.Try to find the orignal story format for Triplanetary, or you lose so much in this saga.Additionally, if anyone knows where I can obtain a real copy of Triplanetary then please let me know as mine has virtually worn to extinction."
5,Mandatory reading for science fiction fans,"Simply stunning. While many will feel the dialogue is old-fashion, bear in mind the era in which it was written. The astute will recognize the origins of a certain collection of ""knights"" that wave around flashy light sabres. Even Lucas acknowledges that the Lensmen were an inspiration for his Jedi Knights. This is the original stuff, and its wonderful, imaginative, and never ever dull."
2,"great idea, garbage sci-fi","You can't fault E.E. Doc Smith for lack of ambition -- imagining a sci-fi adventure spanning practically the whole universe and continuing for millions of years. But that's about the only compliment I can give this book. As much as I wanted to see how the overarching story played out, I couldn't stomach more than 200 pages of Smith's horrendous dialogue and 1-dimensional cartoon-hero characters."
3,A Mixed Review,"This is Doc Smith's first in the Lensman cycle. Due to the nature of the construction of the text, it is impossible to fully flesh out any of the main characters besides an occasional gushing of emotion or venting of rage. This seriously detracts from this text, and thus I believe that the ""history"" Smith presents might have been better served by being more detailed over the course of portions in several books, or, more for the good, dealt with in several additional books all on their own. It's a shame that Doc didn't have the chance to do this."
3,"Oh, no! My cats don't like this!","After seeing the reviews here and elsewhere on the Web, I thought I just had to get this for my cats. I set it up and would bring it out every day for about a week when I got home from work. At first, my cats (ages about 3 and 6) were curious about it, and sniffed it, etc., but they never played with it. After that, they just sat about 3 feet away and looked at it without interest. I was so disappointed! I ended up giving it to someone with two kittens.I kind of feel bad writing a negative review, but I wanted to give a heads-up that maybe not all cats will like this."
3,"My cat loves this toy, but...","My cat absolutely loves this toy. My favorite feature of the product is the 15 minute timer. It seems like the perfect amount of time for my cat's attention span. The downside of this product is she has broken 3 of them. While they DO stay standing 95% of the time, they do not seem to be able to take the force of a cat who loves this toy. Not only that, but the most recent one I purchased didn't randomly switch direction, which I noticed held my cats attention better. All in all I am a fan, but due to the price I can't justify continuing to purchase it when she's gone through 3 of them in the past year or so. If it were a more sturdy toy that didn't break so easily, it would be the perfect cat toy, in my opinion."
3,they love it...,"My new kitten loves it and has already killed it, after two days of use she has already broken the cheep plastic wand that the feather is attached to. Making it a useless feather toy already that just doesn't hold up to good old kitten play. Maybe this is just the defective one out of the bunch but it was a high priced toy for such little use. I could give it 5 stars for the fun she gout out of it, but not for just two days of fun. And 15 minutes each time at that."
2,Cats Not Loving It!,"This was recently purchased for Christmas but my cats showed virtually no interest in it so it's going in the pile to be donated. I really thought they would like it but that just didn't happen. Oh well, perhaps by donating it some other cats may find it amusing."
1,Junk,The cat broke the gear drive in less than a week. It is a cheap plastic gear drive that won't last. Not worth the purchase price.
5,Natural Medicine,Bought this book for a family member and they really like it. They said it was very informational. It allowed him to see what foods and products he could not eat or buy to lower and/or prevent prostate problems. Its a very small book like it can fit in your pocket.
5,Loving Napoleon,I haven't read the book yet. Oh wait.... maybe I have. I can't remember. I love all these mysteries and who cares if I can't remember which ones I've read & which ones remain to be read??? Go for it - mysteryophiles!!!
3,i buy this thinkin was better than the other italian factory,"but it`s exactly the same or almost , seems to me this looks like the color is fade, i mean some of the color is missing does`nt look like an original part obviously this is not but more quality of this always is expected.... try to improve it"
1,Just Awful,"Grandma gave us this video and my sons just hated it. There is no coherent organization at all to the footage - the narrators just race frantically around a space museum from a space simulator to a saturn 5 rocket to whatever else is nearby. The museum exibits offer no action of their own, so the narrators had to contrive some. And as for the narrators Dave and Becky... they seem to be in competition as to who can ham it up more on camera, which was enough to drive every adult out of the room. Not educational, not entertaining, but plenty annoying. Save your money."
2,Too much talk and not enough action,"I bought this video hoping that it would be similar to Stage Fright Production's videos, e.g., Choo Choo Trains Up Close and Very Personal. My children love that video. Unfortunately, There Goes A Spaceship lacks everything that makes the Choo Choo train video successful. In Spaceship, the NASA footage was excellent. There was simply too little of it. The hosts of Spaceship spend too much time in front of the camera. I doubt anybody, at any age, would find their skits or jokes funny or interesting. Every time one of them came on, my son turned to me and said ""See rocket? See shuttle?"" Don't waste your money on this one."
2,Boring ang gloomy-doomy,"This certainly isn't one of the better TNG books I've read. I'm not sure if it's the author I don't like or just the story. If you like gloomy stories, than read it. Otherwise, you might want to skip it and go on to TNG #7 (Masks)."
2,Trek novels shouldn't be soapboxes,"Weinstein is a good writer, and a good Trek writer. Covenant of the Crown, his first, was a good book. But since then, he's just used Star Trek as a medium for environmentalism. I know the late 80s were filled with ""Save the Earth"" propaganda, but I don't like to read that in my Trek.I won't go on, but I can't recommend this except to Trek book completists (like me)."
2,Not what I expected,"While the selections in this collection are great, the musical arrangements are not the best in terms of soothing a baby to sleep. Some of the selections have upbeat sections or actually increase in volume. I found myself running into the room to lower the volume of the CD player multiple times. My baby stirs out of a relaxing moment in the middle of some of the songs. I still have yet to find the perfect compilation of classical lullabies."
4,"Not bad, dude. Not bad.","Set Your Goals gets me all happy. I like how they got that old punk/hardcore feel but with great melodies so it's nice and easy on the ears. I like all the tracks, but I really like Latch Key. I think that one kind of stands out. But yeah if you see this cd you should totally pick it up, but you probably won't cause it's like not easy to find."
1,Comedy [sic] Not Funny,"I bought this CD looking for laughs and ended up scratching my head. This CD is *NOT* a comedy CD. There are no jokes; there's not even any talking. And most of all, it's not funny. It's not funny! IT'S NOT FUNNY! Though I have a feeling this joker is laughing at me and anyone else who bought this decidedly non-comic CD."
4,Great Size For The Gym,"Strong and sturdy. The bag has one large compartment, 2 large side pockets (one is a shoe compartment) and one front pocket. Both side pockets have water tight stitching, with vents on the side.As an added bonus, the bag comes in a zipper bag, which is large enough to hold bathroom supplies :)Its just the right size for a gym locker, not too small not too large."
4,Lots of hard to find info on unusual aircraft types,plus production histories as well as specs and lots of pictures of the planes painted with squadron and theater markings etc.. Also a good resource for modellers.
4,Knowledge Is Key.,Excellent for understanding the process. Especially when you are coming from a telecine film background. It has helped me immensely.
4,Getting better,"A country and western music star is scheduled to visit his claimed home town and visit his dear old great-aunt. The usual Maggody misadventures and murders familiar to all ardent Hessians take place.I think this is a series that gets better as it goes on. There is a certain crudity and dependence on cliches and stereotypes in the earlier character drawing. The fat girl Delia is greedy; the preacher is a hypocrite. The later ones have more subtlety.""She had her cat, Pussy Toes, her apartment in a quiet neigborhood, her meetings of the genealogical society, her knitting projects for nieces and nephews, and her annual vaction to a family-run hotel in Mexico where she remained drunk out of her mind for ten days straight."" You might accuse Hess of making fun of alcoholism in that portrait of Miss Vetchling but it has a certain style and sharpness."
2,Maggody Blues,"I wanted to like this story, but all the characters, with the exception the the lead character, sound exactly the same. It had a few cute moments, but generally I had trouble finishing. I give it two stars."
4,Great nutcracker set,"I gave several of these sets as gifts, and they were appreciated by all. The nut holder lets you display just the right amount of nuts in the shell, and the handy cracker is of good quality, so it's useful as well as handy. Lots of family and visitors will crack and eat nuts in the shell if you make it easy for them, and that's exactly what this product does. Do have a bowl beside it for them to put the shells into. For informal visits, sitting around talking and cracking nuts gives a homey feeling to the gathering and encourages that welcoming feeling we all strive for."
2,Disappointing,"I like the first EA active. This one was very disappointing to me. I like the sports-type exercises, and this one has only 2 new ones- paddling and waterskiing. The squash is just a re-hash of tennis from the first one, while the boxing is the same as the first one, just featuring a person instead of targets. Very limited selection of stuff compared to the original EA active."
3,Fair game!,"Didn't use it since bought it, the game exercising is not very funny, just so so, didn't include the black band."
2,"Great workout , but Annoying as heck!","Okay, this is a great workout and could have been a great idea if it were not for the annoying thigh strap (which holds the nunchuck) I had to keep stopping and pulling the dang thing back up on my thigh as it repeatedly keeps sliding down.. and also the nunchuck is hard to insert back in the holster, which is required to take in and out again and again. If it were not for these unavoidable hassles it would be a fun to use every day, but mine is back in the box where it will most likely stay."
1,Incomplete,It needed a special holder to hold the num chuck. Software unusable without it. Ad never said anything about needing something else.
1,Leg band required without telling you.,You need to purchase a leg band in order to use this. You can't use without it. It doesn't tell you it is required until you go to use it.
2,Haven't been able to use yet,"So I guess I didn't read the details well enough to realize that the leg bands used on this version are not the same as the legbands used on the Active 2 game. So now I have to buy more stuff before we can use this game. It might be awsome but I'm not happy about having to spend more money on Wii accessories. I wanted to post this so that others aren't caught off guard the way I was. Like I said, I must not have read the packaging well enough - but it doesn't use the same leg bands as the other Wii Active games."
3,Didn't know this was the older version,I thought this was a new edition. Active 2 is fantastic. Have lost 8 pounds in 2 months and still enjoy the workout.
5,Awesome Workout!,"I'm so happy that I purchased this software. It's a great way to stay in shape in a fun way. I like beating the expected calories to burn and receiving my trophies. I have to say that I didn't expect the workouts to be so intense and fun at the same time. My body is feeling the workout... and I look forward to the transformation from it.I love working out with boxing, water skiing, jogging, step areobics, and many other ways of getting the heart pumping and getting into better shape. I'm 100% satisfied with this product."
3,Fun way to get the blood pumping!,"Previously I used Fitness Coach, which I liked too, but this is a good change of pace. Very different in the areas it focuses on-and I burn more calories (if you believe the numbers the game tells you). The only problem I really have is that some of the exercise that require use of the elastic band (included) can be awkward while holding the remotes in both hands. The cord from the nunchuk can also be a problem during exercises that require hands being held far apart, like one where you bring your knee up and your outstretched arms down at the same time."
5,I love it!!!,I purchases WII Active and More Active at the same time. I love them both. I am alternating the challenges because each one does exercises a little different. I would recommend them both to everybody who wants to work out or lose weight and doesn't know where to start.
2,Poor reaction time,"First, you do not need to purchase the first wii active to use this one, also you can not use any of the first wii active activities on this game they do not transfer over, unlike with the wii fit plus. In addition you will most likely face problems with the nunchuk syncing, the activities are pretty good but because of the sync problems I would not recommend this game. It is very frustrating."
2,Not safe for people with latex allergies,"The accessories in this game are made of natural rubber latex, so if you have allergies, this is not a game for you. Thank goodness I found out before I bought the game!"
2,It's okay,"Got this along with EA Active 2. Have never used EA Active 1. Compared to EA Active 2 it is just okay. I could do without this game. It is frustrating because you cannot use the wireless sensors and heart rate monitor that come with the EA Active 2 and the cord gets tangled up when you're working out. After I was done with the 9 week program in EA Active 2 I tried doing the 6 week program in this game, and after the first workout I was so bored with it that I couldn't go on. I will probably give this away. It would be okay for someone who is just used to the original maybe, but this is not comparable to EA Active 2."
5,Yes!,So far I've only used this once; I'm scheduled to workout today with my 6-week challenge program but I love it...it's working out while playing a game which makes it fun and a good workout...I can feel it in my muscles
5,great product! Better than the 1st one,this one is better than the 1st one ! spent about 40 minutes every other day on this work out ! very balance and new excercise is quite nice ! the only problem I hae with some excercise where the remote does not get translate well and register to the excercise!
3,"Not current, uses nunchuk...","I have the three EA programs. The first used a nunchuk and cord and was cumbersome. The second EA2 was much improved with the arm and leg band. No more whipping yourself with the cord as you exercised. I thought the ""More Games"" was for the most recent. It too, uses the nunchuk and cord... Though I have used it a few times the old technology is a bummer. Also when the batteries fade on the Wii fitness board it offers ""replace batteries or de activate board"". When you deactivate you lose the rest of the exercise and it moves to the next one (losing the intended time for your total work out)."
5,Great workout,This is a great workout....thinking about cancelling my gym membership! I would recommend it for anyone! It is a good addition to the original active...or you can just buy this one and get a great workout.
3,Advance levels only!!,"This book is a great book for those who are teaching either advance photography or at the college level. I am teaching a beginning class and this book was not much help. I was hoping for more lesson plan ideas and there were not as many as I had hoped. This book is probably a good book to read during abreak or over the summer, but not a good book for quick resources."
4,"Emphasis on ""Teaching""","I purchased this to help create the curriculum for a high school photo 1 class inaugurated this year at my school. This book is not what I expected. It is much more about teaching pedagogy and not as much photography. That being understood it is still a well designed book.The target audience is most definitely a student of education aiming at a fine arts credential focusing on photography. It reads like a college textbook.Note: I was about to return this book because it had little usable ""photography"" content. However, I took a closer look - a deeper reading - and found information that would be useful for improving my teaching of photography as a fine art. I am keeping the book."
5,one of buck's best cd's !!!,"truly a gifted artist,buck's second album/cd ""you're for me"" is another reasonwhy he's an exellent singer / songwriter. there is a lot to like about this cd.songs like ""down on the corner of love"",""under the influence of love"",""nobody's fool but yours"",as well as some great instrumental pieces.such as ""mexican polka"",""country polka"" are great examples of the buckaroos at work.i'm a long time fan of buck's and i highly recommend anyone of his re-mastered cd's!YOU WON'T BE DISAPPOINTED AT ALL! the only trouble is the series is incomplete.whatever happened to the rest of the 70's albums buck recorded for capitol?from 1973 to 1975,there are at least 2 more cd's to look forward to.not sure of the exact names,but songs like ""it's a monster's holiday""""on the cover of the music city news"",as well as the the duet withsusan raye albums. all in all,a exellent collection to get.a wonderful person,he will be missed by all true country fams!!!"
2,BEWARE THE MP3 LINK,"April, 2009: an emergency disambiguation is called for, since Amazon has linked the (excellent) Sundazed reissue of the 1962 Capitol album ""You're For Me"" to some cheesy digital package provided by ""Chacra Music"" that contains early works by Buck Owens, but is not the same album. It has fewer tracks, and they are mostly different material. Just thought I'd warn you. Too bad Amazon hasn't provided any mechanism for customer feedback in the MP3 store the way they did for CDs... there are a LOT of database errors so far, and this is the only way to point them out. (DJ Joe Sixpack, Slipcue music reviews)"
4,Great Textbook,I feel this book is well-written and easy to read. Lots of actual essays keep it interesting.
4,First time online shopper,I received the book in a very timely manner and it was in great condition.Karen
1,Perspectives of arguement,I was told the the book shipped on the 22nd of December. It is now the 21 st of Jan and I still have not recieved the book...If I have not recieve the book by weeks end I will be requesting a refund...
1,Physics Principles and Problems,This is acually Jonathan Ray of Midlothian Virginia. I have spent many a late night pondering over the absutities I have read in my physics book. I am atempting to learn physics from this book but it seems that all I am learning is how to draw silly little pictures. The answers in the back of the book to the practice problems are wrong tothe point that I am woried when I get an answer that agrees with the the back of the book. On top of this there are numerous typeos on the text. On top of this there is no actual organization in the book as one has to read several chapters to understan Newton's laws which are presented out of order I might add. Overall a very confusing text that is not worth the paper it is printed on.
5,Happy birds,"These treats are perfect for smaller birds and all my birds love them. And the resealable bag actually seals. They are hard to find in the stores and this was an excellent, excellent deal."
5,Good customer service,The order process was simple. The order was processed and shipped in a timely manner and the product was received in good condition. The price was very competitive also. All-in-all an excellent customer experience.
4,IQUEST ROCKS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I am in 4th grade going on to 5th, I love the iquest! There is only one thing, I like algebra and selected an algebra book for 6th-8th grade but I don't know if it's the right one and now every time I play it, it will go stright to that textbook. Please help me!"
2,iquest,"My child HAD to have it. Once she got it with two additional cartridges sold seprately, she found it boring."
5,GREAT LEARNING AID!!!,"ALTHOUGH I DO NOT FIND THE IQUEST ""FUN"", I DO THINK IT IS A GREAT LEARNING AID FOR MIDDLE SCHOOL CHILDREN. ON THE CARTIRIGES, YOU CAN EVEN FIND YOUR OWN TEXTBOOK TO SPECIFY YOUR TESTING.THE IQUEST IS ALSO DURABLE. I HAVE YOUNGER SIBLINGS, AND AFTER ALMOST THREE MONTHS, IT STILL DOES NOT HAVE ANY PROBLEMS OR SCRATCHES!!"
3,iQuest,"i think that the iquest is way too much i can get the iquest at target for only $15.00.... ya 15.00 so toys r us can you beat that ??? and this has been out for a while, you should lower the price by now or nobody will buy it from you!!!"
1,not worth your $,"This thing is not cool! It's like you buy the 5th grade math cartridge and before you know it you're in 6th grade, or it doesn't even have your textbook. A couple months ago I bought the 5th grade math cartridge for the old iQuest and guess what? In my class we're doing 6th grade math! I had wasted my $ and I'll never buy that again!!! (Plus the old one at least is so boring, they try to disguise the- ugh- learning with address books and stuff but it is still too much learning. It's like extra homework!!!)"
1,awful,"This is one of the worst pieces of garbage i have ever bought! I spent extra money because I thought I was getting hardwood, but this POG is mostly made of composite board. the pieces did not fit together well and the whole thing collapsed after i finished loading CD's onto it. I had to reconstruct it using screws. UGH!"
5,Teaches the mindset for successfully managing a project,"I agree with the previous review that there are many implicit lessons to be learned--such as creating a rapport with the people you work with. Most projects fail because of communication--or lack there of--not technical issues. This book is full of nuggets of wisdom, albeit common sense for project managers who have learned them the hard way--from their own mistakes. So, do yourself a favor and buy this book so you can learn from other's mistakes."
2,Not Her Best,"I very much enjoy reading Joan Smith Regencies. Occasionally, one of her many books just falls below the mark. For an author who was able to write 4 to 6 books a year, I am surprised that this doesn't happen more often. The story drags because the character development is more shallow in this novel than in most of her others. I think she was in a hurry to meet a publishing deadline or something. I might not finish this one. Just not one of her best."
1,"The balls are fine, but the company is not.","The balls are great, how can you mess that up. But gamecraft cannot seem to get the number of balls right. I ordered 72, and I got 12. I called to get the order right and I was sent 12 again. It has now been over 2 weeks and I am still waiting for the 72 to show up."
1,The Apocalypse: In the Teaching of Ancient Christianity,How could I possible like this book? Pages 64 through 97 were missing from the book. When I asked Amazon they never responded to my request for a another and complete copy. As a whole book this might be a valuable read.
2,Orthodox Church interpretation,"This book is an interpretation of the Apocalypse of John (Book of Revelation) made by an old Bishop of the Russian Orthodox Church. As an evangelical christian I can tell you that you may find other books about the Revelation more interesting, specially dealing with the last days events, the tribulation, the rapture of the Church. None of this you will find in this book. I will highly recommend the Prophecy Study Bible if you are interested in the matter of escathology, or the study of the last events that will happen as prophesized in the Holy Scriptures. This poor Bishop don't even think of the Rapture of the Church. You need a better reading. This is a poor exposition of the Biblical Truth.I hioghly recommend:The Feasts Of The Lord God's Prophetic Calendar From Calvary To The KingdomNew Spirit-Filled Life Bible: Kingdom Equipping Through the Power of the Word (Bible Nkjv)The Theology of the Book of Revelation (New Testament Theology)"
4,The Story we Find ourselves in.,Had to buy for a uni subject. Was an interesting read; couldn't decide whether I liked the way the author presented the Biblicla narrative or not. Decided while reading that I am not really a fan of Kindle reading- prefer to hold a book. That's a personal preference. Instant delivery is very handy.
5,More McLaren Brilliance,"Another great title by McLaren. Explores a meta-narrative to live by, and includes some tthought provoking points to reflect on and stew over.Don't bother with this book if you dont have an open mind. It is challenging, and can at times take a couple of reads of a sectionto really embrace it. If you dont read this book in the way it was meant to by read, in the spirit that it was meant to be view in, then chances are you will hate it.As for me... I love it, if you are looking for inspiration, go right ahead"
1,Truth has no expiration date. I don't need what you're selling.,Read 2 Timothy 4:3-5.Read Mclaren's book.Read 2 Timothy 4:3-5 again.The Word of God is eternal. All else is deception.
3,"Good information, bad format","I'm glad to see someone in the Christian writing field able to put a less ""fundamentalized"" view of belief into the popular marketplace, so I applaud McClaren's effort and courage. And I agree or at least share parallels with most of his thoughts regarding scripture, creation, eschatology, and the notion of the kingdom/revolution of God. But as I read I couldn't shake the feeling that I was watching a TV movie-of-the-week. The use of one-dimensional fictional characters to relay this information just didn't work for me. And I felt that too often the various threads or stages of the story ended up with rather simplistic, overly idealistic wrapups.For thoughts/ideas along a similar line in a more poetic yet technically satisfying format, I heartily recommend the writings of Pierre Teilhard de Chardin, especially ""The Divine Milieu"". I find his ""vision"" better reflects my experience as a modernist with spiritual foundations."
2,not the old school leman russ,i was lead to believe that this was the old school leman russ by the first review.... it was not. it was the brand new one which is what i didnt want to buy
5,"Smartest, funniest, most practical","This must be the smartest, funniest, and most practical guide to the spiritual path I have ever read. By using funky American pop culture (knock-knock jokes, ""Doggie in the Window,"" etc.) as his jumping-off point, Sluyter manages to present enlightenment in a way that anyone can connect with. He writes with a wonderful openness that embraces Zen, Jesus, rock 'n' roll and Mad magazine in one big hug - yet he never goes New Age sloppy, but lays out the What's What of spiritual development with precision. A must!"

3,Melville Goodwin USA,"The book was in such poor condition (age, and dry binder, and odor) that I threw it in the trash.It may be a good book."
3,not so tickled....,the book was ok. I was disappointed that it was so short on pages and just a basic touch and feel book. There are some beter ones out on the market that tickle the fancy better. If the book was marked down to four dollars than it would be worthy of price. It is still however hardback and easy for baby to hold.
2,Disappointment,Skip this book. Love touch and feel books for my children but was not impressed with this one. The book is poorly made. This book did not catch the attention of my children like others. Disappointed in the quality and design.
2,Skip this book,"I bought this book because it had 11 5-star reviews. However, I couldn't even read it once to my kid, it is truly inane! Given the plethora of intelligent, colorful, stimulating baby books out there, this is eminently skippable. Get your baby one of the ""That's Not My..."" books instead!"
5,Helpful Book,I am a counselor and this book is helpful in desensitizing my clients to touch. A wide range of things to feel in this book :)
1,Wheel on the bus not happy,"The songs are sung in a down voice ( not upbeat ).The cartoon drawings are not cute and not happy.Very few songs, and not all are popular songs."
1,Terrible,This video was so painful. My 22mo old daughter and I couldn't even finish the whole thing. What a waste of $.
3,Wheels on the Bus review,"It is an OK DVD. My grandson doesn't like all the songs on the DVd, the 3rd one is too slow, he likes faster pace songs."
3,Not for 1-year olds,"Maybe somewhere it tells an age category for this DVD but I missed it and bought it for a one-year old. This is way too advanced for a one year old - even one who knows the wheels song - The song is much too long and too many ""musical interludes"" between verses. Maybe for older children."
5,"Wonderful, no-frills, classic entertainment.","I originally borrowed this DVD from our public library, and my two-year-old liked it so much that I bought it for her third birthday. She watches it a few times a week, and it's one of those rare kids' sing-alongs that I don't mind listening to over and over, either. My 'tween doesn't even mind it, and that's really saying something!My little one usually asks me to replay the title song, which I was surprised to learn is performed by The Bacon Brothers Band---actor Kevin Bacon and his brother Michael. It's a very pleasant song, and it has me looking into more of their music. (They also perform the title song on Sandra Boynton's ""Dog Train"" CD, and they have their own adult-music CDs.)We enjoy ""Dem Bones,"" ""I Want a Dog,"" and ""The Chinese Violin,"" and Burl Ives' version of ""I Know an Old Lady"" makes me laugh out loud at the end. My personal favorite is ""Over in the Meadow,"" which also makes a great lullaby."
5,wheels on the bus,"I have three grandson ages 6, 2 and 21 months and they lovethis video.I bought one for my house and had to buy two more so everyone could have one at each house"
4,Very Satisfied,I bought this video for my 2 year old daughter and she loves it. Thank goodness it is on DVD because I think she would wear the picture off of a VHS tape she watches it so much. Very glad I found this DVD for her.
5,Favorite books come to life,I'm a special ed teacher for K-1 and my students love these videos. They add a visual depth to these classic stories. Don't forget to view the extras and you can also have the words displayed as well. I find them invaluable for illuminating literature. Most stories are no more than 7-10 minutes long and so are great for getting students involved quickly. Well worth the price. Students ask for them over and over again. Get the books too and students begin to engage with the books and get excited keeping up with the video.
5,ESL teacher,"I am an ESL teacher living in Spain. I use this sing along DVD to teach children to read in English, because it has the read along option. My students enjoy the wheels on The Bus video so much, that I have planned some lessons around different songs. For example today we are going to finish learning ""Dem Bones"". Students will cut out and assemble a paper skeleton. Then they will fill in the blanks on a worksheet with the names of the bones. Another song that all my classes enjoy is ""I Want a Dog"". They just can't get enough of it."
4,Stompin' K'NEXosaurus what a find!,"Rarely does a toy exceed my expectations for my son. I am usually right on with my expectations. This one, especially for the price, was so much more! It offers two different sets of directions for two types of dinosaurs, which gets you started. From there, you child can let his or her imagination create all sorts of new dinosaurs, whether you attach the motor for movement or not.K'NEX products have been a favorite in my home since my mother-in-law purchased my son's first set for Christmas when he was 3. I am extremely pleased that now he is older, there are even more choices for him that continue to fuel his imagination, and are developmenally appropriate."
5,great and helpful book,great and helpful bookthis book contained many great insights an tips on grandparenting.it was very very very helpful.i would recomend it
4,night sky dark blue,"Sound Mind Sound Body is the kind of CD one can enjoy listening to out loud late at night without hearing to the neighbours complainting trough the apartment walls. It sound is quite gentle and calm and, listening to it, you can only free itself within, permit all those beams and rays of sound to gain dimension in your mind. And they do. It's compositions are all made of the same texture, they all have the same fluorescent night sky dark blue to which the plain in the cover is flying to, yet, as you listen to it, they all individualize in different ways, in different ""soundscapes"", with emotional tonalities that can only express themselves wholy using the instruments (mainly guitar)in an abstract way we're not used to listen often."
4,Wave Field,"Toral's first album orginally issued by Ananana, a composer/guitarist from Portugal (also 1/2 of No Noise Reduction). ""Sound Mind Sound Body"" gives a glimpse of what the future will reveal in the brilliant My Bloody Valentine-esque sound world called ""Wave Field"". Never has the guitar sounded like this or perhaps this beautiful..."
4,Interesting use of past and present;sort of like a play,"Although the story was not all that original, I very much liked how the author was able to incorporate the early stages of the relationship with what was going on in the present. It made for very interesting reading"
3,Good Action movie,"I enjoyed this film lots of action but no nail bitter the plot has to unravel and when it doe's it comes to a interesting finish, the film did lack in your face action though."
1,do not buy if you want the one pictured,"The item I received is not what is pictured. I was told when I called that it was my error and that they sent me the correct item number. I asked if I could get the one in the picture because I needed the specific set up that was in the picture (the diverter was in a different location on the one I received)...to that I was told it wasn't available any longer and I must have looked at an old thread online. I just opened it up again today and they are still offering it here on Amazon. On the bright side, they did agree to pay for the return shipping and hopefully the return process will go smoothly."
5,"Incredible book, wonderful insight",Michelle McKinney Hammond is a wonderfully illustrative author who draws you in with her down to earth humor and wisdom. It's definitely worth the time to go thru the study guide in the back of the book as you really go along thru the book. I can't wait to read more of Hammond's work.God bless!
1,Pure Garbage,"This author's book is garbage, pure unadulterated garbage. She makes false claims of what pleases a man, and how a lady should act. I had quite a few men take a look at the suggestions, men from all walks of life both corporate and blue collar workers, all agreed that the suggestions made by the author would make them turn away from a woman, not pursue her further. Perhaps next time this author chooses to write a book such as this, she should request the assistance of a male counterpart for him to tell us what males like, and makes them want to pursue us."
5,THE REAL RULES IF YOU WANT A REAL MAN!!!,"I honestly thought I would be reading a stuffy, moralistic ""close-your-legs-avert-the-eyes"" book that would talk down to me and detail the ways I was destined to burn in hell, but Michele writes like the experienced, loving older sister who's been there and done that, and she condemns no one. Her ""principles,"" which basically explain the biblical and common sense that we lost sight of in ""modern"" times, do nothing less than honor the woman and seek to put her in her rightful place: the apple of the man's eye, the queen on her throne next to the king. I would heartily recommend any woman who's healing her heart and seeking a loving, christian-based relationship to buy this book, follow her advice and watch the brothers come RUNNING!! I cannot wait to get ahold of her next one and learn even more. WE are the queens to be pursued and treasured, and God designed it that way, she tells us....and how can you not be down with that???"
5,A NEW WOMAN,"WOW! This book was so awesome...again, the title would make you think you would become so intriguing and irresistible you'd snag your next mate. NOT SO!This book helped you to wash away the residue of old hurts and wrong mindsets. To have a heart for the Lord! SO WONDERFUL!I bought 8 copies of this book for friends and family. It was so life changing I had to share this wealth of knowledge."
3,Worth reading,"This book is good, lust wish she wasnt so preachy in tone, overall it has a lot of very good information and insight."
1,Problem for Install,I had trouble installing this type of processor which is not as standard with pentium 3 motherboards available on the market if anyone is going to buy this type of processor first verify that your card supports it.
4,Ballard's quest to find the RMS Titanic,"Being an absolute fan of the Titanic, this novel by Robert Ballard was very interesting. He takes you from Woodshole to the North Atlantic Ocean to search for the Titanic. Then he narrates the discovery of the great ship while he takes you 2 miles below the surface to explore the famous ill-fated liner."
4,"Lots of info, some of it outdated","I am involved in the TITANIC project extensively, and have used Dr. Ballard's book for reference on many occasions. What I have discovered is that it is an admirable effort, based on the information available at the time. Of course, all of his first-hand information is accurate. The info on the current state of the wreck, his photomosaics, and the artwork included inside is not entirely accurate. Based on what Dr. Ballard's team knew at the time of publication, it cannot be faulted. However, much has been learned since then. Readers should be careful not to accept only one source for info on this, or any subject. A good source is the series of shows that the Discovery Channel is doing on this subject. They have teamed with some of the best people in this field for extensive research on the wreck."
3,dicovery of the Titanic book review,"this copy of Ballard's discovery of the Titanic is a lot smaller than i was anticipating, which makes it harder to read. Overall the book is okay, but not as good as the full size model."
5,Excellent information source,"I bought this book (in hardcover) when it came out in 1988 (I was in 4th grade) and I have been fascinated with it since. This book is an excellent source of information from the man who discovered the Titanic. I do have one correction for the movie ""Titanic"" which I saw today; Dr. Ballard explored the interior of the ship with Jason Jr. back in the 80s and the movie doesn't give him credit for that."
5,"great for the money, and for the type.","This earphones sound great, and they are have really good looks, and fit. I myself didn't like the ""earphones"" thing, but man they do sound great. Much greater than the Ipod originals."
2,Griffin EarThumps,"I ordered white, but they sent me black. ;( I had heard some positive reviews of the EarThumps, so I expected them to sound better, but they were similar to cheaper earphones (not enough acoustic/bass sound), and sounded rather tinny to me.It's true what another reviewer said, that the connection from the wire to the jack is less sturdy than comparable sets.However, the earphone carrying case is kinda cute. ;)"
1,Ick. These ruined my music with their awfulness.,"These are the worst headphones I have ever owned, and I go through about one set per year. The bass was AWFUL, as was the overall sound quality. They only sounded okay when the volume on my iPod was turned up all the way - something I wouldn't want to do to my hearing. The headphones that came with my iPod were of a far better quality than these ones.I wish I had spent 10 more dollars and bought a pair of Sonys...or basically any other headphones than these. Worst of all is that I can't return these, so I am out $20 AND I have to pay $30-40 more to get a decent pair."
1,Didn't even last me 2 weeks!,"Everything is great about this product, EXCEPT THE DURABILITY! Granted I use my ipod everyday and these headphones are around $10, but they didn't even last me a month. The quality of the wiring is horrible. The wiring that connects to the headphone jack just died out and I don't have sound anymore. They do however block out sound, but I am definitely not going to purchase another pair."
2,"Sounds fine, but shoddy construction","This was my second pair of Griffin EarThumps. The first lasted about a year, before one of the wires frayed and I no longer got sound out of one side. I wasn't too perturbed since I only use them for jogging, and I figured that they were subject to a good deal of abuse. However, I wasn't thrilled enough to buy a second pair, at least not right away. One day, however, I saw them advertised on Amazon for $12.95 (since reduced to $10.95), so I thought, ""What the heck? Why not give them one more shot?"" I'm sorry I did. After only three or four uses, the sound went out on the left side. I know it's the earbuds and not the ipod, since other headphones work fine. The Griffin earbuds just don't seem to be made very well. If you plan to use them for jogging, you'd probably be better off looking somewhere else."
4,Really good sound- not as comfy as hoped.,"These really sound good but they aren't as comfortable in my ear as the skullcandy set that I have used- I have a small ear canal apparently. Also, I noticed that with the skullcandy set that I can't talk or eat or chew gum because I hear the sound in my ears, whereas I can with the earthumps- which I like. Hope this helps."
4,reliable,"I've had these for a few months now and the only complaint i have is that they fit one ear better than the other. but i can deal with that, they have great sound quality and block out the other gym noises with minimal volume which is important. over all i'd reccomend them just watch out if you have a small head or little ears."
3,Great Until They Break,"I loved these headphones. They are extremely comfortable in your ear and provide good sound. However as others have noted, after about 8 months the headphones started to short at the top of the connector and ultimately made them unusable. Since it seems almost everyone sees this problem, I'll have to find another pair of headphones to buy."
2,Frustrated,"I was so pleased with these when I bought them! They worked great, good sound quality, and fit so comfortably in my ears. However the durability of these things are horrible, I had them for about 4 or 5 months and the frail wiring broke on one bud and I couldn't get any sound on one of the ear buds. I was so frustrated! I would not reccommend these for long term use. Buy some Apple In Ear Headphones or Bose headphones. I was trying to save money and these headphones failed to live long."
3,Good earphones that conk out too early,"Here's the thing about Griffin earbuds. They're good if you can get them at a cheap used price. They stay in the ear well. But they usually conk out (the right side usually goes first) too soon, about a month or so after you buy them. This is my fourth pair. I'm used to having a good pair of headphones function for at least a year. They're great while they last though. This recent pair I bought has a inch of rubber reinforcement at the jack plug, perhaps to avoid having the sound go out so early. It helps because it doesn't bend so much at the jack when you wrap it around your music player when you're not using it. It's been good so far. I do recommend them but on average they're not worth more than say 10 bucks."
1,"2 months, then nothing","I loved these earbuds for the first two months. I raved to my friends. I bought pairs for several people at work. Then, about a month later, my boss came to me and told me one of the earbuds stopped producing sound. I thought it was because she was rough on them, but then quickly thereafter, my earbuds did the same thing... then another coworker had the same problem... all withing weeks of each other after purchasing them around the same time.I know they're cheap. I know they're comfortable, but seriously, you're going to spend three or four times the amount over the course of a year just replacing them, so you might as well buy something slightly more expensive and get more wear from them."
2,Great fit/stop working quick,"I love the fit of these earthumbs, unfortunately, like the other reviewers, one of the earpieces stops working quickly. I thought I was being rough on them because I use them when I work out. I have bought 3 pairs and the my experience has been that the left earthumb will stop working. Unfortunately, the last pair only lasted about 6 weeks."
2,Poor Design,"I bought this case and found it unsatisfactory for use even at the relatively low price. It is made of very stiff bulky leather that adds a lot of weight and bulk to my otherwise sleek Palm TX. The double layer front cover to give simple web pocket storage for memory cards does not protect the cards from dirt and dammage and finially, the belt clip is ineffective. After only a few minutes seated in my vehicle it slid off my belt and luckly landed on the seat. Could just as easily landed on the street resulting in dammage to my PDA. I was offered 12% discount to buy more from the dealer but declined. Good idea - Bad design."
3,Not for the Nokia E61/E61,The description states that this case is for the Nokia E61. Be aware that this case is way too big for it. There is probably half an inch of space left which makes the case much bigger than needed.Other than that it seems to be a fine case.
2,Doesn't really work with the E62-E61,"This thing is sitting in a drawer right now.It is too wide to accomodate the E62 I own which makes getting it out of the case impossible. I jury rigged a piece of black covered foam in the bottom just so I wouldn't need two hands to get my cell phone out.When it started dialing a number every time I closed it, it went into the drawer forever.I gave it a star above terrible because it really is well made... just not well made for the E62."
2,Good case for a pda with no extras,"I bought this case for two reasons: a belt loop that meant I didn't have to rely on a flimsy clip, and a storage compartment for memory cards. First of all, the case is a good fit for my AT&T; 8525 with a hard plastic shell. It's a snug fit, almost perfect. The problem is, if I put a single SD card with case in the web holder, the magnetic latch no longer snaps right in place, and when I do get it in place, it comes open far too easily in my opinion.The search continues."
3,Could be improved,"This holster was listed as suitable for a Palm T|X, but needs some work to be really useful.1. It is too wide for the T|X. You could literally put two of the Palms in it.2. The clasp is a magnetic button which has to be aligned perfectly with the receiving slot of catch. A full magnetic cover would be more secure and avoid the hassle of making sure the cover is secured.3. The pivot belt clip is very loose. Recognizing that it needs to be rotated, it still flops around too much when worn.JTB10 Oct 2007"
2,First time I lost data,After a few years using flash drives this is the first time I lost huge amount of data. One briefcase folder just became suddenly empty and another folder appeared with file damaged. both problems in the same episode.
5,My favourite band...ever.,"Anyone who's into music for music's sake will love this. Personally, I don't know why they^re not wildly famous. I mean, ""Periodic Table"" got me through high school. Now, almost through with college, they are still my all-time favourite band. Highly, highly recommended."
1,"Buy one, get another !","It appears, after much correspondence, that Amazon/Fogdog had no intention of selling the advertised item (baseball glove) at the advertised price. In classic ""bait and switch"" sales tactics, they, instead, sent a pair of shoes (of some haphazardly chosen size) instead of the right hand throw baseball glove ordered.At the ""end of the day"", they did not even offer to remedy their apparent fraud by offering to supply the ordered item, the Akadema ADB-138 baseball glove from any number of reputable vendors which carry this item.What makes this situation all the more heinous, is that if I had not happened to open the baseball glove which I ordered for my son for Christmas, but just wrapped the box it was shipped in, my son would have been more than the disappointed boy who did not get the glove he had asked for, but a pair of the wrong size shoes, for which he had no use !The only offer from Amazon/Fogdog was that I could buy something else from them !"
4,"Definitely, Maybe","This is the VERY FIRST BOOK where the author discredits himself in the very first sentence --literally. Still, the subject is fascinating to me and, therefore, I'll read anything that has to do with it. If you're interested in this type of subject, then you'll like it. If you want first-hand accounts, look for another book."
5,It's different in a very good way,"Canadian-born Dr. Peter Vronsky is an author, filmmaker, artist and historian. He has been shooting and producing investigative documentaries and independent films since 1975.He has worked in Europe, the former Soviet Union, Middle-East, South Africa and in Canada and USA. He has produced and directed numerous cutting edge investigative documentary television specials on subjects ranging from early punk rock and flashback syndrome in Vietnam war veterans to organized crime and nuclear materials smuggling in the break-away regions of the former Soviet Union.Peter Vronsky's extensive, varied background must contribute to a very different and enjoyable book about serial killers.This book is well-worth the money."
4,Good book by a talented amateur,"Peter Vronsky has an interesting personal perspective on serial killers. His book does not try to be a definitive source on all serial killers, but does try to provide an over view to the world that some of these killers live in. His writing is thought provoking and brings to light many interesting statistics and facts about both serial killers and profilers. Definitely a great read for both the amateur as well as the professionals who may have to be searching for the killers. Also has a nice bonus chapter about surviving serial killer abductions."
2,HY Flag Is Down,I read this book when I was very young because my mother did. This time it wasnt as good as I had thought it was when I was too young to be reading it.
2,My Flag is Down,Purchased this book as a gift for my sister and had it mailed to her in Georgia. It arrived extremely musty which makes it hard to read for any length of time. She wants to keep the book so I will not be requesting a return/refund.
1,NOT CLOSE TO GOOD,"i love the 10 inch hitachione of the finest tools aval.but this 12 inch sliderlooks like someone wanted to make a diff cool looking sawthats fine but why make it a poor quality toolits heavier than most every saw really heavy,one guy will struggle to carry thisand forget getting it through a hallit claims to need less space behind the saw due to its special slideri checked from the back of my board to the saw slider all the way backit takes up more MORE spaceTHIS IS IMP> the saw moves left to right with the most slop of any slider over $100did not like this saw"
4,Great saw!,"The saw works great. It doesn't look like a refurb at all, except for the fact that it comes in a plain brown box strapped to a pallet. The only complaint that I have is that it doesn't have holes in the back of the base to mount it to a stand. There are holes in the front, but none in the back. It's not a big deal, the holes in the front seem to work well enough, but it wouldn't have been very hard to put a couple holes in the back of the base for mounting."
4,Great Saw.,"I purchased this saw at Lowe's last Saturday and I find it great. Love the sliding rail system - real space saver. The only adjustment that I had to make was aligning the laser. The only fault that I found is that it is missing the cover on the back of the arm. So was the store display model (Hey, Hitachi, did you run out and decide to continue production anyway?). Not a big deal. I e-mailed Hitachi and am awaiting a response. This saw is comparable to saws costing 50% more - and it doesn't have the clumsy safety trigger (I dislike those things). At first I wasn't very thrilled about the vertical handle, but I'm finding it easier to use with either hand than the horizontal handle of other saws. All in all, a great saw. Would have rated it 5 stars if it had come with the back cover."
4,Hitachi 12 inch miter saw,"It has so far with an upgraded blade handled the maple crown and base with no problem. It is not meant to be a Portable saw, you will need a good stand."
2,should have stayed in the 80's,"Well, what can I say.....Simon should have stayed in the 80's. I was so excited to hear about this CD being released, and then so disappointed when I heard it. I think that they have finally sold out to the masses"
1,HORRIBLE!!!!!,"OMG, you gotta be kidding me with this! What a disappointment! Not even OK...just HORRIBLE! The worst DD album ever. 1 star was the lowest score...it should be no stars."
4,Nostalgia and the Future,"One thing about Duran Duran is that every album is different from the rest. Interestingly enough, several of the tracks on ""Pop Trash"" have a nostalgic feeling to them...reminiscent of songs from previous albums.My favorites are: ""Mars Meets Venus"" - personal classifieds woven into a great dance tune that follows in the footsteps of ""Electric Barbarella"" and ""All She Wants Is"". ""Someone Else, Not Me"" - musically it's ""Come Undone"", lyrically it's ""I Don't Want Your Love"" with a heart. ""Playing with Uranium"" - the lyrics are just too clever, and the heavy guitar riffs set the mood. ""Lava Lamp"" - fusion of the 70's, the Orient, and a little techno...it's up beat and catchy.All in all, it's definitely worth a listen."
4,"""Pop Trash""....worthy or not worthy?","Since 1982 I have been a fan of Duran Duran & their music. And with their latest ""Pop Trash"", must admit, on the first listen, my expectations had not been met to their fullest. HOWEVER, by the 3rd listen, I was hooked! Every song on this album is worthy of listening to. ""Playing w/Uranium"", & ""Something To Remember"" are excellent. Do think they could've had a few more up-tempo songs on this CD, however, not bad for some ""80's has-beens"" (as most of their critics like to refer to them by), but Duran Duran is very much alive! Their live shows only prove how withstanding their music really is...""Pop Trash"" is certainly not trash; if you give it more than a listen or two, chances are, it will grow on you."
2,Well Titled,"I've loved Duran for years, but this is a really poor effort. There is not a single catchy song to be found on the album. Some of the songs are hard to even get through. It's a long way from the days of A View to A Kill and Rio."
1,"Yeah, that's what it is... trash!","I anxiously awaited the release of this album, I shelled out 17 bucks for it, and what did I get? Trash! I used to be a huge fan of theirs, but they have gone so far downhill (and OVER the hill) that I think they should cut their losses and split up! As for this particular album it only has 2 songs on it that are worth listening to. ""Someone Else Not Me"" which is a perfect breakup song, and ""Playing With Uranium"". The rest of the album is terrible! So I would say, save your money and don't even buy it because it's not worth it for just 2 songs."
2,Pop trash is not trash but it's no treasure either,"First I will say I am a Duran Duran fan from way back (1982). I still get chills when I crank ""Come Undone"" and ""The Chauffer."" I bought Pop Trash on the day of it's release as I had waited over a year since seeing them live last summer (they performed Lava Lamp and Hellucinating Elvis). I really don't think their is anything good or original on this album. After taking so long to record it, it just falls flat. I thought it would grow on me but it's just plain boring. They have tons of b-sides better than this. Mendazaland (their previous album) was not that great either. Come on guys, three strikes you're out. Oh, and for a band who was always so into their album artwork, why did they reuse the ""45 rmp"" graphics idea again? Disappointed Durannie."
2,Pop Trash is what it is! From a fan of almost 20 yrs..awful,"I got this CD from a friend in the music business, because he knows I am a Duran Duran fan....but that faded in the early 90s after the Wedding Album when they came back with Pop infections like ""Ordinary World"", ""Come Undone"", and ""Serious....since then they have fallen apart with the bomb ""Medazzaland"" which included a song that sounded like any other 80s rehash ""Electric Barbarella"", now with ""Pop Trash"" which is absolutely the most appropriate title for a CD in years,...is just a producers nightmare....All the songs sound like a massive mess....Including ""Lady Xanax"".....This CD ( )! I give it 2 stars because they are Duran Duran...what is left of them....now with only (2) original members and John Taylor (who hasn't aged a day) gone Duran Duran should just put up their shoes and call it a day and commit themselves to the Shady Pines Rest Home, or start another band..........GRADE: D"
2,"immature, pop trash is the correct title for this CD.","I was bored the 1st time I listened to it. Then I sat down and listened again to see if maybe the art of the lyrics might make it worthwhile, since the music was simplistic and very forgetable. The lyrics were interesting in a way, but not enough to over come the musak quality of the sound. It is something you would play when you don't want people to focus on the music. I don't think that was the intent Duran Duran had. If you just need to have everything Duran Duran, then go ahead and buy this. If you wait you can pick up several cheap second hand at the local music shop."
2,Pretty awful,"I am a HUGE Duran Duran fan, one who has been around consistently since 1983, but I absolutely cannot stand all but 3 tracks. Besides Hallucinating Elvis, Mars Meets Venus and Playing with Uranium, this album literally makes me cringe when I hear it. I feel terrible turning on them in this way but I have to be honest. It is obvious that Simon's heart wasn't in it, and the fact that John is missing is painfully clear. The sound is sloppy, uncoordinated, the vocals are sad and weak, and the music chaotic. Sorry Duran Duran, but thank goodness for the records that followed this one!"
5,Duran show strength and vision with new 'Pop Trash',Duran Duran has managed to do it again: create a sensational album sounding nothing like they've done in the past. The album can be described as a journey through many different moods combined with the kind of passion and energy so lacking in today's typical rock music. Buy this CD. You'll be amazed!
4,Not Trash,"This is the second of the Duran Duran albums that I had avoided buying for some reason, I bought it based on the strength of ""Astronaut"", and I was pleasantly surprised, ""Pop Trash"" is a real treat. It has that mod, 60's feel to it. ""Starting to Remember"", ""Pop Trash Movie"" ""When Mars Meets Venus"" ""Lady Xanax"", the heartbreaking ""Someone Else Not Me"" and the hard edged ""Last Day On Earth"" all make this an exceptional album, all the tracks are great though, not just these. Definitely pick this one up, it's a lot of fun and proof that Duran Duran NEVER lost their touch to play around and stay relevant."
3,hot/cold CD,"Like most of the Duran output since the masterpieces ""Rio"" and Arcadia's ""So Red the Rose"", this album has about half exellent songs and half throw away. (""Liberty"" has the distinction of being almost all throwaway) The production is exellent and Simon's vocals are better than ever, but it just doesn't hold up as a whole work like the previously mentioned examples.""maddazzaland"" is probably their best modern album. ""the Wedding album"" has the classics ""Ordinary World"" and ""Come Undone"", but suffers from the same hot/cold syndrome as most of the their late 80's/ 90's and beyond output."
5,Not just Music--Good music,"This record is much more than I expected. I have every record the band made, but I think this one is nearly as good as RIO. It contains magnificiant ballads, great rock-songs and the most important: It sounds homogen. From the first to the last minute. It makes you dream and rock! ""Pop Trash Movie"" could be one of the gratest hits of the year, ""Playing with Uranium"", a great rock-song, too, if the medias let them be. This record deserves the best reviews and proves, that the band has passed a great developement in the last years. And if you have been Draun-Fan or not_ This record will please you!"
5,No Trash on Pop Trash,"Duran Duran have not returned to their 80s musical styles on this new album, instead the band has offered listeners new, mature songs and styles. Reminiscent of THE WEDDING ALBUM which produced the hits ""Ordinary World,"" ""Come Undone,"" and the minor hit ""Too Much Information"", POP TRASH offers the listener a variety of musical styles ranging from ballad (the hit single ""Someone Else Not Me"") to the pulsating (""Lava Lamp"") to the sinuous (""Playing With Uranium"") to the dance-track (""Mars Meets Venus"")and slow reflection (""Pop Trash Movie"") The styles of music on this album certainly run the gammet. It is evident that Duran Duran were not being prophetic when saying ""We'll all be famous for 15 minutes . . .""(Pop Trash Movie). With musical craftsmanship like this, Duran Duran are going to be around for a long time to come."
3,solid effort from DD but not brilliant,"""Pop Trash"" is a good effort from Duran Duran in 2000... but as a long time fan I was expecting a bit more. The album is not as consistent as I'd hoped, and after many listens I can't warm to some of the tracks: ""Last Day On Earth"", ""Hallucinating Elvis"", ""Lady Xanax"". However, there are some excellent songs here that make DD's existence into their third decade well worth it - ""Pop Trash Movie"", ""Playing With Uranium"", ""Lava Lamp"" and my personal favourite ""Starting To Remember"". I like this album a lot more than the almost unlistenable ""Medazzaland"", although it doesn't quite achieve the heights of the ""Wedding Album"", ""Rio"", or ""Big Thing"". Duran Duran deserve a big hit, as they are one of the best pop/rock bands of the last 20 years, although I doubt they will find it here. John Taylor's bass is also very missed."
3,Pop Trash! The Title says it All!,"As an avid fan of this band since their inception. I was disappointed with this CD. I was hoping, probably like so many others, this would follow the typical Duran Duran sound. Having recently seen the group in Concert now 2 years running, as Simon LeBon stated at the concert in Holmdel, NJ ""You win some, you lose some"" as he referred to the fans at the concert. It was apparent that the younger fans connected with this CD, however, the old fans were gritting their teeth through each selection they played from this album. I did not like the CD at first but it kind of grows on you! Give it a chance and maybe you'll like it as well!! Enough said, this should be a part of any avid fans collection."
2,Disappointing...,"After listening to Rio, Notorious and the Wedding album (their three best ones), this album is a disappointment for me. There are some great efforts on it (Pop trash movie, Mars meets Venus, Somebody else not me) but the rest is not remarkable. It seems that they try to find a new style in a new kind of music, which David Bowie had made years before with Earthling. But unfortunately that was better than this one. I hope that Duran returns to his roots, the new wave and funky line and leaves this futuristic sillinness behind on their next album, cause it's not Duran Duran anymore."
2,Couldn't wait for this album to come out,"Well, I have to say that I went to a Duran Duran concert [inAugust 1999] and couldn't wait for their new album to come out. I have been a fan for many years. I was disappointed with the album though. I guess I was hoping the album would be more like the older ones. But I am sure many of their fans may like it just because it's been so long that a new cd came out. I did enjoy their concert though. They sang many of their older songs. If you by their new one, I hope you enjoy it."
3,too-stuffed bean bag chair,"I purchased this bean bag chair for my grandson for Christmas, per his request. He likes it BUT...it's stuffed entirely too full. The zipper doesn't have a ""pull"" on it, so he can't take out some ofthe ""beans"" to make it more comfortable."
5,The school of hard knocks in one package,What an amazing achievement. Antoniak takes life's most problematic tasks and turns them into easily followed step by step processes. From the monumental -- buying a home -- to the mundane -- shopping for a used car -- Lifemaps offers solutions. Buy this book and you won't need to fill up your shelves with lots of other how-to books. Since I bought it I've used it dozens of times...and I've bought copies for all my kids too.
2,Used to be better,"I used to enjoy reading these books, but after they have changed the format, I have decided not to bother them anymore."
5,Best I've Had Yet From Joyce Meyer,Absolutely the best of her great testimonies. She makes you stand up and take a good look at yourself and do it while laughing and smiling. GREAT.
5,Just what I wanted,"I received The Battlefield of the Mind on time and the condition of the book was what I expected. I've enjoyed reading this book and also have purchased the DVD as well. The DVD is in excellent condition and easy to use. Both add extra insight to the other, a very helpful tool."
4,Nice top,Really like the design but didn't realize I would have to wear another shirt under it at all times. Thin fabric.
5,A Great Read...!,"(The Last Gate Series by Elizabeth A. Merz)Book #1:Betnoni's Prophecy(Quiet Storm edition)Well, this an Fantasy/Sci-fi book, however the technology partsare very easy to follow so don't worry,actually For me it's a more Fantasy/Politic book.The story move at a very good pace ..in the Prologuewe meet Betnoni's & Daka Redd..and there we learned aboutthose decisions & actions both of them take that lead to this Curse/Prophecy for generations..!this it's a wonderful world of Politics,Magic,Religion,Cruelty,Romance and of course action..and thats just to name an few..!the author ""Elizabeth Merz"" created an Huge new world full of wonderful characters,nations,cultures, races. and I mean an huge world building, indeed..!I'm Highly Recommended ""Betnoni's Prophecy""...and Book #2 Cobo's Quest as well...!"
1,Very poor...,"If this is the first time you encounter Linux then maybe you'll find some useful information in it, but even in that case I wouldn't offer you just that book. On the other hand, if you are not an absolutely beginner Linux user I hardly can imagine you'll see any use of it. 261 pages covering 10-page information. Doesn't worth it."
2,"Specific to the Debian Distribution v2, includes 3 - 4 CDs","This book is specific to the Debian GNU/Linux v2 distribution and would probably not be useful for people using/installing other distributions of Linux. It is very specific and good about the early stages of the installation process. But, you need to be somewhat knowledgeable about the command prompt to use this book. Also some interpretation of the info here is necessary. For example there is a chapter on dpkg, the underlying installation program, but it is very superficial and is no help if you get into trouble. This book is fairly good as far as it goes. Release version 2.0 has 3 CDs and version 2.1 has 4 CDs. This package includes 30 days of email support from the book publisher, Linux Press."
1,Not for beginning users of linux,"I have gotten this book and let me tell you, this book is not easy to follow. Plus, their outline of dselect is not very good. The book is over-priced and too small. I was better off with a distribution that came with a eight dollar magazine and it's 12 step installation. I even got it to function properly. After using this book and it's software, I ended up with way less than I wanted. Also, after running through the installation using this book, I ended up not being able to use windows because the lilo (Linux Loader, the boot-loader installed with linux) configuration file was extremely messed up with no option to load windows. The only example of ""multiple os installation"" is with loadlin (dos-based boot-loader) and not lilo."
5,Never give in!,"Excuse my poor English, I am the Ukrainian. I was overjoyed to read this book. The main lesson that man have to learn is how to resist to the deadline and what is the vigour exactly."
3,Useful but could also use improvement,"The CellStik performs its basic function well: It can back up the contact names, phone numbers, email addresses, and other personal information from your cell phone and transfer them to your computer. Unfortunately, at least on my LG VX4600 phone, that's all it seemed to back up. When I used Spark's PC application to view the data on the CellStik, it did not include specific ring tones for each contact, chosen user images or icons, or the categories I assigned them. As a result, if I had to restore my cell phone's information from the CellStik, I'd have a lot of cleaning up to do afterward. I was hoping for better."
5,The perfect reference book,"I did a lot of internet research, and even checked this book out from my local library, before I made my choice. I am a Master Electrician, and I needed a detailed electrical reference book for my own library. Since electronics is a part of electricity, and has a growing impact on the electrical trade, I wanted a book that combined the two. There are a lot out there. Many are overly long and detailed, others are too simplistic or youth-oriented, and some are outdated. This book was perfect. Although it is also intended for classroom use, with review questions and experiments, this wasn't something I needed. These portions are limited though, and don't detract from the book as a whole. Buy it!!"
2,Very confusing,"I'm a high school teacher using this book to teach a basic electronics class. I'm very disappointed in the quality of writing. What should be simple explanations of basic concepts are loaded down with tangential information and barely related photos. It gets worse when the more advanced topics come up. The authors don't seem to know how to streamline their writing to present key information first, then branch out to more detailed concepts--it's all jumbled together. I have a lot of electrical experience and know these concepts well, but there are even times that I feel confused after reading some of the chapters!I gave it two stars instead of one only because it IS very complete. All the information is in there...somewhere. Still, I will be using a different book next time around."
2,"Well, somewhat amusing, except for having no plot.","Well, when I saw this at the bookstore, I jumped to buy it. When I found out Qilue of Daughter of the Drow was in it, I was thrilled. However, the rest was fairly bad. The part of Dove's story when she is disguised as a drow is amusing, and I find her drow persona, Iylinvyx Nrel'tabra, the best character in the book. Qilue's story disappointed me, as she is nothing like she seems in DOTD. The Simbul's story was also fairly amusing, but the sisters' indestructablity grates on my nerves. There were some fairly random scenes in this book that, for all I could figure, had nothing to do with the so-called plot. And as for that, I had to dig very hard to find it. There just wasn't much of a rising action. *Shrugs* But, learning about the sisters I didn't know was fun."
3,"Alright, but why so BIG a volume?","This is really just a novel, in which each of the seven sisters passes on the baton to the next as part of a connected story. The device is a bit thin, but the book is perfectly readable, and fine as light relaxing fiction. I'd like more, as ever. Greenwood isn't a particularly good writer, but the work is edited competently and flows easily enough. It's no worse than the Elminster stories.The only gripe I had was with the physical format and cost. It's hard to hold so big a volume, and I object to paying extra for something that won't fit on my shelves.But if you like the Forgotten Realms setting, and have liked other Greenwood novels, I think you'll be happy with this one."
2,What first year editor ripped this book up?,"I've seen enough hacked up stories by editors to wonder if this doesn't qualify. The story builds up just fine, but doesn't fit at all with the ending. As a matter of fact. You could burn the last 20 pages and not miss the ending at all. What's there is no good. If it was meant to be a big surprise they at least need to put a little foundation in there to support it. And the cover summary isn't even really accurate. It almost feels like someone rewrote the ending and changed up a couple of characters a'la'gatekeeper or something. Wonderful book if you skip the ending, and Ed Greenwood has had some outstanding novels to date. So, for the fan, worth the buy. For someone looking at Greenwood for the first time, go buy Cormyr or even the Elminster stuff."
4,The Seven Sisters rock,Silverfall I have to say ranks right up there with my other favorites such as the Dark Elf Trilogy. If you just sarted to look at Forgotten Realms and have heard of the seven sisters but not read much about them then I suggest you get this book. You will get to see all 7 sisters at their best. If you have seen and read most of the books about Forgotten Realm then you should already have bought this. In simple terms to all this is a most buy.
1,Just plain bad,"I wish I'd read most of the reviews here before picking up this book. I wanted more on the relationships between the sisters, but instead we get one or two at a time. It's not a series of short stories, it's one long novel with different points of view (all strikingly similar.)Frankly, I've only read one other Ed Greenwood novel, where Elminster is in Myth Drannor, because I'm nuts for the history of elves. I disliked his portrayal of elves in that novel, and I dislike his portrayal of people in this novel. Isn't there ONE person in the Realms who can look at the Sisters and not think about sex??This does it. From now on, only Elaine Cunningham stories for me."
5,Best of the Inexpensive Loupes,"This is actually an MG960 10X loupe by Hawk. I tested several of the inexpensive loupes offered at Amazon in order to select one for a larger purchase to be used by professional printers. This was the best one in my estimation and the majority of the other people I showed it to. It is small, but the image is in good focus across the entire viewing area."
3,Very Helpful Info!,Very good book! Info is very helpful and enlighting. Price not bad either. Thank you for sharing your experiences with us.
5,catch that kid,"Very good children's film (ages 10 above). Lots'a action, well written/directed and above average (child) acting..."
4,Teenproof,"It reminded me of a movie called ""Foolproof"" with three people pretending to rob a bank as a game, but then a criminal steals their plan. Anyway this is a nice family movie. It may be a bit over the top in couple places, but what action movie isn't. One reviewer mentioned the ""Italian Job"", and their is some likeness to it as well. The movie has it's own unique story and I didn't feel as though I had seen it before. The kids playing the key characters are engaging and don't have attitudes. That was what I found most refreshing. Sometimes attitude is needed to make a role convincing, but here it wasn't warranted, and they don't use any. In a nutshell the story revolves around three kids robbing a bank to get just the money they need so a father to one and friend to the other two can receive lifesaving surgery. Their method to do it is involved and interesting. The DVD is good quality and it has good replayability for families with kids."
1,sent wrong DVD,they miss advertised this as being Catch That Kid when it was the UK version Mission without Permission. can't playon DVD player.. now my kid is unhappy :(
2,Catch that crap,"A bad family movie. It's like Adventures in Babysitting meets The Italian Job. The movie is unrealiable, with bad acting, and a bad message."
5,THIS IS THE BEST!!!,This was the best movie that i have seen in a long time!!! I LOVED IT!!! if you havent seen it you need to go see it because it is really the best movie EVER and when it first started i thought it was way stupid but i ended up getting way into it!!!!
1,Morally Bankrupt,"I was suckered into getting this movie by its similarities to the movie ""Spy Kids"". While the action was fun, this movie sends lots of bad messages to kids. You spend the greater portion of the movie seeing the kids lie and steal. Not only from the ""large corporate entity"", but they also lie to one another. They pull dangerous stunts and run from police riding go-carts on city streets at night. In the big wrap-up, they get caught. Here I am waiting for the kids to learn that what they did was wrong. The mom barely shames them and then lies to police to get them out of trouble. In the end they are rewarded for their ""work"". Dad is saved and all is well, but at what cost? This movie had a terrible message."
1,Catch a cold instead,"If you think your children should be taught to rob from banks and lead the police on dangerous chases involving go-karts to pay your medical bills, then buy this DVD pronto. This uninvolvling thriller sparked only casual interest in my 9-year-old and repulsed me as her father. The plot hinges on adults acting very, very stupid, which I guess can occur, but come on. Give me ""Spy Kids"" any time."
1,What The Hell is this,"Dumb movie, boring movie,dont want to watch it, peaple dont get this movie it sux.."
1,I'm Ennoyed By Publicity,This is ridiculis(don't know if I spelt that right). This is(knowing the facts) a publicity stunt. This has the same plot as Spy Kids. I still can't believe in the new year we can't think up a new idea. People use your brain! Not all ideas are taken! Use your imagination and more people will buy tickets! So basicly it's Spy Kids with not all kids being related an there are three of them. Not a big difference.
4,A Good Movie,"Yeah, so maybe this is not the message you want to send to kids, but it is a movie. A good movie with a story behind it. Certaintly adults don't care much for it. ""They Shouldn't"" It's a kids movie. I recomend you watch is more than once before you judge it. Besides Its not like Children don't hear about theft on the news."
4,Extremely good. CD quality was not great. Rec. in 1935,"Never mind that it sounds like that the music was recorded in Casals' back yard, Casals still displays amazing tone an virtuosity. I wish that his genius could have been captured with todays technology."
5,From The Inside Flap:,"Christmas, 1940 was not a joyous time for most of the world. Britain was under constant air attack. Japan had occupied much of China and seemed poised for further aggression. And though America was at peace, she too would soon be drawn into a brutal world war.In that dark time almost fifty years ago, Eleanor Roosevelt wrote a story for Liberty Magazine about the meaning of Christmas. Set in Nazi-occupied Holland, Christmas 1940 is a tale about the simple, but susyaining faith of one family confronted with the evil force of the oppressor.Elliott Roosevelt writes in his introduction to this story that his mother's message to the downtrodden peoples of the world was ""Have Faith...have faith and do not despair. Freedom will again be yours.As uplifting as it was in 1940, Eleanor Roosevelt's beautiful, moving story will remind us all once again of the true meaning of Christmas."
2,This was my first Celeste...,"Bradley book and probably my last. I probably should not have read the series out of order but I am not sure it would have made a difference.I don't mind erotic prose but it did seem a bit out of place and almost too pornagraphic on the first two pages of the text. This kind of prose tends to occur after a few chapters (and character introductions) but I am sure it helps sell books with it so early on.I did not love the ""hero"" considering in the beginning he was pretty anti-female and then later after a few days of passion he then turns on the ""heroine"" for selfish gain. He then feels guilty but it is too late for me to really like him."
4,Good Book,"When I was younger I read only romantic novels and a list of just certain authors, but as I got older (63) and brought a Kindle the world is a new place. I read all types of books mystery, drama, suspense, and paranormal.This book is Good for a good read."
1,Poorly made tennis video,"I do not recommend this video, it is a waste of money! The video was made by an amateur, and is extremely unprofessional. It appears to have been made with someone's home video camera in a local park. Background noise, poor lighting, and an unscripted presentation all contribute the poor quality of this video. When I was deciding whether or not to buy it, I read some good reviews. Don't be fooled by these reviews, they were probably sent in by the video maker himself."
4,Tennis Time Beginning -6- lesson Tennis Series,"Thanks Walt, the beginning tape is great. You get all the rules and scoring, plus all the hits; the forehand, backhand and serve. Now when I finally take that group class I won't be so lost. And all six lessons on one tape really helps."
5,great bedtime book,"My 3 year old picked out this book in a store. I was a bit skeptical about just how this glow-in-the-dark technique would work and there was no way to find out until we brought it home to try it out.Sitting in a dark bedroom, armed with a latern, we discovered it works wonderfully.We read each page with only a latern as a light source. The text on each page was just long enough to allow the glow-in-the-dark figure or clue to ""charge."" Then, when we turned out the light, a glowing image appeared.This glow-in-the-dark book works great and is a favorite bedtime book.We are now searching for other books with this same concept.Grab your flashlight and try it."
2,It's agreat book with many interesting facts about the lads.,This is an okay book. I mean if a lady wants to write a book about somone she knows alot about then she should get all the facts straightend. Scott's birhtday is not the 27th of november its the 22nd. She has a lot of grammer mistakes too! Scott is my favorite lad from 5ive and I think everyone should know his right birthday.
2,Rather boring and irrelevant,"I love Five so muchh because of their music.They are very funny guys but its when they are doing interviews and stuff.Since this is just a bio on their lives it's rather boring.YEs there are a few good hilarious quotes, but their rare in comparison to the other 150 (or whatever it is) pages of blurr.Sorry their stories arent that interesting, theyre just everyday peple.I love Five thouGH AND MAY THEIR MUSIC LIVE ON FOREVER"
3,Outdated but Interesting,"This book was published in 1973, and it was written as a ""current events"" book, so it has little relevance for today's reader. At least, as far as current events go. The players, coaches, front office people and the owner are all long gone, either retired or deceased.However, it is still worth reading as a history book. You can learn a lot about the workings of the Red Sox, and read some of the stories that today's Sox fan may not have heard before. Most fans know that Boston may have had first crack at Jackie Robinson and Willie Mays, and those tales are relayed again here. But others, like the racism of the scouting department, or the way in which prospects advanced through the system, were new to me.I would say this book would interest only the diehard Red Sox fan, or a serious fan of baseball history in general. Others are likely to lose interest fairly quickly."
2,21 century behavior in 12 century time,"Pro's - the description of the surrounding is good, makes you feel like you are in medieval times.Con's - the behavior of the characters, practically 21st century (when the heroine leaves her 3 year old twins and 10 year old daughter at home, she first finds someone to watch over them...)Characters are VERY flat. Almost politically correct. Which is a shame as there was real potential there..."
4,A true picture of England in the 12th Century.,"While most historical romances make the Middle Ages almost TOO perfect, I liked the fact that the Love Knot didn't. It portrayed a knight that wasn't always shining and a lady who wasn't always dressed her very best and making great heartfelt choices. The hearth knight was a poor knight, who didn't have his own castle to live in. I really felt I was dropped in the Middle Ages without all the glamour, just the plain truth. They reminded me of everyday people. Thank you Ms. Chadwick!"
4,What a ride!,"I found this book to be a very good read. It has all of the things you want in a book. I liked the main characters a lot. It makes you feel your right in there seeing it all happen. Not may authors can do that but, this one can. 4 stars cause it didn't knock my socks off. LOL I would recommend this book to anyone who likes to read about knights and survival of the fittest or smartest."
1,Not so good,I needed practical info on how to recover after mental illness but this book half is about the author himself and half is about how the brain functions so not so good.
1,Worthless,"If you have Vista, do not buy this product. I bought this USB hub hoping it will add convenience to my new PC. As it turned out, it was a waste of time and money. First, it does not work with Vista. It has only one USB internal connector (4 pin) which does not supply the necessary power for the device. While I'm sure I tried every trick in the book, I could not get rid of the power error message.Second, part of the connection requires bringing a wire back out to the back of the PC, which is not only uncommon and impractical, it defeats the purpose of buying the device.If there were a Zero Star rating, I would have jumped on it."
2,Series Begins to Fall Flat,"The first three books move at a fairly good clip - with things really being handled well. Book Four kills that momentum halfway through its pages. Leaving a successful formula that is similar to a bad B-Rated Mystery-Thriller - the series takes a very preachy turn. Even after one removes the heavy-handed bully pulpit from the story - there's not much to be praise-worthy with what's left. The first three books focused on excellent character and plot development, and the preachy aspects took a deep backseat to those methodologies. Sorry Mr. Lahaye and Mr. Jenkins...your novel doesn't live up to the expectations of the first three in this series."
1,The worst written of the series,"This book starts off with a long scene about Rayford's uniform and the cost of its accoutrements which is among the worst pieces of writing I have ever encountered in fiction. And it went on for PAGES. From there it picks up a bit but keeps falling back into the kind of writing that would not make it through an undergraduate workshop. Some reviewers have complained that the books are becoming too character-driven. I don't mind that, except that the characters themselves are so shallow. The first rule of good writing -- show don't tell -- is violated on almost every page of this tedious book.I enjoyed Left Behind and have read the others as they were published out of curiosity. No big deal, it only takes a few hours to read each. But the writing, which was never really good, has become the worst sort of hack work."
2,Fiction-lite,"If you're in need of Sunday-school remedial lessons you may find something of value in these incredibly light-weight novelettes. Stretched out to garner as many sales as is feasably possible, each of these commercial exploitations is a very superficial and unsophisticated read. In contrast, read Glen Kleier's complex and spiritually satisfying supsense thriller THE LAST DAY and you will see how much gold can be mined from this rich topic of the End of Time. For my money, there has to be more to a novel than simply a validation of fundamentalist Bible interpretations. I'm also looking for a story, characterization, and theological insight. These books are very disappointing in that regard."
5,Can't Put it Down,"This is a wonderful series that I just can't seem to put down. I've read through six books in the series in just over a month. Yes these are fictional books, but they are based on biblical prophesy and it has, in an uncanny way, helped me to begin to understand the end times and why such a loving God would allow such turmoil and destruction. Even those who do not believe should read this series. It is action packed and will take you through all the emotions and bring you close to the characters. I will continue to read the series, as I am excited to read about The Glorious Appearing."
5,Gives one a sense of urgency to tell others about Christ,"A must read. The whole series gives one a real ""picture"" of what it might be like when the rapture happens. It brings home the truth that we need to be ready to meet Christ, and that we need to share Jesus every day!"
4,I enjoyed the book and I am looking forward to the next.,"I find the whole series fun to read. However, I find that the earlier books seem to be a little better written."
5,I have extremely enjoyed each of the four books.,"I have recently read all four books and I loved each one. I can't see where these people are getting that it is written on a grammar school level. Is it because there are no explicit language or vulgar thought-provoking scenes? I hardly feel that it was written on a school-age level. Being a school teacher, I should know. I do admit that ""Soul Harvest"" was a little drawn out. However, it was still very good. I have learned a lot through these books. I know that they are listed as fiction, but how true some of these exact things may become."
5,Best books I've ever read!!,"The attention to detail in this series is incredible. I felt as if I were right there with the charactors every step of the way. I cried with them, laughed with them, and most of all, rejoiced with them. I thank God that I will not be here to witness the tribulation first hand, but these books have given me a very real sense of the terror those who are ""left behind"" will have to face. I have given the first of this series to my father as a gift, praying that he will see the truth, and the Truth will set him free!!"
5,"outstanding, on the edge of your seat excitement","this book is as good or better then the first books in the series , it keeps you on the edge of your seat, rooting for ""Good""."
2,Decent message + poor writing does not = good book,"What a waste of a good plot. Is this the best that the Christian Sci-Fi genre can do. I certainly hope not. Shallow, unoriginal characters, poor attempts at humor, and pathetic dialogue mar what was a great idea for a series. Also, please jsut admit that these are 250 page books, not 400. One reason so many people think that they're flying through these books in 5 hours is because the books are only half as long as they seem. Ever wonder why there's so much space between lines?"
4,Excellent writing and character developement.,"I'm 13 years old and hadn't heard about the Left Behind: The Kids series, so I read these. I don't know how some of these people could write such terrible reviews of it! I'll admit that at the end it seemed like they wanted to get the first 3 or so Trumpet Judgements out of the way, like they were under a page limit or something, but I wouldn't rate it badly. I really liked the way the authors built up the characters in these books! I feel like they're my best friends now! The last hurried events really didn't seem the point of the book, so I didn't mind. I think that these books are some of my new favorites, and I think that Soul Harvest was a wonderful addition!"
3,"Good, But a diappointment","I found this book to be a very quick read. Not because it was so gripping but because I could skip 100 pages and not miss anything. While I found the first two books to be extremely good, the latest installments have been rather a let down. I was greatly disappointed to have read so much on the search for loved ones only to find at least three major world events crammed into the last chapters. surely these events if better covered would have inproved the reading of this book. Over all I must say Soul Harvest was a disappointment,and I hope the next will be better. If not the authors will lose a reader."
4,My Favorite,"This is my favorite book in the series thus far. The plot moves faster in my opinion and the characters are developed more. There is also a good combination of suspense of light comedy which makes it easier for those of us who read at night. Another plus is that it begins to show the true agony of those who will be left behind. This is one book definitely worth reading, but could go more in depth."
5,An outstanding chapter of the series...,"This fourth book of the Left Behind series really picked up the much needed pace that was slackened by Tribulation Force and the first half of Nicolae. It was a good 100 pages longer than Nicolae and ended abruptly. Can't write too much more, I have to get reading the next book!"
5,edge of your seat!,"each book gets better and better! this one takes us much deeper, introduces us to new characters that we grow to care about, reveals a few surprises and validates some of the things we were suspicious of. in rayfords belief that his wife was alive and his his will not to give up that belief until he was shown different, i was really able to bond with him. the same can be said of buck in his search for chloe. the ever changing, ever growing tribulation force has me (and a lot of others!) hooked! thankfully, i have my copy of assassins...ready to be devoured! ::smile"
5,Enjoying this one too!,This book is just as spell binding as the previous books in the Left Behind series. A good read and thought provoking book (series)! I can't wait to read more in the series!
1,Add this to list of Sunday School material,"This is an o.k. book/series . . . but only if you are looking for material for you elemantary age sunday school class. Why did they bother to release a series of these books specifically for kids when this series fits that age group so well already. The basic story line, the writing style, and the unrealistic human concepts in this book are perfect for children, as they should be the only people who actually believe this garbage. Don't get me wrong, the basic message here is the truth. The Rapture and the Tribulation Period events that may occur at any time in the near future. Beyond that, however, very little in this book is plausible, let alone realistic. I give it an ""A"" for concept, and an ""F-"" for everything else. Unfortunately, that averages out into a big ol' whomppin ""F"" in my book."
1,Slow.,"Not as interesting as the others. I find myself wanting the series to hurry up and get over with, and not because I'm interested in spending time with the characters. It's just getting tedious, and I want to be put out of my misery."
4,Soul Harvest,"Soul Harvest: The World Takes Sides (Left Behind, Book 4 - Book was in great condition. I like that the authors only give a little recap of the previous books rather than retell the whole story."
5,Best books ever,i am 13 years old and i am a christian and these books have all the truth . God will come again and these are such a great way to put how sad it will be so don`t take your time thinking about God he is so much greater then that he loves you and these books show that!!!
3,Mr. Lahaye and Mr. Jenkins continue to hold my attention.,"I enjoyed reading Soul Harvest, as I did with the first three books. However, I was very disappointed with the ending. Too much was left until the end and then jammed in. I was sorry there wasn't more time with Rayford sharing his loss over Amanda. I would like to see fewer major events happen and more detail on those that do."
3,A disappointment after the *Nicolae* cliffhanger.....,"I have read all four in the series and have found each one to diminish in intensity. I read the first three books in just 2 weeks and was anxiously awaiting *Soul Harvest*, only to find it a filler to bridge the gap to book #5. I understand the significance of a seven book series, however, it is obviously a stretch. Mr. LaHaye could have cut out 150 pages right out of the middle of *Soul Harvest* and not skipped a beat. I read it in 5 days only because I know I will need the background for book 5. Hopefully Mr. LaHaye will submit a ""leave you on the edge of your seat"" installment next time or he may lose some readers before the series is concluded."
2,Not Good enough,"Even though the entire Left Behind series suffers from underdeveloped characters and anbolutely unbelievable dialogues, the istallments that came before Soul Harvest were a good read if only just because of non-stop suspence and action... This book, unfortunately, lacks both almost entirely. Even though this is a must-read for those that are intent on finishing the series, if this book stood on it's own I would recommend that the reader spend that money on something more worthy of his/her time."
1,Tribulation perils advance at a snails pace.,"I really liked Left Behind, but the subsequent books in the series are definitely lagging. Although there is lots of action in Soul Harvest, I found the plot simple. Worse it moves at a ponderous pace. There was less biblical support for this book than prior efforts. The biggest disappointment is the lack of closure at the ending. You could skip this book and probably not miss anything in the series."
2,THE MOST BORING IN THE SERIES,"Please don't get me wrong, I love this series and it is what got me into reading the Bible after a 25 year lapse! For that, I am extremely grateful and I will continue to read this series, HOWEVER. I am sorry to say, I found this book very boring. Most of it consists of a search conducted by Rayford and Buck for their loved ones lost in the Wrath of the Lamb earthquake. It seemed to me the series had reached a standstill, and I was bored. The ostensibly ""thrilling"" parts, like Buck's rescue of Chloe from the hospital left me cold, wanting more interpretation of Scripture, and less ""thrills"". I wish the authors would get back on track, and quit wasting my time and money. I feel like this book was just a holding pattern to keep me interested while they write something really worthwhile and instructional. Please, Tim and Jerry, more Bible and less ""thrills""!"
2,"Necessary to read for the series, but reading was boring.","This book could have been written in one third the space it actually took up. Plot dragged and repeated far too many scenes from the previous books - seemingly to fill the required number of pages. I highly respect these two authors and hope they develope enough plot to 'fill the pages' of the next in the series. Yes, of course I'll buy it and give them another chance. Can't seem to find my other books in the series though... they are being passed around continuously to non-believers."
1,blah blah blah,"Get it over with already. I don't mind it when authors stretch out a book/series a little but only if the authors stretch it using interesting filler (character backgrounds, cultural quirks, tons of detail) but these guys are wasting too much time with drivel. Really smelly gooey stinky drivel. Oh wait, I just described the book. This series was a great idea, no doubt about it. It has a solid message and started off fairly strong. It could have been not only a classic piece of literature, but also a marvelous tool for converting many people missing Christ. Oh well, at least they're trying. Apparently not too hard though."
2,A wasted effort,"If you're reading the series, read the first few pages and the last few pages of this book and skip the rest. Move on to book 5. You won't miss a thing.It seems the authors are trying to stretch this series for far more than it's worth. None of the books are terribly well written but this was the worst by far. The story line crawls along though there is almost no character development through this installment.This book should have been a chapter in the preceeding or subsequent books in the series. Usually a paragraph was enough to get me to sleep each night."
1,Cheesy and laughable.,"The lame plot in this series is just pathetic. Here's an example: The Antichrist develops a worldwide cell phone network run by solar power. It's called Cellular Solar, or Cell-Sol for short. Get it? ""Sell soul."" Ha, ha, very funny.If that's the best attempt at humor LaHaye and Jenkins can come up with, spare us the rest of the series and just wrap it up now. Don't prolong our agony. Just nuke the world already and get it over with."
4,Getting better,"With SOUL HARVEST LaHaye and Jenkins have finally hit their stride. The fourth of the Left Behind series, this book combines the catastrophes of Revelation with some action, intrigue, and even some really interesting minor characters.The major characters are finally presented with some real problems (other than the major problem of being left behind), some real struggles, some real disappointments, and some new friends. This book introduces us to the excellent characters of Ken Ritz, maverick charter pilot, and Mac McCallum, co-pilot on the Antichrist's personal jet, and a few others.The story is consistently interesting in this book, and the outcomes of all the situations are not predictable. I look forward to reading the rest of the series, and recommend it to those who want a series of fast-reading and diverting books."
3,"Interesting, but&#65533;","""Left Behind,"" (the series,) was an easy read, with an also too easy to follow plot. I preferred Jerry Furland's view of a more realistic turn of future events in his novel, ""Transfer: The end of the beginning."" It has a more believable scenario, is less opinionated, and is more intelligently written than ""Left Behind."" ""Transfer"" left me wanting more, and thankfully there is-it is the first novel of a trilogy. I recommend it highly!"
5,Excellent exciting story,I have read all four of the books that are out and it is a very exciting story. If it were fiction or turn out not to be fiction it holds your attention. I would like to know when the next books in the series are to be published.
4,Good...but needs more detail,This series has a lot of action in it and suspense centering around the Tribulation. I enjoyed this book due to the suspense level it had in it. Searching for their loved ones...Buck and Rayford start becoming more of a nuisance to the Antichrist. Carpathia is finally losing his patience toward the end of the novel with the prophecies in Revelation becoming fulfilled. However...one disappointing factor to this work was little detail and not much time spent on the beginning of the Trumpet Judgements...especially the second and third ones.
4,"Slower than the previous books, a little confusing",This book is not quite up to par with the other books in the series. It reads slower and is more confusing because of the jumping around.Still conforms to Revelations.
5,Outstanding continuation of a wonderful series!,"Left Behind was suggested to me by my mother-in-law. Since our tastes in books are drastically different, I was hesitant. But WOW! What a series. This has captured my attention like no other series I have ever read. It is better than Asimov's Foundation series!! Praise the Lord for writers like these two that know how to teach and entertain at the same time. GOD BLESS YOU BOTH!!"
2,The authors sell their souls to harvest some cash.,"While I'm not one to rank the Left Behind series among my alltime favorites, it has been an enjoyable read. Until now, that is.Soul Harvest is a disappointing filler that seems more an effort to cash in on the series' overall success than an integral part of the story. Whether or not the authors planned to expand the series to 7 books from the start I don't know, but it would appear that they have decided to take a good thing too far. More time and dialogue goes into deciding whether or not to open the briefcase of a dead man than the anti-climactic judgements of God rained down upon the earth. Where I put down Nicholae eager to devour the next installment, after finishing Soul Harvest I feel empty, a little cheated and only mildly curious about what comes next."
5,The shattered Trib Force attempts to reunite,"Soul Harvest is easily one of the most memorable entries in the Left Behind series. It picks up from the cliffhanger in Nicolae, with the Tribulation Force (and the world) in chaos and searching for missing loved ones. SH includes the introduction of some memorable characters, Leah Rose and Doc Charles, the painful searches of Ray and Buck for their wives, and the discovery of a new safe house.I can easily recommend Soul Harvest as one of my favorites in the Left Behind series."
1,When is anything ever going to happen?,"The series was based on an intriguing topic, but the author took so disgustingly long to say anything the only thing left in the series was suspense, and the only suspense was: WHEN IS ANYTHING EVER GOING TO HAPPEN??"
4,Soul Havest:: The World Takes Sides,Soul Harvest was in good condition and had little damage. The pages were a little worn and the cover was worn.
3,Slow Moving,This story is slow moving. But you keep reading in hopes that something will turn around and it will get moving. I read it because I had read the ones before and wanted to know how the story ends. Even at the end of the book you don't know how the story ends and you are hoping that the next book will move a bit faster.The earthquake is the only big event that happens in the story. Which may be why it the story seems to move so slow.
5,My Favorite Of The Series!,"Soul Harvest is one of the most moving books I have ever read. It touches the heart of Christianity; the reason Jesus was sent to earth. I found everything about this fourth book in the series to be pleasant. It was like reading a letter from a family member (one you actually love) or a good friend. It has been years since I first read this novel, but still remember its original impact: motivation to seek the face of God like never before. Let's fact it - these novels are about leading people to Christ...they do their job well."
5,Excellent series,"I highly recommend this series. Each book walks you through a ""last days"" scenario using Revelation as a guide. It really makes you think about your personal relationship with God."
4,Soul Harvest E book,Enjoyed the book and the series alot - This is the rest of the text to make sure I have at least twenty characters because Amazon has this stupid rule for leaving feedback. This will be the last time that I leave feedback.
5,Soul Harvest,I am enjoying the book. I somehow missed this one when reading the series. It was nice to be able to order the book and recieve it so quickly.
3,"Fascinating topic, average writing","Don't read these novels after reading good fiction like Sophie's Choice, The Last Day, The Triumph and the Glory, or Catcher in the Rye, Jenkins and LaHaye suffer in the comparison. I'm all for the idea of spreading the gospel because we need all the we can get in these times, and I'm a believer, but one shouldn't confuse support for these books with support for Christ. Many people liked Left Behind, and even Tribulation Force, but let's be honest here, these last couple efforts have been feeble works of fiction. I've posted my e-mail address above if anyone cares to try and persuade me I've missed something in Nicolae and Soul Harvest."
5,Get ready for some more trumpet blasts!,"This series of books has been so inspiring to me. How comforting it is to know that my hope is secure in Christ Jesus, and that I don't have to worry about the tribulation. However, it should also spur us on as Christians to witness to others and share the gift that has been so freely given to us. I encourage you all to think about things in terms of eternity. The friendships that you have matter nothing if you are unwilling to share Christ with those around you. Pray for boldness and conviction in spreading the Good News. May God bless you all."
4,after the earthquake,"The fourth book in the series follows the main characters as they recover from the aftermath of the global earthquake. Rayford is trying to confirm if Amanda was on a plane that crashed into the Tigris River, while Buck desperately tries to find a wounded Chloe before GC officials find her first. I appreciate any light-heartedness or humor that the authors write into these books, since the content is naturally often dark and forboding. The funniest scene in the series so far occurs in this book, as Buck and his friend Ken Ritz - wounded and drugged - pull off a hospital rescue with more than a few glitches. While the book moves along at a good pace, I still found it incredible that the majority of the book covered such a short amount of time, just a few weeks. Looking forward to reading the next book."
5,Excellent set of books,This set of books by Tim Lahaye and Jerry Jenkins is one of the best sets of books that I have read in a long time. My wife and parents also love the series and it seems that none of us can hardly wait for the next one in series.
4,Soul Harvest,"Again, couldn't put it down. I'm on book # 6 now, and for the first time, it has taken me more than 4 days to finish."
1,The Unchristian Adventure,"Although Biblicly based, the Left Behind series of which I have now read the first three, celebrate white male supremacy (the protagonists are Buck Williams and Rayford Steele) and they demonize foreigners ( the antichrist is named Carpathia from Romania and his number two man is named Leon Fortunato). The women in the story although Christian are wives, lovers, secretaries etc. There are no female heroes so far. Hattie Durham, the blonde bombshell who almost hit it off with Rayford Steele is pregnant with the child of the antichrist and since abortions are not a possibility with this group I am curious as to how L&J deal with this issue.This is an action adventure series and L&J provide the necessary tension to keep you guessing. It is however written at about the 8th grade level so you will not need a dictionary."
2,Why are there all these 5 star ratings?,"This series should have been written in 2 or 3 books. The authors repeat the same tales over and over! How many people does Ray have to tell about his ""almost"" infidelity? I have begged a friend to tell me what happens. I am interested in the outcome, but I just don't think I can take any more of these books. Seems like the authors are filling up space to make money on more books. If you are smart, you will never read the first one!"
5,This book was totally awesome!,"This book was as stimulating and thought provoking as the others. I've enjoyed all six books in the series and can't wait for the seventh one to come out. If you ever tried to interpret the book of Revelations, this could be it! I highly recommend this book to everyone (along with the first three). They're very exciting (and sometimes very scary!). I would suggest reading them in order starting with ""Left Behind"" so it will make more sense when you get to this one which is number four in this awe inspiring series. Tim LaHaye and Jerry Jenkins are wonderful authors."
3,The Phantom Pulp.,"Ah, Christian Pulp Fiction. It had been nearly two years since I last left off reading this series. I really hadn't missed much. SOUL HARVEST starts off where NICOLAE ended. The world is in utter chaos as a worldwide earthquake has devastated the entire globe. Buck and Rayford spend most of the book pulling James Bond type stunts in attempts to find their missing wives. Tsion Ben Judah is preaching to the world via the internet and Carpathia, even though he is supposed to be the Antichrist, seems clueless a lot of the time. The worldwide catastrophes that plague the Earth are skimmed over as they happen or are referred to in passing.I was looking forward to reading this after NICOLAE. However, I'm afraid the series peaked with that book. You know how things are going to end and I'm afraid the authors aren't going to explain much about how the planet gets there. Still, SOUL HARVEST is better than TRIBULATION FORCE. Not too bad Christian pulp fiction."
5,How wonderful,"I have read some of the other reviews on this book and I believe this is one of the best series of books I have read to date. I make no apologies, I would re-read. Keep going Tim & Jerry. Please write more!"
2,"Contrived, transparent melodrama","What a waste of time. I love books about epic events and global crises, but after surviving the torture of reading a comic book level plot like Jenkins has tossed our way with Soul Harvest,I think I'll stick to GOOD books like ""The Triumph and the Glory"" or ""Schindler's List""."
1,The series has turned into kids' books,"The series started out very well, but with each new addition it has gotten weaker and weaker. The writing level has recessed to the point of a kid book. I was very dissapointed with Nicolae, yet decided to check Soul Harvest out just to see if I could get a little closure. I'm almost sad to say that Soul Harvest was the first book I never bothered to finish. Poorly written, it jumps from topic to topic, ignores some important issues, and spends way too much time on issues with no bearing. Am I disappointed? Yes, but only b/c I let myself get my hopes up prematurely. Oh well."
3,LOVED the last 3...but was a little let down by this one,"Absolutely loved the previous 3 books but agree with other reviewers that this one didn't quite measure up. The whole ""Amanda"" thing was a little unbelievable and unnecessary. One thing this series does do is remind us how precious time is and that we should be about the Father's work. Whether you are a pre, mid, or post-tribulation believer makes no difference. The fact remands that without Christ you are doomed no matter when or how it plays out. If these books do nothing else they get you thinking about that."
1,400 pages of dribble then 3 major events in 1 chapter.,"I have read the authors' first 3 books of the ""Left Behind Series"" and had been looking forward to the release of Soul Harvest. I must say that I was very disappointed with the story of Soul Harvest. 400 pages were spent with no major events. (except the sign on the foreheads, that was cool). The search for Chloe and Amanda way to long. What I could not understand is how could the book end the way it did. The authors dribble about not much for 400 pages and then conclude 3 major events in the last chapter (2 major events in just 2 pages). I would rather have been hanging with the book ending just before the first meteor hit. So much was tied in the last few pages that it was completely unbelievable. Then it ends with Rayford and Nichloae talking as though its business as usual. (Come on guys I know you can do better then this. ) I will continue to follow the story but I can not recommend ""Soul Harvest""Roger Saurage"
2,"Terrible, slow, and WAY too preachy.","I've long been enamored with apocalyptic literature; something about a world slowly dying simply captivates my interest. So I was excited to hear of the Left Behind series.The problem, however, is that the series gradually turns into more of an evangelizing text than a quality novel. Long, boring religious asides take up pages at a time while major apocalyptic events are expressed in merely a few paragraphs. Three trumpet judgements seemed to breeze through in mere pages.While I enjoyed the first three books of the series, Soul Harvest seems to be sending it down a slippery slope, degenerating into a long religious tract. At the moment, I am reading Apollyon (book #5), and find it just as slow paced. However, I continue to read in hopes that it will pick up."
2,sorely disappointing . . .,"The only readers who will come away satisfied with this series (I quit halfway through ""Soul Harvest"") are fundamentalist who can't get enough of the same ol' fire and brimstone. These books are the shallowest of shallow, with about as much intellectual stimulation as a bowl of cold oatmeal. There are vastly more exciting and fearsome novels on the subject of The Last Day--not the least of which is the novel by the same name--""The Last Day."" If you have the mental wherewithal for a really scary spiritual ride, ""The Last Day"" delivers a story of unsurpassed suspense and controversy. If you just like to sit back and veg out, stick with this juvenile ""Left Behind"" stuff!"
2,sloooooooooooooooow...,"This book just drags on and on. Buck's search for Chloe could have been handled in a fraction of the time.One huge gripe, which represents incredibly poor writing, is the name changes used to refer to one character. Ken Ritz is both referred to as Ken and Ritz, and not just in dialogue either. One rule of good writing is to ALWAYS refer to your character by one name. You wouldn't refer to a mother as Jane, mum, mother and ma in the one book.Still, the book can be quite entertaining if you know what's coming next, which you would because it's been mentioned enough in the books. One more thing that bothers me is recapping on past events-- the authors rehash the same old stuff."
3,Exciting,The decription of the global earth quake was one of the most compelling aspects of this book. I liked it because it gave a pictorial description of one of the most mind boggling events in the future. It was not quite as dramatic as that depicted in the non-fiction book Eden to Armageddon but it was representative of our future destruction on a much smaller scale.
2,Writers: Please return to your previous focus on Scriptures,"The element that has made these books successful is the way apocalyptic scripture is woven into modern life -- it's definitely not the goings-on of the characters. I could not believe the authors devoted almost 420 pages of character ""development"" and then gave the first three Trumpet Judgements a mere 4-5 pages at the end of the book. (I think the Wormwood comet that poisons a third of all water was covered in 3 paragraphs.) Come on guys, how the judgements impact the survivors after the Rapture is your story -- not how Rayford thinks he can find evidence of his wife's end on a plane at the bottom of a river (is it that even remotely pausible?)."
2,"I wish I could do it, but . . .","I really wish I could look past the poor writing, shallow characters, and weak story line to see the valuable message hidden within these books, but I just can't. There are too many other, better, Christian novels out there for me to waste time fighting through such poor pieces of work. This wasn't the worst book I've ever read, but it's close.I'd give it 1 1/2 stars if I could."
5,Great Book,I purshesed it for my husband. It has helped him with his studies. I have yet to read it. However I highly recomened it for none believers.
3,Going slower towards the end,Like the series but it seems each book covers a little less time and more scriptures which sometimes I don't mind but makes the story move slower
5,Very effective!,"We tried several infant gas drops for our little one, and these are undoubtedly the BEST. They work instantly, have non-staining formula unlike [pink] Mylicon, and have a pleasant taste and aroma unlike [store] brand. Our daughter actually preferred the taste of Little Tummys over any other gas relief medicine, and we could swear that these drops work faster than anything. Little Tummys are also the best value - the Mylicon is 1,5 times more expensive."
5,She wanted them...,I purchased this for my best friend who requested for it on her baby registry. She likes it so much after her first child that she did not want to be without it for her second child.
1,Not effective according to studies,"I ordered this product, but I have read in more than one book that these drops have been proved ineffective. The control group was given water and it worked just as well. It makes you feel so much better as a parent to be doing something... but check out the studies. Unfortunately this product does not work.The saline drops sold by the same company are good, however."
3,Another Crue Compilation (Track Listing),"The album has a hodgepodge of Crue songs and demos. If you're looking for a more comprehensive best of, you're better off withRed White & Crue: 2 CD Edition. But this is an interesting B-Sides collection for the Crue connoisseur.1.

3,Describes typical life in a Ramakrishna Center,"The author was an active member of a Ramakrishna Vivekananda Center in California. He describes the activities of that center from a cultural anthropologist's point of view. Unfortunately he has to to hide any actual references to people there, like for protecting himself from law suits or personal disadvantages within that center. Therefore the book seems to be rather artificial. The lengthy anthropological introduction wants to rise the level of the book, but following chapters do not fully utilize anthropology. So it's neither a real scientific book, nor an exciting real-life story. On the other hand, any book which helps to analyze religious groups is helpful."
1,Where's the quality?!,"Bought this with great expectations because 1. My family loves Melissa & Doug & 2. All the rave reviews. It arrived promptly as expected via Amazon Prime, but I'll be returning it in the morning. Honestly it looks like it was stitched together in the dark. The face is lopsided & elongated, it has long white threads (the ones that stitch the limbs on) hanging out everywhere, the nose has a spot that is shaved bare, & it's missing an eyebrow!! Bummed because this was supposed to be THE Santa present for my 2 year old."
3,My mini schnauzer got a friend to play with,"I am 33 and finally got my first dog, a mini schanuzer. He loves to play and so I decided to get him a stuffed version of himself. He's around 8 lbs now and when the box came, I opened it and the plush was 2x as big as he was. I had to comb out the hair a bit as it was matted (somewhat)."
3,"Interesting, but lacking in presentation and theory.","I give this book 3 stars because of its dense amount of information and its potential to be a landmark book in the field of entheogens and religion. This book, however, reads more like an encyclopedia of anthropological eras, than anything else. The book has no introduction, and no conclusion, and no thesis to tie any of it together. The book is ultimately a hodge podge of information waiting for somebody to make some sense of it. In this regard it may be a good resource, but it offers little else. I hope that the author will at least go back and add an introduction to this book so that the readers will at least know what his purpose in writing it was."
3,I LUV DIS SONG!!!!!!!!,i really think this song is a true garage tune i luv it!!! if eny1 has the lyrics 2 this song plz email me coz i have been lookin 4 them everywere!!!!!!!! lara_1593@hotmail.co.uk thx xxxxxxxxxxxxxx mwah mwah xxxxxxxxxxxx luvin dis tune BRApPpPpPpPpPpPpPpPpPpPpPpPpPpPpPpPp xXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxX
1,Bad All Around,"Yes, it's sad that hateful words were spray painted on the VW, but this documentary was pretty bad. Mr. MVP and I agreed it was all about Erin's search for her 15 minutes of fame and she seemed to be really enjoying herself. At the point when the graffiti had been removed from the window and Erin actually reapplied it, that was when she lost both of us. This is the real world, fix the car, move on with life and make a dent in the world by donating time to established causes. (Hulu I think has this as a free watch instead of buying a copy.)"
4,Jewelry Ancient to Modern,The previous review I posted for this book was actually intended for the book of the same title written by Garside. Sorry.
2,Disappointed,"The Little Match Girl. You were quite accurate that the illustrations in the book were not the same as the ones shown. The ""catoonish"" drawings take away from this otherwise beautiful story. This is only item in which I have been disappointed in my purchases from Amazon. Will there ever be another ""Little Match Girl"" with the beautiful illustrations?"
4,Fairy Tales are not of Walt Disney,"Their from authors who teach us the truth. Only Disney changes them and makes all the endings happy. Happily Ever After-that is a fairy tale all in itself. I read this when I was 6 or so. I felt said for her too like every one else did. I tried to save a dumped kitty in this horrible snow storm. I don't think she made it so I bought this book to comfort me. I'm 42 and when it snows I imagine the older sick people with hypothermia and a late bill for heat. That is creul. I think that this book makes you understand death is not cruel, the people are. Death is a better place to be, rejoiced and released of suffering. I think it should be for teens. Not for anyone younger, a good way to start to learn sympathy and empathy. You can not deny this happens."
4,A great story,"Of course, the story is touching, to be expected. Didn't love the illustrations. But, they were fine."
1,Can't believe this is considered a classic... not for children,"(SPOILER) I know a lot of people disagree, but I feel this book is totally inappropriate for young children. If you want your children to be compassionate, there are much better ways to accomplish that in a positive way. Let them help at a local food bank, read about hardship in another country, send a gift to someone less fortunate.But don't lead them into the dark world of an abused little girl who was tormented, starved and left in the snow to die by her father. This could easily give a child nightmares and impress these horrific images in their little, impressionable minds. We have the responsibility of what we expose them to. I sure wouldn't expose them to stories like this one, regardless of whether it's a ""classic."" I guess it's fine for older kids and adults, but there are too many other great books to read."
1,This is not for children,"My daughter was given this on her 6th birthday. We always read to our children before they go to bed. This is not a bad book, in fact i think its a good book. The problem i have is that it is not appropriate for children, in my opinion. The book ends with the little girl lighting her last match, then dying in the cold night. At that point, am i supposed to say ""good night and sweet dreams"" to my duaghter?"
1,the little match girl,I found this book sad. The girl is forced to go outside in the cold to try and sell fake flowers and matches. She has to stay out all night in fear of her father. It has good color ard drawings. I don't think it makes a good childrens book because most kids wouldn't understand whats happening to her. The book takes up good time.Mark C
1,Unacceptable grammatical error,"Since this book is meant to be read out loud to small children, and since it's a children's book, it should not contain any serious grammatical errors. Somehow, the translator and the copyeditor missed this one: ""The next morning, the girl was found laying silently in the snow."" As I'm sure most educators know, except the person who reviewed the book for School Library Journal, the sentence should read ""... lying silently in the snow.""This error is unacceptable. Copyeditors should have caught it. To me, it's a sign that this is a poor edition of the classic story."
4,"Works great, but I like the original Tacky Glue better","I do a good amount of crafts and have been using Tacky Glue for almost 10 years. It works great. But the original Tacky Glue sometimes dries opaque and not clear, which is not ideal for certain projects. So, I was thrilled to see a clear gel version. I think the original version glues a little better, but this version does it job."
3,Ehhhh,I haven't seen much of a difference between this and the Elmer's glue my son uses for projects. Not impressed.
2,fixed blade knife,Great value and nice design. Nice build quality.... metal strength unknow at this time.
3,do all your clothes look like mohair blends? time to buy...,"if your pet has fur and sheds, you need this. seriously. your not going out like that, are you?"
4,Eric Wyse Christmas carols,"The CD was beautiful. I bought it for background music at a holiday party. It was perfect for that, but enjoyed listening to it at home all through the season."
4,Fantastic,"I thought this book was fantastic (obviously). You really get onto the emotional rollercoaster that Molly rides while during her time in The Hormones. It made me laugh, smile, cry, and jump up and down, wishing I could be Molly and just start my own band. This book makes you stop and think that nothing is stupid, and anything is possible."
5,I Love This Book So MUCH!!!!!!!!!!!!!,i loved this book. it helped me realize the problems of having a band and then again how much fun it would be. molly is a teenage girl just trying to get noticed and it works but her manager sucks. she loves a guy and he loves her. its so realistic and fantasy or anything and thats whats so good about it.sarra manning tells it like it goes out there and its truthfull. this book is my fave!
4,actually pretty good,"when i saw this book at the library i expected some stupid teenager book. you know the ones, where oh my god seems to be the only thing the main character sais. but this book actually rose above my expectations. the main character was likeable, and the ending was good. well i thought so at least. i wouldn't buy this book, but i would try reading it."
3,Wasn't the best book ever...,"I have to say, I was mostly attracted to this book because of the cover, and the fact that it had something to do with a girl being in a band. Shows how wrong I could be...this book had a good storyline (despite the many spelling errors), but it just seemed too unrealistic for my liking. To me it was like some fan fiction story people write on the internet about their favorite celebrities. I also didn't like the fact that it took place in London and was written with the same slang and dialouge. Maybe it was because I couldn't relate, but I give this book 3 stars."
4,My cats love this stuff,"I own two cats with very different tastes in food and treats. This is the only thing they both eat and they love it!It's a little messy as the flakes will eventually disintegrate into a powder - and it can be expensive depending on where you buy it (my local pet store charges $8 for 1/2 an ounce, ouch!) but my cats beg for it daily and it's sure way to get their attention."
5,A small price to pay for making our cat this happy!,"These were bought as somewhat of a gag Christmas gift for our cat....As it turns out, she absolutely loves them! (A friend's dog also loves them) We give them to her as a daily snack and she will sit in front of the cabinet where they're kept, begging for more. It's a small price to pay for making her this happy!"
5,Unquestioningly THE classic work on the Holy Spirit,"If you are seeking to understand the application of the Holy Spirit's power, holiness, and guidance in your personal Christian character and witness, then this is the book for you. Not only does Torrey take the reader through the Scriptures to define the person and work of the Holy Spirit, but he also guides the reader through the steps of personal application in their own lives. However, this work is not for the timid or young believer. If you are a fully devoted follower of Christ and ready for the next step, then buy this book now."
3,Generally Useful Book,"I've found this book to be useful with the beginning probably more useful than the end. If anyone has had their belief in the Trinity challenged, and they aren't sure how to defend that the Holy Spirit is real and does have a personality, then you might want to read this book."
5,The Person and Work of the Holy Spirit,"An excellent book on the Holy Spirit. Purchased one for my pastor and he, too had only good things to say about it. This book draws you to the Holy Spirit in such a wonderful way. Would be very interesting and helpful to any one seeking to experience a closer understanding of the Holy Spirit as the third PERSON of the trinity."
5,The Person and Work of The Holy Spirit,"It is a great book to read to help It help in a closer walk with the Lord. This book will open your eyes and teach you things you probly have not thought about.Makes you think on things in a difrent ways, and to be thinkful for the Holy Spirit."
3,marty62,"This book was interesting. I cant say I really believe in the baptistism of the Holy Spirit. The author gives a good argument for it,even though he didnt convince me.The book is worth reading, if you belong to a church that believes in this authors point of view."
1,The person and work of the holy spirit,I expected more out of this book. I found it repeated it's self on some topics. I really got board with it.
5,Very readable,"This book by R.A. Torrey is a breeze to read and deep in content. He gives a very orderly account of the Biblical discription of the Holy Spirit in a style that captivates the reader. For being an older book I expected an outdated book, but this book is current as the Holy Spirit never changes. I highly recommend The Person and Work of the Holy Spirit to everyone."
4,Essential for People Wanting More Knowledge of God,"A good read, lots of great information in a short book. The language is a bit dated, but it is an import work for anyone who is seriously seeking a better understanding of the Holy Spirit, and how he/she can profit from a closer walk with Him."
4,"No School, like Old School","In a time where young go to the clubs and parties to see to see what someone else is wearing or to get wasted, its good to know that music such as Freddie Jackson's can still be had. There is still nothing like you and your sigificant other, soft lights, two people sharing the moment with soft, slow, soulful music by artist like Freddie Jackson."
4,Great-looking storage,"Dresses up the office, and does the job. I'll keep purchasing these, in multiple colors. Perfect for my husband's papers and more."
5,Hitachi compound miter saw,"I bought this saw to build two kitchens with the aid of a professional carpenter. This saw is great. The carpenter loved this saw enough to leave his at home. I have use it and the miters are great. It is the best miter saw I have ever used, and my two kitchens are perfect thanks to a good saw and a good carpenter."
1,Poor Quality/Poor Customer Service,"My Hitachi saw has been disappointing. More disappointing is the lasck of Customer Service at Hitachi and their servicing dealer. The first saw had a nut drop out of the blade area and jammed the blade...on the first cut. Lowe's was kind enough to replace it. The second saw had the fences break. They blew out across the garage. Thankfully away from me. The Servicing dealer contacted Hitachi, who approved the warranty repair. I drove a long way to take it in to only get a call back saying Hitachi wouldn't honor the warranty. I have called Hitachi Customer Service 3 times; no return call."
2,Hitachi C12LDH,The delivery from amazon was prompt. The problems started when I tried to set up the saw for use. One of the flip out fences would not line up right. I found that the fence was twisted. I tried to get a hold of customer service at Hitachi to see if I could get the fence replaced. After 2 e-mails I finally received a customer service number. This was the last time that I heard from them even though I tried to connect with them again with the customer service number. I finally just ordered the part online so that I could use the saw. Amazon was great. Hitachi's customer service was not.
4,Hitachi - What are you waiting for?,"I've used an 8 1/2"" sliding compound saw professionally as a trim carpenter for many years and have been hoping the Hitachi 10"" sliding would get the fine digital feature on this 12"" - or that this 12"" would now go a little further and incorporate the soft start/ and brake features in the 10"" motor --- it is really nice you've added the dual bevel so please don't get me wrong.Now come on Hitachi, you'll really make us proud when you bring all these great features together - in asliding and a chop version! Until then I'm hoping to hold out with this old reliable friend, my 8 1/2"" Hitachi. Anyway, thanks Hitachi and here's to the future upgrades I know your elves are working on..."
4,Great Saw,"Much like everyone else I did my research before purchasing and even though the reviews were good I was a little skepical about a brand that I had never used before. Boy was I wrong. This saw is great! Lots of power, easy to use, came almost set up out of the box. I did not have any troubles with broken pieces as others have reported (maybe they have got that fixed). The fence is a little short when flipped open to do bevel cuts but that should be ok since the double bevel will allow you to lay pieces flat while cutting instead of upright. The only other things about the saw is to make sure to get a nice 60 or more tooth blade and probably a stand when buying. The stands will save you space unless you have a huge work area and most have extendable supports which you will need with this saw unless you are cutting something shorter than 2'. This is a great saw and to think that with other brands you would have to spend hundreds more for the same features."
2,I wanted to like this book,"but in the end I put it down three-quarters finished. The premise is good, ""Women's Pilgrimages To Sacred Places"", and a few of the sections made me want to visit the sacred spaces mentioned. Where the book's strength should be but where it falls apart is it isn't written by professional authors, but everyday women on a personal journey. The chapter's gripping excitements range from 'sweet and naive native children appearing with magic mushrooms' to derogating the gifts left by other visitors...what makes one person's vision wrong and someone else's right?Uneven and in the end, uninteresting. I bought the book for Chesca Potter's entry because I enjoy her art so much. Should have saved my money."
3,Doesn't Work for Me,"Hunter, Season Three is selling for the same price as Season One and Two.The first two seasons were single-sided DVDs, season three has gone to the double-sided disk.The producer of the Hunter series has increased his profit margin and the consumers, may suffer--I don't have much faith in the quality of double side disks.Follow-up--I was watching the ""Crossfire"" episode and lost the sound.I won't buy anything else on double-sided DVD."
2,Syndicated Episodes,"This set of ""Hunter"" included my favorite episode, 'The Cradle Will Rock', guest starring Chaka Khan. I was very disappointed to find out these are the syndicated episodes and not the full and complete episodes that originally aired on NBC. Therefore, some of the scenes have been edited out of several of the episodes."
4,"Mindless, Shameless, Fun","Hunter was one of the last successful crime show television series that did not try to be an accurate (or more accurate than normal)police procedural.Former LA Rams football player Fred Dryer plays Rick Hunter, a tough-as-nails LA homicide detective partnered with DeeDee McCall, an undercover specialist.The two were as Mutt and Jeff as you can get, and the plots and acting could be downright silly, but it was a fun and entertaining graduate of the Aaron Spelling school of crime drama, and as such, it has its own intrinsic value which is one judged properly by the common TV viewer, not highbrow TV critics who would recommend program that Hunter fans wouldn't watch it they were paid to do so.It's nice to have this series available on DVD."
4,Quick and Fun Learning Activities for 1 year olds,"I thought the book was great. It offered me a tremendous amount of opportunities to help my toddler learn and explore. I have been reading to my toddler since her birth, also I was singing songs. I still felt there was much more that I could be doing during the day to stimulate her mind and to help her grow. This book stated it all. It showed me simple quick and easy things that I could do each day. Between cooking meals and cleaning the home, I wanted somethings that I could do with my daughter in a quick and easy yet efficient manner for her and this was the book that I needed. I give this book four stars each parent of a toddler should have one in their library."
1,Not for true film lovers,"I was so excited to dive into this book, but was quickly disappointed.I don't know what these top ten lists are based on?! It has a top ten movie list for Geena Davis, but not Bette Davis, it has a list for Kevin Costner movies, but not Johnny Depp's.The top ten scariest movies included the 1999 version of ""The Haunting"", but not the original 1963 version; Rob Reiner's director list included ""North"" but not ""This is Spinal Tap""; and ""Raging Bull"" wasn't on the best Boxing movies of all time.This book is aimed for the crowd that adores car explosions, special effects, and Adam Sandler. They'll be happy to know that ""The Water Boy"" took the #1 spot for best football movie of all time. Sorry, Rudy."
1,"A blockbuster, and therefore short sighted, view of film.","I am extremely disappointed in this book. I thought there would be insight into cinema as an art and not just a regurgitation of facts about films accepted by the masses. Tarantino is not in the index or mentioned besides the listing of him as Oscar winner for Pulp Fiction (writer) - the book was made in 2002. The lists in general seem to be based purely on sales and not artistic talent. For the ""Top Ten for Directors"" this book rated Coppola's Dracula higher than The Godfather and Scorsese's Cape Fear higher than Taxi Driver. Personally I find the the entire thing to be unnecessary trash- A resource of information that can easily be found on wikipedia. I was going to give away this book but honestly in good conscious I cannot."
5,"GREAT MUSIC, GREAT SOUND","Of course everybody's heard ""Mack the Knife"" and ""Splish, Splash,"" but it's the other songs on this collection that stand out. Darin has a great voice and is able to adapt to many different genres of music. The remastering job on these tracks is excellent and the price is low. A great deal."
4,Essential Bobby Darin,"Bobby Darin was a multi-talented performer who was forgotten until Kevin Spacey did a fantastic job reviving his memory in the DVD ""Beyond the Sea"". This compilation gives the listener a broad scope as to Darin's many styles. A must for 50-60's music fans."
1,Terrible sound,"You get what you pay for. This cheap phone has a cheap sound to it. People often have trouble hearing me on the other end, and there is this annoying echo that the other party hears. Pay some more $$ and upgrade!"
4,Good Stuff,"This chick has lots of potential. This is like the beginning. She has a great voice and decent musicians backing her up. With better songwriting, since words are so important in country music, she could easily be big. ""Sometimes It Takes Balls..."" is the best song on the album, and its hilarious. The rest is twang mixed with blues. I'd buy her next one."
4,"ABS, buns, and a little bit o' thigh.","I've been using the FIRM videos off and on for about 3 months. Recently I decided that I was going to start exercising ""seriously"" again and I added this one thinking that I could shape up my outer (and especially inner) thighs. While there are <some> inner thigh exercises, it's mostly abs. I would recommend using this tape in combination with another exercise regime since it's virtually impossible to do a lot of the ab work--the leg extensions! (How do they DO that! ) without your back crying for mercy. I would have preferred more inner thigh work and less abs. It's still VERY good though, and the FIRM tapes are the best tapes I've ever used! (Eat your heart out Oxycise and Body Flex! )"
2,Misleading Title,"I bought this tape expecting a buns, hips, & thighs workout. As soon as I popped the in the tape, she started working abs. It seemed like that's most of what she worked the whole video. Why don't they title it ""Abs & Buns?"" I didn't want an ab workout, I wanted a buns, hips & thighs workout like the title suggested. The instructor is too monotone and non-motivating for my taste, but some people may like her for that reason."
2,Not much of a workout for hips & thighs!,"I bought this tape, mainly because the title says ""Sculpted Hips, Thighs & Buttocks"". There are only two very short segments for these areas. The rest of the workout is all abs. Mainly abs. I thought they put the wrong tape in the box. I gave this video away the next day. I'll stick with Buns of Steel!"
4,Excellent beginner/intermediate workout.,"This is a great tape, but the title is misleading. It works the abs a lot, too. I use it on my ""lazy days"" because the Standing Legs video is much harder. Tracie Long is a good instructor, but I still wish they'd bring back Susan Harris."
4,"price was nice, time will tell if thay last.","ordered them and thay arrived fast, price was great, i hope thay last, a little hard to replace, mounting bolts hard to reach. anyone wanting a bargan would need to conseder these lights."
3,OK for a replacement...,"These lights are just ok, nothing special, molded plastic frame was alitle off so it is crooked in the cut out, whis drives me crazy."
4,Good,Good light. Bought this and the other side. Been installed for about a month and have had zero issues. When I go over a bumpy road I can tell they're bouncing a little bit because the bracket is plastic but on a fairly smooth road they don't bounce at all. Clear decently bright beam. Glad I bought them especially for this price. Truck is a 2000 silverado.
5,Replacement fog light,I bought this as a replacement for my old fog light because the lens came off. This product was is perfect condition and fit my truck perfectly and it came with the bulb. The only complaint I have with this is that it didn't come with any instructions on how to aim the light.
1,Incorrect Part,"The part received does not fit the drivers side if my '99 chevy PU. The lamp housing is shaped correctly for the hole, however, the bracket assembly is positioned incorrectly and does nor flange up with the bolt holes. I have tried repeatedly to get a correct replacement part from the vendor without success."
3,An interesting and rare book from Ghan,"An good story with some interesting views on Germany from the inside. Does not have the emotional impact of some of his other works, but worth the read and a must for a serious collector."
4,What's not to like?,Charming and intelligently written. Slip away into the small English village for a few hours and dare to match wits with Miss Marple.
4,The Body in the Library,"This was the first Agatha Christie book that I have read. I bought the book, because I have heard alot about Agatha Christie. The book has humoe and twist that keeps you guessing."
4,Typical Agatha Christie,"Just a good Agatha Christie novel. Simple story, while the characters find out ""whodunnit"" in the background, and then explain the mystery to you at the end (while still leaving the reader mostly in the dark).I'm just glad I read it on my Kindle. Since the language is a little antiquated, there were many words I didn't know, and it was great to have my built-in dictionary right there when I could highlight a word and look it up."
5,"The Body,in the Library",Love Miss Marple!I want to grow up to be just like her. Her talents are so basic but so spot on.
5,Agatha Christie is the master,"This book had so many red herrings, I couldn't believe it. Agatha Christie proves once again why she's the Queen of Mystery. This one kept me gussing right up until the end. Clever, well-written mystery, multiple suspects, multiple motives...what more can you ask for?"
3,My First Agatha Christie Book,"I got this title free through Amazon. It was a very easy read and a nice low-key, fluffy book. Miss Marple is cute. I wish she had been in the story more. She popped in the scenes here and there and was the person who eventually solved the crime (of course) but other characters dominated.The reason I gave this story a three is there was very little description of the surroundings. It's nice to get a feel for the characters by reading of their setting. Very little of this was done. Christie also repeated - a lot. 'The old many is fragile and could die at any moment.' was talked about repeatedly in the story.I didn't hate it, just had hopes for something better."
4,Other Mysteries,"I wanted to read some more of Agatha Christies mysteries, since I will have free time when I retire. I am a mystery solver buff."
1,slow reading,this book has a slow start and i am bored. there has been nothing exciting happen in the first 75 pages so I quit
3,Good Mystery Series,The mystery was good but I thought it took an awful long time for Miss Marple to get involved in solving the crime.
3,A crime in the library.,I am a big fan of Agatha Christie and usually love her books but this one was a bit confusing.
4,Miss Marple helps a friend,"Miss Marple is called to the home of her friend Dolly Bantry when a dead body is discovered in the library. The body is that of a young girl and Dolly is afraid that her husband will be accused of the crime. Miss Marple does some sleuthing, along with some professional investigators, and of course she comes up with the solution to the crime before they do. All of the usual motives of love and money are involved and the solution is a typical complex web which is common to Agatha Christie's mysteries. This book is not quite as ingenious as others in the series and moves at a somewhat slow pace, so it doesn't rate 5 stars, but it is a good read nevertheless."
3,Average audio book,"This may be more engaging as a 'real read' than as an audio listen, so I will add my 2-cents: fine for commuting, but somewhat dissatisfying audio book - average with Stephanie Cole. As to the story, (1) predictability is really quite tenuous, and (2) character development provides few whom the listener can 'love.' Reason to care about the body in the library? A sweet young thing pretty much covers it. A bit of fun is had when Miss Marple unravels the case in closing, showing all the pert signs of a sweet, perceptive and well-grounded English villager."
1,Tedious,Page after page of shallow character development would be tolerable if the characters weren't so utterly boring.Not a typical Christie yarn. Very little development of the mystery - except for page after page of people who aren't Miss Marple speculating. No puzzles to unravel. Just endless details about these boring characters until the end.
2,Boaring,"This book was the first Agatha Christie book I read, and I thought it was boaring. So I thought that Christie wasent a really good writer. But then I read some of her other books, and they were great! I recomend to all: Don't read this book. I think you will find it boaring. (I want to get in contact with other Agatha Christie fans. I am a 12 yeard old girl from Norway.)"
4,Loved it,"I absolutely love anything Agatha Christie wrote, so I may be a bit biased! As per usual, I didn't figure out the culprit of the murder!"
4,Good value,"This is a nice little Miss Marple story, written as a sort of joke, I think. There are a few cases of meta-humor, including Miss Marple saying she'd never be clever enough to write detective stories and a little boy mentioning he has Agatha Christie's autograph. The mystery is solid and the story is good."
3,More than a dead body,"Although the story line is interesting enough, the writing style is somewhat ho-hum. It certainly doesn't grab you at the first sentence and make you want to continue reading. I haven't finished the book and so don't know how unique the solution to the crime is, but I'm not expecting anything mind blowing."
4,MIss Marple Grows on You,"At first, I did not enjoy the Miss Marple books, but I have grown an appreciation for them. There are more interesting Miss Marple books out there, but this book is a solid read with interesting characters."
2,I used to like Miss Marple,"But I found her irritating in this book. Overall I'd summarize it as a rather interesting, if dry, story. I was interested in the basic storyline, but the characters were utterly flat and did very little to peak my interest. I seemed to recall I used to like Agatha Christie, but that was a long time ago, back when I was...younger. I would say her story are okay for a quick, light read, but if you really want depth and good character development, steer clear.Also, Miss Marple doesn't hold a candle to Poirot!"
3,Miss Jane Marple,"I have never read an Agatha Christie book before now and i can say that I was dissapointed in this book. Some of the plot was confusing and the book jumped around too much. Miss Marple was clever in the way she tought to catch the killer. The way she thought and sorted through ideas kept you wanting to read. I feel that this book deserves atmost three stars, because it sort of kept you wondering and guessing. I never guessed the killer right, and never suspected that person.If slow speed mysteries are your thing, this is the perfect book. Agatha Christie has a unique writting style, and I love Miss Marple!"
3,Not her Best...,"I'll be honest here, this isn't her best. I enjoy Miss Marple mysteries, but this one didn't grasp me as other Agatha Christie books (I highly recomend ""And then there were none"".) If you want a book to keep you reading until late at night, dont read this one. Halfway through the book, I tossed it and picked up, ""Sleeping Murder."" Also by Agatha Christie. I did give it three stars though because it did provide some ""whodunnit"" atmosphere, but not enough to keep me reading. Hope I helped!"
3,Typical Christie tale,"I thought it was a typical Christie story, with a few unexpected twists and turns. Enjoyed it and recommend it to Christies fans."
4,Avid Miss Marple Fan,"I bought this book because although I own and thoroughly enjoy the DVD of the movie I had never actually read the book and was happy to read that the movie had remained mostly true to the book which it getting rarer these days. If you enjoy Miss Marple I believe you will enjoy reading about the platinum blond who no one knew found mysteriously in the library. Miss Marple is an astute observer of human nature and, of course, eventually unravels all the twists and turns (and there are many) of this fascinating mystery."
4,I like Jane Marple,"I don't know why anyone would buy a book by Agatha Christie expecting sex and violence. Her style was to create the atmosphere of an English village before 1935 and to create a puzzle involving the death of someone in the village. Her detectives don't beat anyone up or make love to the suspects. Her detective is given the same clues that the reader sees, and in the last chapter, the detective weaves the relevant clues into the solution. In The Body in the Library, the detective is Jane Marple, an elderly spinster who uses a sharp mind so solve the puzzle. I like the early Jane Marple mysteries; The Body in the Library is fairly typical. You might find this book more enjoyable if you first read The Murder at the Vicarage."
3,Kindle Formatting Problem,"Okay, so I'm a fan of Miss Marple, and this is a fine story, so on that count I give it five stars.But in reading it on the Kindle, while the visual format is fine, there is a rather annoying problem: all speaking parts begin with a reverse apostrophy instead of a quotation. The effect of this is that when your start the text-to-speach (TTS) function, every speaking part opens with the Kindle saying ""backquote,"" as in'I did not commit that murder!' being read as ""backquoteI did not commit that murder."" Minus two stars.Perhaps the publisher will fix that and push the repaired version to our Kindles. Or maybe it's just a new technique for saying on th ebook page that TTS is enabled, but still maintain their audiobook sales."
3,A good read,Not riveting however I didn't solve it before the end. It was refreshing to read a book without borderline porn or gore.
4,The Body in the Library,"Good read. I do like Agatha Christie and enjoyed this very much. I didn't5 figure out the ending before the end,"
4,Miss Marple Solves the Case,"I have been an Agatha Christie fan for years. Ms. Christie's writing style & novels are fantastic as she is truly a master of the mystery genre.""The Body in the Library"" is a wonderful example of Ms. Christie's writing technique. The characters, the plot, and dialogue are all wonderfully developed in ""The Body in the Library"". And as with most Agatha Christie novels, I am always left guessing who the true killer is until it is revealed at the very end of the novel."
5,Awesome,"This is the first book I purchased for my new Kindle Paperwhite. I've always loved Agatha Christie, and this book didn't disappoint! The quality was great. Definitely a great beginning to my relationship with my new Kindle."
3,Poulan 22-inch mower,Mower arrived in a timely manner and what had to be assembled was easy. One wheel was bent and easily straightened. Started easily and still does. Wish it had more power. I have seen similar mowers for sale at local stores for less money when you consider shipping costs. Otherwise happy with the machine.
4,Better than I'd hoped for,I was concerned before this lawn mower arrived that I had made a mistake & purchased something I was going to have turn around & return. How could a $115 lawn mower be any good? Yesterday morning I took it out of the box & mowed my yard--a yard with ankle-deep patches of clover. My yard now looks excellent!! I am extremely pleased that this mower could handle the job just as well as an expensive mower and would definately recommend it to anyone looking to buy a new lawn mower.
2,It came broken!,"To my disappointment, the mower was broken the moment I got it out of the box! I tried pulling the cord to start the mower, and it wouldn't go back in. I had already put gas and motor oil in it, so returning it was going to be a huge problem. I called the technical support because it's under warranty, and I was directed to many different numbers before I got to a local authorized dealer. It's still being fixed right now, so I don't know whether this mower is great or terrible. I am quite unhappy with this purchase because by the time you set it up and put gas in it, it's not an easy item to return should it not work!"
1,just daybed sides and back no mattress frame,WISH I HAD READ THE OTHER REVIEWS.....DOES NOT COME WITH FRAME FOR MATTRESS.....PICTURE SHOWS COMPLETE BED AND NEVER SAW ANYWHERE THAT STATED DIFFERENT...ONE SIDE PANEL CRACKED AT SEAM...WAS ABLE TO GET BACK TOGATHER...BUT WILL NEED GLUE...NOW I HAVE TO FIND MATTRESS FRAME....PAINT ON FRONT AND SIDES NICE BUT COULD HAVE A LITTLE MORE ON BACK...TO MUCH OF A HASSEL TO TRY AND REPACKAGE TO SHIP BACK...NOW OFF TO FIND BED FRAME....SO BEWARE OF WHAT YOU SEE....
1,deceptive photograph,"This bed does not come with the link spring that is essential for supporting a mattress. It comes with only the back panel and two side panels. What a hassle to have to search for a link spring after putting the bed together. Bed itself is nice, but it certainly is not a bargain for what you get."
3,"Ok version, hardcore scenes actually detract from the movie.","This is the second version of the movie I have, it's a typical women in prison movie, but the only difference is hardcore scenes, which actually detract from the movie, as they were performed by adult film actors. The women look decent. Ok, but the unrated will give you as much, without the distraction other footage."
2,Um...............,"Typical prison flick, women going to prison run by a pervert Warden (Herbert Lom) and his assistant (Mercedes McCambridge). Nothing really much to think of, I called it a spaghetti prison flick. The first thing you hear when the movie starts, is a horrible song, where a woman sings that she was ""born in the sunlight, born in the sun"". They play this song over and over during the film, and it drives you crazy. I don't know if they were trying to promote this song for distribution? Movie not much to rave about, except when Mercedes McCambridge has the hots for Herbert Lom, when he visits the prison, she treats him like a God, dressing up in her sexy garments (when she steps into the room you will see, she looks ghastly) hoping he will lay her. Of course he doesn't and she is frustrated. I just bought it for my prison film collection. Otherwise you can just save your money"
3,EURO - 70' S PRISON WOMEN FLICK,"if you like the women in prison flicks, you will like this one. there is a good deal of flesh and some good fight scenes, even some obligatory rape scenes. despite the subtitles and the standard spanish style background music, this flick is a good one to have."
1,RIP OFF!!!!!!!!,"This is a out right rip off!!!!! I deserve a $30 refund from Blue Undergrtound for out right lying to us! Please refer back to Jordan M. Oakes review it is true in everyword! You will not see any good hard porn from Maria Rohm or any of the well known actors in this flick, they added terrible scenes through out the movie where needed. Only thing he forgot to mention was that it is not even in widescreen and there is absolutely no speacial features, you can't even take the subtitles off. My only fault is I wish I had read his review before I paid for this RIP OFF!!!!! Shame to Blue Underground!"
1,Dreadful!!!!!!,"This DVD is dated, and lacks the eroticism and/or nudity you would expect in a women prison movie. I bought the ""Unrated"" version, but I wonder what that rating was based on. I have bought several ""R"" rated movies in the women prison genre that were rather hot, but compared to this 1969 rubbish they were volcanic. I was sincerely disapointed, and wished I had read some of the reviews prior to purchasing this dreadful movie."
1,Jess Franco an overrated filmmaker.,"99 women is a terrible film. I bought it because Luciana Paluzzi was in the cast and she is one of my favorite actresses. I know that Luciana has never made any good film with the sole exception of Thunderball and maybe other two or three you may consider average. O.K. Luciana is beautiful and that's all she needs, but beware, this film was directed by Jess Franco. This guy made terrible boring films no matter who is in the cast and 99 women is not the exception. You will never get anything from a Jess Franco's film. There are no thrills, no good stories, no sexy scenes (he always cheats with what he promises in this aspect), the title song is hideous and Luciana is no more than 3 minutes in this movie and the rest of it... stinks¡ Nothing is plausible or at least logic. So forget about it. Don't buy it. And the same goes for all Jess Franco's movies."
1,Big mistake,"I bought this book, but sent it back immediately. Unless you're a screenplay-writing-student, this book is of little value to you. It literally goes like this:Man screams: AARGH! Woman cries: What are you doing? Couple leaves room.All in all: think carefully if this is what you need. Don't buy it just for the scary cover!"
5,For those who wish to 3d animate.,"I recieved this book as a gift from one of my relatives. This shows the work and effort that goes into computer animation. This book is really intresting, and shows one of the Navy Spirit Ad in the process."
4,Ok...looses air fast though,"This ball was a bit spendy for the quality, it works good but looses air fast, have had to pump it up before use every time, gets old on a daily basis....otherwise would be great"
4,Great option for beginners,Purchased this ball for my 10 year old daughter who is just getting started with volleyball. Great value and quality for the money - several other balls are either way too expensive (especially when you're not sure if a child will stay interested in the sport) or are cheaply made (poor quality that won't last). This ball seems to be the best of both and was perfect for my daugther to practice with.
3,A Little hard,Ball is Ok quality. But ws alittle disappointed on how hard the ball was.. Will continue to use as practice balls but nothing more... I will say they are very durable!!
1,It is not a volleyball...,"I don't know how people can give this ball more than 1 star. I simply can't believe that human beings become so strong from 20 years ago that they can play this brick like ball. I know that there is good and bad volleyballs but they are at least have appropriate weight. This is the worst ever ball. One that doesn't bounce of your hands at all. It is as if you are playing with a soccer ball. Believe me, it may be replica but they wouldn't play there with such a disaster. Brick regular brick."
4,mellow and fine,"Wonderful rock (as stated above) that won't give you a migraine. You can play their music over and over and not get tired of it.The only complaint I have is the talking number (Chicks) on this CD, in fact, that's my only complaint with their music. When the guy talks (not sure who it is, Dave or someone) it just disrupts the entire mood.When I buy a CD for the music, I expect it to be ALL music."
1,Don't waste your money on this one,"This film came recommended to me so I took a chance on it. What a mistake! Believe me when I tell you there is no suspension of disbelief with this movie. The movie is about some genius who comes up with a 'process' that will be worth millions and then gets scammed by a group of people. I won't give away the whole movie, but the whole idea that this person would be so gullible and stupid to fall for a scam like this made the movie more of a bad comedy than a thriller. I just could not buy the story at all."
1,I don't get it,"This film has stilted dialogue, a plot that is uninteresting, unbelievable, contrived, and predictable, and unremarkable performances. I really don't get why Mamet is such a big deal."
4,"Great, but one big goof","The movie is intricate and cleverly written, but there's a major screwup in one scene, that I would have missed were it not for DVD. It's in scene 13, and it involves the red book. Repeat that scene after you've watched the film and you'll understand. And keep your eye on the book. And by the way, one scene was directly ripped off in Michael Mann's ""The Insider"". And the way I remember it, the scene is stolen in the Pacino film almost verbatim! Hint-it involves company lawyers."
5,Wonderful movie that the average person probably wont like,"This movie starts out slow, but builds as it goes on. As usual, Mamet's dialogue will probably drive some people crazy. And his girlfriend puts in a very very weak performance. But people who won't be rushing out to see the latest Hollywood block buster will enjoy the many plot twists in this movie, some of which are obvious, others you won't see coming. The mere fact that the centerpiece of the story [""the formula""] is never revealed will probably also annoy many viewers. Ignore those people who gave this 1 or 2 stars, they are the folks who would give something like the latest Bruce Willis film 5 out of 5. If your a Steve Martin fan, you may be disapointed to see him in a serious dramatic role.Highly Recommended, also be sure to see Mamet's House of Games if you enjoyed Spanish Prisoner"
3,.,"Worst film based on a work of David Mamet's that I have seen. The only reason this gets 3 stars is because I like Mamet so much, and consequently did enjoy the film, but this was essentially the sole reason. It is a poor movie, which is occasionally clever and consistently interesting, but hardly surprising or original, and generally clumsily executed. I found it fascinating to watch Steve Martin grapple with a role in a Mamet film; he doesn't do an especially great job, but it's sort of fun to watch. I kind of got into the main guy, too, though I'm not sure why. Anyhow, bottom line: for die-hard Mamet fans only -- and don't expect to be blown away in any case. House of Games was much more effective and revolves around similar themes."
4,Well developed characters with a story that captavates.,"The Spanish Prisoner is a smart, well written, and well acted film. There are enough plot twists to keep one guessing. The five main characters in the story are well developed, with plenty of real traits that we can all admire (or loath), and associate with to some degree. In many ways I felt this film to be every bit as good as recent classics ""Lonestar"", ""Fargo"", and ""Sling Blade""."
4,Smart and enticing,The movie kept you on the edge of your seat. it was an intellectual thriller that kept you guessing.
5,Excellent,"I love this film. It has suspense, interesting characters, and so many plot twists. Truthfully, I have trouble watching this film because I know Campbell Scott's character is going to be taken advantage of. This film is subtle and requires you to pay attention. It's not a film that you watch half asleep. Otherwise you won't be able to follow the plot. There are clues along the way. I don't know what those reviewers who said it was terrible are talking about. Don't listen to them, it's wonderful."
4,"A ""Mc Mamet"" Movie","The film has many nice twists although the story is not too logic. Every actor did a great job. When you know ""House of games"" you have a dèja vu. You know at too many scenes what you expect next. So you have a nice film, but the characters would not act in real lifethe way they do here. In comparision House of Games is a Perfect movie in every aspect, the story and the characters are convincing."
5,Pretty darn clever,"Complex acting--each character has his and her own ""tell""--and tight story. If you liked the mind games of Usual Suspect, you'll like this. That said: I don't know whether I've seen way too many movies, read too much on confidence games, or (least likely) too smart for my own good, but I was at least one step ahead of the story pretty much until the very end."
1,ASIANS DON'T COUNT!,"I was offended! In Mamet's world, it appears to be ""normal"" to think of Asians as incapable of witnessing criminal behavior. We're supposed to be ""surprised"" when the Asian intervenes."
1,ridiculous,"I like Mamet's movies, ALOT, but this one is just utterly silly. Several ridiculous plot twists occur that left me rolling my eyes. At about the 1hour until about the end I really wanted to turn this movie off, but decided I had came to far.Also, it seems as if all the characters were really speaking as if they were the same person speaking, no real individuality established, very amateur writing/dialogue."
1,MAMMET'S WORST EFFORT ! HORRIBLE MOTION PICTURE!,"THis great director is only living by his fame in this lousy film. Due to his legion of fans, he still gets great reviews to this horrible movie, where he seemed to forget the basic rule that the first 15 minutes must, at least, show the audience whio is who and what's all about. The character are laughable and with awkward actings, like if directed by someone who doesn't care for the movie. Steve Martin is horrible (like in all recent movies he has made), Campbell Scott doesn't convince anybody, the plot is unbearable. And some people still give this farse a 5-star rating..."
2,Cruising for a Fall,"The last minute plot-twist has the mildly jejune quality that is a hallmark of the B+ movie. But alas, there is more, and for me the movie does not make the B+ mark. That twist also renders the premises of the movie both highly improbable and sufficiently illogical to seriously undermine the verisimilitude on which the thereto carefully constructed suspense rests. The movie could have been nearly as emotionally compelling as -- if understandably less epic narratively than -- ""The Godfather"". And in fact it sort of is for 90% of the viewing. Then close to the very end it becomes a sort of flawed parlor game of the mind. Suspended disbelief comes crashing down. I don't think I have ever left a movie theater feeling so let down."
2,you have to be ready,"I wish people would leave Rebecca Pidgeon alone. The Spanish Prisoner was not a vehicle for her talent. Her acting is stylized and somewhat narrow, but she's the best there is at this kind of droll presence...the deadpan delivery, the silent intensity, the understated cleverness. You have to discover what she means... so if you are a viewer who looks at films more than once, who likes to return to characters of a decent plot to study sets, props, costumes (and what they reveal), then see her in Mamet's The Winslow Boy. Lucky lucky man to have her in that film."
2,Huge disappointment,"This film dealing with industrial espionage (the process involved is a McGuffin, since the movie never tells what is exactly about) starts well. However, as plot twist after plot twist accumulates, our interest wanes, and by the time the movie ends we just don't care anymore about what's going on. There is a final twist that is totally unbelievable since Steve Martin would have to anticipate the way that Campbell Scott would react to every situation. Finally, Campbell Scott and Rebecca Pidgeon might be the least charismatic screen couple ever. Their total lack of chemistry is the final nail on the coffin of this movie."
5,"Very good, clean movie","As with most films of this type, it is better if you watch it without knowing anything about it.This is a good intellectual movie that is pretty clean and has a very tight plot. Most of the ""plot holes"" mentioned in the 1-star reviews are easily resolved by watching the movie carefully. In fact, if you pay close attention, you can generally tell that many of the supposed ""holes"" are actually key plot elements that are the result of exquisite attention to detail.There's almost no action, which counts towards the movie in my book. Too many movies these days replace careful writing with gratuitous violence.The script is unusual, but tolerable. The acting was very good--I found the characters to be believable."
5,Wonderfully twisted,"One of our favorite movies. I hadn't seen anything by David Mamet, but he got our attention with this one. The acting is fantastic, especially Steve Martin and singer-actress Rebecca Pidgeon (who is Mamet's wife). We've watched this over and over again, even though we know how it will end. Despite a couple of minor flaws (I still don't get how there is strictly a ""Spanish prisoner"" gambit; the hero's best friend is so glib that I wasn't too upset by what happened to him - no spoiler!) and a few implausibilities in the plot, this is a gem. Keep an eye out for the brief, weird walk-on role of Ed ""Al Bundy"" O'Neill as an FBI agent. ""Good people, bad people, they generally look like what they are"" says the Steve Martin character. Or do they?"
5,Best Movie Ever,"I saw this movie several years ago and it has something unique about it. It is the best study of human behavior I have ever seen. This is my third copy. If you've ever worked for a highly political environment where there was a lot of money at stake, this is the movie that you must see. I've worked for dot coms for years and this became my bible of human behavior and deception. Steve Martin plays a villain and is brilliant. I have played one scene over and over. For veteran dot com'ers and they all get a copy. Watch Steve Martin's explanation of why employers treat their best and brightest so incredibly badly. The truth in the monologue can be applied to relationships and work to give true clarity behind why people do what they do."
3,"Great plot twists, but takes a wrong turn","Many of the other reviews have captured my feelings about ""The Spanish Prisoner."" Certainly it was very well made. The acting was remarkable as was the writing, especially the dialogue in certain scenes. It is the ending, however, that made me think I was suddenly watching another film. So suddenly it became hackneyed and anti-climactic that I ended up being angry after the film was over, not satisfied. The ending felt like an all too hurried cop-out, not the least bit clever or surprising.I hoped that there would be an alternate ending on the DVD. Alas...this is all there is..."
2,A Real Disappointment,"The only surprise in this film was the incredibly far-fetched conclusion. After a masterpiece like ""Homicide"", I expected more from Mamet."
3,moronic but pretty entertaining,"The movie itself is pretty moronic starting right from the phrase ""in layman terms"" in the very beginning and up to ""can you help me?"" at the very end. But it is pretty entertaining with a lot of actors giving great performances along the way."
2,"Not as tense as ""Glengarry Glen Ross""","If you enjoyed the drama of David Mamet's ""Glengarry Glen Ross,"" this one may be a disappointment. It's a mildly interesting ""everyone's conspiring against me"" movie, but the hero (Campbell ""my names are reversed"" Scott as Joe Ross) is too clever by half for someone who's supposed to be a ""boy scout,"" and Rebecca Pidgeon annoyingly overenunciates all her words in her role as Susan Ricci. The part I enjoyed most was chuckling at Ed ""Al Bundy"" O'Neill's role as ""FBI Team Leader."""
5,A very worth while motion picture experience.,"This was one of the best thriller/mystery movies I have seen in an extremely long time. The writing was incredible and the story kept me interested all the way through. Also, some great, and eerily fascinating, performances from the entire cast, especially Steve Martin, who proves that he's not just some guy with an arrow through his head. A must see for people bored of the barrage of unoriginal garbage at their local video store."
1,"Bad script, bad acting and lousy story yield a total waste","Make yourself happy and rent or buy something else. This film is easily the worst I have ever seen. From Campbell Scott's irritating stupidity to the aggravatingly sappy writing to the inane story, this film is void of any positives whatsoever.Amazingly enough, House of Games was an excellent movie. This is a flop of the highest order."
1,"Bad, Bad, Mamet",This movie is downright silly. I found myself laughing at every imaginable inappropriate moment. Some of the acting is good but David's wife who plays the lead is awful. It is no wonder why she does not have much of a career. The plot is absoloutely ridiculous. I saw the ending coming a mile away and it wasn't even that interesting. A MUST NOT SEE!!!!!!!!!
1,Will kill you slowly,"A rather bizarre piece of film with a sufficiently interesting beginning that falls deep into abyss after the first fifteen minutes. Unsteady acting by everyone, except perhaps for Steve Martin and that does say a lot as to the drama character of this movie. Unpaced scenes, dialogue that must translate better to the stage than to the celluloid and baffling casting. Eventually, you try to make the most of the moment and attempt at finding a point to the whole trama, however and once you are almost to the point of sacrificing intelect for a momentary lapse of stupidity, the ending hits you like a brick mortar in Gaza. Don't bet on the reviews you read here, (as I did), avoid purchasing this movie and look for it on your video store if you think that I am full of it. You won't regret it... I did."
1,An Imbecile's Opinion,"Has anyone else noticed the contempt some positive reviewers have for those who disagree? I found ""shallow existnce"", ""cartoon soaked brain"", ""brain dead"", ""stick to watching 'Varsity Blues'"", ""try not to see it with people who have a short attention span"", and the not too subtle ""thinker's film"" and ""average veiwer probably won't like"". Oh well...The protagonist, Joe Ross, comes across as an idiot, who can be counted on, when faced with any decision, to do exactly what it takes to follow the Rube Goldberg plan of the antagonists. For example: Had he not sought out to confront Jimmy Dell, after being ignored in the showroom... Had he simply looked at what he was signing... This scheme actually REQUIRED him to confront Jimmy Dell, REQUIRED him to sign a document without even a glance at it, etc.""Odd Job"" has a point, too.I suppose this makes me an imbecile."
1,Don't waste your time or money !!!!!!!!,This movie has got to be the stupidest movie I have ever seen in my life. It had no point to it. The lead acter(not Steve Martin) was so stupid in this movie he didn't even think. It will make you want to sell your VCR after watching this!!!
1,GARBAGE !,"Say what you wanna say: that this is art, the this movie is intelligent, that it is movie for people with brains, etc, etc. Keep on saying Mammet is a master. say what you want! But this movie is garbage, the worst garbage I've ever seen! The actor are disgustingly uninspired, the pace is almost nonexistant, everything is riduculous. The history is a third-class ""mystery"" case. Blergh!"
4,Surprisingly intriguing and very entertaining!,"I really didn't want to see this movie at first but i was really surprised at its smart plot and shocking twists.Campbell Scott really is a great actor but i didn't realize until i saw his good performance.Steve Martin is good playing a non-comedic role.And it is a very unusual and original movie.And after seeing this i am very interested in seeing David Mamet's other work.I recommend this movie,to all!"
3,"Entertaining to a point, but no depth","This is a supposedly 'intricate' movie, but really comes across as contrived. It's worth renting, but don't expect too much."
1,Bad flick,"Wow, what an awful movie. The only actor who can act in it is steve martin. Why he took this part I will never know.Poor acting. Poor plot and poor me for buying it and wasting 2 hours of time. If you are thinking of getting this, DON'T. If you do, you will find out what I am talking about."
3,Just when you think you have it all figured out...,"About a third of the way into ""The Spanish Prisoner,"" I was beating my head on the sofa and my husband considered turning the movie off. But I am tenacious and wanted to hear it out.I'm glad I did because there was a smart twist towards the end and you have to look beyond what is obviously going on to figure it out before it happens."
4,Wonderful plot-twisting film!,"Fantastic mystery! All the right plot twists to make this highly entertaining. One word of advice to people who haven't seen it yet: DO NOT TURN IT OFF! The first 45 minutes of the movie seem so bizarre and boring that you will think it's a terrible movie and will want to turn it off. Stop yourself!! Trust me, it will all come together in the second half.If you like this movie, I highly recommend ""The Game"" with Michael Douglas and ""A Fish Called Wanda"" with Jamie Lee Curtis."
4,A great suspense movie. Cambell Scott is stunning!!!,I've never seen Steve Martin in any movie that wasn't annoying. But this movie is an exception. Steve Martin is stunning and sane in this movie. On the other hand Scott Camble plays the role of an ingenous brain stormer that gets suckered into a scam to steal is idea. This is turly a movie other writers and directors should look to for inspiration.
5,Eccentric Bliss,"This has been my favorite film for quite a while and I've seen it many times. Some of the criticisms one will read about this film are exactly the reasons why I love it so much. The odd manner of language used is a charm to me. Pidgeon is wonderful in her role and performs it perfectly. Martin is scary in this unusual role for him and Scott plays an excellent naive boy scout type. This film is definitely not for everyone.....in fact, most may find it annoying or hard to watch. I find it delightful and challenging. I give this intelligent PG movie accolades for not succumbing to the sleaze and vulgarity that a lot of films portray. A work of art. Five stars."
3,DVD The Spanish Prisoner,"A good movie to watch a couple of times a year. Very low-keyed performances and obviously not a big budget picture, but we do get to see Steve Martin in a different role. I guess that I consider this one of my ""guilty pleasures"" movies."
2,Not Sateen!,"Even though it says that these are Sateen, they are not. I sent them back because they weren't and could find no indication that they were. For the money though, the sheets seemed to be nice and Amazon did a pretty good job of refunding my money promptly."
1,CRAPPY!!!!,THe people who SAY these are SOFT dont know what SATEEN feels like. We went from 400TC to these and ended up putting the 44tc back on because it was like sleeping on a PAPER NAPKIN!!! THey are soft... but not as soft as they SHOULD BE! If youre going from targets 250tc sheets to these youll be happy! But in my opinion THEY ARE NOT SATEEN!
1,800 grit sandpaper,"Must write a review so I may save someone else from a sleepless night. Sheets were washed and still felt like sandpaper. I literally had to sleep in the guest room. I guess the old saying ""you get what you pay for"" applied. If you are used to nice sheets, you will hate these.The egyptian label is very misleading. It only take 1% egyptian cotton thread to qualify sheets as such. Watch to be sure that you are buying 100% egyptian.Given this from a sheet supplier, but good food for thought.[...]"
3,Good Old Fashioned Approach to Kindergarten,"This book is not slick. No color graphics; no PC buzz words. Just simple activities that will remind you of when YOU were in Kindergarten. Best features: Monthly Lesson Plans, seasonally themed, as well as a materials list & reading list for each month. Projects are SIMPLE and use commonly found materials. With 477-pages of content, you can pick and choose as you see fit. A really broad range of subjects are covered -- US History, P.E, Cooking, Music, Nursery Rhymes, Science, but at a Kindergarten level. Although many suggested books are out of print, making substitutions really isn't that hard at this level. The typeface that looks like a typewriter did it and the hand-drawn graphics are jarring in an on-line world. If you can't get past the typeface to the words, you won't like it. If you like the common-bond of traditions, you will. Would be great for a homeschool co-op."
2,"Magnetic Tape not so ""Strong""",The strength of the magnetism on the magnetic tape is not what I consider strong.The intended use of the tape was to hold many small sockets on a board inside my tool box.The sockets do stay in place if the board is not moved too quickly. I had expectations that there would be some resistance to lifting a socket but there is barely any. Long Allen sockets and long Torx bits laying on their side hold better as they have more surface area against the tape.Not a good product for my project.
1,Horrible,"Probably the worst thing I've watched all year. No scratch that ""EVER'! I love gangster movies, watch em all the time. But this is just a sad unbearably attempt to be a gangster movie. I couldn't even make it through the first 30 minutes before I dosed off. Actors are the worst, story-line is weak, and the scene where the father goes to jail made me sick. So fake and unbelievably. Disappointing since I like most the Rappers in it."
1,Most of the content is missing,"I know this is a free book and it seems silly to complain, but to let the people know who might download it: only the first 40 or 50 lines of each section are included, so that the majority of the work, which is all in verse, roughly iambic pentameter, is actually not included in this Kindle edition."
1,Total dud!,I'd give it less than 1 star if I could. Please don't waste your money on this as I did. I charged my battery for 6 hours and it never reached a full charger (very frustrating). I finally gave up and put it in my Nikon charger and it charged in less than 1/2 hour. I bought this because I needed the international voltage capability. My Nikon charger is not international for some strange reason (it only accepts 120 volts). I can't believe I wasted $22 on this!!
3,Kinda Cool,"This thing is pretty cool, although I had some trouble getting it. The supplier supposedly didn't package the sensor ring in with the receiver. However, eventually, the seller made sure I got everything I needed and had the supplier ship me the sensor ring directly.Everything functions properly, but you definitely need to know how to use this thing to reach its full potential. Super fun to play around with. Just need to find the right pedals to work with. Overall a very cool product, BUT only as cool as your knowledge of using it with certain pedals."
5,worked!,What else can I say about something like this? It did what it was supposed to do and it still is. But then again I've never had any bad memory. Hmmm??????????!!!! Yes I would recommend this product.
4,prompt refund,"product didn't work with my system, and I returned it. It was easy to return, and my purchase prices was refunded promptly. Good job."
5,Idiot-proof,"I've never even seen the innards of my PC, let alone attempted an upgrade. But I followed the instructions, and it worked beautifully! I am so pleased with this purchase."
5,"Great product,great price.",Running Vista home premium on 1gb of memory was an exercise of patience I got tired of. An upgrade to 2gb made a big difference. Opening or closing any application is like flipping a switch. There's virtually no wait. I've noticed spyware/virus scans go quicker too. The install took all of 5 minutes and my pc recognized the upgrade immediately with no problems. All this for less than $40 shipped to my door.
1,"Kingston ""live support""? Does not exist","Kingston ValueRam 2GB 667MHz DDR2 Non-ECC CL5 DIMM (Kit of 2)Purchased above item following Kingston screen prompts, wound up with memmory that did not fit into the memory slots in my EMachine [not a model currently listed]. Probably an error in selection on my part.I completed the Kingston ""live support"" protocol twice within the last week to try and arrange an exchange, but have received no return call, and don't see an alternative contact method handy.This is not a pleasant experience."
2,Not standard,"I tried in every way to fit this into my PC (its a Dell), then I gave it to my brother who has a HP but with no success. I strongly do no recommend it."
5,great show for kids,"Max and Ruby is my daughter's favorite show on Sprout. Well, Calliou is too, but I think she likes this even better. These are great programs for children to watch. Wholesome shows for children. She gets so excited when Max and Ruby or Calliou comes on t.v."
1,Much better available,"I understand that not all families are the same so the odd family dynamic isn't as much of an issue for me as the awful behaviour modelled in this show. My daughter is 2.5 and probably the perfect age for this show, and the absolute worst age to watch it! Ruby is a stereotypically 'girly' big sister who is her younger brother's primary caretaker. Max is a bunny toddler who is unable to utter more than one word - persistently - per episode (frequently 'no'). It sends the message that all that's required to get what you want is to repeat the same thing over and over again until your long-suffering caretaker just gives in. It could be a lovely series. It's cute and there are some good sentiments but Max has never been developed and his character could easily help make your life with your own toddler a lot tougher than it needs to be. Particularly if you have a little copy cat at home. This is fine in very small doses but there are a lot better out there (Kipper / Franklin)."
5,Great movie for fans of Max and Ruby,"My children are big fans of the Max and Ruby television show, and we purchased this to play in the DVD player in our van while driving on a long road trip. It kept them thoroughly entertained."
3,Jungle Book 2 Soundtrack a HIT,"My children are ages 5 & 3. They LOVE the soundtrack that is upbeat and fun. Other Disney soundtrack's are too slow for my boys who love rock and roll.The movie was as fun for me as it was for them. I found this to be a great follow up project for children.If you want thought provoking and intellectual entertainment this is NOT the movie for you. If you long for a feel good soundtrack and movie, that doesn't make you squirm as a parent then see and buy Jungle Book 2."
1,Very Poor Quality,"We ordered 3 of these shelves, and they each arrived in their own separate packaging. Each of them had chipped paint and were of the very poorest quality of construction. We returned them, and ended up making our own shelves."
4,color by number pony,"Color By Number Doodle Pony - Purple Breezethis pony has held up well to many colorings and after washing, it always looked like brand new again."
3,"Great voice, weird recording","I think in this early Aliberti recording, she was experimenting with what she can do with her amazingly soft and delicate beautiful voice. The recording is weird in that it seems like she misses and jumbles some notes and sings some of them off key. I think she was just so focused on her artistic interpretation of the music and creating her unique voice that maybe she wasn't fully paying attention? Although it is a recording, so maybe she liked it enough to not have re recorded what seems like was a mistake. However, with that said, you can already hear her unique manipulation of notes and soft delicate pastel like voice that she will continue to use with utmost perfection, respect, full of emotion and integrity to every note. I think every post Callas singer in their early career probably most likely tries to imitate Callas in one form or another, so accusing her of trying to imitate Callas is unfair and dumb."
2,What is wrong with her voice?,"Aliberti is the most perverse opera singer ever - she seems to deliberately sing off-pitch a la late Callas. She should realize that it took Callas years to achieve that point of deterioration! Anyway, this is a bizarre recording - and also a fascinating one, though the protracted Pirats mad scene gets boring fast as Aliberti seems rather mindless in terms of her interpretation. She is a good mimic though!"
5,book review critique,"This book is a must have text for physicians of all disciplines who treat traumatic injuries of the cervcal spine.Traumatic inuries (i.e. fracture, dislocation,etc.) and soft tissue injuries are addressed as well as diagnoses and mechanisms of injury.Medical legal issues are addressed and relevant information is presented eloquently for the physician."
5,Classic textbook!,The book is mandatory for chiropractors. The text discusses the diagnosis and treatment of major cervical spine syndromes through a chiropractic integrated approach.
1,One DVD of set of three was terrible quality,"I ordered as a gift. Thankfully I did preview the DVDs to check the quality. The two early DVDs were ok considering the dates they aired. The third DVD which was the latest date was terrible.I did sent an email to the vendor and suggested that the either send me a new copy of the bad DVD or we just replace the entire set. The sad thing is that they have not responded, which is usually not an indicator of good faith and did nothing to ensure customer satisfaction.I am therefore left with no option other than to return the product."
5,Pomo Indian Basketery,"Excellent book, added to my knowledge of POMO baskets and Indian baskets in general, well wort reading."
3,Karajan when he's merely proficient,"Karajan seemingly could conduct anything, and he has a Schubert Unfinished on DG, in somewhat scrappier sonics than this EMI remake, which sounds committed. Not this one, though. When he was uninvolved, Karajan still kept the proceedings efficient and crisp, and the Berlin Phil. executes all the notes with disciplined expertness.But Schubert is a special composer, one whose charm is mixed with a fragile poignany, and these performances miss both those qualities. If you want to hear the Schubert 8th and 9th run thorugh the Karajan machinery, this is the CD for you. I should add that his whole Schubert cycle is similarly impersonal."
4,A useful addition to every biologists library,"A collection of in-depth essays on the interaction of light with living organisms. Ensminger includes enough careful explanation to make the work approachable and rewarding to the non-specialist. Beware of the book length as 34% is made up of appendices, a glossary and notes to pages."
1,Not for the Layman,This book is for professionals only! It is not written for general interest readers. It is written in a highly technical language and has almost 100 pages of appendices and footnotes. That might be ok if this was even remotely readable - which it is not.
2,Uneven,"I really wanted to love this cd, but it's just so uneven. Yes, they're some stand out songs, but art too far and few between. Regardless, I love his Lennonist voice."
4,MM36100 tv,"the past two review are true, BUT:For $25 you can get the directTV box that matches the tv. (ebay)For $20 you can get the RCA transcoder for composite to RGB, (ebay)bought the tv used for $200 w/stand, couldn't be happier with HDTV for so little."
1,The worst HDTV ever made,"For starters RCA lies about it having progressive scan, I just bought this tv and rca refuses to take it back. You need a special connecter to hook up a composite to svga(which doesnt exist), with this tv you can only get progressive scan threw svga. Therefore this tv is usless! RCA doesnt make the connecter or anybody else in the world."
4,Is relativity really verified?,"A close reading will show that there are some assumptions that are unproven, and verification of General Relativity rests on this cloud castle. I'm not sure that was the author's intent. But sometimes the result of honest effort exceeds intent."
3,Johann Cristoph Friedrich's oratorio of 1773,"Singers: Barbara Schlick (sop.), Hilke Helling (mezzo), Hein Meens (tenor), Harry Van Der Kamp (bass), directed by Hermann Max with the Kleine Konzert.Oratorio ""Die Kindheit Jesu"" + filler ""Wachet auf, ruft uns die Stimme"". Timing 65'00."
1,does not work!,I would not recommend this product. They are too big to fit on the handle bars of any of my family's bikes. My husband thinks he can find a way to make them work but they should work as is! I don't know who has a bike with handle bars this size but it will not hold a drink unless you want it held upside down.
2,a little misleading,"It says battery retail package, and it is just a battery. The word package should be removed as well as the picture containing the extra spray, as it's not included."
4,Does as it should,This product works as it is intended. Dogs really seem to dislike the Citronella. We had a dog that was a constant barker at everything (outside doggie). We tried this collar and it worked great. The only negative I thought was the battery life and if you have a constant barker like we did you go thru the citronella pretty fast! Which can become expensive.
3,Picture shows 4 batteries - Price is for 2 batteries,Make sure you read the print. I have two dogs that I use the collar on and the batteries didn't last long. I had a hard time finding the battery so I ordered them here. I received them in only 3 days which was awesome but I thought there were four batteries in the pack as shown and there are only two. I would have ordered more if I had taken the time to read the print instead of just looking at the picture.
3,spray sense works?,"As far as the service from this seller, it is always great. However, I find these batteries really don't hold their charge very well."
2,batteries,"yes, these are overpriced. i just go to target or walmart camera section and get one for $2.99. it's ridiculous what they are trying to charge and these are the cheap one's that don't last long."
5,They work,"Well, the batteries work. Good price, good product. These can be pretty expensive at the store, much better price here. Not much more you can say about batteries."
4,Very complete player,"I have never owned an Ipod Nano, which would be a comparable product. However, I can say that the Sansa e250 seems to be a better option for the price. It has FM stereo radio, a voice recorder (you can also record FM programs), and has a slot for a micro SDcard to expand the capacity. It is extremely easy to use and has a battery that can last around 15 hours (specs say up to 20 hours). The sound quality is excellent. It's only drawback is that loading songs from a CD to the MP3 player is not as friendly as I would like. In order to be able to keep your songs grouped into folders, you have manipulate the songs in the folder through the Windows Media player to insure that all the songs have the same album title. This is somewhat cumbersome when you are mixing songs into a folder from different CD's. The on-line support given by Sandisk when you have a problem, is very good. Overall, I am very pleased with this product."
3,Good info but geared towards children not adults,"This is a nice book which tells you the basic history of Cameroon. It is geared towards children--the writing is basic and simple. While it presents a good overview, adults may find it less than satisfactory."
4,"A MYSTERIOUS, FEMININE FRAGRANCE","It's upbeat, sensuous, and full of life. Live, the latest fragrance from Jennifer Lopez is as zesty as the actress herself - it attracts with notes of Sicilian lemon, Italian orange and pineapple. This delicious fruity concoction is enriched with Peony and Violet to produce a totally feminine yet mysterious scent.The bottle? It's a knock-out as light catches the flashes of purple, yellow and green, all glowing over the rounded glass flacon. It is topped by a spherical green cap above a metallic purple collar. You'll want to keep the bottle long after the fragrance is gone.If you like a scent that is different, makes an impression, this is it. It's also available in shower gel and body lotion for a total Live experience."
5,"If you can only have one book on arms, this is it.","Stone's glossary is the first one I consult whenever I start to research on arms and armor. For many questions it is the last place I need to go. If you can only have one book on the subject, get this one."
2,Hold On!! Warning!,"This notorious work (originally written in the 1920's) has probably done more to retard the accurate presentation and study of arms & armor than any other single work. Repeatedly referenced and re-referenced over and over, this huge book is an outdated and inaccurate resource. Despite its length, coverage, and many rare photos of beautiful weapons, it is a greatly flawed and full of errors. It reflects a lot of just plain wrong and even completely fictional information. Avoid it in favor of more modern refernce works!"
3,An Historically Improtant Book,"Over the many years I have used Stone's Glossary as a reference, I have seldom been disappointed, but then I don't ask too much of it either. Keeping in mind the era in which it was compiled and the biases thereof, I have little difficulty extracting useful information from it when needed. There are many modern references which are more accurate, and certainly the study of arms and armour has produced more informative works. There are few that rival this work in detail of scope, however. Those which cast as broad a cultural net have fewer examples and entries, while those that are more detailed seldom have nearly as many examples from so wide an area.I would highly recommend this book to anyone researching the era for any kind of period fiction or screenplay, especially anything dealing with the height and decline of the British Colonial Empire."
2,Of all places at all times?,"For the author's supposed fixation on 'Oriental' weaponry, he covers absolutely nothing in regards to Chinese weapons. One picture caption talks about a Japanese chain weapon ""Above an unnamed Chinese weapon."" The weapon that is 'unnamed' is a wind and fire wheel, much like the indian chakram, but a very popular wepaon nontheless.His coverage of Indian, Indonesean and Japanese weapons is acceptable, but his coverage of Chinese wepaons, a very significant field as far as warfare is concerned, is lousey at best. ""Of all places places at all times"" isn't an accurate description by a long shot, but it's an easy reference for people looking into european weapons for certain. The fact that it was written originally in the 20s makes for a lack of up-to-date info, but again, it's an easy to use reference"
3,Good Eastern armour: lousy Western armour,"Stone's interest and personal collection are all Eastern and Oriental pieces. Because of this it's a very good refernce for Asian armor and weapons. His examples of Western pieces are from museums, primarily the Met in New York, and other American museums and collections. He makes many errors on European pieces of armor. If your interest is Asian, it's a good book, but it's only adequate as a general reference."
3,Never really pulls you in,"These stories are fine but not great. Many of them are cute. I enjoy literary fiction that is less plot-driven than the average best-seller, but very few of these stories had enough plot to satisfy me. I kept feeling disappointed at the end when nothing happened.This was my first time to read Helen Dunmore. I'd definitely try one of her novels. Her writing is good enough that it intrigued me. I just couldn't get into any of these stories."
5,A wonderful classic,"What more can one say - Evenlyn Waugh is the master of his craft. The dialogue is superb, the characterization is magnificent and the story pulls you right in with its humanness - a wonderful book that will be read forever."
5,Really Enjoyable,"It took me a little while to get into this one. Once, I made it to the third chapter, I was hooked. This is a fantastical novel with a wonderful sense of the absurd. Waugh doesn't seem to be afraid of offending anyone; everybody is fair game. The reader never knows where Waugh is going but its so funny and well written that I didn't care! It goes very quickly and it's hard to like anyone, and, yet, no one is completely unsympathetic. At the end, I was reminded a little bit of Edith Wharton. A sort of sadness crept in, not a lot, just a bit. This novel is completely different from Brideshead Revisited. Although, Brideshead Revisited is one of my favorites, this is an excellent book in itself. I found it to be a complete pleasure to read."
4,Excellent,"If it wasn't for Kindle, I don't think I would have found this in print. An enjoyable read and high recommened."
3,"Somewhat amusing, but not the best.","Well, it's a frothy, surrealistic romp, and had its moments of black humor that made me laugh, but it's hard to believe that it was written by the same person who would eventually give us ""Brideshead Revisited"". As an admirer of Waugh, I'm glad I read it, but I would definitely never read it a second time. The story would probably work better as a screwball comedy on the silver screen."
4,Work great,"Just wish I didn't have to use the adapter to connect it to my PC. My PC has built in memory card slots, but it doesn't handle the super high capacity cards."
5,Extreme III worth the price,"There's memory and then there's memory! The Sandisk Extreme series have always been at the performance edge. After going through Extreme II, III and IV, it appears that Sandisk has decided to move on to the ""Ultra"" moniker to designate the latest and greatest. And so the ""old"" Extreme III cards are showing up in the bargain bins. These ""old"" extreme III cards work very well in my digital cameras!"
4,Great for HD Video,Bought this after I bought my new Panasonic Lumix camera. I found out there is a huge difference between memory cards and the speed they perform. Most cards out there are speed rating of 2 this is a 6 and the price diff is work it. Your camera will shoot and write to the disk much quicker using these.
5,Great card.,Using this card is a breeze. It is so much faster than other memory cards I've used with a read/write speed of 20MBps.
3,Plastic Teeth can Break Easily,"Listen, most people gave enough reviews of speed and whatever, so the only feedback I will try to impart is that there is flimsy plastic on the outside; the teeth that slide to match up with the nine gold tabs on the bottom of these SD cards will break and split from the exterior. I just experienced that tonight. Mine is a Class 6, 30MB/sec edition. This happens when you use them very often. I don't think these are really high-usage shells. And I understand that sliding them in and out on a regular basis will fray and weaken the really slim plastic ribs that separate each tab. Just be careful when you dock your SD card into a reader. Some readers will eat them more than others."
5,Would buy again from this retailer,Very good card and a good price. Received it in a speedy amount of time and would buy from this retailer again.
5,SanDisk Extreme III,SanDisk makes some of the fastest and most reliable cards in the business. This is my 3rd 4GB Extreme III purchase and all are currently in use with my Mikon D80. Transfer rates in-camera and reader mounted have been flawless. Worth the money (and prices have fallen precipitously since my first 4GB card).
5,great addition,The card with the reader is worth the few extra dollars to get. It makes photo sharing or downloading to multiple computers much easier.
5,SD card / cardreader,This item was a great deal and good price. I like the little case it came with.
5,Fast and Awesome Space,Got this to replace my Lexar Professional 133x 1GB card. Seems a little faster and much more space for my Nikon D80 pics.
3,"Good card, bad reader","I put a three stars only because of the reader. The card is great, huge capacity and fast. But too fast for this reader!! It is not a reader that is able to reach the speed of the card, so on your computer you won't transfer pictures as fast as you should. So if you don't care, this pack is for you. Otherwise get one with a fast reader."
5,ROOM TO SPARE,"On a recent trip to Yosemite took close to 400 pics (large jpegs ) in 3 days and wasn""t close to filling the card up."
4,Great for the camera - but not for the new android tablets,"This kind of card came with my Nikon camera, so I bought a 2nd one like it for my upcoming photo trip of some National Parks. It works fast in the camera with no delays when snapping photos. However, my husband bought me a Pandigital tablet to take on this trip and it would not recognize this SD card. A Radio Shack consultant said that the ""extreme"" cards would not work in the Pandigital or Cruz tablets and others like them. These, of course, are not at the high end of such gadgets. A regular 4GB SD card worked fine, but I was not willing to trade off the high speed card for my camera to something less speedy that the tablet would read. So, back went the tablet and I purchased an inexpensive netbook instead (for more $$ of course) This works fine! It may be that the more expensive tablets would read this card, but I wasn't willing to spend more than $200."
5,Excellent!!,"Using this memory card on my canon powershot sx110 IS. I have yet to have a problem with it. Used for snowX, hockey, ect. Works great in the cold and heat. Found it to be very durable and fast. I've owned this card for 3 years and counting. I would definitely recommend this to a friend.,"
5,"Great card, good price","I only use fast cards in my camera, and this card has always worked well for me. That's not much that can go wrong with a memory card like this. I know one other reviewer wrote in that the contacts were breaking on his card - the only way that could have reasonably happened was mishandling of the card, insertion into a device wrong, etc. The plastic tabs between contacts are not a normal contact point on the card.Regardless, this is the only card I buy."
3,Nice card; questionable addons,"Card itself seems fine. I bought this package instead of some of the cheaper standalone cards because I wanted the extras.Sadly the MicroMate card reader is too wide to fit in some USB ports (including those on the front panel of my dell desktop and the side panel of my dell laptop).If the RescuePro software crashes on startup, be sure to go into Windows Data Execution Prevention options and opt-out the rescuepro.exe to resolve the crash."
4,Take lots of pictures,I enjoy digital photography and have high resolution cameras. The price of memory has been coming down dramatically so I was upgrading my cards. [...] I prefer SanDisk cards and have used them regularly. Always high quality and reliable. This was my first purchase from Adorama Camera but it was a pleasant experience. I'll go back to them again.
3,Good at First,"The price was good and it worked fine at first, but the litle locking tab on the side fell off a couple of months after I bought it and now its a challenge to work with my camera and picture files. I had to put a little piece of tape across the gap in order for my camera to take pics and now the files are all read only and won't save or edit correctly. I have a coworker who had the same problem also with the same card."
1,Not Class 10 As Advertised,"This is a Class 6 card, not Class 10, read the fine print. I consider the image of a Class 10 card misrepresentation, and am not happy about that. Other than that, I am sure the card is fine, it's SanDisk after all..."
4,My favorite memory card,"I use this card in my Canon Powershot SX 1 and it works very well. I take mostly nature shots, usually outside and I need a card with a fast write speed. I especially like to use the ""continuous"" shooting feature at 3-4 fps. The images are clear and it works well in cold temperatures and on damp days."
2,Picture issues,I feel like the main picture associated with the item causes it to be very misleading. There is no bundled Micromate reader as the picture indicates.
2,Rino Tech seller Not Trusted SanDisk Cards,"I bough these two 4GB SanDisk extreme III SD cards from Rino Tech as listed new. When they arrived the cards were shipped in flimsy card cases for SD cards not in a SanDisk original box packaging. As a consumer buying something on line the seller should have stated these won't come in original packaging so I the customer won't buy anything thinking this prouduct is ""new"". One of the cards had some sign of use and didn't work properly!! Rino Tech offer to give me a full refund but I figured I can use at lest the the good one as a spare and it wouldn't be a total lost of online buying.**Rino Tech** 2 stars Beware!"
4,Just the place for a Snark!,"'Discrete mathematics is the study of those things left over after you take away limits, convergence, differentiation, and other fun stuff' is the way many texts begin. But this book uses Lewis Carroll and guides you through set theory, history of mathematics, graph theory, things Boolean, combinatorics and models on computation so that, by the end, you have a solid grounding in discrete mathematics. The Lewis Carroll is not an artifact but the form on which the text is built. So if you are in the business of tricking undergraduates into an unnderstanding of mathematical principles before they realize it, this is your guide."
4,It Does The Job,"I would have given this 5-stars except that the image shown doesn't match the product that arrived. The one I received works just fine, but for some applications, the one shown might be preferred, so just be aware.The one shown has a 5/8"" bolt that inserts into the bottom of the ball, so that there are no threads extending below the assembly when applied. The one that arrived has threads that extend from the bottom of the ball and a nut is applied, so that there are threads extending below the assembly. This didn't matter to me, but as stated above, it might in some applications. Of course, you could always cut off any excess threads if necessary.I mounted this on my Snapper LT200 to use my small utility trailer around the yard and to move it up front for use to hook up to vehicles so I don't have to pull it around by hand or drive a vehicle around the house. It does the job!"
2,Great---If your from London,"Although Maureen Waller has produced a good piece of researh it was clearly written for the British, if not London, reader. The information and terminology is very specific to that great city. If you are not completely comfortable with the geography and customs of London, don't read it."
4,This book is ideal for the mechanicaly inclined novice,I purchased the book because I had a gas dryer that I was having trouble fixing. I discovered too late that the book does not cover gas dryers
5,helps me in my studies,this helps as an accompanment to my studies in school and I will keep it as a reference book. It explains things so that even beginners can understand it. I like the way he put it together and the illustrations are a huge help
2,Important but Flat,"This collection is certainly timely, and more like it need to be published. However, with the exception of a few stories (namely those by Guerra and Arroyo), I wasn't too impressed. Some of the contributors are obviously not creative writers which made for frustrating reading. Pick it up, but be on the lookout for future anthologies."
4,a lot of karaoke cdg's for a little money!,"This is a great party pack to get you started on your way to having a lot of karoake fun at homeor out at the clubs. I have really enjoyed the swing cdg, and the standards are a big hit too.The price was fantastic, less than a dollar per cdg! I copied the titles and put them in a notebook foreasy viewing, with this many cdg's this is the way to go. Have fun, I know I am!"
3,Thank you Southpaw,For doing what the seller should have done and listing the included titles. You should get a fee!
2,Nice Seat - VERY bad Hardware,"The seat is very nice and fits the bowl. However, the hardware that comes with it is a joke. The holes to mount the seat are standard and match the Ceramic Bowl perfectly. However, the METAL bolt (that will rust) that comes with the seat is ~1/3 the diameter of the hole (too thin). The washer that comes with the bolt is the correct size so it too slides around inside the bolt.When I sit on a toilet set, I am not looking for any slide around action. So, I took this hardware out and replaced the bolts, etc with the standard nylon/plastic versions that comes with other brands and now all is now well.So, if you buy a kohler seat, expect to also buy the standard nylon (non metal) bolts and nuts also unless you want some slide around action and eventually, RUST."
3,It's Okay,"It is a toilet seat! Elongated style that fits the toilet we have. The color is a nice color but not what I expected. We have the ""weird"" grey color which I thought was called Cashmere but apparently not because the toilet seat in cashmere and the toilet do not match - not even close. However it fits and does what it is suppossed to do. The delivery and the packaging were excellent."
2,Bad mounting hardware,"The seat seems adequate but it's a bit flimsy and thin compared to the seat this one replaced. That one was well made and solid. The mounting hardware is a joke as a previous reviewer wrote. The self centering nuts seem like they should work but don't and are never able to be tightened. I had to buy separate hardware at Lowes. Its a bad design by Kohler, one which I'm sure they will change but not admit. Kohler used to mean quality, now it like most other companies who push product out into the marketplace and ignore the reality of their work."
5,Great service,Our order was acknowledged promptly and delivered early. Would definitely use this company again.
5,"Sublime recording, thank goodness for CD format","This was one of my favorite records from the 1970s, and when the Christmas season rolled around this year, I asked for it from my brother, whose LP I ran flat in playing it over the years. This recording was my introduction to Taj, and to have it in CD form lets me run the bits off it again. Magnificent singing, performances by Howard Johnson, John Hall, John Simon, and the others who played that night.Only ding on this is the CD sleeve - they don't list the songs on the back cover, and inside is just the song list with none of the artists, date, place, nothing. If it is indeed created 'on demand' then we demand that at least the information from the LP be included.You cannot be disappointed with this CD, listen to it all the way thru, you'll be whistling Dixie, or something, the rest of the day."
5,Killer roots music MASTERPIECE,"An epic, sprawling, roots music masterpiece. This is an artistic statement on the level of Tom Sawyer or The Invisible Man (Ralph Ellison). The power in this music is the way it captures the chaos and tenderness of life in an utterly transcendent and inexplicable way. May sound strange to modern ears, so used to the polished and predictable tropes of the likes of *ahem* lyle lovett, or lucinda williams. This ain't no lucinda williams. This is one of the most slept on albums of all time (IMHO)- if you're one of the millions who bought the Oh Brother soundtrack (not knocking it, I happen to like the album) take it to the next level and check out this wonderful album.Favorite track: You Ain't No Streetwalker Mama, But I Sure Do Love the Way You Strut Your Stuff.Epic"
4,Trekking and Climbing in Nepal,The description of this book was mis-represented to me.I searched for books containing 3D photos or photography.The description allowed this book contained the same.IT DID NOT!It is an excellent book for its intended genre and is a nice addition to your coffee table or guest shelf if interested in the genre.
3,Another Upper Edmonton Gardens romp.,"This latest in the Mrs. Jeffies series is another romp with the staff from Upper Edmonton Gardens. The book is light and fun, and the characters are still just as likeable. In this book though, their beloved Inspector Witherspoon is a suspect in a murder case. It's up to the staff to clear his name. And even though she knows he didn't commmit this terrible crime, Mrs. Jeffries knows that Inspector Witherspoon is keeping something from her. Lots of good, clean fun."
1,Did not receive item,I did not receive this book. I wrote and received a response that had nothing to do with not getting the book. I finally made my point and was assured by the vendor that they would send the book that day. I still have not received the book.I would like to get my money back so I can order the book from another vendor. How do I get a refund?
2,Weak,"Awesome soundtrack. Odd story. The preview looked funny, but there were just a few ""good parts"". Tried hard to enjoy this movie, but it just didn't click."
4,Great Indie Film,"This is a great movie, especially if you are in to independent films. I saw it in the theatre, and loved it. Joseph Gordon Levitt, and the other cast members were great! But it's not a movie for everyone. If you even got to the point where you are reading this review, you would probably like it. It's fraught with hidden innuendos and undertones. Loved it enough to buy it. It's dark, it's funny, it's sad, it's awesome!"
4,Intense,"If Hesher had to be described in one word, that word would be Intense. Almost every scene involves physical violence, shouting matches, vandalism, pyromania, bullying, anarchy, and general misery. The only feel-good moment is when granny gets high off a bong. That's not to say the film is bad. It just might be overwhelming for those who aren't accustomed to nonstop mayhem and sorrow. Dark humor was sprinkled throughout...it was funny enough to generate a few chuckles, but it didn't do much to take the edge off. Devin Brochu turned in a masterful performance. He can't be more than 13 years old. He has a bright future ahead of him. Hesher might seem like a big ole mess, but there's a message somewhere amid the chaos. It gets better after repeat viewings."
3,CKY as a drama.,"I actually thought this was hilarious and Joseph Gordon Levitt was amazing, but it still falls into the category of ""just okay."" In college I laughed at really stupid stuff like Bam Margera's CKY movies and this had those moments. It's just awesome to see the Hesher character doing, well, what Hesher would do. Plus, I loved the use of Metallica. The movie does change it's tones from this crazy guy comedy to a serious ""needing to move on drama,"" but it was enjoyable. I wouldn't personally own it myself but it's a movie I may watch multiple times with anybody who hasn't seen it yet."
3,Outside the Main Stream,"This film is extremely disturbing with Joseph Gordon-Levitt playing a foul mouthed street person who shuns all forms of main stream society. Director, Spencer Susser, also seems to shun main stream movie making in introducing one the most interesting and offensive anti-heroes of all time. Imposing himself on a dysfunctional family that has not been able to overcome the loss of daughter, wife and mother, Hesher (Gordon-Levitt) becomes an influential force in their journey back from the edge. Natalie Portman has a limited but extremely well acted role as part time store cashier who does not make enough money to pay the rent, buy food and repair a seriously past its prime auto. Many viewers may be put off by the language and some of the actions of the main character but the message at the end is clear and offers some amount of hope for a group of hopeless people."
2,Interesting Ending but tough time to get through it,"The ending of the movie had an interesting twist and tied up some lose ends making this movie not completely a waste of time. However, between the first hour leaving everything to be desired and the middle being an utterly ridiculous series of events without any real meaning, this movie leaves a lot to be desired. Actors all did a good job portraying what the movie had to offer, the script just offered little. It took me three sittings to get through this one."
2,"Great actors, mid-grade plot.",I purchased this movie based on actors involved. Not one of their best by any means. I love independent films but this was just mediocre.
3,Just OK.,"I am not sure why, but this movie just didn't work for me. Extremely well cast. Not sure where this movie stumbled. My daughter did not care for the young actor that played T.J. and thought the movie focused too much on him. It did not seem to flow smoothly and was a bit choppy in the editing."
2,"Dark, depressing with minimal substance","Not sure what others saw in this film. Pretty depressing, not realistic and I hated the Hesher character. Save your money and rent something more uplifting like the new Xman movie."
5,BEST MOVIE EVER,One of my all time favorite movies. Had to buy it. I could watch it over and over again and have ha
1,load up on Prozac first.,"This movie was ugly. Not only was the vocabulary ugly and disgusting, but the characters were empty,losers. What was the point? Depressing.If there are really people like that on earth, the human race is lost and I don't want to know."
1,Horrifically bad... serious spoiler alert,"Wow....I don't think I've ever seen a worse movie. It had potential. Interesting ingredients...kinda cool character in Hesher, but in the end it just self-destructed into meaningless pointless drivel.Other people have reviewed the story so I'll just point one thing out that struck me as particularly stupid. The whole point is that the kid and family is going through tough times because the mother died. So at the funeral of the grandmother (who also dies), a drunk Hesher lectures the father and son about how they need to appreciate what they have left. He does this by comparing the fact that he lost a testicle in an accident and was feeling sorry for himself until he realized he had one good one left. And this didn't come across as humor..it just came across as really bad taste.It's been a long time since I've seen this level of stupid in a film."
1,Hesher,"I cannot imagine what anyone found entertaining about this movie. It has a idiotic story line with innumerable implausible situations, and at best, depressing. Even in fast forward mode the movie was slow paced. I agree with the reviewer who said ""I kind of felt like I deserved an apology for the two hours I wasted on this depressing mess."" A waste of time and $3."
1,lol,im surprised Lars Ulrich hasn't sued for the rights of the lightning bolt font yet. seeing as the world owes him a living.
1,Foulmouth pointless trash!,"Foulmouth pointless piece of trash! It had no point and no message that I see. Enough said! If you are thinking of renting/buying this movie, consider yourself warned."
1,Indie Cliche Overload,"A casino bet that puts all it's chips on this angry stoner randomly squatting in this numb grieving family's house. The problem is he's miscast, poorly written, poorly acted, poorly directed, unlikeable, and uninteresting. Somebody's rich influential daddy must have come up with the 7 million bucks to pressure good actors to do this rehash."
1,Terrible in every way,"You kinda get what the director was going for here -- trying to do a reverse role model story with a badass rocker dude as the role model who ultimately redeems himself despite his anti-everything behavior. Did not work at all. I rented this because of the interesting cast and some reviewer called it ""hilarious."" That reviewer was clearly under the influence of serious narcotics, because there was exactly one laugh in the entire film. And the cast is utterly wasted. Rainn Wilson spends most of the movie in a catatonic state, Natalie Portman is mousey (if you can believe that) and Joseph Gordon Leavitt is doing his best Jesus Christ impersonation, but without the winning charm. Avoid this one too. Nothing redeeming about it."
1,Bad movie,Hard to have any feelings for the titled name character. Gordon-Levitt is good as always in a very bad film.
3,Very Different...,"This movie was very interesting, not what I expected from the title at all. I don't think I would watch it again. But when I was watching it I did not want to turn it off. Weird role for Natalie Portman and it was kind of a sad movie."
2,annoying kid,"I'm a big metallica fan and i'm a big joseph gordan levitt fan so i was really looking foward to watching this, however I watched half an hour of this movie and had to turn it off. it wasnt that the movie was bad i was actually enjoying it but the little blond hair kid i taught was just really annoying so i had to turn it off."
3,Life with Hesher,"I've known guys like Hesher. Chain-smoking, tattooed, long-haired, stoner douche-bags. It's easy to instantly dislike Joseph Gordan-Levitt playing said douche-bag, but of course, this the movies and life-lessons must be learned, so Hesher turns out to be an o-k guy, just with douche-y (sic) qualities.Life is in major suck mode. Young T.J. (Brochu) and his Dad (Wilson) are in mourning. Along comes Hesher (Gordan-Levitt) an uninvited guest, who makes himself at home in their garage. Grandma (the terrific Piper Laurie) doesn't mind at all, in fact, no one seems to mind. T.J. has a crush on a check-out girl (Portman) and they form a friendship. All of these lives intertwine throughout, leading the story into humility, sadness, and redemption.Hesher is a sweet film. Nothing Earth-shattering, by any means, but a semi-quiet (except when inside Hesher's heavy metal van) story about dealing with life. The cast does a great job with director Susser's debut film.Worth a rental."
5,Dark but very cool!!,Dark movie I could not what to see what he would do next.I just wonder who's house Hesher will be visiting next. I watch alot of movies I would say this one is in my top five this year.
2,Really dark,"Count me as one that just didn't ""get it"". I rented this based on the reviews here. Well,... there is a lot of inappropriate sexual aggressiveness between the kid actor and the bully and even Hesher. Does this kind of talk make it real? Maybe to some, but it creeped me out... to the point where I found it unwatchable in parts. I kept FF through looking for a redeeming theme and found none. It's just a darky, moody and humorless effort that really had me wondering what the hell were they thinking when they made this ."
3,"Amazing scientist, unexceptional writer.","Without a doubt Tim Flannery ranks with the world's greatest scientist/explorers. He has a wealth of fascinating and valuable tales to tell from his travels to New Guinea. However, the book has little coherent structure. It's just a series of (mostly) unrelated stories, like he might recount over dinner. The details of his trips are incredible, but by the time I was half way through, I began losing my interest and felt I was re-reading previous passages."
3,Why the obsession with genitals?,"I suppose the sub-title should have warned me, but I wondered why Flannery could not seem to write more than a page or two without referring to the male genitals. Otherwise this is an interesting book, which gives a rather stark picture of the conditions in PNG. It also raised interesting questions about the introduction of western values to a primitive culture, which on the one hand is in need of some civilising in terms of the cannibalism, the massacring of villages and the subjection of women, while on the other hand is need of preserving vis a vis religious and cultural beliefs. Did anyone else wonder if Father Michaelhod really was a pederast?"
5,full of stuff I never knew - or imagined - about New Guinea,"Aside from all I learned about another culture and mammals I had never heard of, I was impressed by the author's vocabulary. I did manage to find ""ensorcell"" in my Oxford complete dictionary, but does anyone know what ""farcarted"" means? as in ""they ate until they were farcarted."" Not in my dictionaries."
1,Just horribly disturbing,"I'm sorry but I couldn't get past the first 30 pages. Between the misogynist Neanderthal Catholic priest and horrible explicit descriptions of animal cruelty I had had enough. This type of behavior might be normal for these people but you know what it is not what I consider enjoyable reading, to say the least."
4,"Very readable, incomparable discovery","I'd like to add my vote to those that reviewed this favorably. This is one of those books you read that cause other family members to comment ""can you put that book down for a second and look at this"". And you will respond by ""Wait a second, listen to this!"".Flannery as mentioned in above reviews is no James Mitchner but his travels and discoveries are more novel and less attainable to those that would not put up with malaria, scrub typhus, parasites, hunger, miserable weather and a hundred other obstacles that exist in exotic Papau New Guinea and Irian Jaya.If you get this book arrange for some blocks of free time as you won't want to be interrupted. You also may want to have a map available as you journey along with Flannery."
5,LOVE!,"Brought back so many memories. What a great video, especially for the time. I thought the sound and video was great!"
2,Heart Attack!!!,"Here's my review: short and simple. A DVD should have superb sound and video quality, this DVD has good sound and video quality. The scrapbook montage is deleted from the intro, which was present on the VHS version. For those of us who went to this tour, that's how the concert started. When you hit play, it abruptly starts with Olivia bursting out of the curtains. It was poorly done, and should have stayed as the original VHS version was. One should not have to go to the special features section to see this. Hopefully another video company will release this video the way it should have been, with true special features. At the very least, a discography section. This lazily made video almost gave me a heart attack!!"
2,Interesting item for long-time fans,"What a blessing, to have this artifact from Newton-John's days as a live concert artist. As I watched this video recently, I wonder what Olivia might think to see this- Surely she'd smile at the long-ago image of herself as a live performer on stage, only slightly past her prime as a top songbird of the 1970s. Casual fans might howl at some of the constumes and non-hit LP filler tracks being churned here. But for those rare few who absorb Olivia's each sigh as a penny from heaven, you'll find something delightful with this long forgotten concert. I for one am glad to see it preserved before the original sources decomposed from age...imagine if this had been lost forever, rotting away in a storehouse with other forgotten efforts of the 1980s- Perish the thought!"
1,NOt Happy,This is NOT the animal that is sent.... The one they mail you is mostly white with a few spots..Split colored face and hardly any other colors on him... Few large brow spots. I am not pleased at all... When you show a photo of something... That should be what you get.... VERY MISLEADING.... The dog I received is on another website listed as an English Pointer... Which makes more sense. Not at all like the picture in the photo. When I called they said it was a photo but not actual animal mailed. this is gonna cost a fortune to mail back...
5,Cute dog!,"My daughter loves this large, realistic dog. Its face is white with brown spots, not all brown as in the picture. It seems to have wire strengthening its legs, so it's not floppy (though my 6-year-old can't ride on it)."
5,Melissa & Doug German Shorthaired Pointer,Very well made & beautiful. This toy is so real that even real dogs really think it's another dog at small distances.
4,Melissa & Doug Plush dogs,"The quality is great, it is durable and is really realistic detailed. We have a springer spaniel and wanted a plush dog that looked like him to see his reaction and just to have because it is so cute. The German shorthaired pointer looks so much like our springer and when we opened the box he thought it was real and wanted to play, lick and bark at it. We had to put it up high because he wouldn't leave it alone!"
4,Bob Jacklin,A fantastic DVD for the beginner or pro. I've been tying for 40+ years and picked up some great new ideas.
1,An Embarassing Report,"This book explains why it took so long to catch the sniper from the last paragraph on page 221 through page 223. Incompetence. The rest is a lot of whining by Moose. On page 226 he complains about how ""inconvenient"" it is to change out of uniform before going home although that is not required. Later he admits he was stopped for speeding and that his wife has been stopped multiple times! Great behavior for a chief of police. He is ""victimized"" by racial profiling. Hey so is every black person in this country. On page 288 he says Bush made a congratulatory phone call on the capture of the snipers. Moose whines that Bush should have made a personal visit. He left his job so he could write this book. Maybe that's a good thing. I must get the Horwitz book now to read the real story."
1,A Sad Endeavor,"Mr. Moose provides a sad reflection on this terrible reign of terror. Possibly if he invested more time in the writing of the book, some meaningful passages and information may have been included within the book's covers. If only to question his blind response to those first witnesses who reported the dark sedan and it's passengers leaving the scene of the first shooting, or of the near universal disrespect of his fellow officers.The book is poorly developed and written as shown by its ranking of appr. 7500 on the Amazon list today. Mr. Moose might do well to examinehis inner self, rather than write of his imagined leadership."
1,Miserable book,"This is a racist book written by a black officer who writes about himself and travails. I expected a well written book with insight into the investigation and the events. Instead, I bought one of those ""we are all victims"" books."
1,What a waste!,"Oh please! Moose is so full of himself! He didn't run the investigation, the FBI did. In fact, the FBI had to take it over because he was botching the case. He is trying to make money off of the hardships that we the citizens of the metro underwent last year. I am shocked they even published this book. For shame, Moose."
1,MOOSE POOP!!,"Thankfully, this horrible, opportunistic, self serving, greed driven gathering of semicoherent thoughts and ego driven, never ending chapters can be put to rest. The previous review seems to say much about this self serving man who tried to take credit for all of the hard working, talented, public service minded Law Enforcement Officers who worked long hours and in dangerous situations to track down and capture the sick individuals who perpetrated these horrendous crimes. This book doesn't even deserve to be at the ranking of 11,950 which it is at this time.Precious Thanks are given to those who really solved this crime in their quiet professional ways. As for the book and it's author, enough said in the title."
1,Most disappointing book I have ever read!,"I would have never have purchased this book for myself after watching Moose's interview on 60 minutes. However, my wife purchased it for me without my knowledge and I must say that every penny spent was truly wasted. This book has very little to do with the sniper killings. It is much more focused on Moose's life and the trials and triumphs of being a black man in America.Moose gives examples in every other paragraph of how he has been mistreated, harassed, victimized and disrespected because he was an african american.If you would like to learn of details, investigative methods and other inside information on the sniper investigation you'd be better off of doing a simple query on the internet than purchasing this book.I must admit I had somewhat respect for Moose during the investigation, but am now truly disappointed."
1,Three Weeks in the Life of Charles Moose,"The title is disengenuous. I worked under Moose in Portland. The book is all about his travails. You might call it a personal saga of one man's tearful life. That was about all he did well - cry on que. Oh - he could get angry on que also. Blister you up one side and down the other for any conceivable slight that he figured you might be guilty of.He seemed to always carry a chip on his shoulder, and figured that most white guys were prima facie racist.Guy is a walking, simmering stewpot. Can't write either. Only reason he made the big time was due to an ultra liberal, white-guilt ridden mayor by the name of Vera Katz."
2,Nothing more to know about from this book,"I was really looking foward to reading this book. Yet having been glued to the media like everyone else during these three weeks, there was never more I learned about the investigation, profile etc of the snipers. This was more like an autobiography of Chief Moose. At times how he became Chief was interesting but mostly very dry and hard to keep focus jumping back and forth between topics about himself then back to the investigation."
1,What an utter racist moron,"About the only two things one can conclude from this book are Moose is a racist, and Moose is a moron. It is a tale, told by an idiot, and not much of one at that.It is clear from the book that Moose is not a particularly adept policeman. He displays a penchant for suing people, possesses the aura of an ""angry black man,"" and on top of everything else can't write a coherent narrative, even with a co-author's help.I wonder if Mr. Moose is going to sue Charles Fleming when the critics pan this abysmal book."
1,Wanting to be a hero,"I live literally 5 minutes away from the scence of the second shooting, and my grandmother's apartment was about 5 yards from the scence of another shooting. This is my home. So I figured that this book could prove interesting. Bah, humbug. Moose makes everytihng out to seem as if he was hero, ignoring the fact that there was no white box van, and the witnesses who described the actual car were ignored. What's worse is that publication of the book could screw up the sniper trials (at least in Maryland), and he violated every ethics law on the books. He wasn't that great of a police chief before the shootings, and he was even worse during and afer them. Buy the book if you want to hear about a man who wasn't even liked by his own officers."
1,Disappointing and Off the Subject,"As a resident of the target area, I had hoped to learn what was going on ""behind the scenes"" as we watched the news reports. Instead the chief's book seemed to center on his personal life, his disappointments, and his problems with his perceptions of racial bias in this country. I'm sorry he resigned his job as Chief of Police. He was well liked in the police department. I think he was a much better policeman than an author."
4,An Honest Portrayal,"I worked with Charles Moose in Portland and know him to be an honest, dedicated professional man, loyal to his friends. This book is a brutally honest portrayal of the man and his beliefs. At a time when the entire nation was focused on his actions, he made us all proud of his professionalism and his humanity. The book is a bit disjointed because it skips back and forth between Portland and Montgomery County. It would have been better to have it chronologically. However, the information about his early life and his climb to the level of chief and then the sniper situation does give a complete picture of this dedicated law enforcement professional.(Charles Moose wrote the introduction to my autobiography, Triumph of Spirit, available on Amazon.com)"
4,"Good for you, Moose!","I commend Moose for writing this book. I guess I don't really understand why so many people read his story and then complain that it wasn't all about the sniper investigation. Moose clearly states on the jacket of the book that it is an autobiography of his life, and how he became interested in law enforcement and pursued this career successfully, as well as how he came to lead the historical hunt for the killers in the sniper investigation. I don't think the book would have the substance it does, were it not for the inclusion of Moose's background.I enjoyed reading about Moose's personal life; his childhood, his family, and his becoming a police officer, and climbing the ranks to become chief in both Portland and Montgomery County.Moose did what he felt he had to do, or needed to do in writing this book. Who are we to criticize his decision?"
2,Let Down By Chief Moose,"I could not wait until this book was released. I got it the day it was realesed, I Really don't Understand Chief Moose's Comment's in the book on alot of thing's.. I do think the man does have alot of anger in him. I was really Susprised about the part in the book about Were the Road's were marked as Martin Luther King Jr Boulevard. That was a very unfair statement.Travel to Florida Chief Moose I will Asure you that You will be in the best of Area's here on that street Because most of the street's run together with his name. Very nice town's too.I feel as though this book was more on Race Issues then the Sniper Shooting's. I am Shocked that you have yet to this day never faced the monsters that did the shotting's on your watch.I'm Afraid Of PoliceMen too. So I don't think I would want to be stopped By This One."
1,Class or Trash?,"Greed is what led Chief Moose to write this book. He quit his job as chief of police to write it, because ethics/rules prohibited his writing a book about those terrifying days in October. So, he quit his job. He goes on and on in this book about all his problems and racism, but this man quit his job as chief of police to write this book. Am I missing something here? A black man who is chief of police in an area near Washington DC, and I'm supposed to feel sorry for him?It wouldn't matter the race of this police chief. If they showed such a willingness to throw ethics to the wind, and showed they really didn't care about their job, wrote a book, half about the tragic days in October, half personal whine, that is a huge turn-off. Its no wonder this book is on the bargain tables."
2,Not funny,"The no-name comedians at the beginning were funny, Bea Arthur killed, and the dumpy lady at the end who kept talking about how African-Americans used to dig her backside but don't any longer was funny. Courtney Love's antics were amusing but grew tiresome. The rest of the roast was horrible. Telling Tommy Lee that his genitals are the envy of barnyard animals is not an insult. And, after it's repeated ad nauseum, it's not funny either.Has Andy Dick ever been funny? Kimmel? Corolla? Sarah Silverman? Spade post-Farley? No. It's as if Comedy Central corralled the most unfunny comedians of the past 10 years.And the bonus features are horrible. The interviewer was annoying--even the guests seemed annoyed with her.Was Gilbert Gottfried not available? That guy is funny."
1,ropast of a nunt he factor a dumb roast,this film will be realesed on february 14 2006why put the pamela anderson roast thing ondvd its nuts whoes gonna wonna just see the samekind roast the roast isnt even that funny its actualy preferd stupid idotic
5,Freakin' Funny,"This roast is soo unbelievebly funny, even if you don't like her. You have to see this for the train wreck that is Courtney Love."
3,Raunchy....!,The REAL version of the Comedy Central classic without the bleeps. Fun to watch uncensored but I don't think I'd check it out more than once
1,BAAAAAADDDD,Boo this is nothing like the book upon which it was based this movie is so far off you can't recognize the story at all read the book don't waste your time on yhe movie
2,1 1/2 for a movie that's hard to enjoy,"'Slapstick of another kind' is a movie that could have been good if it took itself a little bit more seriously, or didn't rely so much on childish behaviour and special effects.The plot is so hard to follow and, well, it's not as if the movie really cares about the plot too much, rather, it relies on some childishness from Jerry Lewis, that is 'Wilbur' and his sister 'Eliza', played by Madeline Kahn. Actually, I was enjoying the movie more before you meet 'Wilbur' and 'Eliza' - the Chinese are funny in this movie, and it was interesting to see a movie from 30 years ago reflect today's political climate.Once you get into the laborious details about the twins and their 'eccentric-looking-but-not-funny' carers, the movie is rather dull."
1,Slapstick of Another Kind,"I saw part of this film on TV years ago. Jerry Lewis should have known better than to make fun of retarded people, as he has done in this film. Both Jerry and Madeline Kahn play mentally challenged offspring. It is so horrible to watch. They wear wigs, make stupid noises. It's embarrassing. I shut it off -- I couldn't take it anymore.Guess what: I'm a rabid Jerry Lewis fan."
3,American Propaganda,"This is a rare inside look at American democratic propaganda, it could have more in dept propaganda about the the Soviet Union, but decent no less!"
3,Krusell Multidapt horizontal case,"The product is of high quality and securely holds my Garmin IQ-3600. There is one MAJOR drawback: the material is very stiff, making it difficult to raise the flap and hold it up while the Garmin is inserted into the case. While attempting to do so there is heightened concerned that pressure from the cover attempting to self-close due to material stiffness will cause me to drop the Garmin. Bottom line: I'm not comfortable using this product. Given 20-20 hindsight I probably would not have purchased this otherwise excellent product."
4,Classic,"One of the great classic melodies from Nino Rota. If you like soundtracks and Fellini's movies, this is a must."
1,Instrumental please,"This music is listed as instrumental, the cd would be great -- IF THEY HAD NOT IDIOTICALLY INCLUDED SINGERS. DUH - it's supposed to be instrumental!"
1,I really didn't like it!,"My friend's mom had this book. I read some of it, and it wasn't very good. There were spelling mistakes, and they put commas and things in the wrong places! My teacher would give them an F if she saw it. She gave me an F when I wrote like that. :("
5,AWESOME!!!,"BATTLE SCENES IN THIS MOVIE ROCK!!! Couple of parts scared the crap outta me and the dialog was very witty, funny, and it made you feel for the characters I WOULD GIVE 6 STARS IF I COULD"
3,An impressive feat...,"I'm a huge advocate for this film for a number of reasons. 1: it takes on an issue that I don't think people in liberal hollywood take seriously enough: the idea of homegrown terrorists. 2: The festival I saw this at (Burbank), it was rumored that the dude made it for less than $25,000 out of pocket.On face value, it's an indie film, but it looks like a high-end indie film. Looks like the budget would have been at least 500,000 or so. What these guys did with what they had is a testament to their drive. I'm just downright impressed.Oscar-worthy? no. The type of movie you can kick back on a Saturday afternoon and watch... absolutely. Better than everything on cable... I suggest watching it..."
3,Not what I expected,"After reading ""Point of Impact,"" I was really excited about diving into this Hunter work about a German soldier, Repp, skilled in long range shooting, who is on a dangerous mission and has in his possession a very dangerous state of the art weapon to fulfill it.The book gets a little confusing because there are so many German towns, phrases, organizations, etc that it becomes hard to keep track of them througout the reading. Also, the romantic scene between the hero who hunts down Repp, Leets, and a nurse becomes more distracting and really has no relevance to the story. The action scenes were quite entertaining, however, and the book was hard to put down in the last 100 pages.It was a decent book but I think I'll stick with the ""Swagger"" series from now on."
2,ho hum,"I am a huge fan of the swagger series (both earl and bob) and i was really let down by this book. the writing was trite, the characters lifeless, the ending stupid and predictible, the story-line unrealistic. hunter's forte certainly is not ww2....it is puzzling to me that a man who can write books as good as pale horse coming and point of impact, wrote this mediocre fluff."
4,Good story line,"Good story line with an unexpected target, but it is logical that such acts were committed during the war and others,"
3,Good but not his best,"As many of the other reviewers have stated, this book feels like a first-time author testing the waters. It's worth reading for sure but I personally enjoy some of the later titles a little more.After reading the first hundred pages or so I set this down for a while and came back to it. It picks up in the second half of the story when the plot is actually starting to become somewhat clear. And when the full scope of the assassinaion plot is revealed it is quite unique. My main problem is with certain characters that seem to pop up and then go nowhere. There's a love story thrown in here for awhile that just kind of...disappears. Hmmm.I would recommend this to those who've read other Hunter books but, for the first-timer, check out Dirty White Boys or another title in the Swagger series."
5,A must read for action/thriller lovers.,This is a fantastic book that was nearly impossible to put down. This was the first Hunter book I read and now I am addicted.
3,Early work shows potential of writer who created Bob Swagger,"The earliest works of Tom Clancy were criticized as ""techno-thrillers"" in which the author forgot to put the people inside the machines. The same criticism can be leveled at ""The Master Sniper""--but there's an important difference.The antagonist in this novel is Krepp, the Meisterschutze, or Master Sniper, who is admittedly a soulless robot. It is not until Hunter's later works that we learn that this soullessness is an important component of the personality of a successful sniper. ..But his protagonists, both American and British, are an interesting mix of heroic impulses and all-too-human flaws. Thriller readers who know anything at all about firearms are accustomed to seeing novels which are rife with mistakes about the nature and effect of small arms. Don't expect to see any of these mistakes in Hunter's work. An avid shooter as well as an author, Hunter's love of guns and shooting shines through in all his books."
2,Mr. Hunters First and Worst,"If I had read this book first I never would have read the others which are mostly excellent. The protagonist is a total idiot and not someone to identify with at all. No character development at all and really a stupid story. Don't waste your money.With that said I highly recommend his ""Dirty White Boys"", ""Point of Impact"" and the Bob Swagger series."
2,This book does not hold up to his other works.,"After having read ""Point of Impact"", ""Dirty White Boys"" and ""Black Light"", I was disappointed with this title. The characterization is lacking--I found the ""bad guy"" more interesting than heroes. The target of the master sniper seems a little hard to believe. There were portions of the book (such as the tennis sequence) that left me thinking ""why was that in the story?"". If anyone reads this novel and is disappointed, they should give the Bob Lee stories a chance."
2,Ending is a big let down,"I thought the first 3/4 of this book was entertaining. I was interested in how the German weapon was being created and,most importantly, its ultimate target. I also found most of the characters somewhat interesting.Let's just say, without giving anything away, that the ending is stupid and not worth the wait. I could come up with at least ten reasons how the ending could have been avoided and probably another ten more interesting targets. After reading the ending, I wished I hadn't wasted my time on the first 3/4."
2,Glad I gave Hunter another chance.,"This book has interesting points in the story, and the main character is definitely the most interesting. I found his lonely trek across war torn Europe to be the most captivating part of the book. However, the main fault that keeps this book from being very good is the object of the mission. For some reason, I just do not find it to be particularly believable. For those who read this and find it as unbelievable as I, read The Day Before Midnight. It is militarily fake, but the story is inifinitely better"
4,Stephen Hunter is worth reading.,"Stephen Hunter paints a vivid visual picture of his characters and their settings and ties them all together one piece at a time keeping the chapters in chronological order as he gives you the information needed and lets the characters and the story unfold in your mind as you read on. Sometimes I had to go back to look at something I may have glossed over and cement the importance of the facts in my mind but it is very easy to do. I like how he takes factual historical events and weaves his story within that framework, giving you the opportunity to say ""what if"". I read a later work of his and wanted to go back and see what his early works were like and I am not disappointed."
4,Bulls Eye,"Thoughtfully crafted, and based on fact, Stephen Hunter has show us the sniper from several angles. The original, Carlos Hathcock, would have been proud. A very good read."
2,mediocre at best,Have enjoyed Hunter's novels in the past. This is not one of his better efforts. Plot took forever to take shape and then dragged on to a rather unbelievable conclusion....would not recommend
2,average,This was a disappointment after having read some of Hunter's other work. Some improvements on technical points versus previous books. The story is best described as flat
4,Not what I expected,"After reading a number of the Earl and Bob Lee Swagger books I was expecting something similar and this book is not. It is a very good World War II thriller and a book I enjoyed. The book didn't have the tough swagger of the tough hard bitten good old boys named Swagger and almost felt like someone other than Stephen Hunter wrote the book, but it was a good action thriller and certainly is recommended to anyone looking for a good read."
3,Okay but not great,"I have not read many WWII stories, fiction or non, so this was a bit different for me. I did enjoy the book, but it does not compare to 'Point of Impact' or 'Time to Hunt'. Even though the ending was predictable, I would still recommend this as a good (and quick) read."
4,A good WWII fiction read..,"This story was great in respect to its' plot and characters. Leets is a hero for all of us of a similar description. Repp appeared soulless, yet seemed to be trying to obtain one. Schumel had the soul, but seemed destined for the higher place for which he was prepared. The remaining characters blended well with the plot and the main characters. My only question is the time line. The whole scenario is completed in such a short period of time. From the smallest piece of evidence to the ending seems unrealistic for 1945. Other than that limitation, this is an excellent read for those who enjoy WWII mystery and intrigue."
3,Above average thriller,"Tha Master Sniper is a solid book, however it is a little devoid of characters that you really care about. You spend a lot of time with the robot-like NAZI sniper who isn't that interesting. It is worth reading, but if you've read Point of Impact you may be disappointed."
3,Master Sniper Missed Shots.,"This was 4th Hunter book(Time to Hunt, Havana, Pale Horse Coming and this one) I've read.The book was pretty usual Hunter good, up until the last few pages when, all of sudden,the ""Master"" sniper turned into a jayshooter.Not so great compared to other Hunter books.Can someone explain why the German snipermissed the shots in the final scene, please?I just don't understand how that happened(won't narrate it for fear of spoiling).Thanks,"
3,Drama on the seashore,A family drama of a child abuse victim-fresh widower-in-his-sixties trying to reconnect with offspring - biological gay and adopted Afro-American sons- is so boring that just big funs of a gender might get intrigue pleased with.
4,No fragrence to IRRITATE....eh guys? Yeah.....the best !,"Nivea knew how to make us guys happy.....here the fragrence is almost absent, although there is a scent that is very mild and pleasing. Also, if you let it set for about 3-5 minutes, it really smoothes out your skin and lubricates your face. Very protective moisturizers......excellent choice.Edge and Gillette are gone from my cabinet.......messy, and the scent is irritataing. Ah! Owch.....The NIVEA Shave Gel ""MILD"" version (blue can, not like this one...which is white) with a fragrence is good.......irritated my skin, but still a good shave......"
5,Excellent and inexpensive,"I bought this on a whim recently at Target. I had always followed my father's shaving ritual of inexpensive razors and shaving cream, combo of Bic single disposable and Barbasol sensitive skin.My wife and daughter bought me a kit from the art of shaving including a brush, shaving soap and and a lighted power handle for the Gillette power fusion. I always felt like the razor dragged across my face wheter I used the shaving soap from the brush, edge, or Barbasol I basically hid from my wife that I was using Bic Razors instead of her gift. After using this product, the razor glides like a ski over my face, no irritation at all, and a very close shave. the only negative is that it requires quite a bit of pressure on the valve, and usually wind of with too much product. At this price, it really doesn't matter."
5,Take care of your face,"I've come to realize that after using cheap razors with shaving cream and now using this gel with a Mach 3, what the heck was I thinking trying to save a few dollars. Spend the extra money on a good razor and a good gel like Nivea. I don't dread shaving now."
1,Stinky!,"I bought this stuff because my wife hates stinky men's products and the can said it was ""fragrance-neutral"". Silly me. I figured ""fragrance-neutral"" meant that it was lightly-scented or not scented at all. I couldn't have been more wrong. If you're the kind of guy who likes to slap on about a quart of Brut before you walk out the door in the morning, this stuff will fit right in. Otherwise, avoid it. The effect is like smearing a big dab of cologne right under your nostrils and then having to live with the persistent stink for the rest of the day. I got a great shave from this stuff, but the fragrance was too strong, and it doesn't go away. A full day and a couple of face washes later, and I can still smell it."
3,Not what I expected,"I have always been facinated with etchings as a form of art and I have been searching for a comprehensive book on the etchings of Wenceslaus Hollar, one of the most talented etchers of the time... perhaps ever. However, when I read the description of the book it was always missing the section on how many illustrations are in the book. I suppose I should have been keyed in by the title... which says ""A descriptive Catalogue...""... but I could not imagine it was possible that an art book could exist with no illustrations. So I ordered it... and lo and behold... it is in fact an art book with zero (0) illustrations. Only descriptive text of each of his 2700 works. While I imagine it is important to have such a catalogue for his works, I can not understand who the target audience for this book would be... except perhaps the holder of the collection of the actual art. A book on art, without the actual art, is not interesting to me."
4,Powerful read,"Reading the personal experience of the author shows the power of God in our daily lives as well as reveals the deceiver that Satan really is. Clint Byars really brings home the personal responsibility of the free will that God has given us, especially when dealing with the influence that the world and Satan have in our lives. Excellent read that will change how you see God and Satan. Highly recommended!"
2,Lacks Focus,"I thought this book lacked focus and detail. Its basically a collection of thoughts from a number of so called ""Pros"" who use various methods and comment on what I consider to be the basics. I didn't buy it looking for handicapping advice(which is fortunate it has none)but I did expect some detail about wagering based on the books title. Instead it is a bunch of philisophical ramblings from a few well known handicappers and some who chose not to be identified. You'll laugh,(not really) you'll cry, you'll kiss 20 bucks goodbye. I can't reccomend it."
3,Solid advice with a different approach,"This isn't a book that will greatly improve your handicapping, but it does explore the insights of professional gamblers and how they are able to make a living in the game. I found this was a more relaxing read than usual handicapping books that keep my nose in the pages for fear of missing some nugget of information. Though the subject matter is a group of professionals, it works for the recreational handicapper who gains a better understanding of what the pro's do to approach their business."
3,Interesting Perspectives from the Pro's,"This book won't teach you how to handicap thoroughbred races. However, if you are already an experienced handicapper, it will give you some interesting comments to digest, all from well known professionals.The six secrets aren't very secret anymore, but the views expressed are worth reading, and are particularly entertaining when the pro's disagree."
2,Not for vetrans of the game.,"These handicapping books are all pretty much the same. Tell you how to build the atom bomb, but you know you can never get the material to make it happen. Some fun stories and idea's but will not help you pick winners."
5,Sullivan does it again,"Steve Sullivan continues to churn out high impact, easily understandable inspirational books in the same style as his legendary ""Selling at Mach One"" and ""Leading at Mach Two."" His new book captures the story of Bill Yoast and brings out key lessons for life that most people can relate to and apply. Here's his action plan for life:1. Get prepared2. Embrace risk3. Dare to be different4. Stay nimble5. Play by the rules6. Confront injustice7. Be kindIn a time when everyone focuses on ""what's wrong"" in our society, Yoast and Sullivan allows us to see ""what's right"" and what can be different in our lives, so we can create the ripples in the pond and affect everyone we touch with our positive behavior.Care to follow two words of advice? ""Buy it."""
1,remember this titan:leson learned from a celebrated coach's journey: the bill yoast story,This book stinks - do not waste your time. I cannot think of one good thing to say about it.
5,Great Memories,This has always been a favorite album and I purchased a new one so I could keep one in the car and one in the house.
5,so happy to have found this!,"I had the original tape of this when it was released in '85....totally loved it, moved, it wore out, actually don't have a tape deck any more, so excited to have found it. Only weird thing, when it downloaded to my itune/ipod, the songs don't sync with the titles...but that's ok! The total best. Fidelity a lot better than I remembered, too!"
4,Still a classic,"Lots of memories here, Christmas in Dixie will always be a favorite. I wish it were snowing in the pines right now!"
5,Alabama Christmas,I purchased this album for the song of Angels amoung US. This has been a favorite of mine for a long time. The additional songs are great also.
3,Mediocre At Best,"To be honest, the only reason I ordered this was for the songs, ""Tonight Is Christmas"" and ""Christmas In Dixie"", both minor seasonal hits, back in the 80's. So far as I know, this CD is the only one that contains these songs, at least for a reasonable price.As for the rest of the material, it's tolerable, but that's about all I can say for it. Except for ""Thistlehair, The Christmas Bear"", that is, which is downright IDIOTIC, and should never have been recorded. :-/ :-(But, I guess I'm a bit of a purist. I'm not too much on ""new"" Christmas songs in the first place. I say, either do the classics or don't bother making a Christmas album."
5,Christmas Music to put you in the spirit,It is my first winter in the desert and I have had an impossible time getting into the holiday spirit (it's 80+ degrees!)! This cd reminds me of my Mom at home baking and decorating the tree. Put me right in the mood! I love this lively music that just forces one to sing along!
5,Alabama Christmas,"Country or not, you will love this effort by Alabama. Our Family's All-Time Favorite Holiday Album. It has been a hit with us since 1983 and is part of our family holiday traditions. Thistlehair The Christmas Bear gets more playtime than any other seasonal classic at our house. If you don't own a copy, you will wish you did. Three cassettes and four cd's later, we can't get enough of this masterpiece."
5,Alabama Christmas Music,"Love me some Alabama! I needed some Alabama Christmas music, had great songs I had not heard before. I am happy with the service from the supplier."
5,LOVE IT!!!,"BEST CHRISTMAS CD EVER! COULD LISTEN TO IT ALL YEAR, BRINGS BACK SO MANY MEMORIES OF MY CHILDHOOD. CHRISTMAS IN DIXIE IS THE BEST!"
3,does not do alabama justice,"i love the group, but i find that this album falls far short of my expectations. can not recommend this album"
2,Disapointed,This DVD should have been digitally remastered.Poor quality picture and sound.I hope someday The life and times of Grizzly Adams comes digitally remastered.
2,For the most part... Blech.,"I borrowed this from the library some time back, and was VERY unimpressed by the 'story' this all goes by (The 'kid who was picked on but is confident in the end.' type deal.) and it has a small bit of misinformation. The one redeeming factor of this video is that it does have some exceptional footage of bald eagles, which is only slightly inturrupted by the little kids' wowing over it."
5,1918 Paris Gun,"The book was very helpful to research I was doing about the 1918 Paris gun. It is the most authoritative and complete work I have found on the subject. The authors,G.V. Bull of McGill University and C.H. Murphy of US Army Ballistic Lab were uniquely qualified to write this book. German secrecy restrictions after WW 1 about the Paris gun made it difficult to reconstruct the design and performance of the gun. I found all of the information I needed to accurately replicate the calculation of the gun's range and flight profile of the fired shell. The book was sent from Aberdeen Bookstore. It was in perfect condition and had been packaged very expertly. I was very pleased with this purchase."
5,"yes, yes, yes","why hasn't an orchestra been able to do this before? with so many other Mahler 9ths out there, it is amazing that none are this calibar. i think all other recordings pale in comparison. the Royal Concertgebouw always plays well, but here they seem to step it up a notch. i have yet to hear another recording of this symphony with as much emotion as this one. buy this disc. and for some strange reason the SACD is cheaper than the regular CD."
4,3 secular cantatas from a little known Bach son,"JCF stands for Johann Christoph Friedrich (1732-1795) who was Concert-Meister at Buckeburg for most of his life. Apart from some trio sonatas Harmonia Mundi 901587, an organ fughetta on Erato17073, and a chorale ""Wachet auf"" on Conifer 51306 this is his only representation in the catalogue.The first cantata, Pygmalion, is sung by Harry van der Kamp (bass), the two latter by Barbara Schlick (soprano). ""Die Amerikanerin"" was so named by JCF in the year of the Declaration of Independance, but the subject matter concerns an Arabian girl, Saide. ""Ino"" is the same text made more famous in the setting by Telemann, but JCF gives it equally good treatment.Conductor Hermann Max. Recorded 1990. Playing time 73'21. German text and English translations."
1,false advertising on such cute earrings!,I bought these earring because I had a pair that I loved which were identical that I received as a gift. The problem was that my original pair were not sterling silver so they really irritated my ears. I then found these here on eve's addiction and ordered them because they were sterling silver but as I quickly found out they are not because they also really irritate my ears and I know for a fact sterling ones do not. If you are looking for quality earrings unfortunately these are not the right pair for you!! I wish I had not have spent the money.
1,It is time to mass produce another revision of a bad book!!,"The review/essay portion of this book is dry and extraneous. There are a fair amount of example questions, but they are not displayed in a reader friendly format. I quickly decided that I was better off with a couple old Calculus textbooks."
3,maybe the next cd will be better,"Jamie cd is good but I don't think it is worth the money it is going for. I would not compare Jamie to Luther or Prince like one of the reviewers has, Jamie can sing but not like Luther. I think the next cd will be better, I like the single that out now."
1,"C'mon, Man...1 Star For Ridiculous Price","Get real!! That cd will continue to sit there. I think Jamie can sing, but there is no way that I would pay such a price for something like this. And, there are no samples to hear, either? Don't insult my intelligence."
5,Looking for the album,"I love this album, Micky I am really interested and I do want the album so if your offer is still on the table please hit me up caliprincess101@hotmail.com...thanks"
1,prices rediculous,"I think that somebody is really trying to get over on poor people. Jamie's first album was good but come on 124.00 is outrageous! There are truely hard to albums out there that did better at the time of release than this one that don't even go for half as much as this one, this is crazy!"
5,Wonderful Book!!!,A terrific little book filled with wonderful recipes and the flavor of LaJolla. I love this book!
1,Hideous eyestrain and worst index on the planet!,"This book might be fine if the publisher had not chosen to print the ingredients in pale yellow (making them IMPOSSIBLE to read). That was undoubtedly to discourage photocopying, but defrauding the innocent customers who legally purchased the book should not have been an option. Also, it is almost impossible to find anything in the horrible index; it was a though they didn't want you to locate their recipes. In short, a mammoth disappointment."
4,What a great little book!,"I read this book in one sitting and really enjoyed it. It's a collection of immensely readable essays on Mary that anyone with an interest in religion will enjoy - regardless of your faith. An added bonus is the collection of icons and art that is used to illustrate this great little book.This protestant came away from my hour of reading this book with a much greater love of the Mother of Jesus, and recommend it to anyone who wants to grow in their faith."
2,"Not what I had hoped, but it sort of answered my question.","I bought this book, thinking from the description it could give some sort of Biblical foundation for offering Prayers to Mary. The author, who is supposedly a master Theologian, doesn't do that. Instead, he merely reiterates Orthodox Church teaching on the subject. For instance, he says the 12 Apostles were transported from various parts of the world to be present at Mary's death...simply because the Orthodox Churches teaches this, and therefore you have to believe it. There's really no argument for the worship of Mary, other than the Orthodox church says to do it. I was unconvinced.But in a way, it did answer my question: Is there a Biblical foundation for praying to Mary. The answer is no. So for that, I gave it 2 stars."
4,The live story of a band,This is John Mayall bluesbreakers on the road in the sexties............and it is history now !......but in somewayit is also a great live album you most have if you are a John Mayall fan. It is not the greatest album at all......just a good time with the great master of blues........................This is John Mayall bluesbreakers live!!!!!
2,Not too thrilled about it,"I found the rocks are really hard to break (I hammered one on concrete for a while before it cracked). Not much ""glitter "" inside. It was OK, but my 4 YO was not really interested in it, because the inside was not really all that pretty. I think its a fun one-time experiment, but we were not really that thrilled with it.Not the rocks fault - no one can tell what's inside really. :) Maybe we just got unlucky with our batch."
2,Disappointing,"Got this for my kids for the holidays and we recently decided to break them open. The kids had a blast with that part! They were also very curious about how the geodes formed which led to one of those ""teachable moments."" But only one had any significant crystals in it which led to some tears on the part of my younger son who didn't get any in his share of the stash. Overall, I wouldn't buy this again."
2,"More ""Rock"" Than Geode","We bought these (despite other negative reviews) for our children's science share project on different types of rocks. The idea for the geodes was to crack one for the spectators (kids and their parents) every 15 minutes. When it was time for the first one, we just couldn't crack it, so my husband went outside in order to bang it harder. He went through at least 6 in order to get a couple to crack, but they were all solid (some little crystals but not much). We weren't able to have the ""wow"" factor of cracking open a geode and seeing the cool hollow inside with any of the geodes in this kit. It was very disappointing for my kids, and also for the kids coming around to hopefully see a geode opening in person. Thankfully we had lots of other specimens available from our own collection."
2,OK but not great,my son gane me the money to order this for him. We both were really disiponted. He got onyl one to break. not worth the money.
4,great,"this product is great however your going to get a mix, if kids have big expectations dont buy this one. there is a good amount, you need to help kids break these. but overall happy with experience, great price."
4,Interesting,"These are interesting... I'm not sure what I expected when I bought these for my kid but I was surprised at how simple it was. Basically take it out of the box and smash them with a hammer. Hah, it's a little weird. My kid liked it so I gave it four stars."
2,Kinda a bum deal,Not too exciting! Expected for sparkles. You get what you pay for on this one! Some kids might find it neat but 3 years later I have this in a drawer with most of the rocks left.
5,Starter set,This is a perfect starter set for my 9 year old grandson. His 14 year old sister is very much into geology and has passed her love to him.
3,neat,"These were knda cool. I knew they wouldn't be the colored geodes.. you only get the white crystals i some of these, not all."
1,Disappointing,"Purchased five of these sets thinking they would be fun stocking stuffers. Wanting to check out what I purchased, I opened one of the five. The geodes are tiny (not as pictured). It was like breaking open dirt-clods... that have a small empty space inside... but not crystals. Maybe it was a ""dud"" box, but will probably be returning the other four."
2,Geodes or rocks?,The ten geodes were about the size of cocktail meatballs and three of them simply crumbled into sandy gravel. My grandkids did have fun trying to smash the rocks with a hammer and a couple geodes had a tiny amount of quartz or some sparkly mineral inside. I certainly would not spend [...] on them again.
1,Disappointment,"Our 9-year-old is quite the amateur geologist. He is totally immersed in all things ""rocks and minerals."". We have bought him several geode-breaking kits over the past year and this was by far the worst. Compared to others, the geodes were small, difficult to crack open (even for an adult) and mostly cracked into pieces, rather than in half. You get what you pay for: these were less expensive than others and definitely ""cheap."" Not worth disappointing a chld for a couple of dollars. Look elsewhere."
5,Screams of delight,"and demands for an immediate loan of a hammer and sock greeted the unwrapping of this gift. He LOVES it, and is limiting himself to 1 smash a day to make it last longer."
5,A Blast!,"I bought this at a local educational store for my kids after we had gone to a Gem and Mineral show where they were able to have geodes cracked. This is a fabulous product! Ok, so the rocks are tiny. What do you expect for $[...]? In any case, we had a great time with the rocks, a couple of hammers, and some old socks. Well worth the price for some quality time mith my kids. Definately will purchase more. Most likely a box for each of my kids and then some for my niece and nephew."
2,Meh,"I got this for my Geologist father for Christmas. The geodes included weren't very large, and the crystals in the geodes weren't very spectacular.For a little kid I guess it would be ok, but this wasn't anything special for us."
1,Disappointment,"This was a huge disappointment to my kids - 8, 10, 12. There were no crystals inside any of them! They were extremely hard to break, but we decided that geodes that scientists discover probably are also hard to break. Once we got them open, they were sorely disappointed - not a one had any crystals. The only good point I have for this product is that I taught the kids that scientists don't always find ""cool"" stuff as they are on their digs...."
1,Disappointing. Nothing inside!,Kids were excited and we broke them open and it was just a rock. Solid. Nothing inside.Avoid buying this.
3,missing geodes,this kit was ok except that there was no way even my 13 year old was going to break one...it took an adult with a hammer...and that it was short by 4!!!That is allot when you do not include many...out of the ones we had one was a good geode...go elsewhere!
3,Fun but not as easy as implied.,"My son is 11 and he liked the idea of having to ""break"" it, but it was not as easy as the instructions implied. The instructions say to put it in a sock and hit it with a hammer....but that is more difficult that it sounds. My son ended up putting it in the sock and smashing it into the ground to break it open. It's a good item if your child is really interested in learning about the crystal part of it. I would recommend it but definitely find a more creative way to break it open. Unless you want a bunch of smashed fingers."
3,Pebbles,"We haven't broke open any of the geodes yet, because this is a Christmas gift, but I will say I was slightly disappointed when I looked inside and noticed that 4 of the 10 geodes were extremely tiny - around an inch in diameter. I understand they may still be geodes, but I wasn't expecting a large quantity to be so small. I am not sure how we are going to break them without smashing them to a bunch of tiny pieces."
2,Hard to Crack/dull interior,"These geodes were very hard to crack open. It took several good whacks with a hammer to crack them and then they tended to fly into lots of tiny pieces. They were interesting to look at once open, but not very colorful. Mostly just darker shades of grey. I'm not an expert in any form of geodes, but these were not at all what I expected."
3,Just okay.,"My 6 year old daughter thought this was a fun activity, hence the 3 stars; I was much less impressed. She is really into rocks and crystals so I was very excited to come across these. When it arrived, I was surprised at how small the package was and even more surprised at how tiny the rocks were!! In the picture the box looks full...my rocks filled only about 1/3 of the box. She did have fun whacking away at the rocks and she was at it for about a half an hour or so. Only one of ours was full of clear crystals and that made her happy, but the rest were duds and I could see she was disappointed. In the end, we had a holey sock to throw away and little tiny shards of rock all over I had to vacuum up."
5,great fun,"i love these geodes! they are a great addition to my rock collection. they open fairly easy but the crystals do break off and some dont have many crystals but all of them do. if you are interested in smashing things or crystals and better yet both, i highly reccomend buying these. and my mom also loves these too so dont think that this is a kid only thing."
1,What a rip off....,"This review is from my child:Today I got a holiday gift from my science teacher, one of these gifts was this geode from ""Geode Central"". Me and my dad first, put the geode in a sock and started to hammer it... probably took 10 minuets..... Well 10 minuets wasted... but in the geode like other reviews was junk ore (granite... Umm maybe concrete). So don't waste your hard earned money on this.( I hope my friends at school got a successful geode, well unlike me...). I still kept the rock it looks like pillow lava..."
1,bad purchase,"This purchase was a BIG disappointment. The 5-year-old and 7-year old I bought the geodes for were hugely disappointed. Not one of these tiny rocks had a crystal inside. Not even a fragment. I used to purchase geodes for my daughter when she was little, and most had crystals. These were duds! Buyer beware!"
2,Not what it's cracked up to be!,"My 9-year old, science-minded, daughter received this kit for Christmas. She collects rocks and was looking forward to both the breaking/discovery aspect and having more rocks for her collection. We wrapped the very small (walnut sized is an apt discription) geode in a sock and smacked it with a hammer and then dumped out the pieces. The rock had pretty much shattered into very small fragments, none of which were particulary crystalline or interesting. We went through a few more (destroying the sock in the process) before my daughter completely lost interest. All rock fragments were tossed- none deemed good enough for the collection. Possibly the geodes would have been more interesting if they'd been cut by a rock saw (like the ones we got at the state fair)."
2,high hopes that fell fast,"My daughter got this as a gift for her 9th birthday and was very excited to start cracking. (she has been asking for something of this nature for over a year now)Disappointed is putting it mildly. The geodes are very small and once cracked open, most did not contain any crystal structures. Now I am not a Geologist so I can't use proper termanology for what we found, although there were small crystals in some most were very insignifacnt. All I can say is she was let down.Not worth the money, shop around or go somewhere that they actually cut geodes open for you. Yes I know it cost alot more, but we could have had a better discovery if had cracked open a few of the rocks that we find in our garden daily."
1,Just Rocks,"Kids were very disappointed! Out of ""Two Boxes"", four rocks were partially hollow with a few crystals. The rest were solid round ""Little"" rocks!"
5,A Classic,"Though I'm not always enamored with Woolf's writing style, I do always find inspiration in this book. Her dedication to art, feminism and independence was before its time, and still seems somewhat progressive. I recommend this book to women, artists and anyone who can appreciate the power of independence."
4,Interesting perspective on female authors.,"I had to read this book for my Women in Literature and Visual Arts class, as it focused on female authors in the past, and why they had little representation in history. The overall thesis of the book is that women need a room of their own in order to finds a place in history. It served as the foundation of our class. This book is certainly not for everyone, but it was an interesting perspective and certainly worth reading."
4,Great for female writers and those who love/live with them,"Familiar with Virginia Woolf only from reputation, I picked up a copy of this book at an antique store. It sat on my nightstand for over a year before I opened the very short essay. Written almost 100 years ago, I related so well to her words, it's one of the few books I know I'll read again, and again. I've actually underlined sections - something I never do! Great for female writers and those who love them."
3,College Reading,I learned what I needed to from this book;but it reminded me of the types of books Ihad to read in college. I was glad I purchasedit though.
4,a room for what?,"This essay reunites several works from Virginia Woolf about the right of women to possess a place - a room- to read, write and work, intended that not as domestic work as was usual for women during many times.This book is very good. The problem with it today is many people uses this work only as a vindicating feminist weapon, while few people has truly read it, but remember, Virginia Woolf wanted that room not for itself, but for a finality: to do an intellectual task inside. Some people forgets this fundamental fact."
5,Bow Down,"Virginia Woolf always blows my mind with her ability to marry illustrative, vivid paintings and academic writing. I often find that she makes a clear conclusion that I have previously arrived at independently, but could have never materialized or verbalized successfully. I will always have a room of my own!"
1,Room better left unvisited,"Although this critique might be viewed by my professors as academic suicide, I shall plunge headfirst and hope that the branches of tolerance break my fall. I do not like A Room of Ones Own. I understand the concept of stylized writing, but the content of the book does nothing to draw in the reader. Certainly, Woolf's mastery in writing should be applauded on its merit; however, I am not progressed far enough in my education to fully appreciate Woolf's subtleties. There is nothing in A Room of One's Own that remains once the book is closed, although the pages are full of wonderful ideas. The presentation of these ideas; however, are uninteresting and handled in a very preachy manner. It is my opinion that such revolutionary ideas should have been shot forth from a canon rather than whispered in a library"
2,this book bit,"Virginia Woolf is in no way an encouragement to young women writers. This book is a downer, filled with many inaccurate conclusions and information, including many twisted facts concerning Charlotte Bronte and views."
1,Feminist propoganda,"After being forced to read this book for English class, I feel it my obligation to let people know just how bad it is. Woolf is an ardent feminist, and will go to whateer length necessary to tell her audience of the supposed atrocities committed upon society by men. According to her, men are pigs who simply suppress women to elevate themselves. Her constant self-contradiction (is she not doing here the same thing that she accuses men of?) makes her thesis difficult to believe. Her unusual style, using dashes instead of proper names, only distracts the reader. All in all, I do not recommend this book to anyone who is capable of conscious thought."
5,Very nice,This is a very nice slip. My daughter's 3 yrs old and I bought her a size 4 to 6 because someone else said to buy a size bigger in their review. I'm happy I listened to her because it does seem to run a bit small. I also suggest going up to the higher size.
5,Best slip ever!,Bought this some time back for our little girl. Bought a bigger size than needed and I would recommend that. It really adds that nice touch to her sunday dresses and even just her no longer sunday dresses but now everyday dresses.
5,Excellent Quality,"Very impressed with the sound quality and performance. If this album does not make you smile and rock, you must be in a coma."
5,George Winston's greatest contribution to music,"George Winston, the producer of this CD, was a top seller on Windham Hill records during the 1980s and early '90s. In case you've forgotten Winston (and he was eminently forgettable), he played soft, innocuous cocktail music on the piano which he was pleased to call ""jazz,"" but for some reason unknown to Mankind, one of his idols was Fess Byrd, a.k.a. Professor Longhair, whose style was about as related to George Winston's as Charles Mingus' is to Kenny G.This was my intoduction to Professor Longhair, and what an introduction it is. The man played the piano as if it were a tuned conga drum; when jazz legend Art Tatum heard him play in the early 1950s, he was mesmerized by his style. No, Fess was no Tatum, not even close, but WOW what a great, asymmetric piano style he had!! Highly recommended."
2,most forms not customizable,"I got this to upgrade the earlier edition I had bought during grad school. Now I am starting my private practice and wanted updated versions of the forms. I now find out most of the forms (some of the most important ones) in this new edition cannot be customized, they only give PDF versions in the CD, so they are basically unusable! I cannot insert my own header as the form recommends I do and at the bottom it says it is taken from Paper Office. This is infuriating. I feel cheated. I am sure the info in the book is good, but why would they do this with the forms? This seems to me like a step back from previous edition I had and it is a misrepresentation of what the book has to offer. SO beware not all the forms are customizable therefore useless, unless you want to copy the content onto word and reformat it."
4,"Intriguing, but not crude","Although ""Perfect Victim"" deals with very crude and disgusting elements, it does not go into so much detail that one gets ill reading it. The book is well-written and tells the unbelievable but true story of a girl who is kidnapped and held captive as a slave for seven years. As the district attorney who tried the case, co-author McGuire fills the book with details and legal explanations. The book covers the seven year time span with a few gaps in the story, but still gives enough information for the reader to know what is going on. Although it is not difficult to determine the outcome of the story, this is still a great suspenseful read. I especially liked the photo inserts because seeing the box that held Stan captive and getting to put faces with the names makes the story even more realistic than just reading about it."
2,Could have been better,"This book was sadly disappointing. I was expecting this elaborate book. What I read was a giant mess. The author skipped back and forth from when she was kidnapped to the court case. It made for a big huge puzzle of confusion and was not as good as it could have potentially been! I actually went through and read all the parts of her being kidnapped and what she went through and then went back and read the court case at the end. Then it seemed to make more sense to me but I still feel like I want my money back so I can buy a good true crime book, by a good author like Ann Rule....then I know I won't be disappointed!"
4,"Shockingly graphic and upsetting, but a gripping book","This was a hard book to book down. It was so interesting to read the court transcripts and to really see how the defendant attempted to justify his horrific behaviour.Colleen Stan has been through so much, and the book shows her strength as a survivor of kidnapping, multiple rapes, sadistic torture, sensory deprivation, semi-starvation, complete isolation and the mind control and manipulation that these conditions made her more vulnerable to. It is amazing that she broke free at all, and that she found the strength to confront him in trial."
5,I Met Them,"OMG, I had read this book twice when it came out, it was so good. Then in 1990 I was visiting a friend in Moreno Valley Ca when a small girl about 5 came over. My friend said her name was Danielle and her mother was the girl kept in a box under a bed named Colleen. She had a terrible life and often asked if she could spend the night. We took her to a parade and I still have pics. They moved a short time later. Last we heard, no one knew where Colleen was and Danielle was in prison in No California."
3,harrowing,"Very good story, however it is horrific and very disturbing in some parts, it tended to play on my mind a lot as its a harrowing read of suffering and torture, I did find myself taking breaks from reading it as I found it very upsetting, having said that- I just had to finish it to see how it all turned out !"
3,Disturbing,"Stay on the author's good side. Otherwise all of your good qualities will be disregarded and everything else will be revealed.It amazes me that some psycho could treat someone the way the defendant did, let her go jogging and get a job, and still keep her under his control so she'd return. I would have thought she'd take ANY chance to try to escape.If this wasn't a true story I'd never have thought it was believeable."
5,perfectly disgusting,"i read this book when i was taking classes at Cabrillo College, in Santa Cruz , CA. i dint read it because required but because i didnt think it was possible for some thing so bizzar to actually happen. well i was wrong . and it totoally made me sick to think about how a person could get so brain washed for it to continue. Ms. McGuire and Ms.Norton wrote this book with all the objectivity and compassion possible, though, i believe that i would have been hard for me not to kill the guy outright ....but thats just me.i think this book is a way to show that the human spirt goes on even after a horrible incident such as this. Kudos to the writers and the woman who had the guts to perservere!"
4,VICTIM LIVES WILLINGLY IN BOX,"This is the most amazing True Crime book I have ever read. The main character actually kidnaps a young woman with his young wife and baby in the car. The victim, Colleen, is immediately put into a box, and lives there 24 hours a day for months. She is kept as a sex and torture slave. After she is totally brainwashed, she continues to stay with this deranged couple and is free to work and walk around the neighborhood.One would wonder how this could be possible, and yet from the months and months of constant deprivation, you come to depend on your captor for simple survival. This book was shocking beyond belief and a very good read. Thank you"
2,I'd rather hear the story from the person who experienced it...,"I saw this book was mentioned Buried Memories - Katie Beers' Story and decided to search for it to download. Instead I came across one written by Jim B Green that tells Colleen's story, not the prosecutors. Y'all should read it.Colleen Stan: The Simple Gifts of Life: Dubbed by the Media ""The Girl in the Box"" and ""The Sex Slave"""
3,Average,"This was a very interesting book, but pretty standard fair for this class of book. The one thing I kept asking myself was why didn't she leave, the explanation of this issue in the book did not convince me. Overall a well written book that is easy to fly through."
2,A mediocre effort...,"Tbe book is an easy read and a good passing of time. In relation to the content of the book, at times it tends to drag and is boring. Frankly dont buy the story of a wife can tolerate bringing another woman and being shocked when she finds that husband has been sleeping with the victim. THe syndrome of victims falling in love with captors is known, but this was no child.. She was an eighteen year old woman. Seeing that all is well now, but this is not a particular book that I will recommend as its pure speculation. A person who was left out of the house and did not escape but once told by wife all the stories of the ""company"" was fake springing to action, this seems like its all dramatics..."
3,to much legal information,i felt that for a case that was so unbelivable there was just a lot of missing gaps as to how a person could be manpulated into not running away at there first chance of freedom no mater what might happen to her even death would be better than to endure 7 years of continuous torture and abuse but i guess mabey if we were told more about her past mabey we could get a idea what kind of mental state she was in when she was kidnapped. also there was just to much legal information to keep the full attention of the average person but lets not forget this book was written by a attorney what do you expect its a slow read book so if you loose interest very fast this is not the book for you.
1,yuck,"Okay, normally, i like bondage. i like anything of the sort. but this is just plain sick. i only read the excerpt, but its cruel and disgusting and unnatural..."
2,Early Godspeed exploitations,"2 1/2While a certain western darkness infuses this mildly appealing post-rock with some sort of distinction, besides for few climactic payoffs little sets the songwriting apart from any soft/loud standardizations."
5,most unique journal,Academic Exchange Quarterly is most unique academicjournal I have ever seen.http://rapidintellect.com/AEQweb/I am not aware of any other academic journal having somany refereed articles in one issue.
5,Works Well with LED Lamps,"I replaced CFLs with LED bulbs in a couple of table lamps. The LEDs that I bought are dim-able, which led me to this item. This could not be easier to install. Cut the lamp cord, push the ends into this dimmer, press the buttons that secure the cord inside the dimmer. A pair of scissors is all the tools you need. The lamps can now be adjusted to whatever brilliance I want. Really worth the price."
4,LAMP DIMMER,I HAVE A HIGH INTENSITY LAMP THAT THE SLIDE DIMMER SWITCH GAVE UP 3 YEARS AGO.I FINALLY DECIDED TO REPAIR IT WITH THE LUTRON SLIDE DIMMER SWITCH.IT WAS EASY TO ASSEMBLE TO THE LIGHT CORD. IT TURNS ON THE LAMP AND EASILY ADJUSTS THE LAMP TO THE DESIRED BRIGHTNESS.ALSO YOU CANT BEAT THE PRICE !
4,instructions,"You will need a magnifying glass to read the instructions. Or, get them full size fromLutron TechnicalDocumentLibrary/030628The neutral on a polarized plug has one or more ribs along the cord and should be connected to the whitish or silver screw on the socket.It is very important to get the polarity correct so that the shell of the socket will be connected to the neutral.If your lamp socket has a switch, consider replacing it with one that does not. People get confused if there are multiple switches in series."
1,Not the product that is advertised,"The product is advertised as having a nightlight. This is not the case. There is no nightlight on this dimmer switch. When the first dimmer arrived and we hooked it up and, when we discovered that there was no light, we called Amazon customer service for assistance getting the product, with a nightlight, that we ordered. We explained that, according to the manufacturer, the product number does NOT have a light. Customer service insisted that the dimmer had a light and that they would send another. Imagine our lack of surprise when the new dimmer arrived without a nightlight. It's been at least a month since we informed Amazon customer service of the problem. At the very least, you would have thought that they would have removed the words ""with nightlight"" from the product description. DO NOT PURCHASE THIS ITEM IF YOU NEED THE NIGHLIGHT. The product DOES NOT have a one."
1,Just so you know...,..this is the kind of dimmer where you have to cut the cord on the lamp and reattach it. We're too scared so we haven't used it yet. D'oh.
5,review of lamp cord dimmer,Very happy with this item. works great. quick shipping. would recommend it for dimming capabilities without a 3 way bulb.
5,Great as extension cord - Energy save/ soft lighting,"Just ordered the Plug in model below:Lutron TT-300H-WH Electronics Plug-In Lamp Dimmer, Whiteas seen on the Nate Burkus [ABC Network] show. Have installed all CFL bulbs and this is for a Large Table lamp.based on all reviews went the above as years ago when remodeling older homes w/3 kids that:""Plumbing leaks and Electrical HURTS!"" no matter how simple it seems to be."
4,Obsolete Man,"I ordered the Twilight Zone VHS tape for a friend because he mentioned he really liked the episode ""Obsolete Man"". At first the tape got eaten by the VCR. He tried a different tape, it worked perfectly. After several attempts to watch the tape, and he was able to retrieve it, my friend ran a head cleaner in the machine and it did better. He also stopped trying to go past the point where it kept being eaten, as he was only interested in the ""Obsolete Man"" episode. So we really are not sure if it was the fault of the machine or the tape.There were no outward signs that the tape should be defective. For less than $5,including shipping, I feel as though we got our money's worth. Over-all we were very satisfied."
5,Correct Letter Writing,"This book arrived in a shorter time than was specified, which I was thrilled about. It was in good condition and I would order from the sender again."
4,Good product to begin with,"This item does exactly what it says it will do, which is good and bad. It is a good product to begin with but I can see, after the first usage, that the meters with a needle and scale will give more accurate readings. This particular procduct just lets you know if you are cold-warm-hot. If you are going to buy an EMF meter, spend a little extra and get the type with a scale instead."
2,Accuracy of readings (?),I did receive the elf gaussmeter very quickly but I question the accuracy of the readings--when I move it away from the laptop it blinks red in the danger zone and I doubt it's sensing spectral emanations...I guess I shouldn't expect precision readings for the price but I don't find this product is especially useful and will probably return it or give it away.
3,E L F gaussmeter,Item was cheap in price and did what I needed for the kids ghost hunt. It did work! Range is not that far but made it even scarrier for them.
4,Pleased Ghost Hunter,"This is a great started E.M.F. meter for the amature ghost hunter, if you are looking for a starter eter this is the meter for you. Its inexpensive and the three lights are easy to see in the dark."
5,ghost hunting,I purchase the Gaussmeter for my wife. She and a group of her friends have started a ghost hunting organization some years ago. I was just one more piece of equipment that was added to their arsenal of gadgets. She said it works very well. The price was outstanding and it works flawlessly.
3,Works as advertised,Bought this to make my home safer from ELF and it works as advertised. Not the highest quality but it works.
1,Worthless to us.,"I bought this to see if I could detect EMFenvironmental stress. Wasn't helpful. However itwas also cheap. So it's a gamble, and most who likeit are only using it for entertainment purposes."
4,Not sure yet,"I was excited to receive this. I slapped a battery in and turned it on. I was surprised to see that there isn't as much pollution in my small apt. as I thought there would be. Also, was kind of disappointed to see no emf levels from my cell phone, computer, computer monitor, and lamp. I thought cell phone, and definitely the computer would be dirty. I thought my old television would put out a huge emf field, but the meter read safe only 18"" away. I did find that my whole bathroom was 'danger'. There is an electrical room on the other side of it, so that makes sense. I am sure the meter is working properly; I tested it by holding close to oven and stove-top burners, then turning them on. The meter lit up to danger right away. I am thinking about getting a Trifield, but am not sure if it would yield better results, probably just more refined. In the end I think it was definitely worth 13 bucks."
4,EXELENT!!!,This book is very helpful to a young falconer such as myself. I figured out which birds to catch and which to not. Very Helpful!!!
5,Great Binoculars for Sports,"It took almost a month to receive, due to being on back-order, but it was well worth the wait! I was replacing an old pair of extra-wide sports angle Bushnell's I had used for 25 years. I was leery of the perma focus, but I wanted the extra wide angle. Well I tried them at a few NASCAR races and they worked perfectly. Three people in my party all used the binoculars and the focus was perfect for all three. Plus I wear mono focal contact lenses, (the lenses for each eye are a different strength), so I was a little worried what I would see. The view was prefect and in focus for both eyes. Plus I had lost a lens in one eye, at one race, and I still had perfect focus!! a Great price and a perfect view!!"
5,Perma Focus Binoculars,"These are great binoculars. Would never buy anything but perma focus again. We liked them so well, we just ordered two more pair. Nice size, perfect for bird watching. We also do a LOT of traveling and these are simply perfect in every way. I have used compared the view from these versus binoculars costing many times more. They are just as good in my opinion. Can't go wrong with these."
5,Great buy,I bought this as a Christmas present for my daughter's family. They live next to a wooded area and pond and have been thrilled to see the deer and ducks up close without needing to focus! It's great! They will also use it to watch the kids in their sports. Definitely happy that I purchased it and a good value.
4,Really works,"Very pleased. I am baffled as to how permafocus works, but it does. I have reasonably good eyes and only wear glasses for reading. If you wear glasses full time these might not be for you, so try it first."
5,Great Gift,I bought this as a Christmas gift for my husband. It's true-to-size. It's a unique design that we hadn't seen in stores. It's a quality product. He's worn it and I've washed it repeatedly with no problems.
1,Unfit as a college textbook,"This book contains articles of opinion on the subject of te environment, but very little concrete information. What references are offered in the various articles are pieces of select information that only tells half of the story. Most of the articles have an obvious left-leaning political slant (a few are absolute extremists), and most express opinions as though they are facts. Although the articles are well written for the most part, this book should not be used as a college textbook since it only presents one side of the environmental issue- basically, humans are bad for the environment.If you want facts, don't bother with this one."
3,Difficult to read,I read this author a bit at a time. You need to have a very good knowledge of everyday life in Hawthornes' time to fully understand what he describes.
3,Just Not a Huge Fan,"Don't get me wrong; Hawthorne's stories are incredible. The plots are fascinating, and the writing style is fantastic. However, the characters are little more than devices to drive the plot forward, and that's not at all what I look for in stories."
2,Good music is timless,I was disapointed when I discovered that this was not footage from original performances. As I continued to watch I was really enjoying listening to the music it brought back many memories and the performances were well done. If you like Motown this is worth viewing.
1,False Advertising,"Even though it's described as ""The Early Years"", these are all recent performances. A rip off."
3,Sad State of Affairs,This DVD shows a pretty sad state of affairs. The performers look (and sound) terrible and are way past their prime trying to party like its 1969 (Martha Reeves trying to squeeze in a 60s style dress is particularly pathetic). Imagine a senior citizens home giving a performance at the Apollo Theater and you get the idea.
3,"Okay, not great","For those complaining that calling this ""The Early Years"" is misleading, reading the packaging or product descriptions should have clued you in that these are performances from the current acts. You should have been clued in when the bands have names like ""Joe Billingslea's Contours"" and ""The Temptations Review featuring Dennis Edwards.""The performances are decent for what they are...I was kind of confused by the audio on Martha Reeves' performances, which sounded very much like pre-recorded tracks as opposed to the other performers, who sound live. The Temptations Review actually sounds better than the current Temptations, and The Four Tops, even with a younger lead singer, still sound great.If you can get this for less than $10, definitely pick it up. If not, only buy if you're a HUGE fan of all the songs."
4,"Not as scary, still good and creepy","This miniseries movie scared the crap out of me when I was a kid...long before I ever read the book. King's novel is exponentially more terrifying, but the miniseries is a relatively faithful adaptation (come on, there's just some things they can't show you on TV). I didn't find this series as horrifying as I once did, but you really have to give Tim Curry credit for creating a truly eerie and sinister version of Pennywise. He'll probably haunt my nightmares forever."
4,IT,"The movie IT, can make you want to cringe, especially if you have one of those Clown Phobias. Oh, Pennywise is cute, at first, then shows his terrifing side. He plays on peoples fears, fears from childhood, that some may not quite get over. Great movie, was originally a mini-series on TV, great to watch sraight through, without all those pesty commercial breaks. Mr. King, at his best."
4,Kiss your old fears away and have some new ones--a clown!,"I first saw ""IT"" when I was nine years old. My best friend was having a sleep over with four girls sleeping over and the other five were going to walk home around eight o'clock. When I showed up with ""IT"" they stayed until nine o'clock and were too scared to walk back to their houses in the dark. As for me, I was afraid too, but when I turned twelve I saw the book and immediately bought ""IT"", read ""IT"", loved the book. I agree with many people that saw ""IT"" and have also read the book; the movie is BAD compared to the book, though the movie is good in a way because some parts of the book are hard to follow and the movie is easy to go with (with the exception of the cheesy spider at the end). One of my friends adores clowns and I can't sleep over at her house anymore because you can see dozens of clown faces in the darkness, dozens of glaring smiles and fluffy hair of red or orange... I CAN'T stay over there after reading and watching ""IT""!"
4,IT: A Mind-Blower,"The problem with taking Stephen King out of the pages and translating him to the screen is that so much detail is often lost, costing the viewer the feel that was drawn from the actual novel. That all changes with ""It""! Amazingly enough, a TV mini-series captured the best two facets of the novel: the evil of Pennywise the Clown (won't give away too much here), and the ability of a group of children, who dub themselves ""The Loser's Club"", to bond together in friendship with the common purpose of ending a killing machine that's been feasting upon their little Maine town for ages & ages.The best part of this movie was Tim Curry, hands down. He played Pennywise in a campy fashion, but when Pennywise needed to be evil and ghastly....oh, brother, was Curry right on the money. Puts shivers down your spine. This is one that my children avoid at all costs because the nightmares aren't worth it to them.... but YOU'LL love it! Excellent horror story......well presented."
4,they all float down,"my favorite Stephen King book brought to movie besides Dreamcatcher. Tim Curry, who better to play Pennywise the clown then him. he's so awesome in this role. not much of a horror movie then you'd expect, plus its a TV movie. but people who are afraid of clowns beware, Pennywise will scare the pants off you, or not. great cast includes John Ritter(may he rest in peace) as Ben Hanscomb, Annette O'Toole as Beverly Marsh, Tim Reid as Michael Hanlon, Richard Thomas as Billy Boy, Harry Anderson as Richie Tozier, Richard Mauser as Stan, Jonathan Brandis as Young Bill and a everso recognizable Seth Green as Young Richie Tozier. I wanna live in Derry, well where they shot the film anyway. I'd love to live at that place. theres some dry acting in this as well and some stupidparts too, just dont let that ruin the movie for you"
1,i am so disappointed,i am so disappointed by this movie. this is nothing like the book. the casting was done horribly. i think the only people who were even cast correctly as thier discription in the book was Richie (played by seth green) and bill (the kid from the never ending story). everybody else didn't even look the the way they should. like stanely uris' mom. she shouldn't been fat in the movie she was an skinny old lady. damn't kids can't we just do what the book says...
1,Shudder in a Bad Way,"The movie IT is one of the very worst movie adaptions that i have ever seen, doing no justice at all to the absolute grandeur of the book. IT is one of the greatest books that i have ever read; scary, thought provoking, profound, gripping, and fun, it ranks in the top five in my list of greatest books of all time. The movie, on the other hand, attempts to fit a book with over 1000 pages into three hours and fails miserably. It has it all: bad acting, (except for Tim Curry of course), loss of plot, theme, and philosophy, and horrible new ending that has nothing to do with the book. Here's a tip, screw the movie, read the book.Summarized reaction:Wow, Tim Curry is a really good actor and plays his part really well! Too bad everything else sucks."
1,it's hard to fathom how bad this movie really is......,"This movie is so far off from the book its not even funny!! Pennywise's suit is wrong, they added stuff in, took stuff out, put the events in the wrong order and in the wrong settings, etc. The acting is horrible (except for tim curry) so all in all, its just BAD! B-A-D! I absolutely loved the book and was looking forward to seeing this movie, and I was pretty [darned] dissapointed! Stay away from this movie at all costs and just read the book."
1,Holy Exposition Stephen King!,"ow ow ow ow ow!!This one really hurt me. Just read the book and made the mistake of watching this movie. Way too expository and all the actors give career worst performances. Hated how a cool novel became The Big Chill of horror movies. I mean I could have done without the bike scene, the Chinese dinner montage, the huggy moments. I mean it was really off in tone from the novel. And then there was the exposition. It was some of the clunkiest I've ever seen. And that ending? Oh goodness! Here's how you defeat ""The Eater of Worlds"", you stomp a mudhole in its deadlights. Stupid, stupid, stupid. Why they didn't get the turtle who puked out the Universe in it is beyond me. Why the heck not at that point? Couldn't have been made worse."
3,"Steven King's ""It""","Steven King's 'It"" was a Ok video, a pale comparison to the book. The casting, even though it was a TV movie from the 80's, was suspect. But the good news is, I hear producers are looking to remake 'It"" for the cinema, with a proper budget and a top director. Too often King's books never get a proper budget when that make the transition from book to film. Over all if you wnat to remember your childhood from the 80's its a good 10.00 dolare spent."
2,Incredibly boring!!,"Maybe it's just me and the fact that I love movies like ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" ""Saw"" ""Jason"" etc. But I gave this movie probably five chances, TV version and regular DVD, and I could no get into it. I mean, yeah killer clowns are typically scary as hell, but not this one, Puppet Master scared me more than this did. I actually fell asleep a few times through this. I could only watch maybe an hour before turning off it was so boring. The only reason for two stars instead of one was because the storyline was not bad and it's from Stephen King, the master of horror. I give anything and everything from King a chance, but this and some ""night shift industrial"" based movie are just beyond boring."
3,Read the Novel instead or wait for a remake,"Recent remakes of old Stephen King movies (i.e. Carrie, Salem's Lot, The Shinning) have been relatively well done and entertaining, but if any others should be made ... IT should defineately be at the top of the list. I saw this movie back in the early 90s and thought it was good. I have since read the novel and recently rewatched IT again, and found a lot of the scenes to be incredibly cheesy and poorly made. There was an incredible amount of important material in the novel which was missing in the film and the changes that were made between the novel and the movie were NOT for the better. Yes, I give lots of props to Tim Curry and a few of the performances by the kid actors stood out, but overall, looking back, this movie could of been so much better."
3,One of the better Stephen King movies,"Just like Pet Sematary this movie is well made but too long and gets a little boring here and there. A group of kids have trouble with a supernatural force that's a clown and then grow up with the supernatural spirit that follows them. The second half is a bunch of grown-ups having flashbacks and the firsthalf is a kids point of view. Not really the best nor worst Stephen King adaption to movie but could have worked better if it weren't so long. A good cast features John Ritter,Annette O'Toole,Tim Reid,Harry Anderson,Richard Masur,Dennis Christopher,and Richard Thomas as well as Tim Curry as the It clown named Pennywise. The best parts are when the clown pops up in the shower and scares the kid and when the girl sees a balloon in her sink and pops releasing blood. Watch to watch on TV(sci/fi channel and USA) show it all the time but do not buy unless you have a Stephen King book and movie collection."
2,The Scariest Thing in the Movie...,"..is Richard Thomas's ponytail. Honestly, this is a pretty sorry adaptation of a great book. I did not expect the film to capture all the plotlines, minor characters, and intricate themes of the 1100-page book, but I thought at least the acting, staging, and writing would be competent. They weren't. Tim Curry did a good job as Pennywise the clown, but here's the thing--""It"" is not supposed to just be a clown; that is only one of Its guises. It represents what people are most afraid of, and embodies the evil in the town of Derry. All this is much easier to understand in the novel. If you don't have the patience to read the book, and the movie happens to be on TV, go ahead and watch it, but by no means should you spend any money on this thing."
5,WONDERFUL!!,I ADORED this movie! IT was great. And Ben Heller (young Stan) was a doll! He should have gone on with his acting career. He was talented.
2,pretty good,this movie would be better if the movie wasn't always comstantly slow. I think it has a good plot but they do not give this movie a good effect and its lacks the scare and the mantanitly and seriousness of its kind
3,IT Will get in your head and drive you to a premature death,"....PSYCHE! Ok, enough of that. I, like many other people, agree on the fact that the book is much better than the movie, and to you, young reader, if you decide to go ahead and read the book, then i suggest you watch the film first. Why? Because you dont know what you are getting in when you start reading. In my case, i watched the film when i was about 11, and it scared the hell out of me. When i read the book, at age 18, i was somewhat prepared for the story i was getting into, it was still scary as hell, and made the movie seem like a 2 hour Bozo the clown special on how to scare the hell out of annoying kids. Therefore i recomend you first watch the film, so when you read the book, youll get seasures instead of a big heart attack. See ya!"
