1,This book is not geared to XP Server users,"I didn't realize when I purchased this book, that it was apparently written and published prior to the XP Server version of software becoming availalbe. Therefore, that version of the software is not covered in this book. Since the server software is apparently quite different from the ""Home"" or ""Professional"" versions, the book has been unhelpful.This is not a criticism, just letting people know."

5,Great Transaction!,"I chose to order this text online, based on bookstore prices. The cost of the book was excellent and I saved money even with shipping. The seller advertised the book as used/very good. The book seems brand new, which is always a pleasant surprise. It came neatly packaged and shrink wrapped. While the USPS claimed delivery on February 22, I received the package today, after ordering it on Thursday, January 31. Very pleased with this transaction!"
5,"This book is a ""Bible"" for K-2 teachers!!!","Last year I used the approaches advocated in this book in my first grade classroom. It was extremely successful! Every student left first grade reading and most were highly enthusiastic. I suggest combining the methods in here with the books titled Mosaic of Thought, Word Matters and Making Words."
5,An excellent resource book for eductors,"Guided Reading and Word Matters (by same authors) are excellent resource books for educators and parents who are actively teaching their children literacy skills. Both books are ""reader-friendly"" and full of practical ways to help children experience success in language arts. I strongly recommend both books when I present workshops to primary-grade educators."
1,useless,when i put my cell in this case i immediately lost my signal. it didnt matter where i was it would do the same thing all the time.
4,Very great debut album,The band that folks consider pop or not true rock masters as they enjoy what they do - make great music and not bring drama. Almost all the songs are classics and a truly fun band.
4,A Classic!,"A great piece of classic rock n' roll. Some tracks have a definite oldies feel to them, while others are a dirtier, grittier style of rock n' roll. Can't go wrong with either, in my book! My main complaint is that their studio sound is just a little too polished, and it takes the edge and rawness off of their sound."
5,It rules!,"It was love at first listen, and it always blows me away.Stellar collection of songs. Thank heaven for this band."
5,what a sound!,"I was already 23 years old when I first heard this album. I still loved the Beatles, but had moved into different musical areas by the late 70s, and thought that these guys were just too juvenile. Boy, was I a fuddy-duddy! I recently pulled this out and dusted it off after many years, and was instantly reminded how great a guitarist and songwriter (actually, hookwriter) Neilson was. Ben E. Carlos is incredible, and Jack Nicolson's production is perfect. I can't wait to hear this on CD, remastered. I will probably have to replace a few windows after the first listen.The only other band I can think of that combines such a pop sensibility with such power is the Move, particularly on their Shazam album. If you like these guys, you owe it to yourself to seek out that album.Also, I must say that I think Heaven Tonight is this album's equal."
5,They never produced a better disc.,"Cheap Trick's lightning bolt into the rock world. Contains the best power-pop single of the 1970's (""Oh Candy""). Incredible energy. Huge, complex, blistering guitar playing. The liner notes talk about Robin Zander being the man of a thousand voices. It's true. Feels like you're listening to the band playing live but with the mix of a great studio album. They never, ever had this level of energy on any recording again."
5,This Is Rock n' Roll!,"Cheap Trick's debut LP is pure genius; raw, aggresive, and beautifully melodic. I've never heard a better marriage of animalistic rock n' roll aggression & wonderful Beatlesque melodies. Producer Jack Douglas teamed up with a lean, young Cheap Trick at their creative zenith & crafted an LP thats truly a work of art. After 22 years of listening to it I still get chills everytime I turn it on. ""He's A Whore"" is the most viscious 3 minutes of rock music you'll ever tackle. ""Mandocello"" is a beautiful, haunting, utterly original masterpiece that ranks with Lennon/McCartney. You must buy this album!"
4,Ad-libs Galore!,"If you're a fledgling Joplin listener/player...don't buy this set. Instead, buy the Joshua Rifkin disc. The reason I say this is because Rifkin plays the pieces as written. You can follow along verbatim on the written page. This collection is full of ad-libs and ornaments. There are few consistent tempos throughout a piece. John Arpin is obviously full of energy and freedom of expression, but he strays too far away from the notes as written by the master. There's nothing wrong with playing Joplin's music that way (I ab-lib when playing ""Maple Leaf Rag""), but I think it's unfair to bias people with your interpretation until they have properly heard the piece played as written.Pros of this set:-it is a complete collection of Joplin's rags-""Bethena"" is beautiful (but, it is hard to screw that one up)Cons:-No music from ""Treemonisha"" (Joplin's opera). The Rifkin set doesn't offer any music from the opera either.-The bass drowns out the melody lines in many of the pieces."
5,Scott Joplin music,I needed some Scott Joplin music to use as background for a play I was directing. This boxed set gave me all I could possibly use! I'm very pleased with my purchase.
5,Love Rags,This is the best collection of rags available. No music collection is complete without it.
1,The Complete Piano Music of Scott Joplin,"I have one word to say if you are considering buying this set-DON'T! The performer, John Arpin, has absolutely no style or feel for ragtime whatsoever. Scott Joplin wrote his ragtime pieces to be played exactly as he wrote them, and these CD's are as far from that as possible. If Scott Joplin were to hear his pieces butchered this badly, he would probably wish to die of syphilus again. This is a huge waste of money, don't be fooled."
5,Great DVDs!!,My 9 month old son is not interested in the Baby Einstein movies at all...so I was a little skeptical about these. I bought the CD for the car (God of Wonders) and he loved it so much I thought...why not buy the DVDs. He really likes seeing the other babies on the screen...he even waved at one last night! So cute! This is a great alternative to Baby Einstein...and it has wonderful Christian songs!! I cannot wait for them to come out with more!
5,Heart Music,"My little 7 month old grandson loved it...as well as his 4 year old brother and 6 year old sister! They especially like the children's voices. You can change who sings. Amazing. Good choice of music that touches the soul, no matter the age!"
5,"If you want rap at it's best, get Bad Azz's cd it's phat yo!","Bad Azz brings it all together in this masterpiece of an album. Move over Biggie and 'Pac, cause it's Bad Azz's turn, and he keeps it real. Pure rap is all i can say every track is da bomb yo, so this is an easy five star cd without a doubt!"
5,THIS IS A TIGHT AZZ CD,THIS CD IS SO TIGHT DOGG ESPECIALLY THAT SONG WE BE PUTTIN IT DOWN WITH SNOOP DOGG THAT IS A PHAT TRACK. GET THE ALBUM IT IS BANGEN.DPG FOR LIFE.
3,good...,"buy one for your child is enough....please let us to choice the colorI got 2 , all are green"
2,Okay,"They are a great product if your child takes to the trainer set, other wise, inquisitive children get distracted by them, specially because of the color choices instead of making them clear or white."
3,"Nice, but not must have","I purchased them so my 12 months old will start holding bottle by himself, they really didn't do the trick. And my DS started holding bottle by himself without handles. If I knew, I wouldn't bought them, because we never used them."
3,good idea but the avent sippy cups are not good,"this is a good idea but the avent sippys ALWAYS leaked on me , so i cant really recommend this as in the end handles may be useful but the cup is not so what is the point of getting this?Switch to another sippy cup. Playtex proved to be very useful without any leaks. DO REPLACE SIPPY CUPS ATLEAST EVERY 6 MONTHS. They all made of plastic and they can all build up in the bacteria no matter how you wash it. Just replace it"
4,Good handles,These work perfectly with the avent bottles but you need to buy spouts too. Then you can use these as sippy cups.
4,helpful for little hands to learn how to hold a bottle,"These do just as promised, and we started using them at three months when we switched to bottles exclusively. The first day we used them our girl clutched on with a little help, and through one year she would play with them and hold on while eating. Better than a smooth bottle to learn how to grab on. We have since bought the ""training cup"" or whatever it's called from Avent, and I was happy to see that these handles transition to the cup, too. It's always nice when a product has a longer life, especially when it's for babies!"
4,Heavy But Good,"I bought this product based on the good reviews and I have to agree that it works great. It cuts very easily and without the pizza moving around too much. It gets through thick crust wonderfully. The only drawback was that it was a little too heavy for a pizza cutter. It feels like a metal paperweight. But, it works great, so I can't complain too much."
1,Not recommended,"The performances are dull and dragging, but the greatest problem with this collection is the 3rd Symphony, whose first HALF of its 2nd movement have been CUT! (If you're not familiar with this piece, that includes about 7 minutes of music). For serious Beethoven fans, there are many fabulous and exciting box sets of Beethoven's Symphonies, Szell, Karajan (1963 recording), even Solti, and then Gardiner and Hogwood on period instruments (the latter two are such fast performances as to be especially thrilling). For those new to classical music and Beethoven, I'd recommend buying the symphonies one at a time, maybe even from some of the conductors listed above."
1,I can NOT follow the math and NO CODE!,"You better already know the basics of Monte Carlo Simulationto get anything out of the book.I STRONGLY disagree with one reviewer who thinksall one needs to know is :1) The definition of Brownian Motion and2) What a Probability distribution is.FAT chance.The book requires knowing Linear Algebra, Probability,PDEs, Stochastic Modelling, and SDEs to be of any use.Where's the CODE, baby!There are very few examples put into code!One reviewer on Amazon.com, says the book is sodetailed you don't need code. Funny, I have neverseen anything ""so detailed"" that an example (code)would make the explanation less clear!"
3,CD does not work,It is a book for mathematics lovers not financial oriented profesionals. I would not recomend this book for those looking to gain more practical knowledge on this subject.
3,Oxford Dictionary of Law,"As for the dictionary itself, it's really good. Contains lots of information useful for any lawyer civil or criminal or etc. Contains any term you might need to know in law. So for it's content I'd give it 5 stars. But the reason I gave 3 stars is that the edition quality really dissapointed me. The paper quality is very poor - I honestly didn't expect this. If the paper quality gets better, for it's content, dictionary definitely deserves 5 stars."
4,New Shakespeare Teacher,"As a first year English teacher, the thought of teaching Shakespeare intimidated me. Thankfully, a more experienced teacher loaned me a copy of this book. It was a lifesaver. It gave me a place from which to start. The helpful vocabulary lists and exercises, as well as the pre and post reading activities gave me terrific ideas to use in the classroom. I immediately ordered my own copy of this book. I will not hesitate to loan it to the newest English teacher down the hall."
5,NEVER SAW BEFORE,I REMEMBER THE CISCO KID SERIES ON SUNDAY AM AFTER WONDERAMA BUT NEVER HEARD OF THE MOVIES. GILBERT ROWLAND STARRED IN THE SIX MADE AND HE IS BRILLIANT. GREAT SHORT MOVIES...WORTH A LOOK.
3,NOT Made in U.S.A!!!!,"The flag works well for it's purpose... however, it is NOT Made in the U.S.A!!!! I specifically looked for an American flag made in AMERICA, but the label clearly states Made in China :( Disappointing."
3,Decent pressure,"Lots of different spray options, if you like that. Water pressure is superior to other shower heads I've tried. Only problem is, on regular spray, stream is very widespread. Would be best in showers with very low hook-ups."
1,over priced,theses clothes pins were way over priced for the quality..these same clothes pins can be purchased at half the cost//and no shipping fees to pay.
1,1.5 Stars,In The Mouth Of Madness is wack lyrically and production wise. Luni Coleone is a wack rapper who shouldn't be allowed to touch a mic. NOT a recommended album.
1,Stick wit brotha lynch,Horrible cd I can't believe I even paid money for this. AAfter I went home and popped it in I realized how bad it was and bud didn't even make it better. He claims to be sicc but if you want the true siccness just stick with brotha lynch.
5,A TERRIFIC Film,"Wow! This movie was entertaining from start to finish. The first story was perhaps the stongest from a narrative point of view. It was also the most suspenseful. I must say, I did not see that ending coming. The second story was the most emotional. Very intense and it had plenty of dark humor. My favorite was the last story. This was the most fun and I am partial to vampires. Great music, great cinematography and effects and the actors were great all around. I can't wait to watch it again.Comment"
2,Word of Awrning,"First off, a word of warning. This movie and the 2007 All Hallows Eve version (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0016PNM9Y/ref=docs-os-doi_0) are EXACTLY the same movie. I guess someone decided to repackage the movie for a new release.Beyond that, this is a low budget indie horror movie. Minimal blood, minimal nudity.Not great, but not that bad. I've paid more to watch worse."
3,Is this believable or what?,"I am an avid Diana fan and was anxious to read this book upon its being published. I am not sure how to take this book. There were lots of facts, but some could have been taken from other sources, and after having read thisbook, you wonder if this person really knew Diana or not. Also, people keep pointing out supposed flaws which generally happen to normal people without the blink of an eye (i.e., no panties chapter). Anyway, other books were better but it was an interesting read."
1,How to make a few dollars out of sensational gossip!,I love the way that the author tries to justify herself at the start of the book by saying that Diana wanted her to write this book.Somehow I doubt that Diana would have been anxious for a trusted employee to let the world know that Diana went out without underwear on when she was wearing tight clothing or that she suffered from regular bouts of PMT. Too much information! - not things that a loyal friend would say.
1,load of bunkum,This is the biggest load of trash I have ever read. A complete fabrication by the author IMO. I'm just glad Diana is not around to read this utter rubbish.
2,Pretty until it arrived!,I purchased this mirror for my friend as a birthday gift. I neglected to open and inspect it because I didn't want to mess anything up. I gave it to her and immediately noticed the corner caps that hold the rods were all crooked. I tried to fix it but noticed all of the screw holes weren't aligned properly. She was so nice about it that she didn't want to say anything. I kept apologizng to her and was not only disappointed but embarressed. I now will have to buy another one but a different type. Good luck!
2,got what I paid for,"Although the mirror and glass rods are nice, the corner pieces holding everything together are the cheapest possible plastic. It wouldn't take much to break them. My daughter is happy and I can't complain too much- I got what I paid for."
2,Not what I expected.,"With a name like ""Kiss My Face"" I was hoping for soap with a pleasant smell but it smells like wet cardboard. Very unappealling muddy green color. It doesn't lather up very well and didn't seem to have any moisterising effect at all. I gave it two stars because it rinses well."
2,you can do better,"this was my first flat iron. since then, i've learned a lot about my hair, straightening, and hair tools and products. The hairdryer was fine. I was happy with the flat iron at first, but never acheived the results I really wanted. I was only happy b/c I didn't know better. Now, I will only use Chi flat irons. I know it sounds snobby, but it is completely worth the extra money!"
5,One of the best series of all time!,"This series brings back such nostalgic memories to me. Anyone that is a fan of comedy, their library is not complete without this series!"
1,No way would I buy this,"Why would you want to reward bad behavior by buying this set? Shanachie has done an incredibly bad job in producing this package.Why on earth would I want to buy a ""complete series"" that wasn't in series order?No booklet or other information about air dates, so I have to research on my own if I want to watch them in the correct order.This is just stupid, and I refuse to make Shanachie any richer by buying this lame, utterly brainless package.Show some class, Shanachie, and withdraw this product until you can do it right.Until then, I'll watch the show on YouTube for free."
1,car 54 where are you?,"THE FIRST TIME ON DVD WHAT A SCREW UP THIS COMPANY SHOULD REDO THE FIRST SEASON AND SEND A NEW COPY WITH THE SHOW IN THE PROPER ORDER IT WAS MADE AND SEND THE PROPER ORDER DVD SET TO THE PEOPLE WHO ORDERED THROUGH AMAZON.COM AS A REPLACEMENT FOR THE INCORRECT EPISODE ORDER THEY PUT THE EPISODE ORDER LIKE THIS DISC#1 EPISODE 6,19,15,23 26,24,25,5. DISC#2 EPISODE 4,28,16,11,9,27,30,29. DISC#3 EPISODE 13,14,7,22,12,1,17,21. DISC#4 EPISODE 2,8,10,20,3,18. HOW MANY TIMES DO I HAVE TO CHANGE THE DVD TO SEE CAR 54 WHERE ARE YOU IN THE CORRECT ORDER? MAYBE SHANACHIE.COM CAN GIVE US THE BLUE PRINT. YOU ONLY HAVE TO CHANGE THE DVD 19 TIMES TO WATCH 30 EPISODES IN ORDER. WHAT A TREAT! DAVE BLANCHETTE HOPES THIS EPISODE ROAD MAP HELPS."
4,Grreat video Quality is the only thing great about this set.,"How hard is it for video company to understand what the tv on DVD customers want. We been saying the same thing for the last decade (All we want is safe and simple packaging for the DVD set that is easy to remove and replace the discs without scratching them, Unedited episodes with original music if possible and in original airdate order) and still they don't listen. Case in point right here. Packaging so badly made it look like something they bought from the video dept. of INSANE 'R US and my theory on how they chose the episode order goes like this: they pin the episode list to the wall of their office and threw darts at the list and where the darts landed is the episode order. How many people agree with me."
2,Great show!,"Absolutely enjoyed watching this classic program. However, when I opened the case the packaging seemed a little slipshod and I was afraid that I would have problems playing the discs. I have had no problems playing it so far and I look forward to watching this one again and again! Unfortunately, we received TWO disc 3s and NO disc 4. We have not been able to watch the last episodes."
3,Car 54,If your and old time TV buff like I am you will enjoy this DVD My only complaint is it was a 4 disc set and it contained 2 disc 3s and no disc 4. But for the price and the 3 great CD's I am glad that I purchased it.
4,Episodes are out of order,"I just opened my copy of the First Season set and noticed right away that theepisodes are not shown in chronological order.The first episode on Disk 1 is ""What Happened to Thursday"" which is episode nr. 22. The next one - ""No More Pickpockets"" is episode 25. ""Who's for Swordfish"" the first episode to air on TV is listed sixth - Episode nr. 2 - ""Something Nice for Sol"" is shown as the third episode on Disk 3.Not a major complaint - I'm certainly glad to have these episodes remastered.It's not like there's an episode where Toody and Muldoon meet for the first time.Enjoy"
3,great 60s comedy,"Thanks for finally putting this series out on dvd. It was a very funny comedy and I look forward to seeing it again. Have not seen it since it was first on the air.UPDATE: I wish to also complain about the order on the disks and the lousy packaging. I have the episode list of prodcast order and I am watching in correct order, but having to watch first disk 1 then disk 4 is annoying. But I am still glad to have the set and will buy season 2."
1,Car 54 Where Are You?,"When you receive Car 54 Where Are You, make sure to check the package ASAP. When I opened mine, I have two disk threes, and no disk four."
1,Big Problems with Disc 4,"Like another reviewer I was treated to a documentary on Haiti on Disc 4, not the remaining episodes. Other reviewers say that they've received two disc 3s and no disc 4 -- buyers beware!"
3,mixed up episode order,"quality is very good, but why are the episodes not in broadcast order???? what a treasure hunt. but still glad it is finally out."
5,CHECK YOUR DISC 4 !!!!,"I put my disc 4 in last night and got the same thing a Haitian doc. I contacted both, Amazon and Shanachie and here is some info: called Shanachie @ 18004971043 and they said they will send me a disc4 replacement and I also contacted Amazon and they offered me a discount on the purchase. I will see if and when the new disc 4 arrives to see what I get.Oct 26, 2011 Received the replacement disc 4 today !! thank you Shanachie Entertainment."
2,Very cheaply made socks.,These are very cheaply made socks. The material is thin and they are not at all comfortable. They haven't washed well.
3,three and ahalf stars,"cover versions of mostly Booker T and the MGs songs, if you like Memphis Soul, then this is a good CD for you. I guess the other reviewer was expecting to hear something else, but that is what this CD is and is supposed to be.........."
4,the dinner time pop up book,"this is a majic book , now sadly out of date.I was so happy to find a copy in good condition, and share it with the new generation of babies. However I was stunned at the price I had to pay to have this small book shipped to Australia - $41 !!\I asked the dealer, but she wrote that it was Amazon that chose the postage price!"
4,A very decent book,"This book is not designed for the hardcore anthropology student as it doesn't delve into the extreme details of the subject, but it does give a very broad overview of the millions of years of human prehistory. Most of the time is spent talking about the journey from ape-like ancestors to the origin of food production and the large state-run societies that we have today. Therefore, when Fagan talks about specific cultures and societies he just gives an overview, he chooses to put most details to use describing why and how humans got to where they are today. Very good book is you want an effective and interesting introduction to human origins, but this isn't something that would be used for a 300 or 400 level class."
3,misleading,"not what it said it was, and not the eigth edition and hard cover like it said it was. it is eight the 2nd edition and not the 8th"
5,ON HOLY GROUND DEVOTIONAL,"I WAS GIVEN THIS AS A GIFT OVER 5 YEARS AGO AND HAVE GIVEN IT MANY TIMES TO OTHERS SINCE. AFTER 5 YEARS, I STILL CLEAVE TO IT EACH DAY AS IT BRINGS FORTH THE TRUTH OF THE WORD IN AN AMAZINGLY SIMPLE, EASY TO APPLY WAY. I LOVE IT AND WOULD RECCOMEND IT TO ANYONE WHO DESIRES TO STRENGTHEN THEIR WALK WITH THE LORD."
5,On Holy Ground,"The devotional, ""On Holy Ground: A Daily Devotional"" was purchased as a gift. The receiver is thrilled with it. It has more depth then many devotionals. I would order again."
1,Obviously very old,"I was so excited when my Butterfinger BBs came in the mail. I finally got them open and popped one in my mouth, and experienced one of the worst tastes of my life. I can't even describe it, but it took gratuitous amounts of other food and drinks to get the taste out. Totally not worth the $8 I paid, and I'm pretty upset."
3,John Williams is not the best out there,"For Koyunbaba specifically, the best recording is the album Libra Sonatine by Yoshiaki Kamata. Although Williams is clear and technically perfect, there is a lack of passion and emotion that other guitarists evoke."
2,Where are the composer credits?,"As always, Williams's playing and choices are top-notch, and there is a great mix of guitar solos and guitar+ensemble, so I enjoy listening to this CD often. Why only two stars? My Sony CD lists the cuts--but nowhere on the whole CD does it credit the composers! Most of us know that Domeniconi wrote ""Koyunbaba"" and probably we could find the composers of most of the other cuts using Google, but why no notes on the pieces, the composers, anything like that? Is Sony saving big bucks by omitting this information?Anyway, as Amazon suggests, I would have wanted to know, before buying this CD, that they didn't list the composers or include any liner notes about the pieces and composers."
5,Thoughtful and very amusing,As a dog owner and lover of animals in general I found this book to be a must! Smith is very keen to remind us that our pets are not just animals but members of our family and their loyalty has no boundries.
5,SPLENDID READING,"I HAD A JOY IN READING THIS..CHUCKLED ALOT AND A WARM ALL OVER FEEL GOOD BOOK TO CURL UP AND READ, AND TO LIFT YOUR SPIRITS UP...EVERYONE SHOULD READ THIS AND THEY'LL SEE WHAT I MEAN AND MAYBE APPLY SOME OF IT TO THEIR OWN LIVES."
4,A Pleasant Surprize,"At first you might think this pairing of John Klemmer and Oscar to be a bit unusual-and it is. What you find however, are two artists who complement each other beautifully. With the ocean in the backround throughout, these two cover an interesting range of material in an informal jam format. Worth buying if you can find it."
4,This was a much needed subject to read about..,"The term ""passing"" in this book referred to black people who were light enough to pass for white and sad to say some of the tried. Eulie Giles was the stepmother who brought her children up the wrong way. She taught them to accept people by the color of their skin, family background, social status and income. I really enjoyed reading this book it was touching. The ending made tears come to my eyes and really suprised me! If you are thinking about getting this one do your self a favor and do so. It will bring unexpected pain, tears and joy. Thanks Patricia Jones for a insightful read!"
4,A SAD PASSING,"PASSING is about one Black woman's (Eulelie Giles) desire to erase her lowly past and PASS as something more than (or better) she actually is. She develops an elegant false history, marries the ""correct"" type of man and attends only high society functions. She has no children of her own so she rears her formerly widowed husband's four children to think like she does. The result is an ""out-of-touch"" reality and all-around unhappiness. More than admired, this family is viewed as snobbish, self-righteous and pretentious. Eulelie goes through life thinking that everyone is fooled, and it is only at the end of the book that realizes she is the one in the dark."
5,Thought provoking,A must read! A book everyone should read. Ms. Jones did a excellent job of portraying the feelings and emotions of all her characters. This book was so good that I had to cancel my Saturday appointments because I couldn't put it down.
3,Thought Provoking,"I enjoyed this novel even though at times I found it too wordy. Some of the points got lost in a mass of words and descriptions. I think at times the author tried to add a ""Toni Morrison-esqe"" flair and it just did not work. Sometimes the point is made better just simply said. Other than that, I found the book rather thought provoking. It shedded light on a lot of issues that still go on today in the black community. Hopefully there will be many more Lila's in the world who finally get it. We are not the enemy. We do not have to put on masks and hide behind them."
5,outstanding,"I found this book to be very thought-provoking. Coming from a family with the same viewpoints on color and social status as Eulelie had, I can very well understand the way that this family was brought up. This is a sad legacy that some of our foreparents gave to us but as Eulelie found out, the truth will come out. I would advise anyone who wants to understand the multi-colored families to read this book."
2,What a con job!,"This book is greatly misleading. The preview summary, which is on the back cover of the book, doesn't hold true to the book's contents at all. The true main characters are not even mentioned in the preview. Also, the most disappointing thing about this book is the fact that the first 80% of the book was wasted in building up a suspense drama, only to be abruptly converted into some secret romance novel at the end. The author went off in a direction that did not bring out the best in a book that could of received a 5-star rating if it kept on course with it's main story. Very disappointing!"
2,I could have passed....,"I found all the characters in Passing to be very superficial and unrealistic. I am not denying that this type of discrimination exists, but the author did a poor job portraying the lives of the characters. The story was about everbody and nobody. Most of the characters had no personality of their own and even their attempts to get a personality failed. So, read this book when there is absolutly nothing else to read!"
2,Propery identify all organization by correct name.,"Mrs. Jones, I just want to inform you as an author, that research about organizations and their proper names are very important when written in a book. DON'T IDENTIFY THEM AS A GROUP when they are known and very very indentified under another DISTINGISHED AND IMPORTANT STATUS."
4,Are These People for Real!,"The light skinned/dark skinned saga was always fascinating to me and this book was no different. This book about classism is a good read featuring Mrs. Eulelie Giles. Mrs. Giles was ruthless in her treatment of her children and the people around her but she had a lot of gull. My one disappointment was not exposing Eulelie to others. However I was amazed that her secret was known to more folks than she knew. This was an excellent twist and it explained Gil's questions and comments throughout the book. Patricia Jones' writing style is one that is picturesque; I could see and feel the landmarks of Baltimore. Some portions were rather drawn out and I was shouting ""get to it"". The children were spoiled, obnoxious and so unreal. Camilla Hightower was a bright light that I found myself cheering on! I was glad that Sandra found true happiness. I hope that people like them do not exist today but I know that's not the case. Good Subject matter and good job Ms. Jones."
4,Cookie Making Resources,"Grandma and Ben are making cookies--from scatch--starting with the cow. Grandma shows Ben the source of all the ingredients in their honey cookies. This excellent story is illustrated with bright energetic paintings and provides young children with an understanding of natural, human, and capital resources necessary to create a favorite food. These basic economic concepts are taught in many elementary schools."
1,"Too much minutia, not enough strategic picture","This book has an enormous amount of small details (i.e., exact airwings participating in specific battles, etc.). The problem is that there is so much of this detail that it bores and swamps the reader with respect to the greater picture. There should have been much more emphasis on strategic considerations and history at higher level. If you are a deep and serious history buff in this niche of history then this book would be a four star for you but, for aforementioned reasons, for the general history interested in overview of the subject the book would only rank one star."
2,"Cool industrial design, poor engineering.","I bought this monitor from j and r over the phone which saved my 10 dollars on my purchase and since i live in nyc i picked it up from the store, downtown. I was so excited to plug it up noticing how beautiful the outside design was beautiful. I hooked everything up and found the picture to be terrible. I fixed the contrast, brightness to the best possible and the picture became a bit more clear however, i still noticed the blurriness whenever there was fast motion and text is still pretty blurry. In addition, the picture is very grainy and does not have much color depth.I thought maybe it was just the TV, but I was wrong. I used the monitor function, and found the quality of the monitor was even worse! I tested some text by opening an internet explorer window. The text seemed to blur every other character, and when I moved the window around the blurriness would move as well.Overall, this monitor is mediocre and will be returning it promptly."
3,This gel is good as a foaming bath ...,"This gel is good as a foaming bath (in relatively large quantities), but I found its smell to be too close to the smell of Listerine to be considered pleasant."
2,The first thing noticeable about this product is ...,"The first thing noticeable about this product is the smell. It's very medicinal and not appealing at all. I used it for three days until I just couldn't stand the smell anymore. If you can get past that, it's very soothing, lathers nicely, and leaves skin soft. Because of the smell alone, I don't think I'd purchase this product again or suggest it to my friends."
1,Very disappointing!,"It was not a boxed set; only 1 CD. I had the boxed set previously (at least 4 discs as I recall, maybe 5 or 6). While the one disc was beautiful, I was quite disappointed not to have the ones I remembered, and very disappointed in this level of service."
1,Can't get beyond the hate.,"This book was in an ""emotions themed"" pack sold by Scholastic. The other two books, Today I Feel Silly: And Other Moods That Make My Day and The Way I Feel were great. Goldie is Mad however will not be read a second time in our home simply because the girl in this story can not navigate her anger in any other way but to say that she ""hates"" her little brother. I know that my preschooler has used this word in the past however when the issue came up we discussed how we should not ""hate"" anyone or anything and thus she needed to find a new way to express her frustration. When reading this book for the first time we came to the page which states that ""Veronica hates baby spit. I hate baby spit. I hate Nicholas!,"" my preschooler gasped and said ""That is not a nice way to talk about your brother, is it Mom?"" Simply stated, we will not be keeping a book in our house which endorses the concept of hate."
5,excellent camcorder bag,"pretty much a universal camcorder bag. very sturdy. nice design with extra compartments. cost-to-value ratio is low, i.e. a good buy."
5,Compact and sturdy camcorder bag!,"If you're looking for a camcorder bag that'll safely protect your camcorder while not adding bulk, then I'd recommend this one. I have a Canon Vixia HF G10 inside it and I've been able to put all the accessories in the pockets all around this bag. Doesn't leave much room on the inside when the camcorder is in there, but this is actually what I wanted out of a camcorder bag; to hold it in there snugly and safely just in case. I own photography equipment which I carry around in a photographer bag and this pouch can actually fit right inside it making it easier to carry around with me along with my other goodies. That bag is also a Lowpro, Slingshot 200 (newer version is 202), which I also highly recommend. Lowepro just does it right, period."
4,turkiye,If you want a bag for a camcorder this is it. Is a bit small but well padded and will acccomodate a Sony camcorder and cables. Well constructed and fairly light. Has a belt loop which is a neat suprise.
5,Camera bag,This was the perfect bag for my Canon PowerShot SX30IS at a great price. Everything fits inside with room to spare.
5,Nice camcorder bag,This bag was perfect for my small camcorder plus cords and battery charger. It is the perfect size for traveling. Instruction manuals may not fit if they are too big but other than that-I love the bag.
3,Hello France,"I really did not think the book was what I expected. By the time I received the book, I had booked my hotel online. There could have been more photo's of accomodationMargaret Gordon"
4,I really like the idea of a pump ...,"I really like the idea of a pump instead of an aerosol-type dispenser. The peppermint gave my skin a tingly-cool feeling after my shave. You have to make sure to rub it enough to get a good lather, but it's worth it!"
4,"Fun, Clear and Thorough","As a private voice teacher and big fan of the ""for Dummies"" series of books, I found this book to be fun, clear and thorough. The Dummies series is known for its unique ability to take technically complex subject matter and break the concepts down in a simple, clear and entertaining way. This book is no exception. While Pamelia S. Phillips does a wonderful job of tackling in-depth topics, I think most beginners will have a difficult time digesting and applying all of the information."
4,"Informative, helpful, and easy to read + excellent CD!","I've always wanted to learn more about singing and this did the trick. It's easy to read and explains not just how to improve but why using these methods will help you improve. Plus, the included CD takes you through vocal warm ups and exercises that you can do over and over to gradually strengthen your voice and extend your vocal range."
3,Singing for Dummies,"As an online vocal tutor, I sometimes refer to this book as I find it useful for singers who are just beginning to find out about their voice, and how it is affected by posture. I like the fact that the book deals with the techniques and mechanics of singing and also touches upon vocal range and even performance anxiety!A very good all round book!Chip Jenkins[...]"
2,lousy if you want to be a rock singer,"If you're a teen who wants to be on American Idol, maybe this is the book for you. If you want to learn how to sing for a rock band, it is definitely not. The people who sing the exercises and samples on the CD are opera and musical theater singers. Most of the exercises are extremely lame and haven't helped me in the least. I found one or two chapters to be of interest, and that's the only reason I'm giving it 2 stars instead of 1. Way too much of the text in the book is what I consider filler, nothing that's going to help me improve my singing. All in all, my recommendation is to not waste good money on this book. Buy it used, if at all."
3,Not what I needed.,Vender is top notch. Book is not what I expected. Would purchase from again. Shipped quickly. Exactly as described. What more can I say!
2,Very boring to read and very limited with regard to style,"Although there is some factual info that one can learn from, the book is very boring to read. This book only places focus on singing in one style which is the style of singing they tried to teach you in high school chorus class. There is no contempory point of view such as Rock singing and all in all I think there are much better books out there. Mark Baxter's book is much more informative and is much more to fun to read."
2,Not what I thought.,"I am a beginner and I did not like the book. I thought it was going to talk about how to sing. It had plenty of info. about posture, music vocabulary words, and what to expect from singing different types of music but the stuff about actual singing seemed to me more like something for the beginning of a chorus class or something. It just explained what stuff is but not exactly how to do it. There are some other books that explain more about your voice and specifics about how to sing. Sorry."
4,Great starting point,"Great book overall. The author got to the point and didn't over-emphasize any part that wasn't important or relevant. The only reason why I can't give it 5 stars is because my voice teacher disagrees with some aspects, so until I can figure out who's right and who's wrong, I don't know which way to sway. But the CD is by far the best part. After reading the whole book and getting the recommended songs, I still do the CD occasionally. The only gripe I have about the CD is there's no just straight out warm-up session. It's all practice, no warm-ups, which would have made the CD useful after you've learned what you can from the book."
1,"""Alex, I'll take Bubble Gum Music for a hundred""","Okay...so you're a leggy brunette""Ms. Twain, Mr. Osmond...your table is ready."""
1,Made me feel like jumping off a cliff!!!!,"This song is the most annoying song I have ever heard! First of all, it is not country music. Secondly, she points out that she does not want intelligence or someone who looks handsome, just someone who satisfies her physically, which I think is just pathetic. Finally, that ridiculous talking in the middle of the song! Drop it because it makes the whole song sound dumb. In closing, ""So you're Shania, That don't impress me at all!"""
5,"Shania Does It Again ""Impress"" The hottest song of 1999!!!","There is only one word to express the talant of Shania Twain. ""Fabalous"" She is hard working, and actually loves what she does. ""That don't impress me much"" is one of the hottest singles to be released from the Come On Over album. This single is a must have for any shania fan!!"
1,Here We Go Again,"From an album of bad songs comes what turns out to be the worst of all. At first I thought the treacly You're Still The One was the worst - compare Shania's version with the solid 1970s rocker of the same title to see how bad Shania's is - but Don't Impress surpasses it in idiocy. Not only does it basically urge women to sell themselves short for the sake of some action, the song fails in and of itself. Shania's singing lacks any kind of believable depth, suffering from a nauseating slur throughout. The backing track is like something from Weird Al Yankovic - for that matter, this song and its parent album deserve the Weird Al treatment."
1,The Anti-Classic!,"What is the anti-classic you ask? An un-timeless, annoying, stupid sell-out ""muzak"". First of all, she says, ""Okay, so you're Brad Pitt, but that don't impress me"". In ten years, nobody will identify with the song 'cause Brad Pitt won't be around then. Okay Shania, just because you BELONG in a pit doesn't impress me much. SELLOUT CITY THE HOMETOWN OF SHANIA TWAIN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
3,Slightly disapointing,"Intron Depot was highly entertaining. The follow up vol. 2 Blades, and vol. 3 Ballistic were progressively better in volume of color works, novelty, and plenty of eye-candy.Which is why I had no hesitation when purchasing ID4: Bullets - expecting heavy developmental and promotional art from his game genre. Which was not the case.In my opinion, comparing vol.4 to the previous IDs, Bullets has about 1/3 the amount of quality imagery such as finished character art and dynamic fully rendered images. The other parts are mostly nominal concept detail/art and light weight 3d models associated with some of the titles he worked on.I say if I were a fan of the games featuring his art, I would enjoy this book a lot more. It seems to fall short in the amount of complete renderings."
3,"Not as impressive as other ""Intron Depot"" Titles","Ever since I first laid eyes on Shirow's virtuoso work in the original ""Ghost in the Shell,"" I've enjoyed his singular style and hi outright mastery of digital art. As a result, I've been purchasing his Intron Depot books, which serve as great collections of his art. I've been pleased by the series overall, but in Intron Depot 4: Bullets, I've been a little disappointed. This book is largely composed of conceptual designs he did for video games, and there is little if any comic book/cover work, which made the other volumes so splendid. While Shirow's artistry in this book cannot be detracted, I just wasn't as impressed with the work in this volume - it wasn't what I was expecting, certainly. ID #s 1-3 are your best bet. I hope a 5th volume comes out soon..."
3,"Works great, but it's cheaper to buy at Wal Mart.","This product works great, but it's cheaper to get at Wal Mart. Works great for retainers. It makes a retainer (and I'm sure everything else it works for) smell good and cleaned, however, you have to soak it for 15 minutes."
5,Perfect for hard water,Bought these to use in my toilet due to hard water build up that was preventing the toilet from flushing at all. One of these every 3-4 weeks or so and things have been great. Highly recommended for this purpose!
1,kind of a dead end,i saw this for free on hulu. it was not the worst i've ever seen but i did not make it through the whole movie. some may find some merit. at least the girl making the documentary was kind of cute. i am glad i did not spend any money on this. it is definitely a low budget attempt.at least the people in the movie have not piled up a bunch of bs reviews to fool you into buying this one. at least not yet.
5,Great Book!,"This book is wonderful! It is not a light read though. Sprague's sentences are like the apostle Paul's. They can be very long. But I consider this book to be ""Spirit filled"". If you want to raise your daughter to be a virtuous woman and teach her how to have wisdom in relationships and wisdom in all of life's dealings, this book can go a long way in instruction towards that end. I just got onto Amazon to purchase the book again. I loaned my copy out years ago but now I want to read it again as I have granddaughters. I highly recommend this book."
2,Not worth the money,"I registered for this item, and received it as a shower present. The first time I opened the kit to take stuff out, the nail clippers broke. The bulb syringe seemed a bit stiff as well, but I never got the chance to use it since I took it back before my baby was born. Now that my son is 6 months old, I realize I would not have used half of the stuff in there. The only things I use often are nail clippers, files, nasal aspirator and a brush. You can buy better ones for less than the whole kit. Also, the hospital will provide you with a better nasal aspirator than anyone you can buy."
4,New Mom,"This is a really good kit to have around as it is easy to throw in a diaper bag and go. However, I took mine back finding that the smaller version is just as good. The smaller version has all the necessities and that seems to fit me better. This is a great kit, just not my preference."
5,Just Wonderful,A great idea for an infant or child. Everything that you need is in this little case. I have used the items not only for my 3 month old son. But also for my 5 year old daughter. a great product.
4,Excellent,This set has everything you need to take care of the baby at a great price. I highly recommend it to every parent. It combines two sets that are sold seperately and it is so convenient. It is a great thing to have.
3,"Not as pictured, but still great","The picture doesn't match the product, but it's still a great set. Word of warning though, don't try to sterilize the medicine dropper- it melts!"
2,Not worth it + clippers are scary,"This kit provides all the essentials, yes. But some simply don't work or, worse, they work badly. In the case of the medicine dropper having unreliable suction, so be it. However, the nail clippers are dangerous. I thought it was just my new mommy lameness that caused me to snip off the end of my baby's thumb. Then I bought some generic nail clippers for a couple of bucks that were so much easier to use, and don't result in spewing blood. The bulb syringe is pointless and doesn't compare to the one provided to us in the hospital. Likewise for the thermometer. Some of the grooming and teething items are useful, but you can pick up comparable or better ones anywhere. Overall, if you want a kit, I'd say avoid this one and try another brand."
2,Unimpressed,"The thing I use most in this kit is the hair brush. The nail files are okay. The medicine dropper was useless. It wouldn't suction up any medicine. The fingernail clipper is also useless. It's just an adult-sized one with an attachment. Should have gotten a baby-specific and -sized one even though right now I'm just trying to file their nails rather than clip then (on their pediatrician's advice). I'm using the nasal aspirators that we took from the hospital, which I'm told are the best. So, in all, if I were to do it again, I'd just buy the pieces one-by-one rather than in this kit since I haven't used much of it, and the parts that I have used, have mostly unimpressed me."
3,Did not recieve item pictured,"However, I do like the Deluxe Baby's Essential Kit from Summer Infant. It has pretty much the same products described in the listing. The only downside it that the case is not clear, it is green cloth. It does have a handle on it however, that is pretty handy. I use the bulb from the hospital more than this one. The themometer is nice because it has a wide base you can't insert to far, but it pretty difficult to get a good reading on. I do like the nail clippers though. They are very nice.Overall, a good item to get as a gift, but if you are buying yourself, pick it out at the store."
3,Good,It was much more economical to purchase the kit as opposed to buying everything individually. There are things that your baby will not use at least for a couple of months but it is very user friendly.The only downfall is that when the battery in the thermometer goes dead it cannot be replaced. I received mine with a dead battery so my thermometer is useless but there is also the forehead temperature reader so I am using that instead.This product isn't bad but when purchased try to get one with a reusable thermometer.
3,Good for the Money,"This item is good for the money. A couple of the items, like the digital thermometer seem a little cheaply made. On the other hand, the rubber grips on the tweezers and nail clipper are great. It also comes with a bulb suringe which is much better than the new bulbs that do not suck very well."
1,not really necessary,"to all first time mothers: this product is really not necessary! i bought it and im only using daily the brush and the nail clippers. I bought another thermometer since, this one wasnt very reliable, and all the other things are not really necessary."
1,waste of money- im sorry but all you need is a nail emery board or baby nail scissors,"Hospital gave me aspirators which work best. Also the nose frida aspirator works well too. Hospital also gave me thermometers which work fine as well. Hospital also gave me a soothies pacifier too. Other than those things, I felt like all the items in this pack was unnecessary and if I did need a pacifier or something, there's far better ones with better qualities out there.This product is cheaply made and bad quality. Had to return it without opening it after one look. Sorry for this bad review after not even opening the product but still I trust my eyes."
4,Nice Kit,"I love the kit. It has pretty much everything needed for my infant. However, the nose-bulb does not works (not enough suction). You better off asking the nurse from the hospital to give you one..it works very well and it is FREE!!!"
1,"So far, completely useless","I registered for this because it had a nail clipper and other seemingly useful items. After 2 months I haven't used a single thing. The nail clipper is an adult size, and I had to buy a baby one (about $2 at the drug store). The emery boards didn't work at all on the baby's soft nails. I use the nasal aspirator from the hospital. The baby bathtub we have has a built-in temperature sensor, but it is easy enough to just feel the water and know if it is right. Maybe once the baby is older, things in this kit will come in handy. Don't bother putting it on your registry- there are more important items that you need and this is a lot of money for nothing very useful."
2,Good Variety Not So Good Quality,"I like the variety this product offers, but after only using the nail clippers a couple of times, they broke- the top unsnaped from the bottom and I was unable to put it back together. The Nasal Aspirator is to thick to fit into the nose easily, especailly when your child doesn't like to have their nose sucked out anyways."
2,"Yeah, it's nice to have all the items, if they weren't cheaply made.","There are a few things in this kit I use all of the time...The nail clipper I love, the hair brush my 9 month old loves (I don't know why, but he finds it fascinating). But overall, this is cheaply made, and overpriced to boot. It's all made in china, I'm pretty sure it's not bpa free (I will never let my baby use the included teether or toothbrush), and some of it just doesn't work (for us, that would be the nasal aspirator-the free one we got from the hospital was far superior- and the thermometer, which broke after three uses, never read correctly). Seriously, go to target and look at other kits, or take my advice and buy each item separately..you'll be much happier."
2,don't waste your money,"seriously you only need baby nail scissors, clippers, a thermometer, and a bulb syringe...you get a bulb syringe from the hospital and a comb, too...the other things in the kit i haven't used...ask other mom and find out the items you really need and just buy those...for the money...not a good value"
1,Awful Set - Practically useless,"I'm not sure what the other reviewers are talkinga bout. We registered for this set and got it as a gift. I have used NOTHING from it. The green suction bulb is so hard I can't possibly get it to compress with one hand - its useless for suctioning babies nose, we used the one from the hospital. The same thing with the dropper. The tweezers were so hard to handle, I just used mine. The brush and comb are okay. The nail clippers are too difficult to see what you are doing and so I end up cutting my daughter's fingers - the nail scissors are too dull to cut her nails.Overall, this is a cheap set and I wouldn't recommend it."
1,Would not recommend to anyone.,"Nasal aspirator is too hard, and is of no use(the free one from the hospital is much better). The nail clipper is too big for a baby. The medicine dropper is also lousy. Hair Brush is only thing I like.It has soft bristles ideal for baby. Did not use other stuff. I do regret spending money on this. Would not recommend to anyone."
2,Cheap!,"I got this last weekend at my shower. I took it out to look at all the little pieces. The nail clippers came apart, the tweezers don't line up and the sticker on the thermometer is bent and crooked. I will be returning it and looking for something that will last."
1,Very disappointed,"I read the reviews for this set and was looking forward to having all of my baby's needs in one package. Unfortunately, many of the items don't work. The nail clippers, the nasal aspirator and the dropper are very weak. Most of the rest of these items you can buy individually and be guaranteed of the quality. I would not recommend purchasing this item."
1,It's a waste of money,"Your much better off getting another all in one kit. This kit hardly works. Everything just seems to big for the baby, the nail clipper the comb, the brush. The nail clipper works better on adults than infants."
3,Somewhat disappointing,"When I registered for this item, it seemed like a good, all-in-one kit. I have found the brush, comb, nail clippers and bathtub thermometer to be quite useful. BUT, the nasal aspirator is too hard to be of any use, and the medicine dropper is made of a similar, unflexible plastic. It's hard enough to use these items in general on an infant, but the products here turn it into a baby wrestling match. I ended up buying a separate nasal aspirator and a separate medicine dropper. In retrospect, I would have been better off registering for a grooming kit and then the individual ""medical"" items separately."
3,Better for older baby/child,"I wouldn't give this as a shower gift, some of the items really aren't geared for small infants.Otherwise a decent item.Nasal asperater, and combs that come from hospital are MUCH better than those in kit in my opinion, also the clippers seemed too large for delicate little baby nails"
2,so-so products,"I picked this set apart and most of the pieces never get used. The aspirator is too stiff and hard to clean. The clippers are pretty good. The sissors are too bulky. The tweezers aren't sharp enough. And the medicine dropper is too stiff to use. I bought a separate 10 second themomoter so this one is now my back-up. As a set its not worth the money, buy the pieces individually you get much better quality."
1,Not a neccesity,"I put this on my baby registry cause I thought it would be useful, but I found that it really isn't. The only things I use are the comb, brush, and nailclippers. The nasal aspirator is very weak. When you get medicine from your pharmacy they give you the measuring tools, and you're not supposed to use any other than what they give you. Other than the brush, and comb it just looks really nice on the bathroom cabinet."
1,Not worth it!,"The thermometer didn't work, and neither did the room temperature gauge (I think that was what it was, there was no instruction booklet). The nasal aspirator is too hard to depress. The brush works fine and is soft enough, and the nail clippers aren't bad. I'd buy those 2 items separate and get a digital ear thermometer -- I've been through 2 digital thermometers and my daughter hates for me to take her temp under her ""wing."" You can use your own nail files and tweezers and a comb was unnecessary."
3,It actually is useful,"My son is three and I STILL use these nail clippers. They have always worked well for us. I too use an ear thermometer or a temporal artery thermometer, but I do use the thermometer to test the bath water and it works great for that. I have also used the aspirator and the brush. No, most of the items are not neccissary, but its a nice kit to have. And for the ladies who keep insisting everyone should get everything from the hospital, some of us don't deliver our babies in hospitals. We are not sick and neither are our babies and we don't feel the need to make birth a medical event. I have my babies naturally, at home with midwives and yes, buy my own aspirator and baby brush. I guess I had to sacrifice those ""freebies"""
2,"Cute, but not what you really need.","I have to admit when my cousin and I first saw this in the store we both wanted it. It looks nice because everything matches. But then we started to really look at what is in there. Yes we both agreed that you need a blub, but then with both of our children we received them at the hospital. The tooth brush is not the type you would use for a newborn/infant. Medicine dropers and spoons...again if your baby needs meds you receive a despenser. My cousin then pointed out the water temp. gauge. I looked at her and asked if there was something wrong with her elbow. Point taken and we moved on to the digital thermometer. She stated that the ones she has had have never lasted that long. So yes it looks nice and comes all together, but when we got down to it it didn't have what we really needed or wanted."
2,"Disappointing, really.","The topic and the story line are really compelling--there's so much potential. The note on the cover that it's an Irish Bestseller sets readers up with very high expectations. For me, though, the storytelling was bland: not enough vivid description to really put me there (and there's SO much opportunity for this, what with the contrast between the open and wild western part of Ireland and stuffy, confined Dublin) and a lot of awkward dialogue (with a great many exclamation points!) makes the characters seem stilted. There are quite a few moments where things are repeated, or explained so similarly to other things that much of the story's potential momentum is lost. I'm glad I read it, for the topic, but I was hoping for a better experience."
2,Effective BirthControl for Teenagers,"A lot of feeling sorry for yourself in this book and no redeemable characters. Society was a lot harder on teenager pregancy 50 years ago, especially in Ireland. The nuns provided a home for these girls and I'm sure the nuns didn't live so much better than the girls themselves. This wasn't 1990s America. I guess I'm not such a fan of having teenagers ""bring their babies to school every day"" and ""playing parents"" as is accepted today."
4,great for work or semi-casual work,"I work in construction and need to go from the field to the office. These pants are great for that. I like them better than Dickies (although I have those, too) because the material feels better and the hand pockets don't 'balloon out' the way Dickies do. Plus, I like the brass snap on the rear pocket, as opposed to the button. I'm a woman, curvy figure, and people have said they look good. I agree with the other reviewer that the legs are on the wide side, but on the plus side it may make them more comfortable if you're kneeling alot."
3,really great pants but...,"i have owned a couple pairs of these pants, and i love them - almost. great quality, but what's the deal with the cut? i am 6 foot 2, 175 lbs, but to get a size that fits around my waist, the legs balloon out like a clown. actually very similar to the carhartt pants i like. i just wish they would make them fit slim through the thighs..."
2,Great quality...Extra large fit.,"Bought these pants in a 30w 30l for my boyfriend. We have purchased Ben Davis brand items before, ie. work apron, vest. The quality is excellent but the fit on the pants was extremely too large. He looked like he was swimming in them, even after ordering his correct size. These pants must be made for larger individuals. We are disappointed that they aren't true to size because they are really nice pants."
1,bad bad bad customer service,The item I received wasn't good.. quality wasn't great..The merchant will not respond to my emails requesting a return label..I will never buy from this company again..
3,Alex Gordon - Small Craft Warnings,"Atmospheric soundscapes with mellow beats--probably the easiest way to describe Alex Gordon's debut SMALL CRAFT WARNINGS. ""Eternity"" sets the stage for the rest of the album to follow--soothing electronics, loping rhythm. ""New Love"" introduces some calm guitars into the mix, while ""Never"" inserts a dash of harsher tones and ""Stealing Seven"" has some odd whirring--nothing that'll have you ripping off your headphones in pain, mind you. ""Ether"" enters pure ambience and the title track drifts and pulls like the tides. No need for warnings here: it's smooth sailing almost all the way through."
2,Not very good CD,"Somehow, the direction of this music failed as the group does not mesh in their harmony. II would not recommend."
1,humorously horrible,"This album is so wretched it made me laugh. In the store I looked at the artists and the songs and thought it would provide nice holiday music. I put it on when I got home and wondered if maybe Spike Jones had slipped in some joke tunes. I can't believe these people sound so bad. Sure, some of the numbers are very nice, but then you split a gut laughing at the others--or worse, cringing."
3,a voice teacher and early music fan,"FOUR FOR THE PRICE OF ONE; BUT WHO NEEDS IT!?Herein we have four skilled vocalists who by themselves are most enjoyable, especially Brightman and Domingo. But together singing songs that are wildly different as are their voices is just painful.Of course, we all know the reason: the commercial money-making powers that be are interested only in doing just that. And their logic we know is that four will sell better than one. NOT ALWAYS TRUE!!!!In fact, there are no two voices on this disc that blend well and somehow the Christmas Medley mixing 'Child in a Manger' with 'Santa Claus is coming to Town' I find downright offensive.Buy it if you must,but I am certain that each of these singers have individual discs that are much more flattering to their voices."
2,Not pleasant.,"After unsuccessfully trying to enjoy this CD over the past several years, I finally decided to throw it in the trash -- and write a review to share with you all. This may have been enjoyable as a simple TV variety show, but it's unpleasant to listen to as a CD. The vocalists have such different styles and degrees of quality, that they don't belong on the same CD. The different types of songs are jarring when put on the same CD. The pairing of some of these vocalists with some of these songs is downright unpleasant. The orchestra music is simplistic, non-nuanced, and does not stand on its own; it is simply at the service of the vocalists, with songs generally starting with the briefest of orchestral introductions before some vocalist starts belting out the words. I give it 2 stars, because the title still gives me a warm, fuzzy feeling -- I LOVE the idea of Christmas in Vienna!"
5,The best,Simply the best Micro jack to RCA cord their is. I DJ and this cord holds up well to plugging in and unplugging frequently. Have used one for over two years and it's still sounding great!
4,A great documentary,"This edition of the High Times Cannabis Cup DVD is much more of a documentary style video than the one made in 2003 which contained a lot of strange outtakes. The overall quality is also much better and this is a very well made and entertaining video as well. Good commentary from the select cast about the behind the scenes of the event and about some of the culture of Amsterdam, as well as some stories of their experiences in the city during their visit. It goes inside the coffee shops, gets into some of the politics of the event and gives a good in depth look at how it all works. Overall a really well made film and would definitely reccomend."
5,Good Business,The product arrived on time and in the condition described. There were no issues with this transaction.
1,Gross and not scary in the least.,"Giant, indestructable, maneating crabs move into a loch and begin tearing apart the tourists. Guy N. Smith is a terrible writer and this is a terrible book. Gross and so badly written it reads as a parody of the genre Smith is so crassly exploiting."
1,HORRIBLE PRODUCT!!!,This would be rated 0 but the lowest allowed by Amazon is 1. Product leaves a film on the CD no matter how much you wipe. I tried cleaning with water after using this product and it still will not come off. It's unbelievable that Memorex promotes this as a CD/DVD cleaner. It may work on optical lenses but do not use it on CDs. I sell music for a living so I am very aware of how to care for CDs. This product has ruined numerous CDs for me and I can't express to you enough about staying clear. I have never written a review on Amazon before but I felt obligated to let you know of my experience.
4,Great Goddess,"This is the most sensual cookbook I have read, turning what is to some a mundane satisfaction of a body's need into a near erotic experience - - where else is creme patissiere called ""...utter, smooth voluptuousness...""The short comings I note are the insistance on using self rising flour and an absence of subjective descriptions of what the end point of a product should be. Again back to the creme patissiere, why not tell me it should be thickened to the consistency of_______, rather than ""...utter, smooth voluptuousness..."". Had I not seen this made by my dear old Mum I may not have had a lovely Boston Creme Pie, but rather a runny trifle on a cake stand."
5,This Is It!,"Do you want to experience accomplishments in the kitchen you didn't think you could achieve...Are you tired of run of the mill sugar laden recipes...Are you tired of buying cookbooks that end up forever on the shelf after one recipe is made...Do you want your friends to say ""Wow, this is delicious, where did you buy it?""...Do you want recipies that are so good you really can't wait to make the next one...this book, without a doubt, Is The One! I've had it for about 2 weeks now and I've made 4 items already...I haven't baked this much in years!! My first choice was the Marzipan Fruit Cake - let me just say -this ain't your grandma's fruitcake!! Buy this book - it is worth every cent!!!!"
4,"Nice recipes, although I won't make them all","Interesting book about baking (although what baking and being a domestic goddess have to do with each other, I'm not sure). Great pix, and I must disagree with some of the other reviewers: the recipes are pretty easy to follow.Maybe I'm just cynical, but does anyone really think that married-to-a-billionaire-Nigella has made all of these recipes? Just saying..."
2,Disappointed,"Ok, I'll give this book a five star rating for pictures and style. But the two star rating is for the recipes I've tried to date...the culmination being the ""Snickerdoodles."" I've made snickerdoodles for 25 years and thought it would be fun to try a different recipe. These were the worst cookies I've ever made! Wasted a sunday aftenoon. I'll keep trying to come up with some favorites from the book, but so far, it's none too promising. Are these really her favorite recipes?"
3,Check yer batter!,"I've been making several recipes from this book and they've turned out, but only because I am a professional cook and knew when something in the ingredients list was ""off"". Primarily, most of the recipes are not sweet enough. I made the banana muffins (so lowfat and moist!) and just added half a cup of brown sugar to the honey the recipe called for. Doubled the sugar in the Snickers muffins.So I suggest you dip in a spoon and try the doughs of the sweet recipes before you go ahead and bake them. It has worked for me.Beware too, of too much salt. 1 tsp in the brown bread is plenty, not the 1T the recipe calls for.Interestingly, a lot of these recipes are better COLD.I still like this book because the pictures and text always make me want to bake them for family and friends..."
1,"So, the American version is ""slightly"" off....","...---British measurements are different from American, etc.THAT explains why the Norwegian Cinnamon Buns are so far off!! I have made cinnamon buns for years, but thought I would try this new version---first of all, the directions say nothing of dissolving the yeast in warm water, and secondly, the proportion of the flour to the liquid is not correct. I have the buns in the refrigerator for the second rising in the morning & am anxious to see how the final product fares, after adding several more cups of flour to get the dough to a reasonable ball shape.So far, I am not impressed at all, and find the ...price high for recipes that are not accurate. Good thing it was a gift--I would not have bought it at all."
1,US vs UK version,How do you tell if you are getting the us or uk version if you're purchasing the book online?
5,a wizards work is never done!,"This book is about a wizard who is a teacher to young wizards. He is looking forward to his summer vacation. He is dreaming of doing things like working in his garden, fish and take LOTS of naps. While on vacation he has many interruptions. First he has to resuce a princess, then lift a curse. Evey time he tries to relax someone needs his help! Will the wizard ever get any rest before school starts back? Read this fun book to find out!The book moved at a fast pace. It will hold the attention of young readers well.We recommed this to children who enjoy fantasty books. This is a good one to start with because it's only 134 and can be read fairly quickly."
5,charming and whimsical,This is really like a series of short stories about one summer in the life of the main character. I loved everything about it.
1,Leaves a greasy feel,"I've used this product for many years, and it has been changed from a nice absorbing lotion to axle grease. Yuck!"
5,Handiest thing ever,"I picked this up at BB&B; on a whim and it quickly became my best friend. It can scrape anything off without damaging the dishes. And the unique shape means that it is perfectly shaped to quickly clean flat surfaces or curved bowls. Truly brilliant. The price here is higher than it was at BB&B;, but they've stopped carrying it. Used it a couple times a week for years with absolutely no wear. When my husband ran it through the garbage disposal and it broke, I almost cried. Now I'm stocking up -- and buying some for my sisters and parents, too.UPDATE -- Just want to add that I have indeed starting giving these as small gift add-ons, and they are always a hit. My brother-in-law is now a huge convert and asks for a new one every Christmas. My sister's old roommate recently contacted me to ask where she could get one now that she doesn't live with my sister anymore ..."
2,chocolate gold???,"The chocolate in this basket was good, but not good enough for the exhorbitant amount it cost me!! I could have easily bought all the fixings and done it up myself for 1/4 the price! I was only getting it as a gift to myself and am glad I didn't pay for it for another, nor would I ever again!"
2,Doesn't work for me,"I have been in the market for a paraben free deoderant and have been using this for 2 months. Now I don't know if the scented version does a better job at masking odour, and I don't think that I sweat or smell any better or worse than the average person, but this product does nothing to deoderize for me. And I'm talking about from whether I do light (common day to day living) to moderate activity (playing outside with my kids), this deoderant just does not work from the moment I put it on to a few hours later. Period. It's as if I didn't apply anything at all. I feel that I've given this product a fair chance by wearing it for 2 months regularly. I wouldn't use this again or recommend this, and I am very disappointed. The only reason I gave it an extra star is at least the container is a #2 recyclable plastic."
4,Works better than other natural deodorants,"Due to allergies, I have to use natural deodorants. Most don't work. This one does. For most days, I apply this only once (although on very hot days, I might need to apply a second time halfway through the day). The product lasts a long time and doesn't sting after shaving. The only downside is that it takes a while for the deodorant to dry. Overall, it works well and is a good value."
1,Waste of $$,"I wanted to try a natural deodorant so I bought this product. After purchasing, I noticed that this deodorant still has aluminum in it just like the name brand deodorants I was trying to avoid (although they call it alum). I wondered, if this stuff is still full of the same nasty substances as regular deodorant, why bother, but since I'd already purchased it, I decided I'd still try the product... and I was very disappointed. The deodorant takes probably 10 minutes to dry after you apply it (which is a big pain!) and then after the product finally dries, it does nothing to prevent sweating or odor at all. You'd get the same results by not wearing any deodorant. Liquid rock is a complete waste of money, it doesn't work and it's not even a healthier product!"
2,Not Impressed,I purchased this deodorant to try a new natural kind but was not impressed at all. The smell was alright but it stayed wet for a long time and didn't really work to keep a little smell at bay. Will not buy again...
3,ehh B.O.,"This deodorant i like that its all natural, plus it doesn't irritate my skin. However it doesn't do its job with lasting long at all. I think it lasts prob 30 min and thats it. I'm on the search for a better all natural deodrant that actually works."
5,"Works as advertised, allows you to sweat naturally without odor","This is great, I even bought one for a friend that doesn't believe in typical deodorants or anti-prespirants. With this, you sweat naturally but you don't smell...perfect! I even sweat less on my forehead, it seems, because I'm not blocking a lot of glands. Try it out!"
4,handy sized edition,"349 pages, dark green boards, published 1931, Wm. Heinemann Ltd., London, Windmill Press. Gold text on spine and front cover, 7 1/2"" high, 5"" wide, fairly small font.A very entertaining look at British society of the 1920s, with both romance and danger."
5,Wonderful Salsa Cookbook!!!,"This author has really lived her recipies! Her wonderful little stories that accompany the recipies help you to visualize how memories are made in the kitchen with the dishes we create.I have not found a single recipie that did not work for me if I followed all of her suggestions. She give so many helpful tips for each stage of the development of the finished dish, it would be impossible to fail!Her cookbooks have been my favorite since I discovered The Salsa Cookbook while living in Arizona. I have since sought out and purchased all of her cookbooks as my family loves mexican cooking.I cannot say enough about this author. I hope you will try any of her cookbooks, for if you do, you will indeed have a true 'fiesta'!"
4,"Good, But Not Great","McManus is a great writer. He really is, but this book fails to live up to some of his earlier work. It just is not as funny as previous works. The stories are either just plain boring, or are just too far out there to really make the story funny. Good writing, but not very great content. I do not mean to scare you away from this book, but rather to just make you aware that the book is not quite of the same quality as the other books. Thats all, get and judge for yourself."
5,Need a Laugh?,"Patrick McManus is the needed boost to your days! Sometimes my husband laughs so hard, he cries! Easy to read humerous short stories with the irony of life served on the side."
4,Happy to see That Lady in Ermine on DVD,"Although this is probably not one of Betty Grable's most popular films, I'm still happy to see it finally released on DVD (it was never on VHS). Like others in the Fox Cinema Archives collection; it's strictly bare bones - no photos, no chapter index, no extras of any kind.The storyline of the film is pretty uneven and it has an odd, almost shorten ending. This is probably due to the original director (Ernst Lubitsch) dying during the production and another director (Otto Preminger) assigned to complete it. According to Turner Classic Movies, whole scenes were cut and whole scenes were added in order to even get the film remotely completed.There's not a heck of a lot of chemistry between Betty and her co-star, Douglas Fairbanks, Jr. but I like the songs and Betty is radiant throughout. Betty fans and Caesar Romero fans will certainly enjoy this film; fans of Ernst Lubitsch will probably disagree with me."
2,Only so-so,"I vaguely remember seeing this as a first run movie ""way back when"" and remembered it as being much better. I recently rewatched it and was disappointed. Betty Grable is as gorgeous as ever and does a good job with what she has to work with but the story is silly and the movie drags. Betty, in a dual role as Angelina, ruling countess of an Italian principality, and her ancestor Francesca, struggles to save her country from a Hungarian invasion. In the process the ghost of Francesca makes the Hungarian leader fall in love with her and, by association, with Angelina. There is the typical Hollywood happy ending even though it defies all logic. I wish I could recommend it higher but it was all I could do to finish."
5,Required reading for any woman whose husband is gay.,This book has made me realize that I am not alone during this most difficult time in my life. It has given my feeelings legitimacy. I also gave this book to my parents when I came out of the closet and told them about my marriage.
5,A Fear that breaks in and won't live,"Fantastic. Really kind of Punk is its execution, but too imaginative to be constrained to genres. YES IT'S FILMED CHEAP, but with care, the Director (rising horror film ""Renaissance man"" Robert Luke-look him up) uses this aesthetic and turns it into the heartbeat of the film. The acting, the sound, the little nostalgic soundtrack (OH HELLO JOHN CARPENTER) have a power that betrays the homegrown feel of this film. and the family actually has a dynamic! Finally not a group of people with one to be murdered and the others to reflect! THANK YOU (UH,INTELLIGENT) TEXAS BLOOD WRITER!!!!!! I won't give the plot away though. Watch it and find out. I'll defintely be the guy who writes about the next film this guy does............way before you lazy fanboys get to it anyway."
3,"Good art, decent story","Moebius's art really carries this book. His pen fills The Incal's world with men and monsters, beauties and grotesques, drama and inanity. His palette is brighter and more saturated than in some of his later work, but still eclectic, with skin tones in yellow, green, blue, and fire-engine red. Moebius channels Duillet in at least one scene, the ""shadow egg,"" but that only enhances the visual narrative. The art provides an outstanding vehicle for Jodorowksy's script, which needs all the help it can get.For example, there's the character Nimbea Super Quinq at the beginning, with her baffling transformation - an utter non sequitur. The Metabaron, a character from another book, puts in an appearance. There's the ""psycho-abdomen,"" which appears to a self-healing water balloon full of ink. The story moves along OK, but but sometimes stumbles under ponderous text.It's a good comic, but you might look elsewhere for greatness.//wiredweird"
3,Pretty Good,"Winning Elections is a compilation of articles that have been assembled by Editor, Ronald Faucheux. As a newcomer to politics I found this book to be especially informative. It is about processes and strategies that campaigns employ. This book, however, is not a beginner's book. It is not about building a campaign, or learning the nuts and bolts of campaigns. It is much more than that. This book is meant to build upon existing skills that successful managers and consultants are doing. In reality, there are not set right orwrong ways to do anything, but this book serves as a platform for idea sharing."
4,Absolute Hilarity,A well put together documentary. If you are a fan of the movie (or comedy in general) you should check this out. A rare find indeed!
3,expecting more drama less cornynesssss,"first of all, the subtitles are ok, but the father of the girl was working to be a president, he never became the president because of his daughter finally was able to come clean to authorities and was able to be heard. Unfortuantely, she dies, but what I think it was really corny about the movie is how the first guy was helping and all of the sudden they became best friends, :?? and second, the singer is definately not supposed to be the main character, she shot him because he didnt like her from the beginning, how come they just clicked, cornnyyyyyy....But whatever, I guess what else you can expect..."
4,ONE AGAIN THE GUEST RAPPERS MAKE THIS ALBUM,"MAGIC IS A GOOD RAPPER, HIS VOICE IS TITE, BUT HE CAN'T CARRY THIS ALBUM BY HIMSELF. C-MURDER IS ON A FEW TRACKS, FIEND AND THE REST OF THE SOULJAS OF NO LIMIT. THE ALBUM IS GOOD..NOT GREAT..BUT GOOD. FOR THE RIGHT PRICE THIS ALBUM IS WORTH PICKING UP. ($12 - $15) AT MOST. BUT IF YOU ARE A COLECTER THEN THIS IS A NO LIMIT MUST. IF YOU DON'T ALREADY KNOW THIS.. FIEND,MAC, AND SOULJA SLIM ARE THE ONLY MC'S THAT CAN CARRY AN ALBUM BY THEM SELVES. THOSE THREE ARE A MUST HAVE FOR SURE.ANYWAY, THIS ALBUM IS GOOD 4/5 STARS."
4,I almost didn't buy this. I would've been sorry,"When I bought this cd, I wanted it, but I didn't REALLY like MAGIC. I listened to it and I didn't really like what I heard of it. Then I got to ""BALL 'TIL WE FALL"" and I LOVED that track. The CD got a lot better the more I heard. Other PHAT tracks are ""WHEN DRAMA CAME"", ""I NEVER"" and ""GIMPIN'"". Get it!"
5,great no limit,"i listened to no limit back in the day, all day.this is def one of the cds that stood out,and ive heard em all.yes it was released when no limit was at its peak so there are alot of features,but anybody who ever listened to any no limit cd knows that theres always mad features all over everything.great cd"
4,Magic sucks and has no flow but c-murder makes this cd tight,"Magic in my opinion is a bad rapper, but the fact that C-murder was in a lot of the songs made it a very decent cd. The best songs are ball til we fall, No limit, Money dont make me and hard times. For a no limit cd 4 tight tracks is pretty good. I give it 4 stars because those 4 tracks are the bomb and I can listen to them over and over and not get tired of them. So get this cd if your a no limit fan, or borrow it from someone and record the good songs on to a tape."
3,Nuttin special,Skys the limit is a average NO LIMIT CD! No dope songs on this CD. The only songz ya can listen to are: No Limit Money Dont Make me Ghetto GodzillaNO LIMIT 4 LIFE!
1,The last cd i would buy if i was buying a cd! Period,HOW CAN YOU BE SO SMOOTH ON THE OTHER NO LIMIT CDS BUT ON YOUR OWN YOU COME OUT SOFT AND WACK.TAKE LONGER ON THE CD AND HAVE TWO OR THREE SOLDIER SONGS WITH A THUMPIN BEAT AND A LOT OF RAPPERS RAPPIN AND YOU WILL SELL A LOT OF COPIESTAKE IT FROM ME THIS TOO SH$RT
1,Been taking this for a few months and NOTHING,"Don't waste your money. I have tried taking this for months and nothing... Just like all the other supplements out there, this one does NOT do anything. It is a waste of money. I took this at the advice of my father but it did nothing for me. I can't believe I spent money on this. Buyer Beware!"
5,It works. No side effects. Great price here on Amazon.,Blood work in June 2012 showed lower than satisfactory levels of progesterone. Accompanying mental fogginess as well late in the day. Dr. provided this same product and dosage. Issue felt completely resolved in less than two months. Blood work done after three months confirmed progesterone values back within normal range. Still cycle 100mg of Pregnenolone as a proactive measure.Great price here and fine product from Life Extension.
3,do not buy suplements from this site. you will end up with enormouse postage.,"I ordered 2 bottles because I thought it was a good price , but ended up paying postage separately for each bottle. so I ended up paying more for the product. On the usual supplement sites of the net one can order a load of supplements with only one postage charged. this will be the last time, for me, to make such a mistake and order supplements from an Amazon store. They should worn you before you finalize the order."
3,Good for the casual traveler,"For someone traveling to Uzbekistan, this novel offers a nice glimpse of the country to people who are about to embark on a trip to this region and want an idea of what to expect. I would highly recommend The Opportunists by Yohann de Silva, a fiction/thriller that quite accurate captures modern day Uzbekistan (and its an entertaining read). Here's a link:The Opportunists: A NovelI think the 1 star older review of this novel was unwarranted. The great majority of people would disagree with Olamgir Razzoq's customer review that the economy in Uzbekistan, and the lives of the everyday people, are improving. I worked in Uzbekistan for two years (very recently) and can say for a fact that this is not the case. Inflation and unemployment is very high, and the economy is stagnant."
5,"Great tape, I love it, it can work for you!","At first I had a difficult time with the speakers accent. As I listened and learned to tune into his voice, I became enchanted and renewed by the information and I must say my life has drastically changed from using this tape!"
2,a lot of mumbo-jumbo,"Not a bad book. An easy read to keep on the nightable. It's pleasant enough,but it is basically just homogenized eastern philosophies.Most of the contents are just nice ideas/philosophies not supported by facts. There are some good points, and there are some ""pearls"" of wisdom, but this book is three quarters filler. I would prefer something by the Dalai Lama or Thresholds of the Mind by Bill Harris. The former for wll thought out answers to questions, the latter for a practical program for dealing with life's stresses."
4,always love Deepak,"I love to listen to Deepak Chopra, not so much as to what he says, but for the mere sound of his voice. I always get something to enhance my life from a book or CD. In this CD, I knew much of what he was talking about from previous books. However, I did get some new perspectives and this makes me happy. Often, if I am restless at night or wake up for some reason or another, I listen to Deepak and invariably go back to dreamland. I think that people who accuse Deepak of quackery really miss the point."
5,7 Spiritual laws,This is the same wheel. However enough mud and crap has been removed that one can actually see what it is. Thanks Mr. Chopra for cleaning up the tires so nicely.
5,inspiring,"This book has many benefits- I use it when I am feel I need a different perspective or a reminder. It is full of compassionate wisdom. I recommend it for anyone, any age. ;)"
4,Wisdom in simplicity,"Mr Chopra writes a very easy to understand guide that works for the beginner as well as advance students of enlightment, proving once again to keep your life simple and creative."
1,Rubbish indeed,Thought I'd give this guy Chopra a try. Cliche after cliche. This is the kind of advice rich guys give to the peasants. Somebody came to the states and made a fortune with new age double talk. Nice work if you can find it. Got to admire Chopra's gall.
1,New Age Drivel by Deepak,"Deepak Chopra's The Seven Spiritual Laws of Success is proof that the more you dumb down (and thus distort) Eastern spirituality, making it palatable for the clueless masses, the more books you can sell. Chopra has the formula down pat--reducing real Spirit-communion to ""psychologized"" feel-good mumbo-jumbo tied together with the ever-marketable concept of ""success.""The seven spiritual ""laws"" of success that Chopra identifies are hardly immutable universal laws; they are merely his idea of what produces ""success."" When Thomas Edison was asked the secret to success, he replied, ""1% inspiration and 99% perspiration."" If Edison were alive today, and someone asked him the key to success in the New Age spiritual market, he'd probably observe the popularity of Eckhart Tolle and Deepak Chopra and reduce it to one law: Get Oprah to push your teaching."
4,Wonderful read,Great read so far if you are into self help books and you may have to read certain parts more than once so you get it.
4,a nice introduction,"For the last two decades, I read a lot of books, and met a lot of spiritual teachers. In fact I have ""unlearned"" a number of things by meeting them. Step by step I lost of a number of beliefs till I noticed that there is nothing left, including the seeker who hoped to become enlightened some day. Finally I saw that the clear presence that we are has never been away.Tony Parsons was my final teacher - if I can use such a description. But before I was ready to read Tony's books, I was ""prepared"" by other authors who write about this subject in a more popular way. Deepak Chopra is one of them, and I must say that his ""7 laws"" were one of my favourite presents to friends for a long time. Highly recommended.Jan Kersschot, author of the book ""Nobody Home"""
3,worth reading,"Go ahead and read it, it won't take much time (its very short).I read this after reading Wayne Dyer's ""Manifest Your Destiny"". They are almost identical but Dyer's book elaborates a bit more. I liked them both and feel like the ""Laws"" are very much in keeping with the Bible and the Christian teachings that I've grown up with. Both of these books are like the Reader's Digest Condensed Version of the golden rule. Everybody needs to be reminded of it now and then."
4,The Seven Spiritual Laws of Success,The Seven Spiritual Laws of Success: A Practical Guide to the Fulfillment of Your Dreams (based on Creating Affluence)by Deepak ChopraI am amazed by the insight that Deepak has about life. He writes books faster than I can read them. If you read one you will want to read all of his books to gain insight on a spiritual level.
5,My soul guide,"When I read this book, I realised that Deepak Chopra is the guru I have been waiting for. It is simply superb!"
1,Master BS,"It is easy to write something complicated and convoluted that sends vague messages that can be interpreted in many ways. It is hard to write something clear that immediately makes sense. This book reads as some mystical words of wisdom, but in reality it is a collection of vague nonsensical statements - many of which do not pass the test of reality.Do not waste your money for this book. If I could, I would have returned it, but unfortunately by the time I started to read it, it was pass the seven day Amazon refund limit for Kindle books."
4,Getting better results in life.,"We are 4 people who have bought the book. We read one chapter each week before we meet and discuss what we have experienced during the reading of the chapter. The learning and the interesting thing is to se how different our experiences are. This goes for both the feelings and the meaning. In this way our awareness is developed. This gives us better understanding of our interaction with people and things happening around us.For the last 6 years I have started many groups doing this with different books . I have also done it with my own book "" Getting the best return"". I got the idea from Bob Proctor in Life Success. He call it Master mind groups. The first book I used was ""Think and grow rich"" av Napoleon Hill. That is one of my favorit books when it comes to personal development. Chopras book is very interesting and gives us an even better understanding of ourself. If you like to develop your mind, try it. It is cheap and can give very good results.Carerra"
4,Clear and concise view of the spirituality of men,"The Seven Spiritual Laws of Success goes over the basic rules you need to follow in order to achive a spiritual balance. According to Chopra, reaching this balance will allow you to get anything you want from life: health, money, happiness, etc.The book is short and very simple to read. I only wish he had expanded the implementation of each of the rules a little bit more.Other than that, it's an excelent book."
5,Great lessons!,"This book is a more specific teaching that has assisted me greatly. As in most things in life, finding the discipline to incorporate the teachings takes a little changing of old habits. Love this book!"
4,Quick Inspirational Read,"Good quick read.Good book to have as a reference book. Deepack takes you very briefly over what he calls Seven Spiritual Laws of Success. The very first step covers the ability to meditate,which is to get in touch with your true self and not your ego-show off self. This i found to be the major step in the book, because without mastering it you can not advance to the next steps. So i found myself highly interested into the meditation subject,all of a sudden."
1,Worthless tripe,Chopra is a master of nice-sounding feel-good rhetoric that means absolutely nothing. He paints a bright picture of the universe and tells people things they like hearing--which goes a long way toward explaining his success--but when all is said and done Chopra has done little more than make tons of completely unsupported claims.
5,Excellent,"This book is wonderfully written and filled with wisdom, insight and guidance. I look forward to reading more of Deepak Chopra's books."
5,Keep this book with you at all times,I absolutely love this book. It can be read in an hour but I have been re-reading it for months now.
5,Short and sweet!,The fundamental for any and all Buddhist / Psychology book collections. If you could own just one book by Deepak - this should probably be it!
4,Good book,"The book was excellent. However, I found it very short. I bought it as a kindle version. A general note it was not an abridged version."
3,Good but could have been better,The concept is there. The theological underpinnings are there. But it just seemed to be lacking substance and explanation. I think he would do well to hire a good writer to help him. I think he has a valuable message. I had to think hard about this and read it several times just to understand it and still I'm not sure I do understand it the way he does. He ranges from credible to wildly assuming.
1,Mega flaw in Mega Best Seller,"There is a huge flaw in this book. Below is a quote:""When you make any choice...ask yourself two things: First of all, what are the consequences of this choice that I'm making? In your heart you will immediately know what these are. Secondly, will this choice that I'm making now bring happiness to me and to those around me? If the answer is yes, then go ahead with that choice. If the answer is no, if that choice will bring distress either to you or to those around you, then don't make that choice. It's as simple as that.""If you follow this advice you would stall any sort of personal growth. Deepak is a great man, and has helped many people, but, if you are interested in consicous choice making, then you can know that this book will not help you, and choose not to buy it."
5,7 laws 7 thoughts that have crossed your mind :the answer,"Excellent book! It manages all those thoughts and questions that run through your mind on a daily basis. Like should I be selfish? When to give importance to a certain issue and when not to....What does one do with frustrated feelings....should you show happiness all the time. Each person should have good intentions within but in some situations or certain day, you get fed up.This book helps you not to despair and channel the good in you into unwasted way. A must for every individual to get in contact with his/her feelings and take them out in the right way at the right time, as no one knows you as one knows onself."
5,There is a reason for everything,"I stumbled on this book last week during a difficult time in my life..was almost starting to question the existance of God..This book provided me with explanations, reasons, reassurance, and belief at a time I needed it most. I suggest enjoying the book and learning from it in what ever way u choose"
4,impactful,This book is a classic. It gives so much information on the universal truths from the Veda. Sometimes difficult. I missed the link with the practical world. It is not an Absolute Victory by Pino who brings all of this knowledge steps further. The spiritual laws is a book to have for everybody who wants to complete spiritual and self help literature.
4,The Seven Spiritual Laws of Success,"Eventhough the book is very short, its content is excellent. I recommend this book for anyone who wants self improvement."
5,I give this book as a gift as often as I can!,"I found this book in a book sale at my local library. I had always heard of Deepak but for most of my life was wary of what I considered ""New Age"" philosophy, thinking it too simple. But this book has some very good ideas that can't hurt to believe in and can inspire us to change for the better - to evolve. I have had enough experiences with ""coincidences"" to know that Deepak is on to something. And the more I clue into them, the more they seem to happen. I am not saying I am GOOD at following these laws, but I believe I suffer when I don't. My favorite law is that we are all unique and have something we do better than anyone else in the world. I love telling that one to people - their eyes usually light up at the remembrance of it. Deepak knows he is not saying anything knew, but giving us gentle reminders of what we already know, deep down in our Souls. What a wonderful man and gentle Soul. Thanks, Deepak, for this perfect little book."
5,Undeniable,"Deepak Chopra has always written books that are insiteful, motivational, spiritual, and educational. Now he has summarized his teachings into a practical and easy to understand 7 step formula for a better you. Follow these steps and the results will be swift and undeniable."
5,Excellent Service,I ordered the Seven Spiritual Laws of Success in a rush. I signed up for a class with this book at its base and the class was about to begin. My book arrived the day before the class AND the book was in perfect shape and about a quarter of its original price.Sarah
5,Be Cause,This book helps us understand that we are the cause of all we experience. We choose to respond to life's experiences by the thoughts and feelings we have about them. This book is a guide to help us stay on course. And it shows us how to apply the laws of life with practical examples.
4,A Classic,"I was introduced to this book at age 16, and only read half of it before I had to give it back a year later (it was borrowed). I knew I was reading something very powerful, but the reason I didn't finish reading it is because I found it to be a hard read at the time. I thought I would pick it up again when I had a little more life and educational experience behind me. So I decided to order it after I noticed it on a shelf in a book store a couple of months ago. I realize now that the way the author words his sentences is what makes this book a hard read in certain passages. However, now that I have read the book, my only regret is that I didn't finish reading it earlier. It isn't the only book one should read on success, but the principles in this book will generate residuals for a lifetime."
5,A Banquet with Deepak,"Deepak generously shares his wealth of knowledge,...again,in this ""little book of secrets"" that share with all of us ""The Seven Spiritual Laws of Success"", A Practical Guide To The Fulfillment of Your Dreams.Deepak's ""secrets"" reveal that... 1) Pure Potentiality-everything is available to us 2)Giving-there is an endless supply and we may use everything and at the same time give everything to others 3)Karma-realizing that the universe remembers everything and never forgets and responds with rewards and consequences 4)The Law of Least Effort-go with the flow 5)Intention and Desire-releasing your thoughts to the universe 6)Law of Detachment-herein lies our peace 7)Dharma - joy in beingDeepak always offers""food for thought""...the table is set and you are invited to dine,please RSVP...the universe is waiting for your reply!I hope you enjoy the banquet!"
1,"Not for me, but maybe for other spiritual seekers","I personally didn't care for the redundance of the writings. The reading didn't flow well. Did not work for me, however other people do enjoy his writings, so don't take my word for it. I did not find it inspiring or educational to help with self improvement> I enjoy books that are uplifting, inspiring, and how to change yourself to improve your outlook, thought processes, etc."
5,Very helpful to manage stress,"A few years back I had a heart attack. When I asked the doctor what the most effective things I could do to live a prolonged and happy life in the future, he recommended three things: Eat right, Exercise, and Learn to manage stress.While eating right and exercising are merely choices that one either decides to do or not, learning to manage stress is much more difficult. That's where The Seven Spiritual Laws of Success came to the fore-front. I have found the Laws to be on target and an immense help in both learning to manage stress as well as in enjoying life to the fullest.As a side note, I am a born again Christian. While my beliefs deviate from Deepak's in a couple of areas, for the most part, I found these Laws to be pretty consistent with the teachings of Christ... particularly as laid out in the 'Sermon on the Mount' found in Matthew 5 thru 7."
3,"Distillation of ancient wisdom, but expensive for what it is....","I don't argue that this book contains a lot of wisdom, it most certainly does and it's a good introduction for Westerners to some important Eastern ideas. That is not to say these same principles aren't at work in Western thought, but it's more a question of emphasis.This is a very inspiring, optimistic and simple read. It is not packed with any dense material, however, it contain pearls of wisdom that have practical application for leading a better life.Other people have covered the specific topics, so I won't revisit that territory. I also don't want to knock the content, but I would lean toward a used copy given the price of the book. On the other hand, the principles inside are priceless, but you can also find them in many other places besides Deepak Chopra's books."
4,I have to finish reading,So far I have enjoyed what I have read and I hope to indulge in it some more to really reap the rewards.
5,"Inspiring, Enlightening","I read this book in a few hours, shuffuling errands and laundry in between. It is my first Deepak Chopra read but certainly it won't be my last. At last I've found the inspiration I've been searching for this year."
5,This simple little book can help in a big way bring joy and love into your life.,Each day there is a law one can contemplate and apply to one's life. Take time each day to meditate and experience a new way of thinking and feeling. Joy and peace will follow.
5,Chopra does it again,Deepak again succeeds in letting the reader know how to tap into and cultivate our precious gift of spirituality. Hes brilliant and enlightened. Highly recommended read and practice it as much as you can.
1,"Yeah, right","As an (Asian) Indian in the Computer field I wonder if I am in the right profession. How much easier it is for me to just don saffron robes and/or spout meaningless drivel. I can make much more that way within a year than a lifetime of programming. This author has done just that. In one of his books (he is an MD) he waxes eloquent about happy molecules versus sad molecules.Leave all this nonsense, new age mumbo-jumbo. Go back and remove the dust off the Bible. Read it and live its teachings."
4,Spiritual Laws Made Simple,"Chopra has managed once again to bring a lot of Eastern Philosophy to the West in a simple,direct way.He makes it easier to follow these principles in our everyday lives.Spirituality is everyday living and this book allows us to practice that.Thank you, Chopra for these insights.Radha Singh: Author of ""Wisdom From The Heart"" and "" Xandria"""
4,"Shut Up Brain, or I'll Poke You with a Q-tip","As a fan of the Simpson's and Uno, this game was a great find. Compared to some of the other versions of Uno available, Star Trek for example, Simpson's Uno falls short. The cards feature all your favorite characters, but they only replicate the original game. The other versions offer unique twists not found with Simpson's Uno. To liven up the game, say ""D'oh"" every time you don't have a card."
3,Leaking water bowl,"I bought the fresh flow for my cat after she had a UTI and up til now, 18 months later it was good. Now it is leaking with no abuse, cracks, or damage. I was glad to see other people had the same problem, but after only 18 months this plastic bowl should not leak especially when we were taking care of it."
2,Good for a short while...,"I've gone through two of these fountains already, and each time the pump died after only three or four months. While it worked, I had no complaints - it was very easy to disassemble and clean, and the flow of water was acceptable. However, given how quickly the pumps seem to die, I've since gone to the Drinkwell Fountain with far better results. I highly recommend the Drinkwell over the Petmate."
5,Phenomenal!,"I cannot believe how great Portishead sounds on this live album. I normally *hate* live albums, but this one is in constant rotation on my cd player. I LOVE it. If you are to own any Portishead, it is imperative that this be a part of your collection."
5,It can't be done better...,"If you like the other Portishead albums, this is a must for for you. It's so smooth...."
3,help,"A song by portishead called flowers bloom. I love it, but I can't find anything about it or what album it was on or any lyrics, which I want. Someone has to know something!!!"
5,Awesum,"This rocks. Anybody who compares Beth Gibbons style to Geddy Lee of Rush probably only listened to sound bites of both. Beth's voice is much more complex, and her use of minor keys really gives her songs an edge. Perfect for tuning out the world for hours on end.The best way that I could rate this album would be by agreeing with the other reviewers that recommend not skipping any tracks - this is one of very few that I would listen to any of the tracks with equal anticipation. One of the few that I would not mind accidentally programming the player to repeat one track infinitely (and not noticing for several hours)."
5,What arrangements!,Brilliant arrangements making you wish you were there in person. I recommend the video as well. Beth has the sexiest voice despite chain smoking.
5,Very good!,"Live albums tend to disappoint with crowd noise in the background and mediocre sound. On ""Roseland,"" Portishead recreates their album sound, and yet they give their music subtle twists and turns that make this live album stand on its own. Very well done and original."
4,i think this is better than good,"30 June 1999. You should get this just because the cover is**** weird, the video is not from this planet and tracks 3,4 and 5 are the best songs in the world. P.s. I've never heard P before but now I think I like them."
3,"Very good, but not very complete",I like this live performance very much. But is is not complete. I have seen the concert on tv and they play a lot more songs. On the cd there are also some songs from a year ago (also live in NYC). The '98 versions are better.
4,Pretty good spacer tales,"Good hard SF. Reasonable characters, interesting setting & background. I like the way the various characters wend their way through the technology that surrounds them without really understanding it. It gives a goods sense of the confusion that they are feeling.Well done series and I have read them all. Recommended."
4,Excellent Sequel,I picked this up after reading Neptune Crossing. I was not disappointed. The author weaves a great plotline given the new background and characters. The authors makes these divertent characters work well in a well-rounded plot. The ending comes on suddenly but convincingly.
2,Adventures in Outer Space... or something.,"Background: I came to the book because I was interested in reading Sunborn, the fourth installment in the series, and wanted to get the backstory first. Crossing Neptune was interesting enough to get me to pick up Strange Attractors, but unfortunately I couldn't make heads or tails of the book. I gave up after about 100 pages.The characters just aren't that interesting, and their motivation, to keep moving so as not to be eaten by the mysterious boojum -- no joke -- just couldn't persuade me to stick with the story. There are too many good books in the world to read."
1,Nauseating,"After having read this sugary gunk, I feel nauseaus and sick and would like to puke in the toilet. I apologize for this not being a ""glowing"" review. Maybe this review will inspire Ms. Maguire to focus less on her narcisstic attitude, so that she can focus on the important things: to read and learn from the professional pros who write prose that stays in one's soul long after you have closed their books and not make you feel sick to your stomach with such childish, pathetic, and silly writing as displayed in this book. An ample serving of a writing course might do this ""author"" some good!"
4,I would definitely recommend this product. I have ...,"I would definitely recommend this product. I have used the solid crystal deodorant before, and this liquid option not only worked MUCH better, but was easier to use. True to its claim, the product worked all day long even with a long run at the end of the day. It also did not mark up my black shirts like some deodorants will if you are not careful when you get dressed. The only difficulty I had with the product was in the application. While much, MUCH easier to use than the solid crystal, it took me a couple days to figure out how to not apply too much. I was VERY impressed by its effectiveness."
3,"If you like roll-on deodorants, Kiss My Face ...","If you like roll-on deodorants, Kiss My Face will keep you dry under normal conditions. It dries pretty quickly after being applied. You will need to apply it more then once under heavy conditions to keep dry, though. I would recommend it to a friend."
2,I wasn't very pleased with this product. I ...,"I wasn't very pleased with this product. I have not used a roll-on deodorant in years because I always found them to be too wet, which is the same problem I had with this one. It goes on very wet and remains wet for a long time. Then, when you start to perspire, it gets wet again. It didn't keep me from perspiring, either. It doesn't even have a nice scent. I really think I will stick to a stick. Thanks."
4,simple fun ideas,"The young children the title refers to is more in the K - 1 age rather than preschool, though there is plenty in the book to use with preschool children.Many simple fun ideas."
5,the wonder of childhood,This book contains photos of children(both boys and girls) in the greater London area.The photos were taken between the mid-1950's and the mid-1960's.However it does not appear to be a random selection of photos because most of the photos are of girls in the pre-puberty years in an urban setting.There are a few in parks.Very few near rivers and lakes.Most of the girls are fully clothed with a few nudes(done tastefully in a park setting) toward the back of the book.If you love photography I believe you would enjoy this book.
3,Predictable,"Too predictable for my taste. Too much focus on the crazies.Okay read if you've got nothing better. I will try one more of her books, hopefully with better luck."
3,A Good Into to Mantel,"Hilary Mantel is an amazing writer. No more proof needed than ""Wolf Hall"" and ""Bring Up the Bodies"", both of which got her the Man Booker Prize. I decided to read all of her earlier work and this was where I started. One of the things is that, if you can manage it, read her books aloud. Or maybe purchase audio editions, because the vocabulary sings and her work has a pace that is mesmerising. I recommend."
2,Must be missing something.,"Hilary Mantel is a queen of that very subtle British dark humor that Americans just don't get as well. I wouldn't have thought of this book as humorous if I hadn't been primed by the reviews to think so. It's an entertaining story of characters in a small town who are tied together through interactions in their daily lives. The overall theme questions the idea of what constitutes madness. Unfortunately, the plot just kind of petered out. I doubt I would read another of her books."
3,HUH?,"Don't think you need to read the first book (Every Day is Mothers' Day) to fully understand the happenings in this book. The author literally spends the first quarter of this book rehashing it.I preferred this first book to this one. Why? It had an acutal ending. This one just ends. Don't get me wrong, lots of events are taking place, but it just stops and there is no conclusion. I'm not sure if Hilary Matel is a brilliant writer, or just lazy.Maybe there is a third book to come? Highly doubt it, but maybe that's where she was headed."
2,Go on instinct or stick to a diet?,"I ate an RVAF diet very similar to the one Ano (aka Zepher) advocates and got into a tremendous mess with parasites, heavy metals, bacteria and all the fun that follows that. Save yourself the trouble. Just go to Mexico and get some of the lovely venganza de Moctezuma instead. You'll have plenty of diarrhea and end up on antibiotics either way though. Raw food diets are ridiculous and this one is no exception. They're all based on the false premise that parasites (of all kinds) either don't exist, are harmless or even beneficial. I found out the hard way that this is wishful thinking. But don't take my word for it. The medical cartel is ready to cash in on your misery when you end up on Flagyl or whatever. Peace"
3,The lotion was fine. It made my skin ...,"The lotion was fine. It made my skin very soft. It was similar to other items that I've tried, except that it was fragrance free. The men in my family liked it a lot because there was no fragrance. I'd recommend the item."
4,Hull girl Maureen does it again!,"This is one of a number of marvellous books by Maureen Lipman, and it seems she is improving with every one of them. She lets us into her life and allows us to be with her during her daily routine,with some funny and some sad stories, which will both move you to tears and make you laugh, sometimes at the same time! For those of us who have read all of these books she carries on little stories from previous installments, which makes you, as the reader feel she is inviting you to know a little bit more about her, Jack, the kids ( Amy and Adam ) and of course, the wonderful Zelma ( Maureens Mum )."
4,Great book!,"My 28 month old loves this book. It is like an ""I spy Book""for a toddler. It has enough objects and characters that you can askyour child many questions about the book, beyond what is actually written.... END"
3,Hit and Miss...but pretty good.,"Overall, it's a well done tribute to Hiatt with a great roster of artists lending their talents. But, as usual with tribute albums, you quickly realize that nobody does it like the original. Having said that, there are some excellent tracks on this disc:-Patty Griffin's ""Take it Down"" is definitely the standout here....it's almost good enough to rival the original.-Clapton/King's ""Riding With the King""-Emmylou Harris is great on ""Icy Blue Heart""This disc is for the die-hard Hiatt fans who already have all of Hiatt's stuff....new folks should go for ""Slow Turning"" ""Walk On"" or ""..Gruff Exterior"""
4,"A mixed bag, but good overall.",".The album starts badly with Buddy and Julie Miller proving they can't get close to the electrifying original of 'Paper Thin'. The title track is another let down, and Buddy Guy's 'Feels Like Rain' fails to live up to Hiatt's own version. Can't blame them all for trying though.Bonnie Raitt's stonking remake of 'Thing Called Love' is so good you can forgive its inclusion while wishing that more of the album was Hiatt's obscurer songs like Patty Griffin's lovely 'Take it Down' and Roseanne Cash's 'This is the Way We Make a Broken Heart'. Hiatt's well-known songs are well-known because he did such a great version. Trying to improve on them is a waste of time, though Rodney Crowell has a good stab at it on 'She Loves the Jerk'.It's an interesting album for Hiatt fans, but one that will probably have them backtracking to the originals to hear the songs done properly, for the most part."
1,Not worth the money,"I bought the book, read it, and returned it the next day, because it actually had less information than I have found for free on-line.If you are interested in it, look over it in a bookstore before wasting your money."
4,Amazing work,"The only things holding me off from a five star rating on this book are two things; the structure of the book seemed somewhat week, with skips backward and forward in times in manners that were somewhat confusing and tied to this was the overall editing of the book, I felt like it could have been edited down about 50 pages or so. Despite these weaknesses I would highly recommend this book to any person interested in history, sociology or ethnic history. Easy to read and understand and highly engaging."
5,Hard to read despite excellent writer.,"One of the most engaging books I've ever read, I was repulsed by many of the accounts but felt compelled to keep on reading. To me this book is not a rubber-necking excercise but a caution and a blueprint to avoid inhumanity."
5,Too Horrifying to be Ignored,"The appalling genocide in Rwanda in 1994 passed with little notice in the United States or the rest of the West. The fact that thousands of Tutsis were being hunted down and slaughtered by their Hutu neighbors didn't register with most of us until after the worst of the tragedy was over and the piles of bodies began to be buried. This willfull ignorance is ironic because, as Gourevitch makes clear, the massacre was a direct result of Western imperialist policies and interference in the indigenous tribal system of Rwanda.The book is a quick read, not because the subject matter is easy to digest, but because it is so horrifying that it can't be put down or dismissed. I hope this book helps to personalize the horror of Rwanda in 1994 in the same way Anne Frank's diary evokes the Holocaust."
5,A fascinating view into the collective madness of a nation,"A captivating book about the genocides in Rwanda in 1994 and its aftermath. The book was extremely well written with the author's obvious empathy for the people. He was able to look inside the psyche of both the victims and the perpetrators in a situation that can only be described as anarchy. Basically, an entire country went crazy, a psychosis built on a solid foundation of Western influences and prejudices. It really brings home a lot of issues about foreign policy on the world stage and the european/american apathy towards Africa in general. A tremendous read."
3,Confusion,Gourevitch told a story that must be told to the world. I only wish that he had told it as history-in consequential form. The story hopscotches from Biblical times to 1999 in apparently random order.
4,Africa is terrible,"I read this good book, here in Brazil.This book is about the genocide, in Rwanda.Blacks exterminates other blacks, in massive numbers; hundreds of thusands.No religion- animism, christianism or muslin- did something with force to end this genocide.In all times, Africa is terrible."
1,Too biased to contribute anything to our understanding,"Gourevitch's book has a central flaw: it tries to draw a much closer analogy to the Jewish holocaust than the facts actually warrant: the author comes with a module, and appears determined to hammer reality into that module, inevitably casting the Tutsi in the role of the Jews. But the Tutsi are NOT the Jews: they were monarchs, land and cattle owners and pretty consistent abusers of the Hutu peasantry -- which does not explain the genocide, nothing ever could (Gourevitch sure as hell doesn't) The book might have contributed something to our understanding of the genocide had it taken a closer look at power relations between Hutu and Tutsi prior to the Hutu revolution of 1959 rather than limit itself to an outraged chronology of injuries inflicted on the Tutsi."
2,Lacks critical thinking,"The subject matter is powerful, and the author's self-appointed task, that of drawing our attention to the atrocities committed in Rwanda, is an important one. However, I found that the book lacks critical thinking and does not go beyond the surface on an intellectual level. It is a shame, because the subject matter deserves more serious attention than this emotional, and even glossy, treatment."
3,Maddeningly Turgid,"This is a very poorly written book. There is no true sense of organization or central message in the author's writing, which is often so turgid and opaque as to tempt one to give up and move on to another volume. An example (from page 259):""[T]he war about the genocide was truly a postmodern war: a battle between those who believed that because the realities we inhabit are constructs of our imaginations, they are equally true or false, valid or invalid, just or unjust, and those who believed that constructs of reality can--in fact, must--be judged as right or wrong, good or bad.""Despite the author's painfully inadequate communication skills, however, the subject matter of this book is so compelling that one hopes it will be widely read indeed. The undertaking will be painful, however--a little like taking a train trip through breathtaking mountain terrain in a dome car with dirty, frosted windows."
5,Rich with Human interest Stories,"Firstly I must say that Philip is the only western writer who managed to grabb the best picture of what happened in Rwanda. I only managed to read one of his stories from the Mail & Guardian Newspaper and it is like I have read the whole book. It is amazing that when you see Mr Ntaki Rutumana on tv and Photographs, he seem to be a good man but hearing what he did in Rwanda is amazing, especially when it comes from a Reverend. People were killed like chickens slaughtered for a christmas day. Philiph to me is really a good example and role model to all young journalists. I wish to like Philiph one day"
5,Reality? Check!,Have you ever been punched so hard that you forgot who and where you were? The tales Gourevitch brings back from Rawanda will do you just so. I don't know where they'll hit you but they'll hit you so hard that you may never be the same if you choose to read the accounts of the Rawandan massacre...
5,Possibly the most powerful book I have ever read.,"I began reading this book thinking, ""By the end of this book, I should understand why this genocide happened.""No such luck. The author does not let anyone off the hook, and that includes the reader.I absolutely, highly recommend this book. It will move you."
3,Who Edited This Book?,"Gourevitch's book is superbly reported, intellectually challenging, very important, yet remarkably annoying to read. Having struggled half way through ""We Wish.."" I began to wonder if the book had been edited at all. While I appreciate the importance of preserving the immediacy of Gourevitch's observations, I felt that the lack of editorial input ultimately undermined what could be a far greater book. There are some truly horrendous sentences in this text; I really can't understand how these slipped past his editor. Gourevitch also frequently (and lazily) resorts to a series of hackneyed cliches, which do nothing for the story. I often found it difficult to follow his pattern of thought and sometimes his musings made no sense. Perhaps I'm being too harsh. In sum, this is a fine book. But please, when it's republished, edit the thing, and as someone else suggested, include an index!"
4,A stinging indictment of the international community,"I would recommend this book to anyone and everyone. Everyone should know exactly what happened in Rwanda, and this book brings to light how Western governments stood by and watched (even helped) as nearly a million innocent civilians were hacked to death. It sheds at least some light on the question of how/why? It starts out strong, but kind of started to lose me towards the end. Still a good read."
1,pretentious and extremely badly written,"I think this book got the praise it did because the subject matter is so important. However people should not confuse an important subject with important writing. At times the prose in this enoumously self centered book is so staggeringly bad that it's hard to believe it was published. See a reader from Alaska for a sample. However,the author gets kudos for going to Rwanda and making the world more aware of what was going on. But boy, did he need an editor. By the way, he also refers to himself almost constantly-- I mean who cares?"
1,horrable writing style,"First the book brings up an important event a modern genocide. However, the author does a terrible job of writing this book. By the end of the book i found myself unable to sympathize with either party. I would recommend reading this only if you are required for a class but other wise this work is more akin to twilight in its writing level; I mean, even Wikipedia has better writing standards then this! Ultimately it covers a lot, but it's clearly Tutsi biased writing style removes a lot of credibility from this work."
2,"good writing, important subject matter, but what's the point","This is an odd review. I enjoyed reading the book, I found it well documented, well written in the sense that it had an arc to it.The only thing , after about one hundred pages or so, was that I started to wonder why it mattered that I read it? When dealing with events that have just happened, and the ramifications are still extant, isn't it more important to go out and do something about problems then just read about them? I worry that books like these are just for the bourgeois to gape at far away terror, but I read it for school, so I may be biased."
4,Genocide ignored,Gourevitch does a good job of filling in at least some of the gaps in the average reader's - western reader at least - knowledge of Rwanda and its people. Even readers who are fairly savvy and aware of world news can expect to have their understanding of the Rwandan genocide challenged. It is deeply disturbing to know that such things can happen in the world and even when news agencies and international humanitarian groups have observers present not only is nothing done to stop them but they are barely acknowledged.
5,We Wish to Inform you That Tomorrow We Will be killed With Our Families: Stories from Twanda,"I purchased this book for my daughter. She needed to read it for her Honor's English class. She is finding it to be difficult reading. I have read some of it with her. The topic is very interesting and hard to believe. I think the writing is intense and difficult, but necessary for this type of subject. I think in the long run she will have learned a lot about the genocide in Rwanda after finishing the book. By going to a website that had an interview of the author we were able to better understand the subject matter."
4,Good read but get ready to be depressed and/or angry,"The book does a good job of explaining what happened in Rwanda and the author makes a good attempt at trying to understand and explain the reasoning behind the genocide. He makes it very clear that the West was quite hypocritical in its actions (or lack of) and bundled big time. He also does a good job in explaining what happened before and after the massacres, not just the massacres themselves.I also recommend checking out the Frontline show on Rwanda, which just as interesting as this book."
5,Very informative and interesting book,"A great book! This book was easy to read, interesting and informative. Gourevitch was able to explain a very complicated event in an interesting and easy to read book. I highly recommend this book to anybody who wants to understand what happened in Rwanda."
5,"Excellent, Superb , Read IT!","There are no words to describe what a privilege it was to read this book. I think anyone who reads it will afterwards be a different person. I think for the better but certainly with a broadened knowledge of the human experience which he/she will take to the grave. Please if you are reading this review, get the book, and read it. We all have a responsibility to know and I hope learn."
5,Powerful reading,Gourevitch's book is simply powerful reading. And must reading for anyone seeking answers to the tragedy of the Rwandan genocide. You will not be disappointed.
2,Mystery music,"Well, there is music on the two discs in this set, and it's pretty good. The problem is that the liner notes, titles on the discs and the actual music on the discs don't match. I only wanted to rip 4-5 tunes to my library and it took me a long time to figure out where they were and get them because of the mislabeling. Also, according to the Sound Hound app on my iPhone, which I used to help me, the tunes are not all by the orchestras listed on the discs. So, I don't know what I have. If you like Strauss and don't mind figuring it out yourself, get this. Otherwise, there are probably better deals elsewhere."
3,Good price but slow receipt.,The title says it all. The price was good but it took a very long time in arriving. Since it was sent to my son in another state I have no idea what the quality of the book was like.
5,Life Changing,"This book changed my life. I have read many of Joyce Meyer books but this book had the biggest effect on my life. In the book Joyce talks about enjoying the were you are at any moment in your life. She explains that we should enjoy what we have and the present stitution that we are in, and in order to get were we want to go we need to be comfortable with our current stitution. I advise everyone to read this book if you are unhappy with the current state of your life. This book will teach you how to embace what god has giving you at the present time."
2,This is not a good digital recording,There is a 'record player' hum in the background when you try to listen to various tracks on these CDs. The compilation is wonderful. The Quality of the recording is very disappointing. The outside of the album cover reads DDD which I thought to mean clean and clear all digital recording. Don't be deceived by the cover.
1,Well...,"The item is fine, except for the fact that I THOUGHT I was supposed to be getting 4 CDs. I don't like how there's this chance of a fine print where you don't get the whole product. I bought it through a seller, and even though its not technically ""Amazon"", this is the 2nd time I've had problems with this site in the last 2 months. Needless to say I won't be buying anything for awhile.If you want to know how it is, I listened to the 1st cd, (which is the only one I got) and its decent.That's my rant."
3,got what i ordered,I was after Bolero from Ravel - and this came up for $2.98 while searching.cannot complain about the price with free shipping. It arrived quickly.not a great sound - but ok.has 12 tracks (nor Bolero - but 2 others from Ravel)This is NOT a 4 disc set like some one thought!
3,"classics for lovers, in part...","The 2nd volume of the four volume set, CLASSICS FOR LOVERS was received and although the tenor is rather mediocre, marginally adequate, the orchestral and instrumental numbers are excellent. However, the advertisement on Amazon leads one to believe that one is ordering all four discs not just the one. I admit no one can really complain since the price is really only the shipment costs. I would, however, gladly pay more for the discs if all four were included - $4.00 or even more would be a fair price. If such an offer exists, let me know via my e-mail, wkcarter36@yahoo.com. Thanks for your good service in all of my purchases. Will Carter, Los Angeles"
5,Great tunes,I bought this CD in the US a few years ago and lost it on the way. It took me a long time to find a new copy and finally got it back. Good if you are 40 and grew on the 80s and 90s.
2,You're the Inspiration,"Peter Cetera is Chicago singing! If you love the original Chicago sound, you should own and listen many times this excelente CD: you will feel its the very heart of Chicago. I hope amazon.com has it in stock very soon."
2,No ending?,"I would give this movie more than two stars if it actually had an ending. The movie kept my interest but at the end, did not deliver the goods. I don't like to make up my own endings. That is why we have screenwriters."
2,What did I miss?,"Someone actually considered this Oscar material. Okay, I just thought the Coen brothers would pull something out of a hat, considering the hype. But, no - and what I missed was the ending - there was an ending?"
3,Disk made in Mexico?,"On the outside of the DVD package, the Josh Brolin and Tommy Lee Jones' names where in the wrong place. The DVD, ""No country for Old men,"" came in what I consder flimsy packaging. The DVD came in good condition. And it came relativley quick."
2,"Double-dipping, Triple-dipping, Quadro-dipping.... Abominable!!!","How many times could a movie be released on DVDs these days? Probably to no end. Corporate greed will lead this movie from Special Edition, Collector's Edtion, Special Director's Edition, Special Unrated Edition, Definitive Edition, Special Definitive Edition and then if greed still prevails thre should be Special Definitive Collector's Edition.... Corporate fat cats will try their best to grab moneys from your wallet. The movie was pointless and senseless to begin with only redeemed by good actings that the film didn't really deserve........."
3,No Country for Anyone,"Another one of those movies where the production runs out of money and/or time and the director yells ""Cut!"" and the audience is left wondering what the F**k happened......"
1,"Good Title, Bad Movie","Y'all - Bang - Y'all - Bang - All y'all - Bang, bang - Sigh - Y'all - Bang - SighHateful nihilism disguised as art.Not only did I hate the movie, but now I hate the actors for their complicity in this celebration of death."
3,No big deal,"Yes, it was a good movie. But there are a lot of good movies. I don't know what the big fuss was about. A few quirky features like a unique murder weapon, but another psycho killer ho-hum. I wasn't blown away. Josh Brolin was quite good as the protagonist, Tommy Lee Jones' role was rather small but well-played. The best part of the movie was the first 30 minutes. I was wishing he never went back obviously to the crime scene.I thought 3:10 TO YUMA with Crowe & Bale was more riveting and had a better plot than this movie. But some people seem to go crazy over anything by Cormac MacCarthy."
1,Garbage,"This is trash cinema. I'm sure all you ""Saw"" lovers think this is great but then you probably like to get drunk and throw up too."
1,Horrible!,"Why do people keep going to Coen brothers films? This is yet another example why their movies just do not cut it. As always, the movie in stunning in it's technical execution, but the story is lacking. I guess the Coens would ally themselves with the realism school of moviemaking, because there is no STORY here. It is just a moment in time where nothing gets resolved. That said, it is saved by great filmmaking and acting, but it isempty. In the end, it is the story that matters. Since this movie doesn't have one, I give this a one star, the equivalent of cinematic garbage."
1,academy award??? really???,seriously folks this movie won best picture??? maybe I'm from another planet or something because I just watched this movie and THIS MOVIE SUCKS.
1,just awful,"I borrowed this from the library, thank goodness I didn't pay any money to see it because I would have felt ripped off. As it is, I'm sorry I wasted two hours watching it. I loved Fargo, which is why I tried this, but I've never, ever seen a movie as bad as this one. Total piece of garbage. It shouldn't get any stars at all. Seriously bad movie and I can't believe it was even nominated for Academy Awards, let alone win some. Just terrible. Forget it, and watch Fargo again."
2,OVER RATED SnoozeFest,"I dont know what the critical mass thought was so appealing about this movie. Even being such a huge fan of the Coen Brothers, this movie was far from oscar worthy material. It lagged so long, was as PREDICTABLE as they come, and ultimately, STUMBLED where it SHOULD have KICKED you in the face. There's no ""Blood Simple"" here, folks. Masked in contrived subtleties, yet nowhere near as gripping and enjoyable as ""Fargo."" And a complete ""letdown"" of an ending. The actor portraying the killer IS deserving of some praise for his menacing work, but the rest of the cast seemed as if they were being ""dragged"" through this mess like this particular viewer was."
1,Really?,"I have to wonder about the high reviews for this film, I'm wondering about the film, I'm wondering about the story. Some say it was a great production, if so it was wasted on this story. The ending is no ending. It was just one long depressing film of a violent nature."
1,what a lame movie,"This is the dumbest movie I've seen in a long time. I can't fathom what in the world justifies this receiving nominations for anything except maybe directing/cinematography. The protagonist is a completely unbelievable character in his motivations. The plot has no depth to it whatsoever - NOTHING HAPPENS!! - AND IT HAPPENS SO DAMN SLOW!! If all you care about is seeing a string of murders then this is your movie. If all you care about is seeing tommy lee jones rehash every other character he's ever played then this is your movie. If you don't like having any closure or sense of completion to the story then this is your movie. If you think stealing the two-face character from batman by doing the ""coin flip for your life"" bit is original and cool, then this is your movie. Otherwise, move along - I can't get back this time and I can't believe I went along with all the reviews and watched this."
2,This movie murders the word entertainment,"Should you find yourself strapped to a chair, immobile, without a remote to turn off this movie, then you have no choice. Take your punishment. A story of a crazy jackass just shooting at everyone and everything, even a bird. Totally senseless. That's how the movie depicts that this country is no place for old men. This movie is a waste of time and I refuse to spend any more time writing about it."
2,america's critic,"just a mellow yellow movie was boring and quite,, loved the story but was kinda daydreaming when it was playing,,, i liked the airgun thing that was neat this just didnt inpress me with all the award crap--- rent this at the least i wouldnt purchase this one"
2,Best picture???,"To keep this short, this is the worst picture I have ever seen that won the Best Picture Oscar. How can this possibly be compared with ""To Kill A Mockingbird"" or ""Patton""? What a travesty."
2,Worse. Ending. Ever.,Worse. Ending. Ever. How did this win several Oscars? This movie drifts all over the the place like a drunk behind the wheel of a car. Really pointless most of the time. Great movies have a moral message. This movie has no message. Just pointless nihilism.
1,Terrible in every sense of the word. A WASTE!!!,This movie was a waste of movie everything. Boring idiotic and lousy acting. What a lame story. Made no sense. Nothing artistic or entertaining about this garbage.
1,Country for old men,"That was the worst movie we ever started to watch. Half way through the movie, we stopped it and threw it into the garbage. It is getting very hard to find good movies today."
1,Ridiculously overrated film,"Perhaps in an era of corrupt leaders and illegal warfare we don't deserve better films than this, but my hope is that we can begin to rise above our sad appetite for the sort of pointless violence glorified in this movie. No Country for Old Men is easily one of the worst films I've ever seen. It's a predictable (and often boring) epic of graphic killing with a thin plot and even thinner characters. Despite all the hype surrounding this picture, there's nothing redeeming or insightful to be found here. Don't waste your time!"
1,Snooze Fest,"Not sure what all the hype was about, but this movie was a better inducer of sleep than any over the counter sleep aid. Can't believe that Bardem won an academy award for his performance. He was basically a Spanish Terminator. Don't waste your time on this overhyped movie."
1,Over Rated And Certainly Not The Coen Brothers Best,"This movie isn't good and definitely is not a ""masterpiece"" in any sense of the word. It is dark and violent and thin on plot with nothing to redeem it. Scenes are left incomplete and dangling and the movie ends so abruptly I thought for a moment my TV went on the blink!Save your time and money. I like the Coen brothers but this movie bombs in every sense."
5,Great movie,"Great movie. a must see. world class cast, and will make you think twice if some one asks you to call heads or tails."
3,"No, It's Ben Johnson Country","You know you're in trouble when all the male leads are basically doing impressions of Ben Johnson. At least Tommy Lee was authentic enough to know that no real cowboy ever rolls up his sleeves. A detail that Brolin managed to miss; probably got him killed.Don't care how many awards it got, a Texas ""Fargo"" it's not. In a couple of years it'll probably only make heavy rotation on Spike TV's Saturday morning line-up."
3,I could go on for paragrahs------,"Well, I could go on for paragrahs.But--I don't have the skill with the English language that many of the reviewers do. I will tell you that there was to much hype about this movie. It was good. It was not great. Dissecting this movie won't help and it won't make me like the movie any more."
3,awesome movie,Great movie everyone should see this one. my family and i watched it and I think it was a good Christmas present.
3,Needs a good story,"The one outstanding feature of this film is that it did not depend upon a soundtrack. It is a visual masterpiece. However, I really like a good story and the plot did not have enough twists and turns for me. Casting was perfect. I read another review which stated ""not a movie for the masses."" I thought that statement was really elitist. Us average people on the street want to be entertained and we don't mind learning a little something too, but it can't be too subtle. I was slightly entertained and I really didn't get the themes. Hmm...maybe it's because I'm one of the masses who pays money to see these movies."
3,strong cast in a script that's wanting,"It's not easy to critisize filmmakers you respect (have liked Fargo, Blood Simple, Barton Fink, etc.), but this one here could have been something truly great...alas, the story limps along and finally leaves you saying What the hell?One solution may have been to make the film longer, because as it stands there is hardly enough time to tell everyone's tale as it should have been told: three different storylines going simultaneously that finally collide and/or connect to some sort of deneument.All you have to do is take a look at Sergio Leone's masterpiece Once Upon A time In America to get what I am saying here: the short version was choppy and didn't work, the long/director's cut works terrifically and is considered (by many) to be one hell of a motion picture, perhaps even a classic of its kind."
5,Not for the faint of heart,Brutal film that absolutely works and with no fairytale ending it's the reason why this exceptional film has and continues to be praised.
2,"Great Film, Lame Ending","I was sorely disappointed with No Country, and here is why.If you don't want to sit through an intense film that really sucks you in, then leaves you hanging for a conclusion, don't watch this movie. The ""ending"" is not an ending at all. It is a VERY violent, linear film, which left me watching the end credits thinking ""um, so how does the story end?""I would not have been so disappointed had I not really enjoyed the story up until it suddenly stopped with no proper conclusion."
4,No Country for Old Men,I liked this movie a great deal; however it ended abruptly and left you hanging; maybe it plans on a sequel.
2,Get Off Your High Horse,I love all these reviewers who seem to say you need to be a genius to appreciate this movie. Pat yourself on the back much? Get off your high horse.This film is lazy and cheap. The story was a mess. The villain was inconsistent and weak. Seriously overhyped. It's like a bad Tarantino film without the witty dialogue and hipster soundtrack. I really don't feel like writing a full review of such a disappointing film so go ahead and crucify me. You're all such geniuses. I'm sure you're right.If you don't like my review maybe you're just not intelligent enough to appreciate my subtlety.
1,Big disappointment,I was waiting for the academy award winning part of the movie until it was suddenly over... The characters seem dull and the ending is just plain bad.
5,Easily the best of 2007,"The Coen's hit this one way out of the park. Brilliantly directed, acted, and filmed, but obviously not for the dull-witted masses."
5,ENGROSSING STORY FROM BEGINNING TO END!,"This is a ""must see"" film filled with colorful characters and a great cast. 'Javier Bardem' who I am not familiar with proved to be a disturbing and menacing unforgettable force. This film doesn't waste anytime getting to it and it's 2 hour length was time well spent. The violence is sometimes graphic, but there are many violent acts that are implied. One of, if not the best picture I've seen all year. The DVD transfer is excellent and there are some interesting extras."
1,There is No Way to Praise a Movie That Ends Like This,"The ""inconclusiveness of the ending"" which another reviewer praised is exactly why I did not like this movie. I felt like a bad joke had been played. Watch for nearly two hours and then no ending. So many questions left unanswered. The whole point was lost to me. I agree with those who say ""don't watch it"", and ""why did this win?"" However, if they had a catagory for most annoying ending of the year, No Country for Old Men would win, hands down."
1,Worst Movies I have ever seen,This was the worst movie I had ever seen and it doesn't even deserve a star. And I gave it to my neighbor and she said the same thing. This is one movie I will not watch over. I don't know how it even won all of it's awards.
2,This Movie Was So Over Hyped....,"I was so disappointed in this film, as everyone Raved about it. American Gangster ran Rings around this ""attempt"", ten times over. Yes, it was interesting for a brief period, but ran out of gas real soon. Especially the stupid ending. But, to those whom Loved it? More power to you. The acting was Not all that Great either. I would have given this film 1 star, but i enjoyed seeing ""Maurice"" from Nothern Exposure. This movie just proves how Much politics goes into being nominated, and winning an Academy Award. Best film? Hardly. The only thing that made me happy, was that i didnt have to buy it, nor rent it.Save your money, get American Gangster, and see a Real Film worthy of Academy Awards."
3,Not the best from the Coens,"The Coen brothers give us a cinematic bloodbath, but with a message- Old People don't like this sort of thing. People just don't have manners anymore. It used to be that when people killed people in movies, back in the good ol' days when old people were young, they got what was comin' to them. Now we live in a messed up world where serial killers murder people with compressed air canisters, and they don't feel sorry for it.The point of all this on-screen killing is for Old Man Sheriff (Tommy Lee Jones) to philosophize in barely decipherable mumblings how it's all gone down the toilet, and people weren't cruel to each other back in World War 2 and such. Was his character even necessary? He certainly didn't move the plot forward any. I guess the film needed a conscience.There are many similarities with this movie and Fargo. Except Fargo was better, and won less Oscars.""No Country.."" was not the ""best picture"" from that year, though very few Oscar winners ever are."
3,No Country for Old Men with Tommy Lee Jones,"One strange movie but not boring.As a mother/grandmother, I'd lock this one away from the kids."
4,A Flawed Masterpiece From the Coens,"""No Country for Old Men"" is the best Coen Brothers film since ""Fargo."" Based on Cormac McCarthy's novel, this existential modern-day western features knockout performances by Tommy Lee Jones, Josh Brolin and Javier Bardem (a classic villain despite the Beatle haircut). Though excessively violent, the movie provides a disturbing meditation on uncompromised evil within its cat-and-mouse framework. When the Coens go full throttle, the results are exhilarating. However, Joel and Ethan occasionally stumble in their over-faithfulness to McCarthy's source material. Another misstep is the needless subplot involving Woody Harrelson's sharp-dressed bounty hunter. Kelly Macdonald, on the other hand, makes the most of her limited screen time as Brolin's devoted wife. Admittedly not for all tastes, ""No Country for Old Men"" is a flawed masterpiece that defies convention."
1,The Emperor's New Clothes of Cinema.,"This movie is boring, rambling, pointless, and dull. Furthermore, it's badly produced, poorly acted, and incompetently Directed. There's a reason why it tanked at the box office, and the Oscars that featured it was the lowest rated in Oscar history. The reason is this: the movie is pure nonsense from beginning to end. The less said about the ending the better, but it's unbelievable to me that people are actually praising this movie for it's lack of anything resembling professionalism. For those of you that don't know what I'm talking about, the main protagonist is killed off-screen, without any build-up or explanation."
1,One of the WORST movies of ALL time!!!,"This movie had so much hype and looked like it should be a great movie! I can't believe I sat through the whole thing! I just kept telling myself ""oh it will get better this is just the boring begining."" But it just never happened and I now lost 2 hours of my life that I would have rather spent in prison.This is one of those artsy fartsy movies that is so bad that people think it is good. There is no soundtrack at all and most of the time your TV will be silent except for the wind or gravel crunch of someone's shoe as you watch them walk for 5 mins towards a deer.So if you like mild action scenes mixed with a lot of conversations that have absolutly nothing to do with what is going on with the movie, than this is the summer lackluster for you!"
1,Not Good!!,Ok...I saw this at the movies and it was terrible. I felt like I was always trying to catch up and figure out what the point was. Total waste of time!!!
1,Whats the big deal?,No Country for Old Men is by far the worst Coen brothers film. I was very let down by there graffic detalied opening.Only to leave you guessing what happens at the end. I was not familar that David Lynch would direct the last 30min of the movie. It does not deserve the praise that older Coen movies do. For the record I am a fan of the Coen brothers and David Lynch.
2,What the ???,I have to agree with all who were disappointed with this movie. Some things just didn't make a lot of sense to me. If the guy didn't go back to give some dying guy a drink or water then he would have never been caught. What fool who finds 2 million dollars goes back to the scene of the crime??? He deserved everything he got for being so damn stupid.
2,As trite as cynicism could make it.,"Psychosis as an air-borne disease. I looked for the coupon to mail in to get the ending, but there was none."
2,seen it before,"best actor yes best movie oscar no.another movie with a use your imagination ending.already seen that on the sopranos,didnt like it then either"
5,Outstanding DRAMA!,I have to say this was/is one of the BEST films I have seen in a very long time! Javier Bardem.. WOW.. what a performance! He will now be forever ranked with the likes of Anthony Hopkins / Hannibal Lecter!!I can't wait to watch this on DVD to catch the hidden gems that I missed in the theater.
2,disappointing but not surprised,"I should have known, the academy has a track record...they pick the obvious, the action, but not the really good movies.Some of the actors were really good...the movie was a C at best."
2,Unravels After the Middle of the Movie,"Photography, editing, sound, acting -- Wonderful! I couldn't take my eyes off the screen! Then about the middle of the movie it began to unravel. I began to wonder ""When is all of this going to come together?"" Unfortunately this never happened. I felt very let down by this film, especially because I liked the first half so much. What was the purpose of the Sheriff? Was he only there to comment on the action, like the Chorus in a Greek play? At some point -- at least at the conclusion of the movie -- he needed to interact in some meaningful way. This never happened. He was just there. The disparate parts of the movie never came together; the conclusion was an inconclusion. The sad thing is ""No Country for Old Men"" could have been a great movie and it was not."
1,"Cheap ""case"" is deceptive","This is a 5 star movie. I consider it to be the best film I've seen in the 21st century, thus far.This is a review of the product that was shipped to me, not of the film itself.I purchased the Blu-ray for $5. Awesome deal. However, the Blu-ray is shipped in some sort of cheap, paper thin case unlike anything I've ever seen before. It looks like a normal case and the edges are plastic, but the main part of the case is just paper. There is literally nothing there. It almost feels like a cheap knockoff you'd buy from a sidewalk vendor.If this product is so cheap because it is housed in budget, amazon no-frills packaging (or whatever), it should be marked as such. Passing it off as a standard product is disingenuous. I know that the important thing is the film itself, especially at this price point. However, I would never have purchased this had I known that it would arrive in such sub-standard packaging.I'll be returning it and buying the 2 disc edition."
2,very very very bad ending!,"Spoiler alert. This movie was a huge let down. I give the movie 2 stars because of the great acting. I can't think of a single word that describes the awful ending. All through the movie Josh Brolins character stays one step ahead of the hit man. He is smart, cunning, and a vietnam vet, and he gets himself killed in some random gun fight? A gun fight that we don't even get to see the details of. How the hell did they find him? Now don't get me wrong I'm not somebody that needs a happy ending every time, but the end of this movie has the good guy getting himself killed. His wife gets killed. The bad guy walks away with a limp, and the sheriff gives up and quits. Are you kidding me?? I would not recommend this movie to my enemy's. nuff said."
2,By Liam,"Taken for just a movie No Country for Old Men provides a suspenseful plot with enhanced by good filmmaking. Unfortunately this is accompanied by one of the worst endings to follow a thriller movie. It provided the watcher with no satisfaction and ended very inconclusively, by letting the bad guy get away while killing off both the main character and his entirely innocent wife. The violence in No Country for Old Men is relentless, excessive, and takes away from the movie by making it far more predictable and repulsive. On the upside there are only a few very suspenseful and scary part but the graphic violence keeps this film out of the family movie section. The movie did the novel by Cormac McCarthy justice but could not rival the description and setting of scenes that occurred in the novel."
2,I dont see what the hype was all about,"Bought it because I bought into all the hype, now I cant force myself to watch it again. Some parts were ok, but overall I was disappointed."
4,this special edition bluray comes too quickly on the heels of the original bluray release,"OK, so it's $5 more than the original BluRay and $20 more than the standard DVD. That's just way too much. The movie looks great and has a digital copy and Bardem is genuinely spooky as an assassin. But you probably have a Cormac McCarthy poster on your wall if you're ready to buy this. And putting out a pricier Special Edition on BluRay after putting out the already expensive original BluRay release is highly questionable. This is the last thing you need to do when launching a format -- make people who have committed to it feel like they bought a title too soon."
2,3/4 of a good movie,"This movie was really good for mot of the movie. The bad guy was really good but then it tuned on you. The main character dies without you even seeing what happened, there's no epic finish to the battle like you were asking for the whole movie and it ended in the middle of a conversation that leaves you asking yourself, WTF. There's too many questions left on answered and if just left me so disappointed. I'm a huge moviegoer and love all kinds of movies and have never been this disappointed in a movie."
2,Most boring movie of the year!,I hate it when I invest 2 hours of my life to see a movie and it has absolutely no ending. You think you are watching a movie and all of a sudden the credits roll and it's over. It felt like they ran out of film. Pointless!
2,"spoiler***spoiler grade B is in, can a crocodile die from eating too much fat?","absolutely nothing new here, a movie about a hitman who is also a serial killer with an agenda, this is grade B writing with grade A actors. as a fan of blood and guts shoot em ups i enjoyed that part of the movie. but believe me i expected more from a movie that won all these awards...bllaaaahhhhh...hollywood says its artsy craftsy so it must be? NO WAY!!! the plot twist? oh it looks like the serial killer gets away, and the star is a coward some real creative wrtining there. lol. i do like the idea that a grade b movie gets an oscar YES lol"
1,dvd,very disappointed...could never go with the flow...didnt have a flow...had no plot...worst thing I ever seen Tommy Lee do...
1,Redefining bad,"What tripe this movie is. Four Academy awards indeed. Another load of crap from the dilettantes at the Academy and their snuggly pals. Pointlessly violent from beginning to end. With the cast it had a chance to be better, but apparently these folks live in a world so insular they think they ""get it"" and really don't have a clue. And we wonder where young adults get the idea to spread and engage in pointless mayhem and murder. This would be a great training film for gangs."
1,Depraved,"I don't understand why this film is so highly praised. What is it really about? If the answer is that it is an examination of ultraviolence, then what is our response, our counter to this spectacle? The film seems to say that there is no counter, that we're stupid, greedy, idiots who can't get out of our own way enough to save our own skin. When confronted with evil we sell out our families, betray our morals, and act so stupidly that we're all but predetermined to fail. That's a harsh indictment of man's ingenuity, perseverance, and moral fiber; I think it's BS."
2,I want my two hours back!,"This movie started out pretty good, even though the idea of a down on his luck dude finding money has been done already (A Simple Plan, etc).However the movie breaks down rather quickly into fantasy and implausible occurrences.Primarily, it is unbelievable that the main character is so easily traceable, especially since this movie takes place in the '80s.Secondly, the Tommy Lee Jones sheriff is completely tertiary to the action and plot. Waste of time.The ending was horrible - made me wish I never wasted my time watching the movie in the first place.This is a case where they probably tried to make it too close to the book (haven't read it, but that's the only reasonable explanation) but forgot that in a movie, you have to have someone tell you or show you what's going on. You can't just have characters show up out of nowhere and then not have any explanation for anything."
3,"Overrated, But Worth a Look","No Country for Old Men is one of those movies you just can't wait to see if it lives up to all the hype. Well, the first half of the film had me glued to the screen. I only wish the second half could have been anything close.C'mon folks, the movie had intrigue, really cool characters, interesting dialogue...everything going for it. And then poof, it's all gone. What happened? Why would any writer or director let this happen?Watch the first half of this movie, stop the DVD, and then make-up your own ending.My three stars is only for the first half. The second half gets a -3 stars.See ya next review."
2,2 Thumbs Down,"The Academy must've did a coin toss for best movie. This movie had a poor and incomplete storyline, senseless unexplained violence, and some of the dialogue sounded like the directors made it up in their sleep. Total waste of 2 hours, don't waste your money!"
2,worst ending in the history of cinema,"This was a terrific and captivating movie yet I cannot ignore the terrible ending. It's the worst ending I had ever seen not neccesarily due to the content but because it took this totally engrossing movie and, basically, just pulled the plug on it!Damn you Coen brothers!"
2,virulent misanthropy,"This is a well crafted film on all levels. Nevertheless it left me feeling as if someone had emptied the contents of their bowels in my lap. Its slick, taut surface serves to push Cormac McCarthy and by extension the Coen brother's virulent misanthropy to the end. If you think cynicism is good film making then I have an antidote for you: Frank Capra's 1936 subversive screwball comedy, 'Mr Deeds Goes to Town'. It will make laugh, it will make you think and it will make you glad to be alive. Whereas 'No Country For Old Men' merely made me want to go have a good wash."
1,No country for lousy films,"The promotion of this film was better than the film. Once you get past the first half dozen or so random killings and the deadpan acting, the rest is even worse. The idea that the film is sending some sort of insightful message about random violence is without merit. After about the first 10 minutes anyone with an IQ above about 30 should figure out random violence is bad and by the way have you noticed random violence is bad? Save your time, save your money and just watch the news.Random violence is bad. Wow what an insight!This film is evidence of how far the standards for films has fallen in the industry."
1,Don't waste your time on this movie,"My actual rating is MINUS 5 Stars.This movie was good up until the end. What a major let down. As another reviewer put it ... the ending leaves you pissed off, I mean really pissed off. I wasted an evening of my life watching this film. The useless ending ruined the entire movie.I find it totally unbelievable that so many people would rate this movie with more than 1 star, it deserves minus 5 stars because of the terrible ending."
1,This movie sucks!,I hated this movie! It was like watching a couple of scenes but not the whole thing! It left a lot out!
1,Coen Brothers Jump Shark,"The Coen brothers have finally spoofed themselves. This movie sucks. Don't waste your time or money. It wasn't even watchable, I found myself wanting to find something to read. Believe me when I say, this isn't on the same level as Fargo or even Raising Arizona. It's way, way down there. Oh, and the elitist remark the brothers make on the making of doc., about someone living in a double wide and working at Walmart, was just plain snobbery. These boys have been in Beverly Hills too long."
1,This is not sublime art NOR even nouveau art,"Plenty of great acting .. but the story is a mess .. the way characters are able to travel and find each other without a hint of how in the heck they do .. is ridiculous .. And .. the resolution of each character is so anti-climatic .. (cue intellectuals to knee-jerk in approval .. ) all the character development is betrayed and the plot is left unresolved in gaping dead ends because it seemed like a great artsy idea .. because the film makers are too lazy and too lame to figure out a way for the characters and the story to proceed in any way that makes sense or even in an artistic, symbolic fashion .. I dont watch the Academy Awards any more because their award choices are so WRONG .. So I am not surprised it won Academy Awards because this picture is certainly stupid enough to win Academy Award votes from the current Academy .. This picture does deserve a Brilliant Acting WASTED Award .."
1,They need a sequel just to kill the bastard!,"As you can see from my title, this is an extremely unsatisfying movie. As a matter of fact, it is actually annoying because it almost seems as if they were trying to make it unsatisfying. Who are they trying to impress? If they think that is art, it is not. Rather, I think they are trying to hard and it shows. Real art appears effortless. Michelangelo said his David was already in the rock. He merely chipped away all that was not David. By trying to hard, this movie actually bends truth (the essence of art) by depicting a human being who is so depraved and devoid of any humanity that he must kill every other person he meets in the film. I'm sorry, really, every other person? That is a bit of a stretch. Are there really people like that? In the mind of the twisted freak who made this movie, maybe."
1,Pointless,"Half the characters didn't even have a reason for being in the movie, and the other half died from a bolt gun. I can't imagine why they thought to make this movie."
1,No Conclusion for Old or Young Men,"Aside from the killing and the motive. I never really understood the movie. I understand that sometimes the bad guy gets away and that sometimes the small town sherif can't cope anymore, but in movies or even real life, the police never stop looking. I give this an A for being a mystery, but an F for not giving us the satisfaction of being right or wrong in our own conclusion."
5,Best movie of the new millenium,"To all who have not seen this movie, see the movie before reading reviews. Apparently from the mixed reviews, this is either a love or hate movie. In my opinion, my title for this review says it all about this film. The Coens and their wonderful cast have hit gold. This the ""Fargo"" of the West. Although a different ""war"" is fought here, I will state that this is the ""Platoon"" of the 2000s. This film will stand the test of time. To coin a phrase, this is the Texas ""Terminator"". What a film!!!!!"
3,Blu-Ray needs RE CALL,I bought a Blu-Ray disc and there's a sound issue.I don't think this is only my blu-ray problem.There are two sound tracks added.One is PCM uncompressed and the other is normal 5.1 Dolby digital.PCM has a huge issue.The dialogue includes noise. The noise appears whenever there is a dialogue which is really annoying. I think it's some kind of dubbing problem.Also normal Dolby Digital track has a problem too. It's too small. I needed to boost up the volume almost as half louder than normal Blu-Ray discs.Picture quality is good. The movie is superb as usual (As I've seen in the theater.)
1,Dreary ending,"Fatalistic theme- not uplifting at all. I am surprised Tommy Lee Jones agreed to this script. Totally unredeeming. If you watch it do not watch it at night, as it is not a good way to end your day. I do not agree with the directors' abject, anahilistic view of life with no redeeming values at all to be sensed or imparted."
2,No Country for Old Men,"I am very disappointed, despite to well made directing and good acting, the subjext is poorly developped. All the powers were given to Anton Chigurh just like that even if the original book was so written. So, as a summary, WE DID NOT LIKE this film and can not recommed to any of my friends."
3,Package sliced open,"spine of this product was sliced through (about 3"" long slice) all the way through clear plastic and shiny info sheet---very unsightly for the library"
5,The best villain in a long time,"The main villain certainly was a think-outside the box kind of guy. He was a self starter, and had a never say die attitude. Well, maybe I should reword that. Everything the modern day company wants in it's employees. Highly recommended viewing to learn from his no-bounds thinking."
3,"Good film, but ...","2007R: ""... once you quit hearin sir and maam ... rest is soon to follow"". A good, dark film, but the ending leaves too much hanging. MFJLabs 3.5x"
5,The best bad guy ever!,"This is one of the best movies ever made and has THE best ""bad guy"" ever. He's sooo cool! Brilliant acting by Javier Bardem!!"
4,Gritty & intense movie,"Very intense movie, good story lines and actors! Very believable movie, didn't really like the ending...kinda left you hanging!Tom Lee Jones is always worth watching!"
2,Gratuitous Violence,"My husband and I watched this movie because it was on so many top ten lists. The performances were good but the story was boring and the ""ending"" very unsatisfying. The reviews expecially liked how the director mixed in real people. I guess since I have known many Texans that it wasn't anything exotic to me."
5,Great buy,"This came quickly in the mail and I have had no issues with it's performance. I tried it out within a couple days of receiving it, and was impressed with the blu-ray quality. And especially for the price, this was a no-brainer."
3,Great movie without a climax...,"5 star movie with a 1 star ending = 3 star ratingSimply put, this is a great movie with a terrible ending. The acting is superb and the story keeps you interested. It is one of those movies that keep you so engaged that you forget you are watching a movie. This movie would get 5 stars if they would have actually created a climax to it. The ending is non existent. It's like they took a pair of scissors and decided to cut the film off at some random location."
4,NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN,"AFTER SEEING THIS MOVIE AT THE THEATRE, THE DVD THAT I PURCHASED WAS JUST AS IF I WERE SEEING IT FOR THE FIRST TIME. THERE WERE PARTS THAT I COMPLETELY FORGET ABOUT. INTENSE AND THE ACTORS WERE SO CONVINCING, ESPECIALLY JAVIER BADEM. SUPERB EDITING, SUPERB ACTING AND AN OSCAR WINNER!!"
3,No country for old men by Brandon M. Moskos,"I was extremely disappointed in this film. I really don't understand why and how this film got best picture. I bought this dvd, but this movie has way too much violence and it is extremely predictable!!! I thought the acting was really good, but the story-line was weak. A man takes money from a drug deal gone bad and soon he is the target of a stone cold killer. It shows all the effects that happen because this man decided to take the money. My thing is that who didn't know that there was a tracking device in the briefcase that the money was in????? I knew that right off the bat. How predictable is that? How else would the killer know where the guy with the money was running and hiding? Average and predictable, Please rent, don't buy."
2,DVD-transfer is so-so,"This is a review of the DVD quality, not the movie. The movie is awesome. The DVD is ok. A mediocre-quality digital transfer with distracting levels of blurring, over-saturated black-levels, and compression artifacts.The Blu-Ray version looks waaaay better.I've seen plenty of DVDs that looked nearly as good as HDTV (HD-DVD or Blu-ray). Not this one. There's a substantial difference here. I use a Toshiba HD-A2 (720p) and a PS3, on new Pioneer 50"" Kuro 720p plasma.You'd think they'd take care to make an excellent DVD transfer of a new release of this caliber, but apparently they didn't think it was important enough to spend the time and money to do it right since this is ""just"" DVD. Even if it would steal some shine from their blu-ray."
5,Wow!,"Loved this movie. It is so beautiful to look at it's amazing. The actors are uniformly excellent here. Bardem is a pure evil killing machine and will scare the crap out of you. It is long, but it pulls you into the story so intently that it feels much shorter than its running time. The Coens have done it again."
1,Well....,"The Coen brothers went out to the desert, stood over an empty film can, released their bowels, closed the can, slapped a ""No Country for Old Men"" sticker on it and then shipped it to Hollywood where it received an award.It happened just like that!"
1,I Need Closure,"There isn't much I can say about this movie, I just had to come up with something so I could rate it & hopefully prevent amazon from bombarding my inbox with it. I hated this flick. I love Tommy Lee Jones, and his character was quite good - actually, the characters weren't so much the problem as the plodding pace of the movie itself. Even the plot was ok, but I was hoping for something a little faster. It reminded me of all those foreign intrigue dramas from the 70s & early 80s that I'd fall asleep to when I was sick home from school. I also need closure in my movies. I need to know what exactly happens to the characters without having to visit forums and 'cons. Twist endings are fine, the occasional cliff-hanger here and there, but in long, drawn out movies I would at least hope to be gratified with some closure. I suppose I could pick up the book somewhere and flip to the last chapter, but the movie left me afraid to pick up the book."
1,ZZZzzzzzzz,"A veritable snooze fest occasionally interrupted with acts of gratuitous violence. I understand what the story was trying to get across, but this was one of the least entertaining films I've ever had the misfortune of viewing."
3,Good ! Intriguing ! Waiting for ?? Fell off the edge of my seat !!,What a movie took us all the way to the top Yoh !!! Then the production team lost the writer script or the writer never finished the story ?? The bad guy slinked away with a broken arm we think ?? and wait for it !! the good guy retired !!! Come on !! finish the movie it's only a few bucks more !!
2,what happened?,"I watched the movie, never read the book, heard the hype and read other reviews. I have to say I am very disappointed in this film. It was great until the last 5 minutes. Then it just.... wandered off to nowhere. No closure, no real ending. Did they leave it open for a sequel? Are they going to create serial killer serial films? That is the only thing that makes sense with this ending.The acting is very good. The cinematography is great. The sounds are great. The plot is good... until the end.I would recommend this movie only if you have 2 hours of time to waste... and remember you won't get it back.The coen brother have done other great films. 'Blood Simple', 'Fargo' and 'Miller's Crossing' come to mind immediately and each of those is superb. I would recommend watching one of those first, or instead of."
5,Review for No Country for Old Men,The movie is as advertised. So if you like this kind of movie you will like this product. It arrived on time and was in new condition.
3,Feels half done,"While it starts off very intense with lots of cat and mouse moments, it stops roughly half way through and ends up leaving a lot of unanswered questions. While its neat that you kind of ""get to make your own ending"" it hurts that the latter half of the movie does not show exact details and just kinda half shows you what is going on. Overall I enjoyed it, but I felt like I only got to read half the book and just skimmed the latter half if you know what I mean."
3,weak ending,"Good movie but the ending is weak doesn't even show what happens to the main guy or his wife. otherwise its a good movie, it would have been better if the ending was done a little better."
2,"needs Geritol, a plot , and an ending.","NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN is so old and tired it can't get out of it's own way. It doesn't even struggle to its feet in order to at least end well. After a couple of tedious hours of the bad guy dragging about a cattle gun attached to a compressed air tank, the Coen brothers are so pleased with themselves, they decide to insult the audience with nothing more clever or novel than a blank screen ending. I was, however, relieved it was over.I understand the existential angst of the film. The Coen's do portray convincingly the aching despair, hopelessness, and helplessness of the human condition. They point to the gathering storm and darkness on the horizon. Unfortunately, this particular film does not illuminate. I want to tell them that they got it wrong and it's okay; the end has been written; evil is vanquished and the prince of darkness loses."
1,No Country For Old Men,"Incoherent. Meaningless. Vacuous. Mind-numbing. Pointless. A crucifixion to sit through. It redefines the meaning of senseless. Academy Award stuff? ARRGH! Better, much better, to have sat in a closet and spent the time more usefully contemplating the vagaries of the Chinese language. A lot of people should go to jail for their involvement in this travesty. Abysmal is inadequate. Talk softly, kill a lot of people for no reason, and whatever happened to the money? The reason it is on DVD right now is that folks would throw up the theaters -- better at home. More sanitary. In the history of films, this ranks below Ed Wood's worst effort. The foregoing to the contrary notwithstanding, however, it stank to the high heavens. MISS IT!"
1,No Country For Old Men 2 ?????,"So when do we get to see the season 2 ????, cant wait to see how it ends !!!!. I have about 2 dozen older dvd`s that would knock this film into a cocked hat, not sure what the 5 star rating people saw what I didn`t, it has to me !!!!!!!!"
3,NAAHHH ITS GOOD BUT NO ENDING U DONT KNOW WHAT HAPPEN,"YEAH ITS LONG MOVIE BUT GOOD & SUCKS AT THE SAME TIME U DONT KNOW WHAT HAPPEN AT THE END, MAYBE PART 2 IS COMING SOON LOL. RENT IT 1ST LIKE I DID YEAHHH"
1,Do you have something lower than one star?,"Rented the movie trying to guage for myself ""why all the hype?"". What were the people who gave this an award smoking? It would take an LSD trip just to make it bearable. The story jumped all over the place. You had to keep a score card, just when it was getting a little interesting...Pan over to Tommy Lee Jones who gives a soliloque that sounded like the rambings of a man precariously close to Alzheimer's Disease. The movie ends and for a few seconds you are like a deer in the headlights, when you get over that you walk over to the DVD player, slap the DVD back in the case, hang your head and admit to God and the world that you just wasted a little over 2 hours of your life. Surely the actors realized they were in a bomb. Oh well, we live and learn, I learned never to rent a COen Brothers movie again."
1,No Country for Old Men,"In order to appreciate this particular movie you must have a healthy appetite for straight-up gratuitous violence, because this is a one-course meal. The plot was weak, the premise was depressingly dark; after the initial killings suspense pretty much disappeared, because there was no surprise in anything that followed. Gorey? Yes. Dark to the point of hopeless? Yes. If the theme was intended to be the age-old ""Good vs Evil"", well, the point was driven home ad nauseum, and, well, let's just say Good looks pretty outmatched. All the way through to the end. I felt I was watching a documentary on execution-type murders. Ho-hum.Academy Award winner... they must have been watching a different movie."
1,Shame on the studio for double-dipping,"Great way to get the consumer to build up a Blu-Ray collection, double-dip a year after the original release."
1,Fail,Starts strong about 2/3 of the way thru it bombs. i was truly disappointed i had high hopes since all i heard was praises from critics. i am not sure what movie other people saw but this is not and award wining movie in my opinion.
1,What a waste of talent!,"This is one of the worst films I have seen in recent years. It is difficult to believe that it received an Oscar for best picture. Technically it is excellent: in cinematography, acting, editing. But the subject is crazy -- just an excuse for one pointless bloody scene after another as more than 20 people are brutally murdered for no reason. Some critics have seen this as a profound comment on violence in our time. To me it is just sick, sick, sick. Of course, if you like numerous closeups of bodies and jagged bloodily wounds, you might really dig this film. You might also consider visiting your local slaughterhouse."
1,No Country For Old Men - SUCKS,"This movie was senseless violence with no point. It was a total waste of my evening. I regret spending a single cent to view such garbage. Come on... if you are going to get all ""artsy"" on me, do so... not this rubbish."
5,Simply Great,"Not do disparage some of the other folks who have taken the time to post a review, but....Never mind. This isn't the time or place...Great film, great direction, great acting... To call this film ""predictable"" is... what films have you been watching that you would term unpredictable??"
5,Intense drama,"When I first saw this movie in the theatre, I thought the ending of this movie completely ruined the movie. As days passed, I kept thinking about this movie. I then realized that this movie really got to me. The fact that I was still thinking about this movie days after made me realize that the directors, actors, and the story were truly gripping. I may not agree with the ending but the ending doesn't discount the fact that this movie is thought provoking."
1,Waste of time,"This movie leaves the viewer without anyone to feel good about. If you enjoy watching semi-graphic violence with strange insertions of characters who's lives have no importance, then this is for you. Otherwise, it is a waste of 2 1/2 hours of your life. The ending is simply lacking, as if the writers tried to leave you with a feeling of suspense but instead it leaves you wondering why you would watch a story with so many depictions of murders without a ultimate point."
1,Huh?,"The movie and story are pointless. It starts with an unexplained act of violence and ends with nothing for a conclusion or resolution. To put it in the words I wanted to use, but since I would not meet the 20 word minimum, the movie sucks!"
5,Near Flawless Filmmaking,"This is the first film of the year I've seen and immediately felt compelled to go and buy another ticket. Javier Bardem basically embodies stateless terrorism and he deserves every acting award that's coming to him, but it's also important to note that Tommy Lee Jones delivers a performance on par with his work in Three Burials AND Bardem. That said, the performances are nearly flawless -- just like the filmmaking. AO Scott's write-up in the New York Times hits the nail on the head. If you love a lean script, subtle camera work, nuanced dialogue, gorgeous cinematography and sound; then this is going to be on your Top Ten list for the year. If you have trouble deciphering poetry and would prefer to see people being shot and things blowing up...well, you get that too. (9/10)"
2,Not worthy of an academy award,"The Academy has gotten into a rut. Grim, gritty and violent movies seem to have the inside track for best picture. What ever happened to great entertainment? There's no way this ""B"" movie belongs in the company of the great movies of the past."
3,The ending blows.,"Plot summary: Cowboy looking guy finds 2 million dollars and runs off with it. Psychokiller with helmet hair and a bulky cattle killing device hunts cowboy looking guy down like a dog.Too bad the ending blows, because the first 90 minutes are fantastic!Through the bulk of ""No Country,"" I thought--""This movie is one of the best movies I've seen."" When I wasn't covering my eyes in horror, I was on the edge of my seat with my knuckles in my mouth. But, like a sugar high it must unfortunately and inevitably come to an end--a crashing, disappointing, tiresome end.It's obvious to me the directors and writers had no idea how to end what could have been a masterpiece and just sort of bumbled something up. And this ""something""--this ""trying so hard to be symbolic and meaningful"" ending was in actuality shallow, pretentious and disappointing.I still recommend it though--the first 90 minutes are pretty damn good."
3,No Ending for Old Men!,"This movie has no ending. That's what I don't like. I can accept a depressing or a happy ending but I don't feel comfortable with no ending. Besides that, Javier Bardem's acting is scary.It's worth watching once."
2,no country for good movies,"it was a good movie till it ended, but it was like there was no end, it was abrupt and open like they just stopped filming the movie all of the sudden. plus you had to guess about a few things that happened in the movie like did the bad guy kill the wife? why did the woody harrelson character go find the case but then leave it there? to artsy and mostly hype i think."
3,The Cohens' sentimental mistake,"My two favorite movies, Lebowski and Oh Brother, were made by the Coens, but this is beautiful film marred by an idiotic departure from the novel. In the novel, the old sheriff's backstory is crucial: he considers himself a coward, and lives with deep shame, because he survived his company's massacre in war while his men died. This is crucial to making him a rounded character. The Coens sentimentalize him by dropping this. He's just a loveable old coot. A grievous artistic mistake. They should be ashamed."
2,3/4 of a great movie,"I was really enjoying this movie. Indeed, I thought it was once of the best I had ever seen and well worth an Oscar...right up until I saw the last half hour. Without giving away a MAJOR spoiler I will say that there is a major plot twist, and while I could have live with what happened I don't like how it happened. Some movie watchers will think it is genius and some (like me) will be really mad. It is worth watching this movie at least once to find out for yourself if you love or hate it. For an hour and a half, this is a great movie."
5,Evil does exist,Thoroughly enjoyed this film. Kept me and my wife on the edge of our seats throughout the movie and not with a bunch of faked special effects or mind numbing action sequences. If you like victorious heroes and happy endings... better stick with the Disney films. Evil does exist in this world.
4,An excellent film from begining to end.,"This is one of the better films made in the past several years. Josh Brolin, Javier Bardem and Tommy Lee Jones give absolutely superior performances; in fact, there's not a sub-standard performance in the entire film. A must see film!"
5,Tommy Lee Jones strikes again,"One of the few times where the movie was as good if not better than the book. All the main characters were superb; but Tommy Lee Jones was the one who should have gotten an Oscar for best male actor. Like Peckinpaw's WILD BUNCH, this is not a movie for the squeamish or to view with youngsters ( under 15 ? ); but beautiful photography and a story that will keep you on the edge of your seat."
4,Best Westerns of all time!!,"While ""No Country for Old Men"", is an awesome movie, it's not a Western! You're list loses its legitimacy with its presence!!!"
4,Enjoy the movie.,I enjoyed the movie and wanted to have the video. So I bought it. Very bad men in a laid back county.
3,Ending?,"The film has it's great moments, but the ending killed it for me. Worse ending ever for a movie. 5 stars for the acting, characters, and atmosphere. 0 stars for the ending. Such potential ruined by the terrible ending. The movie was unfinished."
1,Absolutely Awful,"Instead of a taut thriller like Blood Simple, their first film of this genre, the brothers have made a violent, unbelievable, repulsive film.Javier Bardem is a reverse Rambo who kills practically a third of Texas with impunity. Tommy Lee Jones was good in a role like this twenty or thirty years ago. He probably was using Barden's oxygen tank while not is use on the set.The ending was pathetic. After Tommy Lee Jones mumbled obviously ""heavy"" dialogue that needed subtitles for those who could not read lips, the film ends.After watching this film, I will not go to another Oscar best film for many years. Shame on all involved."
1,Suicidal,i don't seem to appreciate coen brothers--call it lack of intellectual capacity or the urge to see something worthwhile. it was a waste of my time and money.
1,Worst movie ever made,"This dreadful excuse for a movie should never have seen the light of day. I wish I could have the time back I spent watching, hoping in vain for it to get better.... It doesn't."
2,Amazon has a bogus free shipping policy,"If you take 'free shipping' Amazon takes their sweet time shipping it. After a week, when tracking the product and finding out they wouldn't be shipping for nine days, I cancelled and reordered, paying for shipping, and got the product in a more reasonable time. Free Shipping is a good 'come on' but if you want it this year, pay for the shipping."
1,Just a very bad movie,"I don't get it. Do not know what the hype is all about. This movie sucked. This movie once again proves that the critics don't have a clue, the Oscars are meaningless, and people will buy into anything.It is two hours I wish I could get back."
1,Horrible!!!,"It's one of those ""What the heck was that!!"" movies. It was very good up until the end. 1st of all, I think Tommy Lee Jones' character was utterly useless. So was the deputy. My goodness what was the point. I won't spoil the movie, because I dislike when reviewers do that, but i will say that the end is extremely disatisfying.The acting was excellent, in every way, but the character placement was very out of place. The ending is so utterly ridiculous that I got the sense that they ran out of ideas for an ending and decided to end it for the sake of doing so. I don't understand why movies like these are Oscar nomination worthy. I felt the same about American Beauty. What a waste of a nomination.Still, I thought the acting and the story did provide a reason to watch. The ending is the reason I gave it only one star."
1,Worst Coen Brothers Movie,"I am a Coen Brothers fan. Fargo, and O Brother Where Art Thou, are in my top ten all time favorite movies. No Country For Old Men just doesn't cut it.Yes, there is some witty dialogue(""Can you validate?""; ""I work at Walmart""), but as an overall movie I was extremely disappointed. I could go on and on, however, as an example of just one of the flaws in the movie......- You discover a transmitter that lets the bad guys know exactly where you are, but you don't destroy it. You just let it continue transmitting. And then you sit directly in front of the hotel room door, when you know from the shadows underneath the door, that the guy who is trying to kill you is at the door?? HELLOOO!!!!!????I really looked forward to this movie, but after seeing it, I can't help but shake my head. I was thinking of buying this, sight unseen, just because it was a Coen Brothers movie. I am glad I didn't."
1,Simply a murder movie. Plot zero.,"Purchased and watched when first out on DVD. Could not believe the idiocy of the plot. Racism on all fronts and nothing but mindless violence. Perhaps the Coen bros. are making attempts at anti-gun political leanings, but so worthless I was shocked.Don't waste your time or dollars on this. Every level reaks of reverse racism. Perhaps that's the true reason for making such a waste of time and energy."
1,Dips,"There is no way I am buying a second Blu-Ray copy of this movie. As much as I like the movie and everything the brothers Coen do, there is no possible justification for spending more money on it. Great way to annoy and alienate early adopters of Blu-Ray. At the very least, they should offer a upgrade path or buy-back for those of us who bought the original release on Blu-Ray."
2,No Country For Old Men,"I was SO disappointed. It was senseless and left unanswered questions. I can't EVEN believe it got awards. I rarely do reviews, but I felt compelled to pass this one on. Don't waste your time unless you enjoy a story with little direction and nothing good comes out of it. Thumbs down. If you like killing for no reason, watching decent people murdered, and an ending with no closure... perhaps this is for you. It was not for me! The only thing I CAN say, is the acting was okay. I really felt this could have turned out MUCH better than it did. Again... Thumbs down!"
2,Not Oscar Worthy,"I haven't read the original text, but judging solely on the movie I can honestly say that this film did not deserve an Oscar. It wasn't horrible, but it's also not a movie I'd recommend to anyone. The general story is actually quite good and there are some great action sequences, but overall the plot plods along and the whole thing moves at a snail's pace. My biggest gripe is with the ending, or lack thereof. Sometimes abrupt endings without any sort of resolution can work, but this one seemed like they ran out of film and just decided to chop off the last 15 minutes."
2,Another Over-Rated Oscar Movie,"Once again the Oscars prove that they have no ability to label what is a ""good"" and entertaining movie. This is the biggest over-hyped, 2-hour long ""AVERAGE"" movie I have seen in quite some time. I love movies, love them...and in my opinion have a very wide range of tolerances towards movies that want to bring the viewer into the film, surround them with characters and scenarios, but those wonderful movies also leave you at the end with closure.I understand this was an ""artistic"" movie as so many other people have commented. But to say that it is a theatrical masterpiece is pushing the limits!"
3,HOW THE HUM WAS HO'D,"Javier Bardem is a killer so single minded he seems simple minded. (So does his performance.) Tommy Lee Jones is a tired sheriff who checks in every now & again to see where the plot has got to, yawns and checks out. The only characters of interest are played by Josh Brolin & Kelly Macdonald & what happens to them just underscores the unpleasantness of the whole thing. It's NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD with Bardem playing all the zombies. It takes more than hitting notes to make music."
4,Better than I expected.,"I expected nothing much more than a blood bath, but it was way better than that. Snappy dialog, sly humor, great scenery and well acted by all. What's to not like?I probably would have missed this movie entirely, if so much fuss hadn't been made over it, because of the way it was presented as ""nothing but violence."" Not true!"
5,Coen Brothers Collection,Added this great thriller to our Coen Brother's collection - this is one of their best. Great acting by Javier Bardem.
3,Well Done Slasher Film,"In short, ""No County For Old Men"" is really well done slasher film. No doubt that the Coen brother's bring an incredible amount of suspense to the film, but at it's core, the movie does not have a lot to say. Mr. Bardem's soulless killing machine is truly chilling and probably deserved Oscar's best actor nod. Yes, the movie has plot holes: Why was Chigurh arrested at the very beginning? How did he happen upon the crime scene with the two individuals that he subsequently dispatched? Yet, these can be overlooked by not only incredible acting, but also some of the most understated cinematography in a film this year."
3,"Devaluing Human Life with Murder, Money and Mayhem","I don't think this movie is Best Picture material. That said, we have here another character to match the evil of Hannibal in Silence of the Lambs. Whereas Hannibal was an ingenius, clever villin, Chigurh is just a plain madman gone wild. There is no point to this. It is like an animal bent on carnage and surviving in the human jungle. I could watch a nature channel about Lions and get the same thing. At least the Lions kill for food, as Hannibal did.The only reason this movie escapes a 1 or 2 star is because Tommy Lee Jones is in it. His acting is worth watching and he makes the sheriff a unique character. Other than that, it's pretty lame."
3,What would you do?,Interesting study on human behavior. Very violent. Can't believe there are people like this in the world but there are stranger things that have happened.
4,No Country 4 Old Men,"This is a solid movie with great actors. The video quality is excellent, but expected since I bought the blu-ray version. Case was damaged upon arrival so I am not too pleased about that. Appears that whomever handled the case squeezed too hard with their thumb and broke though the recycled plastic."
5,Excellent Action/Suspense Flic,This is one of my all time favorite action and suspense movies. Lots of dramatic action and suspense. It will keep you on the edge of your seat. It has won an Academy Award.
3,a mixed bag,"The atmosphere and mood of this movie are so well done that I can't give it anything less than 3 stars. And the acting by all the characters was superb. Unfortunately the story line jumps over the climactic showdown and just comes to an end; I guess some more Coenesque style, but the reasoning escapes me. Then again, I haven't really cared for any of the Coens' other films, except O Brother Where Art Thou."
4,"A Good, Solid Story","While disturbing, the story is a very basic one with good, solid acting and dialogue. Nothing artsy, eloquent or subtle here... no happy ending either (be warned)."
2,Long Road to Nowhere,"The acting was superb and the direction was excellent, but I felt as if I just wasted two hours. Unfortunately it's a long winding story that never really satisfies the viewer with a true ending. Nothing is really resolved at the end. Truly disappointed, 2.5 stars."
2,Not Joining The 'Gushfest',"Wow. The reviews from just about every credible source is simply gushing over this flick (""...best film of the DECADE!""). I love my violence, I love my Coen Bros. and I just could not get behind this one.Apparently, it's flat out cinematic genius. I'd be nuts to recommend that you not see it. Still, if you like a slightly more ""human"" story with a tad more character development around ""found money,"" check out A Simple Plan."
1,Two hours of violence for your 'entertainment'.,"For those of you who enjoyed being scared by Anthony Hopkins in Silence of the Lambs, you should really enjoy Javier Bardem in this movie. For those of you who don't appreciate being scared and believe that movies that show violence should make the consequences of violence, (grieving parents, disfigurement, ruined lives,) apparent to the viewer, then this movie is not for you. All it is is scary violence. For two hours."
1,AMAZON SUCKS,"I BOUGHT THIS OVER A WEEK AGO AND IT WAS SUPPOSEDLY ""DELIVERED"" LAST SATURDAY AT 1PM. I WAS HERE THEN I PULLED OUT THE MAIL ITS NOT TRUE!!! I LOOKED ALL OVER THE BUSHES, WITH NEIGHBORS, ETC, IT WASNT DELIVERED!! WILL NOT BUY FROM AMAZON AGAIN THEY ARE A BUNCH OF SHIFTY EYED CROOKS. DO YOURSELF A FAVOR AND SHOP SOMEWHERE ELSE WHERE THEY DON'T LIE TO YOU ABOUT WHAT YOU BOUGHT."
1,Really?,"Did I just see 2 movies? The first half was really cool until it just shifted; did the budget run out? Was Tommy Jones crying about not being the main character? This started off way promising then just deflates like a week old balloon. What a stupid movie, making me care about a character who suddenly dies with no explanation. Really?"
3,A matter of opinion,"Well done production.Slow moving and yet sometimes the thematic elements are difficult to grasp.The casting is excellent. However, if you're a Tommy Lee Jones fan, be careful. He's totally subdued within his character with limited screen time.Chilling and captivating as the storyline progresses.Confusing and irritating in its denouement.Did it deserve the Oscar for Best Picture?Strictly...a matter of opinion."
3,WORST ENDING EVER,"i never read the novel so icant say how it compares, but whatching this film i was enthralled and loving it untill the ending....it seemed like it was rushed and slamned together. and i was soooooo disappoointed how it ended with the characters. alot of people love it great but for me i was left with utter disappointment i will never watch this movie again."
2,Misfire!,"Listen: I love the Cohens, right back to Blood Simple. I mean, these guys are genius. But this is a bad adaptation of a very, very good book.They've taken the bare plot bones of the book and shot it literally, nearly scene for scene. The problem with this approach is that the heart of the book isn't in the plot. It's in the inner life of the protagonist, the sheriff, and in the book the reader is taken by hand through this inner world of aging and dread. The Cohen's obviously think they've captured this by implication, and by a couple of scenes with the sheriff and his wife and father. But they have not. So, in the end, the viewer is just left hanging, wondering what the hell just happenned. This movie is, ultimately, as phony and one dimensional as The Blair Witch Project. Granted, everyone gives dandy performances. But to what effect? If you liked this movie, and if you didn't like this movie, read the book. Now that's a work of art."
4,good,"I've had mine for a couple of years now. It works great, the amp clamp is a good feature to have not only to measure amperage flowing through a wire, but also to clamp it onto something to see it easier. It has a nice auto off feature to save the 9v battery. It has very high ratings at 1k v ac or dc, and 1k amps ac or dc. To get something comparable from fluke will cost a premium.Complaints, it only reads voltage down to hundredths so, thousandths are rounded off. The display is not too big and isn't or won't backlight. The leads it comes with are just so so. I ended up getting a kit with a bunch of clips and such to add versatility. The continuity beeper isn't very loud, but loud enough to hear if there isn't noisy background stuff goin on.Pricing here looks good, I think I paid about 260. Overall it's a good tool. I didn't want to spring the excess cash for a fluke."
1,an expensive piece of junk,"This filterbag is simply the same filterbag comes with the unit. The difference is that the fabric is denser and thicker hoping that it will catch the sand and silt. But in reality, it is not working. Probably because of the thick fabric, the water cannot go through the filter freely. The suction power is not as strong. I do see sand in the bag but not much. Ther sand is stirred up. You will see next day that it goes back to the bottom of the pool. It is very expensive as a filter. I don't object people making decent profit out of great products. But this filter is way too expensive for what it does or should I say what it does not."
3,The master of record album graphic design,I would happily have awarded this marvellous book 5-stars were it not for the fact that most of the album cover images have been badly cropped. 'Nuff said.
4,old school,I received this as a gift and that is eactly what it is. I grew up loving this show and to have all episodes at my finger tips is awesome. Although the quality is okay I still watch and can't wait to hand them down to my daughter. Great find.
5,Down in Fraggle Rock!,Bought them as a gift for my grandson...his mom loved the series when she was a young so I thought it only fitting to let him enjoy them as well. he loves the Fraggles! Dances with the music and sits for the whole show and then wants another.
4,This is a very special collection,"For those who have interest on having a deep background on the Jim Henson's productions, this collection will full fill this very well. Fraggle Rock was made thinking on children, but have consider that parents should be interest on the program first to aprove it for children, so it does.Special interviews and material make the collection a complete product that show all the detail an effort being set on the series.Very good one. For me just need the spanish sutitles (that suppose to come according to the package) but are not in there."
1,Fraggle Rock Season 4 on DVD,I personally have not purchased this item. I do know from reading its description that it includes the 4th season(Final Season) If you are purchasing this for solely that reason then I would highly recommend waiting until 11-3-2009.[...]
1,Wrong Country Code Update,"I love Fraggle Rock. I was very disappointed when I tried to view the DVDs and wasn't able to because they wouldn't play in any of my DVD players (all different brands). When I put it in my computer DVD player it came up with the warning ""wrong country code"". If you want a review of the content of Fraggle Rock, I have seen the shows on TV...they are great. Both children and adults can be entertained by the Fraggles. Don't let the packaging stop you from buying a really great show. Jim Henson doesn't make bad stuff.I've since reordered this collection. It plays well in all my DVD players.The selling price is the best (about half of everyone else). If you like the Jim Henson product then you have to have this collection."
4,Season 4 released!!!,"All Fraggle fans should boycott this until Season 4 is released. Jim Henson and the Fraggles would!! I echo the other reviewers here, this goes against everything this show is about! Unreal.Note: All 4 seasons rate 5 stars and are perfect moral tales for children and adults alike.UPDATE: Season 4 is now released (although not in the same, quality packaging as the first three)"
1,Please do not buy,"If what the other reviewer said is true about not releasing Season 4 separately, please do not buy this complete box set if you have already purchased the first 3 seasons. You will be able to take them out of the library as often as you want anyway. If no one buys it, they will have to release Season 4 separately, and hopefully fire the marketing person who thought this greedy scheme up."
1,Don't buy this until AFTER Season 4 is released,"I had much admiration for HIT when they started releasing the full season box sets of Fraggle Rock. As each season was released, for 3 years, I faithfully bought each season. Now, they greedily withhold the last season and decide to release this full series box set instead. Shame on HIT. It is truly a slap in the face to the fans who bought all the other series as they released them. We supported them, now they do this to thank us for our loyalty to their company? ARE YOU LISTENING HIT?A set like this is great - if all the other seasons have already been released. But it's not the case. Although I will have an incomplete set, I WILL NOT buy this just to get the last episodes. I refuse to buy something twice, just to fall into HIT's marketing gimmick. I've already given HIT over $100 - and I won't give them another $100 so they can laugh at how stupid I am would I buy this.Again, shame on you HIT."
1,Unbelievable,"Well to say why I've rated this is really redundant. All you need to do is look at the other reviewers and you'll see why. I feel betrayed and insulted by what HIT Entertainment is doing. I'm sure I needn't ellaborate here, but I figure the more people who poorly review this item, the better. We need to show those greedy monsters that we're not going to take this injustice. I urge everyone out there to trash this item on every list you see. And for the love of the Rock, do not buy this."
1,BOYCOTT THIS RELEASE UNTIL SEASON FOUR IS RELEASED,"We are not stupid and we will not stand for this. I have already spent almost TWO HUNDRED dollars on Fraggle Rock DVDS (the first 5 single disc collections) plus seasons 1, 2, and 3. HIT is just being greedy and stupid but their plan is going to backfire. I WILL NOT PAY OVER ONE HUNDRED DOLLARS JUST TO GET SEASON FOUR. HIT ENTERTAINMENT, RELEASE SEASON FOUR IMMEDIATELY."
1,Hit Entertainment Alienates its Fanbase,Let Hit Entertainment know that it isn't okay to exploit a show's fanbase. Boycott this product until they give season four a standalone release.
1,No Season Four? WTF?,"I don't write many reviews, and I really don't like posting a ""review"" before a product comes out, but HIT provides no easy way to give feedback on their website.I'm a big fan of Fraggle Rock and have been since I was a kid. I've bought all three seasons released so far, and I simply cannot understand why HIT isn't releasing a stand-alone season four instead of this ridiculous complete set. Way to milk the fans for every penny.It makes me sad because I really like the show, but there's no way I'm going to buy it a second time. Guess I'll just miss out on Season four.Please HIT, get on the ball with this and release a season four set. This is absolutely ridiculous. What were you thinking?Also, weren't there five seasons and 96 episodes of Fraggle Rock? Where did they combine seasons to make four sets anyway?"
2,Not worth the money........,"My grandchildren are HUGE Fraggle Rock fans, which makes me happy. However, this ""complete collection"" is a huge disappointment. The DVD quality looks like the 1,000th copy of the 1,000th copy. At LEAST 7 wouldn't play at all! Packaging is horrible with all just thrown loosely in a box; not what one expects for a ""collection"" of anything. EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTING, if not total ripoff. The only reason for a ""2"" is that SOME play...but even then not well.Amazon should drop this product/provider.Fraggle Rock: Complete Series Collection"
3,Season 4 details,"Just to let you guys know that Fraggle Rock Season 4 was released in Australia for 29.97 Australian dollars, so for you guys who have region free players you have that option."
1,Two Defective Sets = Refund,"First dvd set was defective. Replacement dvd set was also defective. Some of the discs did not play properly/skipped/screen blacked out. I was then issued a refund. If you order this product, please be advised to check that all the discs actually work before putting it away on your shelf."
5,Fraggle Rock,"The Fraggle Rock Collection was great! My grandson has watched all of them.He had not seen the original ones when they first played.Thank You,Norma Warren"
4,Worth it if you have not bought the seprate seasons,"I bought this for my wife for Christmas, since we did not have any of the season released before. I think it's worth it if you have not bought any of the seasons."
4,Love the Fraggles,"If you loved Fraggle Rock as a kid it's a must have. Share it with your kids they'll love it too. Downsides - if like every other Fraggle fan you already purchased Seasons 1 thru 3, you got hosed out of more money for stuff you already had. Bulky/oversized packaging makes it hard to store and you don't get all those cool sketch books you got with the season sets. Overall - I'm happy to have the whole series but pissed that they did it this way."
2,disappointed muppet fan,"Very disappointed that the production company would stoop to trickery to steal from would be fans. After faithfully collecting the first three seasons, we are forced to rebuy them to get season 4. In a word ""Diththpicable!"""
1,Great show - but get the newer complete set,"Recently, I was clearing my parents house out and found a box of old toys, including a bunch of Fraggle dolls that I had as a kid. When I mentioned this to my sister, she said she heard that Fraggles were making a comeback with a new movie coming out. Sure enough, when I checked Amazon, the complete series was available. It was such a joy to see this again. This is a great show for kids (or nostalgic adults). The puppetry is great. The show is very musical, but the songs (by and large) aren't corny or annoying. Some of them are actually a bit tender. The episodes often deal with themes like prejudice and the environment.That being said, I'd recommend getting the newerFraggle Rock: Complete Series CollectionDVD set. It has the complete series and is higher quality. For the price, it's a steal. I hope you enjoy your time ""down in Fraggle Rock""!"
5,Memories Revisited,"My children and I used to watch Jim Henson's Fraggle Rock in the early 1980's. Thanks for this publication of the complete work of the teachererly series containing lots of fun, color and personalities."
1,Giving me cause to whemble,"I could understand if it was next holiday season, but they seem to have skipped a step by not even releasing season 4 separately. Even if HIT is convinced to release a stand alone Season 4, I can guarantee that they will take away the bonus features that are included in the box set...and that Michael Frith poster map sounds really cool. What a predicament for the die hard fan... wemble, wemble..."
1,"Bad Form, HIT . . . Way to alienate your fans!","Lame.I, like so many other fans, purchased the first three seasons individually, and eagerly awaited the release of the forth. HIT, you screwed this one up for a lot of us . . . Shame on you. I wish I could give you ZERO stars.Entertaining your fans = FAIL"
3,"Packaging is Horrible, Show is Great!","As everyone said, the packaging IS terrible. Of the 20 DVDs, 9 were floating in the box upon its arrival today. Thankfully, none are scratched. The quality of the show seems just fine and I'm thrilled to have the complete series for my future children - and myself! The packaging is so crappy though... but, at $60, I'm OK with cruddy packaging. It'll do its job on the shelf, as long as it's kept out of little hands."
1,Bad Box Set Packaging- Discs fall out and come scratched:(,"One star because of the way the box set packaging is made- a folder paper holder and each page has two slots to hold discs... the bottom disc slides out and then gets scratched in shipment. Exactly half of all my discs have minor scratching from this- every bottom disc became loose during shipment. So beware if you are ordering this and it has to be shipped to you! But if you can buy it in a store and you don't hear any loose discs when gently handling the box, GO FOR IT. Its otherwise a decent set, as long as you take care to keep it in such a way so the discs don't fall out.. which could happen easily if not paying attention."
2,Fraggle Rock Season 2- Dvd problems,I love fraggle rock as a show and have been happy that all of the dvd's I've bought previously have worked. Recently I received Fraggle Rock the complete set Season 2. One of the Dvd's in that set would not play in any player. I wanted to share an email address to other customers who have had the same problem as myself. I have contacted Lionsgate customer service at: lionsgatecs@orderassistance.com to get help with the defective dvd problem.
1,Greed? or stupidity?,"I can't decide if it's greed or stupidity that's motivating HIT to forgo release of a stand alone edition Season 4 of Fraggle Rock. How much MORE money would they have made by releasing Season 4 ALONG WITH the complete box set? Compounded sales from the Complete Set for those who waited AND sales of Season 4 for those who supported all along. Win/Win? Instead they decide to create a situation where not only will they lose sales of the Complete Set because those of us who bought 1, 2 and 3 will not buy it, but they will lose future sales of the stand-alone Seasons 1, 2 and 3 if a Season 4 never sees the light of day. Sounds dumb to me. I would also consider dumping my Seasons 1, 2 and 3 on eBay, but who would buy them without a Season 4 to complete it?"
1,I wish there was an option for zero stars.,"I already bought the first three seasons, I can't believe I had to rebuy all of them to get season 4."
1,I Don't Think So HIT Entertainment!!!!,"Hit are nothing but a bunch of Con Artists! You are getting nothing from me, ever again...."
1,In Agreement,"I am a huge Muppet/Jim Henson fan - and was searching for the gift I wanted for Christmas. I do not have the previous seasons (just the grouped episode discs)- am wanting to get the whole set.I, however, am in total agreement with the majority of commentors - I will not buy the set becuase they seem to ignore the fan base and go for the quick buck (figuring that some previous buyers will decide to forget their 60-80 dollar investment and buy the set)What a shame - I was really looking forward to this set. Maybe I will go to ebay and start by buying the first three - by the time I am done, I may get a good bargain on this set so I can see the fourth..."
3,Eh.,"The first 2 seasons were AMAZING. how ever, all the discs from the final season freeze after the first 15 seconds."
1,Do not buy,"Fraggle Rock: Complete Series CollectionI grew up watching Fraggle Rock. For my fortieth birthday, my sister bought me this DVD collection. On the first DVD of Season 1, only the first two episodes played. I exchanged it. On the new set, the first DVD of Season 1, the fourth episode wouldn't play. I just got my third exchanged item. Same deal as the first one. The packaging is pathetic. I love Fraggles. But they have no clue how to pack this DVD collection."
1,"NEVER RECEIVED IT!!!! THEY'VE GOT MY MONEY,I'VE GOT NO PRODUCT!","NEVER RECEIVED THE ITEM - NO RESPONSE FORM THE SELLER - THEY'VE GOT MY MONEY, I'VE GOT NO PRODUCT. GRANDKIDS DON'T LIKE INVISIBLE CHRISTMAS GIFTS."
5,Fraggle Rock: The complete series collection,This is timeless and so wonderful for children (and their parents too). A wonderful series that I wish was on TV. My grandson loves it.
3,Which Version,"Is there a way to tell the difference between the American version and the British version. I've seen both, and the British version was a lot better!Thank You"
1,I'm with you guys!,"I haven't bought ANY of the Fraggle Rock DVD's yet, so I'm glad I saw these reviews first. I guess maybe it's cheating to write a review of something I don't have, so this one star is for the way this company handled Fraggle Rock on DVD, not for Fraggle Rock itself.I was thinking maybe I should go ahead and buy this set since I don't have any Fraggle Rock yet, but the reviews saying this boxed set sucks as far as packaging, extras, etc. go has convinced me I'd be better off to buy seasons 1-3 separately, and get season 4 from Australia (I have a region-free DVD player). Buying it one season at a time is easier on my budget anyway.Be sure to leave good reviews for the individual seasons so people know it's not the show itself that you have a problem with, but this specific boxed set. I grew up with shows like Sesame Street and Fraggle Rock, and Jim Henson rules!"
1,This is not what Jim Henson was about,"HIT Entertainment has chosen to only release season four of Fraggle Rock in this boxed set. As someone who already bought seasons 1, 2, and 3 separately, I find it appalling for a company to ONLY release season 4 in the form of this set. Rebuying three seasons in order to get ONE season is disgusting. Shame on HIT Entertainment for shunning fans' wishes and trying to make a lousy buck.AVOID AT ALL COSTS."
2,HORRIBLE!!!,"This is terrible!!! I too, already own the first three seasons. In fact i was awaiting each release date with such anticipation, and then would eagerly have it by christmas. But now, they are telling me that i cant do the same with season four??? I have to REBUY the seasons i already own in a box set in order to get the fourth?!?!?!That is outrageous!!! Its corporate greed and its not fair for those fans who have remained so loyal over the years. I can't help but think that if Jim Henson were still alive, that he would be disgusted with such actions. I agree with others before me who said, that they wont buy this box set, unless they get 100 dollars off, for turning in the 3 previous seasons with their purchase.This is a Horrible thing for HIT to do. I know they want to make money, but this is rediculous. Not to mention its a total waste of packaging and resources. Yep, Jim Henson is probably rolling in his grave right now. So much for everything he and his beloved fraggles stood for..."
1,Where's Season 4?,"I have to agree with the general sentiment of the other reviewers in being disgusted with HIT's greed over this release. I adore Fraggle Rock and have faithfully bought the 1st 3 seasons every year since 2005. I was looking foward to completing the collection with Season 4 this year, only to find they're not releasing it, but instead are forcing their loyal fans and customers to re-purchase the 1st 3 seasons to get #4 in this box set. No way I'm going to spend $100 to rebuy DVDs I already have. Looks like I'll have to miss out on the finale of my favorite childhood show."
1,A TOTALLY Raw deal!,"To get season 4 I will have to buy the first 3 again! Hit Ent. should release season 4 alone, or buy back the soon to be useless disks I already have.Is Amazon going to do anything about this??"
1,BOYCOTT! What a Disgusting Thing for Fraggle Rock Fans to Have to Endure.,"I can't believe it. Fans wait patiently for the final, perhaps most creative season of Fraggle Rock, only to discover that they are unable to purchase it unless they buy 3 DVD sets they already have. I refuse to buy this set and if I never see some of my favorite episodes, oh well, I will not succumb to greed."
1,Making Headway,"I think all the fans(myself included) are sending a good message to HIT, judging from the current sales rank of this series set on Amazon. I'm sure if they'd put out the 4th season as a stand-alone, this set would have a sales rank in the top 100. Yet right now, it's not even breaking 1,000. You can take what you want from the fact that it's being offered at nearly 50% off as well. Keep it up, fans."
1,Disgraceful!,No stand alone season 4? boilerplate responses that ignore the questions being asked to fans inquiries? O got some friends above ground waiting for the people that made this horrible greedy decision.
5,Love it,It is so fun to watch a little Fraggle Rock on a cold snowy weekend! It's a must watch at my house.
5,Fraggle Rock!,"I watched Fraggle Rock with my son when it first aired and we couldn't wait til the next episode!! Now, with these DVD's, I am watching Fraggle Rock with my granddaughter. She wants to watch 5 and 6 episodes at a time. Time has not diminished its appeal!! Fraggle Rock ROCKS!!"
2,Great series if only all the DVD's worked,"I purchased the series for my daughter as I loved the series growing up. I received the video's and attempted to play the first disc only to receive errors and skipping. I tried another DVD player, same issue. I returned the series for a replacement set only to discover the same thing. I see a review on September 25th that had the same issues so there must be a bad lot. Without the play back issues, it would be a 5."
5,brings back memories,"i have seasons final and first,but i would love to haave the complete series for my birthday. or christmas with the movie coming out,i only needed 2 and 3rd season."
1,"Fraggle Rock is totally rockin', which is why we need a separate Season 4 release!","I'll keep it short: refusing a separate season 4 release is just plain stupid. You succeed only in making enemies. Please, grace us with a Season 4 box."
1,"Horrible Packaging, bad deal.","I had held off buying the other releases to wait for a good deal on the complete series, and I wished that I had waited longer for them to release season 4 instead.the packaging is awful, when it arrived ALL of the disks were flying around loose, 13 of the 20 are BADLY scratched and several wont play - now I have to see if I can get any of the disks replaced or send the whole thing back.aside from that the box is bigger than necessary and devoid of any interesting features - its just a box with a sculpted logo on one side and a ""map"" and a list of episode titles on the inside.don't buy this, they are going to have to release the 4th season eventually."
1,Add my name to the no sale list,I simply refuse to support such greed. The internet has ways around such things. And companies wonder why piracy is so rampant.***EDIT***I wound up purchasing this set since I found people to gift my old sets... I truly wish I hadn't. The packaging is HORRID!13 of the 20 discs were floating free in the box. This will happen with nearly every set as the design has no way to lock the discs into notebook-style sleeves.There are also no nifty trinkets such as Henson's notebook & pitchbook as found in 1 & 2 and Frith's sketches in set 3. There is a basic map of Fraggle Rock.... big deal.For those being tempted to give away their old sets to pick this up... DON'T!!!
4,Fraggles,"Packaging needs just a bit more attention. When we received this product 2 out of the 4 individually packaged sets of DVD's were rattling. Fortunately it was only the bonus DVD's in those 2 boxes that were slidding around getting scratched. The other 2 were packaged with obvious care, given the foam insert that prevent the discs from slipping free and becoming scratched. No other issues with this product and I look forward to watching the DVD's with my son.Thank you!"
1,YUCK,Another review here saying DO NOT BUY THIS. Horrible packaging renders all its discs damaged and scratched. Save yourself a lot of trouble by buying seasons 1-3 separately and just wait for Season 4. I'm sure it'll come out eventually.
1,Pros: You get Season 4 Cons: The box is so bad you probably cannot watch Season 4.,"As if it wasn't bad enough that HIT decides to try to milk fans who already have Seasons 1-3 by only releasing Season 4 in the complete set, but the set sucks. It's poor design is right up there with the complete Stargate collection SG-1. You won't get a set that isn't scratched. Do yourself a favor and order from Australia. You'll save yourself a lot grief. Hopefully Amazon doesn't have to pay for all the returns they are sure to get for this set."
5,Remember the old days,"This is realy great! We can't find anything like this anymore on television! Great content to show to your kids! =PThe new cases for the dvd's is great, Came with all seasons in one case!Realy great!!!!"
5,great knife,This knife is a great value for the money. I use it on a daily basis and it holds up very well plus its big enough to get the job done but it still fits well in your pocket. The finish on the knife looks great and is easy to keep clean. I love the fact that Case knives are American made as well.
3,Disappointing,"George Mikes' _How to be an Alien_ is one of my favourite books, so when I saw _How to be Decadent_ in one of my local used bookstores, I bought it without even paging through. I don't regret the decision (after all, it only cost $2), but it was a big disappointment after _Alien_. It's along the same lines - unconnected vignettes of observation poking gentle fun at the English - but just doesn't have the same spark. For Mikes fans only, I would say."
5,Some of the Nicest Music Unknow to the West,"After watching Chunking Express, I became interested in actress Faye Wong and found out she has been much more noted in her country and region as a singer than as an actress. I purchased a couple of her cd's and really enjoyed them. Even though I don't know the language, music is universal and the songs are catchy. I searched on-line for a consensus of what might be considered the best of her many cd's, and Chang You was most frequently mentioned. I ordered it through Amazon, and have been enjoying it ever since. Highly recommended."
3,"Nice, But...",My husband bought these for me and I never took them out- they were for my 'second holes'. I loved them until I accidentally hooked my fingernail on one of them while washing my hair. The backing popped off and the earring went down the drain before I could retrieve it. It seems to me that for the price of these earrings the manufacturer could have made locking backings so they're not easily lost.
3,Good-but not tops for Phil,"Phil is awesome--maybe the best guitar player ever. This album, however, is well crafted and performed pop--nothing wrong with that, but I don't find myself going back to it often--and his guitar work is very understated. That shows how amazingly ego-less this guy is, but doesn't address the needs of my jones : ). For his albums with bands and lyrics (how many artists do you have to make that distinction about?), I like Crimson & Blue and Find Me In These Fields better."
5,What a find!,"I just got home from a Phil Keaggy concert and was blown away by his talent and guitar virtuosity. Every word I think of to describe him seems like an understatement. His CDs can never replicate what you see and hear live. But once you've seen him in concert, it makes experience of listening to the CDs that much richer. I would recommend this CD, especially if you are new to Phil's work, although I can't say it's better than his others (they are all so good!). ""Premium Jams"" - a new release - is a must-have if you enjoy his rockin' electric guitar style."
5,This IS His Time,"Gerald Stern's book of poems demonstrates it IS his time. The selected poems cover Stern's past up to present, suspending images and thought, passing a range of emotions that then rise from within the reader. I have read and continue to re-read this collection, hear G.S.'s matter-of-fact voice lifting from pages, see his impressions as clearly as if I were seeing them with my own eyes. This is a book I take along on trips or vacations or sudden moves. If you know Gerald Stern, you'll love THIS TIME; if you don't know Stern, you'll love him before finishing only five of his poems. Lovely, lovely... and thought provoking."
3,not the best halloween book out there,"It's Saturday Night and all the rich and famous beast in New Orleans gather at the Beastro for good food and fun. Some of the famous dishes served there are Free Range FireFlies, Worm Souffe', and Lizard cookies!The story didn't flow very well. Lots of the rhyming test seemed forced.This book would be on okay book to read around Halloween due to the pictures of ""beast"". There are better choices out there in our opinion."
4,Well executed review of Dali with new or refreshing ways to view him.,An insightful look at Dali's life including his later years as captured on video with details of his larger than life Dali Museum.
3,Too short and inconsistent,It started off very good describing how Salvador Dali was influenced by science and psychoanalysis. Then about half way through it lost its focus. The documentary did not show enough of Dali's work during the documentary. He did more than just paintings. He did theater sets and art movies.
3,Not exceptable,"I was very disappointed with this product because all of theese parts are exposed to water,wether it be condensation or fish splashing about or humidity.There for allthe components rot away very rapidly,I have even kept the water levels lower and this does no good.If this problem could be solved perhaps then they would be worth the money!G.Ogden"
4,Great,The only problem I had was that it does not come with a light. The pinch outs for the filter and the heater both worked fine. Fit my 5 gallon tank perfectly. Happy customer.
2,Its cheap.,Bought this lid because it was cheap and its basically what you pay for. The little cover to feed your fish is very tiny you have to remove the whole lid every time you want to change something in the tank. The little plastic piece that covers the light bulbs sucks. The lights died after a month cause of the water splashing up. I tried putting in new bulbs and waiting for it to dry first it still doesn't work. The plastic on the back is really hard to remove when you have to put the filer and all your other stuff in. I feel like if i were to get a lid in which the lighting systems sucks why wouldn't i just pay for the nice glass canopy instead of this cheap plastic one.
1,Too small,"I ordered this hood for my basic 5 gallon tank. Unfortunately, it is too small and falls into the tank. I should have spent the money for the nicer one that I saw online, but thought this one would fit."
1,Horrible rash-making soap,"I had a horrible allergic reaction to this soap. It took a few days for it to really build up, but when it did, the itching was unbelievable. The rash came after that. Sooo, I don't really recommend it. Except maybe as a gift for your worst enemy."
1,caustic,"I had bought the chamomile version of this soap a year ago and liked it very much. I recently bought the fragrance free pure olive oil soap. It was a lot ""greener"" than the first bar I had purchased. This stuff is caustic. It is very drying and irritating to the skin, very unlike my previous experience with the product. I feel as if the soap was not properly cured leaving some of the lye viable, I don't know. But the product is unusable."
3,"First bar was great--second one, not so much","The first bar of this soap was great for my skin and I used it without incident. I wasn't so lucky on the second bar, as it made every inch of my body itch for days! I couldn't get rid of it quick enough after I figured out that it was the culprit. Needless to say, there won't be any more of this in my house."
4,Pleasing delicate fragrance,Kiss My Face Soap: The soap has a pleasing delicate fragrance but I was surprised by the dark green/brown color of the soap and the fact it was longer and thinner than the average bar of soap.
4,good soap,"smells really good, but it gets really mushy; you need a REALLY good soap dish for this one."
2,Love the product,But took 3 weeks to receive it.. I pretty much forgot that I had ordered it. This is my favorite face soap
1,Dry skin and a rash,"I used this soap about four year ago and broke out in a rash on my legs and arms. Recently, I mistakenly used the soap again for a few days and now the rash is back. I don't know which ingredient I'm reacting too. I've read several other accounts of people who had a similar reaction. Makes me wonder if they use an undisclosed chemical in the processing."
1,this product does not work for blackberry 8700,amazon says it works for blackberry 8700 but in reality it doesnt. when i received this product it doesnot mention anywhere that it works for 8700.
3,All you really need is a personality,"This is a collection of rare tracks produced by Jerry Kasenetz and Jeff Katz. Kasenetz and Katz (aka Super K Productions) are best known as the creators of bubblegum music. None of the songs featured here were hits, and all of them are extremely rare. The quality of the material varies, but all of them are at least somewhat interesting. Not all of the songs are bubblegum, although a lot of them are. My personal favorites are the John Lennon-influenced ""Elevator Man"", the soft and compelling ""The Clock"" and the West Indian/calypso-influenced ""Mama Lu"". Recommended to fans of bubblegum music."
1,Not a Keeper,"I purchased this series on the wonderful reviews received on Amazon. BUT, I did not like this book. It was short, so I finished it. Diamond is not a likeable character. She is very sterotypical--the extreme tomboy---'I won't cry, Pa wouldn't be proud'--know what I mean? She went from I want to KILL you (literally) to I can't live without you a little fast. And the way she blamed a man for her father's death without any proof made me really dislike her. Sorry, but I can't agree with the other review--"
3,Not bad but a bit overpriced,All the items are quite useful. the best item is the cloth for the screenThe sleeve is a tight fit and a bit awkward to put onBuy at a discounted price - the normal retail price is too high.
4,Very Best of Burt Bacharach,"This CD is the very best, very enjoyable and easy to listen to. I highly recommend it for anyone who enjoyed good '70s classic music."
5,Realy the very BEST,Top singers with the best songs.This CD must be in the Music History and for every age and moments
2,If you live in large city DO NOT buy this,"I bought this as a present for my wife but its VERY staticy and singnal is not strong. Our problem is that we live in Dallas and theer is no spot on the radio that doesnt have some type fo signal coming though. Also, the dial on the transmitter doesnt go low enough (stops at 89.9 I think) to get any totally dead air. I wouldnt recommend this."
4,"Clearly, the best so far","This is definitely the best FM transmitter I have ever heard for my iPod. It transmits with a strong frequency that seems to overpower most (bot not all) other ""noise"" on a particular station setting. Very easy to operate - just plug it in, pick a station, and press play. The sound is very clear and with a little adjusting on my car's audio controlls (bass and treble) I can get the sound just how I like it. Definitely worth the purchase!"
1,kennsingto IPOD transmitter,I am very disappointed in this item. Although it does allow you to tune into any station it never tunes in or transmits strong enough to provide a clear signal. I would strongly discourage purchasing this item.
1,Try a Different Brand,I tried every station that was not broadcasting and I either heard a popping noise or the sound was ok but only came out of the left side of the stereo. There was no sound from the right speakers at all. A friend tried it in their vehicle and it had poor quality there as well.
4,Quick Cartunes,"This is a quick, efficient way to get your iPod music on your car stereo at minimal cost and with minimal hassle. As long as you can find a blank FM station, the sound fidelity is just fine for in the car. My only complaint is that the digital readout of the radio station frequency is hard to read if the unit comes out of your cigarette lighter port horizontally. The illuminated numbers blend in with the background numbers, making it difficult to set the unit, especially while driving."
4,"Solid Product, Some Flaws","This is my 2nd FM transmitter for an iPod. The Kensington Digital FM Transmitter is much better signal wise than my previous one. I only have a few gripes with it. The first is that it pops out of my car power outlet very easily. I realize this differs with cars though. There are only three presets when most other FM transmitters have four. However, this is not a huge issue since I only use one preset. My last gripe is more of a personal preference. I like the FM transmitters that are stationary better, not the kind that are a cord. My iPod ends up moving around a lot as a drive and dropping on the floor sometimes."
2,Be aware this does not fit in utility outlet,"I had high hopes for this product when I ordered it. However, it does not fit in the utility outlet for a 1999 Honda Accord. It is too narrow and too long. So pass this by if you have a utility outlet in your car that is shorter and wider than a cigarette lighter."
2,disappointed,"I was a little disappointed with this item, there is too much static I have yet to hear one song without static, and the volume doesn't come through very loud."
3,I was hopeful,"Unless your car lighter is at eye level, you can't see the display. Did Kensington even bother to test this in a car?? Every time I hit a bump, it pauses. This doesn't happen with other transmitters that I have tried. I think if the charger locked, maybe it would help. It seems to come loose quite often. I have tried so many of these things and have accepted that there is no perfect transmitter. Even with it's obvious flaws, the Kensington is the one that I have settled on."
2,"Poor sound quality, and doesnot charge Ipod","I have an Ipod nano 4gb. Took it to Yellowstone along with ""Kensington 33199 Digital FM Transmitter and Auto Charger for iPod"". The audio file quality had to be at its best (>128kbps?) to keep the unwanted noise down. At high volume there is a background buzz which you may not notice on freeway. I tried all the frequencies. The problems stated above were found on best frequencies.The frequency display LED is unreadable. Very narrow angle of view.To top it all the equipment would not charge my iPod. My not fully charged iPod died in 3 hrs. I am sending it back to Amazon for refund. It can possibly be a defective copy but I will not give it a second chance.They should come up with a Hi def FM transmitter.By the way, Amazon prime rocks."
3,Mediocre audio quality,"Although this FM transmitter is among the best non-wired transmitters, it still falls short in the audio quality department. Normal FM radio stations still sound better in my car. It has a problem with the ""S"" sounds sounding sibilant and reception still isn't perfect.If you are particular about sound quality, you should look into other options for integrating your iPod into your car stereo."
2,The unit was defective,"The unit did not turn on when connected to the car lighter. After checking on different cars, I concluded that the unit was defective.I returned it and received a new one in a short time.The new one worked fine. In general, the sound is good, although I am able to hear some noise (little) when there is a gap between songs."
3,fuzzy,"the transmitter works great, unless you are driving thru any type of metropolitan area, then there is interference on any channel that you choose and it sounds like you are listening to a book with static in the background. in other areas the transmitter works great!"
1,Piece of JUNK !!!!!!!,"Worked great for about 2 weeks. Then it quit, my husband found the fuse was blown and put a new fuse in. Right away it blew the new fuse out. Obviously there is a short in it some where. A lot of money for something that was only going to work for such a short time."
4,great functionality!,"i found this product easy to use and it made life in my car a breeze. suddenly i am surrounded by music and podcasts and everything is fine! unfortately the design was poor for me. the lighter/charger segment that reads the radio signal on it fits right by the gear shifter in my 96 VW. therefore every time i switched gears i would tap it out and the music would stop. a loud BUZZ of static ensued. in addition, because of that design i cannot see the station to reset it while driving. ideally if it gets knocked out of the lighter case i have to pull over and bend my head down to reset the station on teh transmitter. very difficult maneuver. i now have a new one that is designed so that you can look at the road and at the station on the transmitter without risking your life. big improvment! both would go off randomly though :-( better than NO transmitter."
2,Maybe it's me...,"but i have no luck with these fm transmitters. Finally hardwired my ipod to my F-150. Who knows, it seems as if some auto makers have stronger antennas that allow these to work better then others but for me, I can't do the fm route. Too much interference and on long drives you might have to hunt for 5 or 6 different stations to use. Bah Humbug!"
3,If you never listen to the radio do not buy this...,"Im the type of person who likes the sound quality of music. I never listen to the radio because I cannot stand static even the littlest bit. Supposedly this is the best you can buy so the fact that it sounds like your listening to the radio makes me think its just a better idea to go buy a head unit with an ipod plug in because the amount of static and station changing is beyond annoying for me. If you dont mind a little static with your music, by all means go ahead and buy. Its not unbearable amounts of static, but its enough for me to hardly ever use this product because of the hurt music quality."
1,too much interference,"I tried using this accessory with my ipod but the sound quality was horrible. Tons of interference and static with no bass at all. I switched to a direct connection with my car stereo and it is 100% better. If your car stereo has a compatible connection, I recommend using it rather than wasting your money on this type of product."
1,Just doesn't do the job.,We live in the Los Angeles area. It's simply impossible to find any stations that are free of interference for more than a few miles. Returned this unit -- with kudos to Amazon for making that process so easy. Bought the Sony iPod cassette adapter. Absolutely perfect -- and about a quarter of the price.
1,"""STAY FAR AWAY""","OK I BOUGHT THIS FOR MY NEW 2008 AUDI THAT HAS A FACTORY INSTALLED PORT FOR THE I-POD, BUT THE VOLUME IS NOT SO GREAT GO FIGURE A 50K CAR AND CAN NOT GET GREAT SOUND FROM BOSE SYSTEM- ANYWAY BACK TO THE PRODUCT I TRIED IT AND ITS GARBAGE REASON 1 WITH SUCH A GREAT SOUND SYSTEM I COULD FIND A FM STATION NOT BLANK MEANING EVERYTIME I SET THE BLANK STATON MY UNIT WOULD PICK UP THE NEXT BEST SINGLE (I LIVE IN FLORIDA- FYI)SO IF YOU HAVE AN OLDER CAR TRY IT- IF NOT STAY AWAY FARRRRRR AWAY!!"
1,did not fit cigarette lighter,"this transmitter looked and felt like cheap, but worse, the adapter did not fit into my Honda cigarette lighter! I returned it and bought the DLO TransDock which works great."
1,Bad Adapter,"I didn't have an opprotunity to use my fm transmitter because the adapter was too large for the power outlet in my car. There was no way for me to use it unless I bought another adapter which was going to be another 20 dollars. I didn't realize that the adapters came in different sizes, I'll know to look next time!! Amazon was great taking it back though. I ended up buying the Belkin adapter. It was great. It has clear channels, fits my power outlet, and comes with all the adapters for both the ipod and charger that you could think of. I have 2nd generation nano and it fits perfectly.No shaking, no coming loose. I really like it, and the sound is great!! Clear as a bell! I also really enjoy having my ipod charged while I listen to it."
1,broke for no reason,this transmitter worked well for a little while but it was cheap and broke for no reason. i pulled it out of the car adapter and it literally fell apart and couldn't be fixed. sort of a waste of money.
2,Not quite that great,Hmmm unless you're magical and can find an empty station with no static really isn't worth it.
4,Should be 4.5 stars!,"This product works BEAUTIFULLY and exactly as advertised. Sound quality is just a hair below FM broadcast quality, but you can only hear this if you're in the car by yourself and have the music cranked.I see no reason to pay hundreds for a ""built in"" iPod link or Bluetooth design. This is more than fine.Purchase a small zipper bag so you can keep your iPod and Kensington together, to transfer from car to car."
4,Best of the FM transmitters for your iPod,"I have tried two other FM transmitters for my iPod, and this one has proven to work the best. It includes enough frequencies that you shouldn't have any problem finding a clear channel (the lower 80's channels are poor in my area because of all the talk stations, but the high end of the dial works quite well).The only thing I don't like about this transmitter is that it is nearly impossible to see when it is plugged in. The angle of the LCD is good if you're standing on your head since it is about even with the top of your seat. Also, the orange back-lighting makes reading the numbers on the display quite difficult.If I were making one of these, I would tilt the display so it faces up, and I would use either LEDs or an LCD display where the numbers light up instead of back-lighting.I'm still giving this unit 4 stars because the sound quality is really what it is all about, and it does well in that area."
4,Great for the Money,"This little transmitter has worked well with my 30G IPOD. I found a station on the FM channel that works, and it stayed good for a 3-hour trip I often make. I haven't taken it farther than that. The sound and clarity are excellent. The only complaint I have is that you can barely read the numbers on the display. They all look the same and so you can't tell if you have the same station as your radio indicates or not. It's also difficult to tell if you've saved it correctly. I found the station on my car's radio and saved it; then I kept pushing the up button on the transmitter until the static stopped. That did it. Maybe luck. But the bottom line is: it works!"
4,great product,i admit i haven't tried the others...but this is great...i live in the Philadelphia area and it works great...does work a little better just outside downtown areas...but all around easy to use and super clear frequencies.
2,Static,"It might be my area, but this thing is my $55 charger now. The feedback was terrible. 4 mile stretch in my daily commute (in a metro area, not the sticks somewhere) it was nothing but white noise. I can't use it at all. I would trade it for an MP3 car charger and get something else."
1,not compatible,"Just as a heads up-I drive a 97 Pontiac Grand Am and thought this would be the perfect solution for playing my ipod since I don't have a tape player. The problem: my cigarette lighter isn't compatible with the charger that comes with the transmitter, that might have been nice to know before I bought it. Does anyone drive a similar car and have a transmitter/charger that is adaptable?"
4,FM Transmitter for iPod,"This works well as long as you're not in town where there are a lot of radio station. I did get some static depending on where I'm driving. There are two things I don't like about it. The first one is that when I plugged the transmitter into my cigarette lighter, it's hard to see the number of the station. I wish that part is adjustable or something so you can turn it to where you can read the station. The second thing I don't like is that it's hard to plug it into my cigarette lighter (I have an MDX). Overall, it charges my iPod well and is compact."
4,worth the $,I had a inexpensive Belkin prior to buying this that wasn't worth the few dollars I paid for it. The Kensington has been a major improvement over that. I've used it in different parts of the country and as long as you are willing to occasionally find new FM stations it work's fine. Easy to use too.
3,Got the job done,"When the transmitter worked, it worked well. We made a trip up the east coast with it, and the biggest problem we had was that it was hard to read the digital screen. Partly this is due the location of our adapter plug nevertheless it was difficult to see what channel we were on. Since we were constantly needing to move to a new frequency, there was some frustration over this."
4,Fair performance for the price,"For this type of low signal transmitter, the unit performs reasonably well. If it is practical, I would recommend one of the units that actually is hardwired into the car's audio system."
4,It's good.,It works best when the rest of the world is sleeping & radio stations are tuned out. It does what it says it will. I like it.
4,Nice Product,"I had this up and running in a couple of minutes with no problem.I commute in a rural area and have very few issues with static. I've basically only run it on one station.The main area for improvement is the display with is difficult to read. If I were having to search for clear stations, I would find this frustrating."
4,I-Pod FM Transmitter,"It took a bit to find true dead FM frequencies in the Denver area, but once they were set, the system works very will with my I-Pod. I like the free wire connection as my Cad had unusual angles on the cig. lighter and the units on a flex stand would not work. I am into audio books and the system works great."
4,Good,I live in pasadena and we have a lot of radio stations in the area.I tuned my transmitter at 87.9 but do experience some interference at times in the pasadena area and also outside from other radio stations.The sound quality is very good and is a hassle free device.
2,Fine for a charger,"I live in a big city (DFW) and the static on any channel is too great. Some reviewers wrote that this is not an issue with this unit, but it is! This product is only useful as a charger."
3,"Sometimes great, sometimes static","Since this is a brand new type of product I can't really compare it to others. Sometimes the sound is great, other times there's too much static, even when you switch stations."
3,alright for 1 year..,"I thought it was great when I first got it, the ease of having to push a button and it moves to another set station if it starts to get static. It worked great up until the past couple of months. The charger piece where you plug it into your ipod has been very finicky and the sound cuts out if the wire is moved or touched the wrong way. I am looking for a new adaptor. I think I paid around $50, and it has lasted me one year. Buy it if you want, but beware that the wire may give out after a little while and you may have to cradle it in your lap as you drive to be able to listen to your music without it getting cut out and sound like the singer is in a cave!"
4,Transmisor FM,"Considero que es bastante desente, a veces se ele mete un poco de ruido , pero puede ser del sistema de alta tensión del vehículo ( cables de candela o tapa de distribusión)En general, funciona adecuadamente."
3,Didn't fit,"I'm sure this product may work quite nicely. I bought it for my boyfriend for Christmas, however it did not fit into his cigarette lighter output of the car, all 3 of them in his car. He has a Nissan Frontier. So unfortunately we did not find out how well it does or does not work. Make sure to check the size. And then we lost a part when we opened it, so unfortunately can't return it.Better luck to you!"
1,THIS PRODUCT IS TERRIBLE,"I purhcased this item as a result of all the 'Positive"" reveiws on the site. After plugging in the transmitter, yes I heard music through my iPod but also heard loud fuzzy ""white"" noise in the background, so unpleasant to listen to.. the company I purchased it from (PCTechsystems) on Amazon would not refund -"
3,"OK performance, mediocre sound","This product works as advertised. You can listen to your iPod through your care stereo. However, the sound is not very good and at least to me it does not provide adequate fidelity to be enjoyable. There is also the problem with FM interference as you drive from one place to another but this is to be expected with this technology."
3,No Better Than Others,"This product is O.K. I have used other FM adapters, and this product works no better than many others on the market. The bottom line is this: If you are in an area with a multitude of FM stations, you are in trouble becuase it will be difficult to find a setting that can consistently transmit your music or podcasts without interference."
4,Acceptably good sound.,"I live in the Chicago area and have had very few problems with the unit. I have found that if there is slight static at the predetermined frequency, it usually goes away with a little bit of tuning. Overall I am very pleased with the sound quality without having to pay through the nose."
4,Product itself is good,As many people were saying it's almost impossible to find frequency without static. I live in Bay area and here quality of sound is far from good. The only reason I give 4 stars because device itself is of good quality.
4,Great product!,"This product works fantastically! Its so much better than the others i have tried, including the wireless type made by other companies. Of course when you get an ipod playing kit installed in your car it will sound better, but this is a great alternative to getting something so expensive done. I loved it so much I bought my sister and brother one."
4,Poor Lighting,This device charges as well as transmit the FM signals to the radio. It works quite well. The only downside to the product is that the display is somewhat hard to read. There is not a dimmer button to control the background lighting which makes it very hard to see the numbers.
2,Doesn't compare to a cassette adapter,"I recently upgraded my car to a 2004 Camry which does not have a cassette deck. Too bad, because this FM Transmitter is barely OK for listening to podcasts and no good at all for music. Hi trebles cause the static level to fade in and out, making for an annoying sound.Why is it so hard to make these work?Not recommended."
4,"Great transmitter, great price","I had purchased the Belkin transmitter and it didn't work very well. So by comparison, this one is just great. Easy to use and good reception, even in the Dallas area."
2,Works with limitations.,"For the most part this product works but it has some limitations. No matter how much searching you do be prepared to here some static noise while using this product on the road. You're safe for short trips but past 15 or 20 miles you will probably need to switch stations. I literally have a station for home, work and school. Make sure you memorize those stations and there position on the device because the lcd is practically impossible to read when connected to standard cigarette/ power socket. If you happen to still have a tape deck in your car use one of those cassette tape adapters that has a mini plug attached to it. If your car stereo has a mini plug or audio rca input that's even better. Otherwise this product is nothing more than acceptable."
5,Great product--works as advertised,"This transmitter/charger has been great for my commute to and from work--after a few glitches trying to find a clear frequency (i.e. no competing radio stations), the reception has been fantastic, and of course you never have to worry about your iPod running out of power. One oddity: the transmitter allows you to pick even numbered frequencies (e.g. 107.2 rather than 107.1), which I imagine could be useful since no FM stations broadcast on those frequencies, but most car radios I've seen don't have the ability to receive these ""between"" frequencies. Well worth the money.UPDATE: Got another one of these for my wife's car, and the new unit will only broadcast on ""odd"" frequencies (i.e. 89.1, 89.3, etc). This saves some scrolling if you're trying to pick out a new frequency to broadcast from."
1,Sound Not So Great,"Product was very simple to use and set up. Sound however was less that stellar - certain sounds such as hard ""s"" and ""ch"" were distorted when being played through the transmitter. Only for those WITHOUT an ear for good sound."
4,Kensington 33199 Digital FM Transmitter,"Overall, I am quite pleased with the purchase. The reception is usually quite good. The only problem is with the display. In daylight, it is quite hard to read the display. Also, if your power source is in an inconvenient location, it is near impossible to read the station."
5,Kensington Digital FM Transmitter for iPod,"It sounds great through the BOSE car stereo system, and I really like the compact size. I only got to use it once and then my son absconded with it. He had a gigantic cumberson old one and he raves about the Kinsington. I guess I'll be ordering another one for myself in the near future..."
3,could be better,"Hard to read display when not looking straight on, could have been designed better. Bought the belkin one for the wife and would consider that one better due to ease of use."
4,Kensington 33199 Digital FM Transmitter and Auto Charger for iPod,"These devices are always a bit tricky, especially finding the right station that wont cause static. Every brand has problems though, I have actually found this brand to be the best. The only drawback to this one as opposed to some other brands is this one doesn't come with a stand, I have to leave my i-pod upside down in my cup holder."
4,Pretty good transmitter,I bought this transmitter for my fiance to use her iPod in here Scion Xb. Overall the sound is better than two of the other transmitters I have used before but it is still not as good as having a direct input from the iPod to the car stereo. The one minor complain I have is the the radio station display as at an angle that is tough to read if the cigarette lighter is low. I would recommmend this product if you are unable to afford a CD deck with an input.
2,Can't read the screen ...,"This product does what it is supposed to do, which is transmit the songs clearly, BUT, the LCD which prints the station it is tuned to is not readable from any angle other than direct. I have two plugs in my car for the unit to plug into, and neither is a straight line from the drivers line of vision, which means I have to twist my head around (and in the case with one of the power adapters, lay my head on the seat) to read what it is saying on the LCD.2 stars for have decent FM transmit functionality, but using a cheap LCD for programming it."
5,Highly Recommended Item,"I live in the Phoenix area and use this transmitter for my iPod Video. It works absolutely great. I have not gone out of town with it, so, don't have any experience on the road, but, in town, it's great. Clear sound and no cutting out. I would highly recommend this product."
3,so so,"haven't had a chance to try it outside the city, but in Boston the reception is not very good (maybe cause it's hard to find a non-occupied frequency)"
2,Less Than Stellar,"I was willing to accept that sometimes it is difficult to find a clear frequency to tune to for the best sound, and I did get quite a bit of use from this device for nearly three years. However, the cable began to work loose from the housing almost as soon as I got it, and I have now given it up as trash since my iPod as been freezing up when I try to use the transmitter. Some might think that I should be happy with the three years of use, but I do hope for better construction."
3,GREAT OLD SCHOOL CD,"HEY I ONLY WONDER WHERE DID BIG DADDY GO? HE WAS THE PLAYER OF SMOOTH RAP,POETRY AND DANCE TOON'S FOR HIS TIME, NOT A MUST HAVE BUT STILL GOOD LISTENING."
4,Effective. Contains aluminium.,"This deodorant is effective, I've used both the scented and fragrance-free varieties. But if you make the choice of avoiding aluminium in your deodorant for whatever reason, don't let the list of ingredients fool you. The clay ingredient, kaolin, with the chemical formula Al2-Si2-O5(OH)4, is a mineral containing aluminium. While this compound may not have been added to plug up sweat glands, like the way aluminium-chloride or aluminium-zirconium compounds work in 'true' anti-perspirants, merely advertising the product as containing ""clay"" is a misleading way of reporting the ingredients in my opinion."
5,Water Walkers are Special People,Most of us stay in the boat and at 65 if we have kept it in good enough shape can retire. Walking on water means getting out of the boat and making a difference for others.
2,A guide,I really enjoyed reading the book. This is a little weak for me. But I have also heard people talk very highly of it.The DVD was super weak and seemed like it was rehearsed (ok it didnt seem I think they even had the laugh sign they would wave for the people).
3,Good Directions - Limited Projects,"Very detailed directions for all sorts of netting; if you can't learn from this book, you won't learn at all. However, there are only a few specific projects included so you need to be able to take the basics from this book and use your own imagination and creativity to actually produce jewelry, home decor objects and the like. The photos of netted objects from all cultures are facinating; there is even a netted window valance!"
3,Maybe Nets Aren't My Thing,"The book is fine, I just get frustrated when I have difficulty with the techniques."
5,....and Diane Does it Again,"This is another of Diane's excellent teaching books. She is so thorough with her instructions that anyone who can thread and hold an needle can BEAD. The projects lead one to follow a trail of learning from the historical aspects of netting, from the Egyptians to a modern pathway of design. Thank you Diane for giving us another book with outstanding projects, great historical background, and a excellent knowledge of Netting."
4,Very Interesting,"The author writes this book w/a lot of facts based on verifiable data. It really gives you an in depth look at the history of life on this planet. A history you won't find in any public schools! I am not sure how much is really true, but it sure makes you think about how everything has evolved. . . I am really disappointed that the map links don't work on the Kindle. They are referred to a lot in the book and I could not see them."
4,historical data from a lost era?,"I'm not sure if this book is fiction or non-fiction, but it reads as if the author knew what he was talking about. I find the book very interesting and found myself reading most of it in one sitting. I give the book 4 stars because the MAP links on the Kindle edition don't work. They speak a lot about maps and have links in the book but I can't see them when clicked on! Hope this is fixed soon."
4,great solid info,"I found this book helpful as I had never explored the story of Lemuia. The writer was consistant in making sure that all that was written was well documented with footnotes and credits. It read like a science book, so it was hard to pay attention at times. All in all, well done.thank you to the writer."
3,yawn,"If you're interested in this subject you can get more info from the Web than this book. Google Edgar Cayce, oror near death experiences or Akasha records. I made it half way through before getting too bored to continue."
4,Gorgeous but...,"This is an absolutely beautiful cd, wonderful for background music or to just sit and meditate to. The only drawback I found was that there are a couple of tracks on which there is a person speaking as if they are reading out of the Bible! I bought this cd for music, not Christian sermons. I would highly recommend it, but just be aware of those disconcerting tracks."
4,Feeding Systems,"I bought two of these, one to keep water and the other for dogfood for my small dog. I like them very much. They are tightly in place and secureso there is no problem with the container coming lose from the reservoir. I would have liked a different color (there are no other color choices)."
5,Simple & Effective Feeder and Waterer,"We wanted a reliable feeder/waterer for our cat when we are out of town for a few days. This set is perfect for the job. With the feeder completely full, it easily lasts up to 2 weeks or more for our cat. Also the water container will last well over a week. The water appears to stay fresh in between refills and cleaning. Once you are use to the way they are put together, I have had no trouble with spillage of either food and water. It just takes a little practice lining up the notches on the waterer. We purchased the medium, 5 lb/1 gallon combo and it fits the needs of our petite cat perfectly. She is not bothered by the water 'bubbling' down. The dry food container has a wide mouth so it is easy to fill, but sometimes it needs help with the food 'downloading'. Overall, this has served its purpose well and saves us from needing a pet sitter for few day periods. I would definitely recommend this product."
2,not for humid environments,"The hole that the food comes out of is huge, so the food just pours out automatically. But it's way too much food :( We've had to fashion a smaller hole with cardboard and are in the process of teaching our cat to dig for the food. The ""head bump"" method that other reviewers mention does not really work/isn't needed b/c food just gushes out b/c of gravity. I'd recommend a different product, especially if you live in a humid environment where the food cannot be left out for hours. Also, it's definitely not cat friendly."
4,Peace of mind,"I fill these with food and water, and I can leave the cat alone at home for days. Not that I do, but I could if I had to. It is also good if an accident should happen and leave her alone for some time.I am less impressed with the watering system. The water will start smelling after a couple of days, and that makes it a bit useless for a cat that doesn't drink so much. I have stopped using this as her regular water bottle as a result of this, and give her fresh water every day instead.One thing was that Princess had to get used to the water-""bowl"". When water is replaced with air, bubbles will float to the surface, and she wasn't too sure about that for a long time. She wouldn't drink out of it for a few days. She is now fascinated about the bubbles, and it doesn't scare her as much any more."
5,Great product.,"This is the second time I am buying. I bought the same set about 2 years ago at Petco for my boston terrier puppy. After graduating from school and moving back home for a year, my parents and their dogs are using them, too. They're still intact and I can't bear to take them away now. So here I am buying number 2. They look identical and I can only hope that they will last as long as the old ones have.I love them.My parents love them.The dogs love them.What more can you ask for?"
2,Overpriced junk,"Very clever idea, but in reality not worth the price.I do cat rescue and thought this would make life easier; I was wrong.The cats have knocked the water unit over and it came apart.The dry food unit might be fine with round kibble, but with Iams it gets blocked and the food doesn't come down easily. You have to shake the unit.Save your money and buy large bowls instead."
4,Should be reissued,"I know what you may be thinking. Is this writer okay in the head. We already have plenty of Beethoven concerto sets.But this set, though not the very best, should certainly be made available. I bought it many years ago for 10 dollars. At that price, you cannot beat the quality. First of all the sound is very smooth and rich. Secondly, the performances are live. The Berlin Symphony plays extremely well. The piano playing is crisp; Mr. Han's fingerwork is exceptional. These are very lyrical performances and always satisfying. Beethoven can always be played in different ways and sometimes you want to hear a gentler, kinder Beethoven. This set is for those times."
3,Worthwhile for its Conductor,"When this set next becomes available I assume it will be inexpensive; still, there are plenty of other bargain-priced Beethoven concertos (Kempff, Fleisher, et al.), so the competition is stiff.Derek Han plays well, but his somewhat neutral approach is better suited to Mozart, which he also recorded complete with Maestro Paul Freeman. Once again Freeman is the star. How is this conductor not better known? His approach is anything but idiosynchratic or even flamboyant, yet you never doubt that a major personality is leading these performances. The freshness comes as no surprise, since Freeman has recorded so much new music. The set is worth buying for his contribution alone."
4,great song,"Great song ""Dans la brume de Matin"" and Joe Dassin sings it better than anybody - except Nana Mouskouri, but I can't find her version."
3,Low Quality But Servicable,The director's chair frames are low quality but they do their job and provide seating. THe packing on is horrible causing one order to arrive broken and need replacement. Nicks and gouges also evident from poor packaging. For the price these frames should be better packaged.
1,Poor Quality Control,"We ordered this product (four counter height director chairs and canvas backs/seats) twice. The first shipment arrived with two dented boxes; there was a gouge in one chair leg, and each of the canvas backs were exactly one inch too short. The second shipment arrived with one damaged box; we attempted to fit the canvas back onto one chair, and again...one inch too short! Although the product is not the highest quality material, the chairs would have probably been sturdy enough to actually use, and would have been perfect as extra kitchen island seating for guests at holiday time. Apparently, there is no process by which to measure a piece of cloth to specs! This company's return policy is quite challenging as well, as return shipping labels are mailed via USPS, as opposed to internet, taking approximately seven business days! Customer service was also very adamant that they had never experienced any similar issues with other customers. Hmmm...maybe we just got unlucky twice."
3,Chair,"I am very happy with the director chair BUT I was very disappointed that it was delivered without the seat or the back to it. If you look at the ad, it is NOT obvious that the chair is sold without the seat and back. It became a real chore to find a real store that sold a seat. I could have saved time simply by buying it all here in my city. When I complained, I had no response."
3,A little cheaper looking thatn expected,"Nice , light weight , reasonably sturdy. Hardware cheaper looking thatn expected as well as wood itself. Selection of colors somehat limited."
5,new paper crafting concept,"I recently purchased this book and haven't been able to put it down. Sandra Evertson has taken paper crafting to a new higher level. I've just completed my second project from this book and am really impressed with the outcome. The pieces are high quality designs and design elements, along with easy to follow directions which made pieces that look impossible very easy and fun! A great book!"
2,"Nice ephemera, but the artist has a big ego","The ephemera are nice, but you need to break the spine of the book to copy them, so I just cut up the book and used the prints directly on my decoupage projects. The book was not edited for style - it is presented in two scrambled-together voices, as sometimes the artist and sometimes a fan of the artist/author. Come on, this is the author referring to herself in the third person, and she doesn't spare the self-admiration. The tone is very off-putting, and sometimes hard to believe. Example: In the introduction, the author notes that her customers ""snap up [the projects] faster than she can cut, decoupage and glue"". Pipe cleaner arms with paper faces. Indeed. I would pay for that. Right.Other than her self-admiration, not a bad book at all. As I said, the simplest thing was to cut up the book itself and use the photos as decoupage prints."
1,Not what I expected,The projects in this book were not what I expected at all. Some people might really enjoy them but I found them all kind of creepy.
2,Paper Projects,"I was disappointed in this book. Although, it is a good book for paper crafting. I was more interested in making paper mache projects. I was imagining projects that were like vintage Halloween paper mache projects."
3,vintage,"The projects in this book are definitely vintage and while that may appeal to some, it many not appeal to others. You can cut the book up and use the bits and pieces in your own work or you can just make things from scratch. There are one or two nice things in the book but that's about it. Not one of my favorites, that's for sure."
2,Yawn!....,"I can't believe that I had spent one Saturday evening watching this boring British comedy! I was expecting a Boudica-type rebel movie about how one woman stood against the invading Romans. Alas, all I got was to sit through an what seems like an awfully boring and crude comedy with thick accents about 3 village sisters who were united after the more humbler one was sent by her village to go rescue the red-dead warrior sis was captured by the Romans during a raid. The captured red-head sister was found and rescued through odd chances of luck. All ends well with the lucky young heroine drove the invading Romans out from a second invasion with her bee-power.You can probably get the full synopsis at Bucketmovies dot com.I'm giving the show 2 stars for the 2 scenes of the unnamed sexy brunette Goddess of Victory whom I don't recall even being mentioned in the credits.Recommended viewing:The History Channel: Warrior Queen Boudica"
2,Please enter a title for your review,"Being a minor fan of the tv series Smack The Pony I thought this movie might be worth watching, but the comedy here is sparser and less offbeat, mostly just in service of a conceptual plot which turns out to be remarkably dull. I guess the subject matter is intended to capitalize on the success of the Lord Of The Rings trilogy, which would be fine if they had any jokes or ideas to back it up, but this movie seems to be lacking both."
1,terrible movie,"I just want to say gladiatress is the only movie I went to see at the cinema that I have ever walked out of before the end, it was just that bad. I knew I was in for a bad movie when I was the only person in the cinema.I normally enjoy british comdey but the jokes were just aweful and embarassingly bad, woeful acting, inane script. Don't even get the DVD.I had to give this at least 1 star to post but it deserves 0"
3,Python In Tights,"The other bloke summed up the plot well enough. So no point in me writing another one.This movie might appeal to the fans of Mel Brooks or Monty Python. Tho, not quite as good as one of there films, still good for a zaney laugh or two."
2,Staged takes should get run,"I am a huge Jim Rome fan and I looked forward to the cd. I was dissappointed because all of the smack that was run was ""old smack"" The only way to run old smack and make it work is to play the original takes when they were first run, possibly in a ""best of"" format. There is way too much Don King and his mindless dribble. I'll give the takes 2 stars and the music 2 1/2 stars. If you are a jungle clone, this is still worth the 5 hours of work you'll have to do to earn enough money to buy it. OUT"
4,good solid smack from the pimp in the box,great cd from the king of sports radio. good mix of takes from jim rome's years on the air. must buy for sports fans!!
1,I want my money back!!,"This has got to be the worst CD I have bought in years!! I've got a take for you Jim, ""Don't waste the money of your fans putting out this crap!"" Not even the few musical gems by Guns N Roses and the Romones could save this. Have a point and don't suck Jim Rome!"
1,Bummer of a CD,"This CD was not at all cool. What was it? A few funny parts (sports, cops) the rest was just noise! I've spent better money."
4,Some classic takes!,Some very funny takes from the Jungle (espeically Neck-car and spelling bee). I liked having the full versions of songs you hear on the Jungle. But they went overboard with the digital mixing on too many of the tracks. Maybe next time we'll just get a CD of Jim's takes.
1,CLONES--BACK AWAY FROM THIS CD!!!!!!,"This could be the worst of Romey! Very few takes with a lot of scripted Rome. I love Van Smak and this CD almost made me stop listening to the Jungle. I would think Jim would know better than to release a big, greasy GROWLER like this. I AM OUT!!"
2,Not that great,"Only got a couple good cards even though I ordered like 5 booster packs. Also, please be wary of the shipping! I ordered like 13 booster packs and they charge 2$ per booster pack which is ridiculous! (They all came in one shipment.) Get a collector's box, the packs are much better and in return the pulls from it alone are worth it."
4,I like the historical references,"I like this series for bringing this time period to life. It's a good story but the interplay between the hero and heroine is somewhat predictable. Also for a strong-minded, independent woman I find that Molly spends too much time second-guessing her decisions. Overall, I enjoyed the quick read."
4,fiction,"A picture of New York for an Irish girl and the constraints on her behavior. She is learning to think bigger, but her boyfriend, who is a policeman isn't learning anything it seems."
5,A Woman Ahead of Her Time,"I loved DEATH OF RILEY and FOR THE LOVE OF MIKE firmly establishes Molly Murphy as a woman to be reckoned with! Dauntless in her pursuit of criminals, Molly never loses her warmth or compassion. She is a character of many dimensions and a woman who will not turn away from the inequities of her times. This is a wonderful series filled with exhaustive research that portrays a window of New York in the early years of the 20th century so vivid, you can hear the rustle of long skirts and the snap of a parasol."
5,"Short, Concise & Inspirational","Sufism and Good Character is a short work that leaves one wanting to read it over and over again.The basis of the book are sayings of the Blessed Prophet (Allah bless him and give him peace) with insightful, wise commentary by Imam Zafar Uthmani. These carefully selected sayings leave one blessing the Prophet (Allah bless him and give him peace) because of both the text of the hadith, but also many times over because of the beauty of his sweet words.Beautifully translated and bound, Sufism and Good Character makes for an excellent gift!"
1,Don't buy based on commercials,"I bought this after hearing it on a commercial. Well, it wasn't! Very ""interesting"" CD, though. Since I bought it, I'll have to live with it!"
1,Marketing rubbish,"XBOX 360 controllers are USB. This is just a standard Xbox 360 controller. Don't pay extra money for a ""PC compatable"" controller, as they are all just USB.I use my standard 360 USB controller on my PC with windows no problems, works fine for me with the default plug and play driver on windows. Also I hear microsoft has a free controller driver download if you do a search for it.Bottom line is, they are trying to charge you extra for ""PC compatability"", when they are already PC compatable."
5,Perfect for newer PC games,"Had an old reliable Logitech controller for years but was finding it was not compatable with newer PC games. This controller solved all my problems. Works perfect with newer games like Need For Speed 2010, and MLB2K Baseball. Even works with some older games, just look on the internet and you'll probably find a solution to your problem. Liked this controller so much, I just ordered a wireless black one. Also kind of gives your computer a cool updated look using an XBOX controller. It says to install the software first, but I just plugged it in and it works (Windows 7)."
2,Xbox 360 Controller for Windows,Good product just haven't taken time to work with it. I'm still more of a mouse/keyboard gamer.
1,2-second delay,"This controller is the biggest letdown I've ever experienced with a gaming console. Since it was standard with the system I bought, I had no choice. There is at least a 2-3 second delay with each action I take with it. I press 'A' to accept the letter 'a' for my profile name, and three seconds later it appears. Try selecting plays in Madden with that kind of delay. This is a completely worthless piece of garbage. BTW, I'm working within 4 feet of the console, with nothing in between the controller and the console. Perhaps I got a lemon. Garbage."
1,"Great, just don't buy from amazon","Great controller, works wonders on those PC games (I'm looking at YOU Assassins Creed) that have poor KB/M controls... just don't buy from Amazon. It didn't even ship till a week after I purchased them, then took over a week from then to arrive... odd."
1,MICROSOFT XBOX CONTROLLER FOR WINDOWS,"I AM NOT REAL HAPPY WITH THIS PRODUCT AND I AM DISGUSTED WITH THE SUPPORT FROM MICRO SOFT.WHEN I DOWNLOADED THE CD MY COMPUTER AND PLUGGED IN THE USB CABLE I LOST ALL MY SOUNDIN MY COMPUTER, I WENT TO THE TROUBLE SHOOTING PROGRAM WINDOWS XP HAS AND IT INDICATED THERE IS NOTHING WRONG WITH INSTALLATION, I STILL HAVE NO SOUND WHEN IT IS HOOKED UP. I CAN'T GET ANY HELP FROM ANYBODY TO ADDRESS THIS PROBLEM,SO I DON'T USE IT. I THREW IT IN THE CORNER WITH ALL THE OTHER JUNK I GOT THAT DON'T WORK BECAUSE I CAN'T RETURN IT."
5,Wonderful!,"For me, I hate using the mouse and keyboard to play games like Black-Ops and BFBC2. When I heard you could buy an Xbox 360 controller for the PC version of Black Ops,I was all over that. This controller works great, just like the ones that come with the xbox. It was super easy to install, and now I'm loving playin even more! I would highly recommend it for someone who is looking for PC gamer controller."
4,"The best gamepad for pc, plus 360...","Perhaps quite good in special for those games that are sport or simulator, the control plug-in the computer and one that another game brings it preformed, the disadvantage are in the games of first person, is lack customary, but in this case I believe that serious better combibacion ""keyboard - mouse"", in the x box 360, is no difference... the control contains vibrator and an entrance for headphones of the 360, works in the PC and in the 360, also it brings a long cable that allows to maintain something of distance..."
4,"Really nice, when it worked...","My dad ordered this XBOX 360 Controller from Office Depot. It workd flawlessly in many games like Halo and Flight Simulator X. However, the rumble feature is not supported in many games. For example, there is no rumble in Halo, but it rumbles when you crash or land in FSX. One more concern. When I cleaned my controller with a damp cloth, following the instructions,it malfunctioned. If any of you know why, please email at [...] Thanks."
4,"Works with most games, issue with sound which was fixed","Seems to work with games that will support other gamepads. I have Vista 64 and Microsoft has drivers for it on their website.THERE WAS AN ISSUE WITH SOUND - PLUG IT IN AND I LOST SOUND IN MY SPEAKERS (my mobo is a Gigabyte DS3)No support anywhere on the microsoft website or internet on this, and I saw a frazzled previous reviewer... so here's the fix:The controller has an integrated headset feature (you can buy seperately), but your pc may (like mine did) see the controller as a Controller AND a ""headset."" It automatically enabled the ""headset"" (thus disabling my speakers).Go to Control Panel > SoundYou'll see it as a microsoft headset device enabled -- disable this ""headset"". Then your speakers should come back on. This does not interfere with the joystick at all.Enjoy!"
5,Fantastic Controller,"This is the best possible controller for the PC that I have found thus far. I have tried many controllers that are similar to the PS2 design, but they all lacked decent button recoiling, easy to push buttons, and slimness. All other controllers I have tried are too bulky and after ~30 mins. my hand begins to get tired. I have played one game with it so far (Winning Eleven 9) and it works perfectly. No lag, comfortable feel, and the buttons are easy to use especially for a fast sports game like soccer. Obviously, if you've used the wired regular XBOX 360 controller you know this is the same thing with different packaging (and an install CD). I highly recommend it!"
4,Does not work with Final Fantasy XI,"I bought this controller for the primary purpose of using it to play Final Fantasy XI on the PC. I play the Xbox 360 version and it once I started using the PC version, I decided I'd like to have standardized controllers. Makes perfect sense to me that it would just, I dunno, work. But it does not. First, the controller is not supported directly, so you have to reconfigure the game to use it. Fine, but even then it's just...not...right. It's sluggish and slow, you can't use the trigger buttons to access the macro menus, and essentially does not work. At least it's not worth my trouble. So if you're buying this controller for that game, skip it--until Square gets their act together or Microsoft does (frankly, I'm not sure who to blame here). Note: the controller itself is flawless; it works just fine on my Xbox."
4,Works with Windows Vista for Legos Indiana Jones,Our other controller didn't have enough buttons for the Legos Indiana Jones for PC so I bought this one and it works flawlessly with the game.
4,Works well!,"I already had one of these controllers and I've played through PC games with pleasure. Some of the games that I found this controller useful are: NFS Most Wanted (I spent the most time on this game), NFS Carbon, Test Drive Unlimited, Lost Planet - Extreme Condition, and Madden '08. I bought a second one so I could play Madden '08 with friends.It works pretty well with driving games (unless you have enough $ to buy a G25, then that's probably the best option) and 3rd person shooters. I prefer mouse & keyboard for 1st person shooters. It's a little sensitive with Emulators, but it's still playable.I highly recommend this. I've tried different controllers, but nothing is built as well as this piece."
4,Xbox 360 controller for PC,"This is a very nice tool to have for the new releases on PC; the games come Xbox-controllers-ready with rumble features. I recommend getting the wireless controller though, MAKE SURE YOU KNOW WHICH YOU ARE BUYING. Both, Wireless and hardwired controllers, are easy to install and are compatible with most games. Also, they may be connected to an Xbox 360."
4,great control but doesn't work with most games,This control works great but it doesn't work with most games. It only works with games that say made for windows. That totally sucks! That's why I gave it four stars.
3,Warm but not burning,"I love disaster books, but this one was merely good, not great.Hoffer details seven fires and their effects on the United States afterwards. It was interesting to read about three I had never heard of, Boston, Pittsburgh and Baltimore, and Hoffer succeeds very well when describing the fires and the chaos that ensues. His attempts to try to tie the infernos in with other sweeeping social changes, however, are not as successful. I was not convinced that the fire of Boston 1760 had all that much effect on the revolution 16 years later, for example. Hoffer concludes that rich people benefit from fires but poor people suffer--hardly a shocking conclusion. Also, the writing is a little overblown at times. Did the Detroit police really see the people in the slums as ""less than human?"" Still, despite the book's flaws, it is still overall a good read for people who enjoy disaster books."
4,Quite well written.,"There are two parallel storylines going here; one involving the Defiant and its crew as they explore the Gamma Quadrant, the other involving events back at the station. The first storyline was much more interesting and compelling than the second; I frequently found myself annoyed when we switched from plot A to plot B, and always was delighted when we switched back. In addtition, we got a nice conclusion to the first plot at the end of the book, while the second plot was left hanging on a cliff in a typical old movie serial style: ""Tune in next week, to find out what happened."" Still, even the second plot was good, just not as good as the first. Characterization was very strong in both of them, there was both enough action and enough food for thought to balance the story nicely. Definitely worth the read."
4,Enjoyed!!,"This was a great book. I enjoyed the seeing the Dr, Dax and Nog change. It was great to see what the Dr would be without his ""gifts"". Ezri Dax becaming just Ezri, and Nog regrowing this leg back. I hope I didn't ruin the book for you. Enjoy!"
1,Terrible service,"The company has cancelled the order on me with NO EXPLANATION! Just sorry for the inconvinience, but your order has been cancelled!What a poor customer service!!!"
3,FUN-ENOUGH EUROTRASH,"CONFESSIONS OF A POLICE CAPTAIN is the best of this lot, as much fun as any political european art movie from any respectable director...Z or THE CONFORMIST without the slickness.all of the movies have faded visuals, which is typical of such collections, at a cheap price."
1,AWFUL!!!!!!! ALL FOREIGN FILMS -AT LEAST IN ENGLISH AND NOT SUBTITLED.,DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY UNLESS YOU LIKE FOREIGN(ITALIAN) FILMS. HORRIBLE-INCLUDING ALOT OF GRIZZLEY VIOLENCE.
1,"Wild Supposition, Little Fact","For any serious student of history, this book is a poorly constructed, little cited foray into the author's fantasy about who his ancestress was. The only chapter I've discovered that seemed to have a basis in concrete contemporary sources was a chapter about Nell Gwyn's household accounts.Large segments of the book are devoted to 'what Nell must have thought/must have felt/must have done.' No proof is cited...It's a frustrating read because it is impossible to tell if there really is any truth to what the author supposes. As a descendant of Nell Gwyn and Charles II, it's clear the author chooses to paint both parties and their relationship in the warmest light. He also denegrates Charles' relationships with other mistresses. All of these occur (again) without any proof.The author hardly has any endnotes and his bibliography comes primarily from books far after the actual time.Overall, it reads as historical fiction with an accurate timeline of events."
3,Good look but definately biased,"I lived for a while by Nell Gwyn's house in Newmarket, Suffolk, England and so was interested in her greatly. I've read biographies of Charles II and had a perspective of his mistresses. The details of Nell's life are great; however, as a descendent of Charles II and Nell Gwyn, Mr Beauclerk's bias is obvious. His descriptions of the other mistresses are vicious at times. A great perspective of Restoration England."
4,Very good biography,"I really enjoyed this book. I'd been looking aroung for a biography on Nell Gwynn and it helps that it was written by a descendent who had a lil bit more insight than some other writers might have. This book really gives that feeling of what life was like for Nell, her trials and pitfalls. Very enjoyable."
4,Gst,"Muy bueno, el libro es sencillo y muy interesante!!!! Lo unico malo k no tiene el significado de Los numeros."
3,The pace is too slow and lingering too much,"The writing is very smooth but the writer spent too much time to paint the veiled several key characters with very very long paragraphs, sometimes a whole page only got about 1-1/10 long paragraphs which were usually very tiresome to focus and read. The prose style writing may be very good but also kills the pace to an almost dragging, snailingly crawled monologue styled narration, just like the late man who rode a bus and look outside the window, the smoky glass made everything distant and vague and made the scenary going back and disappeared. A mystery should not be written like a some kind memorial stuff lingering in yesterday. Like a chess game, both players got to meet the time limits, reading a novel or mystery is the same thing, you just can't have too much time wasted in blabbing and making the reader waiting too long and too much"
4,Gives Energy and Combats the Cold,"I like taking a lot of vitamin c, especially when i feel like I'm starting to get sick a little. As soon as I start to feel a scratch in my throat I like to load my system up with vitamin C as soon as possible. Emergen-C makes it very convenient to do this with the packets and that's what I've been using for longer than I can remember. My husband started taking pure vitamin c powder for energy,Vitamin C (Ascorbic Acid) Bulk Powder 250 Grams (8.83 Oz), so I began using that instead by just mixing it in with my morning orange juice. I guess I created my own recipe of emergen-c! If you don't mind weighing it out, it's so much cheaper to get it in pure powder form and literally lasts forever whether you use it for energy or as an anti-oxidant which is what I use it for personally."
4,Enjoyable,"The interaction between the family Rodney, his wife, and kids, is fun to watch. The exercises are basic and adaptable to little ones - but my two children under age 4 were not really interested. My 4-year-old loved it, though. We enjoy doing it together. It is a pretty decent work-out for a family video. The setting is very pretty and the music is relaxing."
2,Not what I expected,"I'm a beginner, and I bought this DVD to work out with my 4-yr-old daughter.I was expecting a slower pace, simpler poses (hand stands are NOT simple to a beginner!), and very detailed verbal positioning and breathing instructions (presented by an adult, not a child). It was very distracting to have to look up at the screen while I was doing the poses.My daughter enjoys other exercise DVDs and (unlike me) has joints like rubber bands, but she didn't like this DVD, either.If you and your child are already experienced yoga practitioners, this DVD might work for you, but if you're new, give it a miss.I hope Rodney Yee remakes Family Yoga DVD one of these days, because the concept has a lot of potential, and he has a demonstrated talent for making beautiful, soothing yoga DVDs. I wish this DVD had been presented in the style of, say, AM Yoga (which I received free with my yoga kit)."
3,Rodney Yee: Yoga Journal's Family Yoga,"Although this video offers more fundamental Yoga instruction with respect to the Yoga Kids, Vol. 1-3 series, it lacks teaching many important basics to the adult beginner and has an odd selection of poses for the novice Yogi"
2,A Little Uninspiring,"I was hoping for something a little more creative, maybe playful, more FUN, more partner postures for more connection??? It was interesting to observe the family dynamics. Beautiful backround but,overall, a little uninspiring."
1,This could have been a good book - but it isn't.,"Great photos - nice quilts. That is, unfortunately all I can say good about the book, and there are a lot of better buys out there with nice quilt photos. These self-appointed ""experts"" have added little to the body of available information on vintage quilts. If these three are appraising quilts then I wonder about the program that sponsors them due to the fact that book is full of inaccuracies. Discussion on how they arrived at the values (and many are questionable) is lacking which would be nice seeing that is their area of ""expertise"". It is almost like they pulled the numbers from a hat. The book does little to promote the credibility of the author's and certainly isn't the publisher's best effort, it's just a pretty price guide that unfortunately like all price guides was out of date the day it was released."
1,Nothing Like the Title Suggests,"I purchased this book because I own several quilts that I have picked up over the years and wanted to figure out dates and get an idea of how to go about valuing them. While the title of this book suggests this is a possibility a mere page and a half are devoted to identification, dating, pricing, care and storage. The remainder of the book is a catalogue of their collection and while they own some lovely quilts I was not interested in a coffee table book but rather one that provided some real data.There are lovely photographs of more than 100 quilts and if you want to browse through a lovely collection, this is a nice book, though there are better for this as well. If you are looking for information on valuing your own quilts, this book will get you no closer."
3,Quilt Reference,"This is a quality reference for quilts from the period. But, it only provides a brief description and photo of each quilt. It will not tell you how determine the value of a quilt."
3,MACK 10 still bring game,"This album is a must for mack 10 fans and westside connection fans, Though if you are first time buyer to mack 10 i would suggest The recipe or Based on a true story, because those are his best albums, this album is nice though. not classic but a solid album for any westcoast fan"
5,A great West Coast album,"This is an exelent release from Mack 10 who's known as one third of the group West Side Connection. This is a great album from beginning to end. Great writing, great beats, and great rapping. This may be a come back for the west but sadly this won't sell well because of poor marketing and promotion. Despite the lack luster sales this is still one of the year's best albums."
4,disconnect,"The cordless mouse has come a long way. This one I have found to be among the top ones. I am left handed and the rest of my family is right handed,therefore the cord becomes an issue. quick easy plug and play with quick recharges on its own dock. no batteries or usb plugs needed. simple, and effective. have had it for 4 months, so far no complaints."
1,Returns are a nightmare,"This product arrived in a timely fashion. It was never opened because it was purchased as a gift which turned out to be a duplicate. The return process is a NIGHTMARE. The directions are unclear and my first three emails were returned to me unanswered. Finally I got the authorization code to return the merchandise, but I am very unhappy with the restocking fee. I do a tremendous amount of online shopping and I will never order from Amazon again."
1,This product deserves less than one star,"Only because their customer service (Thomson/RCA) should be completely obliterated. I have spent 7 months trying to obtain a replacement for a mouse that only worked for two months, despite paying well over $100. The company has many things they need to fix, but the first should be their customer-facing reps who, I can only presume, are hired for their non-intuitive or unaccomodating demeanor. A real pleasure!"
1,Terrible Customer Service,"I had a small problem with the device, and needed a replacement part. When I called I was told to go to the website. When I couldn't find what I wanted they simply told me that the part was not available, and I should just go buy a whole new unit.As if the content wasn't bad enough, the representative was shockingly rude. the device is neat, but I would not support the company."
3,"Interesting, but..........","I purchased this book because I have an interest in Nuclear Weapons Systems. This book, however, kind of misses the mark.On the plus side. the book is actually a work of several authors; each treating a seperate (and diverse) topic. The culminated work, in very small type face, is a few pounds heavy.On the minus side, very little actually touches on specific weapons systems. Albeit,there is a great section on arming, fuzing, and firing systems, worth the price of the whole book, the majority of the book touches on policy, communications, and command/control issues, most of which was rendered moot by Ronald Regan and the end of the cold war.If you are interested in Policy Issues of the 80's, you will LOVE this book. If you wanna see the guts of a W-80, I heartily recommend anything by Chuck Hansen or Richard Rhodes. Money better spent......."
4,My wife bought them - she loves them,"I'm doing this b/c I think it is helpful to fill out these customer reviews. I personally haven't used these products, but my wife is very particular about what goes on her skin and she absolutely loves these products. I would have to say that I like the products b/c I see and feel the effects of the product on her face and I am quite pleased."
5,Picture Perfect,"I am another former student who has learned an enormous amount from Charles Deemer's classroom instruction and his invaluable corresponding book. I have studied with other screenwriting teachers and found Charles to be the most grounded, knowledgeable, generous, and gifted among them. Using what he has taught me, I have had my work read and optioned. His book sits next to my computer, so that I may turn to again and again."
2,Poor Design,"First off they are pretty good looking shorts, but at $33.95 we want more. The problem is one of my pet peeves typically found in cheap shorts, the pockets are extremely shallow. When sitting stuff falls out. You may lose your pocket knife and keys and phone and other valuable stuff ..every time you get comfy. Secondly, the cinch rope at the waist is short! I guess it would be a perfect length on shorts with a 32 inch waist, but on my 42"" it's a joke. Rope is cheap adding several inches to the shorts so the thing can function would cost almost nothing. Also the overall length of the shorts is very long. On my 6'1"" frame they hang to several inches below my knee. Almost capri length. So..in my opinion keep shopping."
3,"Wayyy too long a crotch, otherwise would be nice.","Nice looking shorts... but the crotch is very unlike long military pants, like the 2586 Vintage Paratrooper Fatigues. These shorts' crotch aren't just long, it's SUPER long as in most of the pants/legs! Not cool or easily adjusted up. Otherwise the style and drawstring are nice with lots of pockets, although perhaps not as deep as should be, but the super long crotch keeps ruining this pants and its style for me. Also note that Vintage military attire seems to be generally roomy at the waist, which if you don't plan on wearing a belt might be an issue for you, however with a belt they actually create a nice profile."
5,Exhaustivly thorough,"This book is similar to ""Play Your Best Pool"" and has some overlapping content, but focuses on 9-ball. Exhaustively thorough for the true enthusiast of the game."
3,....,"The diagrams used in this book are clear and concise. However, the explanations of the shots depicted on the diagrams are very cumbersome, with references to degrees of angles, shot ratings, and player ratings. Half of the book contains diagrams with shot routes, but no explanation as to where to apply English on the cueball. The best section of the book is the chapter on position routes The book is very comprehensive and would help pool players who are at least a B or A rating."
2,It is okay.,"This video is about the Irish pop band made up of 4 girls. They are all friends and they are not an organized group like O-Town, Eden's Crush, or Hear'Say. It's just like the offical video but not with the videos and exta footage. Just go buy the offical one they have released."
2,some kitch appeal though doesn't hold up,This is a fun cultural artifact though listening through the full CD gets a bit monotonous and kills its initial charm. You'd be better off purchasing a few songs off iTunes to let pop up in your shuffle and give you a giggle every now and then.
2,mislead,I was mislead by this posting. I was under the impression this was a 4 cd set. I had a copy of this set years ago before my ex-wife stole it. I thought I was buying the 4 cd set again but I only recieved ONE disc. I am NOT happy. I will be looking for the complete set.
1,Very unhappy,Have ordered this item 3x previously for grandsons graduating from high school and it has always been 4 CD's. This time it was one CD! I have returned it. Maybe Amazon can tell me how I can get the 4-CD set?I am happy with the other two items ordered for this high school graduating grandson.Classical Music for People Who Hate Classical Music
1,The worst approach for beginners,"This is a overly bad commercial operation, a really wrong way to make beginners close to classical music. This is a perfect example about how bad marketing is presenting sublime human creations trying to turn it in a mass-market product for the average Joe. I was exposed to classical music at the age of 14 listening Bach's Branderbourgh concerts, then softly moving to Operas starting with Rossini 'Il Barbiere di Siviglia'. then the passion started growing more and more, aided by further readings around. On the top of all, I received a good background education at school aiding me to go better in depth to this to this. The knowledge process is harder that this kind of compilation make people suppose to be ...Sadly, the fact that classical music (and jazz) market share is below 4% is a further indication of the degradation of world wide listeners' audience ... maybe spent on school education some of the military budget could help"
1,Poor sound quality,"I was very disappointed in the sound quality of this CD. It would be different if I had paid only a few dollars, but to pay [this much] for a CD and to have to turn the volume all the way up to hear is ridiculous."
1,I Hate 'Classical Music for People Who Hate Classical Music',"Thirty-second snippets of horribly cliched classical music? Check.Grainy recordings by obscure conductors? Check.Marketed towards ignorant soccer moms and yuppies? Check.WHAT A DEAL!Looking for a high-brow introduction into the massive juggernaut that is Western classical music? Well, go away. This CD is strictly for the diluded and lazy. However, if you're looking for something to play in the background over a candlelit dinner of Hamburger Helper with you significant other, then by all means purchase this failure."
5,It's got all the best!,"These CD's have all the best! I am not a tried and true classical music fanatic, but there are many songs on here that are ""must haves"". Four CD's is alot of music and they encompass a great variety. This purchase was WELL worth it. You'll love it!"
1,Do not Buy,"I do know it says classical music for people who hate it, but serioulsly you would have better luck never listening to classical music again. The recordings are awfull and do not do justice to any of the composers. Buy something else."
2,CD set is misnamed,"They should have titled this ""classical music for people who love classical music"" because most of the selections are typical classical music. The title suggests it would be lively selections of ""light classical"" music that is more upbeat, i.e. Sabre Dance, etc. I really don't hate classical music at all and have many classical CDs in my collection but I really wanted to hear more exciting selections. I won't be purchasing any more of this set but if you like traditional classical music these are good one."
1,When we can listen to a CD for people who hate rock/pop etc. music?,"Please change this very IDIOT title, someone must tell this to the producer. I don't think there are people who hate classical music, and if there are I do not want to express a thought about them....."
3,Ear-Candy and good introduction to Classical Music,"This compilation offers the most popular themes and familiar tunes in small doses, in a sampler. Unless you've lived under a rock, you can't have helped but have heard of some of these tunes, whether at a wedding, or as background music to some action scene in a movie. You get 4 CDs for the price of 1, so it's a great value, and who cares if they are not the most famous orchestras or performers. The only thing is that the pieces are somewhat abridged, and are designed to please the uninitiated, hence ear-candy. Good enough to whet your appetite for something more substantial and a start a music appreciation."
3,My husband's first reaction when I handed him ...,"My husband's first reaction when I handed him this soap was, """"If you were to drop this in the shower, you'd break a toe!"""" At eight ounces, this bar is huge! The bar has a """"fatty"""" scent similar to homemade lye soap. Not exactly unpleasant, but definitely not a signature scent, either! However, the odor doesn't seem to linger after you use the product, so it isn't noticeable later. Damp soap develops an unappealing layer of slime. All in all, though, the soap seems to lather and clean well and moisturize adequately."
3,Some of the best party rock ever,"This is party rock at its wonderful best.Unfortunately, this album has one of the worst cover art of all times for a rock band. The single image of those two dudes (Zander and Nielsen) in the front must have put away a lot of potential customers away from the records...As for the songs, they are pop / rock, crystal clear sounding, overproduced, bombastic. It's a really enjoyable album."
5,LOVE THIS STORY...,"Mace Donovan is a supremely arrogant male who is patient (sometimes) with Kat, the stubborn one. I laughed and smiled throughout this book and often thought that Mace should stuff Kat's pride down her throat. Charming book that I have re-read for several years."
4,Rebel in his arms,"Great read with suspense and mystery. Although this is classified as a romance novel, the story is the main plot the romance is tasteful, not graphic and fits as part of the story not the main focus. The female character is strong and smart. I liked it."
1,Poor Quality,Nice size and design but very poor quality. I bought to put on the back of my Suzuki Sidekick to carry a deer on but there is no way it could handle a 200 lb deer without bending.
1,Garbage,"Another poppish album, containing lyrics and beats geared towards females and club going metrosexuals.Only a couple of good tracks, if you've heard their earlier material, then you know which songs I'm talking about.MTV queers will dig this, however fans of their earlier Horror-core style will only find themselves pressing the skip button often."
2,Supa BS,"Manne I've been listening since the Early 90's and This album right here sux. It's missing that ol' 3-6 sound...yea yea they are trying to move on and reinvent themselves, but it just doesn't work. Manne the posse junt on this album doesn't hold weight to earlier HCP posse junts. If you do plan on buying this album get the dual disc...da dvd is worth its weight a lil."
2,Three SIx Mafia Sucks,This group is all hype. I bought this album because of gotta stay fly but this rest of the tracks sucks. f@#k 3 6 mafia the best group in the south is boyz n da hood.
2,What happened to you guys?,"3 6 Mafia used to be so good. They were the best rap group from 1998-2000. Now they are commercialized. With songs like ""Stay Fly"". It is a nice club song but there are stupid lyrics like ""I gotta stay Fly-y-y-y-y-y-y-y until I die i-i-i-i-i-i. The whole album sounds like filler."
5,another three 6 mafia classic,they did it agin all the tracks are hot that whole album was hood and street thats real music right there and if your aint feelin this your a ho for sho .this is gangsta music hard music you gotta be hood and street 2 feel this.this worth coping
2,ha ha ha!!!!,"MANE these boyz had falled of foreal. dont get it wrong im a big fan..but DAMN this album might have about 2 or 3 alright song on it and most of the chous can go this aint fo the thug and banners, nall this is fo the super lame out there mane i give this joint a 2 because im from memphis so i was nice keep doing what u doin yo gotti goin to take ova"
1,Horrible CD,"I loved Three 6 Mafia, so I went ahead and bought this one. Well, it was horrible! Do not buy it."
2,2 1/2 Stars,I am a huge fan of old triple six mafia. This album wasn't that great. I'm not mad because this one got airplay or they got a grammy. I just don't really like it. It was missing some people such as Gangsta Boo & Lord Infamous. Standout Tracks: Stay HIGH & Half On A Sack
3,Not there best effort,"...This review is to just point out that 3-6 may not be as good as they were,especially because so much of the original Hypnotize Camp is gone...but it's still worth a few listens.In my opinion their best album was ""When the smoke clears"".But enough about Three 6,cause I think they are gonna be fire no matter what.I mostly wrote this review in hopes that the guy from North Memphis name dollar ""dollar"" would read it...he wrote a review on October 14th,2005.I wold just like to know,if he reads this..or can read this since it is written in pretty decent english,if he by any chance learned to write while living in the ""north,north"". Because judging by his review,it seems like a 3rd grader that wrote it.Hey kid,you have to be over 18 to by the Three 6 album."
3,Where is Lord Infamous?,"Ever since Gangsta Boo and Koopsta Knicca(most underated rapper today) left Three Six it hasn't been the same. But now Lord Infamous isn't on this one. This album does not stay true to the sound of Three Six and it just seems like they are trying to make music for the radio. If you want to hear some good Triple Six then get The End or Ch. 2. But this album is still better then most of the rap albums out today. This CD also has the worst posse song they have every made, I still don't know why they signed Chrome or Boogeymane cause they are both horrible. Only get this album if you are a hardcore Three Six fan."
3,"Good , but gone commercial","Mane , let me tell you, this album bump, but it aint the old ""snort coke, drink sizzurp, pimpin hoes"" three six i used to know. The beats are tight but they gon commercial, its no longer the raw three six as in da unbreakables, they even catering to the ladies now (soft). Overall good album, but hardcore three six fans as myself will know they went soft when they hear it. lets just hope project come back with something good."
4,INFAMOUS IS STILL DOWN WIT DA CLICK!!!!!!!!,"they surprised me with this cd...i didnt think they would come out with another three 6 cd after only a year from their last cd(choices 2)there are a few instant classics on this cd of course stay fly and yes they r saying gotta stay high on the hook they only say stay fly on the censored version..half on a sack(better than the original)and body parts 3, one of their best posse songs...and for all u people that think infamous has either been kicked out or left the click.....are wrong..he violated probation and now hes locked up i dont know how long but its in the xxl wit 3-6 on the covor....NAPTOWN BIATCH!!!"
5,the most unknown to be well known,There are no words to describe the down south finest from Memphis Ten. The album is ridiculously hot. These are the most talented rap group in the music industry and yet it them this long to get internationally recognized. That just goes to show that hard work definetly pays off if u never give up on your God given talent.
5,great cd,"this cd was the s***. even tho i like da unbrakeables better this cd is still real good. my favorite songs are poopin my collar,stay fly,roll wit it,and half on a sack. evrybody who reads this i think that ifyou aint got it then you should get this and other three six cds"
1,terrible quality dvd,The quality of this dvd is so poor it should not be for sale. I could only watch a small portion of it and sent it back for a refund.
2,wanna-be Preston Sturges,"The opening joke, immediately after the credits, is great! And the exposition anticipates Bogart's IN A LONELY PLACE by several years, except the wrong female gets murdered. Broderick Crawford provides an easy-going, endearing performance without a hint of his later lockjaw screen personality. And the supporting cast--especially the adult women--are fine.But this attempt to combine Sturges satire, screwball comedy, and ""My Friend Irma"" is done in by the irritating, obnoxious heroine of the piece who keeps popping up when one wishes she'd be shutting up. The Irma-esque caricature is utterly unfunny and, repeatedly identifying herself as nearly jail-bait age, her romance with the much older O'Brien is as irrational as it is disturbing. And what happens to Eve Arden is an unpleasant shock as well."
4,TERRIFIC TRUE FRENCH CRIME THRILLER -- SEXY AND VIOLENT,"The sensational true crime story that Bertrand Tavernier's FRESH BAIT (Koch Lorber) is based on shocked even the French.Young, sexy, entrepreneurs Nathalie, Eric and Bruno need big money and they need it fast. They want to open a retail clothing chain in America and they figure it'll cost about $10 million.What to do?How about using hot-looking Nathalie as sex bait to lure unsuspecting men into an apartment, torture, rob and murder them? Sounds like a plan.But when two men enter an apartment to never be seen alive again, their get rich quick plans suddenly go awfully awry.Winner of the Golden Bear at the Berlin International Film Festival, this masterfully directed, horrific true crime caper is what sex and violence in movies is all about. And I mean that as praise as it effectively reveals the pure evil that shimmers under the superficial illusions of innocence."
3,Not so good and not so bad,This is an interesting film. Mainly because of Marie Gillain. She is beautiful and topless in several scenes. Her acting is great too.
5,Excellent,"I like this book, mainly because I find I share similar tastes as as the authors. If they recommend a CD, I generally enjoy it. Their selection of the best recordings of people like Corea and Jarrett I also agree with. Whereas I have been disappointed with other publications such as the Penguin and AMG guides which have a different viewpoint.Not surprisingly, the book is very good on the British scene and what is happening on the Babel, Caber and Provocateur labels. The UK is very interesting at the moment, with lots of young exciting players and music."
4,tiny jewels,"Another great offering from Cold Blue Records. This collection of short pieces for clarinet and assorted instruments is the newest offering from Marty Walker, renowned champion of new music and collaborator on many of Cold Blue's recordings. Especially welcome here is a new recording of Daniel Lentz's ""Song(s) of the Sirens,"" an exquisite older work whose premiere recording has been out-of-print for some time. While the pieces presented are well-crafted and certainly well-played, some seem a bit brief or slight on material. Still, a worthwile addition to the collection of any listener tired of standard contemporary fare."
4,happy endings,"My expectations were very low for this book, becuase it started out slow, but once you get into it, its a really beautiful story. It depicts the life in the theater, and the hardships and stories that you may never know are going when the curtain falls. Although light reading, the book really captures the unity people find when they all share a common goal. This book is real-- it does not necessarily end with ""comeuppance"" and shows us that not all things were meant to be. A definite book worth reading!"
2,burns on sensitive areas of the body,"smells good but it burns my face and other sensitive areas of the body. works ok on the arms and legs though. would definitely not buy againEDIT: The company contacted me and said it's only for the body, not the face. It still burned sensitive areas of my body."
1,what is this,THIS SMELLS LIKE U RUBBING BEER ON YOUR SKIN WHO WOULD BUY THIS I DONT WANNA SMELL LIKE A JUNKY
5,Amazing value in this deceptively simple cover...,"Just received this book a week ago and I am astounded at the great information. The book has 2 kinds of recipes: make quickly using frozen staples (""From the Freezer""), and prepare now to freeze & eat later (""For the Freezer""). All of the For the Freezer recipes have detailed instructions on how to defrost and serve, including any additional touches than can be added.Unlike many of the other make-ahead books I've seen, this one uses no prepared products in its ingredients - no cheez wiz, no ""cake mix"", nothing like that. This keeps costs down and nutrition way UP!All recipes have a cost breakdown which is helpful more for general reference to compare recipes against each other, but still a great bit of info.Finally, nutrition info is given for each recipe. A fantastic resource!"
4,Freezer FRIEND!,Useful and tasty recipes. Book was in okay condition - shipped promptly - would recommend for those who live alone or have ample time to invest in cooking ahead!
4,fram quality,"didnt want to spend a fortune on an oil filter at the local auto supply store so i searched on amazon.com for one. great price, same fram quality you would expect."
4,One Part of an Excellent Series,"The Store is the 2nd book in the T.S. Stribling Vaiden series. I've already reviewed the first book, The Forge, and most everything I have to say about this book was summed up in that review. The rating has been raised, as a result of the fact that I'm currently about 1,500 pages into the series and am nowhere near ready for it to be over. That's saying something.One thing that was different in this book was that there was a new fat character, and apparently her entirely personality was that of 'fat'. Seriously, he actually wrote :""I don't know,"" she called back flabbily, ""I might want something to eat.""How exactly does a person speak 'flabbily'?"
1,Haldeman Versus Haldeman,"James Haldeman spent 8 years on the internet promoting a deeper understanding of the Mollie Maguire issue, and his book reflects his interest in the subject. Then he spent the next ten years calling the Mollies murderers on the internet and contradicting everything he wrote in the book. Obviously the man has some serious issues. The book itself is a thrashy collection of meaningless tales which reflect Haldeman's unorganized mental processes, and the reviews that are listed here have all been written by himself under various pen names. There is not a genuine review among them. Avoid this book."
1,no cigar,"Panther Valley Tales is a collection of poems, newspaper articles, and short fiction of the type usually found in those terrible vanity press books ... a really horrible mish mash of tortured prose. There are a few interesting pieces, like The Mark of Innocence, but on the whole this is a ""book"" to be avoided like the plague."
4,Direct Energy Conversion--excellent even though Out of Print,"Stanley Angrist does an excellent job of explaining how we convert heat, light and other things into electricity. Although this is an old book, it covers the subject really well. I have used this to teach a course at FIT called ""Space Power Systems.""He covers batteries, fuel cells, photovoltaic, thermoelectric, thermionic, radioisotope thermoelectric generators, magneto hydrodynamic generators, fission and fusion. It is written for the science literate, and he explains the basics of quantum physics as it applies to power generation very well."
5,pure power,"I grew up listining to late 60's and 70's rock, the Who, the Stones, the Godz, Aerosmith, Yes, Bad Company, etc., so I did not expect to like this CD. I was familiar with a 70's band called GIRL whose lead singer was Phil Lewis. While browsing the racks at my local music store, I noticed Phil's name on the back of this L.A. Guns CD and, curious to hear what he sounds like today, purchased the CD. I must admit, I was pleasantly surprised. This CD rocks. Thundering drums and plenty of catchy vocals and driving guitar riffs. Straight forward, fun, hard driving rock that gets you moving. Highly recomended."
1,"Tracii, please come back!","i've been a big L.A.Guns fan for a long time. they have some great songs & some pretty solid albums. but the fact is, this album stinks. the songs are awful. the production is bad & when Tracii left he definitely took the raw rock edge with him. it's really funny to hear Phil criticize other great bands (Alice In Chains, STP & so on) as of late. especially after this release. i don't know... it's just really hard for me to take a pouting middle aged man in a fishnet shirt seriously... whatever."
1,Garbage!!,"I own this book. It's a waste of money since it's really an ""introduction"" to cell biology. All the data contained are superficial and aberrant from medical course."
4,rare book,"we guess this is a rare book, since it's selling for over 2,000 dollars. we got it for five dollars, and am now are thinking we should have got five copies if it's selling for so much. But the book itself was great. It's our favorite in the caroline years.Nataley and Susanna"
4,There is missing documentation from this book.,"While this book is absolutely full of common sense and seeming authenticity about doggie nutrition and habits, we need to know about the pedigree of the writer! Is he a vet? How does he know such detailed information? For example, daily feeding of 4.4 g protein, 1.3 g fat and 10.1 g carbohydrates per 1kg doggie weight is recommended. I'm usually willing to go along with such advice when I know it's source of authority. Another very significant omission - I would like a list of artists and titles for the wonderful prints included in the book, some are familiar, some not, but all are quite interesting. Isn't such credit to sources mandatory?In summary, the recipes were good, this reader wants more information!"
4,good,this is the best streetball game i have played. the gameplay is not to unrealistic and yet not to realistic.the only downside is that the story is a bit weak.
3,"Crippling load times, unhelpful menus","The game is somewhat fun, overall, but the load times are torture. Also, there is a free roaming aspect in the shopping districts, but the camera never changes, so you can't rotate your direction (you can't see behind anything, and they frequently hide things behind objects). Why can't you know what's new in your wardrobe? I stopped trying to equip different clothes and shoes and such because of how long it takes to scroll between wardrobe changes, merely to see what a new item gave you in terms of benefits to stats. If you liked the first Ballers, you'll probably like this one, if only for a little while. I bought it 75% off, and am glad I did. If you love the soundtrack, they throw in a CD of it, which is nice--I love the two NFL Street soundtracks and wish they'd done that."
3,Save your money,"I bought this game about a week ago. I had not purchased the prequil (sp?) to this game and did not know what to expect.I began playing the game and immediately got bored about 30-45 minutes later. I have no played the game since. Here's why:The graphics, to me, are ridiculously annoying. It makes the game feel so unrealistic. The graphics are a step lower than ""NBA Street"" and even more unrealistic. The real problem is that there is just nothing to do. You enter tournements and they all feel the same. The little side missions are laughable, and I feel like turning off my Ps2 and smashing the controller on my head repetitively everytime I play one of them.I can go on and on about why I hated this game. But I won't. The bottom line is that I strongly urge you not to waste your money. The cover and appearance of the game appealed to me and made me want to buy the game...but don't let that happen to you."
4,pretty good,"It was well wrapped and got to my box very soon. It smells good and lathers well I guess, but I swear this company makes the trial size sample versions of the same thing more concentrated or something. The trial size smelled MUCH better and sweeter than this did..a little dissapointed"
4,Early to Rise,"I bought this shower gel off of Amazon.com. It comes in a large size, and the price per ounce is reasonable. You only need about a quarter sized amount of the product on a shower sponge to get a good lather. My skin does not feel dry when I use this. My only problem with this product is that I do not enjoy the scent. It smells more like menthol than the sweet peppermint scent I was hoping for. The tingly feeling is supposed to be ""invigorating,"" but it just annoys me. I would not purchase this product again, however I will continue to try other products from the Kiss My Face Line."
1,Not what I expected,I did not get the product I expected. I got a Clove and Ylang Ylang scent. Picture was very misleading. Don't like to be tricked into buying something different.
3,It Makes No 'Scents',"I've tried Kiss My Face products before and found this particular one to be a bit disappointing in the fragrance department. I wanted a shower gel with a more intense and lasting patchouli scent. It's very light and vanishes as soon as you get out of the shower. Even in the shower all I can really smell is the soap base, which has it's redeeming qualities as far as it's effectiveness to cleanse your skin and leave it very soft. If you're looking for a gel with a lingering scent, forget this one."
5,This is one of the nicer bath products. ...,"This is one of the nicer bath products. It gives a mountain of cloud-like bubbles to lay back under, along with a gentle scent that isn't overpowering. After a few minutes, laying in the warm luxury of this bath, I could feel my muscles relax and a feeling of calm take place. A tip to the new user -- go gently with putting the product in. My husband dumped some into his tub not expecting bubbles and he said he was overcome by them. The aroma is refreshing, not sweet nor overpowering. This is a plus in my book."
3,I was very excited to receive my recent ...,"I was very excited to receive my recent Test Drive. The product is a nice green color and texture, the scent was decent, but I couldn't quite place it, and best of all it wasn't irritating to my skin. I used it both in the shower and for a relaxing bubble bath."
2,I was quite surprised by this product when ...,"I was quite surprised by this product when it arrived. I could smell it through the box when I opened the front door -- and so could the mailman! So let's start there -- the scent. In one word, yuck. It's very strongly scented, and heavily perfumed. We use a lot of Kiss My Face products and I was shocked to find that this one was scented so heavily. I know that scent is a personal taste issue, but be aware that this is strong. As far as lather and such, I did wash my hands with it and found it gave a nice lather and clean rinse, which is typical of KMF products. However, I was unable to shower or bathe with it due to the scent. I will continue to buy KMF products, but not in the Peaceful Patchouli scent."
1,Do Not Waste Your Money on This,"I used to like, Kiss My Face products and love a foamybath. Thhis bottle spurted out hardly any foam andthere is no oil in it I can find. I dont know if I justgot a bad bottle but as it is rather expensive I amsorry I wasted my money on it. I could go to the drugstore and get any cheap brand and get more out of itthan I did this brand and for far cheaper prices.Just my opinion."
2,Peaceful what?,"Although it says it is Peaceful Patchouli, the lack of patchouli scent leaves one less than peaceful. Also the product does not sud, of course this could be our water here, but there are bar soaps that are far better. If this was as good as their hand wash, which does have a stronger scent and it suds up better, this would be a more desireable product."
5,This had a strong scent when opened (probably ...,"This had a strong scent when opened (probably because of the concentration) but smelled very nice in use. This is a soothing, gentle product. Great results both in the shower and bath, and my family's sensitive skin loved it! My toddler took one sniff and jumped into the bath with me -- of course THEN we had to pull those wet clothes off. Another wonderful Kiss My Face product!"
3,This product definitely falls into the aromatherapeutic category ...,This product definitely falls into the aromatherapeutic category as its name states. It has an invigorating scent and feeling. It seems as though every pore it touches opens up for a refreshing feeling.
1,art photography,"So the premise of this cute little book is the overlapping or merged ground between art and erotica. By and large the photos are a success. the woman and settings photographed are truly beautiful, sometimes as art, sometimes as erotica, and usually as both. Some of the women have what is best described as an unusual beauty, as do some of the backdrops. There are a phenomenal number of models from the eastern block. One of the memorable backdrops is of an eastern european or russian forest which has been leveled for timber, leaving a sea of stumps... I can recommend this book as a very nice addition to either a photography book collection or a collection devoted to an appreciation of the female form."
5,how amazing to look,"I was shocked to see that amazon will allow the image of a naked woman on the cover of this book to be shown, I'm not complaining. This book is about showing models nude but it's nothing sexualy it's just a piece of art only mature adults should read this book."
4,"Excellent photos, but a but uneven","The photos are of excellent quality and there are certainly plenty of photographs in this book. A wide range of models and photographers are showcased and for a rather small in size (dimensions) book, it makes up for it in the number of pages. The quibble I have with the book is that there is a certain repetition in the posing of the beautiful models, and each model is not given the same number of shots. Each model seemed to be in a single theme setting; all on the beach, or all among trees, among grasses, etc. Some of the models get much more space than others. Only one set of photographs is by Stobblehouse himself. I was surprised to find myself thinking repetition when viewing the book, but that is what I felt. I wanted to see more from some, and less from others. That is what stops me from giving it five stars. The poses are all taken outside, and show an excellent use of light and shadow."
4,what a book!,"This book is small measuring approximatly 7.5 inches by 5.5 inches. The photos are all shot in an outdoor setting and are extremely well done. This displays the ""DOMAI-style"" simple nudes with a balance of tastefulness and artfulness. There is no hardcore material in this book.This is one of the best displays of nude photography that I have seen."
5,DOMAI beauty,I have followed nude female photography and art for some time now and have found Eolake's presentations to be tasteful and show the real innocent beauty of the female form.
2,White girl bonanza!,"If you consider natural beauty to consist of caucasian women with twenty-four to twenty-six inch waists, small breasts, and generally the same facial features who don't wear make up and frolic nakedly in nature, then this book is for you. I was sorely dissappointed by the lack of variety of women shown in this book. They all look the same! The woman on the cover is pretty much what every woman inside looks like, just with a variety of hair colors and styles.That said, the photography is well done and the book itself is nicely put together. Its quite thick, with only a minimal amount of writing to introduce it. Without the variety, however, I'm afraid this book isn't going to get much handling from me or my spouse, so all the pretty photos are essentially a waste."
2,Naked skinny white teenagers,"The ""natural"" beauty in this is the artificial current Western ideal - very young, skinny, white, usually with make-up, with natural hair shaved away, placed in the out-doors, acting only moderately seductive. Mid-way between Playboy and a nudist camp for teen girls.If that's your thing, you may love this book. If you're looking for something more, you should probably pass."
3,This book could have been great but...,"Sadly this book which could have been great has been let down by it's small format. The book contains a lot of wonderful images, but are greatly diminished by the small size of this book. This book should have been printed in a coffee table format size, if it had been it might have been extraordinary. I do think this book contains some lovely images but they are, well, small."
2,Mixed bag,"I found the quality of the photography ran the entire gamut from the very amature effort that almost anyone with a point-and-shoot camera could accomplish to some exceptionally professional work. Unfortunately, there was too little of the latter.I was, however, pleasantly surprized to see tht there was little of an overtly soft-porn mode. It seems that too much of the new ""nextdoor beauties"" photography is just a thinly-veiled, soft-porn eroticism. Still, there was little that would be considered fine art. But, then again, as the author says, that's not the purpose of the book. Just nice pictures of pretty naked girls. It works."
5,Natural Beauties with Natural Light...,"As a glamour and nude photographer myself, I purchased this book for ideas and inspiration--I was not dissatisfied at all. I love the use of natural lighting, sometimes less means more and this book packs more than most if you're a connoisseur of natural beauty. I recommend anyone interested in this type of photography, buy it now!As an author ofGarage Glamour: Digital Nude and Beauty Photography Made Simple, andRolando Gomez's Glamour Photography: Professional Techniques and ImagesI recommend this book should not only be on a collector's list, but for any student of photography--we're always learning no matter what level your photography. ---Rolando Gomez, contributing writer, Studio Photography magazine"
4,A lover of enjoyable French singing,She really does have a light touch that has been refreshing ever since I found out about her (which wasn't until the late 80's).
5,Beautiful first record,"Jane's first record without Gainsbourg,at first I was reluctant to order it but she surprised me,this is one of the most beautiful records she ever has done,Philippe Lerichomme did wizardy with the arrangements,the cover is great,and C'est comme ca,the last song of the record should be one of the most beautiful and touching songs i've ever heard."
3,"Fun idea, poor execution","This is the sort-of sequel to the PS1 game Azure Dreams. I loved the dungeon crawler growing up, so I decided to pick this game up. The story seems interesting and true to the original, the dungeon changes every time you enter it, adding another level of challenge.Unfortunately, they tried to use the DS touch screen as the only method of moving or acting in game. The lower screen has a circle with arrows which will make you walk in different directions, and buttons you can use to open spell and attack menus. While this sounds exciting, they also installed a delay in controls so you cannot act smoothly, you must tap, tap, tap arrows in order to move, while watching the map on the upper screen. This only serves to make an already semi-slow dungeon crawler feel even slow and clunky.The game has some interesting and very fun features, unfortunately I could not get past the painfully slow chore of just walking from place to place and did not get very far in the game."
2,Boring attempt at RPG,"This game is a weak attempt at an RPG. I was highly unimpressed with the graphics, music, and the storyline. You're basically a young kid whose gifted with magic, and you're family is turned to stone by a giant crow. You need to travel to the Monster Tower (yes, it's actually called that) to find the monster that turned your family into stone. The dialog quickly (first 5 minutes) becomes tiresome, and the fight sequences are sadly put together. If you're a small child, and you haven't played the quality RPG's like Final Fantasy you may think this game is good. I can tell you that as an adult this game was a waste of money. Avoid it, unless you really enjoy completely monotonous gameplay, with bad music and terribly translated Japanese (your companions are called Familiars)."
2,too smooth,"From a very diverse body of work this is definitely not his best. Too smooth for my liking and leaning too far to the pedestrian. Some great players but they don't do much playing. Well suited to smooth jazz radio, so it may appeal to some listeners."
3,Europa...Smooth Jazz? NOT!,"The rest of the album maybe, but Europa (from the guy who wrote it) as smooth Jazz? Kenny G would trip out! I do agree the album is not his best. I loved his first (and unavailable in CD) ""TC""."
5,In Color restored,Insiders say that the first cd release of In Color was based on a defective master tape! This remastered version restores the original brilliance of this power pop masterpiece. Don't miss it!
5,Not Power-Pop,"I love classic metal from the 70's and 80's. I had heard people talk about Cheap Trick over the years, but they always seemed to call them ""power pop"". This turned me off about them because I'm a diehard hard rock fan. I bought ""In Color"" to try it out. I would like to know, if these people where listening to the same band I was? This was just simple glam metal. It was full of hard rock. The band is great. The songs are glam metal or pop metal, not pop rock. They are a heavy group. I guess people think if you write catchy songs, you can't be a heavy band. Wrong. Cheap Trick is great for hard rock junkies."
2,An unexpected disappointment from Kaplan,"If you're interested in succeeding on the AP English exam then this book isn't the way to go. I took the exam last week and I can conclude from my newfound knowledge of the exam that if you have common sense, you can do the multiple choice section. The free response section, however, requires practice throughout the school year-if you have a good teacher then you have nothing to be worried about. The literary terms in the Apex book are out of this world-I'm serious too. Sorry, but I didn't see buildungsroman on the test. I can suggest the Cliff's notes book though (I didn't buy it but my teacher had it and they have a great literary terms list). I will give this book praise where praise is due: it has three practice tests-but you can get them free from your teacher. My final wise words of advice are-if you're going to study, start in late March at the very latest."
5,Wow!,The book arrives on time. I need it for a class. Thanks so much for the quality of the book and the fast shipment.
4,Mosley,"This is the first Walter Mosley book I read and, as a debut novel, it impressed me with its atmosphere and noir-ish intent. I have already ordered two more Mosley books on the strength of this one."
4,"If You Like Noir Mysteries, Try This One on For Size","Walter Moseley is one talented writer. This book felt real. No way would I have guessed it was the first book in a series. He really captured the feel of 1940's L.A. in a Chandleresque fashion. I had to check to see when the book was written and was surprised that it wasn't written in the 1940's. Noir mysteries aren't my favorite genre, but if they are for you, this may be a 5 star plus read for you. I lost track of the plot line and some of the characters, but maybe that's part of the charm of noir mysteries. Easy, the protagonist, was the only likable main character in this book for me. He is a great character. If you like the sordid underbelly of 1940's L.A. as a setting and inspired writing, try this book."
3,the race issue yet again,"From beginning to end, Devil in a Blue Dress deals with race issues in a rather unique way. The very first line in the book draws a line between the worlds of white and black persons. Writing this book from a black man's perspective creates an even more powerful story in the sense that the reader can see the struggle that this individual endures simply to find a sense of freedom. In the narrator's sharp wit and humor, one can see the intelligence in this man, but yet this intelligence cannot fully be expressed because the worlds of the whites and blacks have a difficult time connecting...."
3,Hard to accommodate,"Great character(Easy Rollins), good story, fine writing. It is, however, a wonder how Easy has the stamina to get out of the house in the morning with a racist around every corner and two in every doorway. Perhaps pervasive racism was the environment in the LA of the forties, but it is one I can neither identify with or want to be part of. I was feeling accused, and at times convicted. I don't think I will be accommodating Easy's reluctant career, no matter how fine the writing."
3,"Somewhat overwritten, but I've seen much worse.","Walter Mosley, Devil in a Blue Dress (Pocket, 1990)Walter Mosley's first novel featuring detective Easy Rawlins is a good one; the characters are well-drawn, the plot is solid, the pace fast. This is good beach reading; quick, easy, digestible. Mosley's style grates on the nerves now and again, especially when the exclamation points rear their ugly heads in inappropriate places, but that's ultimately forgivable in the greater scheme of things. Worth a look for mystery fans who haven't yet been introduced to Mosley. ***"
3,Not Free SF Reader,"Easy Rawlins is an ex-military man looking to get by after the war. He loses his job, and is looking to do something else to pay the bills. He falls into a private investigator type of job, being asked to track down a white woman that likes to hang out in black clubs.It is all not quite as simple as that of course. Time for some music, violence, and the other usual bits and pieces."
3,A mixed bag...,"I have mixed feelings about this one. The dialogue was very good, the setting was interesting and well-drawn, and the mystery aspect was good, too. The problem is that I never cared what happened to any of the characters because I couldn't connect with any of them. I think that's partly due to the fact that there we so many of them and the novel is only 219 pages long--there just wasn't enough time to get to know them. I felt sympathy for Easy and understood how trapped he was by societal attitudes and his circumstances, but I didn't like him much. I don't think I'll be reading any more of this series."
4,Pretty Good,"I read this particular novel in about a week and at first it seemed slow, but towards the middle part of the book my interest started to peak. The protagonist Easy Rawlins a fired aircraft worker and WWII veteran gets pulled into a world of deceit by a person he perceives to be a good friend. Easy is hired to look for a woman by the name of Daphne Monet, but everyone he comes in contact with that could possible help him is murdered. Finally Easy starts putting the pieces of the puzzle together with his long time friend Mouse and in the end everything makes sense. The books tangles a serious web of deception which is rather interesting. I would definitely recommend this book to anyone."
2,Buy it if you love racism,"This book has a reasonably good story, for a murder mystery. Buy it if you enjoy being assailed by barrages of black racism on every other page."
3,needs a good edit,The book held my interest for about 75% of the time. I did not enjoy the boring digressions into sociological statistics. Otherwise quite readable.
2,Decent Nonfiction,"""Bestial"" starts off with a promising and disturbing account of one of the earliest known serial killers. However, Schechter finishes this story and moves on to the main character of this book--Nelson the ""Gorilla Man"".This serial killer may have been the most frightening thing to ever happen to people in the 20's but a gorilla man? How scary is that?Schechter's quick account of some of the other killers were far more enticing and gruesome. Nelson's crimes were neither unusual or fascinating, except for his habit of eating his meals like a horse off his plate. The author's detailed account of all the killings were tedious and tiresome with the same M.O. and results."
2,Bestial,Book looked interesting. Ordered it used but would have prefered to order it new. When I got it there was a huge sticker on the front which was disappointing. Would have ordered it new if I knew it was going to look very used.
5,Harold Schechter is an amazing author,"I have now read quite a few of the books written by Harold Schechter and think he is truly gifted in writing these types of true crime stories. He does a good job of setting up how the criminals got to their breaking point. The middle of the book is all about the time when the crimes happened in a different type of narrative - more like a reporter describing what was found and not necessarily why it happened. The last part is how he ends up getting caught and the legal process of trying to convict an actual monster. Overall, I thoroughly enjoy reading his true crime profiles."
3,good book,"it's a good book, what i keep forgetting is that the events that happend.. happend so long ago.. its a good read"
4,"Disturbing! Once again, Schechter satisfies!","Reviewer: Shari P. American Fork, UTSchechter is the master of true crime! Once again he writes an incredibly well researched & smartly written account of ""The Gorilla Man."" With little trustworthy info available about Nelson, Schechter somehow manages to paint a vivid & frightening portrait of the disturbed & ""bestial"" dark strangler. A true phsychopath who will continually astound you with his cruelty & complete lack of remorse or accountability. Insane? I'm still not sure...But one thing is clear; the man was sick!"
3,Kindle version full of typos,"Harrowing story about one of America's earliest serial killers, but I was extremely disappointed at the number of typos in the Kindle version. There were so many it was impossible to overlook them. In fact the half the time time the word ""in"" should appear it was misspelled ""hi."" Ferral's name was often misspelled. There's just no excuse for this kind of shoddy transcription."
5,Would Make A Superb Film,"This incredible, but true story is so well written that one really wishes Hitchcock were alive to capture it's alluring power on film. And I really think that's what makes this book a great and unforgettable journey. I've read two others by the talented Mr. Schecter, both hard to put down, but this one is so deviously fascinating and consistantly well documented. It's not only a well researched piece of journalism, but a bonified shock treatment that lingers long after you've finished it. Highly recommended for crime buffs. And young film-makers please take note: ""Saw"" and ""Hostel"" are sheer piffle compared to the hideous life of Earl Leonard Nelson. Truth really is stranger than fiction."
4,I love Wodehouse,"The volume begins with Bertie taking a trip to the doctor for some spots. The visit ends with the doctor reccomending that Bertie get away from the busy city life and relax in the county--it could be a matter of life or death. And so Bertie tries to escape to the quiet life--except life has something else in mind. He finds himself in the midst of his Aunt Dahlia's gambling over local horses; Simola and Potato Chip.Potato Chip has grown deeply attached to a local cat and is unable to race, due to his melancholy if the cat is absent. Bertie, trying his best not to get sucked into his aunt's machinations over throwing the race, naturally does. It's funny and light hearted, not some of my favorite characters, but still its lovely Wodehouse and what more do I need?"
4,Spy thriller,"My only issue with Le Carre ooks is the fact that I do not speak the King's English and he writes in that language. That said, it is a good book: good character development, story and writing."
2,BORING.,"I'm a huge LeCarre fan, and this effort is so boring I stopped reading half-way thru. Its not his finest book. I wouldnt list it in his best 10."
4,Not Free SF Reader,"A Small Town in Germany gets it title from somewhere that really isn't. In this case, Le Carre means Bonn, the capital of West Germany in this era.A British government official journeys to said 'small town' to look into the disappearance of another official, and also perhaps the 'misplacing' of some important secret documents."
5,"Ordering book ""A Small Town in Germany"" by John LeCarre",I received the book that I ordered through Amazon.com in a prompt and timely manner. The book was in excellent condition. Am very satisfied.
1,Terrible thermometer,"We bought this thermometer before our daughter was born in hopes to never use it. I know silly parents. Well, she came down with her first cold/bug and we needed it. The thermometer did not perform very well. We must have tried to get a reading 10 times and few readings were the same. A sick child does not want their temp. taken numerous times at once and does not want their ears to be tugged on. I do not recommend this product and will be returning ours today."
1,Totally Ineffective,Received this for my impending son as a baby shower gift. My 11 year old daughter was sick with the flu so I decided to get it out and give it a try. I tried over and over with the same disappointing results. The thermometer was always 2 degrees too low. She didn't like having her ear tugged on so I can imagine how a infant will react especially when sick. I would not recommend this product and will be taking it back.
1,Never the same temp and never right!,"We bought this thermometer before our daughter was born. Well, since we've had it, it's never correct. We can also measure her temp 3 times in 30 seconds and get three different temps that vary by 2-3 degrees! We've checked it on ourselves and used a standard basal body temperature thermometer as a comparision and it's ALWAYS at least 5 degrees low! Don't buy this one. It's horrible!"
2,Disappointed,"I received this set for a shower gift and have been unhappy with it. It's not worth $29.99 thats for sure. The darn oral/rectal thermometer didn't even work. After reading the other reviews of this, I see I am not the only one who had trouble with it. I have had it open for a few months now, before I ever had to use it, so it's too late to take back or else I would.As for the ear thermometer, it has given me fairly consistent temps. The only things I do not like about it is that it came with probe covers that you have to replace. 5 years from now when I still have the thermometer they may not be making the probe covers as replacements. Summary...it's on OK ear thermomter, but not great. The smaller one is a big joke, make sure to have another one as back up."
1,VERY DISAPPOINTED,This was one of the first things I registered for. I was so excited to get one of these thinking it would help during those rough nights and give me a quick and accurate reading. But I was COMPLETELY disappointed. My son has had 4 ear infections within the last 10 weeks and not once did it give me a reading over 94 degrees. I have even changed the battery thinking that was the cause of this. The first time I used it I got a great reading. But that was the one and only time. Last night when he was sick again and were were struggling to get him to calm down I was once again disappointed with a reading of 93 degrees. I am throwing it away and have started to research another brand on line to get reviews before I buy another one.
2,WON'T DO YOU ANY GOOD......,Our doctor recommended a more accurate reading that you get from a standard thermometer.
1,A very bad choice!,"This thermometer gives me a different reading every time. Now that I've had it a while it doesn't give me a temperature at all. It just gives me a ""L"" for low. This is a waste of money."
5,Great one,"Great Instructional Blues Finger picking DVDif u are a beginner in acoustic blues and want to go to an intermediate level this is the right DVD to Purchase.It introduces the finger picking style and takes you up to be a fairly accomplished blues finger picker player.I really enjoyed this DVD, from 1 year now I'm still learning from it.If u r really serious about playing the Blues don't miss this DVD a lot of instructions far more advanced than the first one, but if u r a novice just start with the first one."
4,It's Good,"I bought this book believing that i'll find information about from where H2S come, how it change through time, How it can be monitoring through time, but these questions are not answered. Instead of that you'll find a good book about how handle well oerations with h2s present. Yes, it's said on the title but maybe a little theory for people who work as Petroleum engineer trying to monitoring H2S could be interesting because there aren't book about that. I recommend this book for Operational engineers."
2,Too Many Typos!,I purchased the Kindle version of this book and had to return it. It was virtually unreadable due to the typos. I then bought a different Kindle version which was much better. Download the free sample before you buy.
2,Poor Print Job,"I had seen so much written about John W. Hardin that I thought it would be interesting to see what he had written about himself. At first I ordered the Kindle edition, but was very disappointed in it. Whoever scanned in the text never took the time to proofread it afterwards. As a result, much of it is illegible and most of it is annoying. I finally ended up ordering the written copy instead."
3,"Good, not great","Historicaly accurate, a book worth reading if you are interested in the life of Hardin.Just as a novel on it' own it was not a page turner."
3,Eh.,"He went here, had to kill someone. Then he went somewhere else, had to kill someone. It goes on and on like that for quite a while. You'll get a decent flavor of the times, but as far as it being a thrilling story to read, not so much. I gave it three stars for the flavor of the times, but it isn't such a great story.I bought this version over the less expensive public domain version because we are told it had been proofed and edited, but there are a handful of typos. I can't say you might as well save your money and buy the public domain version because I haven't seen it and don't know how bad the typos are in that version. But the story isn't good enough to read twice and compare typos. If the editor will fix the typos and send me a new copy, I'd be glad to update my review."
2,Mediocre,"The autobiography of John Wesley Hardin would be illuminating if it were not one long tedious, blow-by-blow account of the man's life. Even though there is a brawl, a gunfight, or a mad chase on nearly every page the book manages to be excruciatingly dull. The reason? Stilted, cumbersome, self-absorbed writing. It is hard to find value in this work even as primary source history because there is not really much history there."
1,Nonsense,"Anyone expecting the truth from a bush-wacking convict deserves to waste their money on this book he wrote.Oh, indeed, he was reformed. That lasted until 18 months or so.His bush-wacking ran out on him in El Paso.February 17, 1894 Released from prison:January 9, 1895: Married a 15-year-old girl named Callie Lewis; Hardin was 42-years old.August 19, 1895: Shot deader than a hammer by El Paso lawman John Selman, Jr."
2,Good Read - Below Average Quality,"I own this autobiography in a regular hardcopy and the Kindle version. It is an excellent read and well written by John Wesley Hardin himself. Unfortunately, the Kindle version contains a number of character glitches which create a minor nuisance throughout the book, and in a few places makes whole sentences unreadable. The price isn't too bad and the text is mostly readable, but in this case I would recommend the hardcopy."
4,well worth reading,"Although this book is far from objective and the author tries to justify the many murders that he commited, this is still a good book for someone interested in western history or western gunfighters. John Wesley Hardin was possibly the most notorious and most prolific killer of the era.While this book is not the most objective it does give a good insight into the subject's thinking. It is also the only way to track Mr. Hardin through some periods of his life"
4,Nuwine Is Off Tha Hook!,"Never heard of this cd? That's not surprising. When I first saw this cd listed here on Amazon, I instantly purchased it. The buy was definitely worth it, because the tracks are off the hook. There are 14 tracks, consisting of:1) As Tha World Turns (Featuring Lil' Raskull, Krokett, Cutty, and Stephanie)2) Dead Man Walkin' (Featuring Krockett)3) Free (Featuring Black Seed)4) Guitar Slim5) Nuwine6) Pocket Book7) He Diggin' (Featuring Rehab)8) Turn To You9) Color Blind10) Comin' Soon (Featuring Roc A)11) Prophesy12) Do That13) Where's Yo Name Now (Featuring Stephanie)14) OutroThe best tracks without a doubt are ""Dead Man Walkin'"" (Featuring Krockett and Cutty), ""Do That"", and ""Free"" (Featuring Black Seed). Track 10, ""Comin' Soon"", is produced by Roc A, who also produced for Lil' Raskull. As Tha World Turns 2 is a pure example of the gangsta-ness of Nuwine, and is a must for any Nuwine fans. For more on Nuwine.... Get this cd, because it won't be around long!"
3,BSB Kevin CD Review,"This CD has a couple songs on it, plus an interview but if you want to buy a great import album I would not recommend this single. The interview is weak cause it's dated, the songs are decent but average at best. This is cool if you are a BSB collector or a true BSB fan."
5,Very adventurous women!,"This is an amazing account, by two very adventurous women, of their time spent in an extremely remote area of this country. Even with the speed of modern automobile travel, the tiny communities along the Klamath River, in Humboldt & Siskiyou Counties of northern California, are still remote. Mary & Mabel's sense of adventure, humor, tolerance & joy radiate from this book. It's been 20 years since I lived near the Company Ranch, in Orleans, and read this story. I'm looking forward to owning my own copy and re-reading it. Another reader recommended a wonderful book of similar format. It's exact title is ""Tisha: the story of a young teacher in the Alaskan wilderness"". It is available through Amazon. I lent my copy several years ago; it's time to buy another copy and re-read it, too. These books are very difficult to find in bookstores. Thank you, Amazon."
1,1 cent book provides 3 cents worth of laughs...,The only problem is even though it's only a penny you'd still have to pay $2-$3 shipping. Not worth it! Funny book written by a sweaty little fat kid with crazy Christian conservative parents. Hearing a 14 year old virgin boy's opinion on abortion is great. And it's all yours for only one penny!
2,"Funny, but mislabeled","It's troubling--I was in a bookstore recently and saw this thing, picked it up, read a few chapters, and had a good chuckle. It's supposed to be about a young teen in the 'American heartland' who takes on all kinds of issues dominating the headlines. He points to a left-wing trend in many things, and he's a bit concerned.Unfortunately, the book was misfiled in the 'Current Events' section of the store, and when I tried to point this out, the staff looked at me like I had six heads.It's good to pick up a 'Humor' book now and then. Just make sure your local bookstore properly files things."
1,Unoriginal.,"Once the novelty of this book coming from the youngest political pundit has worn off, it's sadly derivative. Anyone familiar with contemporary conservative ideology can easily follow his train of thought, to the point where it's possible to predict what he's going to say next even before turning the page. I suppose there's something to be said for having strongly-held beliefs, but a fourteen-year old shouldn't be this grim--even someone that conservative."
1,1-Star because there is no ZERO option,"I used to get depressed about the youth of America when I'd hear about some kid using drugs or committing violent crime. But the horrid ramblings of this kid scare me A LOT more. Frightening to think that this mindless git might actually have some sort of influence on anyone. Hate-mongering starts early with home-schooled kids, I guess. DO NOT SUPPORT THIS LUNACY."
1,Who's his ghostwriter?,I've read some of his pieces online and part of his book and I doubt he's thinking up these opinions by himself. He's just regurgitating what he's heard on the radio.
1,Someone needs to get a girlfriend.....,"Kyle Williams has been regarded as prodigy of some sort. You could consider him Rush Limbaugh's ""mini-me."" His writing is nothing more than a novelty act. Like a trained monkee, he goes through the pundit motions: bashing gays, social programs, etc..His approach is comparable to other ""Shock Jock"" personalities like Michael Savage and Joe Scarborough. He makes dramatic statements and offers very little factual information to emphasize his point. His lack of ""real life"" experience is evident in his lack of tolerance for diversity and culture. This book is nothing more than the diatribe of a young child with an exceptional ability to rehash the kind of rhetoric prevalent in the talk radio scene. What a joke!!!!!"
1,more rightwing myth-mongering,"Ever notice how many media elitists -- and government power brokers -- run around whining about a ""liberal agenda,"" despite the fact that the Executive Branch, Supreme Court, congress, Pentagon and cable news outlets are in fact pursuing a rather overt ""rightwing agenda"" with its own jackbooted political correctness?This product of rural Oklahoma -- and I say this as a proud descendent of Okies -- is simply a pawn in a culture war promulgated by reactionary forces who decided they needed a kid's face to spew more of their divisive, freedom-hating agenda around the country..."
2,Not for everyone,"I suggest checking out Kyle's columns before buying the book. If you like the columns, you will like the book. If you don't care for the columns, you won't care for the book. You can look at my 2 star rating to see what I think about the columns and the book."
2,The brainwashing starts early,"Kid, why don't you grow up, go to college or, even better, put on a uniform and serve your country for a few years, gain some life experience, and when you've done all of that, come back and lecture us all on life. You'll gain some needed credibility.If you were to place this book side-by-side with Hannity's ""Let Freedom Ring"" it would almost read the same.What a shame that we don't let kids be kids anymore. Now at 13 they need to have political opinions?"
4,Haven't Read Anything but the Reviews,"I find it funny that the only political agenda as of late that the liberal left has is hurling cut-downs at everyone (including their own party). Can you not do any better than ""stupid little boy"" and ""ill informed adults"". Form some ideas and opinions of your own.How many books have you published?Pretty scary when you think that a kid having political opinions is worse than a kid committing violent crimes or doing drugs.BTW, every party has its own propaganda and agenda, to deny it would be ludicrous."
1,More a publicity stunt then an author,"I went into this book hoping to be impressed with a 13 year old writer and came out with even less hope for the youth of America. This Home schooled rightwing [author] spends his time over analyzing irrelevant points. You COULD read this book, but your time would be better spent searing your corneas with a cigar."
2,Problem: it slips off too easily,"If you carry your iPod (mine is a 160GB Classic) around by hand at all times with this sock on, it's effective at your keeping your greasy paws off the screen and controls. However, if you set it down on your lap or seat while riding the train, or rest it in your backpack, more often than not the sock will ""ride down"" exposing the screen to possible damage and scratches. It's a decently made item, but they should have added an inch of material lengthwise, so as to avoid the risks I've described."
5,"If your looking for an alternative to apple socks, this is it","i love this case because its so easy to use. Although i must say it wasn't that great of a buy because after S&H fees, it costs around 8 dollars."
4,Interesting,A very interesting movie with fair sense of interpreting evidence. Whoever made this series does not draw any religious conclusion. Instead they just provides the evidence and let the audience to make conclusions. No matter if you are religious or not I definitely suggest watching this short movie (It is only 1 hr long) for it could be educational in terms of basic cell biology.
5,"An invaluable, highly recommended reference work.","The Garland Handbook Of African Music is a single volume compilation of informative essays written by the leading scholars in the field of African music. This outstanding reference explores all aspects of African music as it explores the content and its many musical forms. Included is a thorough discussion of the issues and processes in the study of African music, illustrated by a number of regional case studies covering North, West, East, Central, and Southern Africa. The Garland Handbook Of African Music is enhanced with an accompanying 60 minute CD, a glossary, and guides to publications, recordings, films and videos. The Garland Handbook Of African Music is an invaluable, highly recommended addition to personal, professional, and academic multicultural and African music reference collections."
4,Walmart vs Amazon,"I like buying my movies from Amazon, but this time Walmart had a cheaper price for X-Men First class. Amazon should have better prices on their movies to beat walmart prices. Amazon is a great online service and shall always be.From Hugo Mattern-Ortiz"
5,X-Men: First Class,"I purchased a DVD and Blu-ray copy of this movie for Christmas presents. Although we have not viewed these yet, they arrived in perfect condition and extremely timely. I always appreciate Amazon because I know I will get a good copy of whatever I'm ordering."
1,"Disc Doesn't work, Fox puts out bad disc.","Movie is great 5 Stars there, Blue ray discs not working on many players however. Like many others here I have a PS3 and them among many other blue ray players apparently can't play this disc properly. There is a work around for the PS3 at least (which is a major PITA) unlike some other players but Fox really needs to own up to this huge mistake and fix it/pay for it. What sort of pathetic quality control lets a disc release that doesn't work on half the blue ray players out there? Even SONY players!"
2,Licensing woes?,Why would I buy a digital copy of the movie if I cannot view it after February? That is really going to make me think twice about buying any digital content from amazon in the future.
2,Ruined By A Single Line...,"Other than some blatant artistic liberty with the storyline and characters, this was overall 132 minutes of attention keeping X-Men fantasy. It was a feature I was going to enjoy watching with my kids. Unfortunately, this movie is soured by the single line uttered by Wolverine during his 4 second cameo. It could have been handled (or written) so much better to fall in line with a PG-13 feature. I'm no prude, and served in the Marine Corps, so I have heard it all, but this F-bomb is SO out of place. I just don't understand why the makers of a film marketed for fans of the comic book franchise, that includes younger kids, would feel the need to push the limits of a PG-13 rating and make it less family friendly. So disappointing. Anyone interested in a slightly used Bluray?"
2,Disappointed,"While a PG-13 movie, I was shocked at the lingerie scene and the large amount of profanity used. Even a 13 year old or older doesn't need that in a movie. The story line and special effects were good. I allowed my 9 year old to watch this movie and regretted not viewing the movie before allowing him to watch it. I nearly turned off the movie primarily due to the profanity. I didn't like the lingerie scene but that was only a small part of the movie. The profanity unfortunately persisted throughout. Needless to say, the movie has been put away and might even be given away. I wish the writers and directors would leave out the unnecessary trash and just focus on making good movies. Having excessive cursing, especially use of the f-bomb is just not necessary in any movie, much less a PG-13 movie."
5,X-cellent,"I've been an avid Marvel and X-men fan since my childhood. I grew up with the acclaimed ""90's X-Men"" cartoon (I HIGHLY recommend those on Amazon). X-Men First Class is a great comic book film despite it's lack of proper characters/timelines (most won't notice). It's the best X-Men related film thus far by far. The perfomance by Magneto is enough reason to see this. Stop reading my review and buy this already. Even most non comic/action fans (such as your girlfriend) will likely enjoy this. You also receive a credit towards Marvel digital comics, so that's another incentive. Again, I recommend."
5,X-Men First Class,"Can't Stand Kevin Bacon but love the Cold-War Angle it's too bad they can't be battling commies as well since Ideologically both GREAT EVILS WERE Cousins that differed very little,both control of the state and of labor and capital,but I digress.the movie is a story about the beginning according to Hollywood,I have never been a fan of movies going backwards or stories that later on are ""re-told"" but this is an exception,Wolverine(Favorite),Beast,And Charles Xavier.A must watch."
3,Interesting but the others were better,"I liked this installment of the X-Men just because it was X-Men, however, I believe the other movies were stronger in several different ways."
4,Enjoyable movie for all ages!,"Being a HUGE X-Men fan, owning all of the X-Men movies, I really enjoyed this movie! I saw it in theaters and really enjoyed the story and characters! The movie takes viewers back to a prequel setting, showing the story of Xavier, Magneto, and Raven (Mystique). The movie offers a great story line with a wonderful character development! A must have for any X-Men fan!"
1,X-Men First Class Blu Ray,"X-Men: First Class (+Digital Copy) [Blu-ray]Do not buy this! I purchased this movie on BluRay and experienced an endless list of issues with the disk. Fox is aware of the issue and they don't seem to care to do anything to fix it (I called them and they were quite rude). I not only had to shut off BD Live capabilities on my player and empty the cache, but I also had to plug in an external USB Key Drive into my player because the disk requires you to have at least 1GB of memory to even begin to play. I highly encourage you to read the numerous blog posts online before you buy ANY Fox BluRay Disks.To make matters worse, after I finally got the disk to play, the quality is no better than any other regular DVD. Don't waste your time or money on this product. Nothing against Amazon or X-Men, but it's a shame that fox handled this one so poorly."
5,The best Marvel movie of the year.,"Ok before you go bashing me, I do like comics. I do know quite a bit about them(although I'm no expert). I know that this movie was not overly faithful to the original story or even completely aligned with the movie trilogy. I do not care. This was one hell of a good movie. The story and acting proves that that's really all you need to make a good movie. After watching the last super-movie of the year(Cap), which was okay...I had to give this underhyped gem a fiver, cuz it deserves it! A first day buy for me."
2,Couldn't Keep My Attention,"I've been an XMan fan for years. When they made the first 3 in the series, I didn't mind the changes to the original story because they were close and had the spirit of the original. I enjoyed all 3 of the original movies, so I was eager to see this one.To say I was disappointed is an understatement. I disliked that they changed the original Marvel universe (Sebastian Shaw was a Nazi who killed Magneto's parents ??? Emma Frost is Xavier and Magneto's age? Beast is part of this first class but Iceman, Cyclops and Marvel Girl are not?). But worse than being frustrated that they strayed so far from the story we all know, the movie was just plain boring. They lost me during the 2nd half of the movie.I would not recommend this movie."
5,XMEN First Class,"excellent acting, entertaining, genuine & a fun interesting movie for all ages. It is not necessary to Be an XMEN Fan to enjoy this wonderful movie, however if you are like me; it makes the whole series of movies from Wolverine to XMEN more understandable & Fascinating. THX"
5,X-Men First Class,"I always enjoy ordering from Amazon. Whatever I order comes on time, and in perfect condition! I enjoyed this movie at the theater and now I'm happy to add it to my collection!"
4,He walks!,"Not a bad little film that once again re-invents the complex relationship between Professor X and Magneto. The story digs up heroes and villains that I'm not familiar with, such as the one-dimensional baddie Azazel from a hyper dimension, but does its best to push the metaphor of the treatment of those who are ""different"" by mainstream society. James McAvoy is good as a young non-bald Professor X who is not yet wheelchair-bound, finding his way in the world, as is Michael Fassbender as Magneto, tormented by Nazi horrors. The plot is interesting - the Hellfire Club seeking to antagonise the US and the USSR into taking up war positions against each other orchestrates what would become the Cuban Missile Crisis. Some unexpected twists and turns, and some heroic speeches later, the world is safe from nuclear war... but are mutants safe from non-mutants and vice versa? Tune in next week for... X-Men: Second Class!"
4,first clas all the way,The wovie was shipped promptley. I was impressed how the writers tieded all the other movies together in a well thought out time line.I hope to see more x-men moveis in the future!just wish they could bring back patrick stewart !I
5,"Top of their ""class""","It was great to finally know how the stories' main characters (X-MEN) all first met, their origins, how they came together, and when and where their lines of allegiance to each other divided; one side led by hatred and fear, the other, compassion and a plea for acceptance for the world."
5,Make a Magneto Movie!,"This might be the best ""X-Men"" movie of them all though I really like most of ""X-Men 2."" Michael Fassbender is so awesome as Magneto and the movie makes you want him to play James Bond next but historically. Kevin Bacon was the only bad part as it's hard to look at him and think that Magneto can't just beat him. James McAvoy wasn't as good as Patrick Stewart, but I liked how he and Fassbender interacted a lot. The scene with the radar dish especially."
4,really good movie better,"Way better than the hugh/ halle monstrosity, definitely worth seeing and you may want to purchase worth owning, nothing more to say good acting"
3,GOOD MOVIE BUT COULD OF BEEN BETTER,"THE STORY WAS GOOD BUT IT TOOK A BIT TO GET IT GOING.. BUT WHEN IT DID TAKE OFF , IT STAYED IN THE AIR.. I THINK THE SHOULD DO A BACK GROUND ON ALL THE MAIN GUYS LIKE THEY DID FOR LOGAN "" WOLVERINE"""
5,Angel,Saw this movie a week ago and loved it. Got it quick after being notified it was mailed and in perfect condition. Thank you.
4,First class prequel,"Charles Xavier (James MacAvoy) and Erik Lensherr (Michael Fassbender), two powerful mutants, band together to recruit and train young mutants to oppose their evil counterparts, ultimately splitting over methods and laying the foundation for a rivalry that will shake the world.This tremendously entertaining film manages to reboot the series without ignoring its predecessors. MacAvoy and Fassbender ably lead an otherwise hit-and-miss cast. Using the Cuban Missile Crisis of the 1960s as a backdrop was an inspired choice, giving this film a unique, retro atmosphere and leading one to speculate what other historical events may benefit from a mutant influence in future installments. Matthew Vaughn shows, as he did with ""Kick Ass,"" that he can deliver a tight, thrilling, action packed film with a sense of humor."
4,Is it a prequel or a reboot?,"The film is great, some might say the best in the series. Great action and direction, the actors did pretty good jobs in their portrayals of these somewhat under the radar X men characters. The biggest problem with the movie is I can't for the life of me figure out if it's a prequel or a reboot!!! I'm not putting any spoilers in here for those who haven't seen the movie. But for fans who've seen every X men movie to date you'll see what I mean. I just wish that this was the first EVER X men film and thus subsequently the series could've go on from here. But alas not so. Still a very enjoyable film in which you guys know will recieve it's much deserved sequels. As far as blue ray/dvd features and such, not too many to speak of besides the customary behind-the-scenes featurettes, deleted scenes (one in particular is hilarious), etc. Must buy for X men fans and action movie buffs."
4,Great movie for any X-men Fan,"In my personal opinion, this may not be the best of X-men movies so far, but I really liked the way the movie lets you understand more about Magneto and Xavier's past, great effects and nice story, if you are a fan of our mutant fellows, you should add this movie to your collection."
2,Bad subtitles. Weak action.,"The DVD author used a non-standard method of recording subtitles. This makes it impossible to use both English dialogue and other dialogue subtitles, requiring manually switching subtitle tracks mid-film and rewinding."
2,I am in the minority...,"Lots of people like this film, but I am not one of them. Yep, I'm part of the minority. And I'm probably going to get lots of negative feedback or votes of this review being non-helpful. But hey, my opinion. Anyway, I didn't really enjoy this movie very much. I like the idea of going back and showing the origins of the X-Men and the Brotherhood, but I was very confused as to whether or not this was a reboot of the X-Men films or if it was a prequel. I've heard some say it's a reboot, and I've heard some say it's a prequel. But either way, it didn't affect my enjoyment of the film much. I kinda thought most of the mutants were kinda stupid, and the plot I think could have been something...more. Not saying the plot was terrible or anything, but I think it could have been better, and better characters could have helped that. Anyway, I didn't really like this X-Men movie, but just watch for yourself and decide for yourself. -Trent Foreman, Author of Nightmare"
5,Exciting and Fun Fantasy Adventure,"This was an enjoyable movie for fans of the genre; the pace, action and special effects were all well done and the story was filled with action. I had not read any reviews but watched it because of my general interest in the characters and the story of the beginnings of the X-Men.The movie was always on the move and held my attention from beginning to end. One discovers important information about each of the main characters and has a chance to observe the forces and circumstances that made them what they became later. As with all movies of this sort one must be able to accept the givens and I was able to do that so the movie became a vehicle for an afternoon's enjoyment. The video and audio quality is excellent although there were no special features on the disc which will present some viewers with a feeling something was left out.I recommend it for the fan of fantasy adventure movies."
1,Blu-ray didnot play at all,I got my product and the blu-ray did not play at all.It feels bad to spend money on a product and not get any value from it
5,great,"i like this movie a lot, best one yet!! i really hope that they continue the series, james mcavoy was great"
4,X-Men: First Class,"I purchased this movie in the Blu-ray + Digital Copy.I first saw the movie when I got the Combo package andit was great,the sharpness and sound seem to fit thiskind of movie very well."
4,The Little Blu-Man,"Good ole fashioned rockem sockem action movie,just ignore the hollywood politicalcorrectness messages and enjoy a release from reality!! The SerferDude!!"
1,Sad,"I found that the movie does not follow these characters very well. It is a pitty that the movies have moved so far away from the comic books. I was most annoyed with the theft of Angel, and making Angel a girl with fairy wings. In the end the way they play this is comes across that Magnito is right and Professor X is wrong. Didn't like it."
1,Rubbish,"What a load of brainless, ridiculous rubbish,very cliched,i couldn't wait for it to end.......that's 2 hours of my life wasted"
5,AWESOME MOVIE!!,"I love X-Men and this movie was epic! I loved it, plus the digital copy lets me take it and view it anywhere! It didnt take long to dowload it was actually really quick. The package arrived on time and in great condition. I definatley suggest anyone to by from this seller and this movie rocks!"
5,A great movie!!!,This is a great movie that tells the story of how the X-Men originated. I highly recommend this movie. A true digital copy makes this package a great buy!
2,Meh,"They really need to make villians like Apocalype and Mr Sinister in these and stop cutting corners with the whole budget saving ""guy in lounge suit or funny outfit"" thing. All these X-men movies had potential but fell so short. Some aspects to this one were good... Fassbender's performance for one. Most the rest not so... casting for just about every other role in this movie and the the inconsistency to the comics (Alex older than Scott, Beast gets Blue from Mystique's blood, yeah, seriously ???). The comics were fertile ground for a closer translation... lots of good material over the years."
3,An entertaining attempt...,"This was an entertaining attempt at making a great movie, but somewhere it fell by the wayside. The action was great, but it just didn't make this movie ""awesome"" per se. The characters were pretty cool, but I just didn't really like the young Xavier. I kept seeing the actor from Wanted, and couldn't wait for him to drop the f-bomb as Dr. X. Magneto's character was pretty interesting, but he still seemed less traumatized than someone would be after being tortured by Nazis. Overall, this movie is worth a buy, if only for some of the great action sequences and Kevin Bacon as a crazy mutant."
4,X-Men Opener,"Ties together the start of the series but I can't attest to the accuracy it has to the comic book series, even though I am old enough to have read it when it first came out."
3,Great movie... faulty Blu-ray,"This is probably the best X-Men film so far. Unfortunately, the disc can have some internet connectivity issues when viewed on the PS3.When I first purchased this film, it was very frustrating to watch. The picture would frequently freeze, while the audio continued, and then jump forward- almost like there was some kind of buffering problem. Turns out, the internet-enabled features of the disc were hampering playback. This was during the film itself, mind you, when there shouldn't have been any internet activity at all.The problem can be solved by deleting the ""X-Men: First Class"" folder- located in the BD Data folder in the video menu- and disabling your internet connection whilst watching the movie. Not a huge hassle, but it's pretty pathetic for a major release to have such a serious flaw."
1,"If you have a SAMSUNG BLU RAY PLAYER, DO NOT BUY THIS MOVIE",I called Samsung and confirmed this blu ray does not work with their players. I downloaded the latest firmware update ver 1022.3 released on sept 9 2011 and the blu ray won't play. I called samsung and they confirmed that is a known issue. Don't request a return and replacement if you see this. request a refund!
2,Are all movies going to do this,"I am getting a bit tired of every movie series making a movie that predates the others. I know Star Wars did it, but that is George Lucas. I would not buy this again."
5,First Class Movie!,"Marvel had another great year with 3 really good movies this year. This one explains the beginnings of X-men of course, watch it!"
1,"No go, bad disks x2, included digital copy is crap","I have received a second shipment of this BD and it does not play either,Roxio Cineplayer freezes completely on both copies of this Fox disk.None of my other 30 odd bluray disks have any problem playing, in additionI have two separate bd disk drives on my computer and both do the same lockup on this Fox XMen First Class (note that both drives are up to date onfirmware and they are different makes, one is Samsung and the other isLG).Not sure who is at fault but I'm certain it's not my computer or both drivesas they work for so many bluray. And it seems remote this could be Cineplayeras well. I'm guessing anyone trying this bd on a computer will find thesame results.Also I found the ""digital copy"" is worthless as it is lower resolution thanI would ever watch, it's not even 480p at 720x306, far below what I paidfor and wanted to see, after all it's supposed to be bluray (1920x1080)."
1,Fox has issue with Blu Ray's,"There are some serious issues with this Blu Ray, I returned it thinking it was defective and the new disc didn't work either. After a lot of searching come to find out it has issues working in certain players. Luckily I have a Sony and after reading a few other reviews I will try their fixes, but if FOX doesn't come out with a fix to this movie they will seriously lose money."
1,X-Math: 1/2 Reboot + 1/2 Prequel = 100% Suck,"Is it prequel? Is it reboot? Answer: It's a little too much of both, and not enough of neither.I guess it's a new genre: The Preboot.This film is bad, and not within the comic book context...it's just a piss-poor film. Trust me; when they throw a hot, half-dressed blonde on screen every few scenes, and I STILL don't care...the movie's in a bad way. Even some very good actors can't redeem this farce. This wasn't just phoned in...it was phoned in over tin cans tied to string.I'm honestly trying to find a way to review this without massive spoilers, but it's proving x-tremely (get it) difficult.For now, all I can say is this movie is inexcusable."
1,Don't buy.,"I watched this with a friend and afterwards was glad I didn't waste my money buying or even renting this movie. If you are looking for any kind of comic book continuity then skip this movie. There are so many things out of order in this movie I can't believe it was put into production. Alex Summers exists in the 60's as a young adult (impossible), and yet Scott doesn't.? I wasn't impressed with Kevin Bacon's portrayal of Sebastian Shaw or Sebastian's made up power to absorb explosions and energy to stay young.I won't bore you with all of the details of what I found wrong with this movie and why I wouldn't recommend watching it. If it was set apart from the comic books then it would be passable to watch. The special effects and action was good."
1,BluRay does not work,"Great movie, but the Blu Ray freezes up every five minutes or so. No update fixes this. Using Power DVD 10 on a Windows PC"
1,X-Men Blu Ray Not First Class,"X-Men: First Class (+Digital Copy) [Blu-ray] I wish I could say that this is a great movie. However, Fox dropped the ball in manufacturing this Blu-ray disc. Yes the picture and sound are great. If only the picture didn't freeze every 10 seconds or so as the sound keeps going only to have the video playing catchup. At first I thought I needed a PS3 Firmware update, but according to Sony, I was already up to date. I tried other blurays in my player with no problem, so I thought maybe I had a bad disc. After exchanging it for another at BestBuy (Thanks to the guy at the counter for hooking me up even though it was against policy) I brought the new disc home only to be frustrated again. I've looked online for answers and apparently I'm not the only one with this issues. Fox needs to release a statement as to what they're going to do to fix this situation. Very Disappointed!! If anyone else has these problems or has heard from Fox, please leave a comment."
1,Morality matters,"Hmmm... ""Comics aren't necessarily for children."" That's what the comic book industry is saying nowadays. They were for kids though when we were kids. The comic industry has decided though that they aren't that way anymore. Therefore, nowadays, the Man of Steel isn't a pure hero anymore...he's a super strong guy who fathers a child out of wedlock. Green Lantern has one night stands that we get to take glimpses of. Wolverine drops F-bombs. The Human Torch's girlfriend gets to tell the world about her fireproof lingerie. Iron man gets to have a menage-a-quatre. Hmmm...Comics might not be for kids anymore...but these movies are movies that, honestly speaking, kids should be protected from.What happens when you don't? What happens when you teach all of the children to abandon morality? London comes to mind.Ladies and gentlemen. Please grow up."
1,Failed to capture my interest.,"I felt very little emotion and connection to the characters and storyline. I feel this movie could have been written and performed so much better.Unlike the animated series on television years ago, which was done very well, the live-action movies have always seemed poorly done to me."
1,Save your money!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Save your money!!! I saw this in the theater and it was terrible. They messed up the story line not only from the comics, but also within the X-Men movies. If you are buying it for a kid that does not know any better, then by all means go ahead. It was a great comedy, but a horrid comic book movie. I laughed until I cried."
4,Really good movie,I feel that X-Men: First Class is a really good movie. I would say that its rating of PG-13 is appropriate.
4,Four stars on Michael Fassbender's performance alone!!,"I admit freely that I have always been more of a ""DC"" guy than a ""Marvel"" guy. However, I have enjoyed most of Marvel's films and the first two X films rank among the best (although Wolverine was miscast and portrayed too much as a whiner and cry baby...especially at the end of X2). This film was ""okay""...but Michael Fassbender seems BORN to play Magneto. His performance alone makes this film really worth watching. He carries an almost regal quality to the character. I'm glad that most of the film seemed more focused on him as opposed to Xavier. The second Xavier used the word ""groovy""...I lost interest in him."
5,"Excellant, as all X-Men",Have seen all the X-Men and I enjoyed this one as much as the others. Great job in keeping with the story line.
3,X-men First Class Blu-ray,i like this movie and i enjoy with this transfer and this price when i buy very cheap. and also i have slipcase in this edition. but i see this feature very low not much i am afraid this have a another edition later.
4,Not as much heart as it needed to be outstanding but more than it needed to make money,"Not bad. Not the original X-Men I knew and I think there were some poor choices made as far as who to include, who to invent, and who to leave out but, even with that, it's a pretty good superhero/action film. It doesn't have as much heart as it needed to be outstanding but has more than it needed to make money."
1,"Great movie, HORRIBLE BLU-RAY DISC","Be very careful when you buy this blu-ray, will not work in some Sony 3D blu-ray players, and some Samsung. There are some work-arounds online, but they don't always work and who wants to do that everytime. It's too bad Fox really dropped the ball on this blu-ray, it is a great movie."
1,Does not play with PowerDVD 10,"I'm sure it's a very nice movie but that doesn't mean much if you can't watch it, does it? Maybe a future update will fix the problem but the last one looks like it was in May so it's hard to be optimistic this will be resolved any time soon.I do have to say ""Not being sure if the movie will even bleeping play"" doesn't exactly inspire confidence in buying stuff. As is I know I'm certainly not getting any other recent 20th Century Fox titles until this is fixed."
1,Fox Blames LG Blu-ray Player,The Bluray disc that I bought did not work on my LG Blu-ray player. I called 20th Century Fox support number at the back of the box and they said it is fault of the LG Blu Ray player. They will not accept refunds. They were pretty rude and adamant that it was entirely the blu ray players fault because millions of people viewed this movie and are happy with it. And that they never heard anybody call and complain that it didn't work before.
1,Doesn't play,"The Blu-ray won't play on either of my players. I have a PS3 and a JVC BD player. I'm starting to hate blu-ray. I had to buy the DVD just to watch it. Good movie but save your money, buy the DVD."
2,Cheesy Mac,"Horrible story, bad acting, awkward directing, bad editing, cheesy dialogue, horrible special effects-this movie's got it all. It looks like a movie on a budget...and it acts like one. Prof and Magneto are the best actors here and do a lot of hand gesturing to exert their powers-what they call in the biz...acting. Everyone else is either horrible or forgettable. Bacon is...well...bacon."
1,horrible,"One of the worst most boring films I have ever seen. Casting Kevin Bacon (Kevin Bacon!) to play a Nazi is like casting Oliver Hardy to play Hannibal Lecter. It just doesn't cut it. The film flops along without energy, occasionally trying to blow a fuse but in some inappropriate, foolish fashion. Lights are seen directed down like beams upon character's faces, apparently to add ""drama"" to their expressions, otherwise flat and inexpressive. Oh, and the ""story."" How has it happened that fantasy Marvel characters are now immersed in scenes of the Holocaust, concentration camps, scenes of murder? Is this a film for grown-ups or children or, as it seems, absolutely no one at all?"
1,Booooooooooooooooooo-ring,"Typical, formulaic action movie. Even Jame McAvoy couldn't improve it. In fact, he looked totally bored, himself. I also like Rose Byrne, but she was underutilized."
3,rating,It's okay because there is no special features in this Blu ray version. So might be I'll buy another one.
5,X-MEN: FIRST CLASS,"Best of the series. Chronicling the origins of Xavier, Magneto, Mystique & Beast was brilliant.Very explosive from beginning to end. Eric (Magneto's) quest for revenge is haunting. If you'reAn X fan, no disappointment here."
4,Haven't watched it yet lol,"Got it when it was on sale because I heard it was good and needed something to fill in to get free shipping. It arrived on time and well packaged. As for the movie I can't say, one day I'll watch it."
4,Fassbender is perfect as Magneto,"There is a lot to like about this film, but Michael Fassbender is the standout. He is perfectly cast as Magneto in all respects. His screen persona is, quite literally, magnetic; he is so charismatic that you cannot take your eyes off of him while he is on camera. I don't just mean that he's hot--the dude can act (check the scene where he moves the satellite dish.) If I say more, I'll embarrass myself. Just watch this film; it's great fun!"
3,More Coach than First Class--But Still Not Bad!,"I didn't get to check this out when it was playing on the ""big screen,"" so I opted to rent and view by myself. What I found was a movie that wasn't half bad. ""X-Men; First Class"" tells the origins of the mutant gang a/k/a ""X-Men."" Two standout performances by the actors playing Xavier and Magneto kept the pace and action going. You finally get the backstory of how the two characters were once best friends, but fate played a cruel trick and placed them at opposite ends of the spectrum. Still, how could you not feel sorry for Magneto's character after you found out what had happened to him.The only real ""problem"" I had with the movie was the length. I found it a little too long, and because of several ""locations"" jumped back and forth a little bit too much for me. It's rated PG-13 and contains violence and language.All-in-all, not too bad."
4,No problems playing movie on PS3,"I read the 1-star reviews after purchasing film so I was worried I was going to have problems playing the movie, nonetheless I opened the movie and played it on my PS3 with absolutely zero issues! People having issues on their PS3 probably need to have the latest update installed.My only complaint is regarding the picture quality, it wasn't bad, but it wasn't great either. There seems to be a ""blur"" effect around the actors in certain scenes. In particular scenes with low lighting or somewhat quick movement. I would normally assume this to be a TV issue, however, my other Blu-Rays don't have this problem. For example, The Dark Knight, I don't have these similar issues with that movie and that movie has a lot of low lighting scenes. I'm not a film expert so I'm sure there is a reason/explanation for this.Purchase price: $9.99"
5,A superhero movie with more to offer than special effects,"This movie was amazing. Charles Xavier and Magneto were fantastically developed in this story. Many action films are just a bunch of special effects, but what makes a movie truly succeed is when the story has some heart, when you care about the characters that are growing and changing in the story. The script itself was also impressive. There were many lines that were expertly echoed in the movie such as ""mutant and proud"" and ""just taking orders.""I would have loved to see more going on with some of the minor characters like Havok, but hey, how much can you fit into one movie?"
1,Not as advertised,This item was not as advertised. Did not have DVD in it. It was just blue ray and digital copy.
4,Enjoyable but inconsistent with the series,I really enjoyed this movie.. it was fun to see the characters younger and how they became the X-Men. But if you are really into details you may be frustrated with some of the inconsistencies between this one and the previous movies that are supposed to take place later. But if you can get past those (and Kevin Bacon as the bad guy!) then you will see it is a pretty entertaining movie
4,Better the second time.... great price,I saw this in theaters and thought it was Okay. I was not planning to add to Blu ray collection. I was purchasing Super 8 and needed to order something else to get FREE shipping($25 purchase). X-men was $9.99. Shipment arrived quickly. X-men was MUCH BETTER the second time. PQ and AQ are very good. Some movies are just better on blu.. I buy 85% of my blu rays from Amazon. They always have the best prices.
3,McAvoy & Fassbender save this movie,"Most of the characters in this film are cardboard cutouts of little used comic characters. That said, this is a pretty good movie saved by the main actors who are good in it. I like the conceit of mutants role in history. The two also pull off how a disagreement of approach leads where it does.I played the in-movie extra and it worked well to explain some fun elements of the movie. The mutant detector isn't worth much. I wish there was a commentary. But, still a fine film."
5,"Smart, interesting, and entertaining tale","This is a smart, interesting, and entertaining take on the famous X-Men series. Great acting and a great plot make this movie a must see to ""Superhero"" fans. I won't get into the plot since it has been told on reviews here, but the special effects are outstanding and the story holds your interest throughout the movie. Highly recommended!"
1,Digital copy a flop,"I bought this for my brother to play in his dvd player. I figured he could play the digital version and if he ever gets blu ray in the future he'd be all set. But, it turns out he can't play it in his dvd player. Back it goes. What a waste. It made the gift a flop for the holidays. I felt bad."
1,"Good movie, bad copies","I've received this movie TWICE from Amazon. Both Blu-ray copies were not created correctly and skip. At first I thought maybe it was my PS3, but it plays other blu-ray's and games just fine. I even had the same problem on another PS3. Either they didn't created this correctly for use on PS3's, or there is a whole batch of these that are messed up..."
3,X-Men : First Class,To much special effects not enough story line. The writers could come up with a better story line. It seems they made this movie just for the money.
5,Can Never Go Wrong With Xmen,I am a great xmen fan and this is another great movie for the series. Even if you are not a fan you will like it.
4,Industrial music at it's best,"Take from All Music Guide: Though it's a bit less intentionally noisy than previous Neubaten material, Mensch is, in a way, the group's masterpiece. The inspired use of such ""traditional"" instruments as a grand piano alongside the band's characteristic blazing percussion make for a record similar more to their compositional influences like Stockhausen than their nearest contemporaries, Throbbing Gristle or Cabaret Voltaire. The record that showed Einstürzende Neubaten could rise above the concept of noise for its own sake to reach another level of noise-oriented post-punk music, Mensch is an excellent feat of industrial music. ~ John Bush, All Music Guide.The complete track listing on this video is as follows: Armenia, Sehnsucht, Letztes Biest, Abfackeln!, Zerstorte Zelle, Z.N.S., Halber Mensch, Die Zeichnungen des Patienten, Der Tod ist ein Dandy, Schaben."
3,nice shorts,"These are nice compression shorts, but not as padded as I thought they would be. The meaterial is very nice but seem more like just compression shorts rather than sliding shorts."
5,IT is totally what I wanted and as I imagined it would be,It has just about everything I look up. It is a great dictionaryI am very very happy with my purchase
5,Fits the K4SSWH!!!,"I recently purchased the K4SSWH at a Black Friday Sale. I was having a hard time finding the appropriate attachments. I searched through the reviews, and found that this would be the right one. However, one reviewer said hers did not fit, and also, by the picture, it doesn't look like it would fit. So I went ahead and took my chances and ordered it. I got it in yesterday, and it fits perfectly. The top part where it attaches to the machine does not look like the picture at all, it looks like it should. Trust me, if you bought the K4SSWH this is the whip for you!!!!"
1,"Careful, this may not fit the K45SSWH Mixer.","I purchased this wire whip from Senaca Falls Trading, Inc. based on K. Brooks's review which stated that the whip fit the K45SSWH mixer. The wire whip I received did not fit the K45SSWH at all."
4,The product is fine,"I don't know too much about this stuff because the cakemaker is my mother, but she tell me the product is fine and good working."
1,Did not fit the mixer that matched the model number.,"I wrote down the model number, confirmed the model number, and the invoice matched the model number, and the wire whip was too big for the mixer. BEWARE."
3,Not for kitchenaid 450 pro series,I bought this as a replacement and it does NOT reach the bottom of the bowl. I had to hold the bowl up to mix my egg whites to make macarons. Anybody that has a kitchenaid electric stand mixer 450 pro series do not buy this whisk. Haven't tried to make anything else but I'm sure I'd have to hold the bowl up to mix everything at the bottom.
5,"Great deal, great price",Found this to be exactly what I needed. The price was so much better than KitchenAid website!
1,Item not the right size,KitchenAid Wire WhipThis wire whip does not fit my kitchenaid. It is too big. I paid as much to have it shipped as I did for the item itself. I don't even think it would be worth returning since it will cost even more to ship. I am very disappointed. I was very careful to read which mixers it fit and checked my model number. Be careful when you buy this.
5,Great attachment,"I use this for making butter, waffles, and anything else you would use a whisk for. It fits my 4 1/2 qt. K4SSWH, but leaves a small amount of space so it does not scratch the bowl. This can be a problem when making small batches.Very useful attachment. Just as useful as the flat beater or the dough hook!"
5,for myself,"I had to replace the one that came with my kitchen aid, i misplaced the other one and cant find it anywhere"
2,Doesn't fit,"I bought this wire whip attachment for my mother. The description read that it would fit the model mixer that she had, but unfortunately it was too long and wouldn't go into the bowl. I think some reasearch might need to be done on it to see exactly what model numbers it will fit. Would up getting a better one at Bed Bath & Beyond.I am giving this two stars because I did receive a speedy refund from the seller."
3,Notice the SIZE!,"I must've been half asleep when I ordered this, it is TINY! I suppose you ""could"" bake a 2 bite-size loaf of bread, one at a time, but I don't think anybody has that kind of time. It is a cute little tin though, would be good for a little kid's play kitchen set, or for keeping anything tiny in. I'm thinking of a water/food dish for my parakeet!"
5,Most Excellent!,WILL SOMEONE PLEASE ISSUE STRATEGIC AIR COMMAND ON DVD? This movie sure has excellent shots of the B36 and B47 in flight. A great sample of 1950's America!
3,Strategic Air Command,This movie should be closed cationed The lack of complete full screen viewing detracts from a comfortable appreciation of the overall context of the movie.
4,good movie,"This is another movie I wasn't sure I would be able to find. Really enjoyed the flying parts of the B-36, and the B-47. really good movie for its time."
4,The Way We Were,"Almost fifty years after this movie's release date (1955), I am still haunted by the magnificent aerial photography. This movie must be seen for that reason alone! As a time-capsule, the movie also deals with a period when the Air Force was moving to jet bombers and gearing up to fight the cold war.It is now history. We ""won"" the cold war, most actors in this film are no longer with us and the largest aircraft ever in active service with the Air Force---the B-36, exists only on film.Forget the story line, forget the Air Force propaganda pitch from the fifties and just relax and enjoy a spectacular scenic view of what others did to help ""protect and defend"" during a earlier era.Today, those who continue to protect us by flying stealth technology bombers stand on the shoulders of those who flew the B-36's and B-47's depicted in this movie.We are all indebted...enjoy the movie!"
3,1950s Air Force promo,"The actors and plot of ""Strategic Air Command"" take a back seat to the movie's real star - the Air Force of the mid-50s in all of its bare-metal-finished glory. This was a period of transition, when the last of the piston-driven aircraft and the early jets briefly coexisted at the beginning of the Jet Age, much the same way as steam power and diesel power shared America's rails at the same time. If you are a military history buff like me and can tolerate the bombastic score and impossibly clean dialogue typical of 1950s-vintage movies, this is worth watching."
4,Well-done propaganda film,"Jimmy Stewart goes from being disappointed to be in SAC (he's called up from the reserves) to being disappointed he has to leave. It's a product of it's time, at a difficult point in the Cold War, and is a blatant plug of SAC's deterrent mission. Some great flying footage of both the big B-36 and the medium-range B-47, the precursor to the B-52."
4,Strategic Air Command,"A Great Pride in our Nation's Armament, Pride and Protection. Being Ex Navy and understanding the importance of the security against any aggression from outside adversaries."
4,Strategic Air Command -,Would it kill them to put this in DVD format? One of Jimmy Stewart's best films in that it mirrors is off-screen life as an Air Force officer. It would be a fitting tibute to him to have this on DVD where all can enjoy!
4,"Definate eye candy, but...","it just was not long enough! I enjoyed the videos for great songs like ""Kiss"" and ""Psycho Magnet"" but I wish there were more promotional videos, and definately more live footage. Backstage, the boys seem very, very funny, and they are rightly famed for being attractive, but on the whole, it was only 20 minutes long, and it was not long enough for my taste. But then again, I could watch/ listen to this band all day cuz I'm a big fan-girl at heart ;)"
3,DSGB-- 3.5 stars,I want everyone to get out there and pick up this album and DSGB's new album Til Death Do Us Part. Somebody has to get the word out about these guys and thats what Im trying to do. This is a short album but it has a couple of really hard songs. The new album is better than this one but it has songs that you cant miss.
1,I Am DSGB!,"Troy why did you put your name on this. This cd has one good song on it and that is about the long and short of it. I am not going to waste a bunch of time talking about a cd that is not worthy of being pressed, by the way the group was better with Conrad the Colonel (Ehhhh Hehhh! I AM DSGB!)"
4,Sailor is a captivating music experience.,"I think that just about everyone of age 15-33 has seen Steve Miller Band live. With usually about two tours a year, SMB is not a tough act to catch. Everyone's heard Gangster of Love, Abracadabra, and Jungle Love. What makes Sailor so different is that it is a departure from traditional SMB style. The music on this album is much less pop-esque, and features more hard-edge guitar riffs and eloquent song-writing. My Friend is a rock anthem that is on my top-five best song of all time lists. (A shout out to all the U of I Betas for whom this song has special meaning.) Living in the USA is another memorable tune, and the disc also features the favorite Gangster of Love. The limited airplay and circulation of this disc make it a tough one to come across, but a worthwhile one to own. I'd highly reccomend adding this disc to your classic rock collection."
4,A blend of Psychedelic & Pop,"Still lots of weird stuff on Steve Miller's 2nd album, though mixed well with structures that produced a number of tunes that could have filled the airwaves. In fact, ""Living In The U.S.A."" remains the earliest SMB tune to CONSISTENTLY turn up on the radio-- even after 31 years! Other highlights for me were ""My Friend"", ""Quicksilver Girl"", ""Lucky Man"", ""Gangster Of Love"", ""You're So Fine"" and ""Overdrive"". Incidentally, Miller seems to have followed in the footsteps of Cab Calloway, Jimmy Castor and the like by doing ""sequel"" songs over the years. References to ""Gangster Of Love"" turn up on later albums (most memorably in the lyrics of ""The Joker"") although the song itself actually got a much BETTER version done on the 1983 ""LIVE!"" album."
5,excellent remasteringit is,"it""s a pleasure to hear this great music again in a crystal clear version."
4,"Great, but flaw in Living in the USA?","At 1:39 it sounds like a couple of seconds of mangled master tape or something.But I quibble. A first-rate sound of the times from his earlier, blues-inflected, pre-party-down era. (Saw him in concert last night, and he's still got it.)"
3,"Mini LP sleeve is nice but, this is Not Remastered!","Limited Edition Japanese pressing of this album comes housed in a miniature LP sleeve but, it's NOT REMASTERED! This has the same sonic quality as the (much lower cost) domestic release that has been available for ages."
4,'Sailor' is back,The 'Sailor' album by the Steve Miller Band was one of my favorites from the 70's. I'm glad that it is once again available.
2,Better than first album,"There's a reason you don't know much about his earlier career. If you want to listen to a sucky indulgent late 60's California band, get QuickSilver Messenger Service first album. At least Sailor had a minor hit (Living in the USA). I would be more lenient if this was the first album. Seeds of potential can be heard on some of the tracks, but he's got a long way to go. He must have been connected, I would not have let him record another album after the first. But, good thing they did because he was much better in the 70's."
4,Informative but dryish study,"Richardson leads the reader into some unfamiliar corners of one of history's best-mapped locales, that of Renaissance Italy. We are taken into the printer's workshop, we stand behind the bookseller's counter, we are permitted into literate homes to see what books there are, and where, and how they are read. The examination of the mechanics and statistics of the book trade in its infancy is informative but rather dry. More engaging is the tail-end of the book where we are introduced first to writers, then readers: it is Richardson's examination of how printed books entered and enriched their lives which lifts his book, and which lingers in the reader's mind."
5,home-town memories,"all i know is i grew up in a scene where giant's chair was already cherished and established in their (my) hometown of green bay, wisconsin. upon the band relocating to kansas city and myself off to school, i have lost track of the band and any new acheivements. ""red and clear,"" however, still satisfies my appetite for giant's chair even after owning it what is going on almost six years. their shows a legend, this album is as close as one can get to the days when they played kutzka's hall in green bay. powerful, infectious, antagonistic; ""red and clear"" will not disappoint. also check out their split 7"" with boy's life."
4,Good CD,"This is a good CD and I like it a lot. Some of the songs are bachata mixed with hip-hop or R&B. I like the spanglish. Only gripe is WHY was ""Tengo Amor"" recorded with Rakim y Ken-y (The remix)??? That remix is horrible. Toby has a nice sexy voice and alternating with Ken-Y's voice messes it all up. Sorry, Ken-Y should not try to sing. Overall, this was a good purchase."
2,eh !,"Well i'm not sure whether to give it a 2 or 3 out of five ! It's not reality TV. They're faking every single scene. It's all acting and Paris Hilton gets on my nerves. She's so not funny, doesn't know how to act. I like Nicole more, it is very clear that she has more character and she's funnier. If you're dead bored and you want to watch gorgeous girls wearing designer clothing and handbags, then watch this one. It kinda passes time for ya if you have a lot with nothing to do."
5,The Simple Life: Season Five - Goes to Camp.,"Love these two together, so I had to get this to add to the rest of them. It's a bit different than the others, but it's still funny."
4,The End Of The Simple Life,"The final season of The Simple Life was not as good as the others, but it was still funny. You can really tell how fake this season was. It features all of the episodes, but it does not contain the original extended premiere that only aired once. It contains the shortened syndicated version. It also does not contain an episode guide insert like all of the previous seasons and does not contain any special features like the last 3 seasons. Pretty good show, but a bad DVD release."
1,"Very, very disappointed in this product","I would not recommend this product if you are looking for a steam cleaner that is 'actually' going to do the work for you. I had such high expectations when I ordered this machine. I couldn't wait for it to get here and when it did ""I"" did most of the scrubbing while the steam did nothing but make what I was trying to clean 'hot'. I spent more time scrubbing on my own then the machine actually did. This was a very diappointing product.I had to give the product 1 star because I couldn't post this review without a star. But if it was up to me I wouldn't give it any stars.Sincerely,Cathy"
1,don't buy it-no customer service,"I wrote a 5 stars review last year but I have to change it to one star. The unit broke down one month after purchase and it took the company 6 weeks to repair it. Then a few months ago it broke down again but this time I was not even able to reach their customer service- I left dozens of messages on their answering machine, wrote several emails- no response. I am shopping for a new steam cleaner but it won't be this brand for sure."
5,Love it!,"This product really works! I have lots of tilework in my bathrooms where mold and mildew have been a problem; often returning within a day or two. I've used every cleaner on the market and nothing worked. It has been over a week and a half now and the tiles are still sparkling clean. Also, it's really a ""green"" machine because all you use is water. It's worth it's weight in gold!"
2,Happy Customer,"We ordered the steamer on May 31, and received it on June 6.We purchased this one because it has a one-quart capacity for water, and yes, it will put out steam for a half hour.We're removing wallpaper from our bathroom walls - easilyThis steamer is easy to use! There are more attachments for it than we may ever need, but they're here. The cord is long, and the hose and wand make it possible to use it on walls without holding one's arms above one's head!I can't wait to use it on our radiators. We have steam heat, and the old radiators are impossible to clean using conventional methods. I'm sure it's gonna do just fine."
3,Not too adventurous but a good debut nonetheless,"As far as debut albums go these days, Furslide's ""Adventure"" shows a lot of promise, even if it isn`t exceptional. The band isn`t really indie rock, but isn`t too mainstream either, so it mixes a bit of both to create a pleasant record that`s worth talking about. It is, pherhaps, a bit derivative: at parts it comes close to Garbage or Fiona Apple territory, while in other segments I can see echoes of Ani di Franco, the Breeders or even Sheryl Crow (although better). Jennifer Turner`s voice can get raw (""Bring You Down"")or more delicate (""Faith"") and it truly shines in ""Love Song"", probably the best moment in the album.Although it isn`t a superb record and has actually some filler songs, ""Adventure"" is an interesting effort that deserves some time in one`s CD-Player. Recommended."
4,Surprising,"I bought this on impulse after having the beautiful single, Love Song, stuck in my head for days (I didn't mind, though I'm sure it would eventually have become a problem...). It quickly became one of my favourite albums. I wish this band was more widely recognised, they truly deserve it."
5,A masterpiece of NYC/London Rock. Jen Turner Rules!!!,These kids from Brooklyn are living their British Music Fantasy. To them it was like making Sgt. Pepper. I had a chance to see them in NYC a number of times and was glad to hear that the raw Rock sound was intact after Nellee Hooper did his thang. It's a well balanced and mature album from Natalie Murchant's Guitar Goddess Jennifer Turner along with one of the best rhythm sections alive!!!
4,Cat Fancy!,"You don't have to be a cat-fancier to appreciate these stories of love and loss. Each feline in these engrossing short stories serves a unique purpose. Whether acting as catalyst to an impending break-up, or as bait for an attempted kidnapping, the cats in these stories reflect and compliment their humans in a way that sheds light on all of our relationships, both feline and human. Using ""the cat"" as metaphor could easily become a hackneyed literary device, but in de Gramont's clever hands, OF CATS AND MEN manages to escape that particular pitfall. The stories are intriguing, the characters and relationships are multi-dimensional, and the dialog is realistic. This book is an insightful and creative look at modern romantic relationships."
5,"Author, ""The Feline Mystique""","I grabbed this when I saw it because I've got a nonfiction book coming out next spring (2002) on the connection between women and cats, saw this as a reward for getting the ms. done, and I'm so happy I did. Beautiful, lucid writing about real relationships -- primarily romantic human ones, as opposed to human-feline -- and a joy to read. The one on the schizoaffective brother-in-law (""The Closest Place"") broke my heart with its truth (yeah, I've got a book on growing up with mentally ill siblings out, too). Hope she does a novel next. - Clea Simon, author of ""Mad House"" (Penguin), ""Fatherless Women"" (Wiley), and the upcoming ""Feline Mystique"" (St. Martin's)."
4,It smelled wonderful! I tried it and it ...,"It smelled wonderful! I tried it and it made my skin sooo soft and moisturized. I have dry skin, but after using the product for a week or two, my dry skin went away! It smells the best, because I love grapes, and it works wonders! I also used it on my cousin and she loved it! She's three and she had so much fun smelling the bubbles and playing with them."
5,My kids loved this! The grape scent and ...,"My kids loved this! The grape scent and purple color are what they really liked about it. I liked that it contains natural ingredients that won't cause urinary tract infections and aren't harsh to their skin. Also it contained no DEA, which is hard not to find in these kinds of products. Also liked that it made lots of bubbles that really last."
4,"My children liked it, but I thought it ...","My children liked it, but I thought it was a pain. The only real problem was that it's a very thick gel. To use it for bubble bath, you first have to put some on your hands then rub them together. Otherwise, it just stays like a ball of jelly on the bottom the tub. It's also difficult for smaller children to wash with because the chunk of gel falls off into the water. I don't think I'd buy it. There are many other products that work much better for children."
2,Life of St. Francis of Assisi,"Book was printed backward--ie--from BACK to FRONT!!I realize this is an OLD book, but the printershould have TOLD you it was printed backwards!"
3,Suit Yourself on This,"But don't expect to learn much from Jennifer Bloomer about either Joyce or Piranesi. This is postmodern scholarship to the nth degree. Me, I prefer the originals. You've been warned!"
5,like a dreamy fall,Fantastic! Extraordinary. A truly beautiful book. Transformed the way I look at things. Can't praise it highly enough. Jennifer Bloomer is now the only academic to whom I have wanted to write gushy fan letters.
4,Great set of glasses!,"I got these glasses for my apartment. I have had them for many months now and they are amazing! I wash them by hand, only because I do not have a dishwasher. I do clean them every once in awhile in my mother's dishwasher when I go home for the holidays, and they do not get any water spots on them!The picture on here represents the actual product very well!Pros:Great starter setGood number of eachTall glasses are good for everyday drinks and the short are good for ""on the rocks"" drinks!Steady bases - nice and thick so they don't tip easily for klutzes like me!Classic design- will be in style for years to come!Cons:Not stackable - I tried once, just to carry them to the sink. When I tried to pull the top glass out, the bottom glass shattered. The top glass was fine though! (That was one of the tall glasses. I have yet to try stacking the short, but I do not plan on trying just to see if it breaks!)"
5,Wow!,"This is an amazing set of songs from Hed Kandi. This is their first DISCO KANDI series and it's just awesome. No filler whatsoever! The songs are discofied and have hints of latin thrown in here and there. Lots of great anthems here that will get you ready for your Saturday night or whatever! Highlights include a club mix of Soulsearchers ""Can't Get Enough"", Stars on 54's ""If You Could Read My Mind"", Eddie Amador ""Rise"", Sun Kids feat Chance ""Rescue Me"", and The Lab Rats present The Experiment feat Lisa Millett ""Music Is My Way Of Life"". Overall a great cd worth seeking out for! It is deleted and I searched hard and payed a lot, but it was worth it!"
1,Not a substitute for the Peaches&Creme face moisturizer,Beware - if you are trying this product in place of the Kiss My Face Peaches & Creme AHA 8% Face/Neck Moisturizer - it is not the same - not even close! It doesn't even smell the same or have the same ingredients or feel the same. It appears that the face and neck moisturizer may have been discontinued - it is no longer listed on the Kiss My Face website. This product is not a good substitute for the face and neck moisturizer.
3,"So, so","I ordered the product based on the positive reviews on the web. I'm not impressed, but I know that when it comes to beauty items, everyone's skin is different. I absolutely love the smell, it is refreshing and delicious. I think it did give me better looking skin overall, but it is so thick on my face that I can hardly stand it because it feels oily after a couple of hours. It does leave the skin very soft, but it causes small breakouts, for me at least. My skin type is combination and I wouldn't recommend this for daily use. I don't feel much moisturizing action going on either, to be honest, it is definitely not suited for harsh winter days since it doesn't protect your face at all. I'll keep using it as an on and off night time moisturizer since it has the AHA, but I will not order it in the future, it is just not suited for me. I have given it 2 weeks before writing the review since beauty items need time to provide results, but it hasn't worked out for me."
4,It is a good moisturizer,"This product is very good. It keeps my face moisturized and soft all day. The texture is a little heavy, that why I was concerned, because my type's skin is oily, but after one month and a half of using it, I am very happy with the results so far. The only thing that I don't like is the smell is too strong, maybe they can lower the dose of the scent of peaches and It will be much better."
1,Not for sensitive face and necks,"I bought this hoping I could use it in place of my favorite face and neck cream. Within minutes my sensitive face was burning. I am frustrated they discontinued my favorite, peaches and cream for face and necks."
3,Lots of excerpts!,"That's what you are going to get! It's an excellent CD if you want to get into classical music. Lots of the high hitters you hear too much of! But for someone who knows about classical music who just wanted this CD for the Tchaikovsky Coronation March, don't get it. Waste of [money] unless you have a reason to buy it. The music playing and recording is average. Nothing special but not bad."
4,Great way to realise that maths is far more than arithmetic,"I like the easy, conversational style of the book, which seems accessible without being dumbed-down.I think it is a great way to show children that maths can be fun, interesting and useful, not just loads of dry facts and drill.I would recommend it to anyone of any age - even adults kick-starting their math career again - it provides a wonderful place to build from. This is not a workbook, or a drill book, it is an inspiring book."
3,Great Content BUT,"This book contains a number of engaging math and logic problems, something that we do a lot of. Unfortunately, the print is small, the pages are quite crowded and answers are often extremely hard to find, all of which really limits the book's usefulness both in our math program and as a ""just for fun"" book."
4,"Great book, bad reading level rating","The book is great but it should be rated for 12+ instead of 9-12. The book goes into abstract concepts very hard to understand for a 10 year old. I bought it for my daughter which is the best of her class in math and she was very frustrated with the book. To really appreciate the book you need a very good grasping and confidence with the basic operations, fractions, powers and geometry, that means well beyond the years where your kid is learning those topics."
1,Hope you already know your Washington History...,"I purchased this book as a way to supplement the Washington History lessons I was preparing, but have found the book to be almost useless.This book is filled with errors and inaccurate information. The first activity in the book lists Ohio as one of the states that borders Washington, there are many errors similar to this throughout the book. At least a third of the lessons I reviewed had one or more errors.I have found that it is easier to write my own activity pages than to spend time rewriting the ones from the book. I am also trying to get in contact with the publisher to let them know my concerns."
5,pastry cutter,I am so very pleased with my new pastry cutter. I have had a smaller version of one that is 50 years old. It just didn't do the job. Now I have one that makes my pastry look professional.
1,over a month for delivery and still not here,This was ordered before Christmas and it is now January 22 and I still haven't received it.
5,Lived in Brooklyn and loved this book,My sister in law gave this book to all the attendees at her wedding in Manhattan. I was living in Brooklyn at the time and found the book to be fantastic. I have always pulled it out when I am going someplace new or when I have visitors. I have several guidebooks for NYC and this is the most used.
2,Rehashed Guidebooks & Knowledge,"With 3-4 excellent guidebooks already covering these areas, this one is really a rehash of those books. In addition, many of the areas covered have incorrect landowner and access information, as well as poor instructions on how to ride the loops for maximum fun. Look to Zilly's books and local group rides for the best trail guides."
5,Must have!,"When you order a copy of Ortberg's book, be sure to get this participant's guide along with it. This workbook is great for Bible studies of all shapes and sizes. It has discussion questions, scripture passages, large group and small group interaction, as well as a personal 'digging deeper' component in each section. Our small group (4 couples) just finished the book and study guide--LOVED it and two of us feel we are being called out of our boats!We had purchased the video too, but we were not convinced the video really added anything for us. We would recommend that you not spend the extra money on it unless there are members in your group that may not do the reading or you have lengthy time spans between the times you meet."
4,study group,"I bought it for a study group, very good study guide I also got the book great as it was my first bible study, change your life as you get out of the boat, It is hard for me as I am not good at change but slowly am changing for the better"
3,Somewhat cliche and cheesy.,"Although this lesson had a lot of good points, our Bible study group found ourselves skipping a lot of questions because they were very repetitive. They are also a bit too guiding... many of the questions seem like there is always a ""duh"" answer, rather than encouraging real thought. That said... the video is good, and John Ortberg is engaging."
3,"I goofed , be careful",This is a work book not the book don't make the mistake I did and order the wrong item :)
