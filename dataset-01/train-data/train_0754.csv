3,Very Sad,"Although this film really highlights the struggles of gay couples and Sharon Gless was terrific, it is very sad so make sure you have a full box of tissues ready."
4,A moving movie,"A great little movie! It is probably more true than any of us want to believe. Sharon Gless plays a good role, as usual. Certainly worth watching."
4,Excellent reference for various styles of music.,"This book is really a great ressource for musicians who want to improve their style in pop ballad, gospel, new age music, ... I would advise it to anyone who already has some basic notion of how to 'fake' a song = interpret a song based only on a lead sheet (melody + chords), and who wants to go further. The author gives lots of examples, breaking them down in basic components, and analysing them. He gives hundreds of patterns of accompaniment (arpeggios, chord voicings, rhythmic patterns).A warning: the title 'The Pop Piano Book - A complete method for playing piano and keyboards in contemporary styles', is misleading. This book is definitely NOT intented for beginners. Rather for people who already have a few years of experience on the piano (correct fingering, and independance of hands), and preferably have some notion of note reading (although the purpose of the book is of course to be able to play music without having to read notes)."
1,Good intentions but not user-friendly,"Love the content, hate the book! Inaccessible due to format, a poorly designed book with good intentions. Yes, this is a sorely needed volume, but needs better organization, design, layout and print quality! Many pages in my copy have blurred text. You can't lay the book open because of the poor binding. This book should be re-structured as a series of workbooks in the style of the excellent Jazz Piano The Complete Method (Examinations Department of The Associated Board of the Royal Schools of Music). A publication with graded examples for pop, folk and rock piano enthusiasts is sorely needed! How about it, music publishers?"
5,Great resource for new students.,"Randall Hassell is a true legend in the St. Louis Area. I had high expectations for this book and was not disappointed. As a new Karate student, I was baffled with all the new terms. This book has addressed my quest for information and I feel much more informed. A must for a new student."
4,Describes the Basics Clearly,"This book not only covers what karate's history and traditions are, but how the basics are performed, and how they should be performed. The book also describes JKA shotokan requirements for each level up to shodan black belt. This book is a must for every traditonal japanese karate-do practioner."
5,"Terrific, varied jazz with personality!","If you're looking for a disk that's a pleasure to listen to from beginning to end, you're in the right place. A vibrant and shimmering feminine voice singing an enticing collection of jazz favorites, accompanied by fine musicianship in uplifting and mezmerizing arrangements. Unlike the monotony of some jazz CDs I've heard, the selection of songs here is varied in style, tempo, mood and even language, keeping the listener engaged and highlighting the versatility of the artist. This is music you can feel; it carries you away. My idea of just what a jazz CD ought to be! I look forward to her next CD."
3,Ostrilicious!,"This Ostrich is VERY spectacular. And Expensive! He's SO easy to dance with, and he wont POKE YOUR EYES OUT!"
2,Tedium,"Notwithstanding the fact that the acing in the movie is actually quite good, the screenplay is so tedious I actually fell asleep in the middle of the afternoon while watching it. A good cure for insomnia!"
2,DON'T DO THE TWIST,"Twister is a bad movie with a horrible horrible plot that adds up to nothing. It's about a couple of tornado chasers that fall in love. Ever so dumb plot. The only thing that makes me give this movie two whole stars is the special effects (although the movie deserves only one). Special effects are great in this movie. If your a no plot special effects freak (buff), then you would love this horrible movie Twister. Rated PG-13: for language, and scenes of tornado damage"
5,Excellent Condition,"The DVD was in excellent condition as stated. My kids watched and there were no problems. Besides, the price was good. Thank you."
3,chipmunks,"The movie was o.k., the quality of the picture was horrible. May have enjoyed the movie more if I could actually see the entire movie clearly."
3,Alvin & the Chipmunks: Chipwrecked,"The Alvin and the Chipmunks: Chipwrecked was an ok movie. It is interesting for children. My 18 month old son enjoyed the songs but the plot was a little too advanced for him to follow. It definitely has adult oriented themes, but is still ok for younger viewers. I did enjot=y the first two movies more than this one."
4,My 4 year old loves it,My son really enjoys Alvin and the Chipmunks. The movie is child friendly and neat. The other two are not available yet on Amazon which is unfortunate for now. Great movie.
1,Rip off,"This is a rip off of the movie Castaway with Tom Hanks. We all remember that Fed-Ex infomercial in which Tom Hanks gets stranded on an island and paints a face on a volleyball named Wilson. Well, in this Chipmunk movie, Alvin and the gang wash up on an island and find a lady that works for U.P.S. and has basketballs, golf balls, etc. with faces painted on them. So, there is nothing original in this flick."
3,For my 10 yr old,There are many movies i can watch with my daughter and enjoy but this is not one of them. It is way too silly for me. My daughter liked it but i know it was not one of her favorites.
5,alvin,loved this movie and watched it several times already with my grandaughters. they loved it to. Great Movie Ok done now
5,Chipmunks,"Okay these movies are the greatest...I have loved the chipmunks ever since they appeared eons ago..I am 71 but still have good memories of these guys..Everyone go out and buy this movie, its great."
3,fine for the family,Well not for adults looking for a deep thought out plotmy seven year old thought that it was a great movie and that is all that matters.
1,Where is the 3d?,I spent alot of money to get a 3d tv then they do crap like this and not releasing it in 3d. Come on
3,Alvin And The Chipmunks: Chipwrecked,My two and a half year old grandaughter enjoyed watching it with me. Great fun for little ones!Good family movie that was also funny. Nice to see a movie that you don't have to worry about the bad words or violence!
3,Alvin & the Chipmunks: Chipwrecked,"I think that the chipmunks are adorable and always enjoy their movies. Obviously, it's not the best movie ever, but kids and adults can enjoy it. I like watching movies like this when I just want to relax and I want a cute, fun movie. Plus, this movie is only 99 cents right now and you really can't beat that!"
2,Alvin and the Chipmunks Chipwrecked,"Movie was a cute movie but DVD had a big chunk out of it and only half of the movie would play. Since I bought it for a birthday gift for my baby girl she was very upset when she could not watch all her movie,"
5,Movie,Was very pleased with this movie. I liked how fast it was shipped. Would be happy to buy again from you.
4,Ok,This movies is ok. The woman on the island is a little too sinister for mor taste but whatever. It works
3,Alvin and the chipmunks,It was ok. The dancing scene was a bit risqu√© for being a rated g movie though. I'd give it 3 stars
1,DVD Freezes after beginning credits - Would like a replacement,"The DVD gets as far as the beginning credits and freezes. I made sure it was not my dvd players in the house because all are farely new, so that was not the problem. The dvd would just freeze. I had to hide it because my daughter would cry when the dvd freeze. She has a mental disability and doesnt understand when I tell her that the dvd is not working right. It would be nice to have this purchase replaced with a new dvd due to my special circumstances."
5,chipwrecked,"if you have ever been on a carnival cruise, it will totally take you back. Loved it, another great kids animated movie"
2,Bland,"This wasn't one of the better kids movies I've had to sit through with the little ones. Too many strange pop culture reference that tried to pass off as being ""cute,"" probably for the sake of the adults. As you can probably tell, I didn't find them so cute. If you want to introduce your kids to Alvin et al, screen the original 80s cartoon show. Pass this one up."
1,its sucks,how dose this movie have 4 stars the 2 movie was bad but as sucky as the 3rd they should not have made a sencond one
3,Good Kids Movie,I bought this for my grand daughter and she liked it! Alvin and the Chipmunks are very such cute characters.
3,"Entertaining as children's movies go, cute and action packed.","My four year old actually saw this at his cousins' house and then continuously requested to see it at home. So I bought it on Amazon and it is pretty cute. Full of witty humor to keep parents from slipping into ""kiddie tv"" comas. It's sweet and innocent and shouldn't offend most conservative families, though it does have a gambling scene on a cruise and a girl dance-off scene that are both a little odd, but in my estimation harmless enough. Overall, it was funny, entertaining and presented a good message."
5,Fun movie,"As always, Alvin & the Chipmunks didn't disappoint my kids. They enjoyed the movie, and I admit, so did I. I like the music. We later downloaded the music soundtrack (with some songs left out of the kids playlist).Fun movie."
5,five star chimp,This is a very good movie. My son will watch it over and over. He stay quite I can do my house. Chores While he is watching and when I finish is sit and watch with him. We have movie night and this movie is the first one he picks
4,LOVED it!,"I took my daughter, husband and a few kids we were babysitting to this show.We laughed the entire way through. I dont know who enjoyed it more, me or the kids. The 4 yr old was glued to thescreen. The music was entertaining and the story line wasn't predictable. We had a great time and the kidscant wait until it comes out on DVD. I love the ending (SPOILER ALERT) when a bad guy turns good. Great lessonand lots of laughs and fun."
5,Chipmunks!,Bought this for my daughter to complete her collection. She says it is her favorite so far and watches it almost every day since we bought it!
5,Great Phone,I had purchase a 2.4 GHz previous and it was nothing but trouble. A friend of mine purchased this phone and really liked it so I purchased it with an extra handset. We love it. I take it outside with me and never have to run for the phone. The reception is very clear. Best phone I have ever owned.
5,Great Phone,"I researched phones before I bought this one. We've had it for about 8 months and love it! My favorite feature, though silly, is that I can change the ringer. When I get a new favorite song, I change the ringer :o) We had DSL and the phone worked perfectly with it. We switched to cable modem as personal preference, but I can tell you that we had absolutely NO problem when we had DSL. I'm so glad I did all the research before deciding on this phone!"
3,Could have been better,"Was a bit disappointed in the story and the artwork. It was ok, but there's better out there."
3,Warning! discloses ending,"let down by unrealistic behaviour...I enjoyed ""the selfless sister"" a great deal, but must complain about the ending! As a mother myself, I can never imagine that the outrageousness of Edgerton lying about Mariannes wherabouts would be so little examined! Basically, he killed her because at any point that day the next or the next, he could have saved her life by telling someone where she was.Also, when a life was involved, surely everyone would have been involved in a search party, and as a mother! I would have been searching the attic myself not relying upon the servants to do it! I can't believe that they would just accept as easily as that, when everyone would have been anxious and frantic and surely checking over twice what they had checked before!That, to me, is the worst and most letting down feature of the book. I hated that it ended like that.It was also not made much of, when it came to light."
1,Colossal Disappointment,"I'm a huge scrapbooker, and - much to my husband's dismay - I seem to buy anything and everything that contains the word ""Scrapbook."" But, I've got to tell you, Creating Keepsakes really let me down.Turns out that most of the truly good templates depicted on the box reside in something called the ""Idea Vault."" That is not a happy place because it amounts to a series of PDF thumbnails that are completely uneditable and completely unusable in the software. And the templates that are available are pretty crummy.I'm sorry, but it's just not fair to include designs on the box - much less boast of the idea vault as a ""feature"" (gimme a break) - when they're just not available to people who buy the software. I can't recommend Creating Keepsakes. But I do own Scrapbook Factory Deluxe 2.0 (of course ... it has the word ""Scrapbook"" in it :-) and that I can heartily endorse."
1,Don't Waste Your Time!,"I am a longtime scrapbooker and ordered this right away when it came out. Well I got it today and guess what - it's just Print Shop all over again. How many times does Broderbund want me to buy the same program under a different name. If you have Print Shop or Printmaster or any other Broderbund product, don't waste your money."
2,Fun but...,"I have to say I'm disappointed. The ""new"" Creating Keepsakes (CK) fonts advertised are not really new at all - they're from CK's original font collections, which I already own. The CK art, too, is from their CD packages. Like another reviewer stated, the whole workspace and basic set-up really isn't any different than other Broderbund programs, either. I just invested in the new Printmaster version - this program isn't very different at all. The main advantage I see is its ability to create layouts/projects in 12x12, except I don't have a printer that can do that.It's a good program if you don't already own anything by CK or any of Broderbund's creativity software, but I give the program 2 stars because of its lack of originality and what I consider to be deceptive advertising."
1,Don't buy this if you already own Printmaster.,"Printmaster Ver. 15, which I use often, offers the same graphics and options that this software does, plus much more. I expected original art and template ideas and was very disappointed. The page layout templates are quite unimaginative and would be easy to create from most very basic, and less expensive, photo editing programs."
1,Creating Keepsakes Scrapbook Designer Deluxe,"I had the same problem with installation that another reviewer had. Program kept saying it was still installing after several hours. I finally had a friend who works with computer software come install it. Additionally, program is not user-friendly for a novice like myself. I would not recommend this program."
1,don't try and ask broderbund for any help,"When I purchased this software I was very excited to get it installed onto my computer.I am not a computer wiz, my computer seemed to meet the system requirements but I couldnt get the program completelyinstalled to the computer. I kept getting a message saying it was still installing, even after 8 hours.Finally I emailed broderbund for some assistance, that ws almost 2 days ago. Their website advises that emails are responded to with in 8-10 hours if you contact them over the weekend or on a monday.I still haven't heard from them.After reading the previous reviews I have decided to return the program.Maybe it was better that I didnt get the program installed on the computer, I might have been even further disappointed."
3,Scrapbooking software,Product is good except when you click on graphics for a certain image they have listed you get a message saying it is not available. If so why is it even listed?
3,Wondering!,"Hi, wondering if anyone could tell if this program is just for printing, or is it on an actual dvd."
2,shody images,"While I didn't expect these images to be Michael Whelan quality, I did expect better than sloppy sketches. The majority of these images are black and white sketches that look like rough drafts rather than a finished piece. The color images are either cartoon characters which, while some were decent, wasn't what I was looking for, or they were fuzzy and unclear images. It wasn't all bad though, there were a few images that were pretty good. The program itself isn't very user friendly either. In order to view all of the images you have to go by artist rather than category. Overall, while there were a few images that were really cool (which is why I gave it a 2 instead of a 1), it wasn't worth the bother of buying it."
5,Beautiful!,"The design is beautiful, the quality is great, and it is inexpensive. However, it is not 100% cotton, so be careful if your baby has sensitive skin. The comforter is not very soft because of the material."
2,Glaring omission,"This seems to be a solid, well-made part that would do as expected... unfortunately the product description fails to note what the packaging says (purchasers can read it after it arrives, duh...): ""Designed for use with the GearRatchet (TM) system.""This is a proprietary-design item that is not usable without a proprietary T-handle from the same manufacturer. You need to buy into the whole ""system"" to make it work. OOPS, got another $30?"
4,An historical strategy manual from Japanese feudality,"The Heiho Okugisho has been written by Yamamoto Kansuke, strategist of the Takeda Clan. Actually his writings has been compiled in 1804 within a manual which is translated here by the famous Obata Toshishiro (Shinkendo master). In this both English & Japanese text you'll find definitions of Strategy, strategic techniques, the use of fields, the use of elements... many aspects of battle and individual Strategy. Despite of an expensive price for a low quality book (bad paper, page formating...), this is a very interesting manual, full of information and with a strong historical touch."
3,Raven Stay Hard,"The only reason I chose this band and its album was a video that I had saw a long time ago on MTV's Head Bangers Ball. The track 'On and On' was the song that I 'd seen. It was interesting that this band was a three-piece outfit during the resurgence of rock after the initial fade of disco in the late 70's to the early 80's rock. Raven does have a following that would have made current acts today a little bit jealous and their sound is much like the early metal/hard rock bands that tried to follow on the success of acts like Metallica, Megadeath, and the like. Like many other hard-to-get nearly out-of-print CDs I've added this one to my growing collection of one hit wonders of the early eigthies rock era brought forth by MTV's video age and influence in large by videos from its fledging program called the Head Banger's Ball."
3,Insightful,"Given 9/11, an international terrorist attack within the US is believable and almost expected. But this predates that horrible day, and captures some of the confusion such an event would mushroom.There are a broad range of characters in the book and they all have moderate substance to them.The author does a good job of portraying the sentiments of an ""occupied"" people. And, quite rightly, paints a dark picture of the ways, means and morality of British intelligence agencies. It also captures the ridiculous, irresponsible nature of bureaucracies and politicians when they are plunged into unfamiliar territory."
3,A Bit Of A Struggle Through,"If you can keep up with the descriptive details in this one, then you may really like it. This is nothing like some of Demille's other compelling novels (Plum Island, Lion's Game, Gold Coast) - in the sense that the focus seems to be on describing the cathedral in endless detail(which I gave up trying to keep up with). It was an interesting story, but I was anxious to get through it to start on his next book - I had to push through."
2,Not what I expected.,"This book did not live up to my expectations. Nelson DeMille is one of my go to authors, but this book was to long and it still left me with many many unanswered questions."
4,cathedral review,"Slower than some other DeMille novels in spots, but very interesting and educational about IRA conflict with GB. Still engaging overall and very exciting conclusion"
1,complete drivel,the only compelling character is burke and he is just a shallow archetype. other characters are stereotypes. plot development borders on hysterical
3,A good read,"Although somewhat dated in the new millenium, the descriptive detail and compelling characters are first rate."
3,Not DeMille's best effort,"This is a great 250 page book. However, it's more than 400 pages. Good story, but all the unnecessary sidebars are tiresome."
5,Cathedral by Nelson DeMille,"Another DeMille thriller. This one starting from page one. As I have experienced with ""Up Country"", Plum Island"", Spencerville"", and ""The Charm School"", I was so drawn into the plot, geographical and timeframe setting, there was somewhat of a let down when it ended....wanting it to continue. Having been to St Patrick's in NYC several times drew my interest into following locations I was familiar with. I did think the finale was somewhat drawn out."
5,"Terrific high-paced story! Smart, funny, and possible...",The basic plot grabbed my attention: St. Patrick's Cathredal is taken over by a renegade off-shoot of the IRA on St. Patrick's Day. Extremely well written. Superb detail of the terrorist operations and the think-tank actions of the NYPD SWAT. The author combines all of the elements of a great action drama. I look forward to his other works. I would love to see this as a movie...
2,Okay,"This book WAS filled with tons of action but it was REALLY hard to follow it towards the end. I love DeMille books, ao maybe I'm being a bit harsh but compared to his others it rates towards the bottom of the scale."
2,Kept waiting for something to happen,"I usually love Nelson DeMille and have devoured most of his other books. He is the rare writer that has that special quality of writing that combines wit, humor and intriguing stories. That being said, it was like pulling teeth to get through this book. I kept waiting for something to happen, for it to get interesting but it never did. The characters were one dimensional, predictable and boring. I wanted to like this so much..."
4,Another DeMille,"A very good book. Hated to put it down. Sad but somewhat predictable ending. Hard to imagine something like this happening in real life, but then there was 911. As usual Nelson DeMille certainly knows how to keep someone's interest."
2,"Laborious, to say the least.","This was my second DeMille book. After reading The General's Daughter, I started this one with great anticipation, and was sorely disappointed.The general plot was interesting and quite educational for a non-Irish such as myself. Hopefully the historic facts were accurate enough.As i kept reading, it became tedious, and eventually I had to skip long passages just to be able to finish the book, not losing much context in the process."
3,"Good Story, a bit slow","This was a good story, but it was a bit dragged out. I had a hard time reading a 500 plus page book that covers only a 24 hour period.I would say this wasn't one of his better books."
2,Weak,this book was a little weak in content. a lot of characters and tough to identify with most of them. not truly developed. And i'm a big Demille fan - this one fell short along w/rivers of babylon.
1,"Stupid, stupid, stupid.","I can't believe I wasted a week of my life reading this tripe. It reads like a mediocre made-for-TV movie, complete with campy dialogue and tired Irish stereotypes that will make you cringe. I enjoyed Gold Coast and thought I'd try some more of his work, but this will be the last DeMille novel I ever waste time on. Even if you're just looking for mindless summer beach reading, college-educated readers should try elsewhere. I should have known better. The decline in quality of popular novels is surely a sign of the approaching apocalypse."
3,Too long!,"The first half or maybe even three quarters of ""Cathedral"" is an entertaining read but it is simply over-long."
1,Huge disappointment,I have read most of DeMille's books and enjoyed them very much. This is the only one without a single compelling character or any interesting dialogue. It was a big disappointment.
4,IRA Splinter Group Takes Over St. Patrick's Cathedral,"This book was written about 25 years ago but still makes for a most exciting read. Plenty of excitement,quick page turning and suspense. There were a lot of pages, 575, but the author had plenty of time to develop the characters and the plot. Quite a St. Patrick's Day for all involved!"
3,Slow,"I read most of DeMille's other books, and thoroughly enjoyed his acerbic sense of humour, but this one was so slow that I put it down after reading 1/4 of it. I got bored. I probably will go back and finish it sometime, but there were so many other interesting books to read..."
2,Not as good as all the others,Thought this might be written by someone other than DeMille....didn't hold my attention....could put it down and not pick it up....didn't care.
4,A suspenseful read -- get a map.,"A great read, ""Cathedral"" is a very suspenseful account of how St. Patrick's Cathedral is taken over by terrorists. I sure could have used a map of the building to sort through the many scenes set throughout the Cathedral. After this and ""Charm School,"" I'm encouraged to read more of DeMille's work."
4,"Very exciting, but somewhat formulaic.","This book is absolutely exciting. Even though the premise was unlikely, and the end read like a made-for-TV-movie, I was so wrapped up in the action of this book that I would recommend this book. It would be especially good for long airplane flights, or on the beach. Read and enjoy."
2,confusing,"out of all the demilles, this one was a struggle to read. too many characters, lots of irish lingo, confusing right from the start. read any other demille and you will be better off - i have read them all and this is my least favorite. stick to word of honor, charm school, plum island and the gold coast - you can't go wrong with any of these."
3,Not my first choice. 2 Shows with repetition,"I am a huge fan but suggest you pick another volume unless you are obsessive-compulsive and just have to have them all. The back drop was different from the familiar WSM venue, so it was likely taped with less advanced equipment and it shows in the picture quality.The real fly in the ointment though is the repetition of 2 numbers ""On the Rock Where Moses Stood"" with the usual ensemble plus Hi-Lo Brown and ""I've Waited As Long As I Can"" featuring Hi-Lo Brown.There were two pieces featuring Paul Warren with good camera angles of his fingers on the neck of his fiddle. And, Uncle Josh played Bass in the back-ground on one of the versions of ""On the Rock Where Moses Stood"". Earl Scruggs does two guitar numbers that stand out. But over-all unless you have money burning through your pockets, pick some other sessions."
3,tub not included,"It seems, by product description, that manipulatives are included with the book. Must be purchased separately. Books look good, but may update review when I've received the tub of manipulatives."
4,this book makes a game of learning to read and spell,My four year old is so proud of the words he is making in the book. It engages him for long periods of time and he really has fun. He is learning to link the word with the concept.
5,Crossing the Line,"As a coaching educator and sport sociologist, in my opinion this video gives the viewer an in-depth examination of the issues and challenges facing a novice coach who inherits a high school girls' basketball team from a local ""legend."" The teacher-coach faces a small-town populace obsessed with winning (at almost all costs), poor sportsmanship, athletes who display hubris, an eating disorder,a sense of entitlement, parental over-involvement, and lack of respect for the coach's efforts, and many other issues. Very instructive film."
3,Raging humourist confronts AIDS,"This over-the-top tragicomedy was one of the first looks at what it feels like to confront your own personal HIV crisis. The author died several years ago, but his humor and throw-it-all-in-the-blender approach to writing about it live on. If you want to know what it feels like to be a gay Jewish techno-nerd living in Manhattan during the time of the plague, this is the book."
4,Enjoyable fun romantic and highly interesting little satire,"It's an original little story about a PR consultant falling in love with the human-like android astronaut she's meant to be promoting. Ann Magnusson is clearly on the lookout for Mr Right as the title suggests, but so far has had no luck. Until now, that is. However, what I found interesting is that the audience is kept guessing for most of the movie as to who she will actually end up with. And, ironically, as the android gradually starts acting more human-like, his human creator begins to act more robot-like. Malkovich in a dual role is suitably arrogant as the creator and suitably sweet as his android counterpart. Bring this back to video, please!"
5,An 80's comic masterpiece!,"This movie is absolutely hilarious, with moments that make you laugh out loud. I saw this movie when I was younger and I loved it. It's the type of movie, that after you're done watching it, just makes you feel good. Ann Magnuson is spectcular, her character is trendy, sexy and witty. John Malkovitch shines in this movie. It's one of the few performances of his that I do enjoy. Laurie Metcalf is dynomite! A VERY under-rated actress, Laurie is an incredibly funny woman and a true master of her craft. She steals the movie in her portayal of Sandra. ""I told you to call me Sandy!!!!!!"""
1,"Cheap material, unstable, picture not accurate and does not hold shoes well","My title pretty well sums it up. This is a cheap couple of pieces of plastic with some flimsy aluminum piping, but I was ok with that part for the price.However, I wanted to be able to use it vertically as the picture shows and it is not stable set vertically and worse, the shoes in the picture must all be little kids shoes.I use size 10 men and I could not fit four pair on any level so it became an unstable, wobbly nine shoe pair holder and worse, the shoes fall off easily as the bar level when set vertically is a bit steep for shoes without defined heel edges.Everytime I take a pair off the whole shebang wobbles and another pair or two fall off as well.If you are a women with a small foot size or a child and can use this in the horizontal mode it's worth the money, but for anyone with normal size feet who want to use it vertically as a space saver it is worthless as far as I am concerned and I am throwing mine away."
3,Lynk Shoe Rack,This item was somewhat difficult to put together and also a bit flimsy. But it does work fine for shoes with at least a slight heel when layed down as I needed mine.
3,"Space saver, just don't bump it!",This product does save a lot of space but the shoes tend to slide off. It's very annoying when you put one pair on and two slide off. I wouldn't buy this product again. This is definitely for shoes with at least a 1inch heel.
1,NOT 4x Speed DVDs - NOT COMPATIBLE,"If you are looking for ""up to 16x DVD-R"" this product would have been a GREAT buy. The problem is that right in the title it states 4X *Not up to 16X"". My DVD recorder is NOT compatible with anything but 4x and below. I specifically purchased this product to get 4x DVD-Rs. This is NOT what I received and I had to return them.Amazon was great on the return. There was no cost to me and the refund was processed quickly.Bottom line on this product - IT IS NOT 4x DVD-R MEDIA AND SHOULD NOT BE SOLD AS SUCH."
1,4X DVDs,Do not order these if you specifically need 4X. They are not available and they will send 8X.
1,DON'T ORDER IF YOU ONLY WANT 4X SPEED,"Same problem as others, I see. I can only use 4x. Product was advertised as 4x. When shipped, it's up to 8x and will not work in my machine. Buy elsewhere."
5,Twisted Sister's First LP,"This Is Twisted Sister first album. Released In 1982 and after all these years, It still headbangs. This Is a classic metal album(for a hairband). If you like songs that have that anthem attitude to It, this Is It. Best tracks that rock off this album are ""Shoot Em Down"" and ""Destroyer"". This Is an 80's classic, get it now while they remastered It, It sounds better then ever."
5,A classic album receives the treatment it deserves.,"This is THE reissue of the year. Finally, someone got it right. I'm so damn tired of great albums being ruined by lousy remastering. No overly compressed brickwalled crap here, this is the real deal. This is the best this album has ever sounded. I've owned the original UK Secret Records release on vinyl for thirty years, and this sounds even better than that. All of the original elements have been restored and mixed to perfection. Gone are those wimpy electronic drums that replaced the original drum tracks on the mid-80's Atlantic reissue. The bass level is back where it belongs. That thin, tinny production has been replaced with a full, beefy sound, but it hasn't been overdone. It's just right.The bonus extras are great too. This rates a 10/10. :headbang:Even if you think you're not a Twisted Sister fan, you owe it to yourself to check this out."
1,"Get the original cd pressing, not the spitfire remix","This remix is terrible sounding, what you need is the original disc, I have the original 1985 roadrunner disc which is made in japan, it sounds waaaaaayyyyyyy better then the remix. I think there is also 2 other versions which came out in 1985, get one of those 3 and not the remix which is one of the worst remasters I've ever heard. It will cost you a pretty penny (50-100$) but its well worth it. I would give that version 5 stars but amazon doesn't have either of the 3, probably due to the rarity of them."
3,Not Their Best...But It Does Have It's Moments,"""Under the Blade"" features a ""different"" sound than what most SMF's might expect from Twisted Sister. The songs are at times very similar to early Black Sabbath. Plodding, dirge-like tunes with only flashes of the hair-metal like guitar riffs they would popularize with ""Stay Hungry"". Tunes like ""Destoryer"" and ""Sin after Sin"" emphasize this. Both feature a slower, plodding pace that emphasize A.J. Pero's drumwork and Mark Mendoza's bass. The screaming guitars take a backseat on these songs, and they aren't bad, just not what you would expect. On the other hand, tunes like ""Under the Blade"", ""I'll Never Grow Up"" and ""What You Don't Know"" are all shaded with what would become Twisted Sister's signature sound on ""Stay Hungry"" and ""Come Out and Play"". If you are a fan of the band, then this is a must own, but if your only interested in the hits...stick with ""Stay Hungry"" and download the title song from this disk."
1,Original = Good / Remaster = Baaaad,"I totally agree with the other reviewer who said that this remaster is a disaster! The original mix shook my speakers, kicked my head in and threw me out of the window whilst this release sounds like a drumstick hitting a biscuit tin. Those disco-synth drums are so heavy - not. From SMF to tone deaf, I say. The revised lyric of Shoot'em Down should state 'He's a re-masturbator', referring to the dude who thought this one up.....mmm, quite good that. Bring back Pete Way and Secret Records. Anyone got a copy?"
3,What's with censorship???,The album is good but it's censored. Why would you a censored album and not tell someone it is censored. Otherwise the album is great!
4,Totally Twisted,"This is a great CD. There are a few misses but it is a lot more good material then bad. While some tracks were still weak, I would recommend this CD. Highly."
1,AVOID this Junk--not worth $9.99,"Th other reviewer was generous..Played few hours.Setting up park & rides are fun but the day-to-day is TOOO tedious. AND the software is buggy so many times--won't let me place the rides. Also, no instructions--took me while to figure out rides won't run without a generator---awful design and presentationFor new software--not impressive...belongs in $3.99 budget section!"
2,Kind of boring,I bought this for my 3 year old and he lost interest very quickly. The buttons to make Superman punch are difficult for a youngster to use.
4,"Lost Arts : A Cook's Guide to Making Vinegar, Curing Olives,","how to cure olives or make cheese, these are some of things I wish that my grandparents would have toughs me if they were alive. such things are a truly becoming a lost art in our fast paced society. however, thanks to this and other books we the novice cook/gardener will find this vary pleasing book to have and use."
3,Not what I had expected,"I was slightly disappointed with this book. The title and description led me to think that it was going to be more of an instruction book. It actually turned out to be an overview of the history of each of the items listed with a smattering of recipes. There was a certain amount of instruction in the book but it buried in chatty discussions about 'the old world'.There is a certain level of useful information and a brief list of resources ( about 15 businesses total). However this was written in 1995 and there are no websites listed, just mailing addresses and phone numbers, though most of the business are easy to find on the internet. I googled about half of them and they all seem to be in business still.A great read for foodies but if you're looking for a useful text on producing your own (vinegar, goat cheese, mustards, etc) this is not the title for you."
4,Tactical Assistance on the Home Front,"David Clarke has taken the battle for our children to a new level. Using humor, common sense and sound principles, Clarke helps the frustrated parent gain footing in the battle referred to as parenting.Clarke systematically briefs the reader through each age level while offering excellent advice on the training and nurturing of our children. While each section is well written and easily understandable, Clarke excels at breaking down the mystery of the teenager that has, or eventually will infiltrate your home.The bottom line is that with patience and a genuine love for our children, we can overcome the enemy within and raise healthy, strong children."
3,Possible title confusion,"The ISBN number listed for Risa Kirk, Trade Secrets, Harlequin Superromance No. 408, links to this title, Trade Secrets, by the same author. It is unclear whether these were variant titles or two different books."
3,EL FINAL DE UNA SERIE UN POCO DIFICIL DE ACEPTA,"EN ESTA SAGA FINAL.. LA SERIE ROBOTECH DA SU PUNTO FINAL, CON UN COMIENZO. NO QUIERO ADELANTAR NADA Y CONTAR EL FINAL DE ESTA SAGA.. PERO EN PARTICULAR PARA MI, ESPERABA UN POCO MAS EMOCION Y SINGULARIDAD EN EL FINAL.LA TRAMA EN ESTA SAGA, ES MUY BUENA. DESPUES DE LA SAGA MACROSS, CONSIDERO QUE ESTA ESTA MEJOR QUE LA SAGA DE LOS MAESTROS.EN ESTA SAGA VUELVEN LOS VERITECHS AHORA COMO ALPHAS, Y PODEMOS DISFRUTAR DE LAS MOTOCICLETAS CYCLONS, MUY BIEN ELABORADAS.EL ENEMIGO. ""INVID"" UN POCO TONTO, PERO MORTAL.ESTE DVD NO TIENE LEYENDAS EN ESPA√ëOL."
5,Great classic jazz,"This CD has 13 old standards plus Johnny Smith's composition 'Walk, Don't Run!' which was a big hit for the Ventures. Johnny Smith's guitar playing is just great. The songs are all short, so there are no lengthy solos, but the guitar solos are all gems. Some musicians can handle slow romantic, songs but not fast numbers. Others do well on uptempo material but bog down on ballads. Johnny Smith excels with both. On the slower numbers, his tone is beautiful and he is able to keep the pulse of the song going even when the beat is slow. On the uptempo numbers, his playing is amazingly fast and clean. The focus is very much on Johnny Smith, but the backing, and brief solos, by the rest of the group are quite good. It is interesting to hear Johnny Smith backed up by a second guitarist. The two work quite well together."
5,A Great NYC History Book,"If you are looking for a thorough and well-organized history of New York City this book will suit your needs. Sure, it may not be as detailed as ""Gotham"" but most of us will not want that level of depth. This book is wisely broken into sections that mirror the terms of the various governors and mayors of the Big Apple-and, really, why wouldn't that be the best way to present this story. The reading is quick and clear and you'll know everything the average person would want to know about NYC."
2,deadly boring,"Having just moved to NYC I bought this dog expecting to get a quick brush up on the fascinating story of America's Greatest City. Instead I was burdened with endless trivia about who was mayor or who ran Tammany Hall at any given moment in New York's history.Obviously this angle is part of the big picture of The City, but it comes off the page very flat and, sadly, uninteresting. There is scant attention paid to the million and one other details about New York life that one really wants to hear about: art, culture, social life, transportation, etc.The writing is intelligent enough. The author is clearly a smart person with a lot of interest in his subject. It's just that enduring this book is more like watching someone's vacation slides and less like the inspiring, terse and revealing story you hope you'd get when you bought the thing."
5,Unparalleled,"The greatness here is that Grouchyfriendly is not a compilation of homogeneous songs. The joy is that each song is entirely unique and whole. That ""Melt"" is a great song is no argument. But in addition to ""Melt,"" there is the gentle ""Show Me the Way Home,"" the slick ""This Business of Love,"" the funny and profound, ""Alcohol Affection"" and the soothing ""It's Alright."" There is a depth of expression in Phil Roy's voice that is real. The guitar work of Heitor Pereira and Ricardo Silveira weave throughout to create a sound that is unparalleled in anything I have heard. Each time I listen to Grouchyfriendly, I am stirred and amazed but it's depth and subtlety. Now that I have found Phil Roy, I can't imagine being without him."
5,Grouchyfriendly,"Amid the myriad of teen-pop comes an album so raw, so real that it grows on you with each listen. ""Grouchyfriendly"" is a visceral, gut-wrenching collection of songs punctuated with a series of exceptional musical performances by Phil Roy and his guests.Contrary to what some might think, in exploring so many complex emotions, the artist produces a uniquely uplifting, hopeful work. A terrific disc for a long drive, or for late at night."
5,A songwriter's songwriter,"I have kept ""grouchyfriendly"" in my CD player for weeks. It will probably be there this time next year. I listen to these songs and hear my own life. One of the few essential CD's to come out in the Y2k."
4,Insight not Babble,"Found this CD through a search for Colin Hay. Bought it on a lark. 'SHOW ME THE WAY HOME' raises the hair on the back of my neck. Very few songs do that to me. Kudos for the 'If you like..""section. Would never have found Phil Roy without it.Would love to see him in concert. Keep up the good work."
4,Phil Roy is a mosaic of talent.,"I have rarely found one album that brings together so many different types of songs, moods, and voice quality... each as talented as the next. I highly recommend this album...there's something about his work (lyrics and music) that infuses one with feeling. There is also a raw creative edge to some of his work, that I think is fabulous - and welcome. It was well worth my money...!"
5,Nice and showy!,"It clinks a little and it's wide and I love this watch. Another one with easy adjusting to size if it's a little big.I get compliments on this one. Good quality, fun watch."
5,Buy it for the Art,"Ernest Lussier was my beloved high school art teacher and I can say with confidence that the illustrations in this book alone make it worth buying. Miss you, Mr Lussier."
3,Works,Nice to do under drawings. Really erases well unlike regular colored pencil which have wax in them (won't erase at all).
5,Beautiful Christ-Centered Poetry,"""This is the badge of the friends of the Man of Sorrows:the mark of the cross, faint replica of His,become ubiquitous now; it spreads like a wild blossomon the mountains of time and in each of the crevices.""from ""The Sign of the Cross,"" Page 19."
5,Music For Your Soul - CD by david castle,The album so many of us have waited for! AWESOME! David surpasses himself and has reached a new level of connecting with the people through his music. Thank you david for your beautiful gift of artistry and Spirit combined!
5,An artist shares his gifts,"This outstanding collection covers a wide range of musical genres, from pop to R&B to bossa nova and beyond. david castle has shared some of his deepest thoughts and feelings on this album; it is truly the expression of a life lived in music. Listen to, ""Purple Butterfly"" and be moved. Listen to, ""Don't Wanna Be An Extra"" and grin. Listen to all of it - you'll never forget it."
3,detour,"Not a bad movie, the only thing that was unbearable 100% of the time was the video quality. I've never ever seen such poor video compression and DVD authoring in my life. There are awful jagged flickering lines at the top and bottom of the screen. It's really really poor."
2,"barely decent, huge hills have eyes ripoff","If it wasn't for the two hot main chicks, I wouldve just turned it off. The main 'i'm white, but think i'm black' guy was very annoying. I wish they wouldve killed him. The easy to kill villains looked too human. The main big one was decent. It had some good gore, but i dont think its worth waiting for. The only reason I would recommend it is to make fun of it. One pet peeve about horror movies is when a truck is chasing you down a dirt road, get off the damn road!"
3,OK apart from one actor,"Anyone else get annoyed by the really bad acting from the Eminem wannabe in this film - I would kill him myself if I was his mate in the film, for a low budget indie flick it was ok and would get 4 stars if the dud actor was deleted from it"
2,Not worth the effort,"Though not a 'B' movie, this just about scrapes the bottom of the horror barrel. An extremely elementary effort, I found myself endeared to no character, so I wasn't frightened about what might happen to any of them. I was also bored. No character development, no background information, a predictable storyline and ridiculous gore cheapened this film effort. I even wanted to turn off the movie about 30 minutes into viewing, but I figured I'd stick it out. Not worth it."
2,"""What Up, Yo?""...","Oh dear, not only is DETOUR a poor HILLS HAVE EYES clone, but it also contains one of the most annoying, idiotic characters I've seen in any horror movie! You'll know him as soon as he opens his mouth, uttering one pitiful ""urban slang"" comment after another. Absolutely ridiculous! As for the film itself, it has your typical stick-women and young dweebs in danger. The extremely non-threatening, desert-dwelling ""cannibals"" look more like tourists who wandered onto the set by accident. No suspense, shocks, or originality to be found. Ugh..."
2,An Indie The Hills Have Eyes,"This was a decient low budget film.The story was good,the girls were hot,and there were some decent special effects.I would suggest that you watch ""The Hills Have Eyes"" insted of this,they are basically the same story but on different budgets."
2,"I am a B horror flick fan, but...","I thought that this movie fell short of even B horror flick standards. I did like the scenic shots of the film but the dialog and the ""mutants"" of this film didn't really hold my attention. The ""mutants"" were not even mutants at all. They looked like everyday people that you would see on the street. Well, they didn't look disfigured is what I mean. The guy that was acting like he was part of the ""Rap Culture"" was the most irritating of them all. I really wanted to like this movie, but I am sorry that I didn't. I don't recommend this movie to anyone. Even those B horror fans."
3,Mix of harp and harmonica.,This CD contains blues harp and harmonica pieces. Some could also be considered folk and others more novelty--i.e. train pieces. By far the best song is the lone one by Ollis Martin. My rating can be qualified by the fact that my interest lies primary in Delta harp Blues.
1,not worth it,picked up this book before skimmin' through it...guess i should have....me and my buddies were cracking up.....so not worth it.....there are plenty of better ways to meet girls than this.....think ill use this book as a beer coaster from now since i'm too lazy to return it....
1,Learn Grammar,"I would not even give this item one star, try minus five stars! Mr. Mastroianni, do the reading community a favor and please return to elementary school and learn how to spell and make use of proper grammer before you attempt a second ""book."" The only thing that this book taught me is how not to buy any more dating books from middle-aged, low class guidos who would be lucky to score with a 45 year old out of shape divorcee with two kids who hangs out smoking Marlboro reds at the town bar on a Monday night."
4,Ignatius Studay guide to the Gospel of Matthew,"As with each guide from this publisher, biblical text is included with study notes and a broad cross reference to other scripture. Study questions and points to ponder are included for each biblical chapter. I have found this series to be very helpful in putting in 15 minutes a day of regular study and review. This has been very helpful in opening up my understanding of the scripture verses I have heard for so many years in Mass. Well worth considering for study throughout the year, but a good idea for study during Lent - give it a try!"
4,Just a taste of a great artist,"The Queen of Soul has produced so many memorable songs that this cd only has a fraction of her work. The songs that are here are wonderful and indicative of her tremendous range. Aretha Franklin never sings the same song the same way so it's always worth checking into her live versions. The MP3 versions are a good way to get your favorites without getting the whole album. She doesn't give to many concerts, a pity. I am grateful though that she has lived so long and continues to produce great vocals."
5,Great Stuff,I received this as a gift one year & would not be without it. Bought more this time to give as gifts.
2,some classics,"This video offers a couple of classic situations, but not as much as I had hoped. Too much talk, not enough laughs."
3,A little disappointed,"I read all 10 reviews and since they were all pretty favorable, I ordered it. One of the reviews claimed this body bolster was over 5' long. This one is 3'. Another review said that if you were under 6' tall and 200 lbs it would be too big. It's not. I wish it was longer and firmer. I guess I can't complain too much as $20 isn't a bad price and the shipping was free."
2,Ok for the price,"For $20, I guess it's ok. I bought this for my husband. A week after he used it, one of the edges started to rip open, so I had to sew them back. And this body pillow IS BIG!! Unless you are over 6 foot and 200 lbs, this pillow is not for you. But of course you can use it for something else, like blocking a baby from falling down from the bed."
2,Understuffed,"I love the size of this Nautica bolster pillow. But it is woefully understuffed. As such, it doesn't support your back, as I'd wished, while sitting up in bed. Decorative only!"
1,not as promised,This book was not in acceptable condition. Guess we all have our own ideas of what acceptable is. I did not even want to touch the book.
2,NO LCD to view your pix!,This camera has no LCD so it's missing one of the main advantages of instant feedback for learning digital photography.Moral: you get what you pay for.
1,Bad idea!,"My daughter received this camera for Christmas. Came with no software and no way to get pictures off of the camera. Contacted Toysrus who said that I needed to contact Sakar. Did so 5 times, have yet to hear from them. Bad customer service. Would rate camera pics if I could get them off the camera. Don't waste you time."
5,Worthy of Use,I believe this camera is well worth it's value if you look at other good cameras they have 5 mega pixles but they cost 80$ to even over 100$! but this camera dosn't have as many pixles only like 3.1 mega pixles but hey for a 1.9 mega pixle diffrence it ends up being a 50$ and up differennce than the expencive ones! I strongly- and truly suggest this camera to all of the boy's and girls who'd like to learn digital photography.P.S. Buy a Tripod to inrease picture quality <usually $5.00>
1,Don't waste your time or money,"This digital camera is awful. My 11 year old daughter received this camera for Christmas also. Last night when we went to download the pictures, we found that it did not come with a Cd-driver. But after a few minutes of trying to get it to download via another program that I have, we found that it wouldn't have mattered anyway since the batteries(which were new at Christmas) in the camera had died and all of the pictures were lost. My daughter was heartbroken to find out that all the pictures she had taken at Christmas were gone.There is also no LCD screen to view pictures taken. But I guess you get what you pay for, and I won't be wasting my time or money on these cheap items again."
1,Buy a better camera from a name brand company,"My daughter bought this camera and it appears to recognize the USB bus and beeps and puts a little ""PC"" in its window but it fails to be detected correctly by Windows XP Home. I tried Sakar's drivers from their website, contacted them, and downloaded drivers they recommended and Windows XP still can't read the camera. When I complained to Sakar, they said I was loading the drivers incorrectly, which I wasn't. I've worked with various iterations of Windows Operating Systems from Windows 3.0 through Windows XP, so I know when something is not working with Windows XP. All the drivers in the world won't enable a bad camera from being read. Save your money an buy a quality Nikon or Canon or Pentax or Minolta. You won't have this headache."
1,IT SUCKS!,"Batteries loses power after short usage. If battery dies, you lose your pictures. While the camera is ""storing"" photos... it uses battery power, thus battery loss is quick. We plugged it to our pc one time... after that, it doesn't always download, and twice it shut my computer down. It is NOT worth the money to spend!! I thought it would be great for my 7 yr old son to learn to use a camera, and take his own photos. It is more of a hassle than an enjoyment because he cannot get his photos to download."
3,"Good for a child, but that's about it.","My 4 year old received this camera for Christmas. He loves taking pictures of EVERYTHING, so a digital camera comes in handy for not spending money on film developing. He learned how to use it very quickly. He has already taken around 200 pictures in just a couple of weeks, and the camera is holding up well. The only problem with this camera, is the pictures are VERY low resolution. They are slightly dark and EXTREMELY pixelated. If you're looking for quality photos, this is not the camera for you. If you're looking for a cheap digital camera for a child, this one will work fine."
2,Disappointed,The product did not apply as directed .... was darker than I had anticipated ......needs to be made available in wider widths to accommodate larger windows.
2,not sure about this product,"I've got mixed feeling about this product. It's not sticky and works like cling film. The problem I have is that after a while, it doesn't stick to the glass and I have to redampen it to get it to stick. The pattern is nice but I wouldn't buy this again."
4,Looks great,Looks awesome on a window with a bad view to my sun porch. Can't see much through it. The only thing I think it was missing was a grid to cut straight lines. I used post its to make a pattern and it looks awesome!
5,Very nice!,"I had done some internet research looking for a window film for a basement bathroom because I wanted to get rid of the curtains. Found the Magnolia one online, and when I did a price search through froogle the amazon site came up as the best price. Arrive quickly. Was very easy to install, stays in place, and looks great from both inside the room and from outside of house. Only negative: Did not come with squeegee type tool to work out the bubbles for smooth application. Luckily I had kept one from an earlier purchase that did the trick."
2,disappointing,"i've used window film before, so i had high expectations going in. the picture is pretty, but the film itself is just printed with the photo of stained glass. there is no texture to add realism as with the clematis/water lily print and the frank loyd wright-esque film. it does let light filter through and is very simple to put up, it just looks much cheaper and less like stained glass than the films that have the variation and texture."
2,Disappointed and Frustrated,"This product was very difficult to apply. I had a sharp utility knife and a 90 degree ruler and followed the instructions completely, but it was still very difficult to get an even cut and to get the dimensions exactly right. I only knew I needed the 90 degree ruler and the utility knife from reading previous reviews, these items were never mentioned in the directions. There are no grid lines on the back of the product. It was a wet mess until it dried the next morning and then I could see all the places where it hadn't cut evenly. I had to go back and try to patch all the little spots which was very difficult. I was applying this to a window that was divided up into little squares so that complicated the process. I have read that other similar products on here are much easier to deal with and I would recommend trying one of those instead. I still gave it two stars because it is very beautiful when completed, but if I had to do it over again I would try something else."
3,Liked it but had problems,"Even though I followed the instructions to the letter, I couldn't get the bubbles out and one of the panels is curling up at the corners. Just too expensive for these kind of problems."
5,looks nice,I used this for my bathroom window and it doesn't allow anyone from the outside to peek in. Really nice product for my purpose
2,It smells,"If you place this stuff in a window that gets direct sun, it will heat up and give off a plastic smell. I've installed it in a few windows and am about to rip it off and throw it away due to the smell. I've given it a few weeks, but the smell is getting worse. Looks good, but I'm also concerned of the health effects of breathing in plastic. If you smoke, then you probably don't care about your health and probably won't be able to smell the plastic, so go for it."
3,pro and cons,"On the one hand, it is easy to apply, and as long as one follows the directions, it stays up.On the other hand, at night with no light going thru, it looks like colored vinyl stuck to your window.This particular pattern repeats if you buy more sheets and want to cover a larger window. But for a standard size window I am not sure this pattern is best. the ""stained glass"" effect is marred by parts of the pattern being cut off at the end of the sheet. It makes it look fake on the window. Ultimately I removed this pattern and used something less busy. The overall effect at day and with some light was better than nighttime."
3,dont expect a great exterior view,"This product went on easily, looks great from the inside, but dont expecta great view from the outside as it is hardly visible."
2,"nice inside, ugly outside lol","i bought this at home depot. Its very nice to look at when light shines. Im on the fence whether Id buy it again for my next project. Is it almost like stained glass but isnt but i knew that and that is not my issue lolbasically the problem is if your indoor house has no lights or turned off. the outside of the window with stain will look gross and rusty and flat and cheap too.If the indoor lights are on, then its beautiful.just saying!Corey out!"
1,Magnolia Window Film.....so HORRID!,"I ordered two rolls of this Magnolia window film from Amazon, and it arrived today. I was horrified! The flowers are HUGE, not at all like the ones in the picture. And the colors are very, very DARK! This doesn't look at all like the window film in the picture. It's UGLY, gaudy and tacky! I am very disappointed! I would give it a -5 stars, if I could! This is going to have to go back to Amazon. From now on I will buy window film in person, so I can see what I'm getting!"
5,great pot of soup!,I love this soup. Black beans in any form make for a great meal. Nueva Cocina has the formula down just right! It's not too salty like so many other brands. The soup is also just the right consistency. Good stuff indeed!
1,"Well, it didn't make it worse","This product does not work...at all. Like most, basically all, acne solutions, this product is a lie. I had very bad acne a couple of years ago and tried everything, including these tablets. Nothing helped clear my face until I went to the dermatologist. If acne is a real problem for you, you need to see a dermatologist; you will not regret it!!! On another note, these tablets did absolutely nothing, made my skin neither better nor worse. So basically, it was like I threw money away."
5,"Well-Conseived Follow-Up to ""Man In The Mirror""","As indicated I purchased this and ""Man In The Mirror"" together,having heard no other '80's-era Passport outside of the verydissappointing and inconsistant ""Blue Tatoo"",but both blew me away!Much of this follows in ""Mirror's"" lead with a series of catchy electro funk/fusion pieces spiked with a dollop of electric rock guitar,many featuring the wonderfulvocals of Victoria Miles,who brings to mind Style Council singer DC Lee. Most impressive though is ""Talisman"",featuring Passport meastro Klaus Dolinger himself on bamboo flute along with Miles's sudtle chanting.Even the albums slowest cut ""Auryn"" is far too clever and ambitious to conjur up any Kenny G-ish nightmares.So a word to all Passport fans-don't let the late date put you off becausenothing here will dissappoint!"
3,Passport??,"While this album/CD is still quite listenable, it tends to sound alot like it ought to be a Harold Faltameyer(SP?) of ""Fletch"" fame offering rather than Passport and it is really the first Passport release I was not completely happy with. save your money and buy some earlier Passport."
1,PIECE OF CRAP,"I plan to return this blender immediately, the first time I used it, it completely leaked all over the counter creating a huge mess, I had two friends including a computer scientist attempt to use this blender and they also had significant leakage from the bottom. For the price I expected it to WORK! I expected better of products sold by Target."
1,not the best,"I had mine a month and while making a smoothie of milk, frozen fruit and protein powder the motor blew out.Unfortunately I don't have my reciept or box so I will hope Oster will give me an option here.I also had the problem of having to stop blending, remove the Blend 'n Go cup and stir before continuing. The large blender jar was the same except all I had to do with that is take off the lid and stir.I will look at another brand when I replace it."
2,A not-so-great collection of Foreigner's greatest hits,"Needing an 80s pop-rock fix one day, I snapped up this particular disc to stanch my craving. Unfortunately, I found it to be a bit of a disappointment-more than a few of the tunes were the radio edit renditions. Also, I discovered that this was released before one of my all-time Foreigner faves, ""I Want To Know What Love Is"", hit the scene. So now it's not only got cut-down tunage, `Foreigner: Records' is incomplete.Fortunately, I eventually discovered the group's more-recent `The Very Best... And Beyond!'. It has the full cuts of all their greatest hits included here, as well as a few more top tunes that saw airplay after `Records' hit the street. So if you want the best Foreigner Greatest Hits compilation, skip this one and grab `...And Beyond!' instead!`Late"
5,Hot Blooded Hits,If you have Agent Provocateur and Inside Information and would like to know how they sounded like before that this collection perfectly fits your need. I know it is not complete but I love every song included. Particularly I like Feel Like A First Time and Head Games. And the last track Hot Blooded(live version) wraps up this collection. What is good about this compilation is most of the hits are non-ballad and Waiting For A Girl Like You sounds so great among the rockers. Since Inside Information the lead singer Lou Gramm went solo and they made an album called Unusual Heat without Lou. Lou rejoined the band in 1995 and their solid work Mr.Moonlight was produced. I just look forward to their new album.
3,Energetic songs.,"I've never considered Foreigner to be a band that's very original. They have written some pretty good and energetic tunes though. I'm not a big fan of them, but I did add this package of hits to my collection some time ago. The songs that I like the most are ""Head Games,"" ""Waiting for a Girl Like You,"" and ""Urgent."" I think that ""Waiting for a Girl Like You"" is Foreigner's best song. If you like straight-ahead rock, then give Records a listen."
3,Incomplete,"I'm a huge Foreigner fan and love every song on this set. HOWEVER, I cannot stand it when a greatest hits collection has edited versions of the hits! Granted, these probably were the versions played on the radio, but 'Feels Like The First Time' has been butchered! Still, if you're looking for an introduction to one of the best pop/rock groups of the '70's and '80's, this would be a great place to start. And the live version of 'Hot Blooded' ROCKS!!"
3,"You know these songs, you will never escape them","I guess it's not easy putting together a 'Best Of' album. The producers just can't resist throwing in TOO MANY songs. You want just the hits, but you end up with 10 good ones and 6 bad ones (and 2 you've never even heard before).But whoever put this one together RESTRAINED themselves. They were disciplined. They held back. They didn't completely [goof] it up!Just 10 songs, all of which are very good. If you don't like Def Leppard-esque Top Forty rock music, you won't want this. But if you like those old, well-written, high-energy rock songs from the 1980s, you'll love this.So if it's so good, why not give it five stars? Because... well... it's Foreigner, for chrissakes. Sure the songs are good, but this band is a guilty pleasure at best.P.S. They shouldn't have used a live version of Hot Blooded. It's cheesy. The original is much better."
3,"do, do, do, do....you're as cold as ice!!!!","Having been born in 1979, I never experienced Foriegner in their hayday. This album is what it is. A collection of their biggest hits that lasts just over 40 minutes. To tell you the truth, that is about as much of Foreigner as I can take in one sitting. This is a fun album that you can sing along to with friends since everyone knows these songs even though they don't know Foreigner intamitely. Having heard one of their other albums once, this is more than enough Forigner for me. (3.5 stars)"
3,Another Bad WEA Compilation,Another collection made for the LP age but deficient by CD standards. Contains the live version of Hot Blooded.
2,What's the point?,"Either they were bored out of their minds that they released this or simply they did not have enough criteria to put more songs. Its an incomplete of greatest hits but for some reason I don't take it as serious as their other two releases of greatest hits such as The Complete Greatest Hits or the before that one which is The Very Best and Far Beyond..Don't buy this one, get any other of the ones mentioned above."
2,"One good song, a few OK","The only song that really holds up, I think, is ""Urgent"". That song still sounds good. ""Cold As Ice"" and ""Double Vision"" sound dated, but not bad. The rest, like ""Dirty White Boy"" and ""Waiting For A Girl Like You"" were lousy the day they were recorded and they're lousy today.Hot Blooded is live. Who buys greatest hits albums for live tracks? You want the originals that you've heard on the radio a hundred billion times.Also, ""No Blue Morning"".This compiliation is preferable to others I have seen because it does NOT include ""I want To Know What Love Is"", which is one of the sappiest songs written in the English language."
2,I had to put it down.,"I usually get drawn into Huxley's books, but this one is his first--and thankfully only--attempt at comedy. It is dreadfully unfunny and unstimulating, a contrast most of the rest of his body of work. One thing I noticed was that half of the dialogue ended with exclamation points, and that is way too much! Thus, I don't recommend that you read this book!"
2,"Aimless lives, aimless story","As a huge fan of ""Brave New World,"" I picked up ""Antic Hay"" anticipating the same depth of social commentary. I was sadly disappointed. Huxley does present an occasionally mildly entertaining picture of post-WW1, upper-middle-class life in London, much like Fitzgerald did for New York in ""The Great Gatsby,"" but the meandering, pointless lives of the characters produced a meandering, pointless novel. In this regard, I was also reminded of ""Catcher in the Rye,"" another novel whose place on the dais of great literature is undeserved. Altogether an unsatisfying read."
3,Chris Howard's Excellent Weastig Game review,This book is an ok book because it is a clue book.As I read through it I am starting to understand it a little better.The bookhas a good effect to it.There is lots of interesting parts to it.This book is a little hard and I recomend this book to people only over the 7th grade and up.
2,the Westing Game,"This book is about 16 people gather for the reading of Samuel W. Westing's will. No one knows that they are related to this man. To their surprise, the will turns out to be a contest, challenging the heirs to find out who among them is Westing's murderer. This book is extremely hard to follow and very jumpy. I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys a mystery, trying to figure things out (the context not the mystery), and for people way ahead of their time. I hope this helped!"
4,good book Marin county,"This was an okay book. I loved the story telling; it made me want to imagine what it looked like. Also, I think that there should be a little more story telling in the book. Great job writing it!"
4,Westing Game Review,My name is J.H and I am in the 7th grade. I just read the Westing Game by Ellen Raskin and I thouhgt the book was good. The setting of the book was In Sunsetowers in Michgan and the most intreesting charter was Sandy McSouthernes because he disguised himself as someone else. I felt the ending of the book was ok because it was slow and borring. I would recoomend this book because it was cool.
3,The Westing Game,"(...) I am in the 7th grade. I just read The Westing Game by Ellen Raskin and I thought it was ""alright"". The setting of the book was Sunset towers and the most intresting character was Sam Westing because he had so many different personalities. I felt the ending of the book was good because it was very complex in how it all came together.I would reccomend this book for kids my age."
2,Westing Game,"(...)I am in the 7th grade.I just read The Westing Game by Ellen Raskin and i thought the book was interesting. The setting of the book was at Sunset Towers in M.I and the most interesting character was Turtle becasue she was the one who was mostly into the game, cared about the death of Sam Westing and the money. I felt the ending of the book was boring because they didn't leave a descriptive ending. I would recommend this book becasue it is a great mystery."
4,Zach's Book Review,"I liked The Westing Game. It was about a man named Samuel Westing. At the reading of his will, the will turned out to be a contest. One of the people there was the murderer and the others would have to figure out who it was. They went through blizzards, burglaries, and bombs to get 2 million dollars. This book was very exciting and at the same time really mysterious. I would recommend The Westing Game. It was a great book!"
4,The Westing Game,"I absolutely loved The Westing Game by Ellen Raskin. It is a classic story of an old millionaire, Sam Westing, who died suddenly on Halloween night. Following his death, sixteen heirs, his nieces and nephews, were called together for the reading of his will. They find, however, that this is no ordinary will; instead it is the outline for an outrageous game in which the heirs will be paired together in an attempt to find which one of them is Westing's murderer. Each pair gets a set of clues, and will work together to solve the mystery and win the game in order to gain the inheritance. Over the course of their search, robberies and bombings cause the will to become more than just a game, but rather a chance to save themselves and their partners, before Westing's murderer catches them, too."
4,The Westing Game was intreguing,"The Westing Game is a confusing novel, yet it kept me reading to find out what happened in the end where it all comes together. This book is a whirlwind of events with a splash of characters. Mystery, murder, and comedy are all beautifully mixed to create the wonderful book "" The Westing Game""."
3,"Great, but something made it bad","I though it was a wonderful, great well-writen mystery book, butsomewhat confuesing.It ends in a huge,unpredictible twist that no one would guess will reading it.If you want a quick, good book that you may reread later, read this.Way to confuessing,in some parts."
3,The book was kind of confusing.,"In the beginning of The Westing Game, every one came to the little hotel (sunset Towers)thats when it got kind of confuing. But it was worth reading even though i don't like reading at all! So, it was a pretty good book in my world."
1,Predictable,"It was OK. I thought it was really predictable, even as a fifth grader. I will not spoil this putrid book, but I will just say the desciptions just gave it all away."
2,Worst Book I've ever been forced to read.,"I thought the westing game, when I read it, was bad. It had spots of action but no real theme. It left me wondering at the end who did it. I personally do not like mystery stories. Perhaps it is my SCI-Fi bias that prevented me from enjoying this book but I never could get into it. You must like mystery stories to enjoy this book."
5,Westing Game Rules!!!!,I love the book The Westing Game!!! I got it for Christmas this year and have read it 5 times since. It is a great book for mystery lovers.I GIVE THIS BOOK 5 STARS!!!!!!!!
3,The Westing Game,"This book is starts out with a letter that says some stuff about Sunset Towers and that there is places left to be rented .So they go there and rent some rooms , but there is a catch . They came to solve who killed Sam Westing. The game starts with 16 people with clues to figure out who killed Sam Westing .I kind of like the book . The reason I didn't like the book because it is to complicated because all the characters. I would recommend this book because it' s about a murder that gets solved."
4,The game,"For a game that has money on the line, would you risk you life? In THE WESTING GAME by Ellen Raskin, a hotel full of people do just that. This epic mystery novel is full of wists and truns will keep your eyes glued t the pages.Uncle Sam Westing has died, and no one knows who killed him. In his will, he informs all of Sunset Towers ( which by the way has no towers and faces west) residents to play a game to find out who killed ""Uncle Sam"". Put into pairs, the game begins, with only cut up clues which they have to arrange themselves for a lead. Then they all get caught in a snow-in and are stuck with stalkers, bombers, robbers, and murderers on the loose. In this twisted classic ""who-done-it"" the only people with the clues, are the writer, and you!"
1,This is one of the worst books... if i were you i would stay away,i thought this book was not a good one at all. it was way to confusing and just plain stupid. really if i were you i would definately not read this book ever. if i got to choose and it wasnt for school i would have put it down after the first page. i really do not think this was a good book.
1,A review of Westing Game,"(...)i am in 7th grade.Ijust read The Westing Game by Ellen Raski and i thought it was boring.The setting of the book was Sunset Towers and the most interesting character was Turtle.I felt that the ending of the book was confusing because, it didn't explain it good.I would not recomend this book because, it was really boring."
3,It wasn't a really a good book,This book was not that of a good book because it did not really grab my attention. It didn't have that exciting kind of action. Also it wasn't that of a scary book.
2,Very Confusing,"This book had 16 main characters , 16 different characters . It was very confusing and had a fairly weak plot . But it did get a little less confusing and had an OK ending . Although I don't exacly like Mystery . This book was not worth while , did not keep my attention and I would'nt of read it if I was not required to ."
5,The WESTing Game,"I loved reading this book. I recomend it for people who like to predict the ending. The book starts out slow, but it gets way better twards the middle. If you choose to read this book, I recomend that you hilight, or take notes. It does get sort of confusing. This was my favorite book that I have ever read! And remember, it is not what you have, it is what you don't have."
5,The Westing Game,"The Westing Game is about a rich billionaire who is found dead and leaves his inheritance to 16 heirs. The problem is that to win. The heirs have to play the game. in the will it says Westing's life was taken by one of the heirs. The heirs are split into pairs and are given a set of clues which together give the killer's name. Along the way a lot of exciting things happen to the heirs, like bombings and thefts. The book is packed with excitment and suspense. It is a mystery book for kids wich is why I would recommend this book for ages 8 and up."
3,Awesome book!,This book was very exciting and always kept you on the edge of your seat. It is about a game that Samuel W. Westing made up in his will for the attendants at Sunset Towers to play. It is a great book to read because you get led in so many different ways. It is also a lot of fun to see how Sam Westing thought up this game and the point of it too.
4,"""Boom!"" said Madame Hoo, clasping her hands in delight.","Before reading ""The Westing Game,"" I had yet to witness a decent whodunit book. ""The Westing Game"" has a very complex interweaving plot and many characters to keep you busy. It's a bit short, though, and the ending was a bit abrupt."
5,A fabulous book for all ages!!!,"This book was introduced to me by my girlfriend who I am know forever in debted too! At 20 I read this ""juvenile"" book and couldn't put it down. If you enjoyed Encyclopedia Brown or The Hardy Boy's or Nancy Drew or just like trying to solve puzzles, then this is a book you MUST read. A fabulous book. When I have children they'll read this"
4,Very mysterious but exciting---- a must read!!,"Let's say one your relatives died. To be their heir if they were wealthy would be nice. But not for the heirs at Sunset Towers. You wouldn't have fun either if you were in danger everyday as the suspected murdurer of your relative. If you are not a good mystery solver, you wouldn't survive this situation. Trust me------ you don't want to be there."
2,the Westing Game,"This book is about 16 people gather for the reading of Samuel W. Westing's will. No one knows that they are related to this man. To their surprise, the will turns out to be a contest, challenging the heirs to find out who among them is Westing's murderer. This book is extremely hard to follow and very jumpy. I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys mysterys, trying to figure things out (the context not the mystery), and for people way ahead of their time. I hope this helped!"
1,I wish there were an option for NO STARS!,"Okay, so I first tried to read this book years ago (1989) in elementary school. I was told it was supposed to be such a great book. I found it confusing to read, hard to follow, and had too much useless dialog. Needless to say I never finished the book.Years later (I'm now in my 30's), I attempted to read it again because I thought since I was young, maybe it was too complex for me. Oh my, this book still has the same effect. The book is still boring, still confusing, and still difficult to follow. I found myself skipping through pages of unnecessary dialog between the characters.Sorry, I gave it a second chance and I think it's just an absolutely horrible read."
4,AWESOME book!!!,i had to read this book last year(5th grade) and it was awesome!!!i had a little trouble understanding some parts and what was happening but i still loved it.i think it had a very surprising ending that i loved.i had to read island of the blue dolphins by scott o dell after that and i hated it.i would recommend it to everyone!!
5,Chess,"I think that the Westing Game is an extremely good book and you should definitely at least try to read it.The Westing Game is about these 10 heirs and heiresses and they read their Uncle Sam's will. Then, the mystery starts. One person in the apartment that they all live in is a murderer of their Uncle Sam, one is a thief, one is a bomber, and one person is a mistake. With a surprise beginning and a shocking ending, this book will probably be within your top 10."
5,Great Little Book for Youth.,"This book has entertained young people for years. I used it in my classroom as a class set reading project and recently purchased it for my youngest son to read.It's easy to read, has wonderful characters, and keeps the mind thinking."
3,Worth it,"My daughter insisted that I read ""The Westing Game"". I enjoyed it. I found it a bit boring in the middle but the end is completely worth. I'm glad I read it and I would recommend it to any young reader."
4,A thrilling mystery,"In this thrilling mystery 16 heirs come together for the reading of Samuel Westing's will. The will turns out to be a game for the heirs and the winner gets $200 million! The object of the game is to find out who murdered Sam Westing. The 16 heirs are divided into 8 teams with their own set of clues. But as it says in the will, ""It's what you don't have that counts."" I'll give you some advice though, make sure you write down all the clues that are given for it will be helpful. After many shocking events that occur in this game, the ending will shock you the most! I hope you enjoy reading this book as much as I did."
3,This book started out confusing but it got easier,The book was ok. In the beginning it was confusing. It got easier to understand about 80 pages in. Also there were way to many characters. You would have never guessed who did it. So it was an ok book.
5,I love The Westing Game,"I really liked the Westing Game even though it was really difficult, it was cool.I liked it because it was a good mystery and there were a lot of characters and what they could be, like: the bomber, bookie, burgerler, and mistake. Windy windklopple had so many names, like: Sam Westing, Sandy MacSouthers, Julian R. Eastman and Barney Northrup. That is why I like The Westing Game!..."
3,It kept you geussing and was funny in some parts.,I liked The Westing Game because ... It was funny in some parts and kept you guessing.I hope to read it again soon.I hope you like it because it is a good book.Plus you might learn something from The Westing Game.So I hope you get The Westing Game.
5,I really like this book!,"The reason I liked the Westing Game is because you got to solve the mystery while you were reading it.It also had hard clues, but if you did the right thing with them, you'd find out the answer. It really explained everything well, not just the outcome, but the characters. It also had a logical explaination, and told what happened after the mystery. I think the Westing Game is a great book and will probably read it again."
5,Great Book,"This is a great book. I had a hard time putting it down. It is a little confusing because there are a lot of Charceters, but otherwise it is an action packed book. There are not many dull moments.This book is about a man, Mr. Westing, who gets murdered, but he knows who is going to kill him. He writes a will that is actually a game. There are sixteen heirs that participate in this game. The object of the game is to find the person who killed Westing. Whoever finds the murderer gets all of Westings money!Who will inherit Westing's money? You will have to read the book to find out."
4,Mysterious and Beautifully plotted by Chocolatewillsaveusall,"This is realistic fiction, and some of the best I've read. It's beautifully plotted, and each clue intertwines with the next.16 people enter Sam's world, and their lives will never be the same. There are 16 heirs of Sam, but only one will inherit his massive 1 million dollar inheritance. There are a series of mysterious clues, written on Westing company toilet paper. I ache to tell you the ending, but I won't, because that would be cheating and spoil the entire book. so now, you have to rea I won''t be offended if you ditch this review for it. All I will say is this... Barry Northup has something to hide.By me, this twisted-plot, surprise around every turn, always interesting book gets a 4 star, flashlight-under- the- covers rating."
4,Bailey R`s review,The Westing Game was a puzzling book. It was well plotted so that every page took you through different twists and turns. This story is very captivating and mysterious. You are always eager to find out what happens next. I recommend this unusual book to all mystery lovers.
4,a one line summary.. thats impossible...,"Well, there isn't really a way to describe this book. I had to read this book for my literature class.. At the beginning of The Westing Game, you're gonna think, ""this is boring, and it doesn't make sense."" Nothing is what it seems. Yes, this book is extremely confusing and at times your not gonna wanna read it because its a little frustrating. But you have to play along with the book. Maybe you'll figure out the mystery! Who knows! Overall though, once you finish the 216 page book.. it's great, and it all fits together. I actually recommend this book, its not the type of book I usually read, to be honest, but I definitely would suggest it to a friend."
3,Sam's review,"The Westing Game is a book about a man named Sam Westing. Sam Westing has been found dead on Halloween. A few days later, Sam Westing's 16 heirs and heiresses are gathered for his will reading. It tells them that they are going to play the Westing Game and will be paired off. Each pair receives a few clues to try to figure out the answer to the westing game. Each pair thinks they have the right answer. I like this book because it always kept you guessing. I didn't like it because the beginning was boring."
5,I couldn't put it down,This is one of those books that gets better every time you read it. And that's a lot to say for a mystery. The plot is complicated and it is exceedingly clever overall. I recommend it to adults and children alike and you'll never guess the answer!
4,A good book for kids 12 and up,"This book's setting is in Wisconsin and it was a good book with fun characters, some parts were hard to follow but only a few. I would recommend this book for kids ages 12 and up, the ending was good with surprising twists involving the song ""America the beautiful"" and the directions north, south, east, and west. some characters are more likable than others and you may find some seem suspicious,but in the end are really innocent. sometimes the book moves a bit slowly and it gets better as it goes on, but overall a good book. I am 12 years old."
4,The Westing Game,"The Westing Game is a mystery book that kept my eyes glued to the pages for the most part. It is about a man (Samuel Westing) who ""died"" and is willing to give his estate to one of his 16 heirs. They are put through a game, the Westing Game, to see who will inherit the 20 million dollars!My favorite character, personally, is Turtle Wexleer because of her always being on top of things. She always knows what will happen next. This book was very suspenseful and mysterious.By:R.D., St. Philip School"
5,The BIGGEST boom in books!,"The Westing Game blew my mind! I was in suspense throughout the whole book. It's a great mystery that you yourself can figure out! You think you know the answer but then something else happens and it changes your mind completly. I could read this book over and over agian. You might get confused with all the characters but as the book goes on you begin to understand it better. I love this book and would highly recomend it to all those who like mysteries, suspense, and rapid changes."
3,Quite a dry mystery novel,"I bought this book for my daughter, aged 10, as it was rated for 9-12 age group. I decided to read it myself and found that, although the problem presented in the story is in a form of an intriguing puzzle, it is written in a way which is unlikely to interest most children in that age group. In fact the writing style and humour are quite dry, most of the time simply relating events. It may interest a more mature child but, as far as I was concerned, it also failed to appeal to an adult as the puzzle offered little in a way of challenge."
4,"Kids reveiw on ""The Westing Game""","After Saw Westing's murder, Sam's 16 neices and nephews are gathered in his mansion for a meeting about Sam's death. None of them really new what they were getting themselves into, but what they all did know was that Sam had alot of money, and maby they could be the one to get a peice of it. When the lawyer reads Sam's will, they find out that the murderer of Sam Westing was one of the heirs. They were all split into 8 groups of 2, and each group got a set of clues to help them find out who the murderer was. i would strongly recommend this bok for those of you who like murder mysteries."
4,Great,"Other than at the beginning where alot of characters were introduced I found this to be very easy to read, however even though it was quite simple in my opinion it was still a very good. The plotline was interesting and the characters were well devolped."
4,The Murder,"The Westing Game, by Ellen Raskin, has lots of characters, so it's pretty confusing. It is also about a Murder! Someone killed Sam Westing. The Murder was in Wisconsin right near lake Michigan in the sunset towers. There is a killer that is really hard to find and confusing because there are so many names.There are 16 heirs and heiresses that are supposed to find the murderer of Sam Westing and two of the characters get cut off. One dies and the other one gets thrown in jail. There is also a bomber on the lose that bombs tomato soup cans. They didn't know it was one of there friend who kept bombing the plase. Each of the heirs get a partner and get an envelope of clues and try's to figure out who killed Sam Westing.Everything all works out in the book and the plot pointed to the murderer. I am not exactly sure all of these people were heirs or related to Sam Westing, you'll figure it out. This book is pretty interesting and very confusing but it is still a good book.Chase a 6th grader"
5,A thrilling a suspensfull book!,It was a thrilling and suspensfull mystery. It was very well written. She paired the characters very well when they were trying to figure out the mystery. The end was a little confusing but it was very interisting. I like how she made Sam Westing 'die' that many times and be an heir.I liked how the obituary was planned out that well and said exactly what to Turtle took up for Angela for being the bomber. The different cultures being mixed together in the game.
5,"Good, but confusing...","I read the westing game for the first time last month. I LOVED IT!!! But the first time you read it, it is very confusing! Finally I did get it. If you read it once you will probly wnat to readf it again! Do it! I read it twice in one month I loved it so much! READ IT, READ IT, READ IT!"
4,The Westing Game Review,"By: SundipThis book is an interesting one. Mr. Westing leaves a will and a ver unusual one. This will is a game, which involves winning a lot of money. 16 specfic people are invited to live in the Sunset Towers and all of them are the heirs of Mr. Westing. This 16 people are the players of this game. In this book there is more than one mystery. You have to find out who the bomber, theif, and more are. Turtle is a ""brat"" that allows kicks people in the shin if they pull her braid. She is a very smart girl and everyone thinks that she is the bomber but it turns out that the ""goody-good"" is the bomber. Mr. Westing owned a very big mansion. This mansion was near the Sunset Towers. The mansion was in Westingtown."
4,Darnika's Review,"This book is kinda confusing at the beginning of the book, But once you start reading the book it gets better and better.The book is good to me I love the way Samuel W. Westings plays his game. He make i seems like he dead and they have to find out who his murderer, But really he's not dead. And his lawyer have a meeting with sixteen heirs who stay in the apartment that he owns and the heirs have to play a game to figure out who killed sam Westing.The books makes you wanna solve the mystery yourself, you should read it yourself. I think you'll love it, When i read it and finished it I wanted to read it again but it wouldn't of been good as the first time.I would turtle (i mean tell you who won the game but you wouldn't get as much details as i did!"
1,Good Concept - Terrible Execution - Somewhat Offensive,"The premise of this book was unique, and it had great potential. The writing, however, is atrocious. I don't understand how it received a Newbery. There are almost 20 characters to keep track of, and the author switches POV incessantly, sometimes within a single sentence. She also switches from 1st person to 3rd person erratically and mixes tenses frequently. I would never give this to a child, as I would be afraid they would believe this is what good writing looks like.I tried to make allowances for the publication date, and I'm certainly not one to quibble about political correctness, but even I was offended by the way she handled certain characters' race, occupational potential, and physical and mental handicaps. In the immortal words of Jane Austen, ""Badly done, [Ellen]. Badly done, indeed!"""
3,I think the book was a good book because it was mysterious,"My name is B.C and I will review the book The Westing Game by Ellen Raskin. Some of the events that took place were in the Westing Game mansion where Judge Ford is about to reveal Sandy Mcsouthers as master of the game. Right before that, Sam Westing has a seizure. Smoke comes out from the Westing mansion and all the heirs see the smoke come out. When Chris looks in the house, he sees a person limping. It took place in Westingtown, WI- sunset towers- between October and November. All the heirs of Sam Westing were accused of murder but only one of the heirs did the crime. All the heirs had to play the game in order to find out who the killer was and to win the money. Turtle found out that Sam Westing was Barney Northrup, Sandy Mcsouthers, and Dr. Eastman, so Turtle got the inheritance."
3,It was a good book!,I thought this book was a suspenseful but yet a little boring in the beginning. i do recommend that anyone who is thinking about readind this book ... DO IT ! it really was a great deatailed book!
2,"OKAY, BUT EXTREMELY CONFUSING!","IT WAS OK, BUT i HAD TO READ IT TWICE AND HAVE MY FRIEND EXPLAIN IT BEFORE I GOT IT. IT'S A LITTLE WEIRD HOW MR. WESTING WAS SO MANY DIFFERENT CHARACATERS."
1,Bad,This book was so horrible. I hated it! I can't even see why you published it! I can't believe it. It's disgusting!
1,The Westing Game,(...) i am in 7th grade.I just read The Westing Game by Ellen Raskin and i thought it needed more excitment.The setting of the book was in Michgan and the most interesting charter was Sandy because he was a guy that had a girls name and he had many disguises.I felt the ending of the book was boring becasue nothing happened at the end.I would not recommend this book to anyone because it was to long and boring.
3,"i thought it was wierd but, interesting. {not}","I thought it was a weird and confusing book. I got lost everytime a read it. I didn't really like the book much, it kind ofstunk. I don't like to read."
3,A good book but disappointing end.,"I think The Westing Game is a very well thought out book with many interesting parts. The murderer is very well hidden,and cleverly disguised. To keep up with the book you should take notes and pay very close attention to detail. This book is confusing in some parts but just hang on,and it should make sense in the end. Ellen Raskin is a very smart and thorogh writer who pays close attention to detail. If you enjoy murder mysteries try this book!"
3,It was a confusing book that didn't flow & was boring.,I thought the westing game was an odd story. The characters were vibrant and individuals.(Except for 4). It was a fairly good book. But it didn't flow well. Some people might like it. As far as mystery's go anyway. It was pretty confusing. There was a lot of unneeded information. But the end the book the book sort of pulled it together. The end of the book was the only part that made much sense.
3,"Good, but not THAT good","EVeryone is writing about how wonderful ""The Westing Game"" was, but I wasn't that enthusiastic. In one word, CONFUSING! Too much unnecessary information, if you ask me. At some points I was screaming ""DUH!"" and at others I was saying ""What?"". I suppose this book was OK, but I can think of many more more worthy of the Newberry Honor.P.S. If you don't want to die of boredom, don't read ""Figgs and Phantoms""."
3,Confusing and Boring,The Westing Game was so confusing..and I never found out what happened at the end..which I need to know...
4,A mysterious game,"I thought the Westing Game was interesting because in the book one person found out that some characters were not real, they were costumes that someone was wearing.It was also a little funny because people were being kicked in the shin. Thats all im saying I hope everyone reads this book."
2,It was chezzy but easy,It was a okey book but it could use some better parts. It was to easy to figure out what the clues ment. But it was a good book. i think Iwould read it again
2,The Westing Game,"I am reading the book ""The Westing Game"" and I say that this book absolutely awful. The book has very little details, and the plot is oh, so boring, and I never like this before. The characters names are pointlessly appropriate such as ""Crow"", ""Turtle', and ""Uncle Sam"". The scenery is bad, and I could imagine better places. The ending was also absolutely terrible in all ways ever. I would rather drink tea from a gutter then read this book again.The book starts as a pointless scenario and progress to a field of writing horror. I think the author had a huge writers block, and wrote down what ever she could think of first. I don't now how, but Newbery Award. I would have slapped a biohazard sticker to the book just to so how I really think of this book. My summary is that this book is extremely terrible, and should be destroyed."
5,The westing game,"it was just so exciting. Sam Westing had been murdered, and he chose sixteen heirs. One of them was the murderer. My favorite part was when thee words ber, the, erica, crow were missing from America, the beautiful. Later, it was known the there was no murderer. After all, Sandy McSouthers was the murdere. You should truly read thei book."
2,This book is not worth the time.,"I was very disappointed with the book The Westing Game at the end.The book is about a man named Sam Westing who supposedly died but was really playing games with other characters' minds. Mr.Westing was not really dead. He was hiding and the "" DEAD BODY"" was really made out of clay,and he hid the whole time. That was the main reason I did not like the book! If you don't believe me, see for yourself!"
5,Loved it!,I read this book when I was in the sixth grade and I loved it! I read it at midnight I simply couldn't put it down. I recommend it to anyone who's looking for some fun fiction!
4,Britt's review,"The Westing Game is a puzzling novel that keeps you intrigued to find out who the murderer is. A man died and his inheritants are gathered together to find out who the killer is, and to see what they get from his death. This novel is not only exciting, but it is also a great mystery and an adventure book. It shows a lot of different characters and different sides of the story. If you like adventure and mystery books, that keep you petrified, then I would suggest this story to you."
5,An Excellent Read,"8 pairs of 16 heirs, all ""doomed"" to play the Westing Game. What could be better in a mystery? The Westing Game was, as mentioned, a very good read. It has lots of wacky characters and twists and turns. I would recommend it to anyone who loves a good solve-it-yourself mystery."
4,The Westing Game,"The Westing Game was the coolest mystery book I have ever read. The mystery book includes ""16 heirs"" who were trying to find out which one heir was the one who killed Sam Westing.The book involves several exciting bombings.The book started off slow and kind of boring but when they were talking about more interesting things in the middle and it started to get better and better at the end."
5,Awesome,I loved this book and so did my friends. I was in a book club with them and they all loved turtle.
5,The Westing Game,This was a joy to read. The Westing Game is not only entertaining but a good mystery. Turtle is a brilliant character full of life. I would recommend this to anyone who enjoys their mystery with a side order of humor.
4,"Thrilling, Incredible, Mind Puzzling Mystery","If you are wanting to read a terrific mystery, I reccomend you read the Westing Game. It all starts when a rich man named Sam Westing has died, and he invites his sixteen heirs to his house. He wrote a will stating that he was murdered by one of them. With that he gave every one a partner and several set of clues to find out who his murderer is. The group who finds out the murderer first will inherit his large estate and earn 250 million dollars each. In the end you will realize that everyone will be tricked."
5,My All-Time Favorite,"I first read ""The Westing Game,"" in 6th grade...now, as a 26 year old wife and mother, I find myself rereading it every single year, sometimes more than once. This is the one book I have always wished would be made into a movie...and yet maybe that would ruin some of its magic. I can say with great certainity that Ellen Raskin's masterpiece is my all-time favorite work of fiction!"
3,"It was good, but...",I got overwhelmed and started loosing interest because there were just too many clues to keep track of. I wanted to read a story and have a handful of clues to figure out vs. needing to take down pages of notes.I would be willing to read this again with my kids one day when they are old enough to enjoy it and want to take the extensive notes to try and figure out what is going on.There is a nice variety of characters that did stand out as individuals and the story was engaging.So if you think my complaint is a weak one then this is a book you'll probably enjoy.
5,Why I Liked The Westing Game,"I thought The Westing Game was a suspense thriller. There's money, murder, revenge, explosions,and more.It's so good you won't want to stop reading it. I liked the book because so much was happening with 16 characters doing different things and is so exciting. A man murdered 16 suspects only one murderer and endless possibilities. So many characters and you won't want to put it down. Moving into a new apartment called Sunset Towers on Halloween night a girl is dared to go into a the Westing House . A dead man is found and so 16 people are trying to figure out just who murdered Sam Westing. Four explosions accour. Snowbound with a murderer would be quite scary."
5,This book ROCKS!!!!!!,"If you wanted to read an exciting book, you have the right one!!! This book is both exciting and thrilling. It's about sixteen people who venture into a mystery about samuel W. Westings murder. They get partnered up and each get a set of clues. The only thing is what if your partner is the murderer. If you get lucky, you'll win two- hundred million dollars. It keeps you guessing until the end. Its one of my favorite mysteries. It can be yours too.Read this book. You will love it!"
4,The Westing Game - E.P.S 8th By: Karan Singla,"I read the Westing Game and found it really good. It is filled with suspense and is adventurous. The book is written aroung a game created by Sam Westing the owner of a paper company. He had been ""murdered"" and in his Will he wrote about a game. The rules were that the 16 players would be paired up into 8 groups and would have to figure out the clues to see who had murdered Sam Westing. Most of them live in Sunset Towers. Turtle Wexler figured out that Sam Westing had not been murdered and was still alive. She found where he was living and went there every Saturday to spend time with him. In addition, Sam Westing died and left his fortune to Trutle (T.R.). I don't want to spoil the end for you so read the book and figure out the mystery yourself."
3,Westing Game Book Review,"The Westing Game is a mystery book with few unexpecting events. The 200 million dollar, reward money for solving the murder case caused some interest to the story. I would have never guessed that Sandy would die or that Angela was the bomber. The unexpecting events made the book better to read. However, I would prefer to have a true murder of Sam Westing. The mystery murder aspect of the book made left me guessing. Also, the overwhelming amounts of characters made the novel a little confusing. Therefore, I give the book 3 Stars out of 5 Stars."
2,The westing game,"(...)I just read The Westing Game by Ellen Raskin and I thought the book was exciting. The setting of the book was at Sunset Toweres in MI, and the most interesting character was Turtle because she was the one who cared about what she did with the money and about the game. I felt the ending of the book was slower than the beging because everything about the mystery was solved. I would recommend this book because it is a great book about mysteries."
5,"The Best, by rivergirl94, also reviewed harry potter, finding cassie crazy, etc.","Oh. My. God, if there is one book that captivates you and has a totally solid storyline that is better than Harry Potter, this is it. Like, have you ever read anything that is a total smorgasboard of different topics and totally ROCKS at the same time? Because this is one of those books.So you have Turtle, the feisty and independant 13-year-old who is not only smart, but plays the stock market, you have Ottis Amber, the idiotic delivery boy, you have Sandy, the smart and fresh doorman, and you have all the rest of them, like Angela, Mrs. Wexler, Mr. Hoo, Bertha Crow, Theo, Chris, Doug, and a bunch more. SO, they live in a la-di-da apartment building, and one day, well, trip in the note, it's time for some mishap! And you're plunged into a madcap adventure, including burgulars, bombers, blizzards, false identites, bad-days-in-the-stock-market, and a puzzling mystery. WHO KILLED SAM WESTING?by Meredith Peterson"
5,the westing game- Why you should read it!,I really liked this book because it was a mystery that kept me guessing and at the edge of my seat. The book begins with a new couple that just moved into a new apartment. as the story goes on a bunch of people from the building go to a mansion up on a hill and the Westing game begins.Throughtout the book a series of bombs go off and the main characters try to find out who the bomber or bombers are. The reason I gave this book five stars was because there was a lot of action and suspense. I think if you are a person who likes mystery and adventure you will enjoy this book as much as I did.
5,Had a great time reading it...,"This book was awesome. It really makes you think. I'd say that if anyone had a choice to get this or not, to get it. *DEFINITELY*For some reason, many people have trouble reading this either because it't too complex, or too confusing, or some other kind of excuse. I wouldn't blame them. This book made me think. But I thought it was a fairly simple book.The main characters in this book are trying to find out who the true heir is of Samuel Westing. Turtle and Crow (the main characters) are also trying to figure out who killed Sam Westing, which is the basis for the book.I give a reccomendation at the end of all of my reviews. I RECCOMEND IT TO ANYONE WHO CAN FOLLOW THE STORY. 5 out of 5."
5,"The Westing Game, do you get the riddle","The Westing Game was a very interesting book. It's a story about an eccentric millionaire living in the late twentieth century who knows he is about to be murdered and developes his own mystery plan of finding the heir. The endlass riddles, clues, and solutions in this book made it more challenging to read. In addition, many of the 17 characters change and grow during the story because they have so many interaction with each other. Lonely characters find friends and those who are bored are challenged throughout the game.I would reccommend this book to others. I think this book was defintely more than just a story and the fact that the author was awarded the Newberry Medal proves it."
1,boring book stay away,"My name is jpv I will be reviewing the book Westing Game by Ellen Raskin. This book took place in Westingtown Wisconsin, Sunset Towers,it was around October through November.One of the best parts is when the heirs reveal the clues and they turn out to be America the Beautiful.I also liked when the bombs went off it built som suspense and made the reader want keep readingThe point of the book was all the heirs gathered at the Westing house and one of them was the killer and the heirs had to find out who it wasI thought this book was not interesting enough. I think they needed to add something to make more suspense. It was to boring they just here should of been another bomb or some one dies or something like that"
2,o.k. book,My name is R.S. and I am in the seventh grade.I just read The Westing Game by Ellen Raskin and I thought it was pretty boring. The setting of the book was in MI and the most interesting character was Sandy because he had a good descise. I felt the ending of the book was sad because Sam Westing died. I wouldn't recommend this book because I personaly didn't like it.
1,I think that it was to confusing and amplicated. It stinks!,"THERE WERE TO MANY CHARACTERS. IT HAD AN ODD STORYLINE. I COULD NOT UNDERSTAND THE ENDING, AND WHEN YOU CAN'T UNDERSTAND THE ENDING IT IS KIND OF HARD TO UNDERSTAND THE BOOK."
1,THe Westing Game review,my name is lc and i am in the 7th grade. I just read the Westibng gam by ellen raskin and i thoght that this book had alot of suspence and mystery in it. the setting of the book is in michagain and the most important charoctor is turtle beacuse she won the westing game. i felt that the ending of the book was good beacuse turtle won the money.i wouldnt reguest this book beacuse it was not a very good book.
1,"Wow, that was a waste of time.","My name is J.B. and I will review the book, Westing Game by Ellen Raskin. I liked how Sandy McSouthers was Turtles friend who she never kicked, but I think when she said she kicked Barney Northrup and Sandy had the same bruise in that spot, that gave too much away in the story. Also, there were too many heirs in this book, making some of them not even important in the story very much. I also didn't like how Crow's name was missing from America,America, and she wasn't even the asnwer. This story was too anti-climactic for me, but I won't tell you the answer."
1,I thought the book was very dorky and overrated.,"As a seventh grade student, I thought the book was very dull and I never wanted to read the book in the first place , but I probably read ten chapters out of the book anyway!"
1,The westing Game,"(...) i'm in the 7th grade this book wasn't made for kids in the 7th grade maore for the 9th or, an oldr viewer but the most interesting character was turtle wexler, because she solved the mystery . All in all I would not recamend this book because it was hard."
4,The westing game review,"Those who live in the Westing House are normal people. They enjoy life, but question it to. One day those people discovered something crazy. They saw Mr. Westing dead, rotten, wearing an Abraham Lincoln out fit. He had signs that said that the people who lived there were in his will. The heirs of the will did not just get money right away, but get clues. This is because the will is an investigation to see who killed Mr.Westing. They all search and use the clues as an advantage during this game and in the end they find out who killed him...I rate this book 89 out of 100. The book includes adventure, and mystery. Ellen Raskin made a really good book and I had fun reading it. If you like to read books about mystery and adventure I would recommend this book for you."
4,The Westing Game,I think this is an ok book.Wat is good about this book is that every page is a mistosy.I do not like it because is confuse.
2,The Westing Game,"The Westing Game is about Sam Westing and his 16 ""heirs."" Sam Westing was dead, but on his will it had a game. In this game the ""heirs"" are given clues to win. A young girl named Turtle Wexler is determined to inherit Sam Westing's fortune. But also in Sam's will he told that one of the ""heirs"" killed him. So everone is trying to win while trying to figure out who the killer is.This book is for kids of all ages. I didn't think the book was great, but not bad. If you like mystery books I recommend this to you. Overall it's an ok book. I gave The Westing Game two stars out of 5."
4,The Westing Game,"It was required summer reading from my school, and it was a good book, but it started slow."
3,The confusing game,"This book is very confusing. I thought this would be a great book to read, but no. The book is confusing and strange. Their is so many info to remember in the stroy. The book gtes boring each time. But it's ok for a mystery guy.John"
5,Any and every Kid should read this mystery!,"This is indeed a very crafty novel that is suited for any kid. The details, the plot, the interesting characters combine and make something well worth anyone's time. I read it 4 years ago and still remeber every clue given Ellen Raskin gives to you. Time and Time again will I recomend this to a young adult. Don't go see the movie because it is not nearly as good, and will waist your time. This book is absolutely fantastic"
5,My Favorite Book,"I read this book when I was 8- and I'm still reading it over and over. The plot is excellent. If this book doesn't hook you I don't think ANY book can. However, people always have their own opinions, but everyone I know has read this book and gave it 5 STARZ. My 5th grade teacher, Ms. Suarez, read this book to our class. And although I'd read it 4 times before... I love hearing it over and over again. And even though my reading level (tested) is 13+ (grade level-wise), I still like reading this. And I'll LOVE IT FOREVER."
4,If you like Mysteries this is the Book to Read!,"The Westing Game is GREAT book. A WONDERFUL mystery for everybody to read. The Westing Game is about sixteen characters who all recently moved into Sunset Towers. All the characters are GREAT, but my favorite was Turtle(a.k.a.) Alice.Turtle is stubborn but I still like her.The boowas overall a great book."
5,The best newberry ever.,"If you did not like this book you don't know what your talking about. It was fun to play along, and try to figure who did it but every time you think you have it the book tales a violent turn."
4,The Great Game- E.P.S,"The Westing Game, by Ellen Raskin is great adventurous and suspense story making the reader keep on reading more. It is a game which was created by Sam Westing. Now his secret identity Barney Northrup has invited the heirs to Sunset Tower and the reading of Will. They were read the object of the game to find the murderer. There were given rules and paired up into 8 groups. Now their job was to unscramble the clues and find the suspect which is one of the heirs. Throughout the story, with all the trouble they figure out what has happened and who had killed Sam Westing. The solution was Sam Westing was Sandy McSouthers part of the heirs. He had died due to a heart attack. Finally, the story ends with Turtle, a heir who found the real Sam Westing. All the heirs lived happily ever after. My opinion on this book is that it is one of the best books I have read. It is thrilling to read and is very informational. I enjoyed and recommend it to other readers.~Krunal Bodalia~"
3,"An ok, kind of good, not really book","Hi. My name is JM and I will review the book Westing Game by Ellen Raskin. One of my favorite parts in the book is when Turtle enters the Westing house and sees the dead body of Sam Westing. Another one of my favorite parts is when the 16 hiers find who the so called murderer is. The book takes place in Westingtown,WI in or near an apartment called the Sunset Towers during the monthes of October through December. During this time 16 unlikely hiers have to find out who killed Sam Westing to inhierit his money. I'm not going to tell you the answer so you are just going to have to read book yourself."
3,It was a fairly good book.,"My name is JB and I will review the book Westing Game by Ellen Raskin.The setting was in Westing town, WI in Sunset Towers. It took place in October and November.All of the heirs were accused of killing Sam Westing. The heirs have to play a game to win the inheritance.In the Westing Mansion, Judge Ford is about to reveal Sam Wesring as Master of the game. When they were revealing the clues and the missing letters spelt Bertha Erica Crow."
5,A mind-bending puzzle. Funny,"The Westing Game is a great book, winner of the Newberry Medal. Sam Westing is dead and it is up to 16 heirs to find out who murdered him. He was a master at chest and is believed to have many identities. Who really murdered him?Nobody is what you expect them to be, and it's up to you to find out who everybody is.I really enjoyed reading The Westing Game. The suspense is great. My teacher made our class take notes along the way, which I found to be very helpful in solving the mystery. Each pair is given a set of clues to win the game and $10,000. Who will win? You won't know till you read this book."
5,Sam Westing,"The Westing Game by Ellen Raskin is a book about 16 heirs and heiresses trying to figure out who murdered Sam Westing. Whoever figured out the murder wins $200,000,000.00. Sam Westing was a great chess player who owned a paper company.There were 16 unrelated people who were trying to figure out the murder. Sam Westing always sacrificed his queen when he played chess; in this case he sacrificed his old wife, Berthe Erica Crow. The will was very confusing to the heirs and heiresses, they didn't figure out the murder for two months.If you like puzzles or challenges then I would suggest this book for you because it leaves you confused. So now the main question is.....Who did it?(...)"
4,The Westing Game,"The Westing Game is a book where Sam Westing writes clues on his will for a game. The game's object is for the 16 hiers to find out which among them murdered Sam Westing. The winner gets $200,000,000.00 in cold hard cash.It was an exciting mystery that makes the reader want to turn the page again and again. The reader can read along with the mystery and become a detective to find out who it is before it is revealed in the end.I would recommend this to people who love books and to people who THINK reading is boring. It would be fun to read it while you have a notebook so you can write down the suspects and what makes them a suspect and then cross them off when you find proof that they did not do it, you can write and figure out the clues."
4,Excellent Mystery,"A great mystery to test your thinking. Just when you think you've got it, you find yourself wrong. I would have given it 5 stars, but to me, there were too many characters and it would sometimes get very confusing trying to remember who was who. My tip would be to write down all the characters when you meet them and a little description to follow. That way you don't have to reread over everything. But besides from that, I loved the book and would recomend it to anyone, even kids older than 12 just for a fun, easy book."
4,Surpise Ending!?,"The book, The Westing Game, is a very nice and realistic book for kids that want to read about fun mysteries. It started out where the old man, Sam Westing, dies. Then after that the 16 "" nieces and nephews"" or the ""heirs"" were gathered up to find out what was going on. After the judge talks to them they find out they will be playing a game that Sam Westing had made up. The game is a lot harder than what they had thought. First, they started out with a $10,000 check to start the game. The two teammates had to sign the check before it could be cashed in. Whoever finds out who ""murdered"" Sam Westing would win $200 million. You will be surprised about the ending, so please read the book!"
1,THIS BOOK SUCKS MAJORLY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"The Westing game. What can I say about this besides the factthat I hated this book. My English teacher made my class read this,and discuss it. First of all I think that the characters in this bookare the shallowest, and most boring characters I have ever encounteredin a book,(espically Madame Hoo, and Mr. Hoo). I also thought thestory was to much of a fantasy, when it would have been alot better ifit were more realistic.Do NOT buy this book. Well that is notunless you want a book with a shallow story line, and even shallowercharacters. Buy..anything for that matter just don't waste your moneyon this item..."
1,I think it stinks,"My name is AF and I will review the book The Westing Game by Ellen Raskin. I hated when you found out Sam Westing was four people. It was so confusing, I didnt get it for a while. When you found out Sandy was Sam and all the heirs didn't know. It took place in the Westing house but mostly in the Sun Set Towers. All the heirs of Sam Westing were accused of murder. The heirs played the game to get his inheritance. The clues all pointed to Crow as the killer."
1,Crap...crap...and more crap,"This book really sucks. There is no ""murder"", there is no ""killer"" there is no anything. This book is written for small children who are not mature enough to handel a real muder mystery novel in which someone ACTUALLY dies.The only forms of violence at all in this book is when stupid Turtle kicks somebody and a present explodes....thats it. I'm not saying that the book has to be super gory and violent but if its a ""murder"" mystery then there kind of needs to be a murder not some stupid little contest.The ending is sooooooo anti-climactic that its sad, you read this whole book and you think that your going to find out who murdered Mr. Westing but as it turns out....there is no murderer, Mr. Westing is actually alive he's the bellhop and some other guy in ""disguise"" ohhh how scary a disguise... (there, I just saved you time and money).Please, save yourself the money and buy a better detective novel, like Sherlock Holmes etc. This book sucks."
2,The book was... disappointing,"The book called ""The Westing Game"" was like all theother books that have a mysterious murderer. In almaost every mysterybook that i have read there is always a murderer that is on the loose. Although the book's ending caught me off gaurd i still wouldn't recamend it to a person who is looking for something different that you dont normaly see in books now-a-days. I do like the ending because it had a surprise to it, i admit that i would have never guessed that it would end up like it did."
2,westing game really stunk alot. It had to many characters.,There were way to many charaters and the book was really confussing. The story line was really messed up. And the only way I could figure out who did what was because I had read it before.
3,Perhaps I was a bit too old...,"The storyline started off very disjointed and choppy, but the characters eventually came together. And though the plot was beyond far-fetched, and the characters somewhat implausible, it was a fun read. I would say it would definitely appeal to a younger audience more, based on the writing style, but it was still decent to read as an adult. Not as in depth or technically correct as mysteries I usually read, but quicker and fluffier."
4,A Really Goood Boook!!!!!!!!,I liked The Westing Game because it really put you on the edge of your seat it was a really good book I recommend it. My favaroite character was Syndell Pulaski because she was interesting and you can never know what she will do next. I also liked Angela alot. Who dun it you have to read it to find out!
5,It makes you want to keep on reading,"The Westing game is an awsome book. Sixteen people are gathered into the Westing house for a reading of Sam Westings will. It turns out to be a contest, challenging thenm to find out who the is. You and one other person hold the clues. Mabye you can figure it out before they can."
4,The Westing Game was a pretty good book.,"I liked this book because it made me want to keep reading. One of my favorite type of books are mysteries, so I got right into it. This book also made me want to keep reading because I wanted to find out who the winner is and who the answer is. Thats why I think this book is good."
4,Was it a murder,"Imagine that you are an heir to Sam Westing. Then you would know how it felt to try to figure who killed him. The book is The Westing Game by Ellen Raskin. In this book the reader must figure out who killed Sam Westing. He was a very wealthy man, who loved to play chess.Sam Westing (supposedly) was murdered in his home after his tenants moved in to Sunset Towers. (Sunset Towers is a strange kind of place which faces east while the sun rises in the in the west.) One day somebody found him dead. Later all of his heirs came to hear his will. To their surprise it was a game to figure out who killed him.As you get closer to the end of the book you start to wonder, did Sam Westing actually get murdered, did he do something that he shouldn't have, or did he die of old age? There is only one way to find out. Read The Westing Game.Meghan, a sixth grader"
5,"An amazing blend of mystery, suspense, and unique characters","I first read this book in 2nd grade in '92, and since then it has been one of my favorites. The exquisite character development allows someone that everyone can relate to, plus a storyline with so many twists and turns, and a surprising ending that no one can predict the culprit."
5,The Westing Game...a great book!,This book is great! You can get all the clues and figure it out yourself. It's like you are a detective. I highly recommend it.
5,A Delight,"This books is one of the best i have read in a long time. It was enjoyable from the beginning to the end. It was a book that everyone can enjoy, even if you're 6 to age 106. I thought that the jokes nad puns were delightful, and the names were great! It was a made-for-TV movie in 1997, an dI have heard rumors that it is coming out on video soon! I can't wait! Read this book - you'll love it!"
4,The Best Mystery of Its Time,"The Westing game gives the reader all they need. It has comedy, adventure, suspense, and mystery. Ellen Raskin did a wonderful job keeping the audience guessing. Sam Westing, a very rich billionare, who founded Westingtown, has been found dead in his home. Sixteen people gather for the reading of his will. In his will, it stated that he was murdered, and the murderer was one of them!"
4,A good book for mystery book readers.,"The Westing Game by Ellen Raskin is a wonderful mystery that makes you think about one thing but really does'nt help you in the longrun, which makes it even more exciting to the reader. The book is about 16 people that move to an apartment complex called Sunset Towers. Everything is normal until a girl named Turtle Wexlergoes into the Westing Mansion and finds the dead corpse of Sam Westing. now it is nothing like normal, all of the people that live in Sunset Towers are all now related to Sam Westing. They are all entitled to his $200 million dollars from his will, but they have to play and win the Westing Game."
4,You never know whats going to happen.,"I have read The westing Game, and it's a very good book. 5 or 6 pages into the story, you don't want to stop. It's a page turning mystery with bombs, people, and other things. You are the only one who knows all of the clues and the murderer may not be the person who it seems.If you are into short, good mysteries that don't cost that much to buy, this is the book for the averege reader.To end this summary, I say this book is for everyone who likes books and likes to read."
4,"The book is very suspenseful,all of the time!","The Westing Game book is a Very good book,better than most,justabout all! Greed takes all the heirs, I mean 200 million baby. Theresa bookie,a bomber, a theif, and a no-good killer! Most of the heirs are suprised to be related to Sam Westing though. And when they get paired, they dont like it! I wondered what pair of heirs will get the cash in a flash! I know, but if you haven't read it, read it and figure out, it will be fun! Ellen Raskin is good at mystories! I've seen the movie and read the book, both fun!"
4,This book is confusing but very interesting.,As a seventh grade student this book has a good plot and kept me on my toes the hole time.My class used this book for a project and I thought it was a good project.I thought the ending was exciting.
4,An ok book but very confusing!,"It was an ok book but I couldn't understand it that much, so therefor it was very confusing for me.I wanted to know what was going to happen next and so that is what made it interesting, but I couldn't remember who did what and why,and that is what made it confusing.Other than that it was a pretty good book."
4,"A Book of ""Millions""",I definitely recommend this book to anyone who loves a good mystery. At night I would read for hours because I couldn't put this book down. The author uses such good imagery that you think that you are actually in the story. Throughout the story there were many parts that held my interest like when I discovered that Mr. Westing was one of the heirs. The Westing Game is by far one of the best books I have read.
4,Very Interesting !!,"The Westing Game is a great book. There are a few boring parts to this book, also. Not to give away the ending, but the whole story is a lie. That is one of the many interesting parts to this book. There is much action, suspense, and a lot of fun!! I would recommend this book to teens and pre-teens because I don't think that 9 or 8 year olds would understand this book. Overall, though I give it four stars.-Apurv Gandhi"
5,A fast-paced and fun whodunnit for kids and adults,"I had read this Newbery winner back in 4th grade, and while I remember absolutely loving it, I could barely recall the plot! I'm so glad I decided to reread this one. It is an excellent story, full of intrigue, fun, and wonderful plot twists. I can imagine 4th graders on up reading this mystery, and trying to solve the 'whodunnit' right along with the rest of the characters. The book, published in 1978, only dates itself in one place (by referring to a girl with cognitive disabilities as a ""Mongoloid""--yeesh). But otherwise, this was a riveting mystery, and well-worth a reread! I would recommend ""The Westing Game"" for children ages 9 and up, who love trying to solve a good mystery!"
3,The Westing Game,This book takes a little bit of getting in it really like it . It is a great book I think you should read it
5,one of the best books ever,"i loved this book so much. It was full of suspense, jokes, thrill and excitement. though it was confusing in the beginning there is a lot of fun. this book makes you want to read and never stop. it is a good book to make someone interested in reading"
5,Real page turner,"I am a teacher looking for a book to read with my class next year. This is the book! It is a good mystery that kept my interest throughout the entire book. It was a challenge to keep all of the characters straight, but it was a good challenge. I highly recommend this to anyone looking for a well written mystery."
5,The Westing Game,"If you are looking for a book that you will not be able to put down, then this is the book for you. The Westing Game is about 16 people who are invited to a strange will reading of the rich Samuel Westing. The will reading turns out to be instructions for a game, where the heirs are paried up and given 10,000 dollars and a set of clues. The first pair to figure out the game become millionaires. The story is fabulous and you will love the cast of characters. I would give this book five stars."
1,"Second Rate Images, Restrictive Licensing","All of this series are badly drawn, many are black and white, and none are royalty free."
5,Solid phone,"This is a well designed, solid and well built phone. I love it despite all the negative points discussed in previous reviews."
1,"Great phone, unless....","You want to call someone. I was prepared to love this phone from the start. Almost everything about it was exactly what I was looking for save one thing, reception. I've owned about ten different Nokia phones over the years and the 8801 was by far the worst when it comes to the cell phone's most basic function. My trusty Nokia 6610 comfortably showed four bars and excellent reception of the Tmobile GSM system. A swap of SIM cards yielded a fluttering one bar on the 8801 at best. If you're considering this phone, make certain you have strong reception in your area. You'll need it."
5,Great phone,"So far, so good w/ the Nokia 8801. Very elegant design. The trade-off: it is a bit heavy.Good reception, intuitive user interface, easy-to-use. Highly recommended."
1,2 of these broke on me within a month,"This fone first off when you flip up you have 0 volume control so it's very hard to hear and you wind up breakin the slider action (nice to see the ball berrings fly out). Luckally that happened to the first one I had within 30 days, the second one I got by return lassted slightly longer and now has a dead screen."
2,Not that good,"i bought this crap returned it and bought a w810 from sony ericsson, do the same, or better yet dont even try it buy the w810 from the getgo."
2,Even for $400 it is too expensive,"It looks good, have too many issues not worth the price point. When it was $900 it was a bad purchase at >$400 still a bad choice. If this phone goes down to $100 I might buy it as a pretty paper weight."
3,Beautiful but not practical,"If you would like buy a phone so people can tell you how good it looks, then this is the phone for you. If not, this is not a good choice. The battery life terrible and you can hardly hear a thing when you are talking in an environment where there is even a minimal amount of noise. For its price you can get a much better phone."
4,Columbia hikers - great hiker,Nice hiker. Was expecting all eyelets style but got ones with the hook at top. Previous ones i owned had all eyelets but these do the trick and I'm happy i got.
4,Love these boots,"I have had these boots for a couple months now, and I am very happy with them. I bought them to replace the exact same make and model because I was very happy with the previous pair. I got six years of use out of the old pair, wearing them about three days a week, before they started to show wear. I still use the old pair for working in the yard. These fit right, are well made, and keep my feet dry."
3,Won't keep your feet dry.,Nice boots and very comfortable but they do not keep my feet dry at all. Maybe it's just the pair I have but they are not waterproof by any stretch.
1,Dangerous! Lacing hooks nearly killed me on ladder!,"Nice comfortable shoes but I have had trouble with the lacing hooks catching on things. Once I had one catch on the side of a ladder I was coming down (TALL ladder) and nearly got killed or at least hurt. Replace the hooks with a better system and they'd be a great shoe, as is I consider them dangerous."
1,Wrong shoe labeling,"I ordered size 11 because the previous pair of these exact same shoes I bought states on the inside label they are size USA-11, UK9, EUR 42, CM27.5. What I received on this order's i/s label states USA-11,UK 10, EUR 44,CM 29. The new pair I received are much larger than my previous pair. Obviously there is something wrong with Columbia's labeling program. Size 11 should be size 11 every time!!!I liked my previous shoes but won't buy Columbia again because I can't be confident of what I will get.Dennis Collins"
5,Awesome speed!,"I got this 80X SD Card for my Canon SD450, and it's working great. I researched a lot about high speed SD cards and found this the best value for money. Also, I compromised with a 1 GB card because I think it's quite enough.I have used several cameras (using SD, XD cards or sony's memory stick), and each time I have been transferring the pics there is a very long pause. NOT anymore! On a USB 2.0, transferring the first 150 pictures (each 2+ MB) from my camera to my computer took less than a minute.For those of you who don't know 80X equals 80 X 150KB = about 12 MB per second speed. I am sure faster cards will give better performance but I don't think you need anything faster than this for the money you pay. Also, shooting using the burst mode (taking 15 pictures in less than 8-10 secs) was a breeze. I researched a lot for these cards and I think this is a good deal. I bought it from one of the outside vendors at Amazon (thememstore) and they gave me good service for a good price."
5,Fast and no failures,I got the card for my Canon 620a (7 meg) and it works great. There is no lag in transfer from the camera to the card. 4 months of use and no failures yet.
3,Pelican Component Cables,"The video out from these component cables works perfectly but don't buy this if you need the optical out because the optical out DOES NOT work, numerous people have had this problem so it is not an isolated problem."
5,THIS IS SO AMAZING CABLE !!!!! BEST BEST BEST!!!!,"THIS IS A BEST XBOX 360 CABLE EVER!!! UR MUST THINKING ""this is made of weird company and its black"" ITS NOT BLACK!!! and its made of microsoft!!!!! BELIEVE ME ... This cable can support up to 1080p or 1080i or 720p. Its just like hdmi, it supports 1080p. DO NOT BUY ONE ON DOES $40 OR $50 xbox 360 hd component cable. Also this shipped super fast, and it was BRAND NEW!! there were no any scratches and there was no difference between microsft hd component cable that I bought on gamestop. If u want to buy hd cable for xbox 360, U MUST BUY THIS!!!!"
2,Loose fit on 360 slim,"Connector fits loosely in my 360 slim, causing intermittent connectivity if moved slightly.Found a much better cable at Newegg made by Belkin, however it has been removed from the site.For my 360-S I was using the component cable included with my 360 elite. When I sold my 360 elite I needed a replacement component cable so I ordered this. I never had issue using the OEM cable from my elite on my 360-S, but this cable was giving me no picture so I would have to wiggle it left and right until the picture came up and then make sure I did not move or even shake my 360 and tv stand (after turning them to access the cable for trouble shooting. The Belkin cable I found at Newegg fits firmly into the 360-S."
1,Sub Par Cable,"When I attempted to use this product, it did not work. I had green lines go across my TV, colors changed, and when changing screens, there was bleed thru. I checked and rechecked all the cables to make sure they were tight."
4,Pretty Good,"This product came at the estimated delivery, and works like a charm. It's kinda weird Microsoft didn't include this when I bought my Xbox. Well, my only complaint is the picture makes it appear that the cord is black, therefore matching my black Xbox. The cord is grey, like the old Xbox cords. Not a giant deal, but it looks a little weird. Anyway, now that I have high definition I am very satisfied."
2,Output quality,"I was able to view the output placed on my plasma television, but there were lines running across the image. I would unplug the cable and replug it and it would flicker, move up the screen, and then go back to where it was. Might just be this cable, but I guess that's what I get for paying for something this cheap. I plan to return this."
5,Why pay more,wanted an extra cable so I only had to move the 360 system from room to room . money well spent in my opinion.
2,xbox av cable,"cheap, get what you paid for. I connected the av cable and when i moved the tv, the prong on one of the cable broke. I cant hear the game i play and the prong is stuck in my tv."
2,Cheaply made replacement cable,"Based on the product description, I was expecting to get the same Microsoft cable that came with the XBox originally, but this is not the same cable. It feels like cheap plastic, and when I hooked it up I could instantly see ghosting in the image that wasn't there when connected with a higher quality cable.I wouldn't recommend buying this unless you don't care much about the image quality and build quality of the cables."
5,I can think of nothing to say except I love it!,I just went and bought it and find myself craving more. This from a long time anime adict who usually is a lot more reserved. This is a great anime! I heartilly recommend it to any anime fan!
3,Okay....but...,"This Anime is different from other Animes, in that I can't see a plot in it. Or maybe that is why it is like other Animes. The drawing techniques are great, but every thing else seems to be lacking. When compared to Neon Genesis, it has nearly no plot at all. I felt that 3 stars should do it right, because it was interesting to watch, and funny at times, but that is about it."
5,Delighted,Was a gift along with a telescope for our 9 year old granddaughter. She was delighted and still reads the book and uses her telescope.
3,the sky is the limit.,the sky is the limit and because it is infinite there is no limit. i hope my child enjoys it with my father.
5,my son loves it,"my son was very excited to get this book. it came with 2 pages of stickers and also a wheel that helps you figure out what stars are in the sky. the book is a little advanced for my son (he is in 1st grade) not because the book is difficult to understand but because it is a lot of reading and he would rather me do it so he can just look at the pictures, there are plenty of pictures to look at."
5,Amazing book,I bought this book for my 14 y.old brother. It was a great book.It is a fun and nice book for children.
5,What a book!,"What a wonderful book - the illustrations, displays are all inspiring. This will be a gift for my grandson for Christmas along with a telescope and in using this book he will enjoy his experiences all the more."
3,Not for kids,"In todays world of tight budgets, to find the publications you want for specific topics at a reasonable price, is fantastic. Everything was received as specified, in very good condition, and in a timely fashion.This really was not for my 9 year old grandson, although informative. It was really from what I recall over his head."
5,Great family gift,Bought this for my hubby to use when he and our daughters look through his telescope. They all love it!
5,High-quality book,Book was received in excellent condition. We have not had a chance to enjoy the book because of the busy holiday season. Looking forward to it.
5,Fabulous for my son,"Love this book. It is so informative yet so easy to understand for a beginning astronomer! Great star constellation guide. We purchased a telescope, too, and the book really helps us to learn to use that. I would recommend this to any child learning about astronomy and if you have a Cub Scout getting their astronomy belt loop or pin, it is a MUST. Awesome!"
4,excellent gift,I purchased this book as a gift for my 9 year old nephew. He absolutely loved it! He enjoys reading the book with his mom and loves the fact that it came with the glo-in-the-dark stars.
4,A Child's Introduction to the Night Sky,"Excellent book. I purchased this as a thank you gift for my ring bearer, who is fascinated with the stars. I looked through the book and found it to be quite interesting."
1,VERY out of date,I wish I had noticed the date on this book. I ordered by description and had to come back and find something new. Now I look for the date 1st.
2,Having an agenda,"The agenda of this film is perfectly clear: feminism and anti-clericalism. There is only one other such film in the Morse collection, and it too is a stinker. The plot in this case is highly complex and implausible. That's okay, but the female script writer should not have been quite so blatant with her propaganda. In short, this film is not worthy of the otherwise first class Morse series."
1,Did NOT work,I was very disappointed when I received this toy and it did not work. I placed new batteries in the elmo and it worked for about an hour and then stopped working again. I returned the product and was then notified that they were no longer available so now I am elmo-less.
3,Sing N' Hum Elmo,"I ordered this Elmo for my son who loves pacifers as well as Elmo. It's a cute toy that sings w/o the pacifer and hums when it is in his mouth. The pacifer is held in by a magnet. After the first few times, I had to help put the pacifier in b/c it kept slipping out of Elmo's mouth. It's now at the point where I have to hold it in his mouth for Elmo to hum the song. It's a cute toy but a little disappointed on how easily the pacifier comes out of Elmo's mouth.My son loves it and doesn't notice. Just a mom thing."
3,Sing 'n Hum Elmo,"Love this baby Elmo. It is adorable and my granddaughter loves it too. It does frustrates her since the pacifier is too hard for her to put it in Elmo's mouth. It is hard for too. The manufacturer should correct this flaw. That is the only problem I have had with this toy; otherwise, we love it."
2,SING 'N HUM ELMO IS A BIG HO-HUM,"I bought this for my 2 year old granddaughter's birthday this month. Elmo sings and when you pop his binky in he hums the song instead. I think the product would have been better if Elmo has made continual sucking sounds while the binky was in his mouth and tried to say different things that sounded garbled until you took the binky out. All in all, my granddaughter and I were both not impressed and it did not hold her interest."
3,Too hard for little hands.,"It is very difficult for a toddler to put the pacifier in Elmo's mouth so he will hum. Cute toy, but an adult needs to manipulate it."
5,Very good toy!,"This toy is wonderful, however I would not recommend that you purchase it for your 1 year old as they are still putting things in their mouth. The pacifer is attached very well but would recommend the ages of 18 months to 2 years and older. The toy is cute and like all other sesame street elmo's I really ""L O V E"" them. I've watched my 1 year old niece play with this toy and she absolutely loves it. We all love E L M O!"
3,Cute but not as described,"My son does loves this elmo. He sings and hums, but he does not light up as the description says. That was kind of disappointing."
3,Sing and Sometimes Hum Elmo,"I just bought this for my daughter's 2nd birthday. Don't waste your money. It is cute but the pacifier does not dtay in the mouth, ever. I have to have mine in the exact right position for it to accept the pacifier and hum and then it could take me 50 more tries to get it to do it again. This drives my 2 year old crazy to tears. It's awful. If I knew this Elmo was going to cause so much Stress, I would have bought the more expensive one."
3,Pacifier does not stay in Elmo's mouth,"I bought this for my 1 year old son for Christmas. It's really cute and he likes it. The only thing I don't like about the toy, is that the pacifier does not stay in Elmo's mouth. So, that was a disappointment. Other than that I would recommend this toy.JamieEvansville, IN"
2,Damaged,This product is cheap in price but unfortunately in quality too. Certain areas on the frame were bent and thus leaving a ripple and damage to the finish. Had the same problem with another fixture I ordered. The light rods are also all off and need to be bent to be in line with each other. These products are just to hard to order online because damage can occur during shipping and its hard to know how thick or damage resistant the fixture is. The material they are made of cannot hold up to much pressure thus it distorts easy. Next time I'll go to a store to purchase such fixtures.
3,Shorter than I expected,Revered as one of the best Joker comic books in the Batman series I was surprised by how short it was. I love Alan Moore's work (Swamp Thing & The Watchman) but I was a little disappointed with the storyline & feel as if this novel is a little overrated.
4,An essential Batman VS The Joker story,"The art in BTKJ is the shining point for me personally, but the story comes in second by a hair.I have always heard about TKJ from reviews in the comic book world, and just recently read it.When I began reading it, a bit of a ways into it I wasnt sure how to process it.This problem doesnt happen very often when Im reading a book.The joker has in recent years puzzled me more and more, hes a character I cant wrap my head around for obvious reasons, but as we all know thats the beauty of the character.TKJ was written by the great Alan Moore and finely illustrated by Brian Bolland and originaly colored by John Higgins.In the new deluxe edition however Bolland has now recolored the whole book and looks much more clear and sharp compared to the original.For me as of now TKJ is a fine read and should be read by any comic book fan."
5,Short and to the point,"As I'm sure it has been said many times before about this book, it truly outlines the relationship between Batman and the Joker. I'm sure that one day their relationship will be regarded as an ancient rivalry of folklore."
4,Moore just nails the Joker.,"I've found that sometimes writers have a hard time getting a grip on writing the Joker as a character. Alan Moore has no problem with that! His portrayal of Batman and Commissioner Gordon are also right on. This is the story that led to Barbara Gordon (the daughter, not the mother) becoming Oracle. Bravo to Mr. Moore for such a captivating and absorbing story!"
4,Awesome Comic.,I've Always Loved Batman And Was To Scared To Get into the comics not knowing where to start. well after year one i thought it would be nice to grab a copy of this one. its very enjoyable and loved the art. good plot. good dialouge. this is a must buy.
4,Good Read,"This was a good read, but part of me wished for a less ambiguous ending! Overall, the story is compelling as an examination of morality in our society, but I believe Moore's treatment of Batman lacked development. I would definitely recommend this graphic novel to other Batman fans, but warn that it is Joker's story not Batman's."
5,Killing Joke,"I'm not much on graphic novels, but I loved this one. It was recommended to me by my son, who is a bigger bat fan than I. The story and artwork are top notch."
2,Alan Moore needed a paycheck,"Alan Moore is probably the best comic book writer of all time. But while he puts real work into his major projects, sometimes he just throws things out there for a paycheck. This book falls into the latter category. Unlike Frank Miller, who both studied and redefined Batman and the Joker, Moore clearly didn't do his homework here. Both of them are completely out of character with the rest of the series. Perhaps the worst part of the writing is the portrayal of the Joker's ""insanity."" Sure, he explains how he went insane. But his explanation is perfectly sane. In fact, everything the Joker does in this book is either sane or simply random (and the random acts are carried out just for the sake of doing something randomly: the Joker is trying to prove his insanity). Save your money and get Dark Knight Returns or Batman: Year One instead."
5,Short but sweet,"I really enjoyed The Killing Joke. The story and artwork are really well done, but the thing that struck me most about this comic is the color work by John Higgins. I love all the bright colors like pink, purple, yellow and green used in almost every panel (except for the flashbacks). It gives it an almost trippy and psychedelic feel that fits the story perfectly and that's what really makes this comic for me. If you are like me and are wanting to collect only the best Batman stories, like The Dark Knight Returns, Year One, The Long Halloween, Dark Victory, etc., then this is definitely one to add to your collection."
5,The Killing Joke review,"I read this it's bloody brilliant. A small bit short as it was only intended to be a one-shot. This was typical Alan Moore and I loved it. The fictional biography of the joker everyone's favorite bad guy, the journey ito him mind as he goes insane with a little ambiguity left at the end. Also this has some ingenious private jokes towards the Dark Knight which makes it even better. Simply a classic."
4,"Let's keep this short - this is just a great, short read","I am a comic book nerd and whenever people give me that smug look this is the comic I lend them. It takes about thirty minutes to read and the story is grown up enough to make people realize that comics aren't for kids, they're just about story telling. This is fast paced and so emotional; only Moore could create a story that actually has you feeling sorry for a bad guy. Read this book!"
1,Save your money.,"This tome is for Alan Moore completists only. This certainly pales in comparison to "" V for Vendetta"", "" From Hell"" and "" The Watchmen"". There isn't much in the way of character development, though Moore did take the liberty of providing an interesting origin for the Joker. The interplay between Batman and the Joker is rushed and not well thought out. Certainly one of the worst works of Alan Moore. If you are interested in Batman look towards Arkham Asylum and The Dark Knight Returns. The ""Killing Joke"" is lame."
3,This is an ok story but it isnt worth a five,"First off I love the stroy it just seems like it was lacking something. I dont like it when a story makes me feel that way because then there is almost no reason in reading again. That is just my personal view. I appreciate the joker being brutal but like I said, there was something missing. I guess I had certain expectations seeing as so many people swear by this story. It was good it isnt great. Plus, when I get my books, I want them to be in awesome condition. There are many little flaws on the slip cover and on the actual hard cover, there are pencile marks!!! Pencile marks!! What, did thet use it as a clip board before they shipped it??? WTF?!?! I dont live with mommy and daddy and I work for my money so when you say its new thats how I expect to get it. When I bought this book I also purchaced the Weapon X story arch and that book to was damaged when I was told that it was new. I dont know just not a good experience in general.... :("
2,"That's not funny, Batman.","I get it. This book is a classic, role re-defining story. I love Barbara Gordon as the Oracle, so I do have a sort of appreciation of this book. But I don't understand Batman's complacency and compassion toward the Joker. It seems so out of character. And maybe its just me, but the writing totally had me confused-I mean why the Hell is he laughing it up with the Joker after what both Jim and Barbara Gordon had just gone through? Why did Joker get such a lame back story? I would rather not know than have read that. I buy a lot of books off amazon based on reviews, but this is one that I disagree with the majority on. Not a great story at all in my opinion."
2,A bit overpriced,"I payed for it of course, but I still find it be a bit overpriced.It's one of the greatest Joker tales ever told, and an important one for any collector to have. Yet, for the sheer depth of the story arch and the amount that I was charged... It was just a bit pricey."
5,Jokerlicious,"One of the best graphic novels of all time. I Had to purchase it again after giving it away as a gift. The artwork is superb, as is the story. I recommend the hardcover edition for the collectors."
4,Great but short,"I loved this graphic novel! It was the third one I have read (Year One, and Dark Knight Returns) so I was expecting something longer. It was great none the less! I highly recommend!"
5,The Inner Workings of Joker (Today),"What ""The Killing Joke"" does more than anything else is explore the inner workings of the Joker and the complex relationship that exists between Batman and Joker. There is a powerful story here about the line that separates a normal person from insanity, and the things that can make a person cross it. Of course, the Joker also learns a lesson here, or would if he was capable."
4,Chilling and Revealing,"I find it a rare treat when villains are given as much depth as heroes (although in today's comics and films it is often the reverse). It is even more rare when a villain is drawn so completely that you can feel pity for him. Such is the case in this piece.Now of course the people responsible for this piece did not create the Joker from scratch, the last few pages were none the less heartbreaking. <SPOILER PERHAPS???> Batman offers to help the Joker and rehabilitate him, and instead of laughing in his face as a one dimensional villain of the week may, he simply said that it was too late for that and that actually the entire situation reminded him of a joke. (A pretty funny one at that.)In addition to well flushed out characterization there are also some chilling moments which show just how sick the Joker actually is.Very short, but VERY sweet piece of work here, folks."
3,Overrated,"It just does not live up to the hype. I heard it was one of the best batman comics ever written, it isn't. Right now, I'm on a Batman kick and I've read a lot the graphic novels considered to be great, The Dark Knight Returns, Year One, Hush, Long Halloween, and Dark Victory. They all lived up to the hype and they were all amazing. This one however, is not.It's incredibly short, the dialogue is actually pretty bad, and the story is just okay. The only thing I liked about it is the Joker's intensity. Very disappointing."
5,The best one off batman story out there,"In a sea of other wonderful Batman stories, I my money is on this as the best one off story about the bat. The artwork is beautiful and the story is perfect."
4,Great buy!,"This was everything I expected it to be.I've never been into Batman, Or anything Dc for that matter, But I love Alan Moore.So, I ordered it, It arrived, I read it.Art work is spectacular, Story is great, and watching Batgirl get shot in the stomach at point blank range was AWESOME.The only problem I had with it was the length. The book was practically over once you really get into it.Also, If you love Alan's work as much as I, then some of the afterword and stuff like that will kinda annoy you.Bottom line, If you like Alan Moore, BUY IT.I'm not sure how true Batman fans like it, so I would look into that if you love Batman."
3,Short and Sharp,"Great story that add's to the Joker Mythos - not sure if it's a good ""origin"" tale, but love Brian Bolland's art - the redone colours do the art full justice. A great read"
4,This book was AWESOME!!!,"This book was awesome!! Featuring one of the coolest villains out there, this book has the perfect personality for the Joker. The is for very mature readers because it may disturb some. In the Jokers most brutal campaign of horror he shoots Barbara Gordon, paralyzing her waist down, in three panels with no word balloons or sounds. It was completely unexpected and Alan Moore made it even more disturbing with what he did to Commissioner Gordon afterword when he tried to make Gordon go insane. The only bad thing is the Jokers origin. It's not that good, well at least I was expecting a little more story than that. Overall, a really enjoyable book!!!"
5,A possible origin of Batman's greatest enemy is revealed.,"This book finally attempts to give a history toone of comicdom's most famous, yet most engimatic, villians. The two parallel plots in the book of the Joker attempting to drive Commisioner Gordon insane in a manner similar to how he had, as displayed in the parallel plot. This book manages to convey a true humanity to this character as a man who had a real life and family and how it utter collapses around him. This culminates in the desperate crime that lead to his chemical scarring that marked his descent into madness. You will be left with a very different impression of the Joker as you finish one of the finest superhero stories ever written."
5,The Killing Joke,Beautifully drawn. Cleverly written. A timeless classic. Brian Bolland went back and added additional figures to his panels. It would be fun to compare an earlier version of this work to see who the new people are.
3,Overated,I had heard so much about this story that I may have set myself up for a letdown. The art IS spectacular and it is a fine story. I just walked away from it feeling like I had missed something. It is no Watchmen or V for Vendetta.
2,Review for HARDCOVER Batman: The Killing Joke,"The hardcover is not the The Killing Joke as originally presented to comic readers. For the original, you must buy the original GN one-shot, or DC Universe: The Stories of Alan Moore (Paperback) which reprints the original, as it was originally.It should be noted before buying the KJ Hardcover that:1) Brian Bolland radically recolored the entire story2) Batman's yellow oval is removed from the entire story (even though the story still takes place during Batman's ""yellow oval"" period)3) there is a subtle change to the cover; instead of just having the word balloon saying the word `Smile' with no punctuation, it now reads `Smile!'"
4,good graphic novel,The Killing Joke is one of the more significant Batman graphic novels. It is a little on the short side and feels rushed but the art of Brian Bolland combined with a quality Joker origin story makes it a winner. Putting the cripplingof BarbaraGordon into regular Batman continuity helps the story as well. Asolid piece of work
4,"Great artwork, not the best story","The artwork in this comic book is amazing with terrific transitions between colored panels depicting the present, and black and white panels depicting the flashbacks. The writing however is not up to the same standards thought. There are some clever lines, but the story on the whole is too predictable (except the very end)."
4,Better than the original,"I'll keep this short. I have the original ""prestige format"" copy and I STILL bought the hardcover...it's that great a story. One of my favorite Joker stories ever. I had to have it in hardbound."
5,Disturbingly Interesting,"I started reading Birds of Prey way before I read The Killing Joke and, I must say, the anticipation only added to my complimenting opinion towards this edition. I have never seen the Joker quite like this and, for some reason, his portrayed insanity seemed to fit even more now than ever before. The things that the Commisioner Gordon had to go through made me shiver. And seeing those naked pictures of Barbara, the intense expressions on his face while they forced him to look, almost made me cry. Those parts alone can emminate anger, sadness, sympathy, and all sorts of other emotions from a reader. If you have weak stomach for corrupt storylines, you shouldn't read this. But, I for one, enjoyed this very dark twist for the Batfamily's very first female member, and one of the initial villains that started it all."
1,Horrible Condition,"I bought the product, and it said the condition was new. I don't tolerate companies that say the product is new, but in reality its really not. On several of the pages in this book, there were multiple green pen marks. I was going to keep this book as a collection after reading it, but not anymore.On a side note the story is really good, which I would rate a 5/5. The past of Joker is revealed, and you learn much more about him. This is a must buy for Batman, and Joker fans. Just don't buy from this company!"
2,Brooding and mean-spirited addition to the Batman myth,"Please don't call me a ""wimp,"" but I am tired of the current trend in comicdom to turn Batman (and his enemies) into sympathetic and oh-so-neurotic souls. The Joker, while always a fruitcake, gets a makeover here, and is revealed to once have been a family man. OK, so what? Is that supposed to elicit a tear from the reader?Then, in the same story, he commits a crime so heinous to both Commissioner Gordon and daughter Barbara that the empathy one may have had for the fiend evaporates almost as soon as it appeared.Mind you, I don't like the non-Tim Burton-directed movie versions, either. And the 60's high camp of Adam West's series didn't add much.Only did the 90's animated version get the characters correctly.I, honestly, didn't find the ""joke"" worthy of my expenditure.Obviously, the majority of others represented here have different opinions...but, to each his own."
3,A fun romp...,"...but ultimately pointless. Adds nothing to the Batman legacy, but takes nothing away. It's just there, but any self-respecting Batman collector already owns it, and already knows this. Those searching for a weightier Batman story should look elsewhere."
3,It was a good book but way to short,I wish I could have given it a 4 or 5 stars but the book was way to short but if u lIke the joker this is a must have for a die hard fan
5,Powerful Story,"This was really incredible. The story was great, but what really made it so memorable was the terrific art and the way panels mirrored each other as we shifted from the Joker's tortured memories to the present day. I'm not sure I could see this being as effective in a different medium (such as video).This isn't just one for fans of the Batman; anyone who appreciates a story with impact should get Batman: The Killing Joke. HIGHLY HIGHLY RECOMMENDED"
3,Fantastic Story.....have one problem with this update.,"Okay so I bought this years ago when it first came out on paperback. Love the story and my favorite comic. However I do have a big problem with this update. I hate the colors they added to this new update. When you compare the 2 the older paperback ones the colors look fantastic and really emphasize the feelings and passion of this story. The new updated one loses that. Basically look at the old pictures and compare it with the new one. Storys the same, just looks different."
5,Excellent buy!,"Totally worth the buy.When i saw this book, i instantly got in love with it. It's those books you need to read and have to be a true Joker fan."
5,Must own,This book is a must own for any fan of Batman/Joker. It details the Joker's origin story. Great art and story.
3,Good but Overrated Batman Story,"The Killing Joke is a very famous comic. It gives us a glimpse into the Joker's origin and therefore humanizes the character a bit. In a way it also humanizes Batman, by seeing his reaction to the Joker's joke (the joke, by the way, is very funny).I was underwhelmed with this comic, as it is very famous and Tim Burton listed it as a big influence for the Batman movie. I think Alan Moore is the best comic book writer, so I was expecting this book to be out of this world. It isn't.This comic is very good and it is worth reading, but it is not worth buying for more than $5. I would suggest getting it in the trade paperback with Alan Moore's DC stories, which includes ""Whatever Happened to the Man of Tomorrow?""."
3,"Story is excellent, book unnecessary","Skip this unless you're a collector. Amazon carries the 2006 edition ofDC Universe: The Stories of Alan Moore, which includes this and many other excellent works."
5,great!,"You really get what you pay for. There are some things in this world that you just can't believe until you see it; Well, this is one of them! I really appreciate the people who put this film together, and so my review gets a two thumbs up!"
5,3 great movies 1 low price,"i love italien movies and they dont make them anymore like they used to back in the 80`s.If you love cheap effex,blood and gore,bad dubbing,porn music then go buy it..... + its cheap !! thank you shriek show"
3,It works But...,"if it breaks, you have two locations to send it to under warranty. Keep your box or UPS charges $50 to pack it and depending on your proximity to the west or east coast service centers...$128 bucks to ship. Obviously I am eating sour grapes over the loss of use of my set whilst it is up in New York getting its powersupply replaced.Having said that. I love the picture. Audio is good, but the remote control connection is absolutely appauling. I feel like Harry Potter waiving his wand trying to get the channel to change.Would I buy again...Unfortunately no. Look for local warranty service when you are choosing a brand. Perhaps if Westinghouse had more than two facilities in the whole blessed country, I might speak better of them."
3,Quality control leaves a lot to be desired,"bought one two weeks ago. had to bring back to store 3 times. 1st 2 were light leaks in corners. 3rd one was leaks,dead pixel and sound wasnt as good as 1st 2. i decided to give it 1 more shot and lucked out and got a good one. would recommend when they have it on sale for $900. wouldnt pay more for it.if quality control was better would give 5 stars for value."
4,Great for less than 900.,"Bought one on 1/2/2006. TV didnt pick up remote very well and had a line appear only 14 days after. I got a new one and all seems ok. As for picture quality and value, I would give it a 5. Like others, they have much to improve on."
3,Weigh the price with the length of use,I have had the LTV 32W1 for 3.5 years now and up to this point I have had no problems and I really enjoyed the TV. Great picture and easy to use. I bought it as an open item at Best Buy back in May 2006 for just under $800. The TV just recently started showing the symptoms of what everyone else is describing. The TV will be on for 15-20 mins and then blank out. I've been told by Westinghouse that it is a power supply board or a main board failure and either of these problems are common with this TV. Sending it to Westing house will cost you the shipping + $225. You can try to repair it yourself but the parts will run you around $100-130. Just something to think about when you consider buying this TV.
1,Very Dissapointed,"Purchased my LT32w1 at Best Buy about 2 years ago.worked great for about 6 months, then all of a sudden it started to shut itself off after about 10 or 15 min. of use . As time went on it got worse, now it wont come on at all. I found a service center here in PHX, that said they would try to fix it, Min chg, about $500. I got a new SONY, Good riddance WESTINGHOUSE"
4,"Great tv, 4 years and still going","I had to write a review about this TV that I bought over 4 years ago. Not a single dead pixel, plays daily almost constantly and never had a hiccup. I will be buying the newer LED tv's when they come out by Westinghouse. My only gripes are the black levels are not too great in a dark room and the backlight is a little too bright, but can be adjusted. I can say with confidence that this TV was a good choice in quality and longevity, and I bought it when it first came out for more than $1,000. Still got my money's worth from it. Ole reliable. I have seen as many negative reviews about Samsungs, LG, and Panasonics where people got lemons. So don't let a few negative reviews by non-professionals scare you away."
1,Main board burnout in 14 months,"I purchased this new at the end of July 2005. Main board started to go bad at the end of September 2006. Not many hours on the TV, and was not in use at all for 2 of the 14 months.Main board needs to be replaced. Have been trying to get the part for a month now to fix. Part was supposed to be here Dec. 2, now company tells us not until Jan. 4.Cost to fix, $400.00. Company is difficult to work with and securing replacement parts is proving to be almost impossible."
3,"Good Price, Not So Good TV","I got this TV at Best Buy on Black Friday for $480. It was a great deal, but I was still ultimately disappointed when I got home and tested it out. The picture was very washed out, even for the advertised 1000:1 contrast ratio (the same ration as most cheaper LCD TVs). The blacks were hardly black at all, and the TV had very few setup options, including only two different picture modes: widescreen or standard. When in widescreen mode, the picture is stretched if not coming from a widescreen source, which is to be expected, and in standard mode it would squeeze the image if not from a standard source. But it lacks an option for original aspect ratio (which is essential for DVDs still in theater-wide 2.35:1 aspect), nor did it contain an option to watch standard sources with the top and bottom clipped off.Of course, if you are just looking for a 32"" flat-panel TV, this certainly gets the job done. Just don't expect it to awe anyone."
4,"Except for 1 small problem, it's a great TV at a great price!","I received this TV yesterday to replace a Maxent LCD TV and I have say that the image quality is amazing. The size of the screen is just right for the living room of my apartment. I have separate speakers so I cannot comment on the sound. But picture quality is better than my Maxent by a big margin. Image is brighter and has a lot more definition. Menu is also easy to use.I found 3 stuck pixels on the screen, but from 5 feet away, they have absolutely no impact on the picture quality."
1,Junk. Buy something else,"After two years, it has died but not before giving me all sorts of headaches sorting out its error reports to keep it limping along. Go date someone you don't like, it'll be easier on you than trying keep this thing happy."
2,Great printer. Ink outrageously expensive,great printer. Broke once when I opened too hard. But ink is outrageously expensive! My suggestion is not to buy HP.
2,Big Headache,"I have owned a number of HP printers over the years, but this 3310 has been the most frustrating. First off I would like to say that they should rename the product , Photosmart this machine is not! After a half hour of loading software I fired the machine up, print quality was excellent, manual controls worked well, then I decided to check out the software only to discover it was a revamped version that the company has been using for the past 5 years. Very few of the 3310's functions could be controlled by the computer . Numerous bugs throughout. After spending 2 hours on the phone with HP no solutions were found, still a bundle of bugs. So if you want great printer quality that will waste hours of your time and is full of software bugs........this is it."
1,Out of Paper Error 90% of the time.........,"My 2 previous Printers where HP which I was very pleased with. I want the all in one but this is the printer from hell, It is so temperamental . It always errors out of paper no matter how perfectly you try to load the paper. Forget about trying to load a paper other than HP. I want take a sledge hammer to it and I've only had it 5 months. It's never worked right. Don't buy this model you'll be kicking yourself for buying such a expensive piece of junk.........."
2,"Good for network printing and faxing, horrible for scanning","Got this for the two Macs in my house, a laptop and imac connected with an airport. We can print fine, we can scan and fax, but we have never been able to resolve our issue with scanning a document for use in a file or scanning a document to create a picture file. I have been working with customer support who send me canned answers and keep telling me to uninstall and reinstall. Nothing works and finally today they told me that scanning over a network is not supported. WOW. Last time I buy an HP product. Probably works well with PCs, but I would steer clear if you're a Mac user using this as your home printer connected to your airport. It just cannot detect your computers and the help from customer service is generically obtuse."
3,Wouldn't recommend it,"I have had Cannon printers in the past and been very happy with them in all aspects. Have had this HP for about 6 months and not excited about it. First, I print everything in grayscale (not color) but it uses color ink like it is going out of style. Ink supply is very small and very expensive, even at Costco. I would say it uses twice the ink my Cannon did. Other problems include the printer changing settings for unknown reasons, small paper supply, poor software that doesn't allow you to switch from regular printing to photo without going through all the settings. I'm going to switch back to a Cannon."
1,Don't buy HP Products,I have had nothing but problems with the HP 3310 printer. First the paper feed wouldn't work. HP sent a re-manufactured printer as a replacement. It had problems with the fax. A half dozen calls to India solved that problem. Then the scanner broke. The Indians couldn't fix it so I took it to an independent dealer. She said it was a common problem with the printing mechanism and was un-repairable. Six units with the same problem in one month. I wrote to the HP help desk and they said they would respond. They did not. I wrote to the CEO of HP and he did not respond either. Don't buy products from a company that won't support them.
1,Printer that excells at wasting your time & money,"The ink cartridges for this printer are the size of a humingbirds bladder. If you want to spend hundreds of dollars on ink cartridges and replace them every other time you print, then this is the printer for you. If you want to wait minutes for the wireless connection to see and then print your documents and then have errors half of the time, again, this is the printer for you. If you want something that actually works well consider something else. This is not an ""all-in-one"" it is an ""all-for-nothing"" waste of money. Designed by HP to suck money out of your pockets and into their coffers after you bought the machine by charging you exhorbitant amounts for ink."
3,"Very particular, fussy HP printer - 2.5 stars","I bought this printer about 2 years ago, and overall I like it for plain paper, card stock paper & color printer. It works very well as a scanner & fax. But what I do not like about it is that it is a very ""particular"" or fussy printer. I am not able to put in different papers & envelopes of different sizes (custom size) as it will tell me that I am using incorrect paper. When I set the print quality at draft, the printer will print it out very quickly & very noisily but at the same time, the rollers & pins sound like they are going through a crusher; and it always jams up. When there's a paper jam, bits & pieces of the rollers will break off. Now it's paper jamming 9 times out of 10. I am now at the point that I am ready to junk this printer; but would like to keep it for the scan & fax features. I think I will go and buy a simple printer & use that as a second printer."
2,Worked well for only 5 months,"This printer only worked well enough for 5 months and than got a paper jam message. I cleared the paper jam and it still says, it still has a paper jam. I checked HP tech support and nothing was useful to help me resolve this problem."
1,Worst HP Printer Ever,"I have had this printer for over a year now. It makes great prints if you can actually get it to print.If you do any printing besides 81/2 x 11"" it takes a small amount of coding each time to program it to work.Also I now can't get it to realize I have a full blue cartridge in it.I have owned quite a few HP printers over the years and they all have worked pretty well. This one blows. Stay away."
1,Terrible tech support,"Update: After writing this review I checked HP's support site for the first time since February. They had a solution posted for this problem. Apparently the USB connectivity of the printer conflicts with its wireless capability. Solution: Disable the wireless connectivity. In the week since I did this I have had no crashes. Now if only HP tech support had told me this in February....I should have read the reviews on this site and others (CNet, epinions, etc.) before buying this printer. It appears HP either has a serious manufacturing problem or a serious software QA problem or both. HP replaced my original printer, which continually failed with the 'blue screen of death' problem reported by others. I waited EIGHT WEEKS for the replacement printer to arrive and it has exactly the same problem. I'll never buy another HP product."
2,Planned Obsolescence,"Started out OK. Then it started to use up cartridges at a high rate. It is a good thing each color has it's own cartridge. I shudder to think of the cost to replace muticolors. The wireless networking worked well.Then it happened, 18 days after warantee expiration - an ink system malfuntion. After talking to India, I found out I could get it replaced for $149 and change. I will use the money to return to Lexmark. Those printers and MFDs at least outlasted their warantees by several years.If you get it, get an extended warantee (I normally do not believe in them except for actual computers)."
4,HP 3310,"I haven't had this long enough to give a comprehensive review, but I really like it so far. I have been printing wirelessly and printing photos. Photos look like they came from a film lab. I don't have a hardline phone to test the fax function, but the bluetooth works well. Printer is VERY fast!"
1,Printer lasted 3 months.,"Hp does not know how to take care of their customers. This printer was exactly what I wanted, but in no time the feeder to the paper tore up. They sent me a downgraded one to replace it. HP needs to make their products more sturdier! I advise you not to buy, since they quit making this model."
2,HP Photosmart 3310,I had an HP 3310 that had recently died. I really liked the printer/fax/scanner combination and was disappointed with the current crop of offerings. I particularly did not like the eFax and the lack of ability to scan negatives and slides on replacement printers. Plus I had a number of ink-jet cartridges that I wanted to use. I ordered the 3310. When it arrived everything worked except the FAX. That was one of the main reasons for buying the device. I returned the 3310 and bought a new HP Photosmart 7515. It is not as good as the 3310 but...
2,Installation Nightmare,"I was unable to install the software for this very attractive machine despite over 3 hours on the phone with a very capable HP tech rep. They felt the problem was incompatability with Norton antivirus, even though we disabled all Norton services and windows firewall. A friend had a similar experience. It may be a great machine for those with PC's that can can load it, which I assume would include most machines."
1,Not compatible with printing spreadsheets,I would never buy an HP again...after hours on HP Chat and talking to someone from India who said I have to pay to talk to a specialist in fixing my problem...HELLO...I bought this yesterday...the machine is not compatible in printing spreadsheets...goodbye HP
2,Problem with this printer - it damaged my VAIO lap top,"this printer damaged my Sony VAIO VGN-360P (running on XP profession) during set up of lap top as connecting the printer via the USB port. As the USB cable is connected from the printer to the lap top, the lap top shut down immediately and cannot start up again. Tried to fix the lap top by removing all power sources and press on the POWER button to release all electric charges. This did not help. Reset the lap top via the reset button did not help either. After talking to the tech support at Sony, this lap top has to be shipped to Sony for repair.Did any one have this problem?"
2,Finicky and Frustrating...You Just Can't Have It All,"I bought this 3310 on the suggestion of the clerk at the university computer store for two reasons. First I had good experiences with HP Laser Printers in the past, both at home and work. They proved to be unstoppable workhorses, pumping out thousands of pages of crisp documents over years of use without fail, and using very little toner per copy. Second, the clerk sold me on the advantages of an ""all-in-one"" device.I have been continually frustrated for three years with constant error messages, a scanner that never seems to work without 6 or 7 reboots, and even then it simply won't do the majority of the tasks HP claims it will; and of course the ink cartridges are OUTRAGEOUS. I will never try an All-in-One again, at least not an HP."
1,Problems and Problems,"I keep getting an ""out of ink"" error message. Change or fill the ink cartridges. Message still exists. Turning the machine on and off, causes grinding for a good minute. Anyone, wants to pay shipping, they can have the unit."
1,Don't buy this,If you want to waste your weekend and time looking for fixes to the issues of this printer then go and buy it. What a waste of money and time. Still looking for why the printer and copier no longer printing black. I just bought all new ink and still not working.
3,It was ok,We played it maybe once. NOt fun having to put everything away. But I guess it was different. Probably more fun with a bigger group.
4,A fun and active game for kids and parents!,"My kindergartner has loads of fun with this game, and I love that it gets her moving. It's basically a board game version of the traditional scavenger hunt, and there are instructions as to what objects to find (which are basically items one can find around the house). The game is educational too as players are requested to find objects beginning with certain letters of the alphabet, etc. The little timer (a plastic hourglass) could have done with some tweaking as a timer which buzzes would have been better - especially when players are at the other end of the house. Be prepared for a major clean-up as objects from around the house start piling up in one corner (we play the game in our family room), but it is good fun and provides exercise for the players, so no complaints here!"
4,"Great Toy, Incomplete Set","My nephew wanted this for Christmas--and his favorite auntie came through! Sadly, not all of the pieces were included. The game itself is great--and thankfully he loves the hourglass so much he doesn't really notice the missing pieces. Had everything been included, this would be a five-star recommendation."
3,You Bet Your Life (Toby Peters Mystery),"I've reviewed several of these books in this series so I will keep this short. Of the several I'vd read this one is not too bad. My main issues are with the liberal borrowing of plot devices from Chandler, Hmmet, et. al. While a novel approach to detective stories I find the author's depth of the ""celebrity"" du jour is too uni-dimensional. It feels at times the author did a cursory Google search of celebrity X and doesn't add anything that makes you want to root for the star or really the characters in the story. If you don't want to think too hard and don't mind figuring out the entire plot in the first chapter or so then it is a fair, quick read. I will say this book and the next in the series regarding Howard Hughes are a slight cut above the rest in the series that I have worked through."
3,Why A Duck?,"I love the Marx Brothers, especially Groucho, so it was an easy sell to pick up this novel. I read the first book in the Toby Peters series and enjoyed it. This sequel was a decent read, with a believeable plot. I plan to buy and read the rest of the series soon!"
3,Two legged terrier,"As I have said about these novels before.These books are entertaining , light time passers. Bring back good memories of names, places, movies etc. from the past. Quite cleverly done"
1,The pump on the cream isn't working,Unfortunately the pump was broken on 2 of my creams and can not get them out so wasn't really happy with them at all.
3,Lego Star Wars Review,"Not as fun as Lego star Wars II. I don't like that I can't slap people and the flying levels are difficult to manage. Yoda is a little unmanageable as well, but it's not so bad. Mace Windu is AWESOME. It skips a lot of story line so be prepared for that. It was nice for a start, but like I said, Lego Star Wars II really kicked it up a notch and was much better."
3,Star wars lego game,"the only con I have about this game is that if your person can't use the force, he (Or she) can't build bricks"
3,Boring.,"I gave Lego Star Wars a good long try when my brother got it for Christmas. He says he loves it. The person that gave it to him says he loves it. I was almost bored to tears. Though I liked playing in multiplayer mode with my brother, the game itself was nothing more than slashing everything and collecting random lego parts. Just like regular Legos, I wish it was more fun than it actually is."
4,Nice,Too bad Nintendo is no longer making games for the Gamecube forcing everyone to buy the Wii. These games are every bit as entertaining.
3,Play Lego Star Wars before Lego Star Wars II,"Lego Star Wars is a fun game, though a bit short. Its main weakness to me is that I played Lego Star Wars II first. LSW2 is far better than the first; the developers clearly learned and improved on all the strengths and also removed the weakest aspects.If you've played LSW2 already, you might pass on this one. But if not, start here. And when you've finished it, definitely get the sequel."
1,acceptable....yea for lil bit,had small crack...played for 2 days then quit working so i tossed o well. Maybe better luck with some one else
5,Great game! Engaging and challenging.,"Fun game with extra features for kids with a sense of humor. Great action game with great graphics , especially since were dealing with Lego characters~"
5,GOOD GAME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"LEGO Star Wars is a good game, everything is made out of LEGO. You can unlock episodes and characters. Plus, the game starts off in Dexter's Diner. No, you can't order a meal, but you can walk into a weird room, trying to find a way to get to Episode One and trample in on the Trade Federation's next blockade project. You can either play as Obi-Wan, Qui-Gonn, and some droid that is good at unlocking stuff, and no it is not C-3PO or R2-D2. You have to collect studs, LEGO Pieces, and complete missions to get to more episodes. Sometimes you can get confused of what LEGO Star Wars character your playing as.This game is a good game!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
4,"Pretty Good, Challenging Enough","My dad bought this game for me. He ordered it via Amazon. It is pretty good. I rate it four stars. It is challenging enough. I thought each time I play that I would never lose any of my progress, but even though I'm wrong, this game is still fun. Recently, I had a playdate with one of my good friends, and I got pretty far. Like most other reviewers like this game, I do as well.A pretty good game!!!From Chris!!!"
3,Not as relaxing as a stretch tape should be.,"This tape is compiled from the classic series of Firm tapes. The instructors are really limber, and they tend to stretch their muscles in ways that regular people can't comfortably do. You can modity the stretches, however, to fit your body. It's a decent tape, but it's outdated."
1,Disappointing,"Not many songs. A few songs, I've never heard before, and have no interest in hearing again, ""Could it Be Magic"", not even included, and it was one of his best. More like a rehersal. Producer telling the audience when and how to clap. (ugh) Some songs he sung over, because he wasn't satisfied with the way he sung them. Bits and pieces of songs repeated. Barry didn't sound his best. He should lower the key on some of them. When one ages, or doesn't practice enough, voice tends to deepen. Too much talking to the audience and not enough singing. Seemed very full of himself."
5,Worth the buy!,"Even if you saw or taped the television show, this DVD is worth buying. I got a copy of it a couple of months ago from the fan club, so I've already viewed it numerous times.With this DVD, you get two versions of the show: what was aired on CBS and what was taped. The taped version is full of funny outakes, redos (his ""frog"" at the end of Mandy), interesting talk and even an extra song (Somewhere Down the Road). Also Barry's peronal dialogue is on that version.An entertaining show, an uptempo audience and Manilow's irresistable melodies in top form. Don't miss it!"
5,really tight show,"I saw this show on CBS&truly enjoyed it.Barry Manilow is a true Showman,composer,Conductor&Understands how to pace&Entertain from start to finish.this is a very enjoyable Performance all the way through."
1,It's really not a bargain,"The animation is crude and the music is monotonous. I have to admit that it holds my 3-year old's attention, but any adult will find it unbearable. There is not even the slightest comparison to the Disney classics and I will be tossing this out and replacing it immediately."
2,"Same great story, poor implementation and adaptation",If you are used to the Disney version you may not like this version of snow white. I didn't care for it but the kids seemed to like it.
1,Did not work,The DVD was formated wrong or a defect because neither of my DVD players could read it. It would probably cost more to ship it back.
1,Horrible Movie,"Jada really missed the mark with this movie. The storyline, production and audio are all horrible. The camera movement and look of the film is really great but who wants to watch a film to see this portion of crafting. For this to be her first directed project she did not impress me at all and if she makes another movie I will be hard pressed to view her work. Midway through the movie one of the actors adopts a English accent but the accent wasn't present at the start of the film. No wonder Sony Pictures sent this straight to DVD and avoided a theatrical release. I waited four years for this movie and I am very disappointed."
2,A WASTE!!,"This movie should have been much better! The story line is week, besides the sexy actor the movie was a waste! This movie should be on Lifetime."
2,I am disappointed...,"I was buying this CD based on reviews only (which is something I've learnt not to do ever again). I was exepticing to put the CD in my stereo and be blown away, but the disappointment was as big as the expectation. The Compositions sound well, if not less, and they are far from showing James LaBrie's vocal talent. Also I was expecting Tim Donahue (which is said to be a talented guitarist) to show his guitar skills but all I heard was simple tunes which every evarage guitarist can play easily.I'm not saying the album is horrible, there are *nice* songs here and there, but hey, I was expecting more. Especially from an imported album which costs more than every other album and takes a lot more time to get to your house.vuttom line: Don't base your oppinions on review and try to hear the album before buying it!"
3,haven't tested yet,"Bought for my 14 years old baby, she didn't like it too much so i will keep it in a drawer and show it later"
5,"Super DVD, beautiful cinematography","I love watching shows about animals on Animal planet, Discovery and national Geographic, but it can be heartwrenching to see the animals get stalked and killed (even though this is the way nature intended!).This DVD is very uplifting to watch, no killing, only happy baby animals with their mothers.Not sure how they got all the scenes, but it is very enjoyable. The polar bear cubs are exquisite!Definitely worth the money- for kids or adults."
2,Boring,While this DVD has nice video it is narrated as a documentary. I brought it for my young son who loves animals and he lasted less then ten minutes with it. Not entertaining for children.
1,Did Not like at all!,"i purchased this dvd for my grandson..... and what a boring, boring dvd. i wish i had not purchased it. it is very boring for a little child. i found myself falling asleep. my grandson sat there for a second and moved on to doing other things. he loves animals and watches other animal shows but this one is a dud..... i want my money back!"
5,best book on multivariate analysis,"This book gives the clearest and most elegant presentation of the theory of multivariate analysis I have seen. The reader should have a good background in linear algebra before starting this one, but with this background the authors give a very concise treatment of a large area of statistics. Many topics that are not covered in most multivariate analysis texts are covered here. The exercises are also outstanding. Many of them are very difficult and lead to more profound results. I highly recommend this text!"
4,unique country blues,"Ed Bell used a unique guitar style that is more riff-based, rather than always following the standard blues chord changes. The first four tracks on this CD from Bell's first session are, in my opinion, quite stellar. Each features a memorable melody and a distinctive guitar part. The remaining tracks are a bit more of a mixed bag, especially as regards sound quality. Like a lot of other blues artists, there is a fair bit of musical repetition. However, there is enough variety to keep me interested through most of the running time. Some songs feature Clifford Gibson on guitar, who played in a more urban type of style. Other tracks recylcle the melody and guitar part from the first track, ""Mamlish Blues. I'm quite fond of the 8 bar folk song called ""She's a fool"" that appears a few times that sounds like something John Hurt or Mance Lipscomb would play. The two tracks at the end by Pillie Bolling are a nice addition. Pillie plays and sings in a relaxed, up-beat kind of style."
5,down to the wire:the lives of the triple crown champions,"WONDERFUL!!!!! EMOTIONAL!! well researched. bob shoop is great writer. this is the story of eleven of the greatest horses that ever graced the earth.their lives(personalities good and bad),their lineage, the fortunate men who rode them,their owners,their opponents,the tracks they raced and their emotional deaths.incudes the origins of the ""triple crown"".addendum includes comprehensive statistics of both horses and jockeys.yes folks,america DOES have royalty.their names are not kennedy or bush."
2,Few pictures and discouraged,"I bought this one expecting to see many pictures on the last day of JFK,but the book covered very few pictures and even they are not colored."
3,Meets the need,"If you consistently use dowels in your projects than you may want a more accurate jig. However, I use dowels when needed so this jig works fine for the amount of I use it receives."
1,Save your money,"This book covers maybe 60 percent of what is on the actual test. The first 2/3 of this book offer no explantion whatsoever for the answers for the practice exams (it does provide decent explanations of the reading comprehension section, but by then your so flustered with the utter lack of information it's too little, too late) You can learn pretty much everything you need by downloading a list of legal terms from anywhere on the web, and grab any english book to get a foothold on grammar. Better yet, do what I did spend half the money on a Kaplan civil service book, where it actually gives you strategies for taking the test, in other words that book actually helps and doesn't look like it was slapped together by two guys making these lousy books in their basement.If you want to throw away 30 dollars on something that cost 30 cents to make, that's your perrogative. There are far cheaper and more effective ways to prepare yourself for the court assistant test."
1,Inaccurate and cheap,"The price for this scale says $19.95 marked down to $9.99, but it really is more like $.50 marked up to $9.99. Right out of the box, the scale does not zero out--because the plastic top to the scale rubs and catches on its plastic base when you stand on it. And the scale reads my weight 10 lbs. lighter than it actually is. Not everything made in China is horrible, but this particular Chinese piece of ""craft"" is horrible."
4,Nice Package For The Money,"I liked the package and thought there was nothing else out there until I found the Gartel- Trance, Dance and Other Living Things DVD. There is nothing like it in exsitence. I have watched it 8 times and am still experiencing new sounds and new visuals. This Gartel fellow is called the ""Father of Digital Media"" and now I know why. He created 14 mini movies using every multi-media effect known to mankind, plus several of his own that he threw in for good measure. He set these in time to various trance, dance, and electronic tracks, done in dolby digital 5.1 surround sound. It was truly a trip. Worth every penny. If you have a big screen tv and surround sound, this is a must! For anyone into Adobe, Graphics, or Art, his images are inspiring. Buy the Trance experience plus Gartel, just so you will have a comparison of what I am talking about."
3,Not Bad,"I was at my local record store and i thought I'd pick it up. I am a huge trance fan so i wasnt realy worried about it being a waist of money. Plus, it was only 17 bucks, so if the DVD was bad and the CD's were good (or vise versa) it was like I only bought one anyway. Well I would just like to say that the CD's are TERRIBLE!! Worst trance I have ever heard. Except for the tracks that are on the DVD (the DVD tracks are mixed into the CD). The DVD however was pretty good. Had a lot of good tracks on it, and the visuals were a nice change. It has live footage of clubs and graphics. I would give the DVD 4 out of five stars and the CD's one at most. So if you got 20 to spend, you should do for it. (The craziest part of visuals, is a face that rolls around on the screen)"
2,Not so great...,"I bought this fryer for my mom for Mothers Day. It doesn't have settings for what cooking different food, and for some reason no matter what setting we have it on the food smells and tastes burnt and smoky. I should of given her a different one."
4,LARGE and in Charge,"Very fast, reliable scanner for our office...as it should be for $2k. Co-worker who scanned photos and negs for a living said it was very quick and quite for it's size and resolution. Would buy again if need to. Fire-wire a big plus. Be sure to have dedicated space for this, about a 26in x 20in footprint."
4,An excellent read - again from William Boyd,"William Boyd is an exceptionally talented writer; I say this as he has a deep understanding of women. I have found this unusual in male writers, I noticed it firstly in ""Restless"" and now reconfimed in this book. A great writer and fantastic books"
3,Brazaville Beach,"This was not what I expected after having read Any Human Heart, which I enjoyed very much. I did not like Hope, the heroine of the book and I thought her jobs were very out of character with her type, sitting watching the apes and classifying hedgerow plants for a woman who set her eyes on her man a made up her mind to have whatever....and being as qualified as she was yet blind to what John Clearwater was like.. not my favourite book.Karen Cunningham - Portugal"
3,Interesting but not fascinating,"This is the story of Hope Clearwater who studies chimpanzees in Africa while reminiscing on her failed marriage back in England. While I found the chimpazee study and the description of the scientific world around it interesting and informative, I did not find myself carried away by the narrative. Not a bad book, just not as good as I was hoping it would be."
3,"not that funny, a bit too bizarre","I really enjoyed ""A Good Man in Africa"" and some of William Boyd's novels, but this one was not that funny and the story about researchers trying to deny the carniverous nature of the chimps they are studying got a bit too weird."
4,Good reading,"This first half dragged a little bit. I thought that the book suffered a little bit of over-explanation. The second half was more interesting. Overall, a good commute book.Everytime that I see a chimp, I will remember this book."
5,Brazzaville Beach is a good read.,"A wonderful story about the way things were and the difference of how they are now are. Filled with warmth and life with meaning. Boyd always has a message beyond the ""me"" syndrome."
1,UUHHMM?? I DON'T THINK SO,"I WAS BORN AND RAISED IN THE MISSION DISTRICT OF S.F.---I DON'T THINK THAT JUST LISTING THE NAMES OF 5 OR 6 STORES IN A ROWQUALIFIES FOR A TRUE DEPICTION OF THE """"REAL"""" """"MISSION""""---SORRY.AND THE PORTRAYAL OF THE COPS---UNBELIEVABLE---SORRY. I AM PROUD TO SAYTHAT I WAS BORN & RAISED---GRADUATED FROM """"MISSION H.S.""""---FISHED ATAQUATIC PARK PIER---THIS BOOK DOES NOT MAKE ME PROUD."
3,"Not so comfortable, mainly due to the tightening nut.","Many years ago I had one of these on my Galant, so I bought one for my Mustang. For some reason I didn't feel this one as comfortable as the previous one. Maybe the thickness of the shift lever, but the tightening nut between the middle and ring fingers made it bothersome. Notice that the nuts pictured are not the ones that came with the handle I ordered.I ended up removing and returning it. I bought a pistol type (vertical) and I like it a lot more than this."
1,Did not work,This item did not work with my HP laser jet 4 Plus printer and windows 7 operating system. The Operating system could not detect the printer with this adapter connected.
4,It works,"The product description lists the length of this cable as 1.7 meters. That is false. Its really 3 feet. 1.7m = 5.5 feet. As it is, this thing is barely long enough to connect my printer and computer with no room to spare. Besides that major oversight, the product worked as advertised. Don't forget to go into your printer settings and change the port to the virtual USB port you get after plugging it in."
3,Almost worked.,"Using Ubuntu 8.10.With the USB adapter Ubuntu properly detects my printer and I can send print jobs to it, but only the first few lines print. The printer goes offline and Ubuntu warns me it might be unplugged.So I installed a parallel port header instead."
1,Functionally useless for ALL computers,"I have a Dell Inspiron 1520 laptop running Windows XP. Now, none of that makes a difference. why? The disc HAS NO EXE just 2 dll files labeled for windows 2000 and windows ME. However, the labeling doesn't matter. without any kind of auto-run or exe, the disc is useless. This is a total waste of money."
2,Don't Buy,Could not get it to work with an old HP laser printer and a windows 7 computer. HP does not make a driver for it that you can download.
5,Works Well,Works pretty well with HP LaserJet 6L in Windows vista. Had to enable printer pooling with LPT1 and USB ports.
1,not worth money,windows 7 see's the printer but it won't print and there was not documentation with this. just came in a little envelope. no drivers nothing.
1,Failed in 10 minutes,This adapter failed after 10 minutes. I didn't even finish installing the printer. I plugged it in and it showed up fine. Then 10 minutes later it started showing errors in windows and it would not detect it again.
2,Bide your time,"I had ordered this cable and cd that comes with it because my HP 5p refuses to go quietly into the recycling bin. But the cd wouldn't install properly into my Toshiba laptop and so I stuck the cable on a shelf for a couple of years and used another printer. Long story short, I purchased a HP Pavilion dv6 laptop and was able to download the drivers from the HP website to operate my HP 5p using the USB 3.0 port! Thank you, HP! Cable 4 stars, CD zero stars, average two stars."
2,"Printer cable works, but . . .","Purchased this cable for use in connecting HP LaserJet 5P to new PC running Win7 Pro 64. The printer works but with qualifications. The printer does not connect with the PC during startup. The printer has to be removed by going into Control Panel/Devices and Printers, right-clicking on the printer icon and selecting Remove Device. Restart the PC and the printer will be reinstalled and function correctly. The printer will be reinstalled and function properly only if it is Removed prior to shutting down the PC. Contacted another provider and explained my problem. I was told I would have to do the same with their product."
3,works most of the time,"Easy install software, the computer always recognizes the printer. But sometimes the printer does not know it's connected to the computer and does not print."
5,It's cheap but does it's job,I used it to replace my old printer cable since the newer computer didn't have the same ports as the old computer. This cable was a bit slower than the other one but for the price it did it's job right.
2,Wrong Item,"I cannot use the product. It is for the second time I have purchased such USB to parallel printer cable only to receive again the incorrect parallel connector. The model #s are/is per the HP printer's documentation (Parallel IEEE 1284) , the Amazon website picture does not clearly show the connector(s), and the result is that they/it does not fit."
3,usb adapter,"I put my opinion about this product in the feedback & Tom L. from the sales contacted me. He asked that I try several more times to get the product to work, it would not work. Tom contacted me again and said they would give me a full refund for the product. I'm impressed, I had not ask for the refund but Adapter world took it on themselves to do this. Thank you very much.Sincerely,F.Koch"
2,none,"nothing really to contribute - wasn't what we expected. We could not tell from the photo nor from the description, which printer this could fit and it didn't work for us. Thank goodness we didn't pay much for it."
4,did the job,"This is an uncomplicated application, so not much to say. Windows 7 understood what to do with the printer when connected via this cable"
4,Low cost solution,"I didn't have to buy a new printer for new computer because this cable seems to do the trick! Much cheaper than at local big box. Printer does not work each time, but I figured out what to do. Not the fault of the cable I don't think, perhaps more of a Vista thing. Very prompt delivery. Good over all!P.S. If you haven't watched the DVD ""OldBoy"" yet, you should."
1,Worthless junk,Looked like a perfect solution. My new computer has no parallel ports to connect my printer. Nice easy solution to convert parallel to USB? WRONG! this junk does not work. I tried it on numerous ports in 3 different computers. Take it off the market and stop confusing people with crap.
3,Satisfied,"All in all satisfied, it works. Do not however expect ""Plug 'n Play"". You will have to search for the Win 7 drivers. Also, looks nothing like the photo."
1,"Maybe good, maybe not",I don't know for sure...Installation was easy...My computer recognized the printer and autoloaded the driver...but the printer doesn't work (it was working before). So I don't know wher the problem is.
2,Does not work with XP or Vista,Not sure what this cable is used for but I bought 2 and neither worked. I have a HP4050N and have a new XP Computer. Printer locks up and says processing job.I am required to use laser at my office and the 4050 are work horses. My computer guy says to get a new printer. Ya right. Went to HP site same issues. It is not just this product but all Par-USB cords. I heard Belkin works gonna try but it cost 4X more than this one. Bummer. If that doesn't work I will have to buy a new printers.
1,Didn't work on my Windows 7 64-bit Vaio,"The installation cd was no help, but I was able to find the driver via Windows installer anyway. Still, my pc didn't recognize the device, unfortunately. It looks like I am going to have to buy a new printer. At least this item was cheap enough that I don't feel the need to return it."
3,jsb to Parallel IEEE1284 Printer Adapter Cable PC,The small diameter disc that accompanied the adapter would not work in the CD reader of my laptop. Unit communicated with printer after attaching to computer but so far I have been unable to get all of the bugs out of the setup. Printer strikes over prrevious print. For some reason the printer is advancing very slightly before the restrike.
1,Does not work.,"Purchased for my father's portable printer. Did not work and he's a pretty computer literate person. He went to fry's electronics and purchased one like it and this one works perfectly. Why? Not sure, it may be defective or may be more complex than it needs to be to use. Either way, it did not satisfy our needs."
1,Disappointed,"I contacted Computer Geeks twice by email and have never received a response. The printer cable I received is not the one that is needed for my printer and cannot get an answer on how to return, if there is one that will work for my printer, etc... so this is just money down the drain and a learning experience. Will NOT order from Computer Geeks again without resolve to this issue.Do not feel it is Amazon's fault---have ordered from them before with wonderful results. This experience, dealing with Computer Geeks (or better worded---NOT dealing with Computer Geeks) has been my first BAD experience."
1,Did not work.,"After getting a new laptop that only supported USB, I purchased this parallel/USB printer cable in an attempt to save my Multifunction Laser printer that I paid over $350 for and didn't want to have all that money go down the drain due to new technology. Unfortunately the device never worked; the cable did not come with a driver and my new computer did not recognize it. I was never able use my printer. I ended up having to purchase a new printer that supported USB, luckily it was on sale. This cable isn't worth it. Just let the old equipment go... and upgrade."
1,USB to Parallel IEEE 1284 Printer Adapter Cable PC,My old computer recognized the printer well and the driver was installed.But not printable.I am figuring out what's the probelm.
1,It did not work,"It was a junk, did not work. wasted my money on this useless cable. I should have bought a bit more expensive cable."
1,USB to parallel IEEE 1284 Printer Adapter Cable PC,"The disk was cracked when I received it and te cable didn't fit to my printer; therefore, it was a total waste of money."
1,"Poorly made, with bad wire connections.","It was a waste of time and money trying to keep an old printer connected to your new computer, despite the fact it still works."
5,A Beautiful Obsession,"Fitzcarraldo, a movie about an obsessed man made by an obsessed man, Werner Herzog.This creative process is observed in Les Blanks documentary ""Burden of Dreams"" a wonderful and vivid studywhich, in my opinion, must be viewed to fully appreciate ""Fitzcarraldo"" The main character in ""Fitzcarraldo"" is played by the eccentric german acting legend Klaus KinskiWith mouth-dropping imagery and tone This is a truly satisfying film ""A film which only Werner Herzog could make"""
3,Pretentious,"The uniquely talented Herzog and Kinski team up again. I gave ""Aguirre: The Wrath of God"" 5 stars as it captures white men's quest to see every land. This one represents their subsequent obsessions. In theory, that's fine, but this movie tries way too hard to impress you with the main character's devotion to opera. It ends up manipulating the viewer with self consciously clever setups and a trite conclusion. I was unable to forget I was watching a work of fiction long enough to empathize."
4,You Won't Believe It,"This movie would not be believable if it weren't based on fact. And the facts that are faithfully recreated in this movie are so intense that this flick will alter your perception of reality for much longer than it takes to watch it. That such a big, colorful, artistic dream can exist in a world as flawed as ours is nothing less than miraculous. Just like the movie."
1,Idiotic beyond description,"The ongoing popularity of this loser of a film as an underground cult classic is clear evidence that some people will like anything if it's pointless enough to appear profound. From the ridiculous underlying conceit to the vapid performances by the European characters ... to the awkward, poorly synced voice dubs ... to the interminably sloth-like pace of the scenes ... to the low-budget production values ... to the by-now-well-documented exploitation of the indigenous people (the only true talent represented in this film) ... Fitzcarraldo is a classic example of the type of narcissistic navel-gazing posturing as avant-garde art that is currently in vogue. The sooner this entire genre joins the heap of once-popular duds that wiser generations deem unworthy of veneration, the better. The only reason I gave this film one star is because Amazon's rating system does not allow me to assign it a negative number. Don't waste your money or your time with this turkey."
3,Adventure Directed,"Dream-like and appearently burdened by technical troubles, Herzog's film slogs its way upstream as more of a testimonial to realism than as a contrived formula for entertainment. As hostile locations and dangerous cinematic sequences are dealt more and more by pamperhanded mouse fidgeters painting on digital editors, it is inspiring to see Herzog approach the task of shooting larger than life sequences using a real ship, a real jungle, a real South American river, on real film reels. This film was a must for me--an adventure filmaker in the making. No star wars for me. I like my calluses and scars; and any likeminded viewers will like Fitzcarraldo. (Set on the shelf beside ""Lawence of Arabia"", ""The Man Who Would Be King"", and ""Lord Jim""."
3,a mixed bag,"This is an intelligent film, with great cinematography and good performances, but it is too slow. If you liked ""At Play in the Fields of the Lord"" (another Latin-American-jungle-locale literary film that a lot of people loved, but I thought was slow) then you might like this one."
3,not a review,"For those that don't know, Fitzcarraldo was a real-life person, and he was actually Peruvian--not a foreigner. Just so you know."
5,Fantastic film!,"Wow! This is one of the best films I have seen in a long time. I skipped it when it first came out because I thought it sounded like some kind of spin-off of ""Aguirre,"" which it is not. It was mesmerizing from beginning to end. The DVD is well worth buying, including a full-length interview commentary with Herzog. The scene of Fitzcarraldo playing his Caruso recording to calm the natives is one of my favorite movie images ever."
2,Laboriously drawn-out for a book so loosely structured.,"Naipaul overdid it with this 500+ page book that wanders through snippets of countless stories, but never dwells long enough in any of them. The book is valuable for the slices of East Indian life revealed, but its charm wore off halfway through. I would recommend looking elsewhere for Indian material. A novel would have continuity of plot and character, whereas this had only the continuity of pulling the rug out from underneath the reader again and again"
2,An attempt to cash in on the popularity of the previous book,"The previous book - ""India: A wounded civilization"" is a classic; It is also short and concise. As they say in Hindi, ""Gagar mein Sagar"", which literally means: filling a sea into an earthen pot.This book is just an attempt by the publishers and the author to cash in on the popularity of the previous book. I have finished chapter 1, Bombay Theater, but so far there are no earth shaking ideas or fundamentally new analysis. It is just non stop descriptions of houses, living rooms, people's attires, so on and so forth, ad infinitum. I have put it back on my bookshelf. May be, some day when I get so bored that I will read it again, until then, adieu."
3,Curiously unengaging,"I was expecting more from this book. Naipaul is undoubtedly a massively talented writer and storyteller, but I found this work curiously unengaging. Maybe there *are* too many stories in this book to get fully engaged with any of them, or maybe the characters themselves aren't compelling. A disappointment on the whole."
2,"Somewhat entertaining, but contains inaccuracies","This book does highlight some interesting or important patents, but just upon skimming it, I noted several inaccuracies. One statement implied that the civil war and reconstruction was part of the reason for the patent act of 1836 (a good score and a half before the civil war), and another part of the book stated that the formula for coca-cola, the most famous trade secret in the world, was patented. These inaccuracies made me question the accuracy of the entire work. In addition, much of the information is available on the PTO's web site for free."
4,enjoyable series.,"Well worth a look at, nice change of pace from the modern story line.Britsh period piece that remains entertaining, well produced and acted."
5,fine product,"product arrived in fine condition. it is wonderful to return to witty, intelligent dialogue and finely dressed characters. a wonderful visit to slower paced times."
3,THE LORD PETER WHIMSEY MYSTERIES SET TWO,"I Have just completed watching ""Murder Must Advertise"" and ""Five Red Herrings"". Altho the first was rather good, the latter was a disappointment. There were too many characters with too many alibis, and too many sub-plots. I have been an ardent fan of anything connected to Dorothy Sayers but these two are not up to her excellent writing. Altho Whimsey and his side-kick butler were good they just couldn't pull this one out of the doldrums. Ian Carmichael and Glyn Hunter were excellent in their roles. Maybe Ian is a bit old for the part, but that is soon forgotten when one has the pleasure of his fine acting. I will not give up on Lord Whimsey and look forward to the next series."
4,Sam Harris CD,"I ordered this CD from a Marketplace vendor. It arrived quickly. The CD did not disappoint, so I ordered another one for my sister in Arizona, which she received quickly. My CD, however, was defective and would not play the final selection without skipping. I requested an exchange from Amazon.com, who, in turn, notified the Marketplace vendor. The vendor immediately contacted me to let me know that a replacement CD was already sent to me by mail and that there was no need to return the defective CD to them. I appreciate that and understand the logic of their not wanting to pay return shipping on an item that they cannot resell. I have not received the replacement CD yet, but I am hoping it will arrive soon."
3,Ehh,"I've never tried a cinnamon mouthwash before. I love cinnamon but I don't really care for this mouthwash. Idk, I think I'm used to listening and this stuff doesn't seem strong enough. And no it does not leave my breath fresh for hours."
1,Lavoris Is Ruined - What a Shame,"I just bought a bottle of Lavoris and the formula has definitely changed. All the recent reviews are right, it isn't nearly as potent as it was before. The cinnamon flavor was much stronger in the older formulation. It doesn't seem like the same mouthwash anymore. Don't buy this until Lavoris decides to go back to the original formulation. It just isn't as effective as it was before (the formulation I tried two years ago).I used to LOVE this mouthwash. Now it's well below average.The bottle says: ""Distributed By Greenbrier International, INC Chesapeake, VA 23320"" .... ""MADE IN CANADA""... SKU: 10667 ... UPC Code: 870929003501 ... and on the backside of the bottle about 3/4 the way up the bottle it says 1209/N263AC in black lettering on the plastic (kind of difficult to see).I hope that info helps. Maybe we can figure out when/if they decide to go back to the original potency."
1,cost,Lavoris mouthwash is great. have used it for years. but be aware who you order from. i thought by the price that it was a box of 4 bottles for $13.25 but it turned out to be for 1 bottle. my fault for not checking closer but the seller is really cheating you at this price.
5,Still the best,I determined that Lavoris Cinnamon was the best mouthwash over 30 years ago. I was happy to find it again. Guess what? It is still the best.
2,Pointless,"I was disappointed by this book. The writing was good, but it went nowhere. Unfortunately, I had not realized it was a ""literary"" book. Going nowhere seems to be part of the definition of literary.I can tolerate some ambiguity in an ending, but not this much. I want to know if the main character is crazy or sane OR if any part of the story really happened or she imagined it all. I don't require both, but give me one or the other. Publishers Weekly's review as summarized above ends with, ""...subtle and chilling portrait of that much scrutinized figure, the postfeminist wife."" Give me a break! It wasn't postfeminist, it was POINTLESS."
1,terrible book,This book was a disappointment. Many questions unanswered by the end of it. Could have been written better to fill in all the empty holes left by writer. Would not recommend this book.
4,Very Interesting..,I had to read it to the end. You just feel a Mother knows her children.I really liked it. Didn't expect that ending. Good writing.
1,reader thrown under the bus,"Like many others, I was confused by this book and disappointed in its ending. The plot did not move. I was glad the book was short so that, at last, I would know what was going on. No such luck. My own conclusion was that kids (Katie and maybe Charlie?) will go to extremes to get their parents attention and bring them back together. On a common sense level, if you suspect that your child is not your child, you don't just adapt to it. You try to find out unless you're a little or a lot messed up yourself. Maybe this was an attempt to get inside the mind of a very disturbed woman. I couldn't wait to get out."
1,Didn't finish it,"It's unusual for me not to finish a book, but after reading the first chapter twice, I had to admit I just ""didn't get it"". At least after reading some of the other similar reviews, I'm comforted by the fact that it wasn't only me who had this problem. I felt like I came into the book in the middle of the story; possibly that was intentional, but I was more confused than intrigued, and I just didn't feel like putting in the effort required to figure it out. I admit I skimmed through it, looking for clues, and even read the ending, but still decided to give it up. It just wasn't for me."
4,A waking dream...,"I think what I found disturbing about this book is that, although Meg Landry is SURE that the boy on the bus is NOT her son, Charlie, she doesn't seem to mind. I found the fact that she wasn't freaking out, screaming, carrying on, etc yelling ""Where is my son??"" a bit odd. It seemed as though no one else in their family seemed to care as well. To quote Charlie's father, ""He looks enough like him."" What??? I liked the book for the author's excellent prose, but I was truly disappointed that she didn't come to a conclusion about what, in fact, happened to Charlie."
3,Strange And Implausible,"This story didn't really work for me for one reason. A parent who spends as much time as this one did with her child simply KNOWS their child,inside and out. Therefore, I just couldn't buy the premise. Perhaps if she hadn't seen him for a year,it would've worked. The other charactors were just annoying and I really wanted them out of the way to focus on the main story better,and hopefully explain why she thought this boy was hers. An Ok read but too many holes in the plot make it a confusing one."
1,yawn,This book was such a waste of time. After pages and pages of reading about the mother worrying about her son and nothing else I had to stop reading it. I would not suggest reading it unless you are in the mood for a great bore.
3,Does not work on X360,"Amazon.com Please note that this game is NOT compatible with the X360.I bought it expecting to be able to play it on my X360 with ease. Unfortunately, it does NOT work.This game is rated as 3 stars, average game play and average fun, because it was an average game...=p"
2,shattered union is not what it could be,"You know, I really like turn-based strategy (TBS) games. I really get into the tactics of holding territory, using lines of sight, and planning out my offensives in painstaking detail. Maybe that's why I hate this game so much. Shattered Union really does do an amazing job- of taking all the worst parts of the TBS genre (butt-ugly graphics [reminiscent of an early PSone game], rage-inducing menu-driven controls, and unnecessarily complex rule structures) and combining them into a giant pile of half-assed gameplay. What completely destroys any remaining worth that this title might hold for me, though, is the ridiculously large emphasis on scouting. (How am I supposed to annihilate enemy troops and conquer a nation when I can only see what's happening on about 20% of the area of a map?) In conclusion, gaming giant 2K Games has really given their fans something to scream in agony about this time."
1,Only good for a few times,After about 3 or 4 uses the unit stopped working. Maybe it overheated. It didn't even get that hot. Total waste of money!!!
3,My Older One Was Better Quality,"I like this dehydrator. I've used one for years nearly non stop and finally the motor gave out. I wanted to buy the same one to make use of my trays and I am very happy to have it back in my kitchen, but I am disappointed in the quality of the leather and mesh trays. Both are made from thinner material and will surely end up ripping. I have my old ones and I like them much better. Also I see why people say that they have trouble with the trays breaking. They are bowed now. My old trays are flat, but the new ones bow from the center to the edge. It makes it hard to stack the trays with things on them.Don't get me wrong, I'm very happy to be dehydrating again. I am just kind of sad that they have changed the structure of the product so much."
2,Worked well and then broke after three uses,"This dehydrator worked very well. We (me and my mother) were quite pleased with it. After three uses, however, we plugged it in and it simply didn't turn on. It just simply didn't work anymore.I read other reviews of this specific dehydrator that say the same thing. I wish I read the reviews before I bought this dehydrator."
3,deficient information,All descriptions of electrical appliances should state the watts consumed and the area of shelf space. We want to buy the most efficient but only some include that information now.
4,works well for the price,i use this product rather often to make my special beef jerky...MMMMMM the product works well and has caused no concerns or troubles... the only negative comment is that is a bit under powered for Humid regions that only means longer drying times than you might expect)
2,I hope you love giving your dehydrator constant attention,"I got this dehydrator for Christams. Hurrah, homemade beef jerky! Can't wait!Except, the motor that turns everything is utterly incapable of turning. I have to nudge it, move it, bang on it between 5-20x EVERY HOUR just to keep it moving and keep the motor inside from going bad (and probably releasing that nasty electrical smoke and such!)Also, the drying time seems to be very long. It's not very powerful.THey do have a good return policy, though, and I'm getting mine replaced. I don't know why, as I suspect the new one will be the same. Ah well."
4,It's O.k,"If it were not for the directions that come with this item it would be 5 star. I had to spend a lot of time finding how to use it on the internet.I find it almost useless at this time for drying fruit.Maybe I will get some more info to help me figure out how to do that. So far after cooking bananas and apples for over 20 hours each, I still do not get the desired results.Meat (beef) however comes out the way I like it"
3,"Good....... But, can I make mine better?","The product is great, but I make deer hunt every year and make jerky for my family and friends for the holidays. I have been looking for accessories (such as: stackable adjustable trays, fruit leather sheets, and drying screens.) In my search I can't find any. I am in the process of contacting the manufacturer. I will repost my review IF I receive positive feedback from them."
5,Just the gift for a friend,"I gave this as a gift for a friend who wanted to replace a similar item which got very old but still works. I'd like to buy extra trays for this but couldn't find them. Someone could help and find them for me to buy. The dehydrator arrived on HI so quickly. As always, we get superior service through Amazon. Thank you."
1,No heat here,"The dehydrator I have been using for a long time, finally gave out. I bought this as a replacement - first the directions were sparse - didn't really tell me how to use all the parts - second,what used to take me 8 to 10 hours took me 18 and could have gone longer - there wasn't enough heat to dry the jerky - even the slices of pepperoni I put on the top tray, so I can tell which tray was on top as I rotate them, dried rubbery, not crisp. Will be replacing this soon."
3,Does the job...however....,The trays are made of #7 plastic if I knew I would not purchase this. I am an organic vegan converting to raw and it makes no sense to eat food with BPA leeched into it =(. I am going to save up for an excalibur realizing this doesn't really hold that much.
1,Wouldn't buy again,"I had never owned a food dehydrator before and used this one for the first time yesterday. It took me 18-19 hours to dry thin slices of apple. The dehydrator book I have says 6-8 hours. Plus, it didn't get hot. It got warm but not hot and after I turned it off and turned it back on the tray will not rotate and there is no troubleshoot in the directions. Would suggest trying another food dehydrator for your choice :-("
1,fan died,piece of junk. if you are serious about food drying - go for the Excalibur or something equivalent. this unit is too small and not built to last. My elite died after only two seasons of use. we use it in the fall after harvesting the garden. but not this year.
2,Functional but Noisy,"This beast does what it says it will: it dries stuff out. It's ultra-simple to use. It's fairly versatile. It also squeaks like a thousand possessed dog toys. From the very first use, the rotating trays have squeaked constantly. It's grating and annoying. If you can put this puppy in a room behind a closed, sound-proof door, you'll be good to go. If incessant squeaking would drive you carzy, I'd look for a different device."
2,everything good but bottom tray,i used mine quite a bit but bottom tray wore out where the square peg is....bottom tray no longer turns since hole is round and peg is square
3,food dehydrator,"This was a gift to my dad; he really likes it, but it took 24hrs for it to fully cook his jerky. So, if you want a dehydrator specifically for jerky & don't want to wait an entire day, get a dehydrator that has control settings on it."
5,Beautiful!,"This book has beautiful depictions of seasonal characters (Cousin Summer, Aunt Spring, etc.) The story is magical in it's description of the changing seasons. It would make a very nice gift, as well as a special addition to your child's own library. Our 3-year-old adores the story and is mesmerized by the illustrations. Definitely one of her favorites!"
3,"Enchanting Pictures, Okay Story","I will agree with the other reviewers, the illustrations in this book are amazing. Mr. Bittinger is an absolute artistic master, the figures and scenes he paints for this book represent art at its finest.I differ in opinion on the story, however, and find myself wishing that a different author had written it, or perhaps that the original story had been used instead. I found the text stilted and weak, at times a bit hackneyed in presentation - eg ""May love and happiness follow wherever you may bloom"". We may be Pagan hippies, but even I can't stand such fluffy (and badly edited) writing. For this reason, I haven't brought myself to buy this book yet, we'll be enjoying it from the library until I decide if I can stand to read it over and over, as will be the case with our little man."
5,Root Children book review,I adore this book; the illustrations are fabulous and story is very sweet. There's even a lovely little song at the end.
3,Sound Quality Issues,"I heard Sylvester Weaver on a bottleneck blues sampler and thought the performance was terrific, so I bought this album. I guess the tune on the sampler had been remastered. This album features the performances as issued. The sound quality on many of the tunes is really bad (hiss, etc.). I still think Sylvester Weaver was great, and you probably have to expect this, but to me it makes it a lot harder to enjoy the music."
3,Its OK,"Bought this to use with my Motorola W385. I liked its quality, but I personally didn't care for how my W385 fit into it that much. I ended up giving the case to my mother-in-law for her LG UX145 which fit in it perfectly so it wasn't a complete loss."
2,Good looking but not durable.,This thing is nice looking but thats it when it comes to durability it feel apart after less that a week.
5,Smallest Show on Earth is a big winner,"The Smallest Show on Earth is a great film. I saw this movie forty years ago and it has all the heart and humor I remember. A ""must see"" for anyone who loves old classics. Sellers and Rutherford are splendid. Bob Ebinger"
5,The Smallest Show on Earth,"Leonard Maltin calls this movie ""Charming and hilarious"". Our library had this one on VHS in our old building. Now in our new building, I'm glad to provide some lighthearted fare for our DVD fans!"
1,save your money,"This piece of junk worked fine 3 times. Since I don't deep-fry that often, I used it over a 2 month period. The 4th try, it was inoperative. The best part is Amazon, the dealer, Target, and the maker, Aroma, would not honor a guarantee after 30 days. I suggest you save your cash and do not buy any product from this company"
2,I do not think so,I purchased this item for a friend because I borrowed hers in which she had for over 8 years and sure enough it stopped working while I was using it. Would I buy this? NO! but I had to replace it for her because she preferred the same one. But I must say that while it was working for me the first two fries it cooked evenly.
5,Ministry of Caring Workbook,This book was very good on the subject of Ministry of Caring. Alot of good information on the subject.
2,More like gossip than wisdom,"Talk show host Larry King's book opens with a foreword written by the surgeon who performed a bypass operation on him. Unfortunately, Mr. King's book reads more like a penance for past sins than a book about heart disease. If you need company to wallow in regret over the excesses of the American lifestyle, this may be the book for you. But if you're searching for something new about heart disease that doesn't just echo the conventional line delivered by your neighborhood family doctor or bypass surgeon, don't look in Mr. King's book.As a man in the popular media, you'd expect Mr. King to have a sixth sense regarding what is truly newsworthy. Mr. King's book may have been newsworthy in 1980, but in 2004 it is little more than a personal catharsis."
4,Unsung Voices,"In regards to my last review of Dec.14,2001 of other great artists, not mentioned, this r&b set also should have mentioned or added more discs including other ballads from Blue Magic and The Persuaders, these blue eyed soul artists should have been included also in this set, such as The Young Rascals, Nino Tempo and April Stevens, The Rose Garden, Bent Fabric, Dusty Springfield, Herbie Mann, Delaney & Bonnie & Friends, Dr. John, Iron Butterfly, The shadows of Knight, Vanilla Fudge, Derrick and the Dominoes, Lulu, and Average White Band. Keep on ""Soulin on"". Joey Hoffman"
5,Held off buying this too long!,"Looked at this CD for years without buying - When I finally did, well worth the purchase - The sound quality is great and the music is without peer - Don't wait, buy!!!"
5,Atlantic R&B review,"We received our order in excellent condition, and in a timely manner,using the free delivery option. We are well pleased with this greatcollection of classic R&B; recordings from the great artists of the40's, 50's, 60's & 70's."
4,Lots of memories,This 8 CD set is a treasure trove of good memories. The box set is durable and the book inside that details the singers/groups and their music and influence is excellent and is well written. Now you know where Casey Kasem got some of his info on his radio shows.
2,more hits,"ps atlantic please make more cd sets.put other great artists on them like, cerrone,michael walden,stacey lattisaw, chic, shannon,clubhouse,nu shooz,changefeaturing luther vandross,the jimmy castor bunch, black heat,manu dibango,sister sledge, patty&the lovelites brook benton donna summer ,more more more more, thanx joey hoffman jhh52757"
2,Out of paper and Yellow ink,"I have had this printer for just over a month. I agree with two of the previous reviews that the paper tray will eventually get to the place where it consistently will not feed...ANY kind of paper, letter sized or photo. The monitor reads ""out of paper"" I phoned HP's ""under warranty"" help line and the agent walked me through everything, the printer kept saying ""out of paper"" for BOTH trays. Plugging and unplugging and other testing processes for over an hour on the phone accomplished nothing. Finally today,1/20/06 I was told by first an agent, then a supervisor, that I could have a new machine, BUT not until the 4th of April, 2006. The machines are on ""Back order"". Obviously, this means a wait of 2 months. Oh yes, the yellow cartridge was the first to go..last week. Would I buy this machine again? NO!"
2,HP has discontinued this product,"When mine had an irretrievable paper jam and I took it in for repair, we found out that HP has discontinued both the printer and the pieces (gear replacement) needed for (a relatively simple) repair. Shame, shame, H.P. You just lost my business for good."
2,HP 3210 Out of Paper message,"After fighting with this thing for the last year I'm about to pass it on to GoodWill. Seriously. It doesn't matter what paper, what size, nothing, but after a few months of use actually getting output is almost impossible(this *is* what this thing is for, I believe). The always present ""Out of paper"" message is starting to raise my blood pressure and I'm looking for another printer and it's not an HP.Reading a previous review about the same issue it appears that it's a software issue, but HP apparently has no plans to correct it; isn't that grand? Am I pissed off? You bet I am; this isn't one of those $49.95 printers - it was rather pricey. It'll be a cold day in Hell before I purchase another product from these HP."
1,NOT RECOMMENDED !!!!,"I hate to admit it, but I have to agree with most of the other reviewers on this product. The paper loading problems are real - being careful or gentle has nothing to do with it. We have had a half dozen other printers previously (non-HPs) without anywhere near the problems.About 6 months after the warranty expired, the printer totally failed. Customer Service informed me that there is no repair option, but would gladly sell me a refurb or new one in exchange. NO THANK YOU!!Not at all what I expected from HP, especially because this was not a cheap printer. I regret purchasing this HP product and will be replacing it with another brand."
1,Don't buy this printer!,"I've lost count of the number of HP Printers I have purchased. Always been thrilled with them. Great products. In just over a year (warranty just expired!), I'm now getting the ""Load Paper Error"" and it won't feed paper. From the looks of it, the design of this printer is a lemon. HP needs to do something about this...I would have rated it 0 stars, but I had to rate it a least 1."
1,Load Paper Error,"I used this printer probably 5 times over the course of the first couple of months that I owned it. After that period, paper no longer feeds and it constantly has the ""Load Paper"" error that so many others experience. It is virtually useless."
1,STAY AWAY!!!!!!!!!,"THIS IS AN EXTREMELY TEMPERMENTAL PRODUCT! It contstantly jams. The paper tray is too small to put much paper in at a time, which is annoying, and the tray itself is set up so that it is jammed way into the machine, so that when it does jam, often, it is impossible to clear. It also is prone to ""carriage jam"" - and there is no available help with the carriage set up, there is no photo of the carriage set up anywhere on the internet.I HATE this machine!!!"
1,JUNK!!!!!! Don't buy.,"USB connection doesn't work so I had to network unit thru router. CRAZY!@$#@#$!!! Software is useless, also connot operate using push buttons. I have spent at least 6 hours on phone with tech support in India. I wished that I had returned this POS while I still could! Now I stuck with a $330.00 boat anchor. Please take away the star I gave it."
1,useless,As per my previos e-mails to amazon......THIS ITEM ARRIVED IN PEICES. iT HAD NOT BEEN PACKED AT ALL. wRAPED VERY LOOSLEY IN BUBBLE WRAP ONLY. I HAVE BEEN DEVISTATED BY THIS LOSS. I HAVE WANTED AND NEEDED THIS PARTICULAR PRINTER.....NONE OF MY QUESTIONS HAVE BEEN ANSWERED. THIS ITEM CAME BY USPS THE WHOLE END OF THE BOX WAS MASHED IN AND THE WHOLE SIDE OF THE COMPUTER WAS IN SMALL PEICES. ALL PLASTIC PARTS BROKEN. IT IS TOTALLY USELESS AND UNFIXABLE. IT SIMPLY BANGED AROUND IN THE BOX...........VERY DISSAPPOINTED......
1,Completely unusable,"Echoing many other reviews here, this printer really makes nice prints...when it works. The quality of the photos we've printed was excellent, along with non-photo materials. However, it's now become unusable. After the seemingly inevitable ""out of paper"" messages started appearing, we could get jobs printed by reloading the paper tray, but now seem to be unable to do even that.Incredibly disappointing, and coming on the heels of problems with the iPaq 1955 I'm ready to swear off anything HP forever. DO NOT BUY!!!"
1,"Promises much, delivers nothing","This printer has some great features, not least of which is the two sided printing, which is such a good idea it is difficult to understand why it's not a standard feature on all printers.What a shame then that the HP photosmart 3210 doesn't actually work. I'm on my 3rd machine in less than 2 months, and that is going straight back to the store tomorrow, still in the box, for a refundYes, there are some glowing reviews for this machine, but, and call me a cynic if you will, I can only imagine that they must have been posted by HP public relations staff. It's either that or I m actually in a coma and my life up to this point is in fact just a dream, or rather, as far as my experience with this product goes, a nightmare.Forewarned is forearmed - don't buy it."
1,HP should get out of the scanner business,"As a copier and printer this porduct is very good but as a scanner it is the worst. It is slow, the scans are exteremly bad and the software just does not work. I have been using hundreds if soft ware over 35 years and HP just should quit."
2,PAPER JAM SUCKS!!!,"JUST MY OPINIONHI ALL, DO NOT BUY THIS PRINTER. I have own mine for about 2 1/2 years; and lately it is not stop paper jams or wrong size. Error messages.It was a once an a while deal, but now I can not count on it. Note I have changed paper stock several times and with only HP paper. I have maybe ran 1500 sheets of paper and maybe 80-100 photos. BUT and I mean BUT a good 1/3 of the paper were paper jam. WHEN this printer works, it works well; BUT TO MANY PAPER JAM. I believe for the amount of paper ran through it; it is not old; just by the age. DO NOT BUY!!!!!! AN FOR YOU HP I WANT A NEW PRINTER!! FOR FREE OR I LEAST I BE WILLING TO PAY FOR SHIPPING. thank you for your time. you no believe me; check the internet for the complaint; it affects this unit as a whole."
3,won't print if color cartridge is empty,Ok printer but... it refuses to print black-only if one of the color cartridges is empty.
1,Seems they produced this product before they finished designing it !,"I owned an HP printer before this one and loved it--until after about 1 1/2 yrs.and it began to have its own set of problems. I cannot begin to convey how much I dislike this printer, which had all the features that I really wanted. It sounds like most of you have been luckier than I have, because right off the bat mine had a paper jam. I never, I mean Never, print even one page without pressing the O.K. button once, twice or even three times. I always have the paper tray full, so until I read all the customer reviews, I thought I must be doing something wrong. It is very slow, loud, and even vibrates at times. My printer is truly a piece of junk - would throw it in the trash except that I plan to get my money back. Wish I could have something positive to say."
1,I AM ON MY 2ND ONE,"When I had my first printer, my husband and I were blown away by the photo printing quality. Then, when I tried print on regular paper, and the screen said I was out of paper....Then, I tried to print envelopes...again it said I was out of paper. HP tech support said this had been his 10TH PHONE CALL THAT DAY reguarding the printer saying it was out of paper when it it not. So I exchanged this for a new one. Well.....same deal same error message. I will NOT be exchanging this for another HP. I am getting a CANON."
2,"Piece of junk, do not buy","First one packed up after 10 days, during the routine maintenance which seems to trigger every few pages of printing, so got a replacement from the store.Now I am stuck with the second one which always fails to feed the paper. Should have read those reviews before..."
2,Paper Tray Empty,"My only complaint is that I am unable to print anything. After 4 1/2 weeks of perfect pictures, reports, every media imaginable - I am now unable to print. Always reads Paper tray empty. I have sat on the phone with HP Support for 30+ minutes trying to remedy the problem. I was finally told that I must be using inferior paper. (What does that mean?) I will return this printer today. This is my 2nd 3210 - the first one had fatal ink error and would not load the software."
1,0 stars if possible..I hate this printer,"I hate this printer. Plain and simple this is a turd. a $[...] piece of crap.Yes..like many others I too have had endless paper problems. I CANNOT get the paper to feed properly. Even after following advice here.ok..so my 3-in-1 printer is now only a 2-in-1. I long since put this piece of crap in the closet only to now need it's scanning abilities. So I pull out my HP 3210 printer. Go to HP and download the correct drivers..plug it in and hope to start some scanning with my 3-1..*cough*...no 2-1 HP.Guess what? Drivers lock up system. HP application locks up and repeatedly crashes. CNTL-ALT-DEL wont even work while this HP crap is on my computer. 5 trys..5 reboots..I give up. I deleted the HP crap software and Windows XP system is running perfectly again.I hate this HP 3210 printer. I detest it. I hate the HP software. I want to take this piece of junk to the shooting range and go crazy like in the movie ""Office Space""."
1,Unreliable,"This printer is capable of producing high quality documents. But it frequently jams and requires surgery through the back door to get out tiny scraps of paper. Often I have to lift open the top door to get at the ink injector which gets hung up with paper also. The printer crimps the top left corner of every document.The scanner function works well and I have had no problems there.The fax capability is poorly laid out and has never worked.Overall, whatever cost you pay is not worth the frustration. I would spend my money elsewhere."
3,Printer feeder issues,"I have had this printer a few years. When I first received it, I had to send it back because it wouldn't grab the paper.Over the years, I have put up with the issue of misfed paper (about every 5-10 sheets). It will grab 2 sheets at a time, slightly offset, and print. This is particularly troublesome when trying to print double-sided (everything gets messed up, and you have to start your printing project over). I am amazed to see how much is charged for this printer, considering some of the reviews I have read.I was looking to buy a replacement; the feeder finally broke all together, and keeps jamming the paper inside the machine. I was hoping to find it much cheaper, since it is an older version of the the HP all-in-one; so that I could use all the print cartridges I have for it, but NO WAY would I put out that kind of money.All in all it has been a decent printer, but it's time to move on."
1,Miserable Printer from the depths of Hell,"This machine has brought nothing but misery since I purchased it. It continually experiences from paper feed problems which results in the machine eating up paper like a rottweiler.But the BIGGEST problem is that the machine simply dies after a while, with the printer screen stating that there is an ""ink system failure"".After speaking to HP who are useless with a capital ""U"", they were even baffled with this common problem. But what they are sure of is that if it's out of warranty they won't help.For an extensive list of complaints about this printer, just head over to Amazon.co.uk and search for this product, where over 90 percent of the reviews complain about the same problem, yet HP still refuses to acknowledge there is anything wrong with this product.PLEASE STAY AWAY FROM THIS MACHINE!"
1,Load Paper Problem - Headache,"This printer must have missed some step during the QA phase, since everyone who purchases it has the same problem. The damb thing won't load plain paper off the main tray.I called HP and they are aware of an issue with this and blame this on a firmware problem that they will repair. This is hard to believe since it looks to be a hardware issue. Regardless, my unit pass the return date at Staples so they offered to send a refurb, but then realized there is a 42 day back order on refurbs (a lot of complaints). The manager then called me back and offered to send me a new unit within 5 days and this was acceptable. Not sure how the new one will fair, but I'm sure someone will be getting my returned unit as a refurb soon enough.Go with another printer and save yourself a headache."
4,Works fine!,"I have had this printer for 2 years. I have not had any paper feed problems! Color pictures come out very nice. Now if you are looking for professional quality prints, go to a professional. I don't use the scan feature, so I can't comment on that. I did not have any problems with the set up (use windows xp). No problems with networking either. My only complaint(which is why I give it 4 stars) is the cost of the ink. Printing a lot of photos is not cost effective. However, the individual ink cartridges (this feature is why I bought this model)do help keep the cost down. This printer has not let me down. Very reliable printer."
2,not up to expectations,"Scanning and printing photos is much lower quality than I expected for the price and features of the machine. Document printing is quick, however it takes 30 seconds to calibrate your first page, which knocks the 32 ppm down to 16 ppm or so."
2,Unreliable Drivers,"I won't go into details on my specific experiences, but I'll chime in with those that have complained about the software. It's bloated, containing about 5 different programs that all pretty much get you to the same place. It's unhealthy in that I often find myself having to kill HP processes while I'm shutting down and they take entirely too long to start up. Worst of all it's unreliable. I want to print when I want to print. I don't want to have to reboot or futz around with configurations to get the printer to stop giving me errors.The hardware is solid which is the only reason it gets more than one star when I'm going to throw it away while it still works just to get rid of my software problems. It's a real shame.Oh yea, and the replacement will probably *not* be an HP."
5,"Nice, very nice","Setup this printer with a wireless router and installed the software across a mixed (3 Macs/1PC) network and it was immediately up a running. Accepted printing and scanning from the remote computers. Only problem was trying to print to the lower photo tray from iPhoto on the Macs.After checking out the documentation and online stuff, had to call HP tech support. The tech knew exactly what I was talking about and acknowledged that the info is not in the manual. But he walked me through the process and, as we spoke, sent me an email with directions. ""Problem"" solved.We love this printer."
1,Paper Feeder Issue...still unresolved,"I bought the HP Photosmart 3210 about 6 months ago. The print quality, scanning function, and copy funtion all passed with flying colors. However, those qualities come second to actually having the printer function as expected. I too started having a paper feed problem (as you can see from many, many of the reviews). I am now on my THIRD replacement (remanufactured) printer...and still having the same ""out of paper"" error when the paper tray is full. It takes me about 30-90 seconds to print one page, if the printer decides to accept the paper you put in the paper tray. I have come to the conclusion that the HP front loading paper technology has some apparent flaws. I just gave up on getting the FOURTH replacement printer offered by HP and bought a comparable Epson. I am sticking with the top-loading paper technology that I know actually works."
2,very unreliable,"1. Printer started scrunching the paper. called HP and they sent me a kit to fix the problem. (overnight service, great!). Anyway, I re-installed the drivers in windows XP, and the problem went away, so I never tried the kit. Their support has no clue.2. Printer won't print and says there is no yellow ink. (All the other inks are still around 100%). I don't believe that the yellow ran out so much faster then the rest. Now, the printer won't print/copy at all. Even in black and white, since it needs the yellow ink. Also, I can't just buy yellow. According to the support, the stuff they sell as replacements is different then what came with the printer, and I can't mix them. So, now I need to spend almost $80.00 on 6 new ink cartrages even though 5 of them are at 100%!!!. I used to really like HP printers, but this is probably the last I buy."
1,Had to give it one star...,"Had to give it one star BECAUSE THERE IS NOTHING LOWER.This printer was the answer to my printing dreams. For about three months, with LIGHT home use. Only fault at that time is it is LOUD. It will wake the dead. Which is OK, since the DEAD don't have to print things that often, this is the perfect printer for them...Other than noise, a faulty ""load paper"" error kept coming up.Then, the paper load went bad. It is very unreliable, and ink cartridges run out VERY QUICKLY and cost about 10 bucks a pop,Tonight, I'm trashing it. Buying ANOTHER printer tonight!DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS PIECE OF TRASH!"
1,Avoid this printer!,"Do you want to print photos? CAD images? How about a multi-page PDF? Well, if so, then avoid this printer. Yes, such simple tasks will not be possible. It has so little memory (just a guess) that it fails on nearly everything I send to it. As well, the same trouble with paper misfeeds, etc. you read about below are entirely true."
1,too many problems,Good prints but mine grabs multiple pages (wastes a tons of pages) and ink runs out way too fast! Clearly HP is in the ink business not the printer business.
1,Don't buy this printer,"This printer has proven to be one of the worst I've worked with. It constantly wastes paper by printing a document halfway several times until it decides to finally correct itself. Also, I was excited about having the separate ink choices. When I went to print something in blue - it said I needed to replace the pink cartridge before I could print in ANY color. That is so ridiculous. I am mad at myself for spending money on a printer that is such a piece of JUNK."
2,Peter Williams,"Had the unit for about 6 months now with low to moderate usage and these are my impressions:Irritatingly noisy for several minutes every time turned on.Every other time it's turned on the machine is down for 2-3minutes doing ""maintenance"".Scanning is poor.Document printing is barely acceptable.Photo colors are off and so far I have found no way to adjust.Goes thru yellow ink like crazy.Having a home copier is nice but I don't feel it's worththe trade-off in quality of the other functions.My advice: don't buy."
1,"Oh, HP, where did you go wrong?","Your products used to be great, but now, to judge by the HP 3210, they're simply awful. As others have noted, they seem to be designed for maximum ink consumption, and replacement of all cartridges can cost $80. This printer wastes paper too, as other reviewers have noted. It is constantly ""performing maintenance"" when you want to print. Working with it is so clunky and unpleasant that I have pretty much given up printing altogether. If this is what printers are like now, I don't want another one and god knows I'll never buy another HP anything."
5,The Ten Commandments are what our laws are based on in the modern world today!,"I chose this 5 Star rating because this film is an epic film in a scope and size that they don't make anymore and will never make again. Charlton Heston was in my opinion, one of the all time greatest actors and did many of the stunts in his films himself.I love this film because it shows God's love for His chosen people and how he chose to bring them out of slavery.I would recommend this film to anyone who respects great films and has a interest in history, the bible and Yahweh."
3,"Smooth, varied and complex","The Problem with Towa is that he is too complex for some ears. Using a variety of styles and mixes he crafts some of the finest aural candy around. People can be put off by the compexity and variety, be careful."
2,dreary,"After his fine debut, Towa Tei shows he doesn't have much melodic skill with Sound Museum. Don't be fooled: this is easy listening sludge."
2,big disappointment after such a brilliant first album,"I couldn't help but expect a lot from Towa Tei's new album since I had been so positively impressed by ""Future Listening"", his first CD, mixing with grace and talent Brazilian classics, Japanese pop, Indian influences and hip-hop/house beats. His new album is listenable but lack the inventivity that pleased me so much in ""Future Listening"". Too bad."
5,Really excellent - recommended,"We've had this for about six months and we love it. We use it a lot - mainly for smoothies and blended fruit drinks, but we've also made iced coffee, which involves crushing ice, and I frequently blend pancake batter to make it smoother. We also have some of the accessories and have used them to make milkshakes, crush nuts and do some basic food processing. We have had NO problems with this item during its frequent use; it works well, cleans up very easily, and looks fabulous on the benchtop! We stored it away for a while but I missed it being out so now it's out permanently and is a great addition to the kitchen. Highly recommended!"
4,Great for Smoothies,"My 23 and 21 year old love this machine. Great action for smoothies. Only occasionally will some fruit remain stuck at the bottom and they'll have to stop, stir and restart to get the item pulverized."
3,Disappointed,I really loved the series and I'm glad they at least included the un broadcasted episode (net only at the time) BUT there's nothing else. A few extras would have been nice for those of us who watched
5,Don't own the DVD...,"But have seen the series on Xfinity Streampix and was REALLY surprised when I heard that this show was cancelled. I thought to myself, ""What the hell is up with this?"" after getting/having so much hype being compared to Batman it only lasts a season?? Makes no sense! Unfortunately I didn't ever see this show when it aired on TV (actually forgot about it) then I started to download the show (HDTV Rips (Naturally)) and was just blown away at how awesome it was! lol This show should be brought back!"
4,Shouldn't have been cancelled,"this show took a while to find its footing. a genre show like this needs to catch attention very quickly to survive. unfortunately the first episode plays out like a 45 minute 'previously on' segment and the next couple of episodes, while they are better, can still feel a little clumsy and inconsequential. they at least serve as a decent introduction to the universe though, and make the later episodes, starting with the two-part ""the lich,"" very compelling. unfortunately, the show was already dead by the time it got there. I wish shows like this were given more time to find an audience, or at least get a second chance on cable. as NBC cut the original order of 13 episodes down to 10 mid-season (and only aired 9 of them) the finale doesn't get a chance to offer much in terms of closure. that said, if you're looking for a solid super hero show, pick this up or check it out on Netflix."
3,Smaller than it appears,My daughter bought this thinking it was a lot bigger than it was. Look at the specifications before you buy. These are like the small plastic animals you can buy at Michael's.
5,"Pastor Kee, this is such a joy to behold.","I recommend this album with my whole heart. It is such a blessing to hear such great music live, redone in a joyfull way. I just saw this album in the store, not even knowing it was out. As I always do I just pick up anything with John P. Kee on the title. His ministry always brings such a great blessing into my life.This project is no exception.The 3 skits with sister Bernice really cracked me up.This album is a must have for all John P.Kee fans. It is also a great album for anyone who just loves good gospel music.Pick it up and rejoice in the Lord through music."
2,too much talk,"Good graphics, plot is similar to many others. The problem is the constant talking, this movie did not need so much background on the characters. Can't say much more, I do not want to ruin it in case you like it."
4,good movie ..and very good 3d,"very good 3d effects..good movie, same old sea moster, big slimmy ugly with 100 of teeth..u know the tipical creather..howevery the dialog was good and story line easy to follow..i did like the 3d effects"
1,Sector nil,The only problem with amazon review is that I have to rate this movie at all. One star is way too much for this movie. CGI is still in the mid 80s and the storyline is at best laughable. The actors at least have got a monster made of petrol to compare their acting with. Don't waste your time.
2,BLAH,"Drawn out without purpose. Took so long for monster to show up that I got bored. Would have been fine is characters where developed more. Out of the blue, it shows up and I didn't care by then. Some moments, but overall a cheesy movie. 3D was ok to decent. TV movie. Says no rating, but it's a light PG-13."
3,SECTOR WASTEBASKET,"There was enough here to keep my interest for maybe a half hour but the effects were sloppy, heavy handed drama mixed with hammy comedic moments and some serious over acting. The creature sucked as well - and I don't mean that in the horrific horror movie sense.About on par with a mediocre SyFy channel clunker. There was more potential here. Production and directorial mismanagement probably kept this from becoming something worthwhile.Save your money for something good unless you're a completist and just have to add this to your Korean horror collection."
4,Already bought the Hong Kong 3D+2D blu-ray released on 2/23 but...,"""Sector 7"" delivers some nice monster mayhem and a decent story too. I couldn't wait until June to buy this decent South Korean monster film on blu-ray. I ordered the region ""A"" Hong Kong 3D+2D blu-ray that was released on February 23. Nice transfer. Good film. Good special effects. I haven't watched the 3D version on the Hong Kong blu-ray yet to comment about it. If you enjoy films like ""The Host"", ""Troll Hunter"", ""Attack The Block"", ""Monsters"", ""Chaw"", ""Cloverfield"", ""Super 8"", ""The Mist"", ""The Relic"", ""Mimic"" and other good creature features, then you enjoy ""Sector 7"" as well. By the way, I am also going to buy this blu-ray version of the film to support Shout! Factory and to support South Korean Cinema as well. Buy this film. You will not be disappointed. Highly Recommended!!!"
3,Typical Korean Sci-Fi,This movie was your basic Korean sci-fi movie. The acting and plot were very straight forward and typical.The special effects were average and nothing to write home about. I found the movie watchable and would recommend it to a die hard low/mid budget sci-fi fan.
4,A ticked-off alien running amok aboard a ship - South Korean style!,"Compared to 'Alien' for good reason, this South Korean mega-hit (and the first film to be released in Korea in both 3D and Imax) has, as its setting, an oil drilling rig set way out to see off the coast of Korea, in sector 7. For a long time now, the drilling for offshore oil has not been going well, but when a skeletal crew is left behind to give it one last try, said crew inadvertently unleashes a very (okay, VERY) nasty creature that starts showing them what happens when you ""f"" around with someone's quiet time. Great action sequences, really strong CGI (that only falters in a couple of spots, otherwise very realistic), and the exact dollop of humor mixed in with the action-terror make this one I really wish I HAD seen in 3D. And DAMN can that creature even BE killed?!?"
4,I love ha ji won so this is a great movie it was well done.,This was close copy of alien; but it is very enjoyable. I like Korean shows better than 90% of the American made shows.The Korean's tend to develop the story line so much better than our shows.
1,SUCKS,"simply put, the baton isn't what was pictured, its cheap as heck, DON'T BUY IT, at least buy something 10dollars and up! this thing looked like a little TOY... DO NOT BUY!"
5,Excellent Resource,"""Aikido, the arts of self-defense"" by Ko√¨ichi Tohei. Well written and presented. It is an excellent resource for anyone interested in or studying Aikido."
5,Perfect Order,Boston Red Sox New England Patriots State of Champions PinThis order arrived in a timely fashion and in mint condition.
3,HP 92/93 ink cartridges,"Black ink cartridge seems to be fine and has a 2011 expiration date. It was in original packaging. The color cartridge however, arrived in only the inner package. To make matters worse, it has a Sept. 2008 expiration date on it. It may still be OK. If not I will contact the company. I don't think I will do business with this company again."
3,Not what I ordered,"I did not receive the exact item I ordered - HP92/93 Combo Pack with Vivera Ink Print Cartridge. Instead I received a 92/93 Combo Pack with no mention of Vivera Ink. The side of the package I received says ""NEW FORMULA: Twice as durable"". I have not yet installed it so I really don't know if it is as good as the original or not. Although I purchased the item throught Amazon, Amazon was not the supplier; the supplier did not offer any information about the substitution."
2,Poor Quality,"I was disappointed in this product. The fit and finish is very poor, for example the edges of the enclosure don't exactly meet. The winding mechanism flexes and I don't expect it to last long. I suggest you avoid this product."
1,Failed on my Mac,"The seller said it would work on a Mac. It does not work on a Mac.I recently switched to Mac and was hoping that this product worked. On the case of the disk it says its for Windows 98, 95, and NT 4.0 compatible, also it says it on the disk. Someone is misleading on this product."
4,"Excellent book - But it could use a ""cosmetic"" update","Good subject coverage, knowledgeable author, and plenty of uncluttered figures makes this book very worthwhile. The only thing missing from this excellent book is an update. Although this is the third edition (1998), almost all of the equipment photographs are from the early-to-mid 1970's. An extensive and broad Suggested Reading section follows most chapters but again far far too many references are to early 1970's books and manuals. An update could earn this book a 5+ rating."
2,Not the right edition,It took a couple of weeks to receive the book. I ordered the fourth edition but received the second edition. I'll probably just keep the book because my class already started.
4,All of Jenny Burton's 80s LP are great - but where is the CD?!,"While I'm glad that Rhino/Atlantic saw fit to (finally) reissue Jenny Burton's third LP, Souvenirs (1986) digitally, it would have been nice to have a physical CD with improved sound and bonus tracks/mixes, rather than simply a cheap mp3 release. Wounded Bird reissued her debut LP ""In Black and White"" (1983) a few years ago, so I had hoped they would do the same for Burton's s/t 1985 LP, as well as this one - since they are all solid, consistent efforts, even if she gradually loses her underground electro edge in a bid for mainstream crossover R&B/soul commercial success in later LPs. Throughout, is that amazing VOICE."
4,Avon Items,"I have been able to locate several Avon items I have purchased over the years, but not all I wished to learn about were in this book. Still, I am satisfied with the purchase."
4,The Seventeenth Edition,"As a whole it is fantastic. But, by not listing the men's by name, such as ""Leather""; it caused me a lot of time and trouble trying to find it."
2,Only for historical perspective,"Most of these movies are old banal movies whose only notable feature is that the young peter Sellers was in them. I am glad I bought them, but I am addicted to his work. If you are not please don't waste your money. If you are, you'll be glad you did."
3,IF YOU CAN GET PAST THE DATED DIALOG,"This is not great literature. The leading lady made me want to slap her in the beginning and a little at the end as well. But in all fairness so did the leading man. The first time I read this, in my very early teens, I thought it was thrilling having to flee a country for you life and find love along the way. But, I was a rather silly teen. Now that I am nolonger a silly teen, I realize this is a very good outline for what could have been a great story. With some very clever cleaning up it could make a great action chic flick. It puts me in the mind of romancing the stone.And if how often I stated I was a silly teen got on your nerves in this short review, you are gonna hate this book or laugh you buns off. Cause there is a lot of similar repeation in this book. I liked it the first time, as a silly teen, the reread gave me a good laugh at my former self."
1,Waste 'O Money,"Beware!!! I ignored the first review and thought ""How bad can it be?!"" Trust me, the first reviewer was too kind!!! The IQue 3600 is a great device but is very complex and one of the most poorly documented electronic products I have owned BUT this DVD will add nothing to your understanding."
5,"Do you like fantasy, adventure, and excitment?","...Then this is the book for you! Kendra Kandlestar and the Box of Whispers (what a mouthful!) is about The Box Whispers, the most precious treasure in the land of Een, stolen by some mystical creature that somehow fell through the ""Magic Curtain"" which hides this mystical land. To save the book 5 heroes are chosen to go through the curtain in search for the box, including young Kendra and Oki.Exciting and filled with fantastic creatures, this book deserves a nine out of ten and a good summer read award from yours truly!"
4,Magic and Mythical,"I love the variation of mythical and magical creatures. It's funny and full of suprises every step of the way, just like Artemis Fowl but better."
5,Loved the Book,I stayed up all night reading Kendra Kandlestar and the Box of Whispers. I couldn't stop reading. It was a great book. I love the detail. It definitely brought it to life. I find the idea interesting because everyone kind of has a box of whispers of there own. Some people choose to open it and some choose to keep it locked.
2,ATTRACTIVE/NOT COMFORTABLE,"I was delighted with the speedy receipt of my Amazon order, however, I had to return this item. The shoe was attractive and stylish but did not feel comfortable on my feet.The texture was hard and uncomfortable to walk in."
5,Orchid Growing basics,As a complete beginner I found this DVD an excellent introduction to what I should be doing and what I should start with. Everything is explained simply and it shows how easy it is to grow these amazing plants.
2,bad quality DVD,"The introduction is good but when the information is given, I have to turn the volume all the way up and still can not hear what is said. Please help solve this problem"
4,A MOST PLEASANT READ,"What a pleasure, in today's traumatic world, to be able to get comfortable in your recliner and have a ""good"" read about ""normal people"" who tackle some of the same problems you and your lady friends have faced from time to time. This book reminds me of the ones my mother's book club read in the 1930's before ""Forever Amber"" came on the market and caused such a ""splash"".This was back when Faith Baldwin wrote such good stories, ones that held your attention and about good people who ""just did the best they could"" and did it with grace. I am looking forward to this writer's ""follow up"" story."
5,Absolutely wonderful!,"I recommend this book to all who want an exciting, easy reading book, and one of good moral content (which is hard to find now days)! I cannot tell you the different times while I was reading Chasing Memories, that I was brought me to tears. Putting myself in Laura's place, I found myself crying and thanking God that I am able to remember my darling husband, my children and all of my beautiful grandchildren! For being able to recall my precious parents and Grandparents who had a great influence in my life and all of the friends in I have now and past. I am not through with it yet but I assure you that this is a gem of a book for anyone who loves good, wholesome, family reading! V.K.S."
3,A single guy captures his lamb,"There is a certain borderline dementia to this moviethat is very unhealthy in a British way?This old fellow tricks/ blackmails his young administrative assistant/ secretaryinto a week of four day at his flat.What may be bad about this movie, is that it might give others ""ideas"" abouthow to prey on young women?As it stands it is kind of innocent in content.I didn't really like it much."
3,"Great movie, very poor DVD quality.","Please read other reviews for analysis of the movie, these comments pertain to the DVD version. This is an uncut, uncensored version and is not the same as the video rental. This is not pointed out anywhere on the box. With a great movie such as Stripes, more might be considered better. Voyeurs may appreciate the increased nudity on display. However, the inclusion of shots that did not go through the finishing process continually disrupts the suspension of disbelief. Grainy close-ups alternate with pin-sharp group shots. Look for the glaring continuity errors as Bill Murray goes AWOL. How does something this sloppy get released on DVD? I expect a 'Collectors Edition' will be released to an unsuspecting public that cleans up the mistakes evident in this version. Not the first time movie fans have been forced to buy multiple copies of the same thing!"
2,Stripes: sophomoric humor at its medium...,"In The Simpsons, Sideshow Bob has a tendency to step on rakes with his big feet, crashing the handle into his face. The sound he utters is a kind of a vocal shudder: ""ahrhbbbahrhbbbbahrhbbbbbahrhbbbbbahrhbbb.""I felt like repeating this throughout the movie.In Stripes, Bill Murray joins the US Army. He makes it through boot camp with his ""reject authority"" attitude, then gets sent to Europe where, of course, everybody else is stupid. At times, he gives you that Caddyshack ""lip droop""; otherwise he's just smirking, joking, and being sarcastic.This was pretty sophomoric throughout. Lots of sex jokes, partial nudity, army officers are all stupid, yada yada.Stripes might have started off Bill Murray's movie career, but this one should have gotten him a Golden Raspberry Award (""Razzie""). Now John Candy showed some serious comedic acting. Go John!Want a comedy in the ""boot camp changes a person"" genre? TryIn the Army Now."
2,Amusing spoof of basic training,"This movie is one of the funniest spoofs of the military aside from ""Private Benjamin"" that you can get. My father used to be a drill sargeant so he finds this movie to be a real scream. He always shakes his head at the recruits singing that do-wadd-ditty song on their way out from getting their uniforms. And Warren Oates performance as Sgt. Hulka isn't such a far cry from the real thing...my dad would attest to this. All in all, this movie should be viewed on cable to save yourself from unneccessary nudity and a few foul words...while this movie would not make it on my top 100 list, it does rank up there with amusing comedies of all time. Haven't viewed DVD yet, but Wal-Mart had this for 9.44 in case any one is interested....."
1,bill has finally disappoited me.,Ive always been able to say Bill Murrays movis are great. but now I say MOST of ill murrays movies are great. this movie is compeletly inapporpite. its a movie with a lot of nudity and jokes about our country. awful. if your going to see a bill murray movie see what about bob?. leave this one on the shelf to build up dust froever.just look at the front cover and sick joke AND mockery of out coutry all in one. look the lauge is horrible.
4,Singing Doo-Wah-Diddy...,"This service comedy is probably Bill Murray's first successful starring vehicle(""Meatballs"" was intermittently humorous but doesn't have the sustained laughs of ""Stripes""). The story is essentially about an iconoclast who enlists in the Army to get structure in his life but finds himself running afoul of the authority figures. Murray is surrounded by an excellent cast(Harold Ramis, John Candy, Judge Reinhold, Warren Oates, P.J. Soles, Sean Young, John Larroquette, and John Voldstad a.k.a Darrell from the old ""Newhart"" show in a speaking part no less) but this is essentially Murray's show. What is interesting is that this film does not take a particularly anti-military stance and was instrumental as a recruiting tool for the military much like ""Top Gun"" was in 1986. At the time this film was released in 1981 it demonstrated that the sixties were over and the Age of Reagan had now begun."
4,The cold war comedy that ended the cold war.,"Bill Murray fans have to see this movie! Bill is in full goofy mode for the better part of the film. John Candy, Harold Ramis and John Larroquette provide plenty of laughs as well. Murray always seems at his best when working with Ivan Reitman, and this is no exception.If you like military comedy. If you like comedy in general. If you just wanna see John Candy mud wrestle a couple of women. This is the movie for you."
5,Using scenes for a class - hysterical!,Came in great shape and I got it even before they said I would. No complaints. I am very happy with this product. Amazon has done it again!
5,Great Bonuses for a Classic Film,"First off, this is one of the funniest films ever made. Anything my girlfrieend can sit through and laugh at with me and not at me is gold! The bonuses on the DVD are great. Even though you can see why they took them out of the film, they are some really funny scenes that just didn't belong in the final film.The featurette's are great too, good stories about the cast, which is packed with great actors from Bill Murray to Warren Oates.A MUST OWN DVD for any true comedy film buff."
3,2.5 stars out of 4,"The Bottom Line:Though Stripes has its amusing moments, almost all of them occur in the first half; after the movie leaves boot camp it never recovers what comic momentum it had in the first 50 minutes or so."
3,pretty good film,Bill Murray& Harold Ramis give funny performances in this film.but overall it feels like one long skit from SNL.though it makes the ARMY look cool.
4,Still one of Murray's funniest,"One of the films that helped make Bill Murray one of the most bankable comedy stars is certainly Stripes, and though I have never been one to label it a ""classic"" per se', the film still remains one of Murray's funniest. Though it hasn't aged as well as one may hope, Stripes features Murray, Harold Ramis, and John Candy moving towards their respective creative peaks, and in those respects alone, Stripes is a triumph of time. I won't delve into the storyline (you either know it by now or can read other reviews here), but this Extended Cut DVD features some extra footage that can be interlaced with the film. Sadly, most of this extra footage doesn't amount to a whole lot, and makes the film run for much longer than it really should. That aside though, Stripes remains one of the funniest films of Bill Murray's career, and the fact that the film is still enjoyable to this day surely amounts for something."
2,"Funny movie, HORRIBLE Blu-Ray transfer (one of the worst i've ever seen)","This is a review of the Blu-Ray reissue of ""Stripes"".""Stripes"" is a really funny movie (one of the funniest of the 80's), but if you want to see it (or somehow managed to never see it in 30 years), don't bother paying extra for it on blu-ray, as this has an absolutely HORRIBLE transfer - some of the footage (and i'm talking about footage that was in the original movie in the first place) looks so bad, i'd have sworn it must've been sourced from second and third generation prints. On a lot of scenes, there is a ton of grain, and other footage simply looks out of focus. REALLY disappointed in this transfer - this has to be one of the worst Blu-ray transfers i've ever seen. (FWIW,the extra/extended footage doesn't really add anything to the story, and it's easy to see why the jungle sequence was edited out of the original film)."
5,Greatest Bill Murray Movie ever,Genius Genius Genius! Comedies dont have this type of class anymore. Bill Murray is perfect for this story and it is still funny today. Totally worth ones time. You dont even have to be under the influence to enjoy this but it wouldnt hurt. No food recommendations from me to compliment this movie viewing but maybe just some chips or ice cream will do fine.
5,Great movie with a great cast.,"This movie was great from start to finish. It had great cast Including ""Ghostbusters"" Bill Murray, Harold Ramis (Ghostbusters, Analyze This), Warren Oates,John Candy and Dave Thomas. The plot gets especially interresting when Murray and Ramis steel the new government vehicle and their platoon goes after them and gets captured. So its up to Murray and Ramis to take a trip behind the Iron Curtain to get them out. Co-scripted by star Harold Ramis and directed by Ivan Reitman."
3,"Is it just me, or can Bill Murray not act?","Bill Murray just seems to float through movies and look like he's not even trying to put forth any effort. Every droll line he performs is as dry and without emotion as the last. This movie is no different than 99% of his movies. The ""Yeah, uh-huh, OK."" formula.While his sidekick and Jon Candy save the film, it's centered around Bill Murray who once again seems not to even care a movie is being made."
1,Not a single laugh,"This movie has not stood the test of time. I had the misfortune of watching it recently and there's not a single laugh to be had. Also, if you believe the two ugly douchebags (especially Ramis) get the hot MP girls to love them...yeah right. Its interesting to see the mentality of this time: ""were gonna be so clever and outsmart the military, and hilarious antics are going to ensue."" Watching this movie is about as funny as a jimmy carter speech and is about as depressing when you deconstruct what its saying. There's something slightly grotesque about movies that mock the military. I couldn't help but imagine Bill Murray's character being shipped off to a real war, freezing in a foxhole and having one of his limbs blown off by a landmine. Ive never been in the military, and Im not a hawk, but there is something ugly about the subtext here."
5,"STRIPES , The Review",This has got to be one of Bill Murray's best works of all time. Great film & it will never go out of date .
5,great classic movie!,"If you like silly funny movies, this one is for you. I've always loved this movie and when I thought about getting it on DVD, I came here. Good price, good movie. Nuff said."
5,Bill Murray Stripes,"This movie I always wanted to have, since i own a vehicle similary like this, I love all scenes in this great movie."
3,Some funny moments.,"Like many stories produced for fun, this was awfully short on facts. I suppose that regardless of the focus, those with a modicum of understanding will judge the backdrop. Still, only some of the humor actually made me chuckle. I generally like Bill Murray and think that every comedian who dies due to a terrible lifestyle is a real shame, including John Candy, but they were really capable of better stuff. Compare with the headache in the back of the head from laughter while listening to old Bill Cosby recordings. Need I say more....."
3,Could have done better . . .,"For such an outstanding comedy, this ""Extended Cut"" re-release of Stripes falls far short of what it could be. The video is very grainy, at best and is somewhat of a painstaking endeavour to watch, given the high degree of technology we have today. The video on this DVD should have been digitally restored and the soundtrack flawless. Why are the movie studios so leary of putting out the best they can do? After all, if this is a reflection of the type of work they can put out then most production studios are taking a giant leap backwards.The movie is a classic--if the video and audio digital transfers would have been better I would have given five stars instead of the three.Insist on the highest quality possible!!!"
3,Funny Mindless Comedy,"Great mindless fun. Bill Murray is always a hoot, because you never know what he is going to do next!! His silly arrogance is so unique. He is the true definition of comic relief.Some people who like intelligent movies will be disappointed in the film."
2,Very few funny moments in a boring movie,I like Bill Murray and John Candy but neither are very funny in this horrible pointless movie. It started out ok then gets pretty boring when they join the military. Most jokes are terrible and unfunny along with a boring pointless story. Sean Young is pretty cute but she stays fully clothed so even less to look forward to lol.
5,This Book is Fantastic!,"Growing Your Musician is the only book I've seen that helps parents without a musical background help their children make intelligent choices about which instrument will be right for them. The book is full of easy-to-read charts and other material that helped me know how to encourage my son to practice and really get excited about music. If you want to help your child discover music through an instrument, in school and/or with private lessons, this is the book for you. It answered all my questions as a parent and now I feel comfortable guiding my child."
1,Stuff had expired,"Upon examining the contents of the kits, we noticed that the items were due to expire within 30 days. We returned them for a refund."
4,Good first aid kit,I bought this F/A kit for our son's car. It has pretty good things in it. Not to complicated to see what they are and it's in a handy small pouch that diesm't look girlish. I like it
1,Old-fashioned,"If you need old-fashioned black and white artwork, this is for you. For any other use, or if you need a modern (i.e. after 1930) image, don't bother."
1,Buyer,"Music only- no Richard!! Very disappointed! Was wanting something like his old Take A Walk, but this ain't it! It's just not the same"
2,top is toast-bottom is still white,"Bought this oster WOW so nice looking! (That is where the star comes in.) Yes it gets HOT but it doesn't claim to be cool to the touch either. Bottom line, the top 2 heating elements are close together and centered on the top, the bottom two heating elements are about 5 inches or so apart and towards the back and front, sooo your bread toast perfect on the top side and the bottom part of your bread is WHITE.. We tried moving the rack closer to the bottom and it didn't do any better , just burnt the bottom edges of the bread... I would have kept this toaster oven if it only TOAST better. As for an oven it heats up, (there is the second star.)"
1,One and a half years and broken,"My wife and I bought this toaster in December 2003 because of the large size and nice styling. For over a year we used it primarily for toasting, but started using it a few months ago for baking small dishes (chicken nuggets for the kids, etc). About two weeks ago the top two heating elements stopped working and we noticed that the front one had ""bowed"" in the middle so that it now touches the top of the toaster oven. The top, back heating element is also slightly bent. Nothing extraordinary ever happened to this appliance, and we're not sure what caused the bowing of the top heating elements. Obviously, it should have been able to handle the normal heating /cooling cycles associated with toasting and baking. It's pretty much useless now and is going out with the trash this week. Out of warranty and not much sense spending money trying to repair it. Stay away from this product."
2,got really hot!,"I bought this because the box said ""cool exterior"" I was looking for cool exterior toaster oven cuz I have lil child at home, for safty reason. But it gets really hot outside. Side of toaster was OK but the other parts got really really hot so I refund it. If it gets this hot, nothing difference other cheap stuff to me. this is too expencive I thought."
4,Love them,"Bought these to see if they were still as fun as they were in middle school and they still are. I use them all the time and feel as though they have improved over the years. They write very smooth and i have yet to do they whole ""shaky pen"" thing you use to have to do to get the ink to go down. Would buy again."
4,Brings back memories,These helped feed my nostalgia. I missed being able to draw with these and they're almost impossible to find in any store around here. My only issue is that they would stop feeding the ink a lot so you have to write pretty slow to keep and nice solid line.
4,Fun product,Bought this for my niece for a gift and she loves them. Very glittery and smooth writer. A little spendy but worth the smile on her face.
3,Colors Are Pretty But...,I love the color of these pens. They are glittery but not too glittery. And they write really smooth... That is when they want to write.I have heard good things about the Sakura pens so I'm slightly disappointed with them. Only one pen seems to work really well. The rest just stop writing and I have to scribble with them on a piece of scrap paper for a minute or two to get the ink flowing again. Then after a minute they will stop writing again or sometimes they write just fine but the color gets lighter and lighter as I go. It will start out as a nice vibrant color and then fade until you can hardly see the color at all.
5,SakuraStardust Bold Meteor Pens are the best pens ever! They're my new obsession.,"Wow, do I ever love these pens! Beautiful ink flows so effortlessly that working with them is instant meditation. I do wish there were more colors though. One major difference between the new Stardust and the other Sakura gelly roll pens is the new cap that seems to help keep ink juicy and flowing. I wish other manufacturers would follow suit.The only ways I think Sakura could improve these pens would be to make them more earth-friendly with refillable cartridges and parts that could be recycled. Also, a price reduction would allow those who become addicted to always keep a steady supply. While I'm wishing upon a star, it can't hurt to wish that Sakura would make ALL of their gelly roll pens perform as flawlessly as the Stardust Bold Meteor Pens. Ahhhhhh...what a beautiful thought."
5,Great!!!,"Love it!!! Great, fun HIGH QUALITY gel pens from Japan. Last a long time, and they are awesome, gorgeous on paper. My daughter Loves them!!"
3,"So pretty, but do not want to write","I love Gelly Roll pens, but this glittery set seems not to want to write. Maybe it's just my set, but keep in mind I purchased these from Amazon. I have to keep a sheet of scratch paper nearby to scribble on when they stop writing. It's unfortunate, because this set is so pretty! However, they are cheap, so it might just be worth it.All the colors contain silver micro-glitter that will rub off eventually (run your finger over it when dry and you'll get a bit of glitter), though the ink is archival. Colors included are orange, a purplish blue, a teal blue, green, silver, and rosy pink."
2,Copy Cat,"The story is poorly written. Lame characters. Besides a few good fighting scences, the whole movie is boring. The director is a copy cat.Sung-su Kim was copying all the ideas from The Gladiator, The Lord of the Ring, and etc."
2,Boring!,"Wow, in consideration of the previous reviews, I feel really bad. But here's why this film never made it into mainstream American cinema... I have to say that this was one of the most boring films I've ever seen. Sure, I like an epic story, but this was hardly it. The scenes just dragged on and on and on. And the cinematography was really bad. The colours in general just blended together into blah. Perhaps I was disappointed because I thought I was getting a kung fu action movie. Anyway, I'm sure that the money I spent on this film could be better used elsewhere."
1,BORING,"The movie was simply boring. Do not buy this DVD. The storytelling was slow. There were a couple of shots that could have been edited out. Within the first 10 - 15 minutes there were shots that did nothing to add, develop or enhance the story line. Boring. The costume, cinematography, fight choreography, etc., all lackluster and subpar. I'm not necessarily asking for a big budget martial arts epic, but this was not good. The english dubbed is amusingly bad. I do think part of the soundtrack was dropped. I also have a problem with the voice talent that they used for this film. Maybe I'm used to the voice talents from older martial arts films like Five Deadly Venoms. Oh, I did fall asleep while watching this film."
2,Overhyped,"I saw this movie on the big screen in Korea.Not good. Melodrama to the max. The storyline is nothing we haven't seen before. Perhaps it's another exotic Asian movie that appeals to the audience here, but that's all there is. A bit of action, normal stuff, nothing special. Storyline especially is nothing big. Use of multiple languages is a novelty."
2,"Bit too melodramatic, don't you think?","As far as a martial arts movie goes, Mushoo doesn't contain that much martial arts. I think if I got all my clumsy buddies and me together, we could pretty much cook up something like this too.By the way, doesn't that bow-wielding sargent look a lot like Fred Ward?And I think Zhang Ziyi will always be typecast as the pouty, spoiled, over-sexed female that everyone will want to #$%! but never marry."
5,Great Movie,I Agree with one of the reviews up above about the original korean or China dvd with english subtitles. The subtitles are setup perfectly throughout the movie to where you can read and follow a long and no miss a moment of the action. This is a great movie if you understand the culture that asia was at this particular time.
5,Authentic Feel,"First of all, I am a fan of Zhang Ziyi. Furthermore, the movie has a Chinese (Mandarin) and Korean combined audio track giving it an authentic feel to it. Finally, the action scene at the mud castle was riveting. This is an excellent addition to my foreign collection."
3,save the princess to your dying glory,"The other reviewers must be watching too much Hollywood movies and reality t.v. to think that this movie have many plots and theme. There is only one theme and that is to save the Ming Princess (Ziyi) from the hands of Yuan army by the captive Korean delegates to obtain freedom and respect from the Ming Emperor. There is nothing intriguing and there is no depth to any of the plots whether it be the love affection of the 2 Koreans to the Princess, the fight between the mongols and ming, koreans and the mongols, the korean slave vs the korean general, and etc. The only thing slightly better than Hollywood is that it is not overdone with any special effects, and the acting are pretty good."
4,"The Road Warrior, Ancient Korean Style","Try overlaying the Road Warrior soundtrack over the video for this movie (once they reach the fortress by the sea). Creepy! Seriously, this is a very good historical drama, although it drags in certain sections. Not a ""martial arts"" movie-no wire play or flying people here, very brutal and ""realistic"" fight scenes. GREAT development of the old sargeant and the officers. Would've like to have seen better development of the Mongol chief and the slave/warrior though. And lord humongus was missing."
4,Musa is like watching a modern-day Conan film!,"This is by far the best Asian cinema movie I've seen of this caliber, bar none!If you like awesome action/adventure with fast-paced storyline that also looks authentic - then this one is for you.I was highly pleased with this film, and after renting it at my local Blockbuster, had to buy it. The setting, clothing, weaponry, storyline, and incredible acting here reminded me strongly of Conan the Barbarian in ASIA!Man, after this has to be the Jet Li film HERO. That too is high caliber quality film making. But personally, Musa was a step above."
2,OK at best,"I was really rather bored by this one. It's like the korean version of braveheart I guess, but not as good. Not much martial arts, more of a war epic. This movie just wasn't for me, I should've took the advice of the other 2 star review."
4,Not Crouching Tiger.,"It's no crouching tiger but its still a good action movie, with 9 battles that are all well done and bloody. But thats about all it is everything else seems thrown together but the action kicks total a$$. 8 out of a 10."
3,Be prepared - long and boring - use fast forward,"Musa is a 'Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon' wannabe, the same young actress from CTHD plays the princess in Musa. I love all manner of Asian films, from modern action movies to sci-fi to epics but this picture is just boring. I didnt care about the characters and what happened to them. I didn't even enjoy the action scenes that much. The cinematography is excellent, but it fails to compensate for the other flaws.I'd reccommend Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon or the Once Upon A Time in China series (with Jet Li) instead of this. Actually, almost any of the Tsui Hark historical epic films (such as OUATIC, Dragon Inn, Chinese Ghost Story, Bride with White Hair, Heroic Trio) are more interesting. For a contemporary Korean action film, check out Shiri."
2,Jolly Old Santa Claus,"I was elated when I found this book. I bought it for my children, but was VERY disappointed to see the both the text AND the pictures had been changed! How can they get by with saying they are ""featuring the finely crafted oil paintings by George Hinke along with the original prose story"", when both have been altered. I still have a copy of the original so I can compare. They also reduced the picture size and put in big fancy lettering. Who cares about the lettering... what made people fall in love with the book was the pictures!"
2,I remember this from when I was little.,My grandmother kept the soft copy my mom had as a little girl and only had it out on Christmas. I would sit for hours staring at the artwork oblivious to the actual story. After my grandmother passed away we lost the book. I found this newer copy a few years ago and at first was very excited until I got a good look at it. The artwork is the same except the original version had full page illustrations without all the extra colored text and the black lines outlining ragged edges of the artwork. I feel this ruins the book for those of us who remember the original copy. Can't someone simply reprint the original version without all the updated goo-gunk??? I'd buy a few copies of the orginal re-print in a heartbeat!!
3,I thought I was going nuts!!,"I had to come see the reviews for this book. I got this book last year for Christmas from my mother. It was my oldest sons first Christmas, and it was thrilling to see they reprinted this book. I remember reading the original, a book that was owned by a Great Aunt who lent it to us ,and was returned when she has grandchildren. I remember the text being on the back, and if I am not wrong, wasn't there a picture of the elves sleeping?? The pictures seem cut up. It is wonderful to see that this book remains in some form today, however, I wish they just reprinted the original as was. It was a beautiful book and it now butchered."
2,Jolly Old Santa Claus,"I have searched high and low for this favorite childhood Christmas book that my parents read to me and my siblings. Unfortunately, the newest edition is nothing like the soft covered book my mother still holds close to her heart. The original book has such magical pictures that really do allow you to ""believe"". I remember being read to and then turning the pages to this image that still is imbedded in my mind. I hope they will come out with the first edition of this book, for the newest ""collectors edition"" is not worth collecting at all."
3,"This one is good, if you haven't seen the original.","Like the other reviewers, I was extremely excited when I saw this book in my local book store. I agree that while the pictures are beautiful, the original's were breathtaking. I bought this book to share a little bit of my childhood with my daughter. But I will continue to search used bookstores for a 1st edition copy. The Publisher should definitely consider releasing the original version again. What a great last-Christmas-of-the-20th-century present."
1,"Sniveling ""Political Correctness"" at its worst","This fine book has been ruined by senseless (and unacknowledged) mutilation of the original artwork: in nearly every image of the original, Santa is shown smoking a pipe, while this ""politically correct"" reissue airbrushes out the pipe without even having the decency to admit it. For simpering cowards and nattering nabobs only."
3,"Good Book, But Hardly a ""Collector's Edition""","Growing up, ""Jolly Old Santa Claus"" was a Christmas Eve tradition in my family. And since the one original copy we had growing up still belongs to our parents, my siblings and I were elated to receive copies of this ""Collector's Edition"" for Christmas. Until we opened the book, that is. Many illustrations have been left out, and the ones that have been included are washed out, airbrushed and cropped and do not begin to do justice to the originals. Although it claims to feature the ""Original Story by Sparkie"", somehow the magical ""Brownies"" we always cherished have been transformed into commonplace ""Elves"" and ""Lazy Brownie"" has become the more politically correct ""Jeepers Elf"". What a disappointment! If you remember this book fondly from your childhood, you will be disappointed. If you just want a great story to share with your kids, buy it. It's still one of the best Santa books around."
3,The pictures are good but the original was much better!,"The pictures in this book are amazing but this edition is a disapointment. The original editions have 2 full pages for each picture with the text on the back so it can be read to children sitting in front of you, they look at the pictures & you read. This one has the pictures shrunk to an obscenely small size with the text often taking up more of the page than the picture. Whoever did this one should be ashamed & republish the original!"
4,Beautiful,"My daughter got this book when she was 4 and we still love to look at it every Christmas. There are fun things to find on every page.We love it and have given it as a gift several times, and the kids have loved it.Gorgeous retro book."
1,Gold castle in the sky?,"Unlike the rest of the reviewers, I did not have this book as a child. As a child, I was told that Santa lived in the North Pole, not on a floating golden castle in the sky! Why does he collect trees and make ""Christmas balls"" on Christmas Eve? Did he deliver decorated trees with the presents then? And apparently Santa had to provide his own cookies. And who the heck is Whiskers? The worst part is when ""Uh oh, a boy spies Santa."" What happened to this poor boy? That does not sound good! And lastly, I've gathered that the illustrations are supposed to be classic, but personally I found them creepy."
1,Disappointment,"This new ""Collector's Edition"" is nothing like the original as it claims. The pictures look dingy and dark and don't capture the same magic as the orginal book did. I was thoroughly disppointed to see what had been done to it."
2,Not a worthwhile collector's piece,"I grew up begging my mom to read this to me several times over the Christmas season, and she obliged. As a teen, I latched on to the original copy and still have it. When I saw this hardcover book I bought because I thought the hardcover would keep better.I was disappointed. The story was great, but it was the ARTWORK that made this book a place of magic for me. Unfortunately the publishers--I guess in a bid to save money on publishing costs--did NOT keep to the original format. Even if they had placed a page of text next to a page of artwork, it would have been better. Instead here the text is place ON the picture, taking away from the enjoyment of the artwork. And the pictures have been reduced in size. The original had much larger reproductions of the gorgeous paintings.I'm highly disappointed in this so-called Collector's Edition. I still have the original soft cover and I treat it with kid gloves. That's my collector's edition. Definitely not worth the money."
2,deceptive marketing,"This book is marketed as a ""Collector's Edition"" of the original 1961 George Hinke classic, one of the most charmingly illustrated books ever published for children. It was read to me as a child. I was thrilled to discover it on Amazon, but deeply disappointed when the two hard back copies I ordered arrived. The text has been altered significantly (we don't forget what we read as children, and I have an older copy with a closer-to-original text). And some of George Hinke's illustrations have been eliminated, or are reduced in size, not to mention being washed out which has taken the richness and magic out of the paintings. This patched-together edition is NOT the original book. Corners were cut with the size of the illustrations to save money, the hallmark of so many current products. How stupid do they think we are? I wish I'd read the customer reviews of this book before purchase. The people like me, who knew this book as children, all have the same complaints."
2,Not like the old days,"I was very disappointed with this book. I was expecting the images to be more crisp and vibrnat. For the amount of detail depicted in these amazing pictures the size was not sufficient for little ones to view all that is happening in each of the settings. It just wasn't as good as I remember it being as a child. Oh, and I was disappointed at the removal of some of the original artwork, i.e. the brownies preparing to go to sleep."
5,Actual First Edition 1958,"I have the original first edition Ideals softcover book, which was copyright *** 1958 *** not 1961 (that may be the date the first hardcover version was published). I received it new as a child in 1958, and read it every year to my younger sister until I left home, and years later, to my niece, every year. She now has a child and I'm giving it to her. The pictures by George Hinke are outstanding, and I would not want any to be missing in a reprint edition. This book is beloved for several good reasons: fun and well-written story that doesn't condescend to children, many exquisite and lavish double-page illustrations, and solidly traditional Santa Claus myth. It will never go out of style."
4,Great for experienced windows C++ programmers,"The under-the-hood treatment of MFC is very useful, especially the chapters on OLE with MFC.Warning this book is not for beginners. You must know C++ cold and have at least a working knowlege of the windows API to get the most out of it"
3,Only for advance people,"This book is a very difficult to understand without extensive knowledge of MFC programming to start with. I thought learning MFC with learning what happens under the hood of MFC at the same time would make me a better MFC programmer, but that is not the case. The book assumes quite a bit of MFC knowledge to start. I have had a large amount of experience with C++ and Java with through knowledge of object oriented programming. I am also familiar with Visual Basic. I have other MFC books to couple my learning of MFC with, but this book is only for the pros who has been developing MFC apps for a while."
2,meh,This is an ok series . Honestly I ended up getting rid of this series. I would try to find someone that has it or something lol. Jericho was amuch better post apoctolyptic series although I understand its in a different setting.
3,But for the .... language,"The premise and story are very good, but the language is annoying and interferes with my enjoyment of the show."
3,Definitely needed another season...,This show was good but as all other reviewers stated it ended too abruptly. This show could have easily gone on another year...it seems like they were trying for a five year series but that would have been overkill. It's too bad that they didn't wrap up the loose ends with the final episode or make a movie to do so.Unlike many other reviewers here I didn't think that the language was really an issue...nor was there very much nudity. I still wouldn't let children watch it...but it was made for adults not children.During these 19 episodes you really got to know each of the main five characters. Even though they had different personalities they all flowed together very nicely. They had some interesting plot twists...which makes it all the more sad that they couldn't have done another year.For the price it's worth watching...it's good entertainment but be ready to finish the series in your own head as there is no ending here.
3,uri,"the series was excellent except they didn't give a definite ending, as if there is no certain direction the series will go."
5,Fantastic Series Even If Unresolved,"So what if it's a cliff hanger with no resolution? If a series is really good it doesn't matter if it runs for 1 season or 10 seasons, it's never enough. Didn't the Soprano's get all that press and water-cooler chitchat over it's cliff hanger/no resolution ending (by design and not by short sighted TV execs though). This dead series is better than almost everything else on TV currently and leaves you wishing for more, but something is better than nothing. I am glad I ignored the nay-sayers and bought this series.All the main characters are interesting and the plot/ideas presented are worth thinking about. It also feels good enough to hold up over the years as something I can watch over and over again.Highly recommended SciFi, in my opinion it's up there with Firefly, Farscape, SG's, Dr. Who, etc..."
5,You're got to be kidding,"I can't believe that this series ended where it did, with no resolution. What was it? Lack of ratings or what? I have to admit, I didn't even know about the series until 4 years later, but I'd boil that down to poor advertising. There's all kinds of SHOWTIME advertising for junk like The L Word, Fat Actress and Queer as Folk. Anyone see an agenda here??? Too bad, because everyone I talked to enjoyed it. Maybe HBO will pick it up. We can dream, can't we?"
4,Good but they should continue with the series,"Good series but the ending is a bit disappointing. I will not revile ending but I thing that they should continue with the series. It is like a dead end, but anyway I like it. and one other thing, it should cost bit less."
2,Odyssey 5,This series was a little boring and never resembled the original quest. Kept getting into side issues. I can see why the series was canceled.
2,"Too many plot lines, poor follow-through, unrealistic characters.",The show had a good concept to work with but was handicapped from the start by twitchy irrational characters who behaved more like explosive teenagers than professional astronauts and scientists. And what's the deal with a 22 y/o astronaut? If you can get beyond that then there are the numerous plots and sub-plots which never seem to lead anywhere. Some were good ideas that had potential but even these never related back to the original info given to them by the alien being they meet in the show opener; with over 50 worlds already destroyed are we to believe that rogue sentient computer programs and synthetic beings created by them just popped up randomly by themselves. We never even get a glimpse of an alien race behind the conspiracy nor do we get any other possible explanation. I could go on but the fact that it was cancelled after a single season says it all. It is cheap but it would not be worth a watch even if it were free.
2,Ehh... Good enough for a slow weekend...,"I watched this series a year ago. I remember the premise of a shuttle crew being sent back five years in their lives to avert a disaster. However, I don't remember what happened at the end of the season and I don't really care. Therein lies the crux of the disappointing review. The writing was not good. The acting, especially of the crew's family members, was overdone. It isn't torture to watch. The show is just mediocre SciFi."
4,Very good show,I've just finished the first 2 dvds and have been very happy with the quality of this show. It obviously doesn't have as big a budget as some of the sci fi out there but the story line is very consistent and solid which is more than can be said for most sci-fi which ends up adding in padder and filler episodes.Probably the only other show that I like more than this is Firefly - and that is saying a lot.
3,gift,"Husband has enjoyed this series. CD's don't have any skips, etc. Would recommend this if you like old Sci FI."
2,not worth the cost,The size was way off very thin (cheap) material for the price.over priced priced their should not be a word number required.
2,Rubies yarn babies cowboy,"It looks very cheap. I bought it for my grandson's christmas present. I wanted to return it, but there was about an $8 shipping cost and a r 20% restocking fee. I felt I already had too much money in an inferior product."
2,I'm Not a Big Fan of Dial Soap,"I really don't like Dial soap that much. First, it has a kind of industrial smell too it, like antiseptic or something. I also don't feel quite as fresh and clean after using Dial soap as I do with other soaps. As a result I hardly ever use it anymore."
4,The System,Yes Dont Disturb This Groove is an original. It will always sound good. Buy it if you do not have it.
4,System CD,"There is only 2 songs that I like and remember on this CD. It is a good thing that I like the group, so it was not a waste of money for me."
1,Sucks,The CD skips. Your return policy sucks. How can you return something unopened? You have to listen to it first.
4,CLASSIC SYSTEM!,"This is a great record. It is The System's third release: Their first was the self titled The System, and the release of the song You(Are in my system). Maybe some of you remember the Robert Palmer cover of that song. Or maybe he did it first, whatever. The second was The Pleasure Seekers (Awesome), and now to get to this one... Don't Disturb This Groove is great. There were not a lot of other artists using the technology of The Sinclavier at that time except maybe Michael Jackson. The result is a wide variety of cool sounds, catchy melodies, and great vocals. The mix is phat. I especially liked songs 1, 2, 3, 4, 6. There are some upbeat songs and some great ballads sung uniquely by Mic, of course David Frank is the brains behind the ""GROOVE."" Hats off fellows. Thank you for some great high school and college memories! Peace..."
4,Needs liner notes,"The most frustrating aspect of this box set is the complete lack of liner notes. These are fine live recordings, but the listener is left only to wonder as to their origins. I want to give this package two stars for the lack of notes, but the music is deserves five, so I give it a four."
5,Essential Pre-Blues Memphis Music,"Who can listen to ""My Monday Woman"" and truly not enjoy it? This disc is full of Pre-Blues gems, despite the sameness of the guitar playing on nearly every track. Jim Jackson has a warm and endearing voice and a large repertoire of songs. I recommend listening to this disc in conjunction with Document Records' Furry Lewis disc and some Frank Stokes, in order to get a good view of what Memphis must have been like in the first decade of the 20th century."
1,not very useful,"I got it from the local bookstore. When I tried to use it with my son, I found that it is not very useful, the Bible verse is cut to short and hard to understand. The key point is clear and hard to catch. No any Bible story in it. Waste time and money."
3,Flavor of the week metal and a left over disc,"I have been going to Ozzfest for 3 years straight, 1998, 1999 and 2000, and every year it just seems to get more diluted and boring. True, there are always great acts that far outweigh the bad, but the first CD does not show that at all. Instead of all the great acts that Ozzfest2K had to offer, we get the focus on the Second Stage, which usually isn't bad. While it benefits from crushing tracks by Soulfly and Taproot and a great rare song by Queens of the Stone Age, it just suffers from so much other mediocre nu-metal junk. The second disc is a great disc, but just repackaged in with the second stage. It features great live stuff from Fear Factory, Sepultura, Slayer and Biohazard. But nothing makes this 2 disc live set more satisfying than Ozzy himself, who personally closes out each set himself."
1,The worst live CD ever made!,"The thing I hate about live CDs are that the sound quality 25% of the time .... This CD is the epitomy of ... sound! I could barely hear a single word any of the singers were saying. That is why I immediately gave this to my cousin. I couldn't stand it. I was hesitant about buying The Second Millenium, but I looked at the record labels producing it and it was Ozzy's label Epic records and I knew it would a good quality record. I was right. That CD is a better buy, but good luck finding an edited version. I bought what I thought was the edited version (it had an edited and a Parental Advisory sticker) but it had a lot of cursing which did not make me very happy. Do not buy this CD period! I can't wait for Ozzfest 2002: The Live Album . I will be getting the edited version since I don't care much for explicit versions."
4,Smooth Jazz Ride,"Although I found this recording mostly uneventful, it had nothing objectionable and it was a consistent diversion from the usual modern noise. The vocal cuts were the high points and showed the most growth and distinction. Any fan of ""smooth jazz"" would find it top drawer and a cut above the usual definition."
5,Most enjoyable,"My daughter, who was 8 at the time, chose this game when she received an Amazon.com gift card for her birthday. I was a little concerned that the game would be too complex for her. It IS a rather complicated game, but she loves it, and quickly developed stratagems to equal any adult who plays against her. The whole family has spent many enjoyable hours playing this game."
3,"Well constructed, fun theme, A bit slow","In my opinion, this is not one of the better days of wonder games (Brand). Like always, the game construction is high quality and ""pretty.""I'd describe the game as Kinda like clue, but without the weapons or rooms (it has rooms, but not like clue, different things happen depending on which room you enter), and with a touch of ""Guess who.""It is good, but I have found that it almost always moves along a little slow for my taste, and I find the rotating Mass rule thing a bit confusing and overly complicated.Not a game I ever expect will have it's own tournaments. Still, It is way better than monopoly."
4,Karen thought,"Interesting game, the rooms are written in latin. Like clue only with three types of monks, also more involved. Game is heavy duty made so will last for a long time."
5,"Best ""Days of Wonder"" game we've played","Let me preface this by saying that I am writing from the perspective of having played this game with the same group of four - two couples - who like board games and are excited by the notion of ""Clue on steroids,"" but who aren't obsessive game junkies. Take this for what it's worth.If you are looking for an amped up version of ""Clue,"" this is it. Excellent playability, really fun and really challenging. Excellent design, quality throughout. Hard to come up with a serious criticism of this game - it's not overly complicated, it's not redundant after multiple plays, it has an open feel to it that invites introducing your own rules (which we did), and it doesn't take excessively long. Can't say enough about this game - if you're a whodunit fan this is right in your sweet spot. (If you're wavering between this and Days of Wonder's ""Mystery Express,"" don't hesitate - this one is far, far superior.)"
4,Great game,"We've enjoyed every game we have played thus far. It took some time to learn the right questions to ask for the best responses, so if you buy this I do suggest reading some strategy or suggested questions online to get you going.I didn't give it a 5 out of 5 because there are some aspects of the game that go unused before it is not necessary if you know the best strat for completing your suspect list. I still recommend it, especially for anyone that loved Guess Who when they were young, and Clue when they were a little older, this is the next generation."
1,waste of money,"this video is chessy...if u are looking for a serious cardio aerobics, something that would help u lose weight..then this is nt for u...and in my opinion..its not even a good belly dance video, if thats what ur trying t o learn..."
5,"Bellydance, no - Bellydance WORKOUT? Absolutely.","I have quite a collection of bellydance videos, owning all of Rania's workouts, all but one of Veena and Neena's, and two of Dolphina's (Intro to Bellydance and Warrior Goddess). I must say, as much as I practice each one of them, this one never seems to get old; I could do it everyday. Granted it's not traditional, flowing, bellydance, it's fun 100%. Besides, to any of those complaining about this workout being too rigid, consider this - you bought a Bellydance FITNESS DVD, not a Learn to Bellydance video.And fitness you cetainly get: great warmup, awesome routine that leaves room for your own attitude to come through, and soothing cooldown. If nothing else, buy it for Rania's performance at the end - very powerful!"
3,It's alright... BUT,"it's not really ""hip hop"" nor is it necessarily all about ""hip drops"" either! Don't get me wrong, one will DEFINITELY work up a sweat with this DVD. I just expected more of an actual hip hop sound (think of someone like Lauryn Hill) and more instruction on how to actually do the moves than was given. The workout itself was a weird combination of belly dance and pop dance moves which was not what I was expecting at all. I bought the DVD for the hip drops, not to learn how to dance!! And is it just me or does Rania become a tad bit annoying with all the fake smiling? Just curious... Overall though, I would still recommend this DVD to someone who's looking for a decent belly dance inspired workout. The performance segments at the end of the workshop are worth the price as well."
3,moves are nice yet not too much of a workout,"I bought a combination video which had hip drop hip hop & Pure sweat. I didn't really mind the music or setting, but the video becomes boring quickly. Not only that, but it does not offer a challenging workout. ( I'm not overweight, yet not fit ) If you are overweight though, the video isn't too hard to do(rewind button for a few moves) and it little by little teaches you a nice dance at the end of the workout. If your somewhat fit, save your money and buy something else, I personally like billy blanks tae bo videos, they'll make you sweat! :o)"
2,It was okay,"The video was okay but it just wasn't what I was expecting. When I read the description on the back of the box I was expecting somewhat of a workout. At no point did my pulse rise during the workout. I felt that the video was slow and way too repetetive and I got bored. I realize that she is a dancer and not an instructor, but I do feel that the words should go along with the moves.I'm not saying that the video was terrible....but it just wasn't what I needed. It wasn't aerobic at all."
2,"Interesting at first, but becomes boring very fast","I bought this tape because I not only wanted to add something interesting to my workout routine, but to also hopefully learn a little bellydancing. I was very dissapointed. Althought you'll feel the result of the workout the next day, the moves were very repetitive, stiff and boring. You will basically be doing what seems like a low-intensity dance routine, but broken into segments. After doing a segment three or four times, then you move on to a new segment. Once you've learned the new segment, you will then start over from the beginning, but this time incorporating the new segment that you just learned. The entire workout is set up this way. If you are looking for a challenge that will have you sweating, this tape is not for you. I used this tape for maybe two weeks before tossing it into my closet."
3,Good for some....maybe,"I borrowed this DVD from the library and I'm glad I didn't buy it. The first time through i noticed it was really repetitive. I went to do it again the next day and I couldnt bring myself to do it. After about 10 minutes I turned it off because I was bored and went back to a video that I have done countless times before. In addition, there were several bad cuts.I think this DVD would be good for someone who has had NO dance training, or is not used to working out. This may also be good for light days as long as you are not bored by repetition."
1,Dont buy it,waste of money it shows the same moves over and over. Not worth it I'm sure that there are better belly dancing videos out there. Also that hip hop drop is also a con
5,this video rocks the house!,"This dvd is excellent, excellent quality and content, and very danceable music. Great, hip, fresh dance workout routine, two amazingly incredible performances by Rania. And there is a bonus workout that just proves what good shape Rania is in. From the cover of the DVD I thought she looked a little heavy and older, but when I started watching the dvd I could see she is young and in perfect Barbie Doll shape, so don't let the cover fool you!"
4,"This is fun, but quite difficult.","If you're up for a challenge, this game is for you. Good graphics, gameplay and weapons. It does get pretty hard after you get through a few levels. I like a bit of a challenge, but I don't like to do levels over and over and over again until I get disgusted. Eventually you'll pass it, but not as quickly as you might want. Still, overall this is a great game, difficulty aside. 4.5/5 rating."
2,Conflict Global Terror Does Work on 360,I should have done my homework - Conflict Global Terror will not work on X-Box 360 so I had to return it. Amazon was very kind in allowing me to send it back.
4,History and Geography United,"Since this book was published in 1992, one of the author's first, it is somewhat outdated. Nonetheless, the author demonstrates deep and extensive knowledge of the area. The picture painted of the exploitation and current defficulties of this area are presented clearly. For anyone interested in one or all of the islands, this book will provide a valuable resource."
5,Illuminating and refreshing work by Kurlansky,"Kurlansky illuminates inquisitive minds with a refreshing look at the Caribbean. Delving beyond the surface of the islands, he captures very real portraits of the people and highlights their culture, problems, triumphs and humanity. Kurlansky treats all of the islands from Cuba to Trinidad with intellectual sensibility and equality, which contrasts several other authors myopic focus on a few selected islands and exclusion of subtle cultural points. For those people looking for information about the cultural similarities and differences of the Caribbean people and the challenges they face now and in the future, Kurlansky's ""A Continent of Islands: Searching for the Caribbean Destiny"" is an excellent choice. It is an enlightning book for Caribbeans and curious people, alike."
1,Almost caught fire,Buyer Beware----Warning to all: if you purchase this product and the lever is sticky immediately return the item. Ours was a little sticky--we thought it would sort itself out after a little use--it did not turn out that way. The lever sticks and the toast will just stay in the cooking section and not pop up--thereby creating the possiblity that your toast can catch on fire--which ours did! Glad I caught it before the house caught on fire. We only used the product twice.
2,OK for a while,"This toaster worked OK for about 4 months but now it will not toast at all. Put in two slices of beard, turn it to the highest setting and you get dry bread. Again, you get what you pay for."
1,This toaster does not lift a standard peice of bread high enough to retreive easily.,This toaster does not lift a standard peice of bread high enough to retreive easily. Even when lifting the handle I am likely to burn my fingers on the toaster. I thought it was defective and the supplier sent another one. It functioned the same. I'll have to buy a different one.
3,"Oster 6325 2-Slice Toaster, Brushed Stainless",Item received on time as expected and undamaged. The advertisement said extra wide slots that I didn't find accomodating to bread items I normally toast. I used the toaster for awhile and now have it in storage. Amazon handled the tranaction professionally as well as past orders.
1,Poor quality,"I purchased two of these. The first one died in about two years (heating element burned out on one side). Liked the looks of it (poor reason), so gave it a second chance and purchased another one. The second one lasted about three years. The second one died this morning when the ""seat"" the toast sits on and raises up and down broke in one of the slots (entire seat laying loose on the bottom). Neither heating element will come on."
1,Oster toaster 6325,"Well, looked up reviews at Macys.com and were great. The one purchased doesn't toast evenly at all and outer shell gets really hot and easily can burn yourself. New model should be out this year. Very disappointed, not worth the hassle of returning will give away to a someone in need.RSL"
2,Avoid this one!,"Of all things weird - I felt strongly enough about this toaster to write my first review. I checked on a lot of toasters and this seemed to have everything I needed - or at least I thought so. I ultimately chose it because it had the longer slots that would work better for the organic and oval-shaped breads that I toast. Longer slots - yes, but the bread falls down into slots and there is no pop-up button, so I've burnt my fingers a number of times. I thought my old cheap toaster was bad, but this thing is really irritating. I'm not terribly picky about toast, but the bread is never toasted evenly. Some spots will be quite dark and others will be untoasted. Yesterday two slices were dark and two done right after that were barely brown. One last thing - the toast cycle takes forever. My pot of tea or coffee is ready before the toast is done. I guess the only advantage is that it looks nice."
1,Keep looking at other toasters,"I purchased this toaster and very disappointed, the slots are too deep, darkness settings don't work, can't get the toast out, have to unplug and use a knife then the toast is torn into pieces and some stay in the bottom and burn, constantly setting off the smoke alarm"
2,Slow!!!,"This toaster looks great, but it is incredibly slow, much slower than the cheapo toaster I owned before this one. It takes 2-3 minutes for a piece of bread to toast. It does seem to toast evenly, though.It features a removable crumb tray, but the ""shell"" of the toaster is one piece, so there is still a solid bottom beneath the crumb tray. If crumbs fall off the crumb tray they are trapped at the bottom of the toaster. I have a couple of large crumbs stuck in the bottom of the toaster that I cannot get out. Fortunately, they do not burn or smoke when the toaster is in use.I would rate this toaster high on looks, low on performance."
4,Oster Toaster is a Hit,"This is an excellent choice for a two-slice toaster. It toasts very evenly and allows for a wide variety of settings light to dark. It also has a nifty feature, a button that will instantly cancel the toasting process.This toaster looks good and is a space saver. I would recommend this to any connoisseur of toast."
2,Toast needs fork to retrieve it.,"First toaster I've ever owned that needed a Fork to dig out the toast. $40 wasted. Now you know why the picture shows the toast standing on it's end, I guess a little untoasted bread is better than the fork idea. :-)Bill in Las Vegas"
5,Works great for me,"I'm not sure what the other reviews are talking about when they say this toasts only one side? I'm not a toaster-snob, so for me this little toaster works great and looks nice sitting on my counter. I haven't noticed any one sided toasting issues. I only toast every couple weeks or so at the most, and so far so good."
5,Motorcycle goggles,"I have had these goggles for over a year and I love them. I like the option of being able to change lens color. I use them mostly in the summer for riding, but have discovered they work well for cross country skiing, especially when it is overcast and the yellow lens provide a ""sunny like"" day across the snow trails."
5,get over it!!!,"This movie combo. is great. It shows the Wiggles at their best at two different points in their career. Sure, the production for Wiggly Party was less expensive, but as far as music and scits go, it is a much more entertaining video than all of their recent stuff. As far as kids being freaked out by seeing younger, less polished Wiggles, GET OVER IT!!! Change is a part of life. Are you not going to show your children pictures of you when you were younger because it might freak them out??? In addition, the Wiggles have changed Dorothy, Wags, and Henry in their newer productions, yet no one seems to notice that or be bothered by it. My child isn't even two yet and Loves BOTH of these movies. This is the Wiggles at their best!"
5,The Best Dramatic Series Ever!,"Wow! I remember seeing this for the first time when I was about 13. It is almost exactly as I remembered! Just great! The plots are thick and quickly moving, and even my husband, who hates ""hoity-toity"" English movies couldn't wait for the next episode of this series! Start with Poldark I so you get a background. Poldark I is a great series too so it should be no hardship bringing you up to speed."
1,this disc stinks,"This disk has clip art of robots, planets, etc. Most of it looks like what you'd see at a high school art show. Really amateurish and awkward--mostly just bad art. Don't do it."
1,The worst quality I have ever listened,"I have more than 1000 CD's, and these have the worst quality I have ever had. I do understand that these are old recordings but the noise is EXTREMELY loud. I purchased the first four volumes and all of them are the same: AWFUL !!!!.Do yourself a favor: Do not buy these records"
3,An ordinary tale about Guinevere,"The introduction leads you to expect great things from this book: the story of Guinevere and King Arthur from from a person who claims to have been Guinevere in a past life.The author has a vivid imagination, but it cannot be a true past life. Guinevere, Arthur and the rest never existed as real people.They are archetypes who exist in the mythic realm.To treat them as mere human beings overlooks their real grandeur.What the author learnt from it all does have interest,namely: ""Suppression creates separateness.Expression creates oneness."""
1,A sadly disappointing book,"Perhaps I should start by saying that I did not finish reading this book as I could no longer stand reading what was supposedly non-fiction, but cannot be anything else but fiction. How I base this is quite simple, I am what you might call a bit of Historian, I am interested in Medieval Literature and have researched various retellings of the Arthurian Legend. Admittedly no one can profess to 'know' the authenticity of a 'Legend' however, this work relies solely on dreams, and bears very little resemblance to the historical depiction of Guinevere. I was left disappointed by what I consider to be feminist fiction disguised as non-fiction."
5,Excellent book!,"I have read so many books on the Arthurian times, which places Arthur in the 15th century, which of course is ridiclous. Miss Phelan, accuratly places him in the 5th century. This book excluding the reincarnation part is very real indeed. I just dont believe in reincarnation myself, however the story is fantastic."
3,3 stars only because it is Barney,"My 18 month old doesnt sit through these, They gets 3 stars only because it is Barney and she just LOVES Barney.Lets go to the Zoo is much better than Round and Round we go. The Animals get her attention. However, it is defective. The sound goes off and the DVD skips/jumps.I cant even return them because I live in Hong Kong (had it delivered to a US address while my husband was visiting back home) it isnt worth the cost of mailing it back to Amazon."
2,Not a fan.,"I wish that I could regain the time I spent reading this book or the money I spent buying it. It looks like it was a superb book back in 1997 when people actually used versions 9.03 and 10, but a lot of the commands in this book aren't even usable on my 10.20 system and it would appear that a lot of the concepts are no longer viable.I'm giving it two stars because it's probably a good historical reference. Let's see ""Version 2"" someday."
4,"Good Book - an almost one stop shop, but it needs updating.","I found this book to be an almost one stop shop for information on HP disk management. My only real complaint is that the book needs updating. It was a quick read and very good review for me. It also pointed out a few things I need to consider more when doing disk configurations. All in all a valuable book for HP-UX admins, it is worth the small investment cost."
5,Very good cook book for LVM beginners and also experst,I ordered this book 3 years ago (through Amazon) and I still enjoy the fact that I have this book and still it is very useful for me in my daily job with Logical Volumes etc.Very good step by step commands for people who are not so familiar with LVM. Also very good examples for like Exporting and Importing of Volume Groups for more experienced SysAdmins. This 39 bucks are a really good investment.
4,Needs instructions,"I spent a considerable amount of time trying to figure out how to attach these battery packs to my Atomic boots. There was no instruction booklet with the pack. I talked to two salesmen at the store where I had purchased the Atomic boots which were pre-wired for the Therm-ic battery packs. They both said you just have to slide the clip over the top of the boot which didn't seem right at all. They said the square ""Recco"" tab on the back of the boots was to find you if you were caught in an avalanche and it had nothing to do with attaching the battery packs (wrong). It was finally my wife who figured out that you have to turn the battery pack sideways at a 90 degree angle, force the metal clip over the square ""Recco"" tab on the back of the boot and then rotate it 90 degrees back to an upright position. Easy once someone tells you."
4,stands the test of time,"Had not listened to any Zebra in a long time. I remember having their 3 cassettes at one time and listening to them alot back then. Looking for new music to buy I got stumped as to what to buy, so I thought about music I once had on cassettes and did not transfer to CD. Zebra came to mind and the 1st one I downloaded was this one...and after listening to it years later, it really has stood the test of time, as had the other 2 older zebra albums. Overall this is my fave, followed by zebra(1st album), no telling lies. The greatest hits...the two songs I never heard- one song was good- the other was crap.If someone wanted to check out Zebra, I would suggest starting with this album 1st. One of the better bands to come out of the New Orleans area- along with Lilian Axe and Better than Ezra. and of course the great Phil Anselmno(Pantera, Superjoint Ritual, Arson Anthem, Down...etc)"

4,anthems for the working man,"Metzy,and the boys are probably the best of the 80,s Oi bands to come out of the north of England at this time.The fear of unemployment,The pride in a socialy bankrupt England,and true working class ethics are all expounded in this album.Some of the songs lyrics may seem trite and dated now.But thew a big punch in the Bad old Thatcher days.Makes a great little history statment and still worth playing."
2,"Author is confused, and confuses her readers","This author is imprecise in her use of terminology. She switches between similar terms for the same thing without signaling. She uses the same term for different things without signaling. She even uses incorrect terms.The author tends to use a concept in a discussion and then, later, she introduces the concept formally to the reader. Sometimes she never introduces the concept, and youstruggle with the text before you realize that a new concept is involved and you must set about untangling the spaghetti on your own.On a positive note, the author makes good use of analogies to illustrate abstract programming concepts. Overall, however, this text is a monument to mediocrity."
2,"Unorganized, very confusing for an already confusing topic","I knew that this wouldn't be an easy class to take, but the previous review did a great job of describing this book's problems. In my opinion, it should be added that the chapters are unorganized. There are many errors in the book, including an error in the code on page 80 (which I confirmed with my instructor). If your school requires this book, make sure you buy an additional book (probably a Dummies book) or some other learning aid. The author did make good use of analogies, but that's about it."
1,Impossible to Follow,This is a terrible textbook and I have no idea how I'm making a 98 in this class.I had to ask my ex for help (and he's a seasoned programmer) and even he couldn't figure out what I was talking about (like who uses psuedocode? What happened to teaching Pascal?)I'm so scared--my Java class is using a textbook written by the same person!!!
3,10-page plot in a 68-page book,"Beginning readers may well enjoy this story, and especially the cute illustrations. But as an adult reading to a preschooler, I found it too short on plot to justify its length and quickly became bored. Even my daughter was squirming about halfway through. Furthermore, the fact that one of the old ladies in the story was named ""Baby"" was really confusing to her (""That's not a baby!""), and just seemed weird to me. After the first time reading the book, I hid it from her so she would not ask for it again. In a couple of years when she's reading on her own, I'll probably give it back to her and see if she's interested."
4,Laughter and a pig,"I bought Mercy watson for my 2nd grade son after he told me his teacher had read one in class and he thought it was funny. He read the entire book the day he got it. The mercy books are great for kids just starting out on chapter books. Colorful pictures, some action and lots of humor."
3,Ketchup in Pad Thai???,"I've had this book for years and although there's a lot that's good about it (and the recipes are tasty) this book has a pretty typical problem: it was written in 1981. Most experienced cooks know that cookbooks from this time period suffered from at least one of two problems: 1 (and this is not this book's problem) the confusion that oleo or veggie oil is butter or 2 (and this is this book's problem) a general lack of availability of authentic ingredients which leads to ridiculous substitutions which just don't quite work. No matter how many great stories JB tells, she still substitutes ketchup for tamarind paste and as much as I love my Pittsburgher Heinz 57 Lovin' soul, ketchup ain't tamarind.Otherwise, not a bad cookbook, which I do reference often, if just to read JB's stories."
3,"Interesting information and recipes, but format needs work.","Recipes would be more user-friendly if formatted to make it possible to, at a glance, peruse the steps to follow, rather than have to read through the paragraphs and try to separate out the ""to do"" information. We like recipes to appear on one page, if possible, or at least to lay out so that ingredients and at least most of the preparation steps appear together.Recipes could be simplified by using--or at least pointing out-- possible shortcuts making use of products available through Thai grocers. This cookbook would make Thai cooking more accessible if it informed users/cooks that these products are an option that in many cases, could simplify the recipes."
1,Not Worth It,First I can't believe I paid $30 dollars for a book full of typos. Second I take issue with someone who calls into question the credibility of other so called experts on JFK when apparently you fall into the same category. The author is a self proclaimed archivist and historian. What are your academic credentials? Beware when you read anything by a self appointed expert who can't get his bilge published by a reputable publisher so he has to self publish. If you're thinking of buying this book save your money.
4,1 out of 2,I loved The Duke's Wager and was bored by Lord of Dishonor. See my reviews on the individual books.
3,Almost there-NOT,"They are too large for what I want. They do hold on to fabric nicely as they cut but are not fine enough. They, like all the others, grind and have to be waxed every few minutes. Try Clover scissors instead."
5,What else can you say - Michael Ball is wonderful,Just a quick and easy review here - just buy it. Michael Ball - Oh Holy Night. Enough said.
2,I like Michael but this album is mediocre.,"Michael Ball has a great voice and his version of ""O holy night"" is worth the price of the whole CD - however this is not a great Christmas album.I do not consider Bette Midler's ""From a distance"" or ABBA's ""Happy New Year"" - Christmas songs.I love some of his other albums but I would suggest you buy LINDA EDER'S Christmas album. Its the best"
5,FANTASTIC,"This compendium of Christmas favorites is a spectular holiday treat, particularly with the inclusion of a highly upbeated version of Chris Rhea's ""Drivin' Home for Christmas."" There's no question that Michael Ball's voice is phenomenal, and his mellifluous presentation often causes those not familiar with his reputation to pause when hearing him sing and comment on his obvious talent. You will find yourself ""looping"" this disk over all other holiday versions. After owning it for two years, I play it even in the off-season, that's how good Ball's performance is."
4,"Wonderful, except for...","I agree with everything other reviewers have said, but I must say that I am quite disappointed with the first line of Ave Maria, where Michael fails to roll his ""r"" and swallows his ""a"". Oddly, he remembers to use the ""proper"" accent for the rest of the song, thus saving it. Otherwise, the rest of this CD is beautiful -- Michael at his usual best, and orchestrations which stir the heart."
2,I've had better,The picture was better than the real product. One of the cz stones fell out within the first month and I work in an office setting with very little stress to the hands. I gave the ring away. I was not very satisfied with the quality. I'm glad other reviewers were pleased with their ring.
4,an effective reaction,"This book is written in reaction to the tendency of neo-scholastic thinkers to neglect the role of the figure of Christ in the thought of Albert the Great, Thomas Aquinas, and other Dominican thinkers. To redress this imbalance, Emery and Wawrykow have done an excellent job of compiling essays to address the long-neglected depictions of Christ in the writings and art of the medieval Dominicans through a multidisciplinary approach."
5,"Very Creepily Fun Deck, hehe!","Hey Fellow Diviners,This deck is interesting. I thought it'd just be your run-of-the-mill oracle, but it is actually rather interesting. Besides the odd campy (but fun) look to it, which is unique, it also has a very dramatic, campy feel, but with room for interpretation (though surprisingly specific for being simply keywords).Here's a funny example: Today I said ""Give me some good news!"" half-jokingly, and I pulled one card. The ""Good News"" card!!! Wowza. That was odd.I say it's worth a look even though on occasion the meanings are a bit hard to use in traditional tarot spreads. I think it's better for smaller spreads or for a single card pull, but I also don't have much practice with this particular deck, so that could be the issue as well.Two thumbs up for the dramatic black/white and red Answer Deck of the ages! :)"
3,Good shoe but...,"This is not only a comfortable shoe, but it also has a great sized heel. I am a teacher and stand all day plus walk around a huge campus, so I need something stylish yet comfortable and this does the trick. The one downfall is that I have to wear a little toe covering with it because my toe polish rubs on the inside and makes a weird sound. Other than that minor set back it is a great shoe and so much cheaper than buying at a department store. The sizing is a little off, so check about refunds."
4,"Yep, it works!","This was the cheapest nail polish thinner, so of course it's the one I bought. It works great. I put a few drops in a polish that's gotten thick and clumpy, and this restores it to a usable state. However -- the next time I go to use the polish, it's generally thick again. Not a big deal. After a year, I've barely made a dent in the bottle of thinner, and my clumpy polishes are generally the ones I never use anyway. My biggest lament is really that this doesn't come with one of those sucking syringe things, so that has to be bought separately. Otherwise, good product."
1,This sucks,"This so called nail polish thinner actually doesn't work. I used it to thin many of my nail polish and at a glance, it seemed to work. However, when I actually used them, they were thickened again. It kind of ruined my favorite nail polishes...so disappointed."
5,Great product!,"This is great to use to bring back the nail polish that has gotten a little too thick to apply evenly to a more desired consistency, love it!"
1,Doesn't work,"I'm a nail blogger so I have a ton of polish and a lot of it is getting pretty thick. With the good reviews on this thinner I thought this was the cheaper option to my costly problem. WRONG! This thinner sticks. Both literally and figuratively. It has a very strong scent to it, but as it's a chemical product that was expected. What I didn't expect was for this thinner not to work -- at all! I tried fewer drops; I tried more drops. Nothing. My thickened polish gets this watery wet look to it as the thinner settles over it, but it stays thick and gooey. The thinner just doesn't seem to penetrate the thick polish no matter how much rolling or shaking I do. I tried this in one of my polishes that was just starting to thicken and managed to get some of it on my nail, but it just caused horrible bubbling. It's a complete and total waste of time, polish, and money."
1,nail thinner,"I bought this thinner and left it in my nailart bottle. it came to the top and when I went to do a nail design it was horrible. It made the nail polish dull, and very watery. this product stinks!!!!!"
1,Super nail polish thinner oz,"I hate the smell of this product, it's so strong!Also, it does not work with any of my nail polishes that are Drying or gooey. I put a few drops at a time and shook it. Nothing. I feel like it was a waste of money"
4,"Very large bottle, inconvenient opening.","The price to quantity ratio is excellent. When I poured a few drops into my sticky nail polishes, it gave them their original normal paint consistency. However, the act of puring into the bottle proved to be difficult. The opening was about the size of a dime, and I found myself spilling the stuff all over the side of my nail polish bottle, so I would recommend buying a designated eye dropper to use. Shipping was less than a couple of weeks."
5,Works well.,"I rarely use nail polish, so I'm very sad when my almost-full bottles start to get thick and gooey. I bought this hoping it would thin out my polish and it did. The bottle is pretty large and a small amount will thin out a regular sized bottle of nail polish. The only request I would make is that I wish it came with some sort of a dropper because the mouth of the bottle is much larger than the mouth of a nail polish bottle, so it is very easy to make a mess if you have shaky hands. Otherwise, this was a great buy."
4,Masonic Chapter Pennies,"This book is a compilation of information regarding Royal Arch Chapter Pennies from the Masonic fraternity. Written in 1930, it offers a glimpse into the past for the collector about coins that were available at that time. The book is a catalog of the Albert Hanauer collection which is housed at the Scottish Rite House of the Temple in Washington, D.C. Since this book was published hundreds of Royal Arch Chapters have come into existence and hundreds more have demised or merged, so this book is very dated. Written descriptions of coins from each of the States (1930's remember) includes the material, name of the Chapter, the number of the Chapter and the city were it is located. In the rear of the book in a number of photographic plates showing an incredible variety of pieces. This book is a must for the serious collector."
5,"A ""must have"" on the spice rack","On Salad, fish, poultry, beef, soup or steamed veggies, Zatarain's Creole Seasoning enhances virtually any culinary creation. It has a lot of flavor and a nice little ""zip"" but not what one would describe as ""hot"" like Tobasco Sauce or Jalapenos. Dinner guests always want to know what that wonderful seasoning is in my food, most of the time it's the Zatarain's."
1,NOT Gluten Free !,"The ingredients say: Bacon Type Flavor (Hydrolyzed Corn Soy Wheat Gluten Protein,So this is NOT GLUTEN FREE and is mis-categorized"
1,HAS GLUTEN IN IT!!!!!,"Second item you can't trust Amazon calling ""gluten free"". What do they think hydrolyzed corn soy WHEAT GLUTEN protein is?"

1,loses time,loses 1 to 2 minutes every 6 to 8 hours. twicw it has lost as much as 20 minutes over night. not worth the hassle to return it just bought another watch.
3,Poor contrast,"As beautiful as the watch is, I find the (lack of) contrast of the silver hands on the dark face makes it sometimes hard to read."
4,Gifting expertise,"I bought this watch for my anniversary as a gift for my lover. He simply loves the watch and wears it everywhere since it's very casual, yet it's suave enough to wear to work and such. It does have a nice ""green"" backlight to it and metal-pieces for the numbers are very nice. Great buy!"
2,Timex Watch review,"I was disappointed in this watch, but only because I didn't read the specifics and made my purchase on the image of the watch. In the image, the watch face appears black. It is not. It is gray. And I also like thin watches...low profile I guess. This one is a little thicker than I desired. I'm not one to return things, so I'll keep it. I like watches. Simple watches. Watches without numbers that are thin. I have a couple great Seiko's that fit the bill, and I unfortunately thought this was in the same ballpark but at a much cheaper price. YOu get what you pay for. I'll probably give this to a nephew or something."
1,Didn't work on day one,"Looks good, but didn't keep time from the start. Would be pretty close to on time when it sat overnight, but if it was worn it will lose about 10 minutes a day. Really not a very good time piece."
4,"Classic watch, solid purchase","This watch looks great and, through the first month of ownership, has kept time well. My only complaint is that it is difficult to adjust the date and time because it is a tedious experience to turn the little knob on the side of the watch. If you have very large, fat, or arthritic fingers this might not be a good watch for you."
4,Good watch/very reasonable price,"This is a good looking dressy watch which definately looks more expensive than the going price. It's a Timex,(therefore pretty reliable)cheap, and attractive. If I had to nit pick, it would be the flimsy loops on the watch strap."
2,Low battery life,"It sure is a nice looking watch, but the battery lasted less than a year. I bought it at Target last winter and it just died in August. After countless tries, I was finally able to pry the back off. I have never seen a cover so stubborn, I have always changed my own batteries in the past and never had a real problem. After I finally found the battery, getting the cover back in place was a real problem. I resorted to squeezing and mild pounding with a hammer to no avail. Finally, I used a C-clamp to force the cover back on. I did use two pieces of wood in between the watch and the C-clamp so there was no direct pressure on the watch, but the watch is now essentially broken, the hands move in all crazy directions. So, if you do buy this watch and the battery goes, have a pro change the battery for you."
5,A Love Contract,"There can be no love between strangers. Helen Stewart was a woman disenchanted with love. She scorned the whole idea of romance.Leon Petrou was a man with no need for love. He used women merely to satisfy his own desire.Under the circumstances, Leon's proposal of marriage was as surprised as Helen's acceptance. Helen thought the marriage was strictly for the sake of Leon's small niece and nephew; she would never become emotionally or physically involved with Leon.But Helen's assumption probed dangerously wrong!"
5,Love The Second Time Around,"'There can be no love between strangers. Helen Stewart was a woman disenchanted with love.

Helen thought the marriage was strictly for the sake of Leon's small niece and nephew; she would never become emotionally or physically involved with Leon.But Helen's assumption proved dangerously wrong!'"
2,it's alright (2.5 Stars),"However, it's no Breathe. Fab's previous single Breathe really showcased his skills on the mic, but soft cuts like Baby don't do him much justice. He's a much better emcee than this song suggests, and he should really stick to spittin' the real stuff like Breathe."
4,Great powerhouse blender!,"This is my second purchase of the same blender and overall I love it. I had the first one for 3-4 years and I had to replace it as a key metal part broke. Note that I use the blender nearly every day (at least 5-6 days out of 7 each week) to make my breakfast shakes, which includes a lot of frozen fruit. So I really put blenders to the test. Unlike many other blenders on the market, this one still has solid metal parts.The only reason I didn't give this 5 stars is because the rubber sealing ring broke apart after just one month of use (whereas I never had to replace the ring on my previous blender used for 3-4 years). On the positive side, I called Oster customer service and they shipped out a pack of two replacement rings. If it were possible to give 4-1/2 stars, that's the rating I'd give to this blender.It is a bit loud, but for the few minutes a morning that I use it, I find the noise level tolerable. (My husband might disagree. :)"
1,Skip this book,"This book is replete with typographical errors - even the words ""call option"" written as ""can option"" - numerous times in an options book ??? !!! Shoddy publication!"
1,Garbage public domain crap!,Don't waste your money. Lousy prints with 4 films on one single sided disc. Avoid! Got it for 2.50 and that was too much.
4,dissolving the generation gap,This is a very moving account of a young girl who feels the need to reconnect with her roots. Cain was raised on a hippie commune in Iowa but as a college student in California feels estranged from her background. This spurs a decision to move back to Iowa to rediscover the little girl she was. It's a simple enough premise but it is very well written. Her mother's bout with melanoma is the impetus for the journey. Then there is the search for a former friend thought to be dead which adds texture to the tale. The road trip is a great American motif and Cain handles it in her own unique circumstances. This is a tale about self-rediscovery as Cain attempts to bridge a hippie past with the current gen X values. It is clich√© at times but very personal and honest. There is a lot of universal soil in this book. It can be appreciated by anyone who enjoys an honest account of dealing with illness and loss of innocence.
3,a quick read; worth the paper it's printed on,"In Dharma Girl, Chelsea Cain is trying to appeal both to the Gen X reader who is searching for some meaning in her life and to the aging hippie, nostalgic for life on the commune and hoping that it all made a difference somehow. The book is a quick read which I really did enjoy, even though I do not fit into either of the two categories above. The most engaging aspect of the book is the tension over whether she will be able to locate one of the commune members with whom she had a special friendship"
4,A Gen-X Girl Raised by a Hippie Mother,"Chelsea Cain is a gen-x girl with gen-x values. As a young woman she seeks to understand her place in the world.Raised by parents with a 1960's commitment to political liberalism and a hippie lifestyle, McCain wants to get a deeper understanding of her roots. To accomplish this, she travels back to Iowa with her mother. Iowa is where she spent her youth on a communal farm.The story is especially poignant because her mother is ill with melanoma (a serious form of cancer).The immediacy of her mother's melanoma and Chelsea's desire to understand her roots create an interesting and well-written memoir."
4,Action Adventure for the family!,Nice job creating a movie that was fun for Dad as well as his 7yo daughter! A sweet lessons of life story.
2,A star for each year it lasted,"I used this blender for about 2 years, and it did fine for light jobs. However, the motor would overheat if you used it for more than a minute at a time, so you would need to let it rest a bit. Eventually, the plastic piece that kept the shaft attached to the motor became unglued, and the motor stripped the blade-shaft attachment. Like I said, it worked okay for 2 years, so I got my money's worth out of it-- which wasn't really much. I'll spend a little more money next time for something that will hopefully last."
1,"Trash, Junk, Garbage",Will never buy another Oster product. Broke on 2nd use. Doesn't do anything as advertised. Probably the worst consumer appliance product ever. It is impossible to buy replacement parts. Can only go through their service centers which are not convenient and hard to work with. I can't believe this company is still in business. Absolutely horrible.
1,Broke!,Used this handheld blender for over a year. It was okay and worked well enough for soup. Recently developed trouble and shaft fell apart. Would not recommend.
1,THIS IS A PIECE OF JUNK,"I purchased two of these blenders, one for me and one for my mother. During the first use the plastic around the shaft cracked. I was making a smoothie (yogurt, ripe banana and milk...not tough). I returned it to the store and got a replacement. Meanwhile, my mother had the same and problem with hers and I had another crack on first use of my replacement. Needless to say I returned the 2 blenders and will probably never purchased another Oster product.....IT IS JUNK!"
1,Avoid this unit,"My first impression with this unit was not good. The seperate high and low buttons push into the housing to activate, and the surrounding housing has sharp edges, so it was uncomfortable. My second impression came when I tried to use the blender on a bean soup. I felt it was ineffective, that is until I realized that the blending blade had fallen off. After sifting through the soup, I found the blade, and tried to thread it back onto the shaft, but that didn't work -- the threads wouldn't hold.I did like the idea that the blender portion was seperate from the motor unit, and could be removed for cleaning."
1,I wish I could give it no stars METAL SHAVINGS ALERT,"Purchased a couple years ago and used twice (gently!) on pumpkin butter. Suction very strong, heavy to hold and MUST be rested after a minute of use. Yesterday I tried it on room temp cream cheese for a frosting. Metal shavings fell into the cheese after seconds of use. I had cleaned it and dried it before using, so I knew it was clean. I unlocked the shaft and at the gear point, there were metal shavings.Disgusted that I had to throw away food AND a barely used appliance. I read instructions, I care for my kitchen stuff, so this type of failure is unacceptable.My 10 year old Granny Fork makes good frosting. I will use that with a little elbow grease."
2,"hate to agree with everyone else, but don't waste your money","I thought I'd stumbled on a great piece of kitchen equipment. However, unless you plan to use it only on delicate liquids, it's simply not built to last. Frozen yogurt nearly did it in. Ice killed it. I guess I should have stuck to cream sauces and pre-pureed foods. I'm now researching better-made items to replace it."
1,Unbelievably bad blender,"It was difficult to use, got really hot too quickly, after 10 seconds started to smell horrible.I fought with it for 10 minutes (felt like 30) to make aioli, finally gave up after the 2nd full batch.We're throwing it out and getting a new one."
1,Bummed,"I'm so bummed. I've been wanting one of these for a long time...So I finally picked up one up to mix and blend quick items. After using it twice, the plastic case that houses the blade cracked. So now the bottom does not stay on. Can't find a replacement bottom piece and can't use this one. Another reminder we live in a disposable world. Too bad..."
1,Substandard,"After 1.5 years the housing around the blade cracked off while blending SPINACH SOUP! It wasn't concrete, just a lousy soup. This product was given to me as a gift and I quickly became a fan of the idea of an immersion blender. But like many things, you can start by wasting your money on a piece of garbage and then spend a third more the next time getting what will last for many years. Think before you buy this. It is poorly designed and lacks the power to do anything meaningful."
1,Absolute trash,"I can't believe that Oster would market a product that is this shoddy. It's shockingly bad. The parts don't fit together well, it's incredibly flimsy, and even mixing liquids, it rattles and reeks of overheated circuitry. It works, for now, but I'd be surprised if it lasted even a month. I'll never buy another product from Oster."
1,Amazon should remove this product from their site.,I agree with all the bad reviews. The only positive thing I can say is that mine did not break the first time I used it. It broke the 4th time I used it. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT.
1,I feel sorry for Oster!,"Dealing with the very nice Oster customer service folks, it's clear they have a piece of junk to deal with. They sent me one replacement, and (of course) that broke after I over-strained it...making a light salad dressing. If they don't give me a second replacement I'll buy a real stick blender. I wonder how many of these they've replaced. I actually think it's not badly MANUFACTURED, but a very, very poor design."
2,Loud As A Freight Train!,I picked this up at Target as I needed one quickly and this was all that was available. There are a couple of positives including that it is very powerful and I like the feature that the mixer detaches for cleaning. However this is erased by the fact that it is as loud as a freight train. I have to go to another room and close the door in the morning or I will wake the whole family when using it.
1,Nearly worthless,"Well, I came here looking for a replacement part, but I can see from these other reviews it wouldn't be worth the trouble. As others reported, the plastic housing that connects the metal shaft of the blade to the motor unit broke after 3 or 4 uses. A vertical crack that means you can't connect the parts. I managed to make the soup for my friend's 50th birthday by holding the two parts together while blending. What a mess. I hate to throw stuff in the landfill, but that's where this one is going."
1,Do Not Buy!!,"I bought this blender because the only other option was the KitchenAid immersion blender that cost $49. To me, that seemed like a lot to pay for such a small piece of equipment. I didn't even pay that much for my hand mixer. However, I quickly learned that in the world of immersion blenders, you get what you pay for. This Oster blender was used maybe 8 times. It didn't work well out of the box, but after only 8 times using it it no longer worked at all. I just went out and spent the $49 to buy the KitchenAid immersion blender, after having wasted $20 on the Oster blender. Don't make the same mistake I did. I've now spent a total of $69 on immersion blenders when I could have only spent $49 to begin with."
1,Awful and not worth it.,"This blender costs ~$20 for $29.99 you can get the Cuisinart.Cuisinart CSB-76 SmartStick 200-Watt Immersion Hand Blender, WhiteThis blender doesn't handle anything tougher than ice cream and it's almost as expensive as the vastly superior Cuisinart. Don't waste your money on an inferior product!"
1,"mine broke, just like everyone else's","I used it every morning for about two weeks to make fruit smoothies. This morning it started to vibrate so bad I could barely hold on to it. I tried to look inside and see if I could fix it, but the parts were so hot I couldn't touch them and I could see that it was grinding through a piece of rubber and dripping the remains into my drink. Yuck! Well, it finally went it the trash can with a big thud ( I threw it because I was so mad). Don't waste your money!!!!"
1,Don't buy it,"I didn't buy it, it was a gift. I used it 12 or 13 times before it disintegrated. A piece of plastic sheared off and went flying. If you use this item, please wear safety goggles."
1,a whiny blender,"The motor is more noisy than the Braun and GE immersion blenders, and it gives a sad little whine as it starts up and winds down, so I think there is a problem with the interface between the motor portion and detatchable blender portion. After blending for 15 seconds, the motor housing smells charred, so maybe there is a problem with the motor as well."
1,"NO POWER, BROKE AFTER A FEW USES","1) Not very powerful2) Broke after a few usesI have used this blender several times for making spreads and sauces and it is not very powerful. Just yesterday when I was cleaning the removable shaft, a lot of nasty brown liquid and bits of plastic(!?) was pouring out from the inside of the shaft!!I clean it thoroughly every time like I do all my other appliances. After reading the previous review, I suspect the gulk must be the cheap plastic wearing off!! Beware! This product can be a health hazard. Don't buy. If you already have it, you might want to run some water into the shaft and pour it out to see if nasty stuff comes out. I'm going to see to returning it or notifying the manufacturer."
1,Fell apart and burned me,"We've had this Oster 2613 hand held blender for less than six months and used it less than 10 times. The attachment head melted into the blender itself causing the attachment itself to melt off and fall into the potatoes being blended. My wife, not knowing why it fell out, grabbed the attachment from the potatoes and burned her fingers.The product is made in China."
1,Broke 2 shafts on soft food...,"I had a similar experience with two of these blenders as another reviewer. After the first one broke making milkshakes(the plastic housing that connects the shaft to the motor), Oster sent me a second one. This one broke in the same place making salad dressing - these just aren't designed very well.I would stir by hand before I would ever purchase another one of these..."
1,Ugh. Worst purchase ever,"This blender, regardless of what you make, sucks. I used it to blend cream of mushroom soup after everything was soft, cooked and perfect. The plastic housing broke after the second use of the blender. Poor, poor construction and quality."
1,Easy way to puree your $20,"I bought my Oster hand blender at a retail store in 2007. It quickly developed a hairline crack in the blender attachment housing, probably the same crack many others seem to complain about. Mine still minimally ""worked"" after the attachment broke, but has been a real pain to use due to the attachment coming apart. Furthermore, the blending/measuring cup that comes with it doesn't seem dishwasher safe. Mine eventually developed cracks and had to be thrown away. I can't find replacement accessories (attachments or cups) for sale anywhere, not even Oster's web site. It's not worth the trouble to call Oster for replacements, since they will probably break the same way. I'll just buy one of the higher recommended blenders of another brand."
1,as if they need another one star review,"I'm being redundant here, but have to add my two cents. I bought this for travel and vacation and used it probably about 12 times before it broke. I never used it with ice, only partially frozen fruit, yogurt and liquid ... the blade is strong enough to handle that just fine. But the metal spike that fits into the motor started to wobble and will no longer fit into the housing. Very disappointed."
3,"Decent content, poorly formatted","This product contains a wide variety of public domain literature, organized by author or type. But it comes across as rather cheaply made (odd capitalizations, word breaks)--it looks like someone cut and pasted the data from somewhere else, and didn't bother to reformat it afterwards. It's fine for the price, but I'd hardly call it a polished product."
3,"Not on Windows 7, no index or TOC","I cannot install on Windows 7. The installation just shows a flash movie, and connects me to a website [...] and then redirected.No clue as to what files are on the CD except by opening each .doc file in Word, and look. I sure expected a table of contents, a menu, or something.Like I have time to open a thousand files and write down the name (the file names are sometimes cryptic and make no sense). I've scoured the Internet for a cross reference, but for $7 I'm just not willing to go to a whole lot of trouble."
5,Just what I ordered,"I was pleased with the mower blade sent to me. It arrived timely and fit perfectly. Unfortunately, I've already dented it, so will be buying another one!"
1,Review of Refusal to Speak,"This book contains a collection of articles from the selective mutism literature up to the year 1995. With the exception of a few articles that are scientifically valid, the book is a compilation of misguided information. Even the title is misleading in that selective mutism has been defined by the American Psychiatric Association as a ""failure"" to speak and not a refusal to speak. Most of the new literature supporting the concept that selective mutism is an involuntary response to anxiety is absent."
1,Be kind and helpful. See books about shyness.,"Look up books using the keyword, shyness. Here are some I found at amazon.comBuster: The Very Shy Dog by Lisze Bechtold(Illustrator)Let's Talk About Being Shy (The Let's Talk Library) by Marianne JohnstonJ. Rooker, Manatee by Jan Haley, Paul Brent(Illustrator)The Shy Child : A Parent's Guide to Preventing and Overcoming Shyness from Infancy to Adulthood by Philip G. Zimbardo, Shirley L. RadlThese can be helpful. The book I'm reviewing IS more HARMFUL than helpful. I didn't order it. I read it at a library. It is awful and would increase feelings of inadequacy, anger, etc. which can make a person shy.School, insurance programs, medical programs, and so forth make a lot of money by having kids diagnosed so they can get money from the government. Remember, ""the government"" is our tax dollars and many of these dollars are spent unwisely!Buy some of the other great books at amazon.com about shyness but don't get this one!"
1,Horrible title,"Simply the title of this book makes me not want to purchase it. Selective Mutism is NOT a refusal to speak in social situations. Children with SM are not being defiant or refusing to speak, the are physically unable to speak in certain social situations. I did not nor would I waste money on this book, the title says it all..I'm sure it is as mis-guided as the other reviews say it is.My child has selective mutism, this book should be removed from Amazon."
1,Be very careful when reading this book,Be very careful when reading this book. A lot of the information is outdated and is considered incorect. I think you could hurt your family by following this books advice.
2,There are better options available for readers,"I was drawn to this book by the promise of experiencing or gaining familiarity with a new part of Paris, a city I have visited often. The book fell far short of that. It left me disappointed and longing for what I had missed. It was difficult to connect with or enter into the story primarily because the author failed to portray a personal intimacy with the subject. As an example, she tells us that moving within Paris was a bigger event than imagined but the description lacked emotional depth. Where were her feelings, little experiences, failings, successes, reactions. Overall, the author proved she has knowledge but does not know how to share it."
3,Into a Paris Quartier,"Nice book. The writing isn't very clever, nor humorous. Pretty straight forward. However, if one knows the 6th as I do, I found the book very informative and I felt like I learned a lot about this wonderful arrondisement! If you don't know the 6th district, I'd pass on reading the book. If you do, I think it's a must read."
1,"Get a Life, Please.",This book begins as a moderately interesting exploration of the history of St.-Germain. It rapidly degenerates into the inane detail of the life of a wealthy American woman who spends half her year in Paris. It concludes with a heavy dose of name-dropping.
1,Don't buy this book!,"I have been taking ballroom dancing for almost two years. I started my study of ballroom dancing in Japan, and as a result of language and cultural barriers, I thought I needed a book, written in English, that would compliment my study of dance. So, I purchased this book. It was the worst purchase I have ever made! The pictures are not the least bit useful for learning steps. The description of the steps and the foot diagrams are confusing (and in some cases wrong). The only good thing about the book is the section on the history of ballroom dancing, but except for that the book is extreamely limited. Don't waste your money like I did, there are alot of good ballroom dance books out there, but it is certainly not this one!"
3,Complete Book of Ballroom Dancing,Good book but wished it had more illustrations. I felt it did not haveenough pictures for each dance that was mentioned.
3,ummm,"ummmm...well, there was a fernando bustamente piece that was really really good. I liked it a lot. but not too much else. it was not so much his playing but rather the compositions. they were not my cup of tea. that's about it."
1,LOOK ELSEWHERE,"All of his collection are wonderful examples of how NOT to play these pieces! If you want to hear how they should be played, check out David Russell, Manuel Barrueco or (usually) Julian Bream or Andres Segovia performances."
1,Hardly recognizable repertoire,"While Mr. Scheeweiss plays with a great deal of passion, none of that passion belongs to the original composers of the pieces. He severely alters the pieces rhythmically and melodically to the point where they no longer hold any of the original essence of the composer. I am an outspoken proponent of personal interpretation, but I believe the composer's initial design should be respected to the best of one's ability; Mr Schneeweiss should focus on composing rather than modifying existing repertoire, or show more respect to the composers who blessed us with their music."
5,Wonderful Piedmont Blues,"Buddy Moss was one of the great neglected figures of the East Coast blues scene in the 1930s. He recorded with Blind Willie Mc Tell & Curley Weaver between 1933 & 1935, and was set for stardom when he murdered his wife and was jailed. Released in 1940, he had missed his chance. Blind Boy Fuller had cornered the market, and the superior Moss was marginalised. Rediscovered in the 1960s he again did not achieve the fame he deserved, and died deeply disillusioned by the music business.This CD shows better than any other what a magnificent player he was. Seventeen of the twenty two tracks feature Moss performing solo blues and demonstrate his utter mastery of the Piedmont style later associated with Fuller. Ragtime influenced and swinging but with deep blues feeling, his guitar playing is magnificent, and expertly complements his baritone voice.Strongly recommended."
1,Not impressed at all,"I have owned an HP320 for years and have been very happy with it. I decided to once again go with HP for my new camera, and bought an M415 because of the 5.2 megapixel and the price. Mistake. The pics are blurry, the focus is off and the batteries don't last more than one setting of pictures. The flash takes a good 6-7 seconds to recharge and I've missed shots because of it. The HP support people are Indian and I can't understand them, so they are no help to me at all.I'm trading it in for a Canon tomorrow."
1,"fuzzy image, poor battery efficiency","i bought this just because it is a 5M pixels camera, but it turns out to be a big disappointment.i bought another canon A410 3M too, its way shaper and clearer than HP. i tried tripod, highest resolution, but the HP pic is always blurred(like a piece of white paper), espically for portrait mode. guess its because their little tricks ---""lower the sharperness and make it natural"".2AA batteries are only good for 20 pics.will return it, and go for japanese cameras."
3,Great photos. Eats batteries.,"I previously had an HP digital camera and it took great photos. It got dropped and broken. I bought the M415 for office and work use. It takes good photos, sharp and clear. The video clips are fuzzy, but great to add to a presentation. The transition between photos requiring flash is very slow and this camera eats batteries. In the four years I have had this camera, I have probably spent at least twice as much on batteries as I paid for the camera."
3,Cute Story,"To Oz and Back is a delightful story that's easy to read and helps bring some awareness of Asperger's Syndrome, which is a mild form of autism. One caveat, however, is that the author speaks only about the female protagonist's Asperger's Syndrome, so one who is not familiar with the condition shouldn't assume that all ""Aspies"" are the same way. This story is especially of interest for children from 7-14 and anyone who likes mysteries"
2,kind of boring,i like to read fiction books about aspergers to see how accrate they are. in this one the AS really only palys a minor part in the story. i think it would have been a better book if the duchess had narrated it.
3,Good acting with so-so results,I appreciate the story line and the irony of a priest being held by Catholics who are members of the Irish Republican Army. The movie starts off with a twist when the wrong priest is kidnapped. I thought the lead actor was a very good and convincing actor but at times was confused by his and the IRA's actions. It was not made 100% clear why the Priest made the decision that he did in the end of the film to stay with the rest of the IRA members as well as walk out in civilian clothes. I could definitely watch the movie again and did not mind how it ended but was hoping to get some more clarity on why things turned out the way they did.
1,Does not work for Iphone,While this product will work with your older Ipods it will not work with any iphone model and will not charge them.
1,UNUSABLE UNLESS YOU OWN AN OLDER IPOD,"I used this charger on planes for my IPOD 2G. However, when I purchased my IPOD 3G, it was no longer compatible. It's also not compatible with the IPOD TOUCH or any IPHONES, or the IPAD. Where do they tell you this? They don't. I don't know why they haven't upgraded the monster cable iplay for use with the newer products."
1,doesn't work with ipod touch or iphone,I recently bought this to use on a long flight to recharge my iphone 3G and my daughter's ipod touch however both devices says it doesn't support this accessory. I tried using it with the auto charger and got the same message. Waste of money.
1,Does not work on Boeing 737 or Airbus 320,"Before you read this, please note that this device includes a cigarette lighter adapter so you can still charge your iPod in your vehicle. The plugin clip is wider than most other connectors I own so if you have a case on it then it could be difficult to fit on and off. (iSkin owners be cautious. It will fit, but it takes a bit of work to get on and off.)I had purchased this device to keep my iPod charged during a recent trip. Flew on Southwest (Boeing 737) to my destination and then United (Airbus 320) back home. Both planes did not have the appropriate plug for the charger. The flight attendants were not aware if the plane had this plug. Either it was located in an obscure location or the attendants just didn't know.If you can find this item for dirt cheap then it isn't that bad. I paid $7 (w/ S&H;) so I didn't get burned too bad."
4,FM I-Pod Transmitter,Better than most items I have tried to use for my I-Pod. Less static but not totally clear reception. I would probably buy another for my other vehicle.
4,Really enjoyed this CD,I really enjoyed listening to this CD. Quite a bunch of incredibly talented musicians and slick production. Many lyrics were a bit different.
5,A great documentary of rally during the begining of it's golden years.,This movie is a great very complete telling of the stories of important aspects of the world of rallying during the 70's. Interpersonal enough to tell some of the stories behind the scenes that the teams and drivers struggled with but still informative enough to tell who won which races and why with out getting boring. You can also purchase this DVD used on the UK amazon for about 20 bucks including shipping. Simply type [...] in your web browser.
1,Luggage woes,"We ordered the 5 piece tote twice and both times it arrived at our house with pieces broken off of the largest suitcase. If this suitcase can not even survive shipping from the manufacturer inside of a box with bubble wrap, then I doubt it will hold up on any airline baggage conveyor belt! I also suspect (but can not prove) that after I returned the first set of luggage due to damage and requested a replacement set, that the same set was shipped back to me again because the broken piece was in the same area! For the second return I just requested a refund."
2,"Good Review, Horrible Explanations.","This is an okay book, it has a good review(and not very long like Barron's book), good questions, and adequete tips for both the multiple choice [section] and the free response. One big problem I had with this book is that there are NO explanations for any of the answers to the questions. If there is a review book for any test and no explanations for any of the answers it hase a serious problem. Also, there wasn't anything that showed you how to grade the practice tests, not even how to calculate a raw score. At least show us how to calculate a raw score, then we will have just some idea of how well we are doing. If you are going to buy this book I would suggest buying either Litvin's or Barron's (though it reteaches you the material) book along with this book."
5,"Great book, great condition, great bargain.",This Atlas was worth much more than I paid for it. It is in near mint condition. It is exactly what I need to aid my study of Ancient History.
4,"Excellent Resource, but in Need of an Update","I enjoy the ""Hidden"" series of travel guides and this one does not dissappoint. It is both useful and entertaining and well worth purchasing. However, the last edition was 2004, so be sure an double-check any attractions beforehand to see if they are still open and located where they were seven years ago. Otherwise, you can go miles out of your way to discover a closed resteraunt or relocated park entrance."
2,A real...yawn...disappointment.,"A really disappointing offering from Klein & the Hamburg Soloists, who have provided us with an excellent set of Haydn's Divertimenti. The playing is beautiful and totally immaculate, but these are old-school German performances...slow, heavy and virtually guaranteed to cause sleepiness. Now I am not fanatical on authentic performance practices, but one thing I do appreciate is the quick tempos and accent on liveliness the authenticists have brought. Klein is more along the lines of the old Karajan/Ritcher school of the 50s and 60s, emphasizing weightiness and dignity. If you like that kind of playing, you will like these performances. Otherwise, you will not (as I have not). Next purchase...Opus 6 by I Musici de Montreal."
2,"Even in for a traditional approach, this is really...","...disappointing.Despite immaculate playing, beautiful string sound, and excellent engineering, you get.... . .precious performances that feel like they are being served under glass. Don't touch. It's not real...alive...it's just, well, there. And it lasts a very l o n g time. Much longer than what three CDs usually play for...... Very s l o w.Disappointing, given that Klein and these forces have given us some good to excellent recordings. Oh well. One must try Manze and the Academy of Ancient Music (Harmonia Mundi) for a musical feast that delights the ears, the mind, and the heart. Save your nickels for that set!"
3,Not that irreverent...,"What I love most about the irreverent guides (I own the ones for Boston and for SF) is that they're straight forward, quick-witted, and give you very interesting tidbits about local history. It's like getting the inside scoop from your best friend vs the information kiosk.So the fact that the sharp wit is missing from the Chicago guide is a nuisance. In fact, I really can't say it's irreverent or funny at all. Almost as if someone from Frommer's traditional guide staff -- or perhaps, an attendant at the information kiosk -- wrote it. The recommendations are good enough, but if you're looking for humor to go along with it, you won't find it here."
3,irreverent guide to chicago,disappointing to say the least - much of the book looked as if it had been recopied at kinko's. the maps were extremely hard to read - no color at all. i can't quite figure what's supposed to be irreverent in the book unless it's the fact that every so often the author says something less than favorable about a site or restaurant. save your money.
2,Not what I expected,"This book was more on personal experiences by Dr.Dyer, It didn't guide me, as his book of 101 Ways to Transform Your Life."
4,"Weird name, fantastic music","Danish singer-songwriter, Teitur's debut album, Poetry and Aeroplanes is a beautiful cascade of delicate introspection and concise songwriting. His buttery vocals and penchant for sunny optimism insure easy-listening a la Jack Johnson but his ornate melodic embellishment evoke the complexity of Jeff Buckley and Travis. Teitur's particular brand of white soul is relaxing yet consistently intellectually compelling; Poetry and Aeroplanes may be the thinking-consumer's massage music. Most of the numbers feature an intimate vocal and acoustic guitar track while a surrounding flurry of strings, keyboards, and drumtracks daintily accentuate the main action. It's like David Gray sans angst. The standout track is ""Josephine"" an unashamedly gorgeous number whose sheer prettiness is matched only by its wit. If Poetry and Aeroplanes is any indication of the future, Teitur has a long and enduring career to come."
5,Simply Amazing,Finally an album and an artist worth listening. What an amazing first album. I listen to Poetry & Aeroplanes non-stop. I highly recomend looking him up on VH1.com and watching the videos of his studio performances. Simply Amazing.
5,Beautiful,"I picked up this CD after a friend shared an mp3 of ""I Was Just Thinking"" - one of my favorite tracks on the album. trust me, though, there is not one song that is lacking here. from the lyrics to the melodies to his incredible, crystal clear voice, i have not been able to stop playing his album since november. do yourself a favor. pick it up."
1,are we talkin' about the same album?,I recently got a free copy of this. I can't stand this album. I was curious to see what others thought about it. I'm shocked and amazed to read what others wrote. I'm at a loss as to how these reviewers are saying great things about it.I guess I'm alone in thinking this is a bland album. but hey everyone can have there own opinion. My opinion is that this is a waste of time. I wouldn't recommend this album to my worst enemy.
4,A beautiful album.,"Teitur's ""Poetry & Aeroplanes"" is an excellent album. The lyrics are touching, especially in ""I Was Just Thinking"". This song is a memorable tribute to a missed lover. The whole album is outstanding. The album's title track, ""Poetry & Aeroplanes"" is my favorite. Teitur's voice glides smoothly over the notes, and they lyrics are amazing. This album is a must-have for fans of any type of music."
5,Sublime Beauty,"I've heard Teitur compared to artists like John Mayer, but I have to say that, with all due respect, Mr. Mayer has NOTHING on Teitur.That means no disrespect to John Mayer, who has some real talent hiding beneath his poppish sheen. Check out some of his earlier, acoustic work before 'Room For Squares' - it's really darn good.But anyway, Teitur. This album is one of the greatest I've heard in the past four years, and it's one of the only new albums I've heard that I still listen to over and over again over a year after I purchased it. From the very beginning of ""Sleeping with the Lights On"", I am hooked - and I stay that way throughout the album. (with the exception of the uninspired 'Josephine' that acts as a real mood-killer.) You're the Ocean is an utterly phenominal song, and I recommend this album to anyone who likes driving at night and just letting the music take them along for the ride."
5,Poetry at its very best,This is the very music you want to listen to if you are far away and longing home to your love ones.It's music from the heart of one of our very finest new poets. This is the album you should't miss. Relax and enjoy.
3,A good CD although somewhat repetitve in sound,"I bought this CD because his one song ""Sleep with the Lights On"" was the free song on iTunes one week. I liked that song so much that I decided to try the entire CD. While each song is good, there is not too much on the CD that truly stands out. It will always be a CD that I enjoy listening to but it will never be my favorite. It is mellow and calming and I will use it as good background music."
5,one of 2003's gems,"This CD is just *wonderful* -- I cannot stop playing it, and when I'm listening to it -- I find that I can't pay attention to much else - I'm so drawn into the music. Sometimes his voice/style reminds me a little of Paul Simon, other times a little like Sting ... but the whole package (instrumentation too!) is definitely unique, fresh, and a true gift. I cannot wait to hear Teitur live (this month! can't wait)..."
1,One of the worst horror films I have ever seen!!!,Speechlessly disappointed!!! Why made a film so messy like this!!!
3,Decent low budget horror from talented director,"As a fan of J.T. Petty's The Burrowers, I wanted to check out his other work. His direction more so than his writing really struck me, although The Burrowers is an impressive film and recommended viewing for horror fans. Mimic Sentinel is not quite as successful and heavily influenced by Hitchcock's Rear Window, which provides a nice platform for Petty to show off his talented eye for setting up shots and capturing a dark and creepy mood. The film has a compelling sense of style, which overshadows the merely functional dialogue. Unsurprisingly, Mimic Sentinel was put together quickly and on minimal budget. The haste in which the film was made might be the best excuse for the perfunctory, rather unbelievable climax. As a writer/director, Petty either needs to amp up the writing a bit or find help. As a director, Petty has a great eye and is someone to look out for."
3,"""Rear Window"" Meets ""THEM""","This is the third entry in the Mimic series; this time a shut-in and his hoochie sister have a run-in with the giant cockroaches. The movie starts off slow, maybe too slow in my opinion, but Mimic 3 gets real good at the end. The whole picture has this grungy look, contrasting the main character's immediate surroundings and lifestyle."
3,Don't be so hard on it!,"Ok, the style of the first two films in the trilogy was really cool. Very dark and moody. The style of this one doesn't remain consistent with the frist 2, but it's just as good I think. There are alot of close ups, it's hard to describe. Don't compare this to big budget films. All horror fans will be pleased to see that Lance Henriksen who happens to be a B-Movie actor now, makes an appearence as a sort of bad guy? I guess. I think that watching some of the special features will help you to respect a movie better, and I'm not sure if there's a commentary or anything, but I've talked to the director alot over e-mail and he's a really nice guy. He has written the stories for the Splinter Cell games and is currently writing the movie, so if you don't like him for this, than like him for that."
3,Rear Window and the Judas Breed,"This is the weakest of the Mimic movies. A young man (23ish) is living the life of a bubble boy. Surviving Strickler's disease has left him with respiratory problems. To bide his time he takes pictures of the neighbors in the building across the way. His younger sister helps him with his hobby. But then a young boy disappears.As the guy becomes more and more obsessed with the neighbors he sees a possible murder. He doesn't realize that the Judas Breed is behind it, but he does get the police involved. Things quickly build an it becomes obvious that the big bugs are back.I am not sure of the ending in this one. It is a little vague. If one character was right, then the Judas has already won and humans will be wiped out. It also seemed like there was something missing from the film. Something that would explain what was going on with the birds.Much different from either of the first two and worth seeing once but probably not more."
5,Stands On Its Own [Six] Legs,Highly artistic and stylish entry in the series that boasts strong direction from JT Petty. Much more suspenseful than your typical direct-to-video fare. Good cinematography and acting.I personally feel that this is an appropriate and highly satisfying close to the trilogy. It's great to see a survivor of Strickler's disease triumph over the Judas Breed.
4,Nice and powerful,This food processor looks great and handles a lot of food. The 10 cup capacity is great. It has a powerful motor and easliy grates a lot of cheese very quickly. I would highly recommend it.
5,Yes! it's YES!,"Yes' best album is now here...digitally re-mastered and with extra tracks. Listen to classic hits like ""Owner of a Lonely Heart"", ""Changes"", ""Hold On"", ""Leave It"" & ""City of Love"" Truly the best. I also have this on 33 1/3 RPM as well."
4,Yes Reinvents Themselves,"This is a good album, though perhaps not the masterpiece that many have made it out to be. I don't believe it's on par with their 70's prog classics, but it is good, and the right kind of thing if you are looking for something a bit different in the Yes catalog. Owner of A Lonely Heart is, of course, one of the band's best tracks. The intro just kicks, and the guitar riff is classic. But not only that, the song is perfectly conceived. The other instruments come in at just the right time, it is a joy to listen to. Also, Our Song is a very good song, with some excellent synth work from Tony Kaye. Cinema (the original name of this band... it was supposed to be a side project with Rabin/Horn and Squire/White, then Anderson joined in) is a nice instrumental. There is also a rarity for Yes on this album: lyrics that make sense. Owner, Hold On, and It Can Happen in particular, have some pretty good lyrics in them. Reccommended if you like Yes with a twist."
3,Yes is Truly Dead,"This album is okay, but not Yes. I would much rather hear Relayer thatn this album. Owner is the only perfect song, the rest are either okay or stupid. Changes is great exept for the pointless keyboard intro which is the same chord progresion on a xylaphone and piano over and over again for about 3 minuts, which is the entire first half of the song. Hold On, and Cinema are okay, Hearts, It Can Happen and City of Love are all stupid. (""Soon"" from The Gates of Deliriem was a much better slow-soft composition from Yes) When I heard Leave it, all I could think was ""What the !@#$ is this?"". Leave it has no rock in it. It's just pure pop or disko or whatever, but not rock. Overall, this Album is okay,but not great, and not Yes."
2,Subtitle: Yes Sells Out!,"When I first heard 90125 back in the early 80s, I was appalled at its ""modern"" nature: Generic rhythms, cliched guitar riffs and a pop feel that is a far cry from progressive classics like Close To The Edge. While the only positive thing I can say about the CD is sound quality, 90125 now sounds embarassingly dated in the same vein as most 80s one-hit wonders.Of course, this grossly overrated album was without the talents of Bill Bruford -- who must have gawked when he heard the opening to the lame disco-ish ""Leave It"" -- and Steve Howe. Here, Howe's touch is missed, as Trevor Ravin either throw in unoriginal solos or rips off Howe himself (the solo in ""Changes"").I'm sure that there are those who will defend 90125 to no end, but to those accustomed to Yes when they were taking chances and following their own lead instead of succumbing to the pop music fads & trends of this period, to this day, I still cannot call 90125 a YES album without wincing."
2,A loudmouth progressive rock fan with an arrogant opinion.,"This should have never been a Yes album. Chris Squire and Alan White had the right idea when this project was started as a new band called ""Cinema."" Unfortunately, things got ugly when this turned into a Yes project. As such, this is a parody of Yes' glory days, when they were a band that was once known for their brilliance and their originality.I like intelligent pop music, but 90125 is too cheesy for my tastes. The album waxes insipid lyrical subjects and corny keyboard sounds that gave 80's pop a bad name. The rocking songs have no hooks, and the ballads lack the beauty that made tracks like ""Turn of the Century"" so pleasant. Strictly on a basis of musicality, the album is average (thus banal) adult pop. I have to admit that a few of the tracks of moderate interest, like ""Leave It"" and ""Changes,"" but the rest - even the 'classic' ""Owner of a Lonely Heart"" - leaves a bad taste in my mouth."
2,Pop music.,"If you're a ""pop"" fan, buy this album. If you like Yes' ""hits"" the best, like Roundabout, and Owner of a Lonely Heart, get this. If you love synthesizers, this is the album for you. But if you want to hear what Yes is about, buy Close to the Edge or Time and a Word. Like almost every band (Beatles excluded), their earlier stuff is their best."
2,Competent,"Competent pop album thats saved by imaginative production and arrangements. However, it ruined Yes reputation of as a respected progressive rock band and transformed them into a one hit wonder phenomenon, something they are still struggling with."
3,Good but somewhat forgettable after a while,"Believe it or not I somewhat agree with Mister Max on this one. Where this is basically a good album with several good songs, right now in the year 2000, this record is somewhat forgotten. Why? Because Yes strayed from what they do best which is right long symphonic mood pieces. Whereas many of those Yes Songs weared on my patience, at least it was a bit more natural sounding than this batch of songs. However the change had some good for Yes as it opened up a new audience for them. How long can you do symphonic length pieces for anyway. A nice collection yes, fanststic and a most for every record collection, I think not."
5,Yes Changes again and this time it pays off!,This early 80's album with the great Trevor Rabin still holds up and it has proven that it was always a very strong effort for Yes and it is the reason they are still around today.
4,The Best of YES,"Yes is a band Britannic progressive rock. I remember in 1983 when it was in their training:Jon Anderson (vocals),Trevor Rabin (guitar and vocals) Tony Kaye (keyboard)Chris Squire (bass)and Alan White (drums).Was when I heard ""Owner of a Lonely Heart "" and Hold On "",composed by Trevor Rabin and Tony Kaye. I recently bought the CD 90125 through the group Yes (amazon)that arrived at my house day 01/10/2012.I recommend anyone who likes progressive rock of the years ""80"" and fans of the band Yes they can purchase this disc because it comes with all original songs remastered."
4,Yes mucis as I knew it in 1983,"Corny lyrics, but excellent musicians, pop music that helped define MTV in it's heyday, overall fun to listen to if you enjoy thinking about the music you liked when you were 15 or 16!"
3,Good and diverse,"Yes was always known for diveristy but with 90125 they had yet another different lineup but it produced their most well known work. The driving opening of guitar on Owner of a Lonely Heart hits and drives the song and the desperate high-pitch of Anderson's voice with changes in musical pitch throughout gives the emotional connection. The other well-known song on here is Leave It and the CD contains various versions the band recorded. The song showed range of the groups vocals. It Could Happen and Change are other stand-out songs. The rest of the CD is OK as a couple of songs take away from the CD becoming a classic. But overall, stands up well to other YES CD's like Fragile (although can't compare the two because the guital work of Steve Howe is much different than Trevor Rabin even though both are on the same musical page)."
2,average,most of the material here is dated synth work outs that were hot in 83 but sound stale now.however the first single still holds up to this day Owner of a Lonely Heart.the song still sounds as fresh today as it did almost 20 years back.but most of the album sounds formula driven there after.
4,"Best Yes album since ""Fragile""","It was a long decade full of personnel changes and boatloads of bad albums between 1972's classic ""Fragile"" and 1983's ""90125."" The first song ""Owner of a Lonely Heart"" is the best single of Yes's career and landed the band in heavy rotation on MTV. The rest of the album isn't bad either, though as with most Yes albums it could use a little more rock energy. Credit new guitarist Trevor Rabin for jump strating the dead Yes battery and breathing new life into the band. Overall, a fine comeback effort."
1,"Not YES, forget it- GARBAGE.","For any ""true"" YES fan, this album marked the apparent end of everything. Trevor Rabin completely took hold of the music, and the band followed, but it was no longer YES. By the end, Trevor Rabin's head had inflated to the degree that HE was playing keyboard on stage and not Tony Kaye- the ultimate insult.Every song reflects the new technologies generating at the time, and exactly what the REAL YES loved to avoid- shorter precise cuts that were good for a larger, radio-distracted audience! HOWEVER, had Jon NOT decided to do vocals and the band kept the name ""Cinema"" (the original idea), I think the effort would have been listenable. But to hear Jon singing ""Owner of a Trevor Rabin heart"" is just pathetic. The album, now over 22 years old, has stood the test of time because it had a major market impact. But the real YES would have burned this album to the ground. Get ABWH instead. (1989)"
1,YES (1980'S),this cd was a real disappointment....it has a definite 80's sound and none of the greatness of the earlier YES was present....
1,Worst uncomparable to Close to the Edge,I't only a bored pop album... Yes cann't create an impressive progressive music at all. There creativity has been deminished.
4,How bad sounds go good,"With 90125, Yes accomplished something rarely achieved in the entire 1980's. They actually took this simpler synth-heavy, plasticized-production era, which had robbed so many a great band of their compositional dignity, and made it work in their progressive favor. Purists surely were turned off initially, but taken as objectively as possible it's hard to deny how much of the record is so successfully fused together, if a little sickly sweet in moments."
3,Nice album but remastering has flaws,"90125 is quite a nice album from Yes, but it is a little bit too commercial for me. The sound of this remastered version is quite detailed, but as all my other HDCD's quite aggressive in the high frequencies. Also the mastering is way too loud (as lots of (remastered) CD's nowadays), limiting the dynamic range, which is soo important for the music of Yes."
3,Rabin rescued the band...,"from fading into obscurity but at the expense of their classic sound. You have to do what you have to do though, right? Good melodies, bizarre videos, strange lyrics. Not too bad of a record."
3,Hardly a Yes album,"This is a great pop album, full of lovely hooks and great production. Unfortunately, it's boring to those of us who love early Yes. Call me an elitist, but this album signifies a huge step backward for the band, dropping back into the area of pop rock. On this album, Yes completely abandons their traditional sound, relying on ""traditional"" pop lyrics and bland hooks. The music is incredibly dull. The absence of Howe is painfully noticeable, and the average keyboard work of Tony Kaye simply cannot match the exceptional soundscapes of Wakeman or Moraz. To its credit, though, it is a wonderful pop album, and Trevor Horn's production is crisp and clear. However, those who like Yes' earlier material will probably feel alienated (maybe even betrayed) by this album's lack of direction or purpose. Ah well, all good things must come to an end."
3,"Yes, a comeback.","After dismembering, Yes made a ""great"" comeback with 90125. I was 12 or 13 then and had already some knowledge of the old Yes albums, so this one really disappointed me at that time because eventhough this Yes lineup incorporated the veteran like Tony Kaye they had lost the ""progressive"" rythm that I liked so much.Later I came to appreciate ""Owner of a lonely heart"", ""It can happen"", and ""Leave it"". They are good songs, and I still enjoy them today, as well as their videos, but the rest of the album could be ripped off without causing serious damage to the history of music."
1,Yaaaaaaaaaaaawwwwwwwwwwwwwwnnnnnnnnnnnn!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"What a yawnfest! This movie was as boring as The Godfather was fascinating. The acting and music were good. The direction, the pacing, the action, etc were off-the mark. The director claims to have been inspired by The Godfather but lame rip offs of some of the plot is hardly inspiration.The Godfather is a classic for so many reasons. Among them, the conceits, the catch-phrases, and the brutal violence. Sarkar lacks all of them. The violence is not convincing. The actors may as well have got up and walked off after they were shot dead.What a waste of time, talent and film."
1,A stupid heroine? A dumb damsel?,"Any amount of enjoyment of this book is largely overshadowed by the reader's overwhelming disbelief at such blatant stupdity on Roe's part. Although 1996 (published date) seems like a long time ago, they DID have *69 and a little gadget called Caller ID. Yet Roe continues to be intimidated by hang up calls and a spooky caller asking, ""Are you alone?"". Man, that *69 should have been a done deal with her next breath (they even have nifty software that will block unidentified-numbered calls from being put through...wow!). But nope, she has to be the proverbial dumb damsel. This kind of writing is an insult to women everywhere. Please, save yourself the frustration at such stupidity and read elsewhere!"
3,Oy! [possible spoilers],"Although an engaging read, this installment of the Aurora Teagarden series is the weakest. The initial shocking discovery of the body (tossed out of a low-flying plane onto Aurora's backyard) turns out to have a questionable motive behind it. When the killer is unmasked, I found myself having to stretch my disbelief beyond the breaking point. Simply put, the killer's motivation is atypical to the character. It's a good read for those who enjoy her works, but if you had to skip one, this would be it."
4,Love this series!,"I love this series. I enjoyed this series more than the ever so popular Sookie Stackhouse series. It's not as much a supernatural mystery series, more realistic. Aurora is likable."
4,enjoyable fluff for Teagarden fans,"This is the 5th in a series of mysteries about Aurora Teagarden, a librarian who has come into some money and lives among her family and friends (and a few enemies) in Lawrenceton, GA. This time out she is minding her own business when a body is dropped from a small plane and onto her newly mown lawn; it turns out to be a policeman who feuded with Roeon numerous occasions. After other killings continue to point to Roe or her household, she decides to get serious and figure out who the real killer is, of course!Aurora and her circle of acquaintances are interesting characters, but this 5th in the series was neither believable nor particularly amusing. Many people are killed and the ending wraps up very quickly and without full motivation for some of the occurences. A good series, but a subpar outing."
1,Haven't received it yet,I can't wait to get it because I love Ms. Harris' books and this series in particular. Hope it arrives soon!
4,Entertaining,"It was reading at a fast pace, none of the drawn out paragraphs that makes me want to take another break from reading.Kept the mind thinking"
2,Just not believable,"I, too, am a major Charlaine Harris fan. I love Sookie, the Lily Bard series and am warming up to the Harper series. These are my least favorite, so I may have a bit of negative bias. But, I got sick to death of reading about teeny tiny ""Roe"" and her masses of long hair, and I absolutely cannot believe that she is generating all of the amorous interest that she suddenly is (it's probably that inheritance), nor can I believe the effect of that amorous interest as played out in this book. If you've not read Harris, please, SO NOT start w/ this series! As for me, I'll probably plow through the rest 'cause that's what a major fan does, but the star is burning just a bit less brightly for having written this one.P.S. Martin does nothing for me (a least one reviewer wrote ""one-dimensional,"" which I agree w/), but good grief, he's only in his late 40s -- Harris writes about him like he's ancient!"
4,she is a great author and I have read every book of hers,Charlaine Harris has a gift. She is able to write a story and put you right into the events as they unfold. She tells details that make you see the characters and the areas they are in. I love her books and wish I could find more. As far as I know I have read them all.
4,Short But Sweet,"Socrates was important as a cultural figure who showed other people how to be a philosopher. Much of this entertaining account talks about Socrates' lifestyle and personality. There are amusing little vignettes, such as how Socrates fended off the homosexual advances of the much younger Alcibiades, who later became a traitor to Athens.The book emphasizes that Socrates did not advance his own positions as much as he criticized those of others.Now that I have read this shorter work on Socrates I feel prepared to move on to longer works on Plato and Aristotle."
5,"Best Personal Lubricant on the Market, and best Value","Probe is hands down the best lube I've ever used. It's very viscous, and slippery, and coats anything you apply it to. Approved by the FDA for Anal, Vaginal, or Oral use, probe has practically no taste, and doesn't stain clothing at all. Makes insertion of toys easy, leaving only the pleasure of stretching muscles rather than friction and dragging. Glycerin based, so you'll probably want to avoid using it vaginally if glycerin causes you to have yeast infections, but for anal usage it's a great way to protect your delicate anal lining. Only problem is it does dry out if exposed to open air, but a few drops of water will make it slippery as if you just pumped it out of the bottle. It's great to use in the shower as the humidity will keep it slick. Probe is safe for any kind of toy, and condoms of course. 5 stars with no reservations!"
2,Not At All What Was Decribed,I was looking for a book on fiber glassing a fishing vessel and ended up with a sail boat repair manual. Very little on fiber glassing period. Very disappointed.
2,Not For Belly Dancers,"The saying goes...if you don't have anything nice to say, don't say anything. So this is going to be tough. The nice things about this video:1. 30 minutes of continuous shimmying2. Proper form isn't required so no prior belly dance experience is necessary3. The music isn't traditional belly dance music, so if you're sick of Zeina, this DVD might work for you4. The production value is low, keeping the cost just as low5. You will learn how NOT to shimmyThere. I said nice things. If you are trying to learn how to belly dance, and not just jiggle around for 30 minutes, may I suggest Michelle Joyce's DVD collection?"
2,I don't like...,"Rania is very tense, like a soldier. The group execut some movements without care... If you are a beginner, you can hurt your knees, for example..."
4,Lots of Fun,"I love this set- it is fun, but also makes you sweat. It's really helped tone the sides of my belly, and after a pregnancy and cesarean, I was hoping it would! The bonus performances by Rania are just so cool to watch too.The first time through, I felt kind of silly, and constantly a half step behind, but after a couple times, you really get a feel for the moves- so if you feel discouraged at first, don't!Just have fun with it. Overall, a great workout."
4,Fun but not too hard,"I like all 4 of these workout because they are fun but still feel like a workout. I have dance experience so I found them a bit easy, but they still made me sweat. I wouldn't rely solely on these tapes as my only workout but they are short enought to piggyback with another more cardio intense workout."
3,It could be worse,"The first few times I tried these they were difficult, but after awhile they became too easy. Not bad for a beginer (especially one who has no rhythm and cannont dance)but oer all not great."
2,Boring Bellydance,"Let me start by saying I think Rania is an excellent dancer; her performances at the end are fantastic. But her instruction left a lot to be desired. She looked uneasy and stiff and the background dancers were stiff and cheesy. The music was just plain awful, especially in Pure Sweat and Cardio Shimmy.The workouts are boring, but I still enjoy her performances. The bonus workouts are OK. I will stick with Neena and Veena."
3,If it was longer.............,"I tried all these videos, I must admit it is quite fun, but a little hard trying to get those foot moves down pat. But once you do, you can do it to the beat without even looking at the video. I found it just a bit weird that Rania doesnt talk you thru it while she is doing it, she narriates it...you'll see. If the workout was longer then 25 minutes, I would probably enjoy it alot more for my basic workout. But overall I did have fun doing some hip drops and I find myself popping my hips whenever I can."
3,Not going to impress a dancer,"Certainly aimed at someone looking for a step-class style workout. She does introduce bellydance movements and compose combinations but they are probably not the sort of combinations would take with you to the dance floor. She will give you combinations of about 4 eight-counts a piece and you will repeat them over and over for the length of a song. Rania is a very beautiful dancer so I expected a little more.Even as a workout, they were pretty slow, I didn't feel like I had worked up to cardiovascular benefit personally (I am 25 but I am not sure if that makes a whole lot of difference).There are some performance peices on the dvd but the Bellydance Superstars dvd has better ones, in my opinion.If you want to spice up your step-class workout- you might enjoy these but if you are hoping to learn how to bellydance, I would recommend something else."
4,Belly Dance for fitness,Great set of dvds. Can go kind of fast on some stuff. Could use a little more instruction for routines. The dvds are fun and a cool way to lose weight.
2,this will not get your heart pumpin',if your looking for a heart pumping cardio get you into gear workout this dvd set isnt for you. but if you have patience to over look the faults of this set you'll find that your hips are slimmer and your abs are tighter.the voice over is creepy and the cuing is off but i have to say i really like the repetition. once a move is introduced you do it numerous times before it is put into sequence. the camera moves around a lot and shows all the dancers doing the move but they all do the move differently. i really wish they'd just focus on rania doing the movements.i really like the bonus waist scupling and ab isolations. OMG they work. i've been doing them every other day and i can feel the difference. like i said before you'll need some patience with this set of dvds not the greatest out there but they get the job of slimming the hips done.
2,"Bad for learning dance, not bad for fitness",I agree with the majority of the reviewers: Rania is NOT a good dancer. But I'm surprised that some reviewers believe it's ok or even good (!) for beginners. This is not true at all! You will pick up bad habits that you will have to unlearn! Some of the backup dancers are actually better than Rania (but none of them are really good).As a workout it's not bad though. It's still more fun than going to gym. Just don't expect it to be very inspiring. The music is not only inappropriate for bellydancing; it's so bland that it doesn't motivate you to move at all.
1,Not for anyone seriously interested in belly dance,"I received these DVDs for my birthday, and was disappointed to find that Rania wasn't all that I expected her to be. She wasn't that bad of a dancer, but the women in the background were horrible. They lacked in technique. When belly dance is about isolating movements to certain areas of the body, these girls were bobbing up and down like jackhammers. If you are looking for a good beginning foundation for Belly Dance, there are many other products that will help much more than these DVDs. If you are only looking for an aerobic workout, then I suggest only buying Cardio Shimmy, because it is the only one that will really make you sweat. Otherwise, the videos move at a slow pace, teach incorrect technique, and you have to perform two in a row to get even the slightest bit of a workout. Save your money and time and buy something else."
3,question,"I would like to know where I should start from. I have bought the 4 DVD-s of Rania: bellydance boogie, pure sweat, cardio shimmy and hip drop hip hop. I am a beginner and in my opinion Rania is passing really quickly from simple moves to very complex, where coordination is very important. For her it might be easy, but for a beginner takes time. These moves should be explained. For example the position of the arms coordinated with steps is difficult at beginning."
3,"Good set, but needs improvement...","I lead a group of women who are learning belly dance through videos, here is some of what we've had to say...Hip-Hop Hip-Drop, Belly Dance Boogie, Pure Sweat:We like that these coordinated the moves into a routine that builds, however she has a tendancy to not warn you that you are switching to something else. Also when the camera angle changes it sometimes gets you off step from the video.Cardio Shimmy:Remember what I said about her not telling you what was coming up? This video is so fast paced that the lack of warning caused us to nearly run into eachother. I suggest watching this one first before you try it."
5,Sedective Smell,"This perfume is amazing! It smells sweet, but sexy and is hard to pull your nose away from the scent! Always get compliments when I wear this perfume. A ""Gotta-Have"" Perfume! The Shipping was VERY fast! It arrived a day before the earliest estimated date. Fast service! Love it!"
3,Wish I had bought the perfume,"It is okay, but does not last long enough. This is especially a problem if you have dry skin. Buy the perfume, don't waste your money on the Eau de Toilette."
3,"Awesome Smell, but very short lived.","I absolutely LOVE the smell of this perfume, but its EXTREMELY short lived. I've tried over-using it,spraying it on clothes, hair, skin but it still doesnt last more than an hour or so. I know others have had this problem and its a shame because its expensive- and its something I can see wearing all the time,but it just doesnt last! Probably wouldnt buy again."
3,Vanilla Fields ring a bell?,So do NOT care for this scent. It smells like vanilla vanilla vanilla. YUCKERS! It's not sexxxy...it's airfreshner and nothing like what I sampled @ Sephora :(
4,Very light and girly,"I love this scent, and the price is right on Amazon. The only thing I wish I could change about this scent is that it disappears really soon after application."
3,inviting but brief,"I was looking for truly pink by Vera Wang when a salesperson in a department store told me that they no longer carried it. the salesperson suggested Vera Wang Princess as a great smelling substitute to Truly Pink. She sprayed it on a fragrance card which i took home and contemplated for a few days. i eventually ordered it on Amazon.The fragrance is delightful inviting and lush.However, it seems to evaporate almost instantly. its rapid vanishing act is so frustrating to me that i now use this perfume as a linen spray. it does remain intoxicating and lush on my sheets for a few nights. so i am returning to truly pink as long as i can find it."
5,Perfume,The product came earlier than expected my gd loves it and she wants another one after she finishes this one.
5,Awesome perfume,"I order a bottle of this once a year from a department store. I love the scent, great for an every day perfume! AND, i got it for half the price!"
5,WOW! What a steal! I regret not buying the 3.4!!! TOTAL BARGAIN!,"First of all, I LOVE this scent and usually buy from Sephora! I decided to see if it was on Amazon and made the mistake of reading reviews after I already purchased it. After reading a couple negative reviews (a couple people said they didn't think it as authentic) I tried to cancel my order, but it was already processing. It was quickly delivered and much to my surprise .. WHAT A BARGAIN I RECEIVED!!! If this is not authentic than boy have they fooled me...b/c its dead on and not faint smelling or watered down at all! I would say its the real deal. My only regret is that I didn't get the bigger bottle! You know how they say ""if something seems too good to be true it probably is???? "" Not at all in this case! I will for sure buy from this seller again! Thanks for the super deal!"
1,wrong thing in the order,"the pic show the color is pink or purple, but which I got is black wrong thing in the order"
2,Ok...,"The item was in the original box, but it was obvious that it had been re sealed. The bottle wasn't secure in the box as it would be if purchased from a store. The perfume wasn't the same color as the original perfume is. It should be a lilac color, instead it was a strange grey color. The smell is similar but does not last as long on the skin or clothing as the original that I had purchased from a department store. I'm not really sure what I purchased but it was definitely not Vera Wang princess. Needless to say I was a little disappointed, this was also my first purchase on amazon. Better luck next time I suppose."
2,Scent for 15 and under,This fragrance is ok for the teen princesses. This scent doesn't linger and is too subtle. Not as nice as vera wang Vanity or Sheer Veil. I don't recommend this unless you are 16 and under. I gave it to my 11 year old and she loves it.
2,Not worth the money.,It smells good but as soon as you spray it on the scent disappears. It has a nice floral smell but not worth the money because you can't even smell it. Very dissapointing.
1,Smells Good!!! But only for 5 minutes!!!,"I am very disappointed in the quality of this perfume!! I had been wanting it for so long, but had to wait to spend $60.00 on a bottle of perfume, to be so let down!! It smells really good but only for a few minutes!!!! Vera Wang must not put any oil in her perfumes! For the cost one would expect it to last for awhile!!! Will not purchase again!!!"
5,Perfume as expected...,"I think I thought this smelt a bit off when I first got it, really alcoholly but then I realized the perfume I had just finished had been around a while and as things age/breakdown the smell changes. Smells as it should now and matched the roller ball perfume I also have. No complaints. I would recommend :)"
1,EXTREMELY disappointed,"I have had 3 other Vera Wang Princess products (the smaller bottle, larger bottle, and roll on). This product appears completely different than the quality of my other Princess products -- see the color, fragrance (this one smells strongly of alcohol for a while), and bottle quality (the ring/crown metal).I would return this product in a heartbeat. Do not purchase it if you have had experience with the original (real, is this product a fake or did Vera Wang butcher her popular scent?)."
1,Muccino an incredible bluf,"Muccino are a director wich no particular ideas, your cinema visions are out of focus that don't communicate nothing at the audience.I'm very hungry because this incredible poor director is an affront for the categories, and i hope that don't have the possibility to direct others movies afther RICORDATI DI ME.Please don't pay to see this orrible movie."
3,very easy to watch,"I thought this movie was entertaining, at times funny and worth watching. It didn't drag out too long and I liked the way it told different stories within the same movie."
5,great film!,"I loved this film. It gave a realistic and entertaining look at relationships. The main characters are all men in different stages of their relationships and dealing with different problems in their relationships. Also, I would not compare it to a ""sex and the city with men"" as the DVD cover does."
4,Funny,"I love Italian movies and like to listen to Italian, so often the movies are sad. I found this very funny and so true to the Italian male character. The characters are handsome and I liked the family relationships."
4,Peter Pan syndrome,"My take on the movie is that it's about men who refuse to grow up. A group of young Italian men is acting out, either through not being fully present in his marriage, not fully committing to his pregnant girlfriend, sleeping around, or not letting go of an ex-girlfriend. As a woman, I found this mildly annoying through much of the movie, but in the end I have to admit I enjoyed the light treatment of the subject. The acting is good, the cinematography beautiful. What's not to like?"
3,A semi-satisfying meal,"This book is the most comprehensive telling of this true story that I could find, and I do feel that I know more now than I did before I read it. It is well-written and went down quickly. However, a couple of things did annoy me: 1) the lack of any type of bibliography or sources and 2), the practice the author had of quoting people's thoughts or words, when there was obviously no way she could have known what exactly was thought or said. I am not an avid reader of true crime, and perhaps those two faults that I found are accepted in the community. I just know it was a bit of a turn off for me."
4,Horrific True Story,"I got this book for my sister, who has a weird fascination with true crime, and serial killers especially cannibals.From the excerpts she read to me, this is a very graphic and sometimes disturbing book. But even more than that, it's the fact that the cannibal found numerous WILLING victims to the ad he placed for someone to murder and then eat.If you've ever wondered if there really are such messed up people in the world, the answer is undoubtedly YES!"
4,shocking,"Wow! I actually never knew there was a society of people out there who not only want to eat other people but be eaten themselves. I've heard of many different fetishes (and can we even call this a fetish?) seems to me it's a death wish. They both seemed like nice and normal, everyday men who were able to pass in society as such and they looked that way too. How shocking this was to all that knew them!The author done a great job on her descriptions of what she believed occured between these two men and being this was her first book I was impressed. I was very shocked at the verdict handed down in this case but not surprised, the law seems to go with ""what society feels is wrong, is right and vice-versa"". Just MY opinion and that's what a review is about."
3,Unalaska and the Conflicts of the Colony,"Although a little dry in places, Orthodox Alaska does a good job of illustrating the conflicts that arose between Russian Orthodox missionaries and the Russian corporations established to mine the wealth of Unalaska. It was especially interesting to see how involved the missionaries were in advocating for the native peoples of the colonies and how the considered such advocacy and important part of their faith."
5,jsmith@shenandoahcountyva.us,"Buddy Moss may not be as common a name in the Piedmont blues as John Hurt or Blind Blake but he sure does delivery,....oh man! He plays his acoustic guitar and sings. I bought both Volumes I & II and am very happy. I've been playing music for many years and have an extensive blues collection, and Buddy Moss's music is great. I can sit and listen with a cold one and my guitar on the couch all night long. I highly recommend Buddy Moss!"
3,Meh,"It is just an extension keyboard. Nothing else. It is good for big guys like men with big hands. It has big buttons, and the keys are not close together like on a regular keyboard. If you have medium to small hands then don't get this product. You will have a hard time reaching over to the functions keys (F1- F4), and maybe the number keys(1-7) too. In general . . . meh.Oh yeah, one more thing. The blue LED is annoying. It hits you right in the eye and you won't be able see your keys in the dark :(Please read this 1st before purchase:(both products are the same, but different color)http://www.amazon.com/review/R1T69EG1Y4OS9S/"
4,GAVE IT TO MY BROTHER,"hE IS LESS A COMP. NERD THAN i SO THIS WAS PERFECT. For those of us willing to go a little further look at the Nostromo52, Great pad!"
