3,Not as funny as I remember.,"The quality of the video is poor. It looks like they video taped it in a movie theater. The movie has some funny scenes but it's not as good as I remember. I probably liked it so much because my girlfriend at the time hated it.Love,Jarrod"
4,Stupid humor,"Ok, after reading a few mixed reviews, I can clear a few things up and hopefully people won't confuse the 2 movies (Stoned age and D&C). Dazed & Confused was more mainstream and The Stoned age was more like a cult classic. Dazed and Confused was a smarter type of humor flick. The Stoned age is a dumb humor flick. Think of it this way. Pissing in someones ice cube tray=Stoned age, pouring paint on the head of a jackass for revenge=Dazed & Confused. Two different types of movies but both are very funny and well made. Both soundtracks are great also. BOC was rocking just as hard and just as good as most of the bands on the D&C soundtrack. Just 2 different styles. I recommend both movies. Or rent em both and compare yourself."
5,Stoned Age DVD,"I love this movie and the DVD is great and has extra features like full-length director audio commentary. The audio and video transfer are EXCELLENT and far above the VHS edition. This DVD won't play correctly on DAEWOO DVD PLAYERS, the picture and audio both screw up after the opening Trimark screen. I also have a Sony DVD player and it plays flawlessly in that one. If you love this little known movie gem then i highly recommend this DVD edition!"
1,Citizen Watch - Terrific buy!,"The watch was lovely. It needed to sit in the sunlight for a few days before it started working but that's what those Eco Drive watches need to do. The deal was terrific, and even though the gift ended up being returned for something different, my experience with the company was very positive - emails were replied to quickly and customer service was very helpful. Definitely would recommend Amazon and the company to anyone looking for a Citizen watch."
3,Hard to like the writer,"I decided to borrow the book first to see if I really wanted it in my rather extensive collection. I'm glad I did. He has quite a bit of information but the way he presents it makes me not want to read more. He comes across as a know-it-all with an attitude. Maybe he's a gardening guru, but after gardening and reading gardening books for around 50 years, even I know I have a lot to learn. I would give him a 3.5 but there is no option for that. Good information, annoying writer. For those who think I'm unfair for taking points off because of the writer, it's my review and I'm not buying it, so live with it. (Said this due to experience reviewing books here.)"
4,Sort of Gardening When it Counts,"Very good book in general. For a book on extreme situation gardening he does spent too much time on sprinker systems. The author gives a very different perspective than most standard gardening book, utilizing alternative nitrogen sources most folks would not even imagine. Overall worth the cost. I am rereading it for the third time now."
4,Gardening When It Counts,This is a good resource for a new gardener desiring to make the most of his/her time gardening. The book helps identify the type of garden you have and how to make the most of it or how to improve it to the garden you want. A quick read and good resource to keep handy
2,"Not bad, but not great","First of all, you need a ton of space if you're going to benefit from this book. If you live in the city or suburbs, consider Ruppenthal's Fresh Food From Small Spaces instead. Second of all, the author is quite condescending, as other reviewers have noted. It may be part of his dry humor, but I can't quite tell. If you can get beyond those two criticisms, then there is plenty of good information tucked into these pages. Does not fully deliver on the promise of this title, I would say, but I enjoyed it and learned from it nonetheless."
3,good for a gardening book,"this is the first gardening book that ive ever purchased.the author gives his opinions on things other than gardening, some of which are fly-brained. He also comes across as boastful.the information in the book seems fairly reliable *i have not tried any of it yet.it seems like a lot of the information in this book is ""filler"" material. such as all of the reasons ""why"" a vegetable grows and all of the gardening chemistry lessons.for a gardening book i think its pretty well done. however, its a gardening book and all the ""filler"" makes it hard to go back into the book and find a straight forward approach or direction."
1,Run. This book is NOT worth your time or money.,"I had very high hopes for this book. My family has started the path to self sufficiency and we were all looking forward to reading the wonderful information touted by some of the reviewers on Amazon. However, the author is condescending and pompous. He seems more interested in showing others how smart he is than writing a meaningful book. He constantly treats the reader like he/she is an idiot, not capable of intelligent, independent thought. Perhaps he has some good information. I don't know. Every time I pick the book up to read, he starts a paragraph with a condescending remark and I put it away. Horrible, horrible book. Run. There are much better books out there. If there were a zero star option, I would have chosen it."
2,Gardening when it counts,Great Service... Book wanders. Seems like the author lost track of what he wanted to talk about. Not actually on the title topic.
2,Boring,"I honestly didn't learn a thing reading this book. Plus, I really NEEDED to learn, so I could start my garden right. I wwas bored 1/4 through, but kept reading, hoping I would find some hidden bit of wisdom. I wasted my time. You can get this info ANYWHERE. Save your money, and buy a book that actually teaches you something."
2,Good Information---Poor Binding,This book is full of good gardening information. However its hard to use it. The binding came apart 3 days after I got the book
4,Nice counterpoint,"This book discusses less intensive gardening, which is relatively unique in modern gardening books. I question some of the author's opinions and assumptions regarding gardening east of the Rockies, especially his claim that it's not worth growing seedlings for transplanting except for the solanums. I found that other claims were also not well supported and there was a certain amount of spottiness to the information. Some information that the author implied would be discussed thoroughly wasn't, at least not in my opinion, but I felt it was a valuable book in spite of these flaws. The discussion of soil science was interesting and the spacing system was useful, although confusingly presented. I particularly liked the discussion of using the hilling technique, another topic not usually discussed in gardening books."
5,practical advice not found in other gardening manuals,"Whoa... talk about turning my whole world of gardening upside-down! This tome has earned a permanent spot on my bookshelf by telling me things that make good common sense I've never read elsewhere. Solomon really laid it out to me about composting. It turns out everything I've thought I should do... like turning my compost frequently and chopping it into tiny bits to get it to decompose faster... burns up much of the nutritional value of the stuff by making it burn too hot. The most earth-shattering for me was discovering that I am not leaving anywhere close to enough space between plants for their roots to develop. Solomon's sketches of the root systems of vegetables alone make this book worth it to get ahold of a copy. I'm just glad I got this before I started planning for next spring. Thanks, Steve!!"
2,Great title but not much else,"I had high expectations when I purchased this book, but soon became disappointed. After reading the entire book I felt like I had wasted much time working my way through the heavy material with very little gain.Also there was erroneous information presented which makes me suspect anything else from this book. It highlights growing in drought situations and at the same time recommends adding lime to reduce soil acidity. However, regions with little rainfall generally have problems with too much alkalinity which adding lime will only make worse.There are some bits of useful tidbits like suggesting to give plants more room and growing in mounds for low rainfall areas. But overall, I do not find this book very helpful and would not recommend this book."
4,gardening,"This was interesting and I learned several things. However, I think it contained more information than I wanted to process."
5,Easy to use for both beginners and advanced gardeners,This book is easy to read and comprhensive. It even tells a person how to start a garden in the spring. Great for first timers who didn't know to get the garden prepared the Autumn before. It also provides lists on which veggies are easy to grow and hearty and which require more care and are delicate.
3,Good if you live in a similar climate,"This book was interesting for me but not really useful. The author, Steve Solomon was very up front in saying that his methods do not apply to desert areas which is where I live. Unfortunately this was not mentioned until I was deep in the book. Having said that, there are a lot of useful concepts worth exploring in the book. If you live in a similar climate or are new to gardening this book will give you a lift over the bumps and is helpful. If you live in the desert it is not truly helpful. I would suggest something in the xeric line."
4,very informative,"Packed with practical information. Geared towards the serious food grower which means people with at least 1/2 acre of usable land. Nontheless, good advice for us hobby food growers, too."
2,Not as I expected...,"Judging by the title I expected this book to be about growing food in the worse-case scenario;, such as societal breakdown, natural disasters, economic collapse etc... As a full-time survival/preparedness instructor, I hoped this book would help me to develop my own skills and then share vital info to those wanting to prepare for hard times. Instead I found a lot of technical jargon and topics more attractive to the avid gardener rather than the self-reliant survivalist. It's not a bad book by any stretch, but not geared towards the prepper crowd. Thanks, Jerry"
2,Dry,"This book is undoubtably full of good information, but it is torturous to read. The authors condecending attitude doesn't help. Maybe this book would work for a hard core gardener, but it's not research for ""preppers"". Some of the information I have found useful, but the delivery is terrible."
2,Yawn,"Sorry dude, I don't have a gazillion acres of land. I live in a trailer park. I like your ideas, but it is just impractical for me."
5,"Inspirational, Funky and Soulful Music","I've had this album for about 6 years now and still listen to it frequently. I love every track on the album-there is no filler on it at all. There is also something for everyone on the album. Whether it be pop, R&B;, dance, gospel or soulful ballads, Ann Nesby delivers on her first solo effort post Sounds of Blackness.The polished production of Jimmy Jam & Terry Lewis keeps her sound consistent. The music and overall sound is uplifting and inspirational. Her track ""This Weekend"" is reminiscent of early Al Green while ""In The Spirit"" is very much like Sounds of Blackness. I listen to ""Lord, How I Need You"" when I'm need of inspiration and affirmation. I highly recommend this album."
4,Reviewing the remixed versions of Ann Nesby,"After listeneing to Nesby's I'm Here for You, several tracks fall within their own standing, such as I'm Still Wearing Your Name, Hold On, and Can I Get a Witness. After searching extensively for several months for any remixed version of any of these tracks, I located Mousse T's remixes of Can I Get a Witness and Hold On. It goes without saying that a true lover of music will greatly appreciate the thin bass lines and high vocals so beautifully placed on these remixed versions. Nesby's articulation and Mousse's T's remixing are too compatible for words. I believe it would be very difficult to obtain a copy of this maxi-single currently, but any price is worth this house-dance masterpiece"
1,"Please look at the title, then the picture.",This movie is mis-titled. Or the title is mis-movied. Take your pick. Tom.
5,Two of A Kind by Porter and Dolly,I was so glad to find this extremely good copy of a great duo (Porter and Dolly) Thanks for finding it for me.
4,Pretty good read,"I found that I was able to start immediately applying the lessons in this book. Most of the ""Power Phrases"" make a lot of sense, and I can really see the benefit of implementing them. Great for the workplace (i.e. Managers, supervisors, ect). That's why I got the book; to find better ways to communicate with my brother, whom I supervise on the job.Two things about the book bothered me, though.1) The context/information in the book was somewhat scattered. When reading it, at times I felt like she just jotted down notes as she thought of them, or perhaps that someone recorded one of her seminars, and she had it printed into a book.2) I found terms like 'Negative Respect-Robbing Poison Phrases' or 'Vicious venom poison phrases that overpower and maim' to be, at times, too much to handle. I almost put the book down permanently because of those idiotic phrases. Luckily, she only used them in a couple of chapters.Hope this helps"
3,Good read,i bought this book for my incarcarated friend he wanted some books to read i was glad i could find a reasonable price for them. It was shipped directly to him without a problem.
1,Maybe too much publicity and a colorfull cover.,"Well, if you are a Neanderthal guy with no experience at all on comunnication with people on your own species, buy this book RIGHT NOW. On other hand, if you are even a little polite and educated this book will not tell you anything new. Anyway, if you are looking to increase your comunicattion skills, you could use one or two pages of the whole book. I think that it is too litle for 200 more pages.It is up to you."
1,Nothing much,I did not learn anything from this book. This was filled with new acronyms for marketing purposes. Pass on this one.Thanks
1,Misleading Title,"[...]It contains very little material on it's nominal subject; almost all of the content is of the form ""So-and-so theorized such-and-such, but This-other-fellow contradicted him, saying this-and-the-other.""Actual facts, raw data, etc. are very sparse.If a history of the academic squabbles in the fields of archeology and historic anthropology is what you're after, by all means, get this book; I'm sure you'll be delighted. If you're actually interested in the evolution of early civilization, look elsewhere."
2,not sure about it,"well i guess this review if based on the printer and the ink . they are great as far as color is concerned .but they run out pretty fast and they are very expensive. we use them for business. we print mostly black and white and rarely use color. but the color somehow runs out as if it mixes in with the black . we were not able to use the printer after the magenta ran out , when we put the magenta in it informed us that all the other colors ( not the black, since we replaced it a week before ) were out and we could not use the printer till we replaced them all .. somehow i think its a scam with hp , but im not an expert on manufacturing .."
1,Overpriced for what you get.,"This item is frequently advertised as an 18-in-1 tool. However, I would really classify it as about 8-in-1. They (Paladin) mislead you by listing each wire size it can strip as a different tool even though they are the same tool bit. Essentially you have PLIERS, WIRE CUTTERS, KNIFE, PHILLIPS, SLOTTED, PUNCH DOWN, WIRE STRIPPER, and FILE. It is decent quality, but I don't really see the point in Paladin contracting with SOG for the pliers that have 'double the gripping power' if the open edge of the handles kill your hand when squeezing them. I'm not soft-handed, but trying crimp with the pliers can get quite painful.The punch down tool is handy to have, but if I could go back and change my mind, I would rather carry a different tool that offers more than this one whether it be a true SOG, Leatherman, or Swiss."
2,Paladin tools,"I like the tool, But I especially wanted for the wire stripersPowerPlay 6500 PT-510 Compact Multi-Tool for DataComm, Telecom and Electricalthey do not work as well as I intended. Very generic for a well built tool."
2,Compilation of a Compilation,"This is actually two obscure compilation albums pasted back-to-back. A decent collection of songs by each group, but it's all stuff that's been released before. Not to be confused with the Styx / REO live recording which was released around the same time."
1,nothing what I expected,"I bought this for my grandson who really wanted to learn to take pictures. But he wanted to be able to see them or get them made into photos. This does not have an SD card. You have to load the pictures to your computer, burn a disc and then get the photos made from that. Too complicated for an 8 year old."
1,Not what was pictured,"whats shown on the preview is a small square camera silver cameraShift3 Multi-function 3-in-1 Usb Mini Digital Camera with Keyring (VARIOUS COLORS), what i got was this oval shaped green thing that wont sit flat on a table picture at [...] completly disipointed in this seller, the name says it all: cheep"
1,Photos erase when battery dies,"I bought this camera to keep in my backpack for whenever I need a photo. Unfortunately, I found out that it has no lasting memory AND it drains batteries very quickly even when not in use. When the battery dies, all my photos disappear. I regret this purchase."
1,Good album...but bad re-mastering,"I agree with John (from N.Y.), these 24-bit re-masters of the Abba catalogue were a big letdown. In a side by side comparison, the original discs sounded much better than these. The originals were brighter and plenty full; just like the original album sounded.On the other hand, these 24-bit discs sound slightly muddy and the high end (which includes acoustic guitars and cymbals) are flat or dead sounding thanks to the no-noise solution. My advice, is to save your money and keep your old discs."
3,Not Abba's best,"I am a big fan of Abba, and have all their recordings. I think that this album is one of their weaker efforts. There are only really two stellar tracks which match up to Abba's finest, ""Take a Chance,"" and ""Name of the Game."" ""Eagle"" was never one of my favorites, and the minor songs are all well sung and produced, but just don't hit on all cylinders. I really like ""I'm a Marionette,"" but find that the instrumental bridge after the first chorus takes some ooomph out of the song. The spoken entry to ""Move on"" is a little silly, etc.I think of this album as being the last of their early period. ""Voulez-vous,"" ""Supertrouper"" and the stunning ""Visitors"" are the complete albums of a better and more mature group, and leave their early albums, hits aside, in the dust."
2,crap,"The (evil) mark of disco is scorched into this album and this group. Numerable people of sane mental health enjoy they're records and numerable talented musicians list them as a strong influence. I can't really understand why. I'm not going to try to make this review an objective one. I really can't stand the music. It's annoying and has an ability to burrow itself into your brain, refusing to leave. I've tried to like them, god knows I've tried. Do I have bad taste, or is it just the rest of the world?"
5,a pearler,"This is mid-career ABBA, at the peak of their powers. Although they obviously were still not confident enough to stretch themselves fully (we're talking about a marketing phenomenon here! they didn't want to prejudice their chances!) they still created the magical Name of the Game, a portent of their later, more melancholy work. The ""mini-musical"" is still pretty much an embarrasment, mainly due to the whole naff concept. Poor music fan from Norway just doesn't get it. That's ok, ABBA have enough fans already."
4,Brings back old memories,Abba is one of the groups I grew up listening to because of my uncle. I love all the songs on this album except for the Doris Day version Thank you for the music. Otherwise this is a great album.
1,How to advertise an out of stock product!,Learn it from Amazon!! It sends me an e-mail with a featured product that is not available in its warehouse. Looks like their systems aren't talking to each other anymore.
1,Tired of this,"Amazon pulled this type of switch on me before. I was able to add the advertised item to my cart then searched for more items to qualify for free shipping. When I checked out, they removed the sale item from the cart saying it was no longer available. NICE TRICK - THE OLD BAIT AND SWITCH. Very disappointing. I even tried emailing customer service to complain and was rudely dismissed through email."
2,No Secret here.,"This book says the same thing all other motivational self help books on the market say. Others have done a better job. Consider Brian Tracy, John Maxwell, or Jim ROhn.The link to success to being a modern samurai is a huge stretch.I give it two stars because of the heart warming story of the authors father being a holocaust survivor, his amazing story is the best part of the book. But its his fahters story, the authors story is nothing new."
3,works fine if you don't move much,"Expected this item to allow me to listen to music, etc. while moving about. Found that due to the infrared line-of-sight requirement, I couldn't move a couple of feet or sometimes tilt my head too much without hearing annoying static.The rechargeable AAA batteries and ability for the transmitter to serve as a recharger is a nice touch though. Sound quality is also decent, and headphones are a fairly comfortable fit. Overall, these headphones are an okay buy if you want to not annoy your significant other / roommates while watching TV, listening to music on desktop computer, or otherwise do some listening where you don't need to move much.Personally, I found that I prefer to blare sound instead of being considerate of my roommates, so will sell mine for cheap!"
2,Pointless,"I purchased a set of these new and was unable to get them to work further than 6 inches from the transmitter. This negates any value the wireless feature may have. Fortunately, the vendor refunded the purchase price.I eventually got around the problem by attaching a 25 foot extension cord to a set of ordinary headphones.On the plus side, the headband is extremely comfortable. I recommend this model to anyone who enjoys wearing headphones but isn't concerned whether they work or not."
3,Great While They Last,"I don't think these are still manufactured, possibly because the transmitters seem to burn out after a period of time. We're currently on our third or fourth (I forget which) transmitter, which we were able to buy on eBay for a very low price. I normally don't buy products that quit so soon, but we love the sound quality for viewing TV programs.I just set up the last backup transmitter I had, when the previous one stopped working. I haven't been able to find any more. I wouldn't buy one used because of the short life. When (or before) this one dies, I suppose we'll have to look for an alternative.If you can find a new one for the right price, enjoy it until it stops working."
5,Best book to read to understand Russia today.,"I've lived in Russia for the last eight yearsand have read many histories of Russia and theSoviet Union, but ""Russia Under the Old Regime""best explains why Russia is where it is today and where it is going."
3,Stan Laurel's personal dedication to his daughter:,"There's a reason for the ending where Stan attacks Ollie.Apparently Stan's daughter Lois had not been fond of Oliver(affectionatly known to her as""uncle Babe"")on account of past films she had seen where he bullied her father and made him cry.The final scene in this film was to prove to his Lois that her daddy is perfectly capable of standing up for himself when need be."
4,"Incomplete, but concise and correct","I read this book, here in Brazil.I'm an agronomist and I like to read books.This book is concise and has many B&W; photos.This book is also correct.The author seems to be from England, but even so, all failures from the sub-machinegun Sten, are described in this book.This book is unbiased.The biggest failure of this book is that, it hasn't anything about hand-grenades,rifle-grenades, bazookas and panzerfaust.This book is about pistols, revolvers, rifle, sub-machineguns and machineguns used in World War II.This book is incomplete, but concise and correct."
4,Sumi-E instruction book,My Sumi-E instructor advised purchasing this book. She was surprised that I found one because it's out of print. It looks like a helpful guide as I continue to practice the Sumi-e style.Purchased it on Amazon. I often have success locating items using Amazon.
5,The inside look of depression,"How someone who ""has it all"" comes crashing down and faces depresion head on. It was great to hear the true story of agony and pain suffered by someone dealing with depression. It is such openness and honesty that will someday break down the stereotypes associated with mental illness. Truly a great book. Thanks"
5,I Liked This Book,"This book delivers what it promises. I would especially recommend it to teachers.Quantum physics does not satisfy our physical intuition, so popularizations often sacrifice rigor.This book impressed me with the way it eases us into an acceptance of some potentially frustrating ideas. Those ""quantum ideas"" are presented both plausibly and with some rigor.I am a more educated man for having read this book.(A footnote: I was especially pleased to see mathematics described as a language. It is, indeed, a formal language.)"
3,Shadow Redwork,Instructions are clear and well written. Some of the patterns are difficult to read the shadow words because of the letters being hidden behind the flowers.I disagree with Alex's instructions to embroider the flowers first then trace the letters and embroider them. This requires going over the design twice.Projects are great and general instructions very good for completing them. The patterns may be adapted to any of the projects in the book.A basic knowledge of embroidery is helpful.
1,Muddled and untrue,"This is a terrible book with much false information. In particular the section on Michael Kruvant is pure mythology. Kruvant perpetrated an enormous hoax and suckered Harris right in. Kruvant was a schizophrenic man who made up a totally false life, claiming to have multiple university degrees while in reality he was a college drop out, and was treated in several mental hospitals. He lived in a fantasy world but was very charming and quite intelligent and could be quite persuasive. I knew him personally and have followed the fantastic controversies he stirred up with much amusement. I'm sure in his saner moments, he also must have been quite amused at the fuss he had stirred up. If the other sections of the book are as badly researched as the Kruvant story, then this book should be move into the fiction category."
2,"Take My Theory, Please!","Despite the credentials of the author and the individuals interviewed, and the apparent sincerity of all those involved, the whole thing smacks of conversion fever; intelligent, educated and experienced people somehow warped by their brush with the beyond, or their taste for it. We don't get any semblance of facts, data or science to make this book worth buying except to encourage and embolden the flock. A mish-mash of truncated interviews stirred into a stew pot boiling with biblical mysticism, new age pop, psychological paranoia, mass conspiracy theory, mentalism....am I leaving anything out folks? When we finally get to the ignobly defrocked Uri Geller it was time to ring the bell, close the book, and quench the candle.At $24 for a mere 224 paperback pages it may not play in Peoria, but I'm sure they'll move a few copies in Roswell. Cool looking cover though!"
2,Connecting the dots fails to connect,"This is the most disconnected rambling thing I've read in a long time. A series of interviews with a lot of people, many of whom I've never heard of, in question and answer format, it was a real battle to get to the last page. Ms. Harris tries (in vane) to connect subjects that have nothing in common from UFO's to remote viewing to ESP."
5,Putting together pieces of a puzzle,"Paola Harris is a nice Italian/American lady in the UFO business. You can read about UFO stars and a new world view. Great book! Recommended! Connecting the Dots, New Revised Version, is from 2008. Her 2009 book, All the Above, is interesting. Another good book from 2009 is Messages by Stan Romanek."
2,Not impressed,"Having read so many good reviews about this book I was curious to buy and read it only discover that the whole book is actually a mix of various interviews that are more or less knnown to almost every UFO researcher or reader. Again we are in front of a book that lacks EVIDENCE of what it actually presents. Unfortunately this is the fundamental problem with UFOlogy. If we can trust in good faith one single person's testimony without any proof then we only need Phil Corso's - to mention one - interviews or statements (and his famous Roswell book) as the final verdict that UFOs exist and are here, but do you really think that this is enough ?? Not for me, however...."
2,Not for West Coast,"Altho this book has lovely photographcs, I never got into the text due to the fact that it focuses entirely on NorthEast Coast gardening and is of no use to coastal gardeners any where else. I should have paid attention to the pub synopsis. The pics are entirely of East Coast gardens and do not relate AT ALL to the more rustic coastal areas of the West. Just a warning that this book is only for those wanting to use it to garden in the East Coast area...I didn't know & incurred the cost to send the book back.Hence, only two stars."
2,didn't care for it,"Great cover. But the author rambles on about herself and her family. Not interested. Was looking for tips on Seaside Gardening. Frankly never finished the book. Maybe it got better, but in the middle of the second chapter I lost interest."
5,"Move Over Hootie, these guys are for real","after listening to these guys for over four years, i ve come to the conclusion that they are the premier band in folk fused roots rock. the chords catch you by the neck and never let go, along with the rootsy voice of palladino, this band is on its way up."
4,Very good music with good vibes,I had this when it came out on tape. Most of the songs have a really good sound. I really like the first 2 song(the reason I bought the cd)
3,Some assembly required!!!,"This tv stand is great. It has 2 shelves that are plenty wide- enough to fit a dvd and video player on the same shelf. It is designed to work with a 32"" FD/Trinitron WEGA by Sony, but can be used with just about anything. There's only one problem- SOME ASSEMBLY REQUIRED. It's just a hastle to put it together, that's all. It would be much simpler if it would just come pre-assembled. Otherwise, this is a 5 star item. I recommend it to anyone!!!"
3,Incomplete,"Though this album contains too many ballads and too many lesser-known tracks, it is still Alabama, and you know and I know that Alabama can never be surpassed and they are the BEST country group in the world. ""Can't Keep a Good Man Down"" is the ultimate confidence song, ""Fire in the Night"" is the ultimate '80s song, and ""The Closer You Get"" is one of their best. Like I said, not too complete, but if you're gonna love Alabama, you gotta have this CD in hand!"
1,doesn't fit,"These outlet covers do not fit traditional outlets. Notice that there are 2 screw holes--one on top and one on bottom. They did not line up with the standard outlet screw holes. Better to go with a brand that has one screw hole in the middle, as is typical of most outlet covers."
5,THE FUNK BROTHERS pt II,"I love ths cd, nevr knw tht the Bar Kays were so ""DOWN RIGHT FUNKY"".....HOLY GHOST is the jam!!!!"
1,Bad warranty service (useless warranty),"I have this coffeemaker less than three months. It makes good coffee.... I noticed that the glass carafe is crazed on the bottom (short cracks that don't go all of the way through). It still holds water.I called the company, and was told that glass parts aren't covered by the warranty. It is obviously a manufacturer's defect. I won't buy anything from Toastmaster, or from any of their related companies. Obviously, they don't care about the consumer, and they don't stand behind their product."
2,toastmaster tcm4w,"Works pretty well and brews well, but is hard to take apart for cleaning. The shape of the coffee filter basket makes putting the paper cone in pretty difficult. In general; the construction is pretty cheep and I expect some part to fail every time I use it."
3,No automatic shutoff,"I was unsure by the product description if this 4-cup coffee maker included an automatic shut-off feature. Something in the notes led me to believe it had one, but once I received the product and reviewed the manual, I found that it does not. I returned it, so I can't comment on any of the other features."
2,"Pretty cheap parts, hard to manuever, but the coffee is good","This is pretty cheaply made but it DID work. The carafe broke (my fault) after a few weeks and I couldn't find a 4-cup replacement carafe, white, anywhere so I had to throw the coffeemaker away. Just bought a 4-cup Mr. Cofffee at Target and it works SO much better, for the same price. Suggest you pass on this brand and go to Target instead."
3,Save your money,"Does make ok coffee.... unfortunately you will probably never get your cup full. The first few times i used this coffee maker, I wondered why I wasn't getting a full mug. It was because much of the coffee was ending up on my counter.I was a little nervous about this coffee maker because it was a just a little different than the Mr. Coffee I was using before. The round shape of the carafe was a little different than the more squared off shape that I was used to. When I actually tried to use it, I realized that the pour spout on the round carafe is not pronounced enough to keep whatever's inside from dribbling down the front of the pot.This is not a very substantial or well made coffee maker, but it gets the job done. Pouring takes a little practice."
5,Coffee Drinker,Tried to find a white 4-cup coffee maker - not easy - liked the Melita but only comes in black - the Toastmaster was well recommended by other Amazon customers so I went with it and it has been perfectly fine. One must press the back cylinder while exerting forward pressure on the filter holder to swing the filter holder out - but once you get it - no problem. I am satisfied.
3,It's a great tool - and the seller offers awesome service!,"I purchased a couple of these and there is a little variety in terms of how thick or thin the press makes your tortillas. My first press was few times found that despite it being extremely firm, a wonderful quality, it was also somewhat concave. I contacted the seller and commented on this feature; he sent a replacement and I have to say that the new device is fan-freakin'-tastic! I need to watch how often I make tortillas now for fear of getting fat. YUM! This is the bomb."
3,It works okay,"I actually have two of these and have not had the paint chip problem. I wouldn't say this is a top of the line tortilla press by any stretch of the imagination, but it's not bad. It gets the job done. The handle is indeed wobbly and no amount of adjustment on the screw seems to help. But, if you're just beginning your tortilla making career it is a good starter."
3,So-So,"Bought this ""chap-stick"" based on reviews. It's okay - nothing special. It sort of sits on the lips rather than feeling like it is absorbing. Thus, it wears off pretty quickly. Doesn't appear to be natural ingredients. Perfectly fine, but not the best I've ever used."
3,A little disappointed.,This book I was a little disappointed in. It's pretty much a mirror of the Maya 5 Rendering book. It even has the same color showcase of images. The only true addition to the book is the Maya Basics Rendering tutorial video thats located on the DVD (worth $34.99). If you previously purchased the Maya Basics Rendering DVD you pretty much have a revised Maya 5 Rendering book. The only reason I am giving it a three is because there is really nothing new.
4,Good Book,"That is good book for beginners. But I cann'd dowloading support_files from Autodesk site. Could you help me, when I can downloading this files. Excuse me for my english."
1,Poorly Written - not a good teacher,"This book is the most dissapointing of a good series.The author gives little or no explanation of rendering concepts or even simple explanation of what is going on through the examples. This makes completing tutorials difficult, and when you do battle through them, the concepts of rendering in Maya are still a mystery!Please someone give us a book that teaches well."
2,JENSON ONLINE INC.,I would not order from this company again. I didn't mind the writting through out the book so much but there was food on the cover and also inside. They said it was in good condition and I feel it was not. This book was the most expensive f 7 that I ordered and in the worse condition. I will say it came very fast tho it was the first to come. Jan
5,Love these tumblers,This purchase was to replace a Thermos tumbler that I lost in September. A friend teases me that I don't go anywhere without my water cup. She is correct. These keep ice all day. All I do is refill the water and I have great ice water all day. I can only imagine how good they would be with hot beverages.
5,An excellent pack for deployment or civilian use,"I'm very happy with this pack. CamelBak's build quality is top-notch and is up to the demands of a military deployment, outdoor adventure, or just sprinting along on a sport bike (which is what I primarily use mine for). It's comfortable and will stow loads of gear securely. I've dressed mine up with several MOLLE pouches, such as the Voodoo Tactical MOLLE Utility Pouch for use on Tactical Vest andTactical Molle Pocket Pouch Army Digital Camouflage, which give me more options to organize my gear and can be easily added or removed depending on my needs. You'll spend as much or more going my route as you would buying the more expensiveCamelbak BFM - 100 oz/3.0L Foliage Green NSN 8465015174778, but you'll have the option of tailoring the pack to suit your needs on any given adventure. This is an excellent bag. You won't be disappointed."
4,It is true with the sizes.,"I think these shoes are pretty great for a hardy walking/ outdoor shoe and it is true,,,I went with a whole size smaller,,,6.5 instead of 7.5 and kept my fingers crossed and it worked for me. Can't go wrong with the price either."
4,Not an average album by Aztek Trip,"I was lucky enough to buy their cd and I have become a fan of their music. The songs are well written rock tunes with a couple sounding like Green Day(which is a complement). Some songs are much slower, others more intense so you get just about everything you could want in a rock album. ""Average Day"", ""Mesmerized"" and ""Slipped Away"" alone would make this a album worth having."
4,Love these books,I have bought these books for my grandchildren and nephews. They are so cute. I particularly love all of the pictures and the maps of the places they are reading about.
5,Cute and comfy!,My 11-month-old son and I both LOVE these shoes. He gets a huge kick out of them and they are really soft and comfy. The soles are very flexible and the velcro makes them very easy to put on. I don't feel guilty making him wear them like I have some other stiff sneakers. The company was great to deal with and everywhere we go people smile when my son toddles by :)
5,So much FUN !!!!,My 15 month old got a pair of these for Xmas from his aunt. These were the best gift ever for him! We put them on right away and the look on his face when he realized HE was the one making the noise. . was absolutely priceless!Not to mention the fact that I know exactly where he is in the house even if I can't see him.I intend on purchasing a few more pair like these so that he'll have some others he can wearwith other outfits.
4,Good for info,This is a great little reference tool for building a pond. It does lack detail in construction or things like filtration and upkeep.The outdoor plant and fish sections were informitive. It gives a lot more detail there but it's getting there certain chapters were a little vague. It's a good book for basic know-how and we be good to add to a group of books on the topic. However not stand alone one stop resource.
5,Gripping read,"Not only does this book chronicle the life of Ohio State University's former basketball coach (and Hall of Fame Coach) Fred Taylor, it delves into the behind-the-scenes stories of corruption in college basketball and its impact on the sport.There are numerous interviews with players and coaches and other sports figures that shed light on the exceptional man who was Fred Taylor.It is touching, moving, infuriating, and gives the reader insight that has never before been put out for public consumption.The book was published about a month prior to his death."
3,Nicccccee,I dont know how many people play basketball. Maybe a lot of the one who purchase these dvds cant even do a simple hesitation between the legs followed by a heads up. If you have handles and can play the game this one is a keeper. Although they could have added some of the other players who display the killa crossover..like my man killa kobe. But they do have A.I. and everbody in the league knows about his crossover. This dvds has a variety of nice moves along with some stuff that they could have edited out..for those of you that have seen this dvd then you know what i mean..So the next time you make a movie called ankile breakers..please only show moves that are breaking people ankles..I have seen plently of Iverson moves that has made some other NBA players fall..and dont forget about Stevie ....and the others who also have displayed some nice crossover as well...
2,So-so NBA DVD,"NBA entertainment should have come up with ""Spectacular Plays"" compilation rather than ""Ankle Breakers"". Nothing exciting to see here. Buy NBA ""Dunks"" instead."
5,Big Trouble for the industry,This is another hot DSGB cd. The beats are sick just like P Troy's... and his flow is straight. A must have for every P Troy fan or GA fan period. Must cop. Holla when it's gangsta. Peace.
1,Awkward,"I purchased these hoping that they would alleviate the discomfort I feel with the thinner bra straps that are so common, even on larger cup sized bras. These cushions do provide relief but they look awkward under clothing. When the bra strap is in place, the cushion sticks up on both sides, showing up under clothing. I look like I'm wearing shoulder pads. Also the plastic sleeves on either side of the cushion are weird. I'm not sure what purpose they serve. I don't recommend these cushions unless you have a very wide strap that you will use them with. Anything else is just awkward. I'm going to try something else that will hopefully work better."
3,Photography,Got book quickly quality was not the best but the book did the job. Barely used it in class but it will be helpful in the future.
1,Not in new condition,"The handlebars received were clearly shelf display or otherwise marred-- chrome was scratched and scuffed in places and labels worn off. Workable, but not satisfactory, and clearly not what one would buy as ""new"" in person."
1,Rusted within 6 Months Stored in Dry Garage,"Yes, they have rust on them in many different places after less than 6 months, and my bike is stored in a perfectly dry garage.I only used the bike twice since installing the handlebars. I do like the shape of them. I got them to transform my hunched-over mountain bike position to an upright position. This shaped worked well, but you will have to purchase new cables to create more length since the upright position requires a longer distance from where they were.I was excited about these, but when I saw the rust today, I decided to warn everyone.**UPDATE**After letting the merchant know about the rust, Niagara Cycle's outstanding customer service shipped me another one. Since it is Fall, I will let it sit untouched for the Winter in my garage to see if the rust appears on this one, then I'll install on the bike when the weather breaks. So I give five stars (*****) to Niagara, but the jury is out on the product itself."
4,Slappy is Back!,"If you wonder where Night of the Living Dummy is, well it was never adapted into an episode, probably because of Slappy not being in it.In Night of the Living Dummy II, Amy Kramer's ventriloquist dummy's head keeps popping off and her Dad brings her a new dummy from a second-hand store. The dummy is called Slappy! Suddenly, a series of accidents occur and Amy's parents blame her, when actually Slappy is responsible.In Bride of the Living Dead, Jimmy O' James and his ventriloquist dummy named Slappy, is playing gigs here and there to make money. One night Slappy falls in love with a doll that belongs to a young girl named Mary-Ellen. Slappy literally sends himself in the mail to the girl's house so he can be with the doll.I'm a big Slappy fan. The episodes are fun, but they don't do the books justice, thanks to the short running time.If you like this DVD, you should try Goosebumps -Goosebumps - Night of the Living Dummy III."
4,Different,"The book is not ""a typical historical romance novel"". The book starts with a stary eyed, naive heroine and as she learns about people (that is the best part of the book) in a brothel, the plot and characters gain substance. I recommend it to readers who expect more that the innocent girl meets the dashing hero type of romance."
1,RIP OFF,"The carnival tycoon one way nice TIP:don't use cheat codes on it, the game goes balistic and shut down!! OTHER GAMES sucked!!!! rip off something i will never get ever again in my life!!!!!!!!!!!!"
2,gloves,"There are way to big!! Even after washing them, plus they feel like sandpaper... wouldn't recommended buying even for the price :("
4,Good enough for what I paid,"Good product, keeps hands warm..but think again about your finger tips..i decided to buy these thinking I can withstand the temperature even if my finger tips are not covered..I was terribly wrong..although it keeps my palm warm, i need to get something that would cover my finger tips"
3,Finger-less gloves/Liners,"Two main reasons to purchase these gloves, they are made in the usa, and they are relatively worth the money (someone of the cheapest fingerless gloves on amazon).A little big on women, but perfect for men, I got a pair for a friend and I. Will update the review once i wash and wear them..."
4,good gloves,"Hey, these are fingerless gloves...not much more to say really. Inexpensive, warm and Inexpensive. They also seem to be holding up pretty well."
5,Great fingerless gloves,I bought these for my husbnad. He needed them for typing. His office is really cold. He loves them and they wash great!
1,Got what I paid for...:/,"Well I def got what I paid for, got two right hand gloves, one of them is bigger then the other and the material feels horrible, way rough. Just being 100% honest."
3,nothing fancy,"They do the job of keeping my hands warm but leaving my fingers out to work. A bit of an odor to them, but it's wearing off as I wear them."
4,Good for different uses.,I like these gloves for multiple reasons. They let me keep my hands relatively warm without any loss of dexterity when it is cold out. This is good for photography and hunting. I also sometimes wear them under another pair of larger gloves for added warmth when it is brutally cold outside.
1,"Oh wow, these suck.","Itchy, scratchy, uncomfortable like an ancient wool sweater -- the kind that makes your neck bleed where it touches your skin. They're also huge.On the bright side, definitely warm. Woohoo.Get something else."
4,One size fits all - they are to big for me !!!!!,I needed them for typing on my new computer. Big screen and big keyboard but the typing gloves mess uo the the keyboard and the cover. they do not fit me - they are too big and drag. I still have them but I doing more exercise maybe hands will bigger (10 minutes a day for exercising ever other day) some day they will fit.
3,Definitely for big hands,"My hands are medium-large. The gloves were a little too big for me. Don't even bother if your hands are super large. Also the gloves are ""ambidextrous"". In that one glove fits either hand. This feels rather weird for me. Personally I would have preferred the $0.99 fingerless gloves from the dollar store just because of this."
3,fingerless gloves,"I like these...they allow me to grab things and function normally while keeping my hands warm...and they weren't expensive...however, look at the photo carefully: there's some kind of writing on them that's like paint or something and instead of turning the gloves so the writing shows in the same place when you're wearing them, it shows up on the bottom of one and the top of another...and I have no idea what the writing designates; it's useless and will apparently wear off eventually....sooooo...in my opinion these take a hit on quality...but, like I said, they weren't real expensive."
2,The wool is itchy,"It's unfortunate that the wool used is itchy. Otherwise, it would have been a great pair of gloves."
3,serviceable...,"---------- except for not having palm friction (rubber dots... ), they're just what i expected . . ."
4,Pretty good,Using them for fishing and driving the boat on cold days. They work pretty well. They had some stray strands and needed cut off so dont know how long they will last.
1,toilet tank flapper,This nice flapper does not fit in my toilet because it is too small and cannot work to flush.
4,Snow Mountain Passage,Excellent book centered around the recollections of one of the Donner Party. Author did a terrific job of integrating the actual events with the very lucid memoirs of one of the Reed daughters.
2,This is NOT about the Donner Party,"I will echo the other reviews posted here that were disapointed that the author did not spend more time on the actual Donner Party. This book follows the adventures of James Reed, who was exiled from the wagon train about a month before they ended up stranded at Donner Lake. Reed made it across the Sierra Nevada Range and into California and spends the rest of the book roaming the state trying to round up a rescue party.In the meantime, back at the Donner Party there is incredible human drama and tragedy. But this author chose to remain with the less interesting aspect of the story. I was very disapointed but recognize that the book is written with great skill and it was a fast read. So if you are interested in what James Reed was doing while the Donner Party members were resorting to cannibalism, this book is for you!"
4,"Fascinating, but...","The Donner Party survival story is a powerful icon of westward expansion and California history. Houston's novel is fascinating, but somehow steers away from facing clearly those families marooned in the snow. I read two books on the Donner party. A 1936 history by George R. Stewart, Ordeal by Hunger, is still in print available in paperback at Amazon. Somehow, the straightforward historical story is more vivid than Houston's novel. I felt that he kept the pain of the incident at a distance by concentrating on James Reed and viewing the horror though the long-ago memory of Patty Reed. As a history of the early American settling of California, I found it quite interesting."
3,Story of Donner Party Overshadows Story of California,"James D. Houston novel, Snow Mountain Passage, has two main threads. The minor one is the recollections of an eighty year survivor of the Donner Party looking back to her time as an eight year old during the struggle for survival. The major storyline, though, is that of her father, James Frazier Reed, and his search for a rescue party for his lost family and the other emigrants as he gets caught up in the politics and struggles of a new territory being born. The problem with the book is that the more interesting story (and better writing) lie with the Donner Party and the interesting clash of personalities there. Unfortunately, the reader has to go through much less developed or lively personalities, such as Reed himself, to get back to the heart of the story. The tragedy of the Donners hangs over the entire novel but is not enough to carry it through the less interesting or illuminating sections."
4,Great picture quality!,I have been very pleased with this printer. So long as your resolution is set very high on your camera your pictures will be as good as lab quality!The only downside is it does not come with a disk to run this printer with your computer or the cable needed. You have to buy it directly from Cannon. Also I have had a few pictures come out with very faint lines or dots.I would purchase this printer again if I had to make the decision for a second time.
3,connector incompatible with PC USB port,"Print quality is good. But the cables come with printer can only connect to Canon digital cameras (I tried poershot and EOS 10D), it cannot connect to PC UBS ports, though it looks like UBS connector. So, there is no way you can print a picture to cp-x00 from a PC.Anybody there know a way to print from a PC?"
4,A Well-Written Examination of a Persona,"This is the finest book on Waits to date, especially as it focuses on his ""myth"" rather than his ""life"", which would have been a foolish and flawed undertaking from the beginning, especially with such an archetypal American character (as others have shown).My main misgiving is that the book, while essentially well-written, contains a little too much common-knowledge and obvious ""filler"" paragraphs--but it's well worth the purchase, nonetheless, and I enjoyed it and learned much as a result of having read it."
5,Excellent book!,"Jay S. Jacobs has done a remarkable job drawing us closer to the mystique and enigma that is Tom Waits. It's an extraordinary story. Expertly researched and immmaculately detailed, ""The Wild Years"" is just that, an absolutely riveting and engaging look at one of music's most provocative and insightful characters. A marvelous and thought provoking read."
2,Disapointing book,This book is nothing but boring. It basically tracks Tom's Wait's life going from CD to tour to CD. It gives little about the man who wrote the songs. Not sure maybe Tom Waits is on CD's and tours. Maybe he is a boring guy with nothing really to write about except that he keeps on sueing people and that he seems to have made quiet a bit doing just that. I like Tom Wait's music but this book is too boring I struggeled getting through it.
4,Good bio of a great musician,"Tom Waits is one of my favorite musicians, and he is as an interesting as some of the characters he is famous for singing about. The author notes in the beginning of this book that many stories about Waits have been fabricated by Waits in various interviews. For instance, nobody knows where Waits was born, and Waits himself has given several different locations. But the stories, true or not, are great, sometimes really funny."
3,He was better when he was sad...,"This is an intriguing collection. Some songs are good, but they're outnumbered by the mediocre ones. The problem is I keep comparing the performances to ""Live at the Fillmore"", and the ones on Crossroads 2 just pale in comparison.I've always felt that Clapton peaked during the Layla sessions (and the Fillmore gigs after that)with the Dominos and Duane Allman. Sure there are jewels within those post-Layla albums, but he never equalled, musically and emotionally, the power of the Layla album.Just like the Stones (IMO)peaked during the ""Exile on Main Street"" sessions. All albums after that were just ""hanging around"" albums. Good for the Beatles that they stopped after Abbey Road."
3,Almost like being there...,"As a ga-ga 16 year old I was there for the recording of three songs on disk 2. It was a double bill of Santana and Clapton at the (then new) Providence Civic Center. Clapton OPENED his set with Layla (sans piano/bird ending). He looked cool as a cucumber; cigarette propped up on the machine head ala Keith Richards, and tore the place down. At that moment I thought I was looking at the coolest human being in the world. Santana eventually joined him for a rollicking encore of Eyesight to the Blind, which Clapton performed in the movie version of Tommy. Santana wailed, Clapton cooked, I dedicated my life to good tunes. Just hearing the soundtrack really does little justice to the whole wacky experience.For me - not just a CD but also a beautiful moment of wasted youth recaptured."
2,"He's fantastic, but this box set isn't","I'm a huge fan of Clapton's work with John Mayall, Cream, and in Derek and the Dominoes, but with the exception of From The Cradle, nearly everything after 461 Ocean Blvd. is a meandering waste of his talent. This box set showcases the years 1974-1978, when EC was often quite out of it, and his performances are lackluster. True, there are moments---c'mon, it's Eric Clapton. But there's an awful lot of dreck here. Get the Cream Box instead."
3,Overrated-vastly.,"There are times when Clapton is truly brilliant, there are other times when he is not. This also sums up this 4 disc set. At times his soloing is inspired, at other times aimless and overstated. Guitarist George Terry also kicks in some rather uninteresting solos throughout. The trouble with the seventies output is that, Carl Radle aside, the band was just not that good. This is quite apparent when one listens to them live. Of the studio efforts of this outfit only 461 Ocean Blvd. is a truly consistently solid effort the rest of them, again like this set, have their moments but often succumb to uninspired flat performances. See 461, Eric Clapton, Derek & The Dominos, Another Ticket, and From the Cradle for his better efforts."
5,Deserves more than 5 stars...,"I'm not gonna waste space on this....All I can say is listen to the Clip of ""Badge"", the greatest version of the greatest song ever!"
4,"14"" King David Pear Cork Conducting Baton",A good basic baton. Good for beginners. The pear shaped cork makes this comfortable to hold.
2,"Ok, but not great.","This is a pretty good product if you don't want to spend the money on a real quality baton. I had to order two because the first one came broken. The second came warped, then I just gave up and super glued it. When in tact, it has a pretty good balance. Though I don't really recommend it."
2,broke within 24 hours. terrible quality,grandson loved it but it didn't last 24 hours. poor quality and very disappointed. taped it but looks horrible. disappointed in KY
5,Bought as a gift,This is the second time I've bought this is a gift for my step dad's motorcycle and he loves it.
3,"Works well, smells funny","I'm not sure why the leather care creams and conditioners have stopped smelling like leather. This product works okay, but smells like stale pizza. I won't be using it again, because of the smell."
5,review on adapter,I was looking for a adapter that would convert all my little tapes from a camcorder to a video size for the VCR. This worked out very well. And I can now watch all those hours we taped and enjoy. We placed our order on 1 day and recieved it in the mail in just a matter of 2-3 days...fast!
4,Endless love,The CD arrived with a cracked case and the CD skipped lome due to foreign material on the disc. This was a hard to find item and I am pleased to have it.
3,Acutally not that great,"It's really only for the beginner, it gives general information on everything related to the Civic, even custom paintjobs.Not as specific as i had been expecting after reading the other reviews. Tuning the engine is covered in just one small chapter.If you're really into engine tuning, take a look at Honda/Acura engine Performance from Mike Kojima. That is a really good book."
3,Only spanish,"This is a great series, but I was somewhat surprised that there are no English or Spanish subtitles."
3,Nice product but smaller than anticipated,Nice looking product and no complain about the quality thus far.But it was a lot smaller than anticipated.Shipping was very fast.I'd recommend it for someone who understands how small it is.
1,Complete piece of junk.,"I bought this for my pony-obsessed daughter for Christmas, mostly because it was the only way to get the Breezie ""Zipzee"" (one of the main Breezies in the new movies). Thank goodness I wasn't expecting much out of this toy after reading reviews on the other playsets, because it didn't even last a day! After I assembled the ""braiding"" handle and my daughter quickly learned how to operate it herself, she came out not an hour later in tears because it had fallen apart. Not the handle you snap on, mind you. That was still firmly attatched. The rest of the mechanism had more or less disintegrated as she used it! Fortunately she gets enough use out of Zipzee and Daffidaisy that it wasn't too much of a loss that I had to throw it away only hours after opening the box. So, unless you're really after Zipzee or Daffidaisy, don't waste your money on this junky thing that could potentially be a choking hazaard for younger siblings. Horrible!!!"
1,Adorable--yes; Durable--NO,"Sorry, I have to agree with my fellow whiners....my handle didn't even make it to through the set up stage. It fell out after the second crank. Maybe I'm not as gifted as the three year old or maybe you were lucky to get one from a non-defective batch. Either way it's going back as soon as I find out where it was bought. It's really too bad because it's cute as a button but not worth the disappointment on my girls' faces."
2,Cute but...,this is a bit hard for little kids to get the hang of. The small pieces disappear quickly and my daughter lost interest in is just as fast.
5,"This Toy is Durable. Please, Stop Whining and Complaining!","I absolutely love the My Little Pony Petal Parlor. It hasn't fallen apart on me even once. The ponies that come with it are really cute. I have no problem braiding their hair with this toy. The braids come out quite well and with barely any tangling. I don't know what people are fussing about. In my opinion, you're just not being careful, reading the instructions properly, or rushing to get it together. I'd say you're even breaking deliberately and claiming it's not durable. The same goes for the other playsets. My advice to you, quit whining and complaining. Just enjoy the ponies if you don't like the toy."
5,Petal Parlor rocks!,"The petal parlor rocks! It comes with Daffidazey who has a cool fabric cutie mark and pretty long hair, and a Breezie pony named Zipzee. Some of the packages come with a bonus tiara (looks like a crown to me) and mine did. You use the jewels that come with the seperatley sold ponies to decorate the tiara. Good thing it fits even older kids! The braiding thing comes in handy. 5 stars!!!Feedback from SILVERGLOW"
4,Good starter spy gear,"Not a bad toy. My son got this when he was three, and all he liked to play with was the darts (I thought they were fun, too). However, he quickly lost all of the darts, or the dog chewed them up. The flashlight points out of the briefcase which is a sort of cool spy idea. The motion alarm was annoying for the adults, but fun for my son. And the briefcase has a ""secret"" compartment, so overall, not a bad set as an introduction to spy gear. Yes, there is definitely empty room in the briefcase, but that is for your child to use their imagination and add extra items, in my opinion."
4,completely underrated,"I love this CD. I think I got it around the time it came out, but didn't get into it 'til much later. But it's been a classic for me. Noone seem to have heard of him or his music and that's a pity. and I've never heardof any other CD by him. Does anyone know if he has more music out, maybe under different name? I carve for more music by him."
4,sovory = smooth grooves,all i'll say is track 5 is enough reason to buy this album its an excellent song
1,Warwick's efforts in the field of AI are laughable,"First came across Kevin Warwick with his ""In the Mind of the Machine"" some years back. It is cringingly badly written, full of egotistical self-reference, and mainly downright silly. Apparently Warwick's new machines will take control of their human masters and turn them into toiling slaves condemned to long hours of manual labour. This thesis is obviously absurd - what is the point in expending resources on a species that is hopelessly inept at an activity in which machines excel ?Warwick's obsession with stunts like embedding a chip in his arm so that his every movement can be tracked begs the question : ""would I ever want to know where Kevin Warwick is at any moment in time?"".Avoid"
3,Interesting book,"I would have liked to hear more of this experiment. From the writer experience, it appears that a body can be directly linked to a computer to do simple tasks like driving a wheel chair.The possibiliy of directly linking a computer to a brain as quite an exciting possiblity. I also agreed with the writer that it could be quite a blessing to many people that are incapicitated in some way."
1,DOA Twice,"Don't buy these, they are total garbage. They won't turn on at all, I followed all of the instructions and still nothing. Avoid this."
2,Don't Bother,Not a worth while purchase. You will be wasting your money on headphones that work some of the time. When your tv is getting low volume feed (soft/whisper dialogue for example) you'll get nothing but static - imagine watching a movie and going through this every 5-10 minutes). I was told from RCA that this is unavoidable and that I should consider using the headphones for listening to stereo music only. Although this may be fine for some people...I wouldn't spend your money on a product that has blatent limitations. Trust me when I say there are much less expensive products that tower in comparison.
1,Piece of Gar-Bage,"The phones have never worked right. I thought I had a defective transmitter and exchanged them for another and the thing still did not work. The green light came on for a second and them went off completely. No matter how many times I tried to re-connect the transmitter, it never worked right. There is NO technical support on the RCA website for these phones at all. Don't waste your time or your money."
2,These headphones suck!,"I first thought these headphones would be a dream, but not after I tried them. When I first recieved these ""miracle"" headphones, I discovered that the batteries in the headphones had to be first charged-what a pain it was to have to wait 24 hours before I could use these ""wireless wonders."" When the time came to use the headphones, I also heard a sharp whistling noise. My television didnt turn up high enough to block out the sound. Now, after 6 weeks of owning them, I'm ready to get rid of them."
2,"Dependable but, BUY THE RCA WHP 141","Seriously lifeless sound quality and on the heavy side. I have both the RCA150 & RCA WHP141. Look while the 150's are very dependable and sound okay, if you're interested in MUCH BETTER overall sound quality; buy the RCA WHP-141. The 141's are equally more comfortable as they're lighter and stay on your head better. They're much more comfortable while lying in bed as well.These 2 headsets are worlds apart as far as sound quality goes. It's actually that noticeable. I just don't use the 150's because of a real difference in quality. In fact, if my 141's ever stop working, I'll buy another set of 141's. I use my headset primarily to listen to talk radio every night before falling asleep. I occasionally listen while watching a movie or listening to music. The 141's really shine then. Either way, Music, TV or spoken word, the RCA 141's are clearly better."
1,Useless,"Charges for minutes before stopping. Have to play around with the jack. Returned to the store for a new pair, thinking something was loose. Same thing with this pair. Also, while trying to use them, a conversation from our cordless phone started coming through them (clearly). TV sound not clear. Waste of $50. They're going back to the store, again, for good."
3,"Technical difficulties, easy to fix","Now I read all the reviews here and saw that most people who scored it low said they would work for a second and turn off. I was having the same problem with them, but it has a simple solution. Simply turn up the volume on the source (TV, Radio, Computer). These headphones will only operate if the source is kind of loud, but since the headphones have a volume control on them, it's not a problem. The only real problem I have with these headphones is the noise that you hear. As another reviewer stated, there is a sharp whistling noise that does not go away. Good headphones for the money, but if you're willing to spend more, go for the $130 IOGEAR GBMHKIT Bluetooth stereo headphones."
4,Good value for late night tv watching...,"I just realized I had been using these now for about two years watching TV late at night with no problems. Original batteries are still working well, still in good physical shape and still the same sound quality. It is very nice to have a product that does what you intended it to for a good amount of time and I thought I would mention it.Sound quality is fine for my TV use. I would suspect that one might not be as happy with them for serious music (I use a wired set of Sony's for music) use. So 5 for mechanical value and 3 for sound quality."
1,"Wow, they weren't kidding","The reviewer who wrote, ""This is the worst possible thing I have ever bought."" speaks the truth. I saw these for a really great price and figured they couldn't be that bad....Was I ever wrong. Either they are full of static, won't recharge unless you unplug and re=plug in the AC adapter SEVERAL times, or the thing just literally shuts off after 30 seconds for no reason at all. horrible, horrible product. RCA should be fined for making this."
1,PAINFUL in more than one way.,"There are some major cons to these headphones.-These headphones are very uncomfortable. They have the look of an over-ear style headphone but the earpeices are too small to fit completely over your ears. They end up pressing your ears flat against your head, which becomes extremely painful when you're wearing these for extended periods of time.-As the battery drains you find yourself having to adjust the frequency to get rid of static.-They do not handle bass well. If your listening to music with alot of bass or watching a movie with explosions and such the sound becomes distorted.-The base has an auto off feature. Your input device's volmue must be turned to the maximum level. If your input volume is not at a high level and you come to a quiet part of a song or movie it may stop transmitting, leaving you with white noise until the sound becomes loud again."
2,Incorrect Description,"I ordered this book under the pretense that is was in ""good"" condition. However, upon opening the package I noticed the cover was bent and torn, and several pages were being held to the binding by masking tape. I would give this item a ""poor"" condition status. I am very displeased with the book."
3,Outdated,The book is a good reference for the overall general concept of materials. This text does not include up to date materials.
1,Insufficient for engineering,I strongly believe this book is not proper reference if somebody would like to learn about the behavior of steel as a civil engineering material. The authors talk about the material as if the reader is well aware of the behavior and wants to refresh his/her knowledge.It is not useful at all!
1,A Cast of Corbies,I did not receive the book I ordered. Instead I received a childrens book titled The Cheerios Christmas Play Book! The book had a bar code sticker on it with the correct title; but it was on the wrong book. Not A Cast Of Corbies.
4,A beautiful book that grabs your heart!,"Can anything else change exasperation to laughter quite so quickly as a little girl's arms thrown around your neck in exuberant love? Each page of My Daughter, My Joy is a remembrance written by parents of daughters, accompanied by illustrations that are stunningly, colorfully beautiful! I was moved to tears more than once, remembering the beauty of my own daughter at her birth, her tightly curled little fists holding my heart fast in their grasp. Now 21 (yesterday), I gave this book to her, and I hope that she'll give it to her own daughter when the time comes. I greatly recommend this book for fathers, mothers, and their daughters as a beautiful giftbook to treasure!"
4,Daughter Book,A wonderful gift item for either a mother or a daughter. Expresses the bond and joys of mothering girls.
5,Nobody clears away the cobwebs like Carl Sagan,"Some of the material repeated his earlier articles and books, but it was worth reading again. Sagan does not apologize for shining an intense--and unflattering--spotlight on many cherished but foolish notions. Bunk is bunk, whether it's popular or not. The two or three pages on his ""baloney detector"" (logical fallacies used to support a lot of pseudoscience) are worth the price of the book."
4,skeptics 101,I am a skeptic so I don't have any significant issues with the position Sagan presents here. Indeed I thought he made a strong case for skepticism with a lot of interesting examples. My complaint is that for someone like me that is already reasonably versed in the basis of skepticism it is pretty elementary. It was interesting to learn about specific instances of strange superstition in history and more recently but ultimately Sagan's delivery devotes far more wordage to communicating his message than necessary for anyone but those completely new to critical thinking.
3,"Good, but foolish political opinions.","Sagan has written a brilliant book about the need for scientific, rational thought. However, his left wing political advice fails to use that mode of thinking. Sagan is (was) a public intellectual, with deep knowledge of specific subjects, who presumes to offer advice in fields of which he's ignorant."
1,A Big Jumble of Crap,"This book is worthless. It's not even worth reviewing. Carl Sagan doesn't address any particular occurance in detail (maybe a paragraph), he just generalizes things. Essentially this book is a waste of time. Read some Joe Nickell instead.The author talks about aliens and UFOs, but he doesn't review any of the important cases. You won't learn anything after finishing this book. He doesn't even show pictures of the things he calls fake.I'm a skeptic myself, but I think this is the most overrated book of the ""skeptic genre."" This is only for lazy people. I wouldn't suggest this book to somebody in an attempt to convert them, because, like I said, it's worthless. It may, however, put them to sleep."
1,explains why people believe wierd things,"However, this can be explained by:'People are stupid'Read 'Cosmos' by Sagan instead."
5,Excellent!,"Carl Sagan rules!He's a deep sensitive being that doens't throw out the heart in the name of the head!He's a tremendous model in my mind - and heart - for critical scientic thinking. WOW!Saying all that, there is still room for the mystery and the beauty and power of the unknown and the miracles that do transpire in what we call Life.ENJOY!!.:."
3,Average,"Did not enjoy this book as much as Sagan's others. I did think his thoughts on auditory ""hallucinations"" and his explanation was fascinating."
1,Refuge,"The world is flat, a man cant live at sustained speeds over 20mph, man can't fly and the Titannic can't sink. All proven science from different points in history. This book is a refuge for cowards. Use your minds to seek truth. Not what some feaux scientist tells you."
4,We all need more of a baloney detection kit.,"I love this book, mostly because it goes a long way towards reinforcing everything I already believe. Carl Sagan is such a wonderful writer, with such a real, human personality--nothing like the detached scientist stereotype. However, I can see where people who strongly believe the opposite of what I believe might not be convinced. Still a fascinating book and I recommend it to anyone."
5,Carl Sagan at His Best,"I have read many, many books on science and this is easily the finest I have ever read. It truly is Carl Sagan at his best, and that is saying something.As a former high school Physics teacher, I know only too well how poorly the concept of scientific thought is taught in our schools today. If I were still teaching, this book would be required reading in my class."
5,The lights will come on.,"This book is not currently available, but should be reprinted. It debunks myths, and who doesn't want to know the truth behind claims. It gives a perspective I didn't previously have."
3,Science as Whistling in the Dark,"Well, Brother Sagan (RIP) saw it coming, and he tried to put his finger in the dike, but he doesnt really understand it, and he debunks what is too easy to debunk, without acknowledging the true mysteries that Science as-yet is clueless about, e.g. Synchronicity, Prayer, Near-Death-Experience, Experience of Holy Spirit or Kundalini, Cosmic Consciousness, Multidimensionality, Parallel Universes, etc. etc. Tackling UFOs is too easy. Jung did it before Sagan, and with more insight.But the chapter on 'Baloney Detection' is a good and valuable synopsis of critical thinking that should be required in all high schools.All in all, this book strikes me as more revealing of the limitations, ignorance and superstitions of Western Scientism, than of the 'madness of crowds'.And, anyway, the Demons really _are_ out there! Whistling in the Dark wont make 'em go away for long!a guide to Tipler, Penrose, and Capra;"
3,Not impressed,"This book really doesn't do it for me. I didn't learn much from the arguments that Sagan presents. I was expecting more of a scientific approach. Sagan points out an incredible amount of fallacies and it becomes very redundant. There are some good bits of info here and there, but not what I wanted from someone with such high credentials. I think this book is great for the gullible, but not the already skeptic."
5,The best book I've read so far!,"Nine years ago I read ""Les Miserables,"" and I thought that book, which is a masterpiece, would be my favorite for life. How could anyone top that? My champion of nine years has been dethroned! The ""Demon-Haunted World,"" should be read by every person on the planet ESPECIALLY Americans and even more so for our politicians. I could talk (write) about this book for a very long time. Please read this book. You will not regret it."
5,A candle in the dark,"I am a scientist who was greatly influenced by Dr. Carl Sagan, and must applaud his last and greatest work. It clears a path through superstition and ignorance straight to science and knowledge. This book sparks the mind and encourages the sense of wonder that science creates."
5,Required reading,"Carl Sagan provides a strong yet humane antidote against the effects of the soothesayers, crystal healers and entrail-readers. While he won't change their beliefs in the unproven and unprovable, and he can probably never drown out our somehow inborn fear of things that go bump in the night, many of us need a gentle innoculation against slopping thinking from time to time. Just such an innoculation is provided here, in a mixture of wonder, humility, and compassion that reminds us again why we still miss Dr. Sagan."
4,A great book,"Love this book. Sagan presents his ideas logically and thoughtfully. The only problem with it is that Sagan seams to believe there is NO hope for human without science and scientific education. And that is not entirely true. Without science, we will be in the dark, sure, but we will still exist. The marrage of Skepticism and Wonder, however, do make the world that much more iridescent. This book should be a must read for every high school and college student. The book is not written for scientists, but for the general public."
4,One Of His Best Books,"Carl Sagan is in top form writing about pseudoscience here, but I had to wonder about the distance he has evolved from views set forth in his 1960s books, especially on the subject of extraterrestrial visitation. I just read a book called COSMIC TEST TUBE which details the evolution of all ideas about the existence of other life in the Universe, and Sagan's views are described as having been much more open--at least in his early years--to the prospect that alien visitation occurred sometime in Earth's history. I'm sorry he didn't use this book as more of an opportunity to clue us in on how his perspective has shifted and why!"
4,A must read for all college science majors like myself,"Sagan discusses how in today's society science is looked upon strongly to solve many problems. Yet, the incredible amount of ""psuedoscience"" that fascinates our society is taken to be at full value. Sagan discusses questionable scientific topics as UFO's, telepathy and so on. His main point is to remind us that all we have to answer today's question with is science. If we don't fully appreciate the scientific method and put aside our social tendencies we could lose it. I believe any would be medical student read this as they typically ignore most of the importance of their undergraduate education."
3,Interesting Book,"It was fun reading this book as this was my very next book after I finished Erich Von Daniken's Book ""Chariots of God?"". The sharp contrast between the style and content of the two authors made this a very interesting reading.Mr. Sagan seems to have a taken a very hard look at the ideas and theories that have been with the mankind for ages.Mr. Sagan should have avoided ""The other guy is wrong"" attitude."
3,"Timely, Good, but Too Long","Carl Sagan's message from the 1980s is even more appropriate today than it was when he wrote it. His main theme--that abandoning scientific methodology for mysticism and religious faith is fraught with peril--feels like it a well-timed rebuttal to the ""intelligent design"" proponents and global warming skeptics. Nevertheless, you get Sagan's point by about half-way through the book; from then on you begin to feel that he's on a bit of a rant."
4,Pretty good,"I found this book to be well written, but sometimes unfocused. The first dozen chapters or so concentrate far too much on miniscule topics (such as alien abduction and the like), and it is only in the final half of the book that the good meat comes out. Once you reach The Dragon in My Garage, you should be home free."
2,"embittered rear-guard rant, prolonged battle with straw men.","Poor Carl-- he alienates the very people he wishes to reach by LAYING DOWN THE LAW and subverting his own message. I would have felt more empowered if he had given more time to the anti-scientific forces that kept, say, Chiropractry out of mainstream medicine for so long. As it was I felt preached-at and talked-down-to. Ultimately, non-scientists are structurally denied access to the equipment we would need to test any of our hypotheses about the world-- so unless they want to allow free access to the super-conducting super-colider we non-scientists are out of luck. No test, no respect."
3,Sagan Book Review,"I personally am not a big fan of this book. I do not agree with a lot of the points that Sagan tries to make, and I find some of the chapters completely irrelevant and interesting. The purpose I had in purchasing this book was for a class that I will be taking this upcoming fall. I do, however, respect what Sagan has to say, and it has done well in exposing me to very different ways of thinking from my own."
4,The demon haunted world one bright candle,"I love this book! I am reminded of ,Harry Houdini and his efforts to dispell the psychic world. I've always liked Sagan and reading The Demon Haunted world makes me feel as if he is still around. As far as the condition there are a few pages that a child has scribbled on but not so bad as to cause me to return it.A. E."
4,The Demon Haunted World,"Carl Sagan was a great man and had a great way of explaining the awesomeness of the universe to the average man or woman. This book is like that. It allows us to understand logical, rational thaught which we sometimes allow ourselves to ignore.At the very least it will teach you how to win an argument."
4,"Truth, but not unmitigated","Anybody reading this book should take the time to learn from and enjoy it. Then, he or she ought to read Zen And The Art Of Motorcycle Maintenance by Robert Pirsig, and compare what Sagan says to Pirsig's musings on Squareness and Quality."
5,Everyone should read this book.,"This book should be required reading to graduate from high school. I rank it among the best ten nonfiction books I've read in my 50+ years. The author touches on a variety of subjects including mans belief in demons, the inquisition, alien abduction and false memories, astrology, astronomy, science, psuedoscience, and popular beliefs. It's a good read and could be educational. It was for me."
5,This should be required reading in High School,ever wonder if something was complete BS. This book assists in filtering all the BS out. This book should be required reading in 8th or 9th grade.
3,"Good, but not that good.","First off I'm a liberal atheist, and a fairly cranky one at that. The ability of people to have beliefs that fly in the face of all reason and evidence never ceases to amaze me. So, I basically agreed with much of Sagan's thesis before I picked up the book. The problem is that this book is not terribly well written or planned. Sagan bounes along haphazardly through many subjects, each of them on their own worthy of discussion, but with only the most superficial connection between them. Personally, I would have much prefered a more rigorous, dry approach to the topics he discuss. Such a book would not be very successful with a larger audience, which is a part of the very problem Sagan bemoans in this book. All that said, if this book increases one person's skepticism it accomplished a worthwhile function. I'm sure for the truely inquiring there's a much better book, but I have yet to read it."
5,Enlightening Book,Too bad Carl Sagan has passed away... he seemed to know quite a bit about this world. His book was fascinating!
5,A Must Read for Enquiring Minds!,"Thus book is a good intro to the folly of human thinking and our need to create myths (from religion to UFO's). It will teach you to look at things with a more skeptical eye.written in style, it is a must read for anyone searching for deeper truths."
4,Is There a God?,Carl Sagan dedicates much of the book to extoling the virturesof science. One gets the feeling that for him science is the sourceof ultimate truth. I believe that there are limits to the scientific method and wish that he would have given them equal air time as well.
5,Required Reading.,"If you like Carl Sagan, Joseph Campbell, Leonard Schlain, james Randi, and other firm, wonderful, enthusiastic authors of science, reason, and true wonder, buy this.This should be required reading in school, this book is incredible and, above all, important."
3,Demons? Hah!,"Easy to read, fascinating subject matter, but kind of obvious content.Anyone with half a brain will already know most of what Carl talks about in this book. Let me rephrase that and say that skeptics or people bound in science will. Believers in ghosts, UFOs, demons, etc could definitely benefit from reading this book, so long as you genuinely keep an open mind. Of course, we all will choose which sources we want to trust, so that may be hard for some.From my own experience I have always been in love with the phenomenon of the supernatural or the unknown. I want to believe more than I actually do believe. I've never had a true experience, and when I do I look at it rationally and decide that it must be x, y, or z... and not immediately assume it is something ""unexplainable""Anyway, long story short, it is a very quick and easy read but most of the content is fairly obvious stuff. It may be for some more than others. Perhaps a good intro into this world of science and/or pseudoscience."
4,Some good philosopy,"Not light reading for me, but thought provoking for sure. He attacks ideas and beliefs that I have wondered about and some that were totally new to me."
2,Writer is all over the place,This writer is all over the place. His thinking is very hard to follow. I got it for my Sociology class and I still don't understand anything I read in this book.
4,Demon Haunted World,The order took over a month to arrive in Australia and the quality was not as good as expected. No images in book.
5,Near-death experience !!!,Of course Mr. Sagan's style is a little crabby: he was dying of cancer!This is a great book. I give it 5 stars.
5,First class,First class by all means.Yes! It is stimulation.Yes! It is intelligent.Yes! It is unusual.And YES! It is the most intriguing book ever written in this arena.Only a well-informed scholar could have written such an explosive book.
3,There are better (and shorter!) books on the subject,"This may be a good intro to skeptical thought, but it falls short by stretching points so thin that they break. Sagan didn't know when to stop while trying to make his points.Martin Gardners's ""Fads and Fallicies in the Name of Science"" does a far better job addressing psuedo-science by staying on solid ground, and by making the same points in a hundred less pages."
4,Great Place to Start,Sagan was instrumental in bringing science and his fascination of the cosmos to more of the mainstream. This book is arguably the best example of this. He advocates for Science in a sea of ignorance while being even-handed and acknowledging the struggles of Science. He stresses the need to be skeptical and think critically. Unfortunately most of those who read this book will probably already have some degree of skepticism. I hope more people can discover the freedom (of the mind) this book brings.
4,"Great, with reservations","The Demon Haunted World is at its best when Sagan focuses on the virtues of Science, skepticism and their potential role in education. However, the middle chapters of this work - which labor the point that ghost, aliens and the occult are improbable explanations for more prosaic events - begin to wear thin after 100 or so pages. I recommend the first and last of the book wholeheartedly, the middle could have used a bit more red ink."
3,Good,"I found Mr. Sagan's book interesting and lucid. However, I think he shoots for some easy targets- astrology, alien possession, clairvoyance, and the like. Granted, these beliefs are absurd. But Mr. Sagan fails to examine the need behind the beliefs. Many people- intelligent ones included- turn to new age religion because of an inadequate understanding of science and because traditional religion has let them down. Science may stimulate the mind, but not necessarily the soul,and while science has improved our lives in many respects, I'm not so sure it has taught us how to get along with each other. Logical thinking is very important, but it is only one component of thinking- not thinking itself."
1,Dull,This book could have been written in 20 pages. I do not see the need to have 400 pages explaining that aliens and dragons are not real.
2,boring,"I think the most relevant comment I've seen is from Cathy Sahu above, ""Who Are You Talking to, Dr. Sagan?""I'll save you 457 pages:Science = goodIf you don't believe in alien abductions the book is nothing more than preaching to the choice. And pretty poor preaching to the choir at that. The book attempts to be encyclopedic and ends up having as much depth as your average encyclopedia article. Sagan ignores evidence contrary to his position. He glosses over difficulties his position brings up in order to offer a more unified-looking front. He loves science but seems uninterested in the science of science, having absolutely nothing to say about the philosophy of science."
2,Predictable,Hightly predictable apology for science; interesting (and required) maybe for the non-scientist. No trace of humour.
5,It made me love science.,"Being, a computer programmer & history buff I'm lacking in true scientific knowledge beyond my general ed classes in college. I'm a cynic with conspiracies that always float around & this book has given irrefutable proof of how to combat such sudo-sciences. It's opened my eyes to what is real science and what is tabloid science & how to tell the difference. I've a new found love for something that was seemingly boring. GREAT BOOK!"
5,A classic written by the master of millions.,"This book can be reading for everybody and have to be readed in everyone science class in the early years. Don't worry about no knowing someting deeper about science, you only need know reading and you will have a really good time with this book."
5,Better than words can express,"Having read all of the reviews above this one, I find that I have little to add to the previous praise. However I would like to say that I find it quite saddening that the kinds of people who would not consider reading this book are EXACTLY the kinds of people who SHOULD be reading this book. The world lost a great deal when it lost Carl Sagan. I only hope another candle burns brightly enough for us to see it soon."
5,"Scholarly, Thoughtful, and Horse-Wise","I used this book as my primary source for my bachelor's thesis project. It is by far the most through and intellectual book of Renaissance and Baroque equestrian art which I have read. Liedke is an educated, high-level horseman with a real understanding of the finer considerations of the art of horsemanship. Included is commentary of the birth of dressage and the ""Classical"" riding style, relative art historical comparisons between works, topical commentary on other pubications, and many beautiful plates of some of the most famous monuments extant, viewed from the unique perspective of the horseman. I also recommend Laura Camins' ""Glorious Horsemen,"" although dressage enthusiasts will take issue with many of her statements."
2,Nature of Existence we already know,"Don't expect any insightful wisdom here. It's just a catalogue cut of the various beliefs in the world. Nothing deep, mainly interviews with clergy and weirdos."
2,weird illustrations,"I decided to pick this book up because I liked some other books of this serie. I have no prior knowledge of Barthes's theories, so I can't say whether the book itself is accurate. Overall the book is easy to follow, and the author seems very knowledgeable on the subject.My biggest problems are the illustrations. I don't like the drawing style itself, but the content of the pictures perplex me. The drawings are somewhat crude to say the least, and I couldn't understand the relationship between the picture and the text. I can understand there being a little cartoon of people in an orgy when the text is talking about Barthes' perception of Sade's literary work.pictures. But a lot of the other illustration had sexual content where I couldn't see its relevance to the text. I expect to see that kind of art in Indy comics, not in a book that talks about semiotics and the like."
1,A total disgrace to literary theory and criticism,This book is an extremely superficial review of Barthes' theories. The illustrations are disgusting and totally not appropriate for this book. Roland Barthes was one of the greatest mid-20th century critics and philosophers and this is not the type of book he deserves. Whoever is interested in Roland Barthes is definitely not looking for this type of book. It is a total disgrace to his books and his persona.
1,very bland compared to War is Hell,I got this CD at a show they were playing at here and unfortunatly had to leave before they came on. Im somewhat glad I did because more than likely they would have played a lot of the tracks from this cd which is terrible. No emotions come out through the lyrics or music in this CD and in my honest opinion it sounds real close to rap( which isnt bad if they were a rap group but there not). I cant even sit through a whole track without stopping the CD which is why it gets 1 star.
2,disappointing,"this album was pretty disappointing for me or maybe my standards were just set to high since war is hell is one of my favorite hardcore albums ever. i know the band's hearts were in the right place when they wrote this album (and doing a concept album for a hardcore record is a pretty ballsy move in itself which is why im giving it two stars instead of one) but the majority of the songs fall flat on their faces. theres just no energy here like war is hell had. i never once really thought the warriors sounded anything like rage against the machine but the zack de la rocha comparisons will probably fly left and right because of the majority of the vocal work on this album. theres a lot of moments on this album that feel almost nu-metalish which is probably the biggest deterrent for me personally (akin to that of parts of ramallah - kill a celebrity). the only track i thoroughly enjoyed was ""and yet they say."" maybe theyll get it right next time."
1,I can't give any sort of review on this,"First let me say I am a HUGE Kevin Costner fan. But, I can't give a review because when I clicked on the Kevin Costner 3 pack to see what movies were in the pack they weren't listed. I was really disappointed that I have no idea what three movies are included in this package. I don't want to buy three movies that I already have. I was really interested in this item, but now don't know if I would be interested in it or not."
1,Vastly overpriced,"Well, it works, but $64 for a passive F-F HDMI coupler? Give me a break! Equivalent product is $14 at Best Buy."
2,mary jane bamboo shoes,"I bought these in my size- however the elastic in the back cut in the my heal. Also, I did not wear these often and they now have holes in the sides."
3,Needs a proprietary adjustment tool,"I bought this sight because of the concept. The design however I believe needs one improvement, because...of the 4 typical A1 or A2 front sight adjustment tools that I have I am not able to adjust this sight as described. (The prongs of the 4 tools in my possession are not long enough to disengage the lock pin enough to adjust the sight without damaging it.)Because of the thickness of the sight's dual base.I've read the description of this sight and no where does it allude to the use of a proprietary adjustment tool so just to warn any potential buyer....when you install this make sure you have a tiny screwdriver or the such to make your adjustments.All that being said....I DO like the sight! Once sighted in and set, unless you swap out your rear sight, you won't be adjusting your front sight anyway.hope this helps."
2,"Meprolight AR-15 A-2, not real happy",Bought this to replace similar sight that had lost it's glow over the years. Works just as it should. I kinda like the base and the glowing part are separate for more accurate adjustment. But it is NOT the same size as a regular A-2 front sight. Meaning your standard front sight adjustment tool will not fit. Real pain to install and adjust without being able to use my front sight adjustment tool. I'd give it an A+ for function. But a F- for ease of installation and adjustment.
4,Works good. Beware if trying to use in non specified sight base.,"I actually put this into a Magpul flip-up front site. Rather forcefully actually, and rethreaded the platic as a result. Basically using this as a drop compensation with an Eotech. Works as described. Should be fine with specified front sights. Wish they included a disposable tool for installation."
1,waste of your Money,"Sight dot to small to see with glasses, does not mount in sight receiver hole, no tool to mount it."
5,"AMAZING ""RESULTS""",I LOVE Cathe's Gym Style Series. I've done them for a month and got amazing results!!! They are so much fun and not boring at all. Cathe is just amazing and a great instructor! Gym Style is great upper body workout.
5,Snippets of Sage Advice,"Small morsels of wisdom and inspiration that are extremely palatable and easy to carry with you throughout the day. This is a book that at first glance would seem light in content; however, the true value comes as you weigh the thoughts in your heart and mind. Dr. Ruth's book is truly an inspiration -- in concept and in actualization. A great gift book for anyone, including yourself."
5,The perfect book for anyone!,"I love that this book is written in a ""light"" manner - nothing too heavy, with just the right dose of thought-provoking wisdom to remind me how to focus on the positives. I keep several on hand as they make the perfect gift for any occasion!"
5,Finally Found This Jewel,"Just received this cd from you today through the mail. I've been looking for one particular song for a very long time, ""The Image Of You"". WHUR played it last week during their Cafe Lunch Special; I called the station; found out it was by Scott Jarrett. The album is out of print but AMAZON saved the day. The album is excellent. It is very inspirational and airy with a strong jazz flavor. In addition to ""The Image of You"", I liked ""Pictures"" and ""I was a Fool"". The featured artists along with Scott Jarrett were great."
3,Works as described,This will only work to combine sattelite signal with on the air antennae . It will not work with cable systems.
1,Very disappointing,"Whenever an author spends half his words telling you what he's going to tell you later, you know he doesn't have much to tell you. I saw a new update is out on this one and perhaps it's been improved but I think most people would be best served reading product descriptions and reviews in the Apple App Store."
4,...see other Sifu Hayward review.,"Thanks, Sifu Hayward. This dvd and the other one have been very beneficial; easy to follow."
4,The Destruction of Atlantis,"Frank Joseph brings a new outlook on the subject of Atlantis considered taboo by most academicians. An easy read with enough theory to make it worth reading. He continues to chip away at the legend. Right or wrong, those dedicated to answers will solve this mystery which will be a sad day for some. Half the fun of this topic is the journey and the other is playing the ""What if"" game. Atlantis is the biggest puzzle in the history of mankind. Also a complete waste of time just like looking for Troy. Oops! We found that one. Keep searching Frank Joseph! It's out there."
3,"Solid effort, worth the read","This is certainly a very thought provoking book--and a welcome relief from many books on this subject that have outrageous (although often entertaining) conclusions. If you're familiar with Joseph's magazine, you'll find this book to be similar. There is a blend of intriguing, often insightful and well researches material mixes with not exactly scholarly writing and sometimes borish details. The book also frays towards the end (an unfortunate common trait of most books on this subject).I'm fairly convinced that Joseph is on to something, but I can't say I'm sold on it. Joseph's bibilical quotes--aside from those taken from Revelations--are largely unconvincing--many just too far out of context. The timing for the Exodus/bronze age correlation is half a millenium off. Still, it's very good food for thought and very well worth a read. Far more, in fact, than most books on Atlantis."
3,More of a question than a review,"The author's theory regarding the impact of a comet around 1200 BC brings to mind one question: Where is the unmistakable physical evidence of the impact event.When an object like a comet or meteor collides with our planet moving at 12 to 20 kilometers per second, the amount of energy and radition released can exceed the largest thermonuclear explosion. Even is there is no crater because of a high altitude air burst, the physical evidence is still obvious. For example, the resulting smoke and dust settling out would be visible in polar ice core samples. The 1908 Siberian explosion at Tunguska is an recent example of a small, high altitude impact event. And even 3000 years is not long enough for erosion to obliterate the evidence.Based on this lack of physical artifacts, I must remain skeptical of the author's comet impact theory. Good try - no cigar."
3,Depressing,"More literature focused on devastation and deathly destruction!! Television and newspapers already deluge us with too many stories of this type. We don't need more.Although he offers some interesting information and writes well, Joseph's technique of basing his assumption that Atlantis was a late Bronze Age society on a combination of material from a variety of writers, many of whom believe Atlantis existed long before that time, offers only confusion to the knowledgeable reader."
4,"Aspiring Authors, Get the Inside Scoop About the Publishing Business",Brian Hill and Dee Power have written this inside look into the business of writing with a natural and approachable style. The light handed touches of humor and the down to earth language made this a very enjoyable read. I have never written an Amazon Review until now but was compelled to add my voice to the others. Count me as a very satisfied consumer.
1,"Title is Bestseller, Little Else","This book may sell because of it's title, and little else. Writing style is so-so, no real nuts and bolts info. Of course, being on a major bestseller list is fantastic and the authors within the book say so. But, and it's a big but, if you want to know how to become a bestselling author, this isn't your guide. As the book buyer for a publishing association, I won't recommend it--better books to help create marketing plans/strategies to move books would be John Kremer's 1001 Ways to Market Your Books and Brian Jud's Beyond the Bookstore."
5,Excellent well-written and worth the trees,This book gives you the knowledge to create complex 3d graphics. Wether you are new to the product or an experienced user this book is for you. It gives an in-depth knowledge that is pretty usefull. I can highly recommend the other books in the series (vol. II & III).
2,Not for beginners,"This was my first book that I purchased for learning 3d studio max.. I also bought the fundamental book too.. I've only flip through couples of pages then I put it away to collect dust. The exercise are hard to follow, they gave complete instruction for teaching you a certain command. But you wouldn't find motivation to delve in to the 3d world by building something that's meaningless. The book is only good for advance user as it'll teaches you how to press certain short cut keys and stuff..I found this book hard to comprehend.. even if I'm a immediate user, I wouldn't picked this book, as this is so boring.. It teaches you how to do certain things, but don't tell you much why you are doing it, or why is it necessary to take the steps..there are few other good ones out there if you are a intermediate user..."
4,very bad how-to but excellent reference,"This was the second book i bought for MAX, the first one was for the truly begginner and helped me getting started whereas this one helped me understood EVERY fonction included in this soft."
1,This book can bite my a**.,"If there's a book that can truly screw up your transition from 3dsR4 to 3dsmax, this would be the one. Dont make the same mistake I did."
3,RTFM's!!! then read this book,RTFM's then read this book...the tutorials are not going to be duplicated in any books that are released so stop whinning about it not being for beginners..thats what the manuals are for. Don't WAREZ a product then complain about third party books that are available aren't good for beginners...no company would ever want someone to make a user manual that out did there own manuals and therefore rendering buying the product useless as people would just copy it....I am not saying that all of you wared it but I had never done any 3d modeling ever and once I had done the tut's I had gotten use to MAX's interface..had I never of done those tut's I3DSM would of been alot harder to read.......oh by the way ..read the tut's then this book is awesome!
1,3d MAX vol. 1 Inside MAX,"I'm a new person to 3d Studio MAX with no experience in any other software. I have to say I've found the book extremely complicated. Worse yet there's a lot of technical data but very little practical help. Why can't they show you how to build, say, an Indy car step by step? If it's a book for beginners the material within should reflect that. It should assume nothing."
3,Is it a 10 or a 1,"I am just starting to use 3DS Max and I bought this book to learn the basics. I found that it is 90% theory and 10% action. It assumes that you are familiar with every button and navigational feature of 3DS, which no beginner can claim.If you have a few hundred hours of 3DS Max under your belt and you have spent the necessary weeks or months going through every ""real"" tutorial, then this book is an excellent theoretical look at 3DS Max and can serve you in fine tuning your skills.If you want to jump right in and make your first circle, sphere, or line, this book will make you insane. It's tutorials are practically non-existant and it often uses pages to describe something that should only take a paragraph.If your a beginner its a 1If your advanced its a 10I give it a 5 until I can figure it out!"
4,Works as advertised,"Perfect companion if you have the bike rack. Only reason i did not give it 5 stars was the price, it is quite expensive for what it is."
5,Expensive but does work great,"I really hesitated when considering the purchase. Yakima needs to adjust their pricing as it is quite high. However, it is a great product which is very stable, actually can hold 3 sets of skis and 2 snowboards, or 4 snowboards, or 6 sets of skis! Quickly installed or removed and is very light and easy to store. The clamping mechanism is good to really tightening everything down in the racks and the locking mechanism works very well. Only drawback for people that like to keep their stuff clean, the splashback from the car is insane and completely covers everything in the rack in a dirty film by the time you get home (versus a roof rack)."
5,"Inspirational! Uplifting, true story of perserverance.","""Spirit at Work"" by Lois M. Grant is a wonderful, creatively written true account of Lois' incredible perseverance and how it paid off. In Lois' life, overcome with rheumatoid arthritis, she used every resource she could find to help her win what had been for many years a painful losing battle with her illness.Lois' book touched on many sensitive issues-- internal battles about the reality of spirit, friends' experiences of finding and expressing the truth within themselves, finding harmony with deeply rooted family issues and psychological abuse, and finding true love of oneself.Overall, Lois Grant's book inspired me greatly because no matter how painful her arthritis was, or how many obstacles she ran into, Lois kept on searching, praying, loving and connecting with spirit. It all paid off... but you will have to read the book to uncover all the wonderful stories and details."
4,The title is appropriate to the workout. Finally buzz words that are legit.,"I have other Exhale workouts and this one is the best. It moves quickly, the queues are clear and consistent. The mtn climbers (which they call runs) are hard but good for abs and legs. Overall great workout."
5,GREAT!,"I am 52 and work out almost every day - I have a 4-mile walk DVD and also a yoga/pilates DVD that I use alternately, this is my newest addition to my routine - it is very challenging, I can only go about halfway through, but that is a good thing! My goal is to work up to the entire routine. I also enjoy streaming it through my Amazon Prime account. Thank you!"
2,I did not care for this dvd,"Sorry, but I thought this dvd was boring. I didn't like the couple, Elizabeth seemed like she was hunched over for some parts of it, lots of repetitious moves, the workouts all blended together and for me it was one long snoozefest. Also weird to me was the bouncing in one part, sorry I forgot what section. I just didn't like their form. They're a really mellow couple (maybe a little too mellow for me), and the ab part seemed good, but that's about it. Wish I could have written a better review."
2,Too easy,I thought this workout video was too easy and not challenging for my fitness level. I hardly broke a sweat and did not feel breathless so to speak. I think it would be great for someone just starting out though. It just did not do it for me. I need higher intensity.
2,Not that intense!,"I was disappointed with this DVD. I have enjoyed the other Core Fusion DVDs; while they are not as intense as my other workouts, I could find a place for them in my routine to strengthen and tone, and provide an alternative to some of my heavier workouts. The workouts on this DVD did not hit the right mix of cardio or toning that I expected. The only workout that I will do again on this DVD is the 'Power Sweat' segment. The other workouts don't raise the heart rate, and don't contain a good mix of toning moves. Maybe the diehard Core Fusion fans will enjoy it - but for newcomers, try one of their other excellent DVDs."
4,GOOD WORKOUT,"Another fab workout from core exhale, the workouts are well thought out and really work the Cardio side of things. However, I'm not a big fan of all those mountain climbers as I find that part very repetitive - tests why I gave this 4 stars. This has not deterred me though as I will be getting the Power Sculpt dvd."
2,I was bored after 3 minutes,"With a title of ""pure intensity"" and great reviews I was expecting an intense workout. What I got was a workout that MIGHT be intense for someone who has never worked out a day in his or her life. I did the ""energy moves"" and it was almost a good warmup. I stuck it out for three minutes of the ""cardio blast"" or whatever it's called, and my heart rate was probably right at 100. For an ""intense"" cardio workout, it should be at least 140. It was ridiculous. I'm sorry I wasted $10 on this."
5,MCSE to be - Must Buy,"This is the second test I took, due to following one of the three test paths given in this series of books. Just reading this book and combining it with the Transcender practice tests I passed with 230 points to spare. TCP/IP is supposed to be one of the hardest exams and this book made it easy."
5,Smaller than a telephone book,"a welcome relief from the doorstops I've bought for the core exams and really concise about subnet masking. If you've got this far then you should find this book easy to understand-don't let the liteweight looks fool you, it's really well written. If you've got a Syngress book from one of the other exams then you'll have some trial practice exams on the CD for this anyway. As far as the written questions in the other (larger) books are concerned they're far too easy to be of any use. (The CD in the Syngress book IS worthwhile)."
5,Excellent explanations of difficult topics,"You must buy this book if you want to understand TCP/IP. As a developer of technical training materials, I recognize quality writing and this book delivers."
5,"Very pleased, A++ book","I was given a bread maker and this book for Christmas last year. Being that this was my first time baking my own bread I was worried that my lack of knowledge would make baking bread difficult at first; NOT TRUE. The recipes are easy to follow, the margins have wonderful tips, and best of all every recipe has nutritional values! Get this book, you wont regret it!"
4,Good reference book...,Many useful recipes. Good value. Would recommend to anyone starting our in making their own bread. Looking forward to many years of use.
5,Easy recipes,"These recipes are very easy to follow. Even my kids like trying them. They're tried and true, so the results don't disappoint."
2,Not So Tasty,"I have tried a half dozen recipes from this book so far and I've liked only one of them (Sally Lunn). The pictures are beautiful, the spiral binding is great but the recipes I've tried are mediocre. Maybe it's just me or my machine (Breadman), but recipes from my other cookbooks tend to taste better."
4,Good beginner breadmaking cookbook,"I bought this with my new breadmachine, as I've never been impressed with the recipes that come with the machines. I also have had little success finding good recipes on the web, so I thought I'd try it. I've been experimenting with the recipes ever since. I like that it has a variety of white, wheat, and shaped breads. Some of the recipes are just several variations on the same theme, though, which I probably could have gotten to on my own as I like to experiment. However, overall I am very glad I purchased it and it's a great book for a beginner or for someone who wants to learn how to make and shape a variety of breads, including bagels and other shaped breads. Especially helpful for beginners are the troubleshooting, storing, other introductory pages, and the numerous pictures and hints."
5,A must if you have a bread machine!,"I recently returned a bread machine and bought another so I've tried recipes from two different manuals. Although my sampling is not very extension, I would have to say these recipes are not very good. I decided to purchase Betty Crocker's Best Bread Machine Cookbook and have not been disappointed yet!Because it's from Betty Crocker you can be assured the recipes have been tested extensively. The recipes are simple. There are tips, comments and diagrams in the margins and beautiful photos throughout. It's spiral-bound so it lays flat nicely. I would recommend trying the ""look inside"" feature on Amazon.com so you can see a few pages for yourself.The book is available from Amazon for ~$13. It was a very good investment."
4,Perfect recipes for my breadmaker,I have tried quite a few of these recipes and they all turned out perfect!
5,Great Reference Breadmachine guide,"If you are new at breadmaking or using a breadmachine, this book is very descriptive and easy to understand. I found it helpful as it tells about yeast, and different types of bread flours to use. I also like the spiral bound design of the book itself."
5,the book that should have come in the box for breadmakers,"apologies to david pogue on the titlethis book has an excellent introduction explaininga little about the machines, and ingredients needed to make breadas well as simple problem solving techniques for not quite right loaves.I haven't branched out past a couple basic recipes yet but the others look goodand the basic sandwich bread is a hit.easy to read and use."
5,Lots of Variety,I loved this book for its variety and ease of use. The ingredients are simple to find and measure out. I've been very pleased with the results as they apply to my own bread machine. I was amazed at all the different kinds of breads that are contained between these covers.
4,great cookbook,"I'm not one that usually likes or uses cookbooks but making bread, especially in a breadmaker it is critical to have a good recipe. Have tried several of the recipes from this book and they have all turned out great. That is only part of the reason I like this cookbook though. The way this book is constructed with the spiral wire binding so the book stays open to the recipe you are using and the thick cleanable pages makes you realize that this was a book put together by people that have used cookbooks and know what makes a good one that people will use again and again."
5,Betty Crockers Best Bread Machine Cookbook,As usual Betty Crocker cookbooks won't let you down. These recipes are easy to follow and come out great. My cookbook was purchased used and is like new.
4,betty si the best,easy to follow recipes;using the bread machine at least once a week because of the variety of good recipes; can't wait to try the dessert items
5,Very pleased with book,A wide variety of recipes. I have only made 3 recipes but they have all been tasty. I would recommend..
5,Really an excellent book,"I received this book as a gift with my bread maker a little over a year ago. I've tried ~15 recipes and everything tastes great! I am a novice cook, but by reading the intro sections and stocking my kitchen with common supplies, I can now make great fresh bread with 5-10 min total of actual hands-on time. One note about the book - it seems it grossly underestimates the amount of water needed in the recipes (maybe my flour is more dehydrated than average?), but, by slowly adding water at the beginning of the kneading until it matches the example dough ball pictures in the book, everything turns out fine."
4,good bread book,"I've never owned a bread cookbook before, but now I don't have to buy mixes not knowing what to use to make my own. Because of this book, you can make great breads at a reasonable price. Well worth it."
5,A great cookbook that makes a great gift!,"We purchased a new bread machine along with this cookbook. It offers a tasty selection of easy to make, delicious breads."
5,Got from Library - Have to Own,I made one loaf the day I got the book from the library. Haven't tasted it yet but on the contents and photos alone I have deceided I have to have this book and am ordering it now. I already have 5 or 6 Bread machine cookbooks but this seems to be the best by far and I know it will become the one I use most often.
1,this book is good for making sweet bread,"I can use only two recipes in this book, because lots of recipes for sweet bread. It is not for me. If you like sweet stuff , you should purchase this."
3,So-so,"As a BOOK, this is excellent -- great pictures, clear instructions, well organized, lots of variety. I was salivating as I read through it the first time.However, after trying about half a dozen recipes, I have to say I'm not quite so impressed. The breads didn't taste as good the ingredients would indicate. For example, the onion cheese bread was not particularly cheesy nor onion-y. I tried again without the cheese and had to more than double the onion to get a flavorful result.I guess it's a good starting point. If the recipe comes out how you like it, great; if not, you can experiment. Maybe I've been spoiled by the Internet: I like the feedback and user comments on AllRecipes.com so I have realistic expectations before I decide to use my time and ingredients."
2,A complete disappointment,"I do not like fancy stuff, I just want basic, good roll and bread recipes. The dough recipes are basically non-existant and the bread recipes are all fancy frou-frou stuff. I suppose for someone younger with more exotic tastes, it might be ok. But I did not find even one recipe in this book that I will use."
3,bread machine cook book,"This book is very easy to read and there are pictures everywhere. I am always looking for whole grain recipes and there are some here but perhaps not as many as I had hoped. I have made only a few recipes so far and they turned out fine. I will work my way through the book, except for the small loaves, that will not fit in my large machine. Overall this is a good book with a nice variety."
5,Betty Crocker Bread Machine Recipes,I love this recipe book. I have made a few of the breads in this book and they've come out great! There are helpful tips and advice. Dozens of different types of breads to choose from.
3,Bread Machine Basics,This is good but not as good as it could be. The graphics are lovely. I live overseas and aquired a machine with no instructions. The book could use more helpful hints on how to make changes.
3,Buy this one if you are into unusual or involved recipes,"A beautiful book on the surface. Almost worth the price just for the photos in the intro of what good bread dough should look like. But it's chockful of recipes that just aren't the type you'd make everyday. Lots of unusual recipes using lots of ingredients. I bought this and the Bread Machine Cookbook by German; the Bread Machine Cookbook is our ""go to"" book for day-to-day use. This one we pick up, look at the pretty pictures of loaves of bread and put it back down. Buy the book by German first."
4,Explained the topic well,"Being a sophmore in high school I am taking a physics class. We had to learn about Special Relativity. It was a hard idea to grasp at first, but the book explained it well. I am very glad I came across the book. The only thing I would like different is for it to be not so wordy."
3,Many Answers...Not Much Insight,"From the title of this book, you might expect that it would teach you techniques for coping with brainteaser questions. For the most part, it won't. Instead, what you'll find is a large collection of puzzles and their answers - but very little discussion of the PROCESS of solving brainteasers. Unless your plan is to memorize the contents of this book, and hope that an interviewer's question matches one of your canned answers, you won't find much value here.Much of what's in Kador's book can also be found here:""How Would You Move Mount Fuji: Microsoft's Cult of the Puzzle"" by William PoundstoneSpecifically for software developer interviews, this is also helpful:""Programming Interviews Exposed: Secrets to Landing Your Next Job"" by John MonganJust a hint: Canned answers seldom fool capable interviewers. Your time would be better spent mastering the actual techniques of problem solving, rather than trying to memorize things."
1,OVERSPRAY,"If u buy this unit, for your own sake, only use water clean up material, because you will be doin a lot of it. Unlike my othe HVLP system I use for Urathanes and fine finish, this unit gets material EVERYWHERE and mostly where you DON'T WANT IT........."
2,Below average for Paint,"This may work with stain but for paint is is SLOW, SLOW Slow, after two hours I gave up and used a roller and a brush, so much faster and easier."
1,;USELESS SPRAYER,THIS WAGNER CONTROL SPRAYER WAS THE MOST USELESS ITEM I HAVE EVER BOUGHT. IT DOESN'T WORK. IT RUINED MY PROJECT. ITS TOTALLY USELESS. I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND IT TO ANYONE WHO JUST TO SAVE SOME TIME WISHES TO PAINT ANYTHING. I ATTEMPTED TO USE IT ON A SIMPLE DOLL HOUSE AND IT WAS USELESS. THE SPRAY WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO CONTROL AND ADJUST. IT JUST SIMPLY WOULD NOT SPRAY WELL. JUNK JUNK JUNK.
2,Like other Wagner Products,"I figured out something that I might finally be able to use this thing for and darned if I didn't forget that I even owned it and used a $20 bug sprayer instead.Oh well, it does come in an easy to store box. I promise, if I ever buy another Wagner product I deserve whatever grief it brings me.These do make excellent items at your next garage sale though so there's something to smile about."
2,No Latex,If you intend to spray latex.. do not waste your time. It's good for spraying stains and that is about it...
1,Wagner HVLP control sprayer,"Clogs easily and not much spray coverage. For the the price, nota good buy. You are better off using spray cans."
4,Worked pretty well for me,"Compared to the Ryobi sprayer/roller I bought initially, this one worked like a dream. I diluted with water using almost a 50%/50% mixture. The paint comes out evenly, doesn't get paint all over the place and is easy to set up, clean and use. I did have the problem where I would bump into the piece I was painting while trying to get into the nooks and crannies but I suspect that would happen with a lot of the sprayers on the market. My one major complaint would be that it started to clog after awhile no matter what I did. I'd stop and clean it, run warm water through it, clear the nozzle etc. but within minutes it would be clogged again. This seemed to happen after using it for awhile but up until that point it worked great. I definitely recommend it for small projects (e.g. furniture, cabinets, etc.)."
1,BIG disappointment,"Performs nothing like what it advertises. It is very weak, and easily oversprays an area. If you use it indoors make sure you have EVERY other thing covered. If you don't, almost everything will be sprinkled with paint. I found this out and had to stop and do the paint job by hand. So I basically have it stored away forever now, never to be used again. I fully disagree with the High volume Low pressure that the product claims, as the volume it outputs is actually very low and ""sprinkly"" rather than a good solid ""wall of paint"" like those cheap spray paints in a can. You are better off using a paintbrush or roller, faster and better control."
5,Best Tool,"I just love the Wagner Control Spray. I bought it to spray my deck. It worked great. I stained my deck so fast that I tried it on my wooden lawn furniture and the same result, excellent coverage. I then used it on wrought iron again worked fantastic!Great tool, no overspray."
2,"Roller works just as fast, without the mess","I thought that I had selected the right product. I went to department stores and compared the items to this one. I thought that I was getting a good deal. This sprayer was about $10 cheaper, but as it turned out, it wasn't the same one that I had been comparing it to in the store. So, I spent the additional $84 and got the right one from the local store. With this sprayer you need to thin the mix, that is a pain. The only plus is that it is less of a mess than the $84 sprayer, and it does a great job in corners. If I had it to do over would I buy it, no!"
5,wagner hvlp,this power painter worked great i painted my car with ppg auto paint after 4 thin coats it came out looking great all i did was to thin the paint to the consisity required the painter works good if you follow the instructions
2,An expensive alternative to spray cans,"I bought this to spray colored stain but tried it out with oil based enamel paint first. Had to thin the enamel (rustoleum) 30-40% before it would spray properly. Yes, this works with thin materials close to the viscosity of water. Good finish, minimal overspray, easy application. Next I tried a latex stain. Even after it was thinned 50-60% it would not spray well. Totally useless for this material. Water clean up required a lot of scrubbing because the paint that gets in the air passages ends up being blow dried. I'm glad I have less than $55 into mine because its not worth the retail price. Buy spray cans instead, no clean up and less expensive."
1,NOT RECOMMENDED,Total garbage. Stain came out so uneven it would have looked better to have just thrown it out of the can and let it run down my fence. About the only good thing that came out of this purchase was Amazon's customer service. Returning it was quick and easy. Can't say enough good things about them.
2,I FEEL TRAPPED - Official Guide to Everything AuctionWatch,"This is a great propraganda book, with all roads leading back to AuctionWatch.com.As a novice auction seller, I felt that AuctionWatch was directing this book to me if I were a 7 year-old child. It has a couple helpful segments but is a full-blown ad for the AuctionWatch website.After reading it, well most of it anyway, I had to take a look for something a little more mature. I am still looking."
2,disappointing,"This publication consisted of 6 pages of large print. It was published by the public library of Somerville, Mass. in 1922. Although the age of the document may make it of some value the material in it was scanty and superficial."
5,Somebody is killing sickos...,"The guy, Monks is an ER physician and the woman is a shrink (Alison) in a psych ward, and theyre both damaged goods, but still good characters, so when the twisted business starts--somebody is killing sickos, and Alison finds out--yuo really matter what happens to them. The writing is lean and the ER scenes are EXCELLENT, the best Ive read. No this isn't a medical thriller, believe it or not--more like james Lee Burke. They should bring Monks back for another time, he's good."
2,Not for Me,"The would be good guys in this story were not all that interesting and/or good. The bad guys were NGI's (Not guilty by reason of insanity) and they were being released from their hospital back to an unsuspecting society. Phychologist, Alison Chapley, who works at the hospital heads back to an old lover for help in solving the mysterious disappearances of the inmates that have been released. The ex-lover, an emergency room doctor with his own problems is drawn back to Alison. Their original relationship was less than admirable. The reviews on this book were good; I seem to be the lone voice who didn't think much of it."
4,Quick and dirty,Good action read with another flawed hero. A promising writer. This one could go to the screen.
4,Triangle,I bought it for my band students and it works great! The percussion section has enjoyed using it while learning new music!
3,Good Start,This is a good Christian pop rock album. The strength here is the sincerity of the music and a vocalist who can carry this group a long way. Think Goo Goo Dolls with a Christian message and you'll be in the Overflow ballpark. At three stars this is an enjoyable album and gives the band room to grow on.
5,Niiiice...,"This cd is awesome! Maybe the guys that rated the cd so low were listening to the wrong one! All the songs are great and have made my walk with God all that more better. Everytime I see Overflow in concert I feel like God is speaking through them to me! They are such an amazing band and I know that God has a wonderful plan for this cd! And by the way, I just want to add the fact that these guys sing for one reason and that is to tell others about God. This cd has changed so many peoples lives already. God is definitely working through Overflow. So if anybody has a problem with the cd then maybe they should just leave it off the internet and not bring people down. That just seems like the Christian thing to do. Anyway, Keep on Rockin Overflow! I love you guys!God Bless!"
1,A Waste of Air Space,"Where is ""a better place?"" The answer: Any place that's far away from this CD. Why do groups with no talent think they can get some heavyweight producers to magically transform themselves? This band has no creativity within them. It's no wonder why the producers wrote most of the songs! Powell and Wilbanks simply threw up the same old tired noise that passes as ""music."" There is NOTHING original in these songs. This group represents the postmodern ideals of style over substance and appearance over reality. Their lyrics are shallow and reflect as much theological insight and understanding as a moderate political candidate! Overflow gives Christianity a bad name and promotes the simple and stupid stereotype of that faith. The road to destruction is paved with good intentions. ""A Better Place"" is just more asphalt."
4,Sweet Drill at certain prices,"bought this when it was on amazon for 71 dollars, for the whole set. ive loved it since then, the saw can rip and cut pretty much anything, tho u do need a guide. the drill has a lot of torque, and does tend to twist in the hand on higher speeds, as it is very compact. ive dropped it twice, no damage that i can tell. the lantern is less useful than a spotlight, but nobody buys this package for the lantern. all in all, i gave it 4 stars, the only problem ive had is a tendency to strip screws rather easily, but thats probably the bit im using..."
5,Tea for me,"I love this tea and have a mug full each morning to start my day with. Not bitter, not overpowering, not weak either. Add a little bit of honey and you are in for a treat."
2,Roasty Taste But Too Weak,"To be fair, I like the roasty taste of this tea. However, it really isn't as strong as I like it to be. I had to use 3 teabags to get the strength of (what I usually get for) 1 teabag. Which makes this product quite expensive."
4,A disappointing follow up to the 'Original'!,"Jerald has an awesome talent of creating this music. His first album (1995)was better than this one. Every song was powerful, the whole album flowed together, was beautiful. This album however, loses that magic. It is too 'R&B' for me. The vocals came across weakly, beats were confusing, sporatic. If you have the first album, then know this 2nd album is nothing like it. I meant to give it only 2 stars."
1,Nice drive--until it quit,"It was a beautiful concept--stick 40GB onto your laptop, no power cord attached. But it only lasted a few weeks before it quit, and I was unable to get hold of their tech support people. No need anyway. It just clicks. Save yourself some trouble and just throw your money out the window instead of buying this drive."
3,An Okay Book.,"Somewhere between the terrible reviews and the great reviews lies the truth. This book was not terrible, but it wasn't amazing either. If you loved it, I can understand. If you hated it like no other, well, I guess I can understand that too."
2,RIDICULOUS,"It breaks my heart to give Edward 2 stars, but this book just didn't cut it. I felt him holding back in scene after scene. At lot of promises but very little payoff. I'm a big fan of his work and found this to be his tamest novel to date. I realize the author was hospitalized around the time he wrote this, so maybe that had something to do with it, but I was disappointed nonetheless. If you want a real dose of Ed Lee's magic and imagination, read ""City Infernal"". Or, for a truly gut-wrentching experience, read ""The Chosen""."
2,BORING! gore fest wasn't what I expected with Lee,"Man was I dissapointed with this book. To be honest I only got halfway through but had to put it down due to the lack of suspense, scare factor, plotline etc. Most of the beginning of the book focuses on a security officer who is adjusting to her new job. For some reason that doesn't scream scary story to me. I found it so difficult to read through boring paragraph after paragraph that I finally said enough is enough and put this book down. I expected so much more from this author as alot of people praise his work. This is the first book of Lee's that I've read and will likely give him one more chance but...I hear his other book Creepers (out of print) is really good. If you want to read a scary and very gripping book try Masterton's ""The House that Jack Built""."
2,Um...No.,"Edward Lee is one of my favorite horror authors. I had just finished ""Flesh Gothic"" and was looking forward to the same chills and stomach-turning images in ""Monstrosity"". Unfortunately, I spent the majority of my time flipping through the pages thinking, ""What the *%^$ is going on?"" and then when all was revealed - let's just say the ending was a major letdown. Definitely not your typical Edward Lee.I gave it two stars because the side bits with the 'necks and other minor characters were rather good. Mutant roaches? Giant eels? Loved it! Too bad the rest of the story flopped.Needless to say, this will not keep me from reading another Edward Lee novel."
2,A Lesser Attempt,"I am generally a fan of the works of Edward Lee (see review of ""Flesh Gothic""). However, for me this one fell a bit flat. I am unclear about the order in which his works were released, but in this novel he almost seems to be trying to market it as pornography with a nod to horror, instead of the other way around; many of the scenes are explicit with no real reason for their inclusion, and the overarching plot seems a watered-down version of a long series of better works, with the sex spin added for apparent shock value, not because it actually added anything to the plot. This book was disappointing if you like Lee."
2,Definiately Rated R,"I decided to give Edward Lee a chance, I'm not much of a horror reader- I prefer the movies. However, I found alot of unnecessary sex/rape scenes, I could have done without that. I'm sure Edward Lee could have come up with a more creative and less obscene way to describe his scenes and still be scary. Overall the rest of the story was entertaining, there was always something lurking around or something questionable going on, it was hard to put this book down- I read it in two days, it was very suspenseful. I would probably read Edward Lee's next book, but if the rape and sex scenes are even more than they were in this book, it will probably be the last I read from him."
1,Truly a Monstrosity,"This bok was jsut plain BAD. Graphic violence and gore are acceptabel IF the story's good, and it furthers the story. However, the gore and violence in Lee's book does neither. THe plot is threadbare and contrived, and the surprise ending seems to be tacked on - an ""oh, by the way, here's how this all fits together"" - There are also gaping logic ""holes"" in the story, and macguffins that leave the reader frustrated. I'm willing to suspend disbelief in horror, but not at the expense of how a rational person would or could be expected to react.Lee's writing style is quick and easy to read, and pacing is good - the talent's there, just not the creativity and ability to ""scare""."
2,Sloppy and seemed to have been written way too fast,"As a fan of extreme horror, I was looking forward to this book after I picked it up and read the jacket blurbs. I was disappointed, alas. There were some genuinely creepy moments, but it didn't hang together, either plotwise or logically. There were so many unbelievable coincidences and inexplicable motivations and cliched characters and situations, I just couldn't suspend my disbelief. The ending was so rushed and predictable, it was hard to care who was killing who. This was the first Edward Lee novel I'd read; he has a good reputation, so I plan to give him a chance and try one more of his works before writing him off as a semi-hack. But based on this one book, I'll take Bentley Little, Graham Masterton, or Stephen King any day of the week."
1,Is the author twelve years old or something?,This is one of those books that I wanted to like based on the hype surrounding it and the author. I regret that I was sorely disapointed. The novel has plenty of poorly written sex and rape scenes that are punctuated by gore that fails to ever be frightening or even establish the slightest bit of suspense. Even the blurb on the inside cover is dull and unconvincing.In the end Ed Lee writes like a twelve year trying to gross out his friends. This would be ok if only characterization and the art of story telling don't get in the way.Sorry Charley
3,Check it out from the library,"Well, I just finished Monstrosity...it was good, but not great. The beginning of the book started off strong, but about halfway through it faltered a bit for me. I felt like the author kind of stumbled his way through the story to reach the (*eyeroll*) predictable ending. There were a few editing mistakes, but they weren't major.One thing that bummed me out more than anything else was I think the cover and the synopsis is a bit misleading. The cover shows these four hideous looking monsters emerging from the woods. Where were these four monsters in the story? I only found one. The stalking of Clare in the synopsis doesn't ring quite true either.Although I didn't love this novel, I will be reading more of Lee in the future. If you decide you want to give this book a go, I would suggest getting it from the library instead of buying it.*Book Hollow"
4,Good book with a great ending,"Monstrosity is a page turning horror novel. I thought that all the characters were well developed, and the story was very original. You wont get bored with this book, I can promise you that.The last 20 pages has the be the best part though. The twist at the end will blow your mind.Lee does it again. He is really proving that he is the most hard-core horror writer out there"
4,Main stream Lee,"Good book. This is a pretty tame book for the king of sick, the one and only Edward Lee. Monstrosity is more like a B-movie put out by a man that also makes block-buster movies. Monstrosity is much tamer than most of Lee's stuff and a good starting point for the main stream to read Lee. This is a fun read with monsters and mad scientists, sex and some gore (this is Lee after all). Unless you are a collector I would go for the paperback, although Cemetery Dance doe's a great job with the hard cover"
5,"dark, sexy, and above all...deep bliss.","currently, the deep house thing is taking the the dance music world by storm. despite this release not being mixed, the tracks featured here are absolutely perfect. be sure to check out when i fall in love by a:xis (track 9-cd1). do yourself a favor and pick this up asap. wonderful artwork. be aware....deeper 2 is now out also. however, it isn't necessarily anything like this release...it's more trancey and in your face. whereas, everything on this release is very subtle and hot!!"
4,exceptional,"this recorded concert dvd is an exceptional item for any benatar fan. you get all the great benatar classic, and four new songs from thier new abulm, coming soon.highlights are live for love, we belong, out of the ruins, and girl. pure magic, pure benatar. if you like this concert, get the soundtrack for this concert on cd as well. the introduction by pat is somewhat funny as pat mentions the fact that their recording this for histoic reasons, and they never did a dvd before. i wonder why? they were not available in the eighities!!!. great performance, and benatar looks beautiful, and stunning. all the more."
5,2 chicks from Australia love AAR,"Coming from Australia and seeing your favourite band in their home country is pretty exciting stuff. Throw in some home made t-shirts and a kind security guard who lets you know when the band is about to appear on the back stage near you, and you have an amazing night. Imagine being told that this concert was being filmed for a DVD..... well, that's what happened to my beautiful cousin and I. We are from Brisbane, Australia and we were at the Twin Cities gig in December. From personal experience, this show is amazing. If you love AAR, you will love this :)"
5,Good Concert,I'm from Brazil and The All Americans Rejects is my favorite band. This concert is really amazing!!
3,Not bad. Not amazing,"I picked up this book with the hope that it would share some insight into why i-mode was such a big success. It did that only.This is an extremely 'business/management' style of book. Full of hullabaloo, simple to read and gets somewhat preachy at times.However I did enjoy reading it, although I sometimes doubt validity of some speculations made (Such as Singapore eradicating paper and coin based money entirely by the year 2008).I'll give it 3 stars because it did give me the answer I was looking for but it wasn't a life changing experience reading it. Sorry."
1,Save your money and time!,"Very disappointing. 98% presentation and 2% substance. If this were a term paper in a business school, I'd give it C--- (triple minus). Who am I to judge? Well it almost made me wanna write my own version of what DoCoMo is, and how it reached the position it is today.A little more detail. There's almost no info on the technical aspect of i-mode, except that it is packet-switching and runs on PDC. The authors attributed the success mainly to the management team. That's where they miss the point. After reading the book, you would still have no clue why i-mode succeeded in Japan, but has yet to dominate in other world regions.I would give it 0 star. Amazon doesn't allow me."
1,Superficial and useless analysis,"John C. Beck, Mitchell E. Wade clearly do not know and understand the critical factors and strategy behind Ntt DoCoMo's i-mode. Most of the book is so superficial and general to be useless. Most of the intereting elements of Ntt DoCoMo strategy are not covered here so buy something else instead of wasting your money on this."
4,I thought it was good,I really enjoyed reading about Choo's time with the Lord. I read some parts to my 6th grade class and they were moved by her testimony. You must read with an open mind and know that time is short and the Lord is coming back and we need to be ready for His return and tell others. You must read it.
5,An Inspired and inspiring book,This book has changed my life. I now know what God has prepared for us and I'm more motivated than ever to live according to the Bible. God Bless.
1,Disappointed,"I bought this book having high hopes for it. I have been a Christian all of my life and i have read the Mark K Baxter books which i loved.I couldn't read the whole book because of the things she writes about.What i did read in the book she did not once mention how important it is to accept Christ. If i was not a believer i wouldn't know how to pray the Lord's prayer and not once did she mention prayer.In the chapter ""A Place Called Hell"" pg 45 it reads ""the Lord led me to a differrent area outside the gates of the Kingdom we continued to ascend the mountain...when we reached the summit and i looked over the crest of the mountain i could see fumes and dark smoke rising from the deep pit."" According to this lady Hell is higher than Heaven which i disagree. I Guess you have to have an open mind but if that goes against what the Bible says i don't want nothing to do with it!!"
2,Misleading Book,"I do not recommend this book. Misleading. There are better books out there on Heaven. Read those. This book doesn't contain factual truth. The seller is upset, because I gave a 2 rating. Actually, I was being generous."
1,Heaven is so real? Choo Thomas,"A friend gave me this book saying that it blessed her. I read part of it and cannot go on, all it did was give me a nosebleed and a headache. Where is Jesus in this book? It is a book of condemnation and self exaltation.Ephesians 2:8-9Amplified Bible (AMP)8For it is by free grace (God's unmerited favor) that you are saved ([a]delivered from judgment and made partakers of Christ's salvation) through [your] faith. And this [salvation] is not of yourselves [of your own doing, it came not through your own striving], but it is the gift of God;9Not because of works [not the fulfillment of the Law's demands], lest any man should boast. [It is not the result of what anyone can possibly do, so no one can pride himself in it or take glory to himself.]"
1,yuck,"I accidently deleted my original review so I have no pages to quote as I discarded the book. I would say this is the worst book I have ever read. There is nothing remotely scriptural about her experience - just creepy and downright demonic. PLEASE don't believe this book-recognize the Bible as the final word -you don't need someone's subjective experience about heaven/hell. The Bible tells it all. There is nothing new here in this book about future events. The 66 books of the Bible tells it all. If you are searching for the truth, it is not found in Choo's story."
5,Heaven is so real is a great book.,"This book is a wonderful account of one who the Lord took up into heaven on numerous occasions. He showed her around heaven, gove her a glimpse of hell and spent much time preparing her for her ministry. I hope you are blessed by reading this book as I was."
2,Tedious,"Couldn't stay gripped to it. Found a lot of it unbelievable, Contradicted by most of what I know of Christianity. Very tedious and repetitive style."
1,"Lies, full of lies.","The mass appeal of this book is a sign that United States is infested with christian fundamentalism. Naive and ignorant believers want to see the heaven that reflect their earthy desires. I firmly believe that Choo Thomas is a swindler who knows how to profit on faith and fear of the ignorant christian mass. It is pretty obvious that the whole book is full of lies and deceptions that don't need to be spiritually fueled. I guess Choo Thomas did her homework analyzing the bible and believer's mindset. Just like Mary K. Baxter and Sylvia Browne, Choo Thomas is just another scammer who knows how to rip off fearful and uneducated christian fundamentalists."
1,Beware,"I would urge any and all who are looking for a divine revelation about heaven to pass on this book and go straight to the Bible. There are many,many things said in this book which do not line up with the word of God...please, be wary. God has much to say about heaven in the bible. If you are looking for a book to help you understand exactly what the Bible says about heaven...forget this one and buy the book Heaven by Randy Alcorn. It will bless you...if you still are not convinced...do some homework on the internet about this writer before you buy this book."
1,Not Biblical.,"I too read this book. I saved it to read on vacation, I was looking forward to reading it. At first I was enjoying it, the more I read the worse I felt. There are several things that made me feel bad, but I think the most troubling was that a lot of the statements could not be backed by the Bible. I will mention one. When she said Jesus dressed up special for his birthday on Dec. 25. I know the real Jesus knows when His birthday is and we all know it is not Dec. 25. This day was chosen by Constantine's mother, who was a pagan worshiper. She knew this was the date that most pagan worshiper use as there god's birthday, Dec. 25th. Just as what we call Easter is named after the pagan goddess of fertility, Eostre. That is where all the bunny and egg stuff comes from."
1,False Jesus,"I prayed for discernment before reading this book. By the time I got to page 21, I'd had enough. I only continued to read so I could warn the friend who loaned me the book that this was false prophecy. Kinda felt dirty just reading it! Especially the ""body work"" section.Choo Thomas has been deceived. The lord in this book is not Jesus Christ. This is blatant trickery by Satan. He wants the reader to believe that the Grace of God is revocable, that works are the ticket into Heaven and that The Holy Bible is untrue and incomplete. We need to pray for this poor woman.God bless you."
1,Faith not works,This book seems to stress that we are saved by works. The real Jesus saves by faith in him and not by works. I believe she was visited by an evil spirit masquerading as Jesus. I believe in the Jesus of the New Testament. I pray for her.
1,Sounds like a book for space cadet,"In the words of Kenneth Hagin..bless her darling heart and stupid head..This is what people will write when they don't spend time in understanding first the Word of righteousness and gets too spiritual and caught up with self all the time..as a result, they don't enter into the Rest..the peace of heart. They are still trying to obey, trying very hard to please God which is an abomination.These book leads people astray.. putting alot of emphasis on self effort and will worhsip and not knowing and understanding Jesus's finished work..and our right and perfect standing in Him..funny how some can rate this highly when Jesus says that anyone who depends on self effort is cursed.. ( meaning life on earth is tough)"
5,Heaven is So Real,Amazon service cannot be beaten! This book is one of the best books I've ever read! Life changing...
5,Every one should read it,This is a road map to follow if you want to get into Heaven. Follow it and you will have happiness for all eternity in Heaven. Ignore it and end up in Hell.
4,Heaven is so Real,This was a good read. An eye opener to the world that awaits us one day. It stresses the fact that time is running out.
1,Heaven is Real by Choo Thomas,"""I just recently read Mrs. Thomas book ""Heaven is Real"" and would like to ask anyone who reads it to always remember that only God's written Word is infallible."" Christian's must always use Discernment when anyone prophesy's about an future events, whether it's personal or for others."" It's better to pray and be on guard than to believe blindly and be spiritually infected."""
1,Confused and Scared,"I am a devout Christian who just finished reading this book. Up until this point, I have always been secure in my salvation- knowing that by loving the Lord and believing in the life, death and resurrection of Jesus I would be in heaven. This book scared me on so many levels. It challenges all I have learned and, for the most part, I can find no Biblical evidence to back up Mrs. Choo's statements. I am going to pray about this, but I honestly wish I had never read this book."
3,I hope the first review written by Rightwinger is a joke.,"I am pretty sure Rightwinger is being very sarcastic is writing that he now knows how to get to heaven because of works he has learned by reading this book. Yes, Im pretty sure he is being very sarcastic."
2,The Bible clearly states that our glorify bodies will not need to be fed,When in doubt only trust the Bible. The Bible clearly states that in our glorify bodies will not need to be fed as well as any sexual preference.Even if in this book there is nothing that will make one do bad things there are some things that don't add up. I only hope that indeed this book was inspired by the Lord himself. The Lord is not something one should play with and if it was something that deceived her may the Lord watch over her. I don't think that the Lord Jesus will make one feel fear but Love.
1,To much about her...,I started reading this book last night...I had no peace and fell a sleep with fear in my heart....My thoughts were as I read... There is sure alot in here about why God is using her... She's just so good in Gods eyes...All peoples righteouness is as filthy rages before God......Nobody stands before God as good enough to be used to get anything...Seemed a little puffed up in my eyes... But I might be wrong.....Something just isn't settling with me when I read this.... I just read 23 minutes in Hell and I felt this man was right on..... And she talkes about Hell in this book as he did... I don't think she is trying to led anybody astray in any way..... In my spirit I am not convinced...!!!
1,Deceived,"Save your money. Read the BIBLE. satan possesses the ability to transform his appearance into that of an angel of light. While Choo Nam may have had multiple encounters with a spirit being, clearly that being was NOT the Lamb of God. Furthermore, it doesn't sound as though she has ever heard the true Gospel of Jesus Christ, as she keeps promoting the idea that entrance into heaven is contingent upon works. The God of Heaven has NO interest in making human beings ""famous"", which is what Choo Nam claims was promised her. This fame is the customary promise of the devil. And lastly, Jesus blood purchased a bride, not children. SAVE YOUR MONEY. If you want to know about heaven, read Betty Malz' ""My Glimpse of Eternity"" or ""Close Encounters of the God Kind"" by Jesse DuPlantis."
1,Heaven is so Real,I enjoyed parts of this but questioned the whole relationship with Jesus in some of these contexts. It didn't seem to go along with scripture. I believe the Lord speaks but appearing every day I questioned. I also questioned the constant preparing of Ms. Choo....I thought the Holy Spirit did that in today's time????I hope I'm wrong!
1,I think this book is a sham.,I wasn't too sure about this book until I read about her and Jesus catching and cooking a fish in heaven. There is no death in heaven - not even for a fish! Then I knew she was making things up.
1,big lie,"I cannot recommend this book. I believe that the author made up the whole thing just to sell books on a popular title. What she says just doesn't have the ring of truth to me. Her descriptions of heaven as a place of empty buildings waiting to be peopled, is not the way that I think of heaven. Where are all the blessed people in heaven?"
1,Just a bit too weird for my taste!,"I ran it by my pastor too and it seemed like there were too many ""religious"" actions she had to go through and heaven didn't ""feel right when I read about it. I don't recommend this at all. Read Rebecca Springer's book if you want the real thing!!"
5,Very Impressive.,This book is a very informative guide for students as well as professionals. Very interesting for me as i am a nail tech in Australia and like to know about the standards around the world. The Chapter on nail art is very involved and has some amazing pics. I am very happy i bought this book!!
4,Sony dvp-fx1 9/01,"I had just purchased this tiny piece of electronic wizardry from sony. after playing it for awhile, i found a few things that could have made this machine nicer, lets start with sound quality, it could have been better. 2 earphone jacks would have been nice. the brightness switch doesn't seem to change the picture too much, after all, it is sony's first attempt at a portable dvd w/monitor. so we all know they'll improve in all aspects of this machine. one last note. It was quite pricey...."
5,"Great story, good lesson, fun read!","This is such a great book for little ones. My 3 year old has enjoyed this book for quite some time now. There is a good lesson for Daisy (and your little ones) in that she learns not to wander from Mama Duck; something little 1-3 year olds are often learning themselves. The illustrations are lovely, and draw in the reader. My daughter is very interested in how things work out for little Daisy. I have even been called ""Mama Duck"" from time to time when she is snuggling up close, an endearing nickname my daughter picked up from this book. Very cute.Jane Simmons has a way of keeping her stories simple enough for the little ones, yet interesting enough for the reader to read again and again. Nice work!"
5,"If you parent or teach a gifted girl, you need this book!","This book was an eye-opener to me about my daughters and about myself. I bought it to help with my daughters, bu the way Barbara Kerr writes has spoken to my soul, and helped me understand myself."
1,WEGA IS WEAK!,"I bought this TV a year ago & it's been nothing but a headache! The picture keeps pulling in & out or it shrinks in size to a 15"" picture in the center of the tube! I've had it repaired 3 TIMES in one year! Sony tech is weak! They have replaced the entire circuit boards & video cards that project image to corners of flat screen & it still freaks out! SOUND is weak...you have to add stereo speakers with BASS since the tiny speakers do NOT deliver deep tones no matter how you adjust it...LOOKS COOL BUT DON'T BE FOOLED!"
4,Flat screen is worth the price,"We recently bought the first tv we had bought in ten years. The first time we saw this tv, we thought that the flat screen was cool, then thought that the silver sides were distracting. The next time, we weren't that impressed at all. The third, time, still being drawn to the tv, we thought we would investigate more. The flat screen really is cool; there is a lot less distortion. However, the silver of the set can be distracting. We mostly watch movies at night, and you don't notice when the lights are out. What put us over the edge on the tv however, was the 16:9 ratio.Again, we watch mostly movies, and the flat screen combined with the 16:9 ratio was a draw. The only drawback, again, is the silver color of the tv. Also, do not be tempt to pay more for the FV model. The primary difference is the location of the speakers (you can have surround sound with the FV model). However, by attaching speaker to this model, you get the same effect, but better, and for less money."
1,Flimsy and cheap,"I admit I stuff a lot of laundry in my hamper before I wash it all. But the very first time I carried this hamper from my apartment to the building washer/dryer machines... One of the handles broke. The wire frame bent. And the plastic supports popped out. This hamper may be fine using it like the picture shows (half full at most) but fill it up with clothes and the strain is simply too much. The stitching, the assembly, the frame material are all... simply put... cheap. Rather than waste anymore money on these mesh/wire hampers, I'm going to invest in a couple durable cotton ones with seams that won't split so easily."
3,Does the job,"Does the job, nice and big. Maybe a little too big if you plan to carry it around a lot."
5,The Simplest Way for Stereo Recording,"I really did agree about the quality of this preamp, I connected pair of Audio-Technica ATR97 Omnidirectional Condenser and it did power them adequately even better quality than the noisy one on creative X-Fi sound card.If you are looking for the easiest step to create high quality stereo home recording definitely go with this Preamp."
4,Jammin' blues,"I listened to the first couple of songs at a listening booth at Tower Records and was instantly hooked. I bought the CD and it hasn't left the player since. Like Robert Cray, Bernard Allison melds a number of musical styles into his blues playing, but while Cray leans toward r&b and soul, Allison is more into rock and funk. The result is a jammin' CD that will have you tapping your toes. As a point of reference, my favorite artists are Cray, Keb Mo, Eric Bibb and, to a somewhat lesser extent, Eric Clapton and Kenny Wayne Shepherd. Bernard Allison is right at home with this group, and I plan to check out more of his CDs."
5,The best in Australian blues,"This album is a prime example of blues, influenced by the mississippi delta, but with an Australian flavour. Even has Rob Hirst from Midnight Oil in the band. Killer. Check the websitewww.backsliders.com.au"
2,Only written for the wealthy?,"Books and magazines frequently choose wealthier homes to show pics of staging. Don't authors realize a lot of us live in apartments, condos, mobile homes and the like? Why purchase a book/magazine if it doesn't fit my life style?"
1,Only Ads...,Don't buy. Read the review about all the people who work for the author who have been 'reviewing' it. It is a waste of time and money if you have an once of common sense.
1,Dont waste your time or money,"This book was dreadful. More than half of the book was the author telling you over and over and over again how she is the creator of home staging. Content wise, there is very little that you dont already know. There are very few before and after photos and non would be judged to be good example of good furniture placement or design. I would suggest ""Dress your house for Success"" or ""Using What you have Decorating""."
1,Not a fan,I didn't get a lot out of this book. The language used annoyed me. The decorating style shown in the photos was outdated. In some cases I could not even tell which was supposed to show the more appealing room.
5,Home Staging: The Winning Way to Sell Your House for More Money,This is an important book about Staging by the person who first created the concept and has worked with 1000's of homeowners to perfect her ideas and techniques. Homes that are Staged really do sell faster and/or for more money! Barb's concepts work and can be used for any home in any price range. One of the best things about Staging is that it normally costs very little to prepare a home for sale using existing furniture and accessories. This book has all of the how to's as well as checklists and lots of great full color before and after photos.
5,Buy this book.,"Before I wrote this review, I read what some others had to say and was apalled by the negative and sometimes downright mean comments. Why are they so afraid of this very smart and successful woman? The content of this book is very helpful for someone who is serious about getting their home sold quickly and for the highest possible price. The Table of Contents shows how well the author has thought out what questions a seller might have about how to get their home ready to sell and what to do first. The suggestions are practical and fun. The author thinks outside the box and not only offers simple and beautiful solutions, but provides some excellent before and after pictures. If you want to know what the fine art of staging is all about, buy this book."
1,Useless bit of self-promotion by Barb Schwarz - a waste of money,"This book tells you what you already knew - clean, declutter, fix broken stuff, and clean up the yard. That's about it. The reason the book is more than ten pages long is that it is chock full of the author's stories about how wonderful she is and what a staging pioneer she is. I really wish I hadn't wasted my money on this fluffy piece of advertising."
3,Decent book,"This book has some good thoughts and ideas as well as suggestions on staging your home for sale. Some of the ideas are pretty basic and commonsense and some are very good. However, the author comes across as being a real braggart throughout the entire book taking credit for just about everything and not letting you forget it. I think the book could be better if she check her ego at the door and just stick to the subject."
1,Buyers will be disappointed...,"If you're about to put your house on the market, you have a million things to do. Don't take time out to read this book. The amount of truly useful information fills about ten pages, and can be found on various internet web sites with a simple search. The rest is repetitious, contradictory, and/or silly.The biggest waste of time is reading personal information about her own home and the off-topic ""staging for living"" concept. Also annoying are continual plugs for her organization, profession, and services. (Obviously, home staging makes sense, and is worth the effort. We wouldn't have bought the book otherwise. Why must she remind us over and over?)Spend your time decluttering, instead."
1,"For Shame, For Shame","The title should be ""How to Shamelessly Market and Promote Your Business!"" But I blame myself. I skimmed it and, even though I saw through all of the self-congratulatory hot air, I called in one of the women that Schwarz trained. I should have quit while I was ahead but I was in a rush to put my house on the market. Instead of the great looking home I was hoping for I wound up with a ridiculously cutsey-cutsey family room, dining room and foyer and a huge bill for all of the rentals and props the stager brought in that I thought my realtor was going to pay for!!! Had the book actually taught me something I would not have fallen into this trap and had a huge argument with my broker. No sour grapes but there are other books that I found, like Home Therapy and Use What You Have Decorating, that are way better and actually helped me do it myself before my open house."
1,Save Your Money,"Nothing solid or specific. Half of the book is filled with fluff on ASP (isn't this a snake?) stories which don't relate to my needs as a home seller but only serve to boost her own company. Lists a few obvious inexpensive ways to decorate (most of which I found cheap and distasteful). Was very surprised that the ""founder"" of home staging had so little useful information to pass along. Save your money or buy ""Dressed for Success"" which was far more useful."
3,"Good playing, bad production decisions","Thomas Rajna completed his cycle of Granados's solo piano music within a year - 1976. As if to celebrate the thirtieth anniversary of their original appearance on CRD LPs Brilliant Classics has returned the cycle to the market-place. It's in one slim box containing six nicely filled CDs and with extensive notes from Bryce Morrison.Very bad production decisions, however, flaw this set because many of the pieces are not separately tracked. For instance, neither the six pieces comprising the Escenas Romanicas nor the six pieces comprising Seis Piezas are separately tracked. In fact, there are only 59 tracks across the 6 CDs, when there should be about 105 tracks when compared to the way the pieces should have been tracked. So if you're bothered by this as much as I am or are a piano student needing to study these pieces separately, then opt for the excellent, similarly-priced Martin Jones set which is correctly divided into separate tracks for each piece."
2,Not what you may think!,"The cover sets-up expectations that may not be met in the movie itself. The movie drags and the acting is not up to Western standards. If you are seeking nudity, you may be disappointed. Although there is some in the movie, I had the impression that the producers saw more than the viewers see. You may want to rent this movie rather than purchase it...but this is just my opinion."
2,A Woman of Substance Trilogy,disc #1 was wonderful ... I started disc #2 the same night and was THOROUGHLY DISAPPOINTED.... this #2 started out about 30 yrs ahead.. There was ABSOLUTELY NOTHING ON THE DISC ABOUT EMMA'S LOVER PAUL AND THEY STORY TOGETHER... i watched #3 just because I had it... I WROTE TO THE AUTHOR MRS BRADFORD AND THE COMPANY THAT MADE THE CD... I WANTED A REFUND.... If there is a complete disc 2 out there I never saw it :(
3,woman of substance,"Not quite as good as I expected. Perhaps it was because I had read the book, it didn't quite live up to my expectation. However, it was better than any currently produced movies."
3,A bit disappointed,"After reading the reviews, I thought this sounded like an enjoyable trilogy - a 'rags to riches' story, which can sometimes be enjoyable.I found the overall negativity - while probably very true to human nature - unappealing. Too much vengence, too much hate, and no real happy moments to balance.It was more a story about a woman who gave up 'living' to prove she was as good as those she hated, than someone who overcame all odds to make a place for herself and her children in a world dominated (at the time she began) by men. She becomes just as ruthless and uncaring as the ones she's trying to prove her worth to, simply 'proving' to the viewer that you can't win by being a different type of person than the 'examples' you have been shown.Maybe I'm too Pollyanna, but I feel we can all WIN, and still stay true to our values - we don't have to become even worse than those we see around us who have apparently succeeded - if only by amassing a lot of money."
5,Love Barbara Taylor Bradford,"Loved the DVD. I started with A woman of Substance and read all of her books thru all the children, and how they carried on her business. Really enjoyed every book she has written."
3,Up and Down,"A Woman of Substance DVD - Excellent!Hold the Dream DVD - picture quality not a good as the first one.To Be The Best DVD - totally different-different cast, story lineI'm glad I bought the trilogy."
2,Woman of Substance Trilogy,"I wanted more of an English setting, like Downton Abby. Just not what I wanted. I should have read the reviews."
4,Good escapism and a touch of gossipy rubbish,"Typical implausable story, with a touch of class and a streak of vengeance. The first three discs are pretty good, but the fourth one switches actresses and it becomes difficult to keep up with the characters. Good watch for a wet afternoon."
5,Women of Substance,Best Movie I Ever Watched .....Every Women Would Enjoy This OneYou Won't Be Disappointed......Worth Every Penny You Paid For It.
5,Excellent Product,"This kind of memories are the best, now i'm running my computer very fast, everything is very faster. Now I can run many programs without any trouble"
5,What you see is not what you get,"There is nothing wrong with the actual product. Just beware that the picture does not represent the actual product. The picture is of DDR3 not the advertised ram 184pin DDR 400MHz. However the ordered ram was correct by the text description.Somehow there ended up being two of these in my cart instead of one and I did not catch the discrepancy until the package arrived. I have ordered products from Amazon.com for many years and this is the first problem I've ever had. They do not consider this to be a refundable excuse even if the package is unopened and returned. With all that said the ram is actually in good working order and performs as it should. (the package I opened was, as far as the second one, I never opened it. Now I'm stuck with it. Lesson learned)"
4,Used it for a long time now,"I usually go back and forth between Corsair and Kingston, but I like the heat spreaders on my memory. To S. Baker, if you read this and still have your memory I will buy it from you. (ostmark212 at yahoo.com)"
1,dont get it from amazon,"ordered it on Oct. 21 received it on Nov. 4..... after waiting that long to get it, i just want to open up the box and put the memory in my computer, but no i opened up the box and the memory package looks like it was cut open by someone or used and returned now i have to return and its going to take them like a month to return the money back to my credit card. DO NOT BUY FROM AMAZON!!!!! just go to best buy and get it. you get what you pay for......"
2,Pride of Africa,"After having abuse a client, a hunter loses his job of guide in the African jungle. Then he finds a job in a luxury train named ""Pride of Africa"" as a security chief.Comments:I think this film was a pilot for a new tv series, and I think this is the only one. Too bad! Robert was good in this part! The idea wasn't so bad (you agree with me that nowadays most of the tv series are so stupid!). But I have to recognize that a weakly point on this film was the cast: you can't put Robert with bad actors!He's marvelous as a hunter so kind and human. In this pilot you have four stories about the passengers of the train. What I learnt here is that a woman can throw a man out of a train! and the man can survive and claim revenge! ha ha. And I also learnt that the same woman can prefer Robert to his young husband, well, that's not fiction, he's so handsome!"
4,A Living Dinosaur: In Search of Mokele-Mbembe,"I read the book, and I liked it because Dr. Mackal is very conservative scientist, and he has lots of courage. He just looked at eye-witnesses and weighted the evidence. He never saw a Dinosaur, but he took careful notes from People in the Congo who said they saw one. He documents eye witnesses and other stories starting in the 17th century when Jesuits who were some the first Europeans who visited there. It was an interesting read. I bought the book straight from Dr. Mackal at the University of Chicago."
5,SO FAST!!,I bought this universal reader from Micro Center because it was on sale. I actually didn't even think it would work because it was a brand I hadn't heard of. HOWEVER. I am using Windows XP Pro and it works FANTASTIC!! I used to use my HP Photosmart printer to upload pictures and it would take FOREVER. This card reader opens my SmartMedia disk in seconds. Incredibly easy to install and an overall great product!!
3,seanofdesign.com,"This media card reader does live up to all the good reviews it's gotten. The download time is fast and the usability/reliability is sound. The one drawback to this model is that it is a little too big and heavy.This reader is great if:1. You actually need to use more than just a compact flash or smartmedia card reader: this reader is also equipped to handle Memory Sticks, Secure Digital, MultiMediaCards, and IBM Microdrives.2. You're planning on using this reader for your desktop and not a laptop.This card may not be the best choice if you plan to travel (or just go mobile with your laptop) based on its size and weight."
2,tedious!,"looks great but my user experience has been tedious! i am using this reader with windows 2000 and standard CF cards from Lexar. when i insert the card the reader wont read it first time around, i typically have to take it out and insert the card a 2nd or even 3rd time before i get access to the data on the card. which means i have to pick the thing up and work the card in and out, it doesnt sit peacefully on my desk where i expected it would. no fun! works fine once i get it to acknowlege the card is in the slot. i am looking for a replacement!"
1,This is where I stopped reading.,"Anthony's series was going good until the main charater and the horsegirl started having sex constantly. I could't help but get disgusted at the repetitive passages of sexual acts because this girl ""coudln't get enough"". I thought the entire thing childish, as though fantasies were being played out instead of a story. After a few passages of that I got fed up and stopped. Perhaps the book got better as it went on, so read if you will-but you must get past the passages where the author appeared to be horny."
2,Another series gets worn out.,"Too many authors try to push their series of books beyond where they were originally intended to end (I think it's something like the rule that movie sequels almost never match up to the original). This is another one. The first 3 books are a fun read, very worthwhile mixture of hard SF and fantasy. This one goes way downhill. I'm not sure I can put my finger on it; the ideas just seem worn out. I also tried to read one or two more books in the series. They were no better and I gave up the effort there. I recommend that you read the first three books in this series and then call it quits."
4,A pretty good beginning to the story of Mach and Bane.,"This one was pretty good. After twenty years of no communication or anything between the frames of Phaze and Proton, Stile's son, Bane, makes contact with Blue's son, Mach, and they switch bodies so that they're both in each others frames in the other's body.Then Bane falls in love with Agape from Proton and Mach falls in love with Fleta from Phaze and a bunch of problems arise.I enjoyed this book."
5,Try it and get hooked...,"This was my very first Science Fiction/Fantasy book. I picked this book up when I was 14 because the cover caught my attention, and I haven't stopped reading Science Fiction/Fantasy since. This is a really good book for someone new to the genre, or for younger people looking for a lighter Science Fiction/Fantasy read."
1,This Rehash Didn't Phaze Me,"A tired reworking of the previous 3 books - which I thought were entertaining and inventive.I have no evidence, but it seems as if this episode was ghost written (possibly by a 15 year old male chauvinist). Or else Piers Anthony was completely devoid of any new ideas. (one wouldn't think that an author in his mid 50's - at the time of the book's publication - would be so obsessed with pre-pubescent sex, it dominates every other page).Of the approximately 300 pages, the first 150 are a tedious rehash of the first 3 books. Gone are the ingenious settings and situations and characters - replaced with boring characters (even more boring since they are duplicated both in Phaze and Proton) and the prurient leerings of a aging, frustrated voyeur.It's sad when a talented author loses the spark.If you are desperate for more Phaze, I advise checking it out from the library. My copy is going to Goodwill."
5,"Absolutely Beautiful performance, gorgeous dancers.","I have seen very much modern dance over the last few years.Last week I saw Zumanity in Las Vegas Nevada playing at the Treasure Island playhouse, and then ordered this DVD.After seeing this DVD I will start collecting dance DVD and videos.Where I live it is hard to find live performances ( Pennsylvania )Watch and Enjoy"
4,"Works well, tastes AWFUL","This was the perfect solution for my little bunny rabbit who likes to chew EVERYTHING. I just spray it on (furniture, electric cords, anything) and after smelling--and maybe trying-- he leaves it alone. Just be careful, because somehow it always makes it's way into my mouth or nose (the teeniest drop on your hand is SO powerful!) and it really tastes bad...."
5,Great hiking boots,I live in northern MN and hike several days a week. I love these boots! They are durable and water proof.
4,Everyday favorites,"One of my favorite vegetarian cookbooks. Nothing fancy, but lots of reliable everyday meals and a few real gems. My favorites are the black bean chili (meat eaters don't realize it's veggie) and the triple rice salad (beautiful and perfect for the holidays). I've given this book as a gift to at least 3 others--none are vegetarians, but they all love this book."
4,"Very good, although I like QVP better","Quick Vegetarian Pleasures, by the same author, is a real standout. This book is also way above average, but there are a few duds in here too. The spinach couscous soup, for example, is just plain bland. Still, there's alot of good stuff, and for the most part, the recipes have a high reward-to-effort ratio."
5,The BEST vegetarian cookbook - even for the non vegetarian.,"While my family is not ""vegetarian"" we do consider ourselves ""almost vegetarian"". After receiving an e-mail from Amazon.com announcing the publication of this book in December, I ordered it. Since then, I have prepared well over half of the recipes - many more than once. We have NEVER been disappointed. The recipes are interesting, delicious, easy to prepare, healthy and appreciated by all. I have recommended this book to several friends and plan on giving it as a gift to others."
3,missing an important veggie,I like this cookbook and own it but recently noticed that carrots are missing. Look in the index: no carrots listed for anything. I love and use carrots a lot. They are a wonderful nutritious vegetable. Why would a vegetarian cookbook not have carrot recipes?
2,she loved it but she tore it apart pretty quickly,"Since it's really soft and wonderful to the touch, I initially thought it was a baby's toy and not a puppy's toy and wasn't sure if it was going to last my 4 month old yorkie. Sure enough within the hour she had managed to pulled out some of the soft fibers of the toy and had exposed the mesh lining beneath. May be better for children and not puppies...."
3,Not for serious chewers,"This is our Australian Terrier's favorite toy. She is now on ""Lambie IV"". It is not particularly chew resistant so it depends on how much your dog likes it as to how long it will last. It was one of our dog's first chew toys and the dog is four years old."
5,Highly Enjoyable,"A friend recommended this cd to me and at first I was a little skeptical. I was pleasantly suprised when I discovered that this is perhaps one of the best cds ever. I never tire of it, and it seems to get better and better each time you listen to it. The songs are very catchy and intelligently written. Lyrics such as ""I'm leaning on this broken fence between past and present tense"" from the song Aside get so easily engrained in your cranium and they are not easy to get out. The lead singer has a very different sounding voice, yet it is very pleasant. Highly recommended."
4,Underrated album from excellent group,"Starting off less then brilliant, Landed nonetheless proceeds to tear into Kraut-rock psychedelia with a warped precision that would remain a high mark for the genre throughout modern recording. Sure it may lack the tightness found in previous masterworks, but Landed soars all it's own. In a fantastic mid-stretch, Can continues to improve the sonic jam via their core of profound guitar and drumming based wizardry amongst much exotic instrumentation and playing styles. With their combined interests in bossanova and experimental rock amongst others, the pioneering band really justify their undersung influence when listening to such (still) fresh work."
2,Almost their worst album.,"I was compelled to whip up a quick review after sitting in disbelief; how anybody can give this album a positive review is beyond me. Let me add, before continuing, that I have been a very devoted CAN fan since high school and have owned all of their albums throughout the years. In this case, you will know that my loyalty is not what is on trial here.From the tacky/kitsch lyrics, to the murky production quality, and the poor songwriting, this album is an all around failure. The redeemable track and the only thing keeping me from tossing it out with their 1978 albumOut of Reachis ""Vernal Equinox"". Even so, a far superior version of the song is to be found onCan Box Music: Live 1971-1977.Every time I listen to this album, I wind up feeling embarrassed for Michael (R.I.P.), Holger, Irmin, and Jaki."
5,Works well for me,I bought this to replace my previously broken 1/2hp pump. I use it to pump out water out from pond or pool. It has enough power for what I need. I like the fact it came with an adapter for garden hose. My previously pump didn't and I had to make my own adapter from several PVC adapters.
4,Works well on hot tubs,I bought this product to empty my hot tub. It empties it quicker then I can fill and clean it with my garden house. I like how a regular garden house can hook up to it. And you can use a water nozzle or sprinkler and water your garden at the same time. Good value and good overall product.
2,Simer 2305,"My basement was flooded. The pump I received didn't even start. Called customer service for replacement. I ended up getting a differnt model from the local store. They did send another pump over, but it took another week or so. By that time my basement was dry already."
1,Don't Buy Simer - You're Warned.,"I purchased this pump last year intending for emergency use, and did not use it until yesterday. You know what? It only hums but no water coming out! Called Simer and Amazon. None of them will provide any help. It turned out I just purchased a junk which is supposed to help in emergency situations. Don't buy any product from Simer, period!"
1,Disappointed,"I purchased this for my elderly parents so they could remove standing water from around their home. Unfortunately, they were never able to use it because it was broken when received. Apparently, it had been returned previously because the styrafoam packing pieces which stabilize the unit in the box were missing. Therefore, the pump just bounced around in the Simer box. Also, whoever packed it for shipping is not the sharpest tack in the box. The small Simer box was dumped into a HUGE box with one piece of brown packing paper and nothing else.The only positive thing I can say is that Amazon was great about giving me my refund. Because it was received damaged, they even paid for the return shipping."
1,Major issue with buying this through Amazon.,"I see others have had this problem with Simer pumps as well. Be forewarned. Even though the description states ""1-year manufacturer's warranty"" this is bogus. If you call Simer and try to get anything done with this pump in a years time, they will tell you Amazon is not a certified Simer dealer and will not honor the warranty. Mine quit working after the first time I used it. I have no choice but to ship it back to Amazon (at my cost) and hope they give me some sort of a refund. I bought this thing about 6 months ago so I'm not sure what to expect. I will update this review when I find out the outcome.As far as the pump goes. It worked fine that one time. Now when I plug it in, it just hums and draws no water. That one use wasn't worth the $55."
5,Works as advertised !!,I bought this pump to drain water out of an in ground pool and it worked flawlessly. Ran for quite a long time with no overheating. I would recommend this product.
4,hose adapter,"The pump works perfect for what I purchased it for HOWEVER it was recommended that you purchase the 1 1/2"" hose to go with it but the Simer pump doesn't come with an adapter to adapt to that diameter. After going to Home Depot to find an adapter I found it easier to just buy from them a 24ft, 1 1/4"" hose kit that comes with an adapter to fit the pump. I wasted $$ purchasing the 1 1/2"" hose to go with the pump. What I did do was buy a 1 1/4 to 1 1/2"" hose adapter so I can hook the 2 hoses together if I want to pump the water 48 ft instead of the shorter 24 ft just using one section of hose. DON'T BUY THE ""RECOMMENDED"" 1 1/2"" HOSE THAT THEY SUGGEST WITH THE PUMP."
5,"So far, so good","I am very pleased with this pump. I use it to pump gray water from our washer from a collection tank to water our trees, etc. It is much more powerful than the comparably priced Little Giant that I previously used (althogh the Little Giant lasted a long time). I keep it on a timer so that it does not pump dry."
5,sibmersible utility pump,Product works fine. Pleased with the time line of receiving the product. Price was better then anyplace I had checked even with postage.
3,Good Starter...,"But not professional quality.Buying a Mollard Baton would be best, but if you're just beginning and fear breaking your Mollard on the concertmaster's head, a wooden baton with a cork handle...wont hurt as much as a standard fiberglass one.Not bad, but not great either."
3,Good service - not so good product.,"I have no quibble with the service given from this company. Speedy & efficient; I wish I could compliment the disc but I can`t; the stereo channelling is very poor, lead vocal panned to one side, backing to the other & as a sometime radio presenter, it would be a problem.AMcDonald"
3,Extended what?,All the songs on this cd are form the King Biscuit Flower Hour.It's not worth anyway if have the King Biscuit Flower Hour cd.
4,"Nothing New, Corporate Hustling, I still like it!","ELP live, how can you ever go wrong? This is one band that is always better hearing in their passionate rawness of a live concert, not many bands can do that. I will say this title is basically 100% BS. Actually tracks like ""Lucky Man"" (""My personal favorite version of this is the more harden voice of Greg Lake in the 97/98 Then & Now tour""), is shorter than almost every version I've heard, but it still rocks, as does ""Still...You Turn Me On"".This isn't a waste of money, just some classic prog.. rock tunes that are done in fashion, but no order, but still nicely done, definitely if someone has never heard ELP, this is a nice cd for them to get a little taste of them, but there is so much more to them than this.Thanks ELP for all the great memories that you have instilled in us by your creative works of music. Truly you 3 are the best in all that you do, & the memories still continue!"
1,"Product, product, product....","If ever there was a ""worst of"" disc, this would have to be it. Who is putting this stuff out and, more importantly, who is spending their hard earned money to buy it? Washed up, burned out, needy, greedy. Sad to say, this band was one of my favorites in the 70's."
3,Worth buying for the opening track alone,"The first track, 'What Do You Want From Me' is the best on the album, having the trademark Peter Hook bass intro, which is possibly one of the best uses of a bass guitar ever. The song itself is incredibly catchy. Somone Who Needs Me is the other addictive song on the album, and the rest, while not exactly fillers, are not up to the same standard. Nevertheless it's a very listenable album and well worth picking up second hand as it seems to be deleted at present."
1,Hands Across the table,"I'm sorry but ever since Sugar Ray left Roomful of Blues, not only has Roomful gone downhill, but so has Sugar Ray. His voice was perfect for the jump blues, swinging style of that great band. But on his own, he lacks focus and his choices of material do not fit his strengths. The sound is hollow and flat and the energy weak. If it were not for his good harmonica licks, I wouldn't even give this album 1 star. A major disappointment from a guy that was my favorite vocalist when he was with Roomful."
5,Weber Rocks On!,"I love this grill, and I love Weber. My first Weber lasted 10 years of year round use (in New England) and finally died on me. I had a lot of trouble finding a good selection of Webers at local mass retailer, (HD), but found this on line for less, with no shipping and no state tax. It assembled in about two hours, and looks and works great. Push button ignition works especially well."
5,Weber Grill,This replaced a prior Weber gas grill that was about 20 years old. It was hard for my husband to let go of the old one but the new one has won his heart. I have also used it and it is a dream to operate...even in Wisconsin winters. No regrets about this purchase.
3,Sherman tank of BBQs,This is one heavy built BBQ. Hopefully it will last more then 5+ years like my last Lowes BBQ. Set up is a big job. Get everything layed out over a large work area and prepare for about 2 hours.
4,Weber Grills Well,After finally receiving my gorgeous Weber a debacle not worth mentioning I openned the box and decided to call the nearest Barbq Galore store to have it assembled. Done deal! Now that it is up and running I think it is an amazingly efficient machine and would highly reccomend it.
3,Doesn't Work with JBuds,"Well, they are well made and are helpful for the stock earbuds that came with my ipod but totally are useless with my Jbud earbuds. The ""hole"" for the ear portion of the earbuds does not go thru but is a pocket and only fits certain size earbuds. Just something to be aware of."
3,Cute but not exactly cordless!,"These devices are perhaps a little more cute than they are functional. I still get my cords twisted and tangled around them. Better than nothing though. The keep both cords together in my pocket, but take as minute to unravel them when I need to use the headset."
2,NOT FOR THIN CABLES,"I bought this product for my iPod Touch, because having the headphones wrap around the iPod bothers me. I can say that it doesn't work that well for the regular iPod stock headphones, as the cable is too thin and it gets lose all the time. On the other hand, I have a android phone and the product works great with those stock headphones because the cable is thicker, so just take that into consideration when purchasing this product."
3,"ok, not great (or even very good)","These ear bud holders do an ok job of holding your earbuds, but there's got to be something better. The actual buds themselves fit nicely into the holes meant for them, but then . . . there's no place to neatly and completely wrap the cord in order to store them. The picture accompanying the item shows the cord wrapped neatly around the holder, but notice that it doesn't show the entire cord including the plug. I could not replicate that nice neat wrapping job that they do when I tried to wrap the entire cord around the holder. So I suppose my final judgement would be that the Smart Wrap is fine for cord management - to reduce the amount of slack in the cord - but not especially great for actually storing your earbuds. At least they are cheap."
4,"Intricately plotted, steeped in emotion.","The Chill by Ross Macdonald has an intricately woven plot that could justifiably be referred to as byzantine. Hired by a distraught bridegroom to find his runaway bride, the doggedly persistent Lew Archer soon finds himself investigating a series of murders that spans more than two decades as well as half a continent.This very intriguing ""whodunit"" contains smartly written dialogue, many well crafted and evocative descriptive passages, a large number of interesting characters and an unexpected gem of an ending. Moreover, the narrative is fast paced, compelling and emotionally gripping.Definitely one of Macdonald's most unforgettable and jarring efforts. Highly recommended."
5,His best book,"Moody, creepy, complex, and sad, this is MacDonald's best book. I think its as good as Chandler (and that is very good indeed). This was written in the early 60s when RM was at his peak, and manages probably his best surprise as well as his most memorably creepy denouement. All the Archers from this time are excellent, but this one stands out."
3,good quick read,"The surprise with this novel was not only the ending, it was MacDonald's way with adjectives and description. Without being verbose, he quickly paints vivid images of southern California, the characters peopling his story, and the action. This is not violent nor does it require a score card to keep track of who's on first. A good dective novel; a quick read; it will reel you in and keep your attention."
4,Will exercise your mind keeping the plot straight.,"A well-woven plot that ties the present to the past. Not as good as ""The Underground Man,"" another MacDonald book, but similar and still very well done. The writing style is hard-boiled, but literate. It comes to something of an abrubt end, but the lead-up juggles enough suspects, witnesses, and victims across a twenty year time-span to keep you entertained."
2,One of the Ten Best Mystery Writer's...,"...according to an article by Lawrence Block. Or, more accurately, one of his ten favorite. But he said something else in his article that made me laugh, as it was so true.He said that the singular fact of a Ross MacDonald book is that once you've read it and put it down, you can't remember anything about it. That is such a truism; I've read some of his books more than once, not knowing if I've read them before. And if I took one from my collection and began reading, I know I'd think it was the first time. They are all so similar and forgettable. I will say MacDonald must rank up there in the list of top mystery writers, but I'll be damned if I can remember any one thing about any of the many books of his I've read."
1,No suspense to be found here,"Not a good read. Lacks any suspense or thrills. I know this is supposedly ""vintage"" but I have read alot of vintage with real character development and thrills both. Also, plot development is very slow. Conclusions are predictable."
1,"If these are the tracks you are looking for, don't order this.","The tracks listed here are the songs from the original 1965 album titled ""Yeh Yeh"". You might think ""Great! Just what I want!"". But, when you order it, you'll receive a CD titled ""yeh Yeh"" with a completely different track listing. The only song that is actually on this CD from the 1965 album is the title song ""Yeh Yeh"", nothing else.You'll just end up sending it back as I did.Yes, the original album was great, but the CD you'll get is so disappointing that you'll try to warn others ahead of time, as I am now.If you do order this, well ........ I warned you!"
4,Entertaining and interesting!,"A good overview of the life of a knight. Who knew it took knights so long to get dressed in their armor, or that they wore so many layers? Large print, easy vocabulary and colorful illustrations for grades 3-5."
1,Disappointing,"In 1959 I had an LP recording of Josh White--the album cover all washed in blue featured a photo of Josh White wearing faded overalls and playing the guitar, looking like a farmer sitting on the porch of a sharecropper's cabin. Admittidly pretty hokey, but the recording was my favorite thing--ballads mostly, sung in a voice so plaintive and full of yearing and sadness. This recently purchased album was such a disappointment that I started skipping to the next tune over and over until the whole dismal business finally ended and I just tossed it into the trash bin with no regret, other than having wasted more than $10.. Now I'm wondering if there are 2 performers named Josh White--I heard no resemblance at all to the album I had years ago. This album has no merit at all on any level that I could appreciate."
2,"Some decent songs, but ultimately self indulgent","Everything (the music, lyrics and vocals) ranges from decent to forgettable. There is some talent here, but too often there are strong moments followed by lapses in focus and execution, frequently in the same song. And some of the vocals are just too self-indulgent, appearing superficial rather than genuine expressions of emotion. Anyone who has seen him live will not find this surprising. This guy has some ability, but his focus lacks depth and never seems to extend beyond himself. Too bad."
4,iTrip is the best wireless transmitter on the market!,"So you want an iTrip?It's lightweight, portable, drains minimal to standard power from your iPod works well with any free signal. I use it all the time at work and it transmits great no static, I can listen to my iPod for hours at a time no switching CD's.On the road, I get interference heading into K.C. and other cities, Dead Zones, Cell Towers all cause interference. This is a minor inconvenience as it works hella good in my town.Minor point, the stronger your reciever is in your car stereo the more static you'll get and the harder it will be to use the iTrip. This happens mostly with higher end stereos as I found out on a road trip in my friend's truck. My stereo a Kenwood CD/stereo works like a dream with the iTrip. Best money I could've spent...besides my beloved, snuggly-wuggly iPod. Yes, I endorse the iTrip."
3,Great while it's fully functional,"I've had this little travel alarm clock for several years now, but unfortunately it hasn't held up. Brand new out of the box it would beep whenever you pressed the nightlight button (annoying if you're traveling in hostels where other people are trying to sleep). Then after a couple of months of use the INDIGLO nightlight stopped working all together. Finally I could no longer rely on it at all when it started resetting itself randomly only a year after purchase. Too bad - it's very well designed and slick. I loved using it when all the features worked."
3,Expected Brighter...,"Basing my expectations by the picture provided, I felt I was misinformed. The dot is also smaller than expected. With the combination of it's lack of size and low brightness, it makes it hard to find thru my ghost ring at night. This is my first Meprolight so have no other comparison."
2,Underwhelming,"Unfortunately, this book does not succeed in being either 1) a juicy and thought-provoking expose, or 2) a well-written and engaging travelogue. It reads like a series of PG-rated magazine articles strung together with very little theme or continuity. The writing is journalistic and pretty bland. Wouldn't recommend it, especially at $15-$20 retail for a thin paperback you could finish in a day and will never touch again."
4,Dance with ABBA! (3.5 stars),"While the 1979's ""Voulez-Vous"" for many people does not make Top 3 of ABBA albums, it's one of the best disco-parties you can ever come across. Some of the songs are really the cream of ABBA, including two ballads ""I Have a Dream"" (track 3) and ""Chiquitita"" (track 8) that - depending on your opinion - either slow down the party, or come at the right time for dancers to chill. Among the best purely pop songs ever produced by ANYONE are ""Angeleyes"", ""Does Your Mother Know"" and the bonus track ""Gimme! Gimme! Gimme!"", later so well sampled in Madonna's ""Hung Up"". The album also includes minor gem ""If It Wasn't For the Night"", where the supergroup somehow came close to successfully emulating their signature hit ""Dancing Queen"". Cohesive in genre albeit slightly uneven in quality, ""Voulez-Vous"" is however not any less intoxicating than any of ABBA longplayers."
5,I Love ABBA,"Any purchaser who enjoys ABBA will enjoy Voulez-vous. My favorites on this CD are ""Angel Eyes,"" and ""Voulez-vous."" ABBA had a certain type of fans - those of us who loved them in their hey day and still listen to their music now because it never ages."
4,I enjoy anything ABBA . . .,". . . And this item does not let me down. What can I say? I like ABBA's music and when one is so prejudiced for something, it's hard to find fault with their products.If you like ABBA, you'll most likely enjoy this CD."
4,not their best.,"ABBA nearly lost it with this album. Instead of capitalising on the strengths of the previous ""Album"", they 'went disco' and produced their stalest, most formulaic album. There are some great songs on it, but the production sounds the most dated of their albums. Most people wrote them off after ""Voulez-vous"" - until ABBA released ""The Winner Takes It All""."
4,Hits all the right notes for a Hammer horror,"An original premise, great atmosphere, good cast - this has all the elements we've come to expect from a Hammer gothic horror. There are no stars, but the cast is excellent anyway, especially Noel Willman, Jacqueline Pearce and Hammer veteran Michael Ripper, in one of his finest roles.The makeup and effects are memorable, even if the Reptile's occasionally shoddy appearance has caused a bit of mirth over the years."
1,Why Are These DVD's Going OOP So Faast,"The Ones I'm Talking about are The Hammer Collection DVDs By themselves ""Not The Double Features"" and Even Some of the DF's are oop There are some I Want Like ""Dracula - Prince of Darkness""or ""The Reptile"" and ""Frankenstein Created Woman"" But they are oop I Have This Movie the one i have is ""The Lost Continent/The Reptile. The Lost Continent Sucked It Would be Better if I Had Just The DVD of ""The Reptile"" Come on Achor Bay You guys went ooptooo fast"
2,Hammer's lizard monster flick is a re-hashed mediocrity,"Hammer did at least one film about each type of monster that was somewhat popular in American monster films in the 1930's and 50's, hence this entry in the Creature from the black lagoon lizard-creature films. The story revolves around a couple who move to a village and discover people being killed in way that causes them to become badly discolored by a cheap make-up job. Noel Willman plays a wealthy man with an odd daughter that he is trying to confine. This film seems similiar in plot to the Gorgon, only this film is uneven and less convincing in it's plot. The acting is overall decent, but the story is thin and the ending is predictable. The monster is amusing beacuse it is hilariously bad. This is not a terrible film, but the problems in the story causes it to be only average. The Reptile is worth one viewing, but not a whole lot more."
1,just plain terrible,this is one of the worst CD's ive ever bought . Don't waste your money bying this junk!
3,Ok book - sourcecode is completely useless,"If you want a book that gives basic explanation of fuzzy logic - this one is not that bad. If you want this book because it comes with 'free' code - look elsewhere. I'm a programmer with 10 years of C++ experience but I have not seen worse code than is supplied with this book. And believe me, I've seen a lot of bad code - I even wrote some of it :)."
1,Not a practicle book,"By chapter 3 I realized Dr. Cox completely fails to document the assumptions and reasoning behind the formulas he illustrates. He fails to even clearly list formulas in the book. He provides mini C-code programs that will quickly become dated and the book totally useless that you can spend time picking through to eventually derive formulas, assuming they are even correct at this point in time. Do yourself a favor, check it out from the library and take a look at it first. Don't get stuck like I did with an overpriced paperweight. A ""first course in fuzzy logic"" by Hung Nguyen may be better. I looked through random pages and at least it has the formulas, how and why they are developed. I'm going to check it out of the library first. Ours did not carry Dr. Cox's book so I could not look at it before buying."
5,Herencia para un hijo gaucho,"The CD is very well done, the sound is clear and well presented.El CD esta muy bien hecho, el sonido limpio y bien presentado.El Tema->Quizas la mejor cancion y poema folklorico argentino, y el canta-autor Don Jose Larralde sabe como llegarle al corazon a ese individuo que siempre fue hijo,para abrirle los ojos a ese ciego que no sabe ver,y aunque algunas palabras no se entiendan porque son regionales se puede decir que se ""sienten"". Gran obra."
1,Blank Twice,"Unfortunately didn't get to hear it. Ordered this CD, plus another Marco Antonio Solis, and both were blank. Ordered a replacement and when they both arrved, the two of them were blank, again. Gave up and asked for a refund! The rest of the Marco Antonio Solis/Los Bukis CD's are great. Cannot get tired of his music. He is a excellent singer,composer, etc. Can listen to his music all day long."
5,Excellent!!!,Matt does a great job at providing a step by step plan for attracting high net worth clients. If you are looking to build a successful financial advisory practice this is a must read!!!!!
3,Renaissance building houses beautiful maps of Italy,"In 1580 Pope Gregory XIII commissioned this gallery with 42 large panels that represent Italy. Maps on the right side show the Adriatic side of the peninsula; those on the left side show the Tyrrhenian and Ligurian coasts. The quality of the paper and reproductions is excellent. Each map is discussed, and close-ups show the art and craft of the cartographers and artists. The author claims that this is the largest cycle of geographic images in Europe. This is a book to linger with; no matter your nationality, it may make you homesick."
4,A Friend of The Mountain,This is a book for those who love to travel acrossing the mountains. Not only very helpful for it seem like a text-compas: show us to the direct path.
1,Horrible,"This movie failed on many levels. First, the acting was pathetic. Absolutely no chemistry between the actors; despite the nearly constant gratuitous sex scene, they didn't quite mesh. Second, and most annoyingly, there were huge numbers of errors, so much in fact that it seemed no one bothered to watch the video before it went final. For example, the movie constantly switches from indoor to outdoor shots. Every indoor shot is clearly done at nighttime; the windows are visible, and always dark. However, magically, every outdoor shot is in the daylight. It just gets annoying. Third, the killer, rather than being a fabled practitioner of black arts, seems much more like a red neck ninja. Overall, its very disjointed, poorly acted, awfully scripted and a waste of time. Avoid."
4,"You feel like part of the family, whether you want to or not",Downright hysterical comedy that manages to keep the characters all too real. You can almost certainly identify at least several characters and point to what member of your family they correspond to. It will make you feel better about your holiday get togethers.
3,Good but with a minor flaw.,"The first half of this film is great. I can watch it over and over. But it takes a downhill turn when the younger sister's family arrives and they treat her like dirt. After that it's hard to sympathize with Holly Hunter's character, who becomes surprisingly self centered and ignorant about her sister.But it does redeem itself by the end. After watching it several times I can appreciate it, especially the vision that Holly Hunter has of her family at the end. But I don't know if it's a dream, a fantasy, or a memory."
5,My favorite Holiday movie ever,This is my comfort movie. I watch it like most 5 year olds watch the newest Disney movie. This is my family in 90 minutes.
1,above explanation,It is explained above; it is explained above; it is explained above; it is explanined aboveit is explained above
5,JOSIE COTTON ROCKS!!!,"This is a great cd of 80's New Wave paying homage to the great 60's girl group sound! Josie Cotton ROCKS!!! Every tune is great & there's no filler. This is fun, feel good music. The best songs are (the campy, cult, novelty tune) ""Johnny Are You Queer?"", ""He Could Be The One"", ""Rockin' Love"", ""Systematic Way"", ""Tell Him"", ""Jimmy Loves Maryann"", ""License To Dance"", ""Life After Love"", & ""Gina"". Aside from the music, Josie had two of the coolest album covers from the 1980's! Especially her ""Convertible Music"". In 1995, she released a dark, gloomy album as Josey Cotton on Roxco Records called ""Frightened By Nightingales"". It was produced by Bill Rhea & it's pretty dreadful. If you like her ""Convertible Music""/""From The Hip"" albums, I also recommend both of Tracey Ullman's albums, ""You Broke My Heart In 17 Places"" (1983) & ""You Caught Me Out"" (1984)."
5,Linear Programming for the Non-Mathematician,"When researching how to use LPs, I came across many, many books that told me how LPs worked and gave me enough information that I could implement my own LP solver, had I the time and inclination. This is the first book I found that concentrated on how to think about problems so that they could be solved by an LP. Ultimately, my solution was far more complex than anything presented in the book, but the book gave me the initial patterns I needed to get started.If you're finding LPs a hard concept to wrap your head around, this would be the book I'd recommend."
3,"Good, but a reprint from 1970","This book presents a good conceptual overview of linear programming, geared for the non-mathmatical person. However, it is a reprint of a 1970 title, so there isn't much on the use of computers to solve this type of problem."
2,Sizzla is great but he's slackin,"I think this album is not very good. After listening to ""Praise Ye Jah"" , its sounds really bad. I don't expect it to be as good, but the effort here seems very weak. The music is not as good. His vocals really kill any effort that was made musically. It just doesn't sound that good when Sizzla sings like that. On this album, when he's not singing harder than he should, he sings softer than he should...(like he got kicked in the nads). I prefer the way his vocals used to sound. Overall, this album is weak."
4,neva stop burning down babylon,the ghetto fire rages...sizzla aint got nothin to prove...he's at the point where he can do anything he wishes...he's dropping a new cd every month now...amazon is soft...check out dealers in brooklyn and san francisco for all the sizzla releases...ghetto revolution is as tight as any other sizzla record...keep the fire blaze pon babylon
5,NLD says it's the balm,"Sizzla is an inspiration. People player hating on this album are probably not deep fans of Sizzla's artistry. I love dancehall vocals and Sizzla is certainly one of, if not the greatest dancehall vocalist of all time. The range and feeling that he can pull off is amazing, and the fact that he doesn't sound ridiculous doing it is even more amazing. This album is experimental with vocals, and I love it. Sometimes he is reminiscent of Louis Armstrong, sometimes old Lee Perry, and always unique and innovative. He's not biting other emcees but he sure is getting bit. ONE LOVE If you are a Sizzla fan, you will dig this album. Advance and face the future."
5,good reading,"Just got this book through chance. It's a great read. I think the blurb in the book summed it up well when it said something about uniting the traditional buddhist and taoist values with the more confucian. It reads like confucianized tao te ching - lots of parables of wisdom but made more ""real life"" - thus a but more accessible to a casual reader as opposed to the tao de ching, which a more light reader may not be able to grasp.I am very happy with the translation, although I do not speak chinese, i feel as if there was a lot of care put into it. Great book. great job by the translators."
2,What a disappointment!,"I ordered this CD ""Chet Atkins/Doug Stone"", believing it to be a collaberation of the two artists. It is not. There is one CD of Chet, and one CD of Doug. The songs on the Chet CD, I have from previous CD's. Chet is always great, but these songs are not unique. I am not a big fan of Doug Stone's, but figured teamed up with Chet, hey, why not.... This is misleading, and unless you have no other Chet CD's, and happen to really love Doug Stone, don't waste your money."
5,"Cheese Louise is not ""cheesey""","I am a school psychologist, and a few weeks ago I was asked to read a book to several classes of second graders. While casually browsing, I happened to pick up the book ""Cheese Louise"", and found it very captivating, humorous, with delightful illustrations. The children I read to were completely captivated by the story, and several wanted copies of the book for themselves."
4,Review from Books That Heal Kids,"This is an entertaining and vividly illustrated story about food in the fridge. All of the food items can talk and have names! The story starts with, Louise, a piece of Swiss cheese with low self-esteem. She thinks her holes are horrible. She wants so badly to be perfect so she will be ""chosen"" every time the fridge door opens. She even tries filling her holes with pudding. The story ends with Louise finding her inner strength and also using the her holes to help save a fellow food item. She comes to realize her ""flaws"" are actually gifts. I like using Cheese Louise to discuss the ""myth of perfection."" Kids start at an early age comparing themselves to others. They notice the differences and often see them as a negative. The message in this story proves that thinking to be false. As a school counselor, it's a fun one to read to the kids."
5,A lasting book for all ages,"I have had this book since it was first published and it continues to be a favorite in our house....from a favorite read aloud to now a favorite to read! A cute story that inspires the question, ""what if?"" for writer's to be be!"
3,Cute but not captivating,"""Cheese Louise"" does indeed capitalize a bit on its ""cheese"" factor. The characters aren't terribly deep (they look rather too much like the VeggieTales characters for comfort), the situation is rather predictable, and the story as a whole tends toward the tedious. While it does communicate the concept of self-worth and appreciation, it doesn't make much of the fact that when Louise is ""chosen,"" she is, in fact, EATEN and is no more, except in the memory of her compatriots who are left behind. I hope that none of them are left in that back drawer too long waiting to be chosen!"
1,Disappointment,"The themes and feelings of these songs are lost unfortunately. The lineup isn't bad but they fall short. Surprisingly, the best solo is from Dweezil Zappa on Goodbye to Romance: he captures Randy's solo and adds some taste to it. Mr. Crowley is a disappointment: Y. Malmsteen totally ignores the feel of the song and decides to shred instead, what a shame. Suicide Solution is a dance remix which confuses the hell out of me. In addition, the solos are recorded poorly: they are not put out front and are difficult to discern."
3,A little less than I was expecting...,"Well, my old US-made LC-2 straps were a bit flat, and I had to replace them. I was hoping for something as well-made and durable as the well-nigh invincible original components.I got this particular item as the replacement, and they have held up so far, but they feel...chintzy. Only one side has the quick-release capability, the fittings are half the thickness of the originals, the nylon webbing twists easier, and the size adjustment isn't quite as solid. In addition, these things were made by the Chinese. Is there lead in them? Are they full of toxic compounds? Will I develop contact dermatits. *sigh* I wish I could get the higher-quality ones at a decent price...I can't pass further judgement until they wear out, but I think that you should keep poking around for a better-quality set at a better price."
4,Very worth having,"Lots of artistic play going on here. Experimental? That's a pretty meaningless term, unless you believe in progress. Let's say these boys are trying on a lot of artistic roles, the result being the band comes off here like acid-shaman method-actor improv musicians. Malcolm Mooney never looked better than on the tracks included here. And everyone else is, well, just as good as you would expect. A fair amount of dreck and drivel, which are the prices of trying different things, and a fair amount of absolute gems."
4,Santa Fe 1987 Motive Power Pictorial Book,"I haven't had a chance to more than quickly thumb through the book, but I like what I've seen so far. Tons of pictures and lots of interesting history and information. The only thing they could have done better was put more color pictures. Those blue and gold Yellowbonnets I love so much aren't as impressive in black and gray."
3,Good way to Display these Puzzles,"These Puzzle stands are great for displaying this type of Puzzle, i was quite dissapointed that the puzzle hanger i got was not like the one they show in the picture, the one in the picture shows someone holding the hanger in the air, and when they show the packaging it doesn't look anything like it, when i see the picture on the website it leads me to belive that you hang them from the ceiling or something, it's nothing like that, it's a big metal stand that you can put on your table still very very usefull, but not what i thought i was orderingEsphera 360 9"" Magnetic Display Hanger"
3,description,"Crime-prevention educator Kevin Perline hosts this educational video designed for viewing by parents with their children, ages 5-10. Topics include: group safety, what children should do if they're separated from their parents, how to avoid dangerous strangers, safety in public places, school safety, and more. Part of ""The Personal Safety Series.""..>> more...MPAA Rating:Not RatedRuntime:27 minutes"
3,Not all that you think...,"While the DVD is fun and silly, I didn't really see or notice anything that would be called true nudity. Also, while the DVD case says one of the languages is English, I couldn't find it in the DVD's menu. I had to go to the DVD player's remote to just switch on the English subtitles! Lots of sexy, kinky females but I would have to say that even kids could watch this. They WON'T understand it, but there's nothing to offend the eyes.Only 30 minutes long, so not really a lot there to begin with.Also, after watching once I really don't find myself wanting to watch it again and again, like Tenchi Muyo!, Ranma 1/2, Outlaw Star or Cowboy Bebop. So,if you have to get it, get it used."
2,Might as well be G rated,"Supposedly 15 and above, but aside from the weird fetishes, it was pretty harmless. Don't get me wrong it wasn't totally bad, but it may have been better if only of these women actually did something to her. As it is, it seems silly that the title character gets so worked up when nothing has been done to her. Or maybe thats the point, when her copy takes off its clothing, she gets so anxious because this clone of her is actually playing out desires that she is afraid to admit to herself, specifically a need to be an exhibitionist, to be loved by other women, and to feel pleasure. This is the most plausible explanation to why she keeps having these fantasies; sure, you could argue that Miyuki is the victim of this world, but the real reason is that she actually want this. Sadly, the real Miyuki never receives anything but a tease from all these women."
2,not worthy,Basically its just another story of Alice in Wonderland done in a very CLAMP way. The dvd is extremely short and has many of the women wearing skimpy outfits. I really felt like i was watching some sort of hentai while watching it. If anyone is a fan of clamp then this dvd might work. But for me this dvd was the worst. I will never watch this dvd again so you go ahead and say this review wasn't helpful to you its ok
5,Really Good Cookies! - Highly Recommended,"Since being diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes, I have been on a quest for low carb, no sugar snacks. Joesph's Sugar Free Cookies are a real find!A pack of about 10 cookies has more than 150 calories, and upwards of 20 or so net carbs so you do have to be aware that these can have a glycemic impact. I usually ration myself to 4 or 5 cookies per serving for less than 100 calories and 8 or 10 carbs.All of the flavors in this assortment are good, but I really liked the Lemon and Chocolate Walnut best.Highly recommended!"
1,starvation may be better,"I've been experimenting with a variety of sugar-free chocolate snacks. I love brownies and was looking forward to these. I took one bite and spit it out. This is the worst-tasting crap I've eaten in over 50 years. I am amazed that any company has the chutzpah to put this vile crud on the market. If you have to choose between starving to death and eating these brownies, think very carefully."
3,Joseph's Sugar Free Cookies Choc. Chip/Brownie,"The chocolate chip cookie and brownie both have a good taste. They do not taste like a sugar free product in the sense that there is no after-taste. However, usually when I eat a cookie or brownie I am expecting a sweet indulgence or guilty pleasure. I know this is better for me so I will eat them as a snack but it will take time to get use to eating a cookie or brownie that is mildly sweet."
1,A bunch of experiments,"As for many of these kind of unknown groups, the music in the album is useless. In the meaning that this music has no use. It is not relaxing. It is not for contemplation. It is not spiritual. It is nothing but electronic esperiments that many vendors try to deliver under the name of ""ambient"". But ambient music is music. THis is crap.Well differently from TWO A.D. where probably the producers realized that crap is crap and no more crap was good to be sold, because people isn't stupid.TWO A.D. is light years away from this crap.Don't waste your money. Listen the the samples by yourself to grab what I mean.Sergio"
1,Give me a break!,"this book was an assigned text in an ethics class I took. What a joke! animals are cute and cuddley (sometimes), but we don't owe them squat. if you want to eat them, eat them. If you don't, don't. Simple as that. Vegetarianism is about as essential (and as important) as a soap opera."
5,Keep this in your kitchen!,"the next time you' tell youself that you can't face another soy burger, pull out this book and read Tolstoy's description of a slaughter house or Schlieffer's visit to a factory farm...this book appeals to the heart and the head...I gave copies to my meat-eating parents for Christmas...neither have gone vegetarian, but they're a lot more careful about what they eat than they used to be, because they were so impressed with some of the arguments in this book..."
5,"History's most eloquent vegetarians, all in one book!","The editors did an excellent job of choosing, organizing and editing this fascinating book. The book includes writings from over 30 people (including relevant biograpical info), and useful bibliographies both pro- and anti-vegetarian. I spent a lot of time at libraries looking through the compact shelving until I discovered this book and found a lot of what I needed already organized and laid out before me. A must-read for all those interested in vegetarianism and humanity's relationship with other animals!"
4,British film noir with a beatnik hipster spin,"This is a pretty entertaining movie, proving that the Brits were capable of film noir in the 60's. It has an interesting beatnik/jazz-era vibe more associated with late 50's US films. While it leans toward melodrama, particularly the acting of the beautiful lead actress, it stays true to film noir with its very dark behaviors and outcomes and a pervasive hopelessness. High contrast B&W (or is it just a cheap Sinister Cinema print--but thanks anyway, guys, for making this available!!), jaunty camera angles and nightmarish city images keep it interesting. (Side note: thru Amazon, many obscure noir and thriller titles, probably all public domain, are available in bare bones prints by Sinister Cinema for $8.99 each, a bargain for those interested in such fare.)"
2,Doesn't work while recharging,"I liked the idea of the wireless mouse with rechargable batteries (Logitech MX700); I hate using the fingerpad. I do encounter the sync/initialization problem on occasion, though sometimes it comes up working. This mouse has another serious flaw besides the sync problem: The mouse is unusable while it is being recharged. The mouse is recharged by hooking a power wire up to the USB port of the laptop. To charge the mouse, the laptop must be on and the mouse doesn't work while it is recharging so the port is wasted. Seems to me a better design would have allowed the mouse to be used as a corded mouse while it was charging."
2,Works Intermittently - Virtually No Good Docs -,"I'm taking mine back. It feels pretty good and has a nice case, but stops communicating with the receiver frequently. When the computer starts up it doesn't recognize the mouse. There is a button at the bottom of the mouse which must be pushed to get the USB adapter to recognize the mouse. The button is too small to press by hand. So, MUST have a pen or pencil to push it EVERY time you start up your laptop. A real pain! You also have to push the button within a reasonable time on the USB adapter. Why should you have to do any button pushing at all. Poor design results in a less that useful product. Pay a little more and get a better wireless laptop mouse."
2,Poor recharging base,"Well, this mouse didn't last long at my house. First, you have to charge the mouse for 8 hours before first use. Ok, I hooked that up. It worked for about 5 minutes before the green light (indicating that it is charging) starting flashing. Turns out the charger is broken. One of the contacts stopped making contact. Ok, this mouse is going back to the store. It is a standard sized mouse. The buttons seem ok, but since it never charged up, I can't say much more. Don't buy it."
4,excellent,"Everyone knows Jobim'sWave,Tide, and his work with Stan Getz, mainly ""Girl From Impanina""But that was the sixties. This is Jobim on CTI in the 1970s, and the sound is unmistakeable. The production is slicker, there are a lot more electric keybords, and the cool 70s sound, which is really just getting its just due in the last fifteen or so years, is on full show.This is Jobim, and that means bossa nova. Good as the 1960s work is, this has more complicated progressions, deeper orchestrations, and overall, is a little harder to penetrate. Once you do, though, you may, like I, like the subtle sophistacation of this album even more than the A&M; or Verve albums."
3,Just okay,"I think this is the CD that arrived from Argentina in a paper envelope - not cardboard as the other 5 CDs were. When opened,the lid of the container was broken at the hinge, maybe only to be expected because of the lack of toughness for international shipping. Plays okay, though."
5,a great book of prayers,"When you need a prayer and you cannot find the words, this book is a great inspiration. I love it."
2,Not very helpful,"I did like the author's ""organization""-use of categories, so one could access the ""appropriate"" prayer--However, the prayers themselves were for the most part uninspired and often repetitive. I was hoping to use this book as a source for opening prayers to start meetings at our synagogue, but only a few are ""usable."" I think I could write better prayers myself."
5,Hope for a Hurting Nation,This book was so inspirational. The timing couldn't have been better after the disasters of Sept 11. The book really encouraged me as I read story after story of courageous men and women who had suffered but survived their ordeals. It will appeal to women as well as men. I highly recommend it for an uplift in your day
2,irritating,"Despite the cover, it's basically a single woman singing through most of the CD. Although I much liked some of the other CDs in this series, this is my least favorite. It seemed like she was making up the melodies as she went along, who knows? But even if she wasn't, it came across as grating and pretentious. It's certainly not music you'll be able to have on in the background.Much, much better in the same series was ""Les Voix Humaines"":Works for Lyra Viol & Bass Viol."
4,Cute and engaging,"Our twin daughters had just turned 3 when we got them this book. They are into the usual girly stuff but dragons and dinosaurs top the list, so we bought this book for the dragon. This book was a tiny bit disappointing in the story and that is the only reason I gave it a 4 and not a 5. I really like the artwork, and the girls really like the book overall, one of the girls always gasps in fear playfully when the princess gets scared as she and her brother approach the dragons cave. So, if you've dragon addicts like I do, add this one to your dragon book collection."
2,Worst Product - Scratched my paint and broke in 6 weeks,"I purchased this and placed it on my new car and within 6 weeks of ownership it has ripped on both sides near the wheelwell as well as scratched the paint from cheap connectors. Its one of the worst products, I would have rated it no stars or 1 but Amazon only let me place 2 stars.Stay Away, you have been warned."
4,Fit My 2001 Malibu just fine,"Mounting was fairly easy, instructions were good but the illustrations could have been better. Fit is excellent. Nice product. Great appearence. This LeBra should support my . . . headlights very nicely ! ;-)"
5,Excellent research and a wealth of information,An excellent source for anyone interested in the sometimes strange world of car dealers. Covers the history of car dealerships from the turn of the century to today. Chapters dealing with the design of a dealership and the history of famous and not so famous marques add to the over 130 black and white and 40 color photographs. Well written and fascinating. If you know a car nut this is the Christmas present of the year.
3,Great Photos A Bit Dated Now..,"I purchased this book for the ""Book Of The Month"" thing we do at the office. I work in the automotive aftermarket business. Everyone enjoyed the great pictures, especially the Parts Counters of the past. My only complaint is that the book was originally published in 1999, so it shows a bit dated in layout and editorial."
3,I wish it had more...,"This book was great if you're strictly interested in dealerships of the 30's, 40's, and 50's. Every photo in the book was not realistic for today's society. I'd have preferrred to have more information on how the dealerships of today are run."
4,"a nice try, very nice indeed","this album is a very nice try to mix techno/dance withjazz, an lies in between. it is a very nice music to belistened, and wesseltof is a quite good piano player. he iscreative and has a good band with him.from a jazz point of view is not a huge album, but is a verygood ""fusion"" album (the word fusion is not really sharp, butyou understand). i really have fun when i listen to it, and idance a lot when i do. it can even be played in a party andeverybody will dance and nobody will tell ""get out that jazzstuff out of the CD player"".overall, this is a very nice contribution to the exploration ofa new way of doing jazz."
4,A Real Compact Disc Of Greatest Hits,"This one is pretty good compared to a few other ""Best Of"" issues. Still a good one for the casual fan but by no means a substitute for a REAL best of collection (save that for ""This Is The Moody Blues"", Anthology & Gold). If your not sure about The Moody Blues & want just a solid collection on one CD, this one is the ticket.search ""Judemac Forever"" on msn,yahoo or google."
2,Remastered????,"I remember listening to the Moody Blues on radio years ago and really liked them. When I saw this CD, and that is was remastered, I thought it would be really good (isn't remastered supposed to mean improved???). What a huge disappointment! The first song, ""Go Now"", is the worst, sounding tinny and scratchy, nothing like I remember. The others aren't quiet as bad, but the quality just isn't there. This is poorly remastered. If you want Moody Blues music, listen to samples of their other CD's first. This one is terrible."
5,Wonderful compilation; pleasantly surprised!,"I'm one of those people who LOVES music, but never know what or who I'm listening to! It's sad... I purchased this CD for the song ""Your Wildest Dreams"" as it reminded me of a guy I dated in high school that I hadn't seen in 34 years. I was pleasantly surprised; there were so many of my favorite songs. Songs that I just LOVED to dance to; dancing was my passion. About 3 months after purchasing the CD, the fellow came back into my life. We're now married. He too had the CD, for the same song, because of me."
3,"This ""best of"" is not the best","I already owned ""Legend of a Band"" but my son ""borrowed"" it and I had to replace. I bought this CD because it had some extra songs. It's OK but some of the remix is not that hot. Also, they don't include ""Late Lament"" at the end of ""Nights in White Satin"" and I keep missing the expected ""Breath deep, the gathering gloom..."""
5,Great Hits,I have always enjoyed The Moody Blues music! This is a great collection of some of their biggest hits. Enjoy
4,The Best of the Moody Blues,This CD contained an excellent version of the track I was searching for (Forever Autumn) and I was pleasently surprised with the rest of the content. The parcel arrived faster than expected and in very good condition. Thank you.
1,Embarrassing,"Have been a Moody Blues fan forever and I must say this is the worse repo of their music. The first cut ""Go Now"" wasn't even recognizable as their music much less them. And the CD didn't get much better with the ""editing"" and terrible reproduction. It reminded me of a ""K Mart"" knock off, back when they did recordings."
4,Nostalgia Buffs Rejoice,"The first time I heard the Moody Blues was their first record. The local Top Forty DJ remarked at the time that he predicted a long and memorable life for this group. At the time, I thought that was an odd comment to make for a good but not earth shaking song. Was I wrong! I have been a Moody Blues fan since then. Over the years, I have had albums that have been borrowed and never returned, or even stolen. Each time, I have gone out to replace them. This CD incarnation is a wonderful review of all my years of listening pleasure. I wish a few others were added, but all in all, a pleasing collection."
4,Good!,Sound was good. A really good CD to listen to when you are in a laid back-folksy kind of mood. The Moody Blues should have a wider fan base than they do. They had a lot more good songs other than Knights In White Satin.
1,The Best of Moody Blues review by George,"I am a great fan of the Moody Blues and have always enjoyed their concerts. When I saw this CD ""The Best of Moody Blues"", I ordered it. Although it contains their hits, the recording does not meet the quality or sound of other CDs by the Moody Blues. Their CD at Red Rock is still one of their best."
2,Don't waste your money if your a true Moody Blues fan,"I bought this CD over the weekend and listened to it on the way to work this morning and what I found wasn't really thier best work but the edited down versions and re-done versions of some of thier classic songs. The biggest let down was ""Nights in White Satin"" which anyone that knows there was 2 version released. The one on the CD was the radio play version. The other is the same except before the last refrain thier is a poem down by the lead singer. All this then becomes is a great way to introduce your friends into what a great group the Moody Blues are. Hopefully they will release a true Best of CD with the originals on;y remastered for digital quailty and not just completly re-cut. Along with issuing the versions of thier songs that everyone likes."
1,Moody Blues cd -,"Poor Quality! First two tracks don't play. Others are mediocre!!! Either false advertising or a 'singular' bad cd!???? I've ordered from company before and been satisfied. But, this one didn't.. Not blaming company I ordered from, but whomever made the recording...."
1,Not a good representation,"The Moody Blues are best listened to with their concepts going all together, and their songs not being edited like crazy to make them out to seem like a pop band. They were not a pop band at all. If you think The Moody Blues are good after listening to this try listening to Days Of Future Passed, and you will realize what they really were musical Geniuses!"
5,best one to buy,if you want to own only one moody blues albumn...this is it...you will listen and listen and listen...caution....don't drive and listen too much....you might close your eyes at the wrong time....definately a stress reliever especially for an ex-l.a. freeway driver like me...
1,I think I'm going to be sick.....,"The Sailor Scouts themselves would keel over if they seen these DVD's of the first season coming out. We should be getting the first of the Sailor Moon season the same way we are getting Sailor Moon S & Sailor Moon Super S. The episodes on the second DVD should be:7. Usagi/Serena reconsiders! The way to stardom is tuff.8. Is the genius girl a monster? The brain-washing cram school.9. Usagi's/Serena's misfortune! Beware of the rushing clock.10. The cursed bus! The fighter of flames, Mars, appears.11. Usagi/Serena & Rei face off? The nightmare of dreamland.12. I want a boyfriend too. Trap of the cruise ship.With this DVD's release we are missing 3 episodes. By the time all the Sailor Moon season 1 DVD's are released a total of 6 episodes will never be seen. To make it worse is one of the episodes skipped is the next to last episode.I would advise against getting the first season Sailor Moon DVD set. Tape the show off TV. You'll be getting the EXACT same thing."
3,More from Sailor Moon,"The first DVDs of Sailor Moon series 1 are edited and are dubbed English only, a huge disappointment for fans who, up until now, have been given a choice of original japanese language with english subtitles and the English dub on an uncut DVD edition.These edited dubbed DVDs could go up until Sailor Moon epsiode 80 (The end of the Sailor Moon R series) or hopefully before then they will stop making the simply edited dub version and expand into bilingual uncut.Thankfully episodes 81 onwards are the uncut bilingual DVDs that are already available for purchase.I can only hope that the producers of the uncut DVDs will be the ones who (if) get the rights to produce Sailor Moon: SailorStars, the last series which hasn't been translated at all."
2,Hunter's other book is better,"The author appears to not have known what kind of book she wanted this to be and opted, unfortunately, for a brief history of Asia, going back centuries, instead of a tightly packed account of the killer disease in the world's most populated continent. Hunter's previous work, the excellent Black Death: AIDS in Africa, provided readers with an armful of information about AIDS, WHO, treatment, government policies, etc. The mission of this book was to focus on the feminine perspective, and provide some personal insights from infected people. In that respect, it was helpful. The bulk of the text, however, literally recounts dozens of pages of political and social history of minimal pertinence to either AIDS or other diseases generally, taking `background' information to an unnecessary extreme. This book would have been far better with these parts edited out, even at the cost of producing a much thinner volume"
1,Doesn't even deserve one star!!! **AVOID**,"To be honest, I went into this movie believing it was the ""Hitcher"" which I take responsibility for that as being my fault. So given that, I was expecting a lot. The first two lines of the movie made me realize I had just purchased probably one of the worst low budget movies ever to have been created. The acting was TERRIBLE!! The worst part was the sound quality. No lie, I had to learn how to read lips. I had the volume up full blast and there were times, I could not hear a word that was said. I want to know how this film could be sold! Overall, I would have fell asleep on it, but it was so bad I wanted to see if it could get any worse! Well, it never let me down in that aspect. Take the first review with a grain of salt, as the reviewer must have been the writer himself. Avoid like the plague!"
3,TIME TO RETIRE............,"I'VE BEEN A FAN OF FREDDY FENDER FOR MORE THAN 30 YEARS AND LOVE HIS STYLE OF MUSIC. THAT SAID, I THINK ITS TIME FOR FREDDY TO RETIRE.AS AGE AND HEALTH ISSUES BECOME MORE THAN JUST CONVERSATION ONE HAS TO DO SOME SELF REFLECTING ON ONES ABILITIES TO PERFORM AT A MINIMUM STANDARD. AFTER VIEWING THIS DVD, I CAME AWAY WITH THE IMPRESSION THAT ITS A CASE OF YOUR MIND MAKING A PROMISE THAT YOUR BODY CAN'T FILL. ON THIS DVD FREDDY CAN HARDLY SING.HIS HEALTH ISSUES HAVE TAKEN THEIR TOLL ON HIS VOICE. THE SHOW IS JUST OK. IF ITS FREDDY YOU WANT, THEN BUY THE TEXAS TORNADOS LIVE IN AUSTIN. THERE IS ENOUGH FREDDY IN HIS HEYDAY TO KEEP YOU SMILIN'."
2,BEWARE Defective magnet hanger,"I bought this to replace my worn out oven glove and because I liked the pattern (ergo 2 stars instead of 1). However, the magnetic hanger does not work at all and they had to know that -- can't hold the weight. So product is misrepresented as described. I haven't used it yet to see if it is really protective against heat."
4,"Nice, not boring, but still not perfect :)","I read this book as part of my Sorbonne II exams literature study. At first, I thought it was going to bore me, and leave me all the way uninterested, mainly because I wasn't so keen on this type of literature, and because it seemed too long. But reading it was after all quite a nice experience! I found it wasn't boring, it kept me up, wanting to find out what happens next, although not all the time! :) Interesting because we learn so much about its theme (involving the status of Africa half a century ago). Interesting also, of a literary fashion; I, at least, found it fun to analyse it in class! It wouldn't get 5 stars because, well, it didn't exactly blow my skirt up, neither would it get 3 stars cause it just was more interesting than 3 out of 5!"
1,Prepare yourselves folks...,"For ""Nemesis 2."" This doozy of an action film lives up to the solitary blurb on the front of the box, ""Made in Canada."" Perhaps this fact is responsible for the incorrect grammar and poor spelling (not to mention inaccuracy) of the explanation on the back. [...]However, seeing as these are all false, ""Nemesis 2"" is a seemingly random jumble of footage strung together with perhaps a grand total of 25 lines of poorly written dialogue. I would have liked to seen the script for this movie, as I imagine it would have fit neatly onto one sheet of looseleaf paper. If you can quell the rising urge to vomit that this movie induces, you are in for one of the wildest, most non-sensical, watered-down action movies that you'll ever see. ""Nemesis 2"" is a definate don't-miss for fans of the ""bad B-movie"" genre. It earns every star of its one-star rating. [...]"
5,"beautiful chain, great price","Bought it for my graduation class pin, which can also be a pendant. Lovely, and I can get it in just the right length for dir cheap!"
1,dnt buy!!!,I will keep the review simple and straight to the point...the chain is not worth buying. I bought it and it turned grey in a week and a half. It looks great but tarnishes quickly. Purchase it at your own expense.
2,to easely bent,"i took it out to look at itthen put it back in its packagingthe next time it was looked at it had started to have some small bendswhen worn it""s hardly noticabletobe attractive"
1,Cheap,"Necklace broke just after a day, not repairable. Wore with a locket on the end, when I bent over the necklace broke near the clasp but not the clasp itself."
5,Happy Bird gets to go outside,My bird is scared of alot of things but it didn't take me to long to get her to let me put it on her. She still thinks if I turn my head she can try to take a nibble out of the harness but with enough training she will stop I'm sure of it. There is not a whole lot of room for adjustments to make it fit your bird just right but it will still hold.
2,"Too much history, overall a good book but...","I bought this book thinking that the author would focus much more on ""common"" people who love to be alone with their thoughts, hobbies, etc... but after some pages, the author lost track of what he was talking about and started talking about famous writers, scientists, physicists, psychologists, etc... and focused entirely on the lives of those people that lived centuries ago. I expected more for a book that talked about Solitude in a day-to-day approach not so much history. But that's ok, overall, a good book, easily readable, interesting and with some useful information."
2,Solitude as an artistic inspiration,"I was hoping for a book that looked into the psychological aspects of solitude for people in general.This book gives a selected account of how differnt artists have been inspired by being alone.While this may be interesting to some, i got no real insight into why ordinary people choose solitude or its different aspects."
3,A psychological analysis of the capacity for solitude,"""Solitude: A return to self"" is a misleading title for this book. It should be something more along the lines of ""Solitude: A psychological investigation"". 90% of the books consists of discussions of Freud, Jung, and other phsyco-analysts and their views and arguments on various topics the author tries to tie together to articulate the benefit solitude can provide as well as show that the ability to be alone shows a certain level of mental health and maturity. I found the last chapter to be the most compelling and the one that articulated the benefits that many have found in solitude. The price makes it worth the purchase, but it is not a keeper. I would check the local library to see if they have a copy. Most of the read is a bit of a struggle (this is coming from someone with a philosophy degree).Happy reading"
2,weak sauce!,"Danny is alright but there is way better djs on global undergound(sasha, digweed, nick warren)"
2,"ok if you like deep, dark, house","I bought this album because I have liked almost every Global Underground album Ive bought. This one in particular i didnt like, because none of the beats broke it was just too steady for me."
4,You can almost smell it!!,"The DJ's Dj, Mr Danny Tenaglia is a master of a musical journey and is the finest Dj I have ever seen live. However the two and a half hours of CD space do not do justice to a man capable of 10 hour sets (I would describe this album as a 2 day car journey from coast to coast done by concorde). There are some stunning Tracks on it though, Yves Deruyter's 'Feel Free' and his own 'Music is the Answer' immediately springs to mind. It is full of deep, dark basslines and all sorts of technical wizardry. The effects are superb, The Djing incredible, and it immediately transports you to a dank club somewhere (if you turn off the lights in the room!). I would highly recommend this if you want to get to know what makes one DJ any different from another. It is quite unlike anything you'll hear in a long time. Just wait 'til you hear about poor Frank Sinatra!!"
4,Good house,"I've bought this double cd, and after some listened i like it very much.Cd 1 contains house music that are very groovy, whereas cd 2 contains a more fast and angry house music.This cd was based on a ""live"" of Denny Tenaglia in Athens, that was a very breakthrough, so this cd are part of story of the house music too.I recomend the buy."
5,Hold on and enjoy the ride!,"Danny Tenaglia's dark style and deep rythms on disc one pounds your soul into oblivion. Disc two is a bit more main-stream but still deep and soulfull. If you love deep, hard house, you will love this set. To Danny, much love!"
1,A let down for Global Underground,"being from the US, I have only been privy to the first 5 of the Global Underground CDs. Digweed, Oakenfold, Sasha, and Nick Warren blew me away. The beats were fantastic and I can't stop listening to them. However, Danny boy let me down. The entire first disk sounds like one song with no break beats for much of anything else to emerse your mind in. A horrible set to dance to or to even let your party goers hear you have. Keep your beans and cubes away from this one. If you love the magic of Gatecrasher Wet or anything spun off of Oakenfold, do your self a favor and NEVER PICK THIS CD UP. Tenaglia's attempt at GU sucks."
5,Phenomenal journey through tribal/house and trance!,"Mr. Tenaglia has outdone himself! This journey is the closest I have heard to his marathon live sets; the first and most amazing one I heard was at Black & Blue in Montreal in October, '97. He sweeps you in a huge circle, as the songs weave in a seamless manner. HOUSY but SMOOTH, DEEP yet GENTLE at the same time! Not a reckless trainride, but passionately orchestrated with some unexpected surprises to keep you wide awake, as you flow through his dreamy HouseScape. Disc one is deeper dub-style House. Disc Two is prettier tribal/trance style House, similar to the Ibiza style that so may DJ's have gravitated to. Simply put, Danny blows you away in his mixing style using various rhythms, but more importantly, the melody line rules with an impeccable choice of songs!!! Two STELLAR songs getting lots of club play are Feel This, and Cool Kids of Death. Thank you, Danny, for that magical introduction in Montreal."
5,"Deep, Dark party slaming tracks!","I have all of the other global underground CD's and I must say that this is my absolute favorite. Dark house at it's fullest, it's as if it was recorded straight from an underground party. I'm going to have the tribal beats in my mind for years. If your in the mood to find you ""lost associate"" in the deepest depths of house then this is the CD for you!"
3,Cig lighter ext cord,Everything is fine w/it other than we found out we actually had to either hold in on the cord which we plugged into the ext cord or push it in and then tape it on tight. Not what I wanted to do.
4,Prettier in person,These carsters do the trick of absorbing moisture in car cup holders - very handy. I chose the wolf pattern because I'm fond of wolves although the photo of the wolf wasn't too appealing. I was pleasantly surprised - it's prettier than I expected.
1,Do not recommend buying this pillow,"It barely has any beads in it and it tears so very easy. Also, overpriced. You can get the same pillow in stores for only 3 dollars. Don't waste your money."
4,Timex Men's Metal Field Expedition Watch - Not too shabby,"This is a handsome watch. The picture makes the face look fairly silver in color, while it is truly a dark grey, almost black metal. It's a great fitting watch and the strap is pretty solid quality. The only complaint I have (why I didn't rate this 5 stars) is that the 'ticking' of the second hand is VERY loud; I can hear it from different rooms (sounds more like a wall clock). Once you get used to it, it's not a big deal...just something to be aware of."
3,Caution - Not color shown,"Though this is no doubt a great watch, it's not the gray, brushed metal finish as shown on amazon or on the Timex website. The case is black, which in my opinion changes the whole look of the watch. I read some reviews where folks like the black; for me, it doesn't work. I don't know if there was a switch at some time, but come on, how hard is it to change the picture??"
1,Don't waste your Timex,"I bought this watch at a Timex store a few months ago for a travel time piece. Within a week or two I dropped it on a soft surface and the rear metal case cove popped open! I brought to the store and the clerk was trying to blame me. I finally told him I have had watches that have been through wars and have never had the rear case pop off. He finally have me the new watch same model, though he treated me like I was stupid.I happen to be in the 'business', so I doubt this is the case. Two weeks later I had my watch off sitting on the drier. It fell 4 feet onto a rug, and you guessed it, the rear case cover popped off. It was lucky I had a witness for the first incident. The salesman actually pressed the rear case cover back on and dropped it on the floor and gave it back to me, telling me it didn't pop off. no refund of course for faulty design. So I ponied up another pile of dosh for a Timex T49618, screw in rear case cover good for 200 meters. No surprises after 24 hrs......"
2,"Looks great, works horrible","When I got it in the mail, I loved it. It looks great and fit wonderful. However, the time ""slows"" down every week. I thought maybe I turned the knob or something, but it does it every week. It's not bad, only an hour behind but it is a pain in the butt to have to fix it every week."
3,Small Date Window,The Timex T47012 watch was pretty much what I expected. It is a good looking watch with nice detail. The only shortcoming I see at this point is the very small window for the date with numbers that are equally very small.
4,Good dependable time keeper,"Good solid watch. Date window too small but for the price, you usually don't get that anyway. Had Timex Expeditions before and they do what they need you to do. Tell time and keep on ticking. Indiglo great feature."
5,An excellent choice for the budget minded practical shopper,"I took a long time to find a simple, inexpensive watch that tells time and glows. When I saw this on my next-door neighbor's wrist, I had ordered it within a half-hour. It's a great watch. The band is strong, the numbers clear; only criticism, the date is near impossible to read. (I must be getting older!). An excellent choice for the budget minded practical shopper."
5,Basic good looks,"This Timex arrived as advertised and is a no frills timepiece. The price was right, including shipping, and the size and features are perfect for business casual attire - I wear mine to work almost everyday."
1,Not worth my money,"The quality of pillow cover is okay, but the pillow itself is too stiff, and definitely not worth my money. Not even close to a quality synthetic down that you can easily find from premium bedding brands. I don't see any difference between Premium Comforel Down and the regular one (Synthetic Fiber Filler), which Comforel Down is supposed to be superior. Perhaps I should have invested extra $$$ and bought Natural Goose Down Filler instead of this bulky, cheap one."
1,"Too thick, too stiff!",This pillow is nothing like it looks in the photos. It is stuffed so much it is simply too firm to cuddle up with. It's like an overstuffed tube! Also the included pillow case shrinks when washed and dried making it nearly impossible to put on the the pillow and once on it makes the pillow even stiffer being that it is stuffed into a pillow case that is too small. I am far from pleased with this purchase and now have to go through the hassle of returning it :(
1,"love the pillow - this case, not so much","I absolutely love the pillow, and rate it a 5. However, the pillowcase that came with it left much to be desired, and I'm assuming this is the same case. After only two washings in cold water, and two trips through the dryer on Low, it had shrunk so much that it actually straightened out the pillow when I struggled through putting it on for the third time. I've had to switch to using two king-sized pillowcases, which leaves a lot of loose fabric around the curved end, until I have time to tailor one of the cases to fit the curve. Quite a disappointment, but at least the pillow itself is still something I love."
5,"Snoozer Dream Weaver Full Body Pillowcase, White","Snoozer Dream Weaver Full Body Pillowcase, White is fit with Snoozer Full Body Pillow Hypoallergenic Synthetic Fiber Filler. My wife loves it. Thanks a lot."
5,Love this pillow!,I bought this to replace a cheap small body pillow and it is everything I hoped it would be. I use just this pillow now with no other pillows. It solves several of my old sleeping pains; including neck pain and lower back from sleeping on my side. I've been using it for about 3 months and plan to get another as a back up. Highly recommend.
4,historian,"This is an excellent treatment of the origins of the Indo-Europeans and together with Cavalli-Sforza's ""Genes,Peoples and Languages"" provides where from and at what time period the ancesters of the Europeans originated. Renfrew's only inaccuracy is in infering that at the time of the arrival of the first agriculturalists to the Balkans a Greek association be made. Cavalli-Sforza puts forward a more factual and convincing identifcaton of the language of Albania being the oldest in Europe. These two books present when examined together the most convincing arguments on the topic in particular since they base there presentations on either radio-carbon dating in the case of agriculture or on genes in the case of dating who are the oldest people of Europe."
2,"Yawn, another Diane Warren ballad","As with How Can I Live, I Turn To You, Because You Loved Me, and I Don't Want to Miss A Thing, we have yet another love ballad from the pen of uber-successful pop-songwriter Diane Warren.Problem is we've heard this all before. Warren's lyrics are so vague she could be writing about her pet poodle or favorite ice cream. Supposedly this song was written for the soundtrack of the Jesus mini-series, but it's not really religous. ""I need you like the sun, the rain"" -- gosh, that's original!Want a real love song? Check out Lee Ann Womack's ""I Hope You Dance"". If you can sit that song without getting a lump in your throat, you're not human."
3,"One of the best ballads I've ever heard, but...","LeAnn is extremely talented, and this song is so beautiful. But i agree with the music lover from N. Carolina, her video is anything but spiritual. She's definetly trying way way way tooo hard to go for a bad girl, britney, pop, image. I'd wish the video was something else, maybe her praying, instead of licking her lips. Song is great though, you can't stop listening to it. I'm just so dissappointed in LeAnn though."
2,What LeAnn really heeds...,"This song was written for a mini series on Jesus Christ, and LeAnn is presented to the Pope. Then a video is made with LeAnn mpoving sesually around. One has no clue from the video of the object of her need. Now the song is just another POWER-LOVE-BALLAD on pop-rock stations. Now we also have LeAnn dancing on a bar in a soft-porn teen flick! What LeAnn really ""needs"" are record sales and fame! LeAnn is very talented and has a etrong voice, but why must she sing to the point of almost screaming as the song gets intense? No, she has a lomg way to go before reaching Patsy Cline-Celine Dion-Barbara Streisand status."
2,Lots of errors,"There are lots of errors in the code listings in this book, as well as a lot of typos in the text. This is not just annoying, but quite confusing. The concepts are explained well enough, but the errors really get in the way."
1,RECIEVED BROKEN,It took long enough to arrive. and when i finally got it i opened it up ( very cheap packaging ) a whole bunch of styrophome and tape. BOTH were extremely cracked.never ordering from these people again.
2,Lightweight,"I'd say that ""lightweight"" best describes this book. There's precious little here that you can't find in other, better books on the topic, but it does seem to hit the minimum information you'd expect from an XHTML book. It's almost as if this were meant to be a larger book, but portions were cut; it's physically smaller than nearly any other book on this topic.While size certainly isn't the primary consideration for a book's quality, it may be reflective of a lack of completeness -- and I believe it's true in this case. The author seems competent enough with the material, but there is not much to recommend this peculiarly lightweight book over others on the same topic."
3,Interesting read...but very repetitive and slow...,This book was of interesting subject matter but seemed to be repetitive and dragging. The information could have been presented in half as many pages. An interesting read if you have a lot of spare time.
4,Valuable source of gay veterans' stories,"The value of this book lies in its compilation of first-person, firsthand stories from WWII veterans about being gay or lesbian and in the service during the worst war ever fought. From how they answered the single psych screening question at induction: ""Do you like girls?""; to the gleeful sneaking around in basic or on base; to the heartbreaking stories of lovers losing each other on the battlefield, and the shocking humanity of straight comrades who found out; to the awfulness of being outed and the shame of the blue discharge--the vets' stories make this book worthwhile. When the book delves deep into policy discussions, or asserts its thesis that the GLBT experience in WWII helped structure the gay liberation movement of a generation later, it loses impact. Still, a worthwhile and necessary addition to any library about gay history, or World War II."
3,For Dylan not bad,Blowin in the wind may be the Folkies only good tune everhe is just terrible and for 1963 Losers that were beat upby the Football teams back in the day that were cool.
2,Guess this one doesn't do it for me,"I thought I was more of a Dylan fan, but I guess not. I know that a few of his hits are great, but this disc will be in the rummage sale."
5,It's NEVER too late!,"When people say Bob Dylan's songs are timeless, they are so right. We always had an album to two on hand, but felt that we needed to ""complete"" the collection. Now in our 60's, we're getting more out of his songs than ever before. These lyrics were so important when they were new, but they haven't lost anything in the 30 to 40 years since. Can't believe we never had this album, yet we know most of the songs by heart. It's a treat to hear the original verions of each one. The only usual complaint is that the lyrics are never included on any of Dylan's albums. Bought the lyrics book ""Bob Dylan yrics 1962 - 2001"" and it is pure literature itself, but also a good companion to his albums. As one reviewer said, this is a beautiful album to listen to anytime, anywhere."
5,Early Dylan saved,"This brought me back to the time I was a Dj at WKDK in Newberry, South Carolina. The 33 record came in, I played it and was told to put it on the back shelf. To controversial for the time and place. I ended up with the record and played it until 33's faded out. Over the years I remembered that record and often wished I could play it again and then I found the CD on Amazon. The CD is exactly as I remember the record but a better quality. Anyone interested in the early Dylan and that time period should really get this CD, only to hear how Blowing in the Wind originally sounded before Joan Baez and Peter, Paul and Mary made it popular."
5,First glimpse of Dylan the songwriter,"The public was exposed to the genius of Dylan's early folk writings in this album, and the results are phenomenal. It's hard to imagine the 60's without this album, as many cuts became classics. If you are intersted in Dylan's folk phase, start here."
3,"Warm Atmosphere, Some Very Meaningful Songs","Bob Dylan's second record, The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan, displays an intimate warmth. It mostly consists of just Bob Dylan singing and accompanying himself on guitar and harmonica. Many of the songs take on a political stance. After a while that can be a bit trying especially on some of the long and winding numbers(Bob Dylan's Dream, Talking World War III Blues, A Hard Rain's A Gonna Fall).There are some interesting strumming stylings most particularly on Down The Highway and Corrina, Corrina. The lyrics are quite captivating on such favorites as Blowin' In The Wind, Honey, Just Allow Me One More Chance, and Don't Think Twice, It's All Right.Diehard fans and lovers of acoustic folk rock should check this one out. As for me, I can recognize the beauty in several of the songs. I just fine the all acoustic format and Bob Dylan's whiny voice a little trying. But it certainly stands on its merits."
5,I'm happy with the product I have acquired!,"The quality of sound is very good.I like Bob Dylan.. some songs in this album I had not in CD.Yes, I would recommend for everybody like something well produced.Sorry, I'm a brazilian one and I have difficult write in you language without using Google, Babylon, etc.!Ok! Thanks to all team of Amazon.Carlos, Rio de Janeiro"
2,Five star album presented in a two star format,"Why MFSL opted for the stereo mix is a mystery. Great choice for those who want to listen to this LP with vocals in the center, the guitar way over in the right corner and the harmonica in the left. This isn't a remix either so there are still many instances of the voice whipping over from left to centre at the end of harmonica solos and vice versa. A quick comparison with the far cheaper Hybrid SACD released almost ten years ago shows that the MFSL disc has more compression applied - another example of the CD loudness war. The mono mix - now easily obtainable - is far superior and natural sounding and that was what Dylan and his engineers and producer had in mind when the LP was recorded, stereo mixes were a knocked-out loaded afterthought for 'hi-fi buffs' and would remain so for several more years. One listen to this and it's easy to hear why, best avoided."
1,Fell apart - This item is garbage,"After trying to screw this cable into my tv, the screw head detached from the cable and I just had a wire sticking out of the wire. This item is garbage save your dollar."
3,Did the job,Worked as needed&expected. Only a cable so NO ned to throw a special party over the result of a cable wire.
3,"it's okay, and it's cheap... no real complaint","There was no indication of manufacturer, so I have to just trust that it's RCA. In any event, the inner connectors arrived bent on both ends, and the screw threading was usuable but not smooth. All that said, it works, it was cheap, and all's fine.I agree with Georgia Dude's comment that if you make a permanent connection, okay, but if you intend to be connecting and disconnecting, do yourself a favor and get something with better hardware."
2,Needed constant adjusting,"It worked, I guess that's a plus. I have 65 channels in my dorm room and the cable would work perfectly for only half of the channels at one time. I had to keep readjusting the cable, often times using other objects to hold it in place. It works, but you can do so much better."
2,End falls off,One of the ends fell off of one of the cables while installing. Will be returning for a refund. Wouldn't have thought the RCA brand cable would have been like this.
2,Poor quality cable,"This cable stopped working properly after a day of use. Unlike my other RG-6 cables, the pin connector does not stick out passed the screw connector, so it is difficult to get a quality connection on my cable box and television."
1,Poor Signal Performance,"By far the majority of RCA cabling products/accessories are of excellent quality. I absolutely love their 2.4GHz splitters. Unfortunately these particular ""RG6"" cables are completely useless. I had purchased two, so this is not a case of just one of them being bad. They are both equally lousy.They can barely handle OTA digital ATSC or analog NTSC signals admirably. Channels that would tune easily prior were completely dropped. There was noticeable signal loss + RF interference with those that still managed to tune.You will be sorely disappointed if you plan on using these for digital satellite, cable, or cable modem.I have an old 80's era Radio Shack 6' length of RG-59 which outperforms these in every regard. Sad but oh so true. ""RG6"" spec cabling my backside.Pitiful."
5,Why pay big dollars when you can buy these and still get the same quality!,"I read all the reviews, bought them and am sooooooooooooo happy that I did!! Exactly what the big stores and brands sell, but at a minor fraction of the cost!!"
1,Screw in is needlesly hard to screw in,I have connected to my televisions numerous cables that when you are taking in screw in and out easily..This one you have to grip with plyers to get it to go in..I did It by hand a few times and it does go in but what a hassle.Verizon came and installed cable in my home and the ones they brought worked effortlessly..The tech installer said to me and he was rehooking the ones up he didnt bring how diificult it was for him to turn them .I would look elsewhere for a cable.If your going to leave it on for years and years than maybe its ok.
1,You get what you pay for...,"Not trying to beat a dead horse into the ground by saying it, but these cables are cheap for a reason. The end of one of 'em snapped right off while we were trying to screw it on, and they provided poor signal when installed (even the ones that didn't snap off of course; no sense counting a broken cord in a performance review). Channels flickered in and out or don't show on the TV's scan at all. They even felt cheap, and I'm not sure how that happens with something as simple as a coaxial cable. Save your money to buy better quality cords."
1,Worst Cable Ever. Do NOT Buy. Connectors fall apart.,"I read the negative reviews, but bought it anyway because of the price. In fact, I bought two. Now I have sent two back to Amazon. The problem is that the F-connectors are terrible. When you screw them down - just as they begin to tighten up - the screw ring pulls off of the wire itself and the whole thing falls apart. You are unable to tighten the screw onto the threads to make the connection.Just trust me.Don't buy this.It is junk that will not work.I bought two.Both broke when I first tried to attach them."
1,Poor signal,"I use this co-ax to connect a brand new standard flat screen TV to cable service. The signal was poor and because the cable and TV were new, I though it was the signal. The cable service technician solved the problem by replacing the cable.So I am down the price of the cable, shipping and a $50 technician's fee.Don't buy this cable."
2,Cheap but cheap,"It didn't cost much so I can't complain or say I didn't expect it, but it never really worked at 100%. It had fuzzy quality and would tamper to static a lot, and eventually after about a week it died. It's a cheap cable so I can't say I didn't get my moneys worth, but I wouldn't recommend it to anybody."
2,Love this show!,So I bought this used and I understand that means there might be some wear to it and if boughten items from gohastings before almost all were used but this was really worn torn up on the inside and some of the discs are pretty scratched up I hope they work also it's missing some of the inside artwork I'm kind of disappointed in this
2,This album is awful,"This is nothing like Glitz or Excursions. It sounds like something that I could have made at home with my computer. It is definitely not house music, and is borderline techno. It can't even be chillout because some of it is just so discordant. Save your money for his next lp."
3,Cheesiness galore!,"Hey, we all like those kiddy movies packed to the brim with special effects, rockets, and lame little love stories. And this is the very epitome of all that. While you will laugh ruefully at many of the terrible attempts at jokes, the story never actually gets boring--although there are a couple of plot holes and sometimes the story makes no sense whatsoever.Main reason to see this movie: Sophia Myles and the dude who plays her butler. Myles plays Lady Penelope (also ""Lady P""), a British woman who seems to enjoy helping the ThunderBirds. She and her manservant are really the only people worth watching in this film, as they manage to be funny and she manages to come off as a complete girly girl and a sharp fighter at the same time. Kudos!So grab the popcorn and the kids, and try not to snicker too much while they enjoy this fun little flick."
3,fun,"the movie sticks but otherwise good fun the movie is true to the show.no explaition offered an what happen to ""brains"" son's mom which i thought was lame."
4,Thunderbirds are GO,"I saw this movie with my camp group of 12 year old girls.Walking into the theater, I figured they'd hate it.They didn't.I loved it even more than they did.This is not an intellectual film, it's not going to make you think. It is, however, a fun, fast-paced, summer movie.About two minutes into the movie, you know how it's going to end. That doesn't stop you enjoying it.It's cheesy, campy and predictable...and it knows it. It's not trying too hard, and it's not taking itself seriously.The movie took all of the charm and style of the marionette TV series, and took it the big screen in live action perfectly.Wonderful."
4,"Thunderbirds ""The Ford Movie""","I went to see the film on saturday night. I realy enjoyed the film and i think all the reviews are a bit harsh.The animation was very good apart from the titles at the start, too long and didnt have the essance of the origional TV show. The movie looked reasonably realistic (well if you could call it that).The thing that did spoil it a bit was the Thunderbirds The Ford Movie. Ford was plastered over every car in the film. all the cars especially the police cars in the london scene were ford. I have never noticed this in a movie before.But I would recommend going to watch it its s good watch and i will probably buy the DVD."
4,Little boys will love this movie!,"I've seen the original series and can understand the complaints of die hard fans. However, my 4 yo son loves this movie!! He also loves the original Thunderbirds. He would probably give it 5 stars! I thought the movie was just plain fun, but of course not Oscar material. As a mom, I loved Lady Penelope and her pink car! If you have little boys, they will love this movie!"
2,LOIN DE L'ESPRIT DE LA SERIE,"Attention, oui, tout les thunderbirds sont present mais vraiment trop peu de sauvetage. Pourquoi faut il toujours des super enfants pour tout sauver? Le debut du film m'a excité et ensuite ca tombe à plat si vous avez dans la trentaine vous serez decu."
3,"If you're a guy, read this review","There is a scene in this movie where the character, Lady Phenelopie gets locked into a meat freezer room. In that scene, it appears that the frigid temperature has had an embarrassing effect on her ""upper body"".If you look closely, you'll notice something ""different"" about her shirt. It could just be the material in her shirt, but I don't think it's the material."
2,THUNDERBIRDS Lacks Wings,"Anthony Edwards should have stuck with ER. Although this film is directed toward families, THUNDERBIRDS never seems to get off the ground. Bill Paxton finds himself trapped in space once again, and it's up to his son and two other kids to not just rescue him and his other sons, but to prevent a madman (Ben Kingsley) from robbing banks. The graphics are extremely well done, but the acting is ghastly and the storyline just isn't exciting enough. Although all of the kids and most of the parents declared their satisfaction after the movie ended, I failed to hear the usual banter among the kids on what their favorite scenes were. I got the feeling that they were happy that they got to go to the movie, but they won't be asking for the DVD for Christmas. If you are a parent and are hoping to find a movie that will stimulate both you and your kids, stick with the SPIDER-MAN and SHREK sequels. Leave THUNDERBIRDS at the docking bay."
1,Drivel pure and simple drivel,Ok the TV series was totally pathetic ..Davey and Goliath was far more entertaining than this thing and the transition to movie and DVD was no less pathetic..it was cookie cutter predictable and totally one dimentional..whoever gave this thing 5 stars totally neds to have a personality implanted and save themselves the trouble of having to think or feel forthemselves..
1,BOTTOM 10 MOVIES OF ALL TIME,"ACTING: A JOKEDIRECTING: AMATEURISHRESPECT FOR ORIGINAL CONCEPT/ERA: TOTALLY ABSENTWORST ASPECT: LADY PENELOPE'S CLASS IS TRASHEDSUMMATION: A METAPHOR FOR THE TRASHING OF THE HUMAN MIND AND SPIRIT BY 50 YEARS OF FEMINIZING PESTICIDES AND DUMBING-DOWN HEAVY METALS, RENDERING MORONS GETTING PAID AS ACTORS TO VERBALLY AND PHYSICALLY ABUSE EACH OTHER, RESULTING IN THIS TOTAL PIECE OF GARBAGE, DEVOID OF ANY RESEMBLANCE TO THE SPIRIT AND GODLINESS OF THE TRACY FAMILY AND GERRY ANDERSON'S LEGACY.ONE MORE ITEM FOR A LANDFILL."
1,Oh dear,"You have to review this film without reference to the tv series, there is so much different about it and obviously it was aimed at a completely different audience, but there are some basic things you would expect: at least one set piece rescue, the Tracy brothers working as a family, cool or at least surprising technology and some kind of excitement.Instead we get a lot of obnoxious kids running round an island, lots of frantic noise, some very iffy and careless effects, a lot of stars who should have known better.The writers obviously had no new ideas, some of the characters, especially Brains, are rather offensive, and it's boring! At least the Tracys had sense to be stranded in the space station for most of the film."
4,It was worth it.,"As a watcher of the original tv show, I found the movie brought back through visual shots, an a few puns here an there. old an pleasant memories, But was it a great movie ,no. but seeing certain actors an the old memories, it was worth buying an watching, more than once i will add, a good value it was . to me."
2,Wrong dimensions listed (i.e. Not what I ordered),"I ordered the universal camera bag because the dimensions read: ""Product Dimensions: 5.8 x 4 x 1.8 inches"" which would make it the same size as my other bag. I wanted to have options for wearing different colored clothes (I like to match.)**ACTUAL DIMENSIONS** : 6.5 x 4.5 x 2.8 inchesThe bag is considerably larger than what I expected. My partner made me give it up for a camcorder bag instead of returning it. It is a nice bag - just not the dimensions listed at all. 1 or 1/2"" all around makes a HUGE difference when it comes to camera bags..."
2,It's perfect for an ultra compact camera!,"Just right, easy to open & close, carry on belt loop or shoulder, and the price is right! What more could you ask? (No room for accessories, though, so don't expect that...except maybe a spare battery or memory card)"
1,camera case,A nice case but too small for the digital camera I purchased. The delivery was prompt and had no problems returning the case.
5,Targus Video Case,I purchased this case for my video camera. It is quite large. My camera and all accessories fit in it. It is made of a good material and won't wear out anytime to soon. I would recommend it.
4,Christmas fun!,"This book was funny and I really really enjoyed it. At first pikachu is suppost to give a fortune telling mirror to hazel. But when pikachu breaks it he goes hasterical.Hazal fogives him of corse, and you'll have to read it to find out what happens to grampa.(hahahahaha)Then Hazal,Almond, and Pikachu are invited to jiggypuff's mansion for a chrismas party. They meet an extra cute squrtle and lots of other pokemon. Pikachu and clafariy decorate the christmas tree and squrtle trys to make friends with Almond. The pokemon have a give exchange! It's fun to see who gives what to who. And what Grampa gives! Mr.Absested with himself. Anyway I would recomend this book to anyone who loves pokemon!"
3,Pretty good.,"This is a review of the entire series. The series was pretty good. The animation was just ok. This story follows Gutz and the band of the hawk, a group of mercenaries that he is essentially forced into joining when he is beaten by Griffith. This follows the many battles they fight together assanations etc.The good: The show is pretty violent with plenty of action and fights. Gutz is a cool character and he evolves throughout the series, becomes stronger a better fighter etc.The Bad: It took me a few episodes to get into it. The animation is just so so. I wasn't too happy with one of the truths about Griffiths past. It gets quite strange at the end. The Anime show does not conclude the story. You can finish it in comic form but I never got around to it.Although more negative was outlined the show is actually pretty good, (not great) but pretty good. Worth a watch."
4,Fun and Interesting,"This series is a bit confusing in the beginning. It is very interesting with a lot of action. There are a lot of mature ideas and content which not everyone might like, but it has a very interesting and twisting plot. The characters have a complex relationship and develops in different ways which leave you wondering how they could develop. This style of anime is a bit different from which ADV or Manga or Pioneer might produce but still it seems like its going to be a good one. Hope this review is helpful"
2,hmm...where is the hip soundtrack?,"I have the DVD of Beserk. I was lured by the upbeat soundtrack of drums and choruses in the background giving that full warriordom atmosphere. It is slightly disappointing.I haven't finished the entire collection because it has just become so less interesting. Yes, there is gore and yes, there is a small guy with a big sword.There is a school of thought that promotes the necessity of a good soundtrack to propel a story foward. Try watching a horror film on mute and see how much heebie jeebies you get. Berserk accomplishes in doing the direct opposite.If you want to be shocked I would recommend Ninja Scroll. If you like a cool soundtrack (at least at the beginning) get Bubblegum Crisis. If you want great character development get Rorouni Kenshin. If you are just in the mood to sate a curious palate, then by all means get Berserk.You have been forewarned."
5,Absolutely Incredible,"When I first decided to plop my self down with some buds to watch this I wasn't expecting all too much. It is called Berserk after all-so we figured we'd be letting charadter development and plot sit second string to some high quality mindless violence. Don't misunderstand, there's violence-and plenty of it-but what makes this series so incredible is the intricate relationships between characters and an enveloping story. I can sit and watch all 25 episodes of the series in a row, and then still be completely happy to watch it all over again later. Pick this series up and I think you too will find yourself placing it amongst your favorites."
2,A lot missing...,"Unfortunately, Berserk starts strong, and gets progressive weaker. The first episode is the actual resolution of events as they stand. Much like the current Star Wars trilogy, you know what's going to happen, so where's the suspense?Although it is beautifully done, it isn't very well done. The story starts with a blast, and events get more and more repetitive until around number 18, when things get turned upside down. Again, with the ending known at the beginning, the suspense is quite minimal.At the end, things take a gruesome turn, and stops just short of the story actually getting interesting.All in all, it really should have been completed before releasing. There would be more to look forward to. It's a good view, but not a good buy."
2,It was just boring.,"I bought this DVD becuase everyone said it was awesome, or at least that it was pretty good. I was just boring. The fight scenes were always a still picture with a whosh noise and a panning camera. The characters made me feel nothing. I didn't even like any of them. The plot moved like a glacier. Buy Cowboy Bebop, buy X, buy Samurai X, but pass this one up. Oh man, what was up with Griffith?"
1,boring boring boring,"first of all its so boring...and 2ndly they are all ugly.....i only saw the first episode..and the rest i was just forwarding..the box is very attractive...but the show is so dull.,..maybe cus its not my type of anime....the drawings are old...anyway..it all goes after people's taste"
5,THE POWER OF POWER METAL,"Gamma Ray fans watch out for this one. Heavenly is up their with the likes of Gamma Ray, Helloween, Iron Saviour. In fact, Kia Hansen and Piet Seilk were both involved with helping Heavenly release this monster power metal CD. Every track on it is perfect. This is one CD that should be in everyone's stereo."
2,Same old same old,"Heavenly is power metal's version of bands like Cold Sweat, Valentine, Gypsy Rose, and a plethora of other pop metal bands that sprung up in the very late 80's and early 90's trying to cash in on the popularity gained by bands like Warrant, Poison, etc. Like these bands, Heavenly has nothing to add to the genre. Maybe if I liked the singer, I could give this 3 stars.... This is a... fine time to be a fan of heavy metal - a lot of talent out there. There used to be only one Bruce Dickinson. Now they are popping up all over the place.... Only die hard powermetallers will (blindly) appreciate this."
1,Something like this must defy the Geneva Convention.,"Heavenly is one of the 47 million European power metal bands that write terrible music. That means: pedestrian songwriting, simplistic arrangements, inane lyrics, overproduced drums, and guitar solos that...well, actually, the guitar solos are pretty melodic and decent.Picking a song highlight is impossible....... I think my favorite, though, is ""Carry Your Heart"", but not for any of the right reasons. The vocalist's delivery is so hilarious that it always makes me laugh. When he yells, ""SPIRIT OF MY LIFE!!"" and ""CLIMB A MOUNTAIN, TOUCH THE SKY!!"" he sounds so ridiculous I'm not sure whether I should cringe or stitch up my sides from the rip-roaring hilarity of it all. A third option comes into play...stop the CD and light it on fire. It's a popular choice, I'm sure.Anyway, this album is bad and you'd be better off spending your money on a Coke."
5,Very simple fun game.,"We got this for our son for Christmas, He has played it several times and has great fun with it. As a child I used to play an earlier version of this game on the computer, I'm glad to see my son enjoys on his PSP it as much as I did on the computer."
3,A Little Too Small,"I have never played this game before on any other platform, but I expected a lot considering what I've read about it and the fact that it has appeared on multiple platforms over the span of many years. Overall, I guess it's a fun puzzle game, but certain levels are like many other puzzle games in that if you can't figure out a specific puzzle, you're stuck, and there is nothing in a manual or otherwise to help you out. Worst of all, however, is the fact that unless you use the zoom feature on the PSP 3000, you will go blind trying to see the little characters, what they are doing, and where they are going/if they are doing what you want for them to."
2,The Photo Isn't Representative,"I usually like Springbok quality but was disappointed in this. While the picture you see here shows nice clear colors and good definition, the actual puzzle was much darker and murkier: almost blurry-looking. So not only was it visually displeasing, it wasn't fun to work. We gave up partway through."
3,"Slightly Blurry and just ""ok"" to do.","I'd have to agree with the other review. it wasn't fantastic but the other Springbok I got (the grape vine) was WAY blurry'er so this one didn't bother me.We finished it but you're right the quality wasn't _quite_ there for the price.Having said that. If you like trains, it was a good one to do!"
1,See my review of the non-rental version before renting!,"It's over inMountain Bike Repair.Basically the video is light on content and bicyle repair isn't a one-shot thing, so you'd be better served by the DVD or a book."
2,Odd illustrations,The Rhymes themselves are Okay but I was dissappointed in the illustrations. It is odd how humpty dumpty is not really illustrated the way we all know Humpty.
5,Very special children's books,"We have the board books (like this one), as well as the two large hardbound books. My children love them, especially my daughter age two, one of whose first words was ""Winkie!"" after the Wee Willie Winkie rhyme. I find the negative reviews of these books very puzzling -- don't the authors of those reviews have any imagination? Or are they just close-mindedly PC? Or maybe they just do not know (literally) that a dumpling is a boiled pastry that is eaten with butter and sugar? An aspect of nursery rhymes is their connection to deep, and ancient, currents of culture."
4,Board book fan,"I knew my first son would love books when he gnawed his way through his first two board books. Now my second son is well on his way, both paging through and chewing on the sturdy board pages of this charming and colorful edition of Humpty Dumpty. Captivating rhythms and bright attention-getting illustrations are sure to delight any fan (child or adult) of Well's animal characters. Previous reviewers expressed concern about rhymes like ""Davy Davy Dumpling"" but before censoring this book, I'd ask them to think back to when your child was a plump and cuddly infant. How many times did you tickle him and say ""I'm going to eat you up!"" Did you really mean it? When you change a diaper are you ""sugaring and buttering"" your baby with powders and creams? I eat my baby up several times a day and it makes him laugh hysterically!"
2,is humpty dumpty an egg or a rabbit?,"I loved to concept of a board rhyme book but thought the illustrations here were off base. The first rhyme left our son asking ""where did he go?"" Is the star of this humpty dumpty or what? Our collective favorite is the Classic Mother Goose, edited by A. Eisen. beautiful illustrations there- unfortunately not as hardy.."
3,Reasonably Well Written Biography of the Greatest Man Alive,I consider President Gordon B. Hinckley of the LDS Church to be the greatest man alive today. There is a real interest in his life and the things that might have made him great. This is an enjoyable book which provides a lot of interesting information about President Hinckley. It is reasonably well written and well organized. It doesn't contain any information about a lot of the great events and actions of the Prophet since he has become President of the Church. I hope that someone else (maybe one of the other Apostles) will someday write a really top notch book about President Hinckley.
4,A very good atmospheric metal album,This concept is like Paradise Lost with Tiamat together. The music is very good and the vocals are brutal. It has songs that i like and the song Haven that i love. The duration of the album is average but it worth's the time to check this album if you like <> atmospheric metal
4,"Great, but no classic","After hearing Projector, I was excited about this new album from DT. I like Projector but it is by far nothing close to At the Gates or In Flames. I then heard Gallery, and was wondering how a band can release a masterpiece like Gallery and then end up on Projector. But Haven kind of reminds me of Gallery in a loose sort of way. I really did enjoy this album. Its melodies are very pleasant. I think any fan of Swedish metal should have this album. My advice, get Gallery first and then this album."
4,still good but not as before,"every album of DT is great, that's a truth that no one can deny, even if they have been going through different ways the final sound is always great, i must be honest and say that i love more other older albums as skydancer or the gallery, but the exploration of new ways to create music will always return to their esence, the dark tranquillity... i hope also that DT always continue being one of the best metal bands of the world, please don't change so much. hey niklas, i miss your compositions."
5,Simply Awesome,"this album is simply awesome, if you liked their last album (like me) Projector and a fan of their earlier material then this will not dissappoint but will rather pleasure you. Combining striking melodies and heavy riffs with keys it creates one hell of an album, all METAL fans go get this album now or get it right here from Amazon.com. Enjoy!"
4,Kool out music,"It's been awhile since I've heard great ""POP"" music and this is great ""POP"" music. Reminds me of stuff from ""Style Council"". You'll hum alot of the songs after the second listen of this cd. A definite must have. Definitely awaiting to receive the latest release ""Postcards from Heaven""..Fonsos"
3,CD received.,Two ups: 1. Received CD in a timely manner. 2. It played perfectly. Three downs. 1. Shipped in slim line case 2. wrapped in paper. 3.

2,Uhh...where is the information????,"I was actually hoping to find a useful book that would help me implement PDM software, or at least provide guidelines and recommendations. After reading this book, I feel like I could have written it (even though I know next to nothing about the subject).It is so general, the subject is painted with very broad soft strokes. What about costs, implementation schedules, performance, real-world implementations, difficult release paths, conflicting requirements???Do *not* spend the money on this book. Seriously, you will be dissapointed. It is hardly worth a fraction of the cost (pick it up used, if you must)."
5,Beautiful !,Nice quality for a fair price. Jack's work takes you back to a more romantic time. Looks great in our dance studio.
2,Ummmm...well......,"Follows the Todd Browning plot line...but not the care and tastefullness he had used. The circus people aren't really in this very much, just briefly here and there. Contains alot of unneeded gore.Watch something else"
2,Weird,this movie was weird. the only thing i liked about it was the specail effects and the costumes but it was kinda stupid. so thats why i gave it 2 stars
2,"Well, it's certainly not the original.","Basically a rehash of the original (and classic) film FREAKSFreaksonly with quite a bit more gore, poor acting and less style. If you are in the mood for this kind of a film and don't like gratuitous gore check out the original and leave this one alone."
3,Nice collection...,"...of beat-oriented cult classics from the 80's. Gina X is the rare gem here, as it is so far unavailable on cd anywhere else. Torch Song's ""P2E remix"" would have been a great selling point for this cd, had it not been (sigh...) poorly mastered from vinyl - not much surface noise but boomy, distorted bass and overall muffled sound. Still, the fact alone that there are no plans for any Torch Song reissues on the horizon makes this a worthwhile purchase for the desperate collector."
3,Great information about grains,"This book contains interesting and informative information about just about every grain plus some legumes, nuts, and seeds. The only problem I have with this book is that it seems that the recipes were not tested. The first two recipes I tried did not work they way there were written which makes me hesitant to try any others. Another thing that makes me feel that perhaps these weren't tested is that there are no recipes yields so you don't know how many of a cookie your making or how many servings a recipe will make."
3,Not recommended,"I was looking for a user friendly whole grain cookbook. I was disappointed in this one. A lot of the recipes are on the ""weird"" side or use hard to get ingredients. For instance there is a recipe for Amaranth Pancakes which calls for acorn flour. Where do you find acorn flour--not a staple in my cupboard.I think there are better choices when looking for a whole grain cookbook."
5,An outstanding addition to any cookbook collection.,"Barley, oats and corn are the feature of this cookbook, which packs in recipes for using whole grains in a fresh way. Desserts and breads feature heavily in these dishes, which also include plenty of main course options."
3,"Lightweight, but it has its charms","Esther Williams stars in this silly South Pacific love story, filmed largely on the Hawaiian island of Kauai (although the story is supposed to be set in Tahiti...) Her love interest is the schmaltzy show tune crooner Howard Keel, playing a lazy American who inherits an abandoned coconut farm, and after making it out to the island picks up a yen for the half-Tahitian hottie played by Williams. She tames him, he mellows out, learns to like small children and to kick back into Tahitian time, just like the locals. Musically, the Harry Warren compositions are not, admittedly, among his best work, although there is a dazzling Tahitian dance number, staged in a Busby Berkeley-like fashion, and if you know Kauai at all, the improbable cutaways from one beach to the next are pretty hilarious. Not the greatest musicial ever (and Williams hardly gets in the water at all!) but it has it's charms. Take the ""happy native"" stuff with a grain of salt, though."
2,It is a friendly movie with friendly songs.,"In this movie, Esther is a native Hawaiian rich girl. Howard Keel comes to the islands for the simple life and finds that life with Esther around is anything but simple. The water dancing sequences are not the most original or spectacular. It is a friendly movie with friendly songs."
2,Lightweight musical,"There is nothing taxing or demanding about Pagan Love song and people wanting escapist fare may be pleased with it. Lush island scenery and a hummable score are the film's strongest assets. It is a long way, however, from producer Arthur Freed's finest achievements. 2 1/2 stars."
2,Smell nice but leave you and the tub covered in soap,"I purchased these for my honeymoon to romance the wife.They do smell like roses and they look really nice until you put them into the water. They melt pretty fast, lose their shape and leave the water a red/pink color. Some of them stuck to the side of the tub and became solid again when they cooled. I had to wash it off with warm water. And when you get out of the tub, you feel the film from the soap covering your body and hair and its not pleasant.If your lady is laid back she may say ""its the thought that counts"". If she's not that kind of lady, I wouldn't recommend these. Instead go with a nice bubble bath, you won't feel like you need to shower when you're done."
5,Holding on!,"This cd contains two of the three best songs LTD has ever done: Holding on and We both deserve each others love. The third song I'm talking about...Love Ballad, you knew that didn't you?"
2,"My kid wouldn't use it, I wasted my money.","I tried to help my son get the needed resources to help him increase his test scores, but he wouldn't read it, so it was actually a waste of my money....he can't blame me, I tried!"
4,stephen woodworth,"good writer with a great subject. but as the series continue, the subject fades a bit. with red hands, being the 2nd book, it was still a great book"
4,Read in One Day,"This author has created characters we care about which I think will be the key to this series. While I don't think the plot was as good as the 1st book in the series, this book still kept me reading all day long. Now I'm sorry because the next one isn't due until Spring 2006! Oh well -- it was a fun ride."
3,Went a little over the edge for me,"Loved ""Through Violet Eyes"" but the sequel was a whole lot rougher. This was one I couldn't read at night and the 'Thresher' appearances were almost more than I can handle. Loved the earlier mystery element, but this one goes a little too far towards horror and was a hard read--at least, for this reader.If you like strong horror, this is definitely a novel to read, though. I like the series and the concept very much."
4,With Red Hands,"Natalie Lindstrom is trying to build a life for herself and her 5 year old daughter, Callie. Both ""Violets"", they are able channel the souls of the dead. Natalie, however, finds herself in the middle of a controversial court case with deadly consequences.-Can she help find the real killer?-Can she protect Callie from the North American Afterlife Communication Corps, who want to take her away to ""The School""?-And what is ""the Thresher"", that haunts Natalie's mother's mind?Fast paced with characters you come to care about and plot twists that keep you guessing, With Red Hands was a wonderful book I couldn't put down. I eagerly await the next book Stephen Woodworth writes!"
4,Creatively done!,"Great book...creepy and imaginative. Gave me nightmares, but in a good way. Natalie is such a strong character that you just can't help, but follow her to the end."
5,Praise for Stephen Woodworth!,"Through Violet Eyes hooked me, With Red Hands pulled me back in, and In Golden Blood made me want only more. What makes these stories great is that such a fantastic idea of the Violets is possible! I never stopped myself in these stories to say ""HOW can they do this?"" in the context that it was impossible. Woodworth manages to duplicate his previous work with such real characters that even the bad guys have back stories and motives, much like real life. I highly recommend these stories to anybody who likes a good fiction story, and I cannot wait until From Black Rooms comes out."
5,great continuation to an awesome story!!!,"I picked up ""through violet eyes"", the first book to this series, and was immediately hooked, the plot and characters were so real and gripping...when i learned that ""with red hands"" was to follow, i went out immediately and purchased it...woodworth follows through with the storyline and has the same characters that you relate to through the first book, plus some new and interesting characters...this book keeps you holding your breath til the end, it's hard to put down because it's fast paced and really holds your attention...i cannot wait for the next book which is due soon...woodworth has some real genuine talent and i highly recommend this book to all who love suspense!"
1,Over-the-top and Boring...,"I found the free information about this child-killer over the internet as informative as this incredibly boring, sprawling, repetitive, unprofessionally produced, shoe-string budgeted video. The only two people interviewed in this taped attempt at documentary are a woman who drones on in psycho-bable that carries nothing but the obvious observations we can make ourselves, and the carnival ramblings of a freak show/oddities collector. This guy is about as scary as the subject matter. Viewing this video left me with a bad taste in my mouth, and I'm no cannibal. Save your money."
1,I'd rather meet Al in a dark basement....,I'd rather meet Al in a dark basement than have to sit through this turkey again. Low budge doesn't have to mean low quality but sadly in this case....
1,Poorly written,"A boring read...the author has not spent a lot of time on creating a cohesive story. Names appear out of nowhere, the storyline shifts abruptly to totally different placea and totally different persons, etc. Why do I need to know about Treynor? Jensen? I bought this book to learn about Fischer Black.There is almost a whole chapter on the Black's family history from the mid 1800's on...at some point I was thinking ""why am i reading this? why am i spending my time with this book?"" it was like reading the old testament...I have a huge collection of finance books, being a professional trader. This is one of the less successful buys. This is very disappointing, because it deals with a very interesting person."
1,Lacking,"The book has little on how exactly finance works or why it is interesting. Where are the math, the politics, and the results that justify the ""revolutionary ideas""?"
5,THIS IS GREAT,once again it's me saying don't listen to the guys that say this is bad because it isn't this is great just like all the other filler episodes.THIS RULES!!!!!!! AND SCREW ANYONE WHO'S OPINION IS DIFFERENT YOU ARE IRRELEVAT.
1,Dave says it all.,Thank God the misery is over. This whole story line s*cked. Dont waste your money.
1,Crap,I got this because it was cheap and you get what you pay for! Very lo and bad sound quality and if the jack moved at all on the iPod it would make a static sound
4,good deal for the price!,"Just received these headphones. The sound is clear and bright with good bass response without sounding boomy, even at high volume. Nice and rich sound. I have a large head and they are moderately comfortable - slightly tight but I expect they will loosen up over time (all my other headphones with similar construction usually do). The audio cable is nice and thick and the plug feels solid when connected to my stereo or an audio extension cable. Good fit around the ears - does not crimp my ears (some models can have cans that are too small and cover part of the ear). Overall - 4 stars!Plan to buy a few more for the family home theatre."
3,My head's too big!,"Another guy commented about how these phones were uncomfortable on his large head. I should've listened! Can't stand them, although they do sound good. Recommended only for people with normal-sized heads!"
3,not the best studio headphones,the sound is great but ive bought 2 because of the first one got a shortage in one of the wires then it happend to the other one i bought. Def spend more if u want quality headphones that will last
4,Good headphones for the price,Not bad in terms of audio quality. My biggest drawback is the stiffness of the cord which makes it really hard to wrap.
3,Just okay...,This trivet is okay for seven bucks...the design is really pretty.I just want to mention that it is see through...it's hard to tell that by the picture. Mine arrived with black specks on it...I'm not sure what those are.
5,Perfect at what it was meant for,"There wasn't a review up, so I thought I'd say something. This book is meant to teach about the origins of poi, it is NOT a book on poi moves. It is the PERFECT (and only) book for learning about the history and cultural signif of poi. It covers nearly everything that you'd like to know (how traditional poi are made), and wouldn't like to know (poi representing genitals). A good place to look for learning more about poi is [website] - there is another review of the book up there."
4,A really cool toy! But there is one thing...,"The x-ray thing is sorta hard to work. The thing that pops up won't stay down. Apart from that little detail, it is an amazing toy. Great work Hasbro! (or Mattel, I'm not sure!)It works great with Bratz being the vets, too. But you could use barbie or something too. I just like Bratz best. Anyway, buy this and you will not be disipointed."
1,TERRIBLE!,"I ordered the Get Better Center with confidence that I would love it...I DON'T! I barely ever play with it. The bandaids did NOT stick to the pets, the X-Ray machine did not work... and there is barely enough room for all the pets to fit it there if you get bonus pets. I had to stuff them in the birds little closet to close it up. This product is a complete dissapointment. I now feel guilty for wasting my parents money on this item. I am 11 yr.s old and I barely understand it! Do not get this!"
1,Big Disappointment,"I am a HUGE Lynn Anderson fan. The first record I ever bought was Lynn Anderson. This DVD is HORRIBLE!!!!! Don't waste your money like I did. Her microphone was off throughout the entire concert and you could only barely hear her through the whole concert. There is an interview before the concert, no problem. An interview after the concert, no problem. The entire concert all you hear is music and a muffled Lynn from somewhere in the background. What a waste. I can't believe they actually put something out this bad."
5,A great real-life hiking guide,"Bonnie Henderson's hiking books are consistently good. This one highlights some lesser-known hikes along the Oregon Coast. My parents live on the coast, and many of these hikes were pleasant surprises to them. Difficulty is accurately noted. The author, an Oregon resident, really hikes all the trails in her books. This book would be a great gift for anyone living or travelling the Oregon Coast."
1,generic Le Bra front end cover,"Two reorders did not fit my toyota camry. It needed a cover made for that year (2005) by Covercraft which fitted nicely,"
5,Excellent,This bag is excellent and has straps to hold a marker (A-5 for me) securly with air tank and 2 spare barrels. (And a stock in my case)Definately recommend.
1,BAD DESIGN.,"This is a terrible design because the actual rack area with the hooks floats out away from the wall, thus the pressure from the weight of objects on the hooks will eventually wrench the anchors out of the wall, even if you are careful about not hanging too much on the rack. My husband is an engineer and has used the most weight-bearing wall anchors and it just eventually always falls out of the wall, most recently pulling out some sheetrock."
5,The best book on the topic I have read to date.,"Mr. Florence's pattern information and full-color photos have been extremely helpful. I began collecting a bit more than a year ago, but because of this book, I have been able to surprise even a few dealers with my knoledge of glassware. It has been an invaluable recource."
1,Save Your Money,"At best, this is a crude outline for what could become a very good book. The characters begin as underdeveloped and go down from there. I could not finish this book it was so bad. The timeline is disjointed, which makes the shallow chacters even harder to take seriously. This is doing nothing more than taking up room on the Kindle."
3,Alpha Finally Gets One Right,"Considering the quality (or lack of) on most of their product, I was pleasantly surprised to discover that the Alpha DVD of DR. BLOOD'S COFFIN is a very nice transfer with good color and sound. If only some of their other stuff looked this good! This is well worth the money if you want to add this title to your horror movie collection."
2,More like a toy not quality,I bought this tambourine because I needed a replacement for my old REMO I left at a gig and it got good reviews. REMO is my favorite brand for tambourines and with the radiant design I figured 'good sound...a little disco...it's a win win.' Not so much. The plastic-like head makes a poor percussion sound that is both tin-like and not professional or quality sounding. The cymbols are almost so over powering its tough to get a smooth groove. I would consider this instrument more for fun than for quality entertainment. This one is going to my young daughter for campfire singing. I would not recommend it for anything more.
2,What Happened?,"I bought the first few Ashes books back in the 80s in paperback and remembered them fondly. Recently I downloaded some of the later books for my Kindle and find myself going ""what the hell"". D-Day In the Ashes seems like a parody of his earlier works and makes me wonder if somebody else is actually writing the series now. The political characterizations are comical at best and are enjoyed by people that actually think that people like Glenn Beck are serious commentators. The series has definately gone downhill."
2,Purchaser - OH Happy Day - Buddah Classics,The recordings are very good. The song selection for the price is dissapointing. I cannot recommend this cd versus other selections that offer more songs.
4,DVD review,Overall the package is a good value for the money. Downside many of these episodes were inculded in other offerings
5,You can't put it down!,True Stories about this writers Horrific Childhood inside and how she overcame it all! You can not put this book down!
5,Weekend Cooking (Kitchen Coach),This book is a must have for everyone that loves great tasting food that doesn't take forever to get on the table! I love Jennifer's recipes and my family does too. What an asset to the culinary arts!
2,Could have been much better,"This book is one of the few that tries to document the names, dates, and shows of old-time radio. When I first picked the book up I was thrilled to see that their were many bios about radio celebrities and many write-ups about the great radio shows. However, as I read on, I found many glaring inaccuracies. As I continued, I took a pencil and paper and started to write them down. Halfway through the book I had found 2 full pages of mistakes. These mistakes include saying that announcer Russ Hodges was sportscasting well into the 1980s (Hodges in fact died in 1970) and printing the wrong year of birth and death for many other celebrities. Any book on the golden age of radio is difficult to find information for. But at times it seems that the author didn't even bother to research this book. It was very disappointing."
1,Riddled with inaccuracies as from a .357 Magnum,"This book is full of inaccuracies from beginning to end. I list a few of them in Cave Canem, an online guide to reference book erratas. Email me for the URL."
3,Disallusioned,"When I found this book I thought it was great. I liked the fact that the author included appendices with radio people who weren't a main part of the book and how he went to the trouble of finding the radio clubs and organizations and listing all those sound effects folks. But I noticed, as I was looking through the book, quite a few innacuracies. The Book even contradicts itself in a few places. I appreciate a book on old time radio, but this one needs to be re-researched and fixed up quite a bit."
1,"Worst excuse for a ""reference"" book I've ever come across","Five years later, and nothing's changed - this book is still an embarrassment and Facts on File will never own up to it.I need not cite any other example than this one: The entry on the pioneering program ""Amos 'n' Andy"" runs for several pages - and through the entire piece, Lackmann confuses Charles Correll, who played Andy, with Freeman Gosden, who played Amos, persistently having it the other way round. If he cannot even get this elemental fact about the show straight, there is no reason to pay attention to any other assertion he might make. It's inexcusable.As others note, errors like this may be found on every single page. What a waste of paper.Readers interested in old-time radio are directed to the very excellent ""On the Air: the Encyclopedia of Old-Time Radio,"" by John Dunning."
4,Well-woven tale,"This book was a departure from my typical summer reading materials. However, I was quickly ""hooked"" and anxious to delve into this complex and historically accurate novel. I have never read anything quite like this book. Our book club read the book and could've discussed it for hours. Well done Mr. Royer!"
4,"Good, but a little disappointing","This certaintly is a rare opportunity to see Sabicas play.The reason I did not give it 5 stars is that the selctions Sabicas plays do not have the musical depth as on his 1959 release of ""Flamenco Puro"". Also there are two baile (dance) pieces (a Zorongo and a Siguiriya) by ""Los Duendes de Espana"" that do not include Sabicas. This is a relativley short video (37 minutes). For that reason I would have prefered to see Sabicas play the entire time.The film concludes with a 1966 somewhat grainy black and white footage of Sabicas playing Danza Arabe. I do think this video is worth the money. However if you are a Sabicas fan you may be a little disappointed."
3,"Good content, poorly recorded","The instructor has difficulty speaking English, so he only does introductions to the forms and has 2 of his star students take it from there. The recording is done right in his martial arts studio. You can hear the traffic from outside which is overpowering at times. You will want to be accustomed to the martial arts before starting this course via your TV as some of the forms require practice and learning that can only come from an instructor standing in front of you. Those aspects aside, the knowledge content is smack on. Buy it if you are ready for it."
1,What a Waste of Time & Money--Major Disappointment,"I purchased the 4-CD Box Set of this collection, but regarding disc 3, I was disappointed beyond words. Yet, I'll try to express myself in this review. It's really very simple. I'm quite sure most people buying this CD are interested in listening to these classic, old school rap songs. Instead, you get Grandmaster Flash basically mixing & scratching every single song at the beginning, and cutting the length of each song from the beginning to the end!! I can't believe that the label who put this out (THUMP) felt the target audience would be interested in hearing a mix sesssion that sounds like it was done by ME in my bedroom when I was 12 years old. People want to hear these songs in an uncut, original capacity, not sounding like they've been transfered from a Saturday night rap-oriented radio mixshow. This is absolutely terrible!!!"
4,oh YEAH!!!,"That's what love songs often do, was and still is to me, one of the most straight-forward alternative albums ever made. This follow up, is little more edgy and a lot more guitar driven. More unique. I love the first album. But this album is really good. I found out about fig dish from former tour mates of theirs, local H. <Another great band. But, Fig dish, this is great. There's 99 tracks on here. And the 99th is an interesting hiddent gem. g-r-r-r-r-r-r-REATTTTT!!!"
5,Good for alergies,"This product is great, works as advertised. I have two dogs and always had particles floating in the air. Within 24 hours of turning this product on the air is completly clear."
4,Well done Jazz,"Good soothing Jazz by Akira Jimbo. Not his best album (in my opinion), but really good."
4,Nice jazzdance album,"Llorca is a DJ from France that released his debut album on the same label as St. Germain and Laurent Garnier. A sticker on the cd shouts ' From the people who discovered St. Germain'. That's what I'd call dumb, misplaced marketing. It's like a voice over announcing a movie with 'academy award winner blahblah...' So far the fun is spoiled, because if you compare this album with St. Germain, you'll be dissapointed. You should listen to Llorca simply as a fine jazzdance album. Nothing more, nothing less. The style of music is more like De-Phazz than St. Germain, with 'Indigo blues' , the second track, with the indisputable highest hit-potential. If you already own the albums from De-Phazz and St. Germain, go for Llorca, too."
4,Good if you like vocals with your grooves,"It's rare to hear great grooves blended well with vocals, which is a wonderful combination in my opinion. If you're into just listening to intense mixed beats then this is not your album. It is jazzy, and catchy, and isn't tiring to listen to like many ""electronica"" groups."
4,Top notch CD,"I initially came across Llorca through the Hed Kandi label ""Chill"" compilation series but this is not just chilling music it is music to really warm you up. I was unsure about buying this CD initially based on just the one track that I had heard ""The End"" but having listened to it I can honestly recommend this to the most discerning listener. Jazzy and groovy. The Jazzy label might put some people off but don't let it as that is just part of the theme to the music. It is sensual and entices the listener to really get down.Go out and buy and I promise you won't be dissapointed."
3,i liked it ANY HOW...,"i really liked 2 tracks on this album, but thought the rest was a bit same ol', same ol'.the standout track for me was ANY HOW. nice little 6 minute chilled housey track that reminds me of a nice relaxing sunday afternoon. i also used to like THE END, but have heard about 20 million remixes of it on the FCOMM label, and think that it should finally be put to rest.peace MR0"
4,Excellent sourcebook for readers,"This book, originally loaned to me by a police professional, is an excellent resource for a variety of readers who are involved with criminal investigations but don't really have all the tools and training of a full-time medical examiner. In my case, as a crime author, the text was an invaluable reference, putting some highly technical material into easily digested context. The collection of photographs, while occasionally grisly, provides an excellent visual reference. Recommended for laymen of all kinds who need a good reference work on forensic pathology."
3,MISSING INFORMATION,"MISSING INFORMATION IN THE BOOK ABOUT SHOTGUN WOUNDS, AUTOPSY PROCEDURE,BLOOD SPOTS ETC."
5,Wonderful Textbook Style Book,"This book didn't beat around the bush at all. It took you right into the morbid details of death. Every subject I can think of regarding death was explained in this book. The pictures were mostly black and white but the detail in them was still enough to stir my stomach.This book went from babies to burns, from rapes to stabbings, from gunshots to suffocation. It told you how things were done and why evidence was placed the way that it was.This book was in textbook form and I believe that it is actually used for students to learn with. In saying that, you can not only learn with this book but you can also keep yourself interested with having some death questions answered.Overall, a wonderful book for someone looking to get into the forensic field, or for someone just interested in death and how some things happen."
2,Not what I was hoping for,"I was a little disappointed with this rack. In the picture, it looks fairly upright, but in practice, it opens pretty wide and takes up more space than I thought it would. It's attractive, just not what I was hoping for in my small bathroom space."
1,Don't buy,It is bigger than the picture and opens up bigger than it should for a magazine. It is more along the lines of a wood log holder. I was very disappointed when I received it. Great for holding wood but not for magazines. I would not recommend.
2,POSSIBLY STANWYCK'S WORST FILM,"iN THE 1950s, when good roles for women of Stanwyck's age were hard to come by, she had to relegate herself to doing ""B"" pictures that were mediocre to just plain awful. This movie is quite possibly the worst she ever made. The labyrinthine plot is a 'snoozer' with Stanwyck running a teak plantation in the Burmese jungles. When the animals are more entertaining than the stars, we have to worry. I am Barbara Stanwyck's biggest fan.....she always pulled low class stuff up to her level and she does it with this as well. Unfortunately, the production values do not measure up and I'm sure she would be the first to tell you not to waste your time with this rotten piece of work. Stanwyck is first-rate and it is worth a look just to observe her work with bad material and see what a great actress she was. But don't spend money for this unless you are a bona fide Stanwyck fan who wants a copy of ALL her work in good or bad pictures. This is a great example of a BAD PICTURE."
1,Broke in about 3 seconds,"I used this for my air compressor (Viair 70P), and in about 3 seconds, it broke. I couldn't even use it to charge my cell phone or iPod. It probably works great for small things but not big things like air compressors."
5,Love at first sight.,"Neon Genesis Evangelion. Just the title itself wants to make you find out what the hell it could possibly mean. I'm not gonna sit here boring you with a summary of the story. Just give you the plain facts that this is one of the greatest Anime ever created. Personally it's my favorite. While it includes top notch artwork, I alone would watch it just for the characters. Character development play a big role in movies, and this one keeps you waiting for more! I'm telling you, I'm hyping this series soooo much you're just gonna have to check it out...I have everything imaginable that has been marketed for this series...That's how much I love it...Simply put; A series with beautiful characters you'll hate so much you'll fall in love with, phenomenal artwork, and a gorgeous score to top it off! Why wait for rentals? Own a piece of art today."
2,Over rated,"There are those that prasie this series very highly. Well it's time for something different. Haveing watched the series, I can only say I found the characters very unlikeable with very few exceptions. As well as a old and used story premisis of the hero and his giant robo verses the monster of the day with a twist. The monsters are called ""Angels"" which is strange when they look nothing like the usuall depiction of an Angel, more demonic look to them really. And the storys atempt to mix Christian sysmbolism with Babylonian mythology doesn't exactly work well here either.If still want to watch it, watch it for what it is, the darker side of being the hero. It's not that great of a series but it's an ok one."
3,If you like that 'ripped - off feeling',"You will like this series if --You identifier with boring whinny self-absorbed neurotics-You like rambling plots that go no where-You like one-dimensional stock characters-You like low quality animation - (cutout type static images the move across the screen) - that makes Pokemon look good.-You like endings that leave you with the 'HUH' feelingAfter spending the money I really tried to convince my self I was enjoying the series, but I just couldn't do it. Better to get Bubblegum Crisis, even with some faults is a much better series than this."
3,Good anime,"The serires starts out hard and fast, lots of action, good characters, great art. Sadly, the serires ends with a confusing, and very actionless, limp psychadelic trip. Taken as a whole, the series is dissapointing, due mostly to the ending."
5,Evangelion: An excellent but misunderstood series.,"This is more a review OF the reviews for this series. It is an excellent series, with lifelike and personally deep characters, which you will either love or hate. The thing is, the story just plays out, and does not attempt to explain itself to the watcher. You're SUPPOSED to watch the ending and go ""What?"". You have to watch it and then THINK about it. Yes. THINK. Something anime series rarely call for you to do. Admittably, the last two episdoes suck because the TV nets told the makers to end it. now. End of Eva was planned all along and is simply released separately because there's no other way to do it. It is most useful if you see the last two eps and EoE as an internal and external telling out of the same events."
5,Incredible Anime,Groundbreaking. Visually stunning. Evangelion is a perfect blend of Animation and Drama with an old school giant robo feel. If your are a big fan of anime and want to see something different besides giant robots and demon monsters from the psychic plane. Evangelion is for you. The most notable feature is the human like reactions every character has. Each character has a separate and unique personality complete with strengths and weaknesses. Be warned this anime is not for young children there is strong language and suggested nudity.
1,Stupid.,This series is boring... the relationships are immature and there's very little action compared to how much senseless rambling there is. Save your money! If you are still curious then go rent an episode so you can see for yourself what a waste of time this series is!
5,The Greatest,"If u haven't watch anime in ur life then u should start with this because its one of the best anime ever made u can watch it so many times and u will still learn new things in the series that u didn't know was there, this should definitely be in ur video library and if u are an anime collector u should have this with out a doubtP.S. Movies are coming out soon, go get it"
1,Its like a Rollar Coaster...That kills you,"im reluctant to even give it a single star. Neon Genesis Evangelion, or EVA as me and my otaku friends call it was terrible. In the begining, we get your overused mecha piolet. Neglected, and reluctant, Shinji Ikari pilots eva 01. His whinning and doubt are easily ignored for most the series which is a lot of buildup. At first i thought this series was phenominal, until i reached the ending. The story just kept getting better, like the first hill of a rollar coaster, getting you ready for the main event, in this case, the ending. But then the ending came. In the las few episodes, eva went from great to the worst anime i've ever seen. Shinji turns gay with the last angel and chaos ensues. This series belongs in the trash. Once you reach the top of the hill of the rollar coaster, you plummet to your death."
4,Not That Perfect Collection,"Watched the first dvd when a co-worker said ""you gotta watch this"" and have been hooked since then. It has just the right mixture between character dev and action. There is an underlying ""conspiracy"" theme where not everything is known and each dvd gives you just enough info to feel satisfied as well has wanting to know more. That is until you come to the ending episodes, the it is like whatthehell?? I some how felt as though they were trying to instill hope into kids in Japan. Sometimes found the the bilical references disturbing, but at the same time found it to be an interesting element to put into an anime.Given the popularity of the series as well as some of the more feature packed dvds out there, I was a bit disappointed additional ""behind the scenes"" were left out. Nonetheless a great series and price you can not beat."
5,A Masterpiece of Animation,"You've heard it before and you'll hear it again: Neon Genesis Evangelion is a masterpiece; one of the greatest anime series ever created. Just about every aspect of a good plot is represented in this series, and, if you're like me, you'll feel bad that you go through the entire series in a few days. It's so hard to stop watching the series. This is one of the only animes that ive backtracked and rewatched several times in order to fully appreciate each episode. It is incredibly deep, the action is intense and often times gruesome and scary, (it's not just big robots beating each other up, the fighting is really primal and savage) character interactions are meaningful, and this series will make you look at yourself in a whole new way. All in all, this series is second to none. I implore you, get this series!!!! (dont forget the manga series ^_^)"
4,Must be missing something,"Ok, I'm a reasonable guy. NGE is a good series, and I enjoyed watching it. But best series ever made anywhere? Hardly. The charectors in the end are barely changed from what they were at the start of the series; emotionally scared. The action is few and far between, with the battles with the angels barely taking up any plot time, and most of those battles are merely vehicles for the continued emotional problems from the main charectors social lives. The charectors are at least memorable, and the plot is certainly deep, if not too much so.The only way I could see NGE getting 5 stars is if someone could really connect with the charectors, such as if they were going through an emotional upheval or if they felt depressed. Otherwise, the laughs are rare, the action is sparse, and the plot is more confusing than a computer manuel. But still see it; people seem to feel moved no matter what the reality is."
2,box set neon genesis evangilion,"Interesting series of kids being mentally tied to thier robot. But the robot is thier own being too. So when the pilot blacks out the robot takes over at times.The only thing I disliked about the series is the trauma. Father doesn't love me. He would rather work than do anything with me, love me, say anything encouraging to me. It's so full of woe is me stuff.As long as there were enemies to fight. The woe is me stuff wasn't too bad when mixed with hope and understanding. But once all was done and the last 2 dvd's were full of disappointing woe is me stuff. That's what made this box set very disappointing.I was hoping for more of an up beat ending. A new hope. All the angles (enemy creatures) are dead and the boy would take his favorate girl or girls and escape from his father. The father that didn't show that he cared."
3,Shame on you hideaki Anno,"I couldn't agree more with Manasseh Quisenberry from Bremerton.The series starts good but falls flat at the end. The last two episodes are forced into the series. Many questions were left out to be answered in the 2 movies like a way of sucking more money from the fans just to leave us with the same ending that we hated in the first place. Hideaki Anno is infamous just because of his great ability to anger his fans by hitting them under the belt TWICE.Borrow it from a friend or rent it at most but please don't buy it.Don't spend your money on something that leaves you with a hollow feeling at the end. If I had the option of rent I wouldn't have bought it either. After all, if you are an anime fan, you have to watch Neon Genesis evangelion because it has so many original ideas. Too bad it was ruined at the end by the troubled mind of its director."
2,Hate saying this but...,"I found the story line repetetive, boring, and predictable. I hate not liking anime but this wasn't very good. The ending sucked. I know it was redone but geese. The sound track was irritating, the graphics could have been better and the characters were on the ""un"" side of interesting."
2,"Great initial episodes, final episodes SUCK!!!!","Started off great, finished up with lots of still-shot anime (did the budget run low?). The final episodes were horrible!"
4,Fantastic series that isn't for the simple minded.,"Finally a series that I actually think lives up to some if it's hype. I will admit on my first time it came off as mere techno bubble. But there actually is more to it and the characters have a great amount of depth. I laugh hysterically when I hear the characters in Elfen Lied and Hell Girl have depth. The people who love those series have to be on drugs.The action is pretty good, but it's the realistic characters with genuine feelings that stand out. Don't come into this looking for simple characters or storytelling. NGE will disappoint you if that's what you want."
5,A Classic for the Books,This was one of the best series I have ever seen with a good storyline and memorable characters. It's hard not to watch it over and over. A great price and buy from amazon makes a good gift or addition to anyones anamated or dvd collection.
4,Their best from the Carnival years.,"A very fine compilation of The Manhattans' early recordings for the much-revered Carnival label. While not one of the tracks included on this CD was a major hit they are all excellent examples of sweet and soulful Soul balladry.These recordings both foreshadow and point toward the direction The Manhattans' music would take once they signed with Columbia Records. Essential 1960s-early'70s Sweet Soul. The sound quality is not that good on most songs, however (which explains my being unable to give it a 5-star rating)."
1,DO NOT BUY,"Have had 42"" Magnavox Plasma for little over a 1.5 years, however this was for a second home and was rarely watched it prolly had less then 3000 hours on the display before a black vertical bar appered. Don,t waste your money on this junk."
4,Good Reference for Wing Chun/Kenpo/Etc. Practitioners,"This book is very well translated and lays out the various techniques clearly (with a couple of exceptions). Students of Kung Fu, Kenpo, Ninjitsu, and similar styles will find much familiar material here, with some twists. Provides a good range of weapons defenses, from blades to handguns, and is quite comprehensive for its size."
1,wouldn't recommend,"I bought this DVD hoping to learn more about house dance. I was disappointed in the quality of recording, the lack of confidence in the teacher's voice, and the painfully slow instructions. I had hoped to get 10 times what I did for the $25 expense. Not the best purchase in my opinion."
5,Telling the Untellable Truth,"J. R. Nyquist tells a truth that even knowledgable Americans do not want to hear: We are not necessarily the world's only superpower and while we have been busy bragging, the Russians and the Chinese have been busy developing producing and deploying new nuclear, chemical and biological weapons. We are endangered not by missile attacks from rogue nations, but from China and Russia who are capable of threatening us with modern weapons we have intentionally neglected to build. Mr, Nyquist lays out his case in a series of notes, each one standing alone, but which cause us to think. He has made a real, but unpleasant, case. We should take his warning seriously."
4,Bandini Bob,"This book is no page-turner. It is a tough read! The author is extrememely pessimistic about the future of the U. S. and indeed, the world. What Nyquist saw in the late 1990s has not completely come to pass..........yet! However, his read on the economic turmoil and resultant chaos is well-reasoned and presented. His thoughts on the resurgence of communism in whatever form and however called are less compelling. I have had e-mail contact with Jeff. He acknowledges his pessimism, but holds that his premises are substantially correct and his predictions for the future have every chance of being on the money."
4,Interesting,"As a new ""worm farmer"" I found this to be a great read. Although I thought I knew alot about worms, this book made me realize that I was a novice.I really enjoyed it."
4,Small things over long time = huge impact,"This book is an enjoyable read for any who like fact over fiction. At just the right length, it kept my interest throughout. I found that the frequent references about Charles Darwin added to the historical aspects as well as the scientific. If you are a gardener, farmer, scientist, historian, naturalist, or philosopher, then you will certainly enjoy the book."
5,What you do not know....,"This is a very interesting book. Most of us know something about what is beneath the oceans, but most of us know nothing about what is is beneath the earth. This book discusses the importance of earthworms, including where they should be and where they should not be. It is a book that every human being should read, now that we are, at long last, beginning to appreciate what we have left of the magnificent air, water, and earth that we inherited."
3,Better pregnancy yoga books,"I picked a copy of this book up and have to mostly say it's quite dated. Luckily I got it from the library. The photos thankfully have real pregnant women, but they are wearing 70's style leotards and other equally aged images. Also there are a lot drawings of women giving birth with big smiles on their faces, and though birth is joyful experience, I highly doubt even with positivity you'll be grinning.Some of the positives though are the importance of breath, the explanation of yoga and other pregnancy information in the first half of the book. It has a very reputable feel and some good information, but I think there are better guides with more updated information, I'm fond of Yoga for pregnancy, birth and beyond."
5,A must read,"If you are stressed, frustrated, rushed along, read this book. It is straightforward and clear about how to get off that fast track, how to make your life meaningful and fulfilling. This book is a manual for those who need to slow down and smell the flowers. Her prescriptions are community, simplicity, creativity - no airy-fairy idealism here - just experience and wisdom from living and learning. You will no longer let yourself be swept along with the madness but recreate yourself and your life in order to find deep and lasting satisfaction."
2,"Slow is Beautiful: New Visions of Community, Leisure and Joie de Vivre","I picked up this book because it sounded like something that EVERYONE should read. We definitely need to slow down, become involved in our communities and bring more happiness back into our lives. What I was subjected to in this book, however, was the author's political rants about how Conservatives have ruined this country! I'm an independent and I actually felt sorry for any conservative who might be reading this book - it was harsh. We are ALL a part of the problem, which makes us ALL a part of the solution. She does have some great quotes and some ideas that sound good no matter what your political party may be - hence the two stars. The joy is hidden in the vitriol in this book."
1,Disappointing!,"I was very disappointed in this book. Though it includes some useful summaries of related literature and research, the author's self-aggrandizing and bizarre, long-winded defense of quitting her job (I would have told her she would be fired under the circumstances as well) diminishes her credibility. As well, though I may agree with her, her editorializing on the Right Wing is boring and lacks analysis. I'm actually amazed that she found a publisher and that an editor actually scrutinized this book. Great topic- poorly addressed."
1,Simplicity and community? More like an intolerant rant.,"Cecile Andrews has some good ideas and good things to say, but these are very difficult to ferret out, as she appears to be consumed by a hatred of all things right-wing, most particularly George W. Bush. It's a little hard to build a case for building community when one is so intolerant of roughly half of the US population."
3,"Good information, but I don't like the author's tone","This book present good information on a important issue. Unfortunately, the author's tone makes the book hard to read. For example, she makes disparaging remarks about ""right-wingers."" I enjoyed reading the first five chapters and highlighted a few lines here and there and wrote comments in the margins. I found less pleasure and enlightenment as I read the rest of the book. The bibliography lists several books that I would like to read."
3,Great idea but tainted by political barbs and jabs,"I really wanted to love this book. And I agree with the reviewers who praise it for its basic premise -- and most of the content. But likewise, I was turned off by the abrupt political jabs and barbs that laced an otherwise lovely treatise on slow living. In the book, the author often points out that Americans are ""competitive"" and caught up in one-up-manship. Yet her periodic rants against Republicans and ""the right wing"" seem combative and challenging in ways that contradict the overall spirit of the lifestyle she is trying to promote. I should add that I share many of her political views. Yet I don't believe it was necessary to bring those views into the discussion here. It spoiled what could have been a first-rate argument for living peacefully and cooperatively. That said, it's a worthy read and will hopefully prompt more discussion about the topic of slowing down and stopping the madness that keeps us from living our best lives."
1,outdated before I received it,I'm not sure why they would continue to publish a book that is this outdated.
1,Not as announced,"I bought this product believing it was an original RCA LNB as it is announced in the description and is shown in the picture. To my surprise I received a replacement item from another manufacturer. Fortunatly amazon refunded me the cost.This seller must annonce the item as it is (real manufacturer), and not using the original brand without saying it is a replacement part (not original)."
4,Good book to have around.,"I don't have the material in the book memorized, although sometimes I wish I did. It has turned out to be a good reference for me when I need to look up acupressure techniques quickly. (I use it a lot for sudden panic attacks and also mood swings related to Bipolar Disorder.) The book also includes positive affirmations which is nice as well. I'm glad I bought the book. For the price, it's really nice to have."
5,Acupressure for Emotional Healing,"An amazing little book that really works, simple to use with soft quite results.Book arrived as promised in good condition."
3,Disappointed - appears to be functional but isn't,"I received my Creation Station Art Center in November (G51083), and put it together last week. We gave it to our son yesterday for Christmas and to my disappointment one of the legs fell off the chair. The green part which the leg screws into completely came detached from the bottom of the chair. I also, was a little disappointed in the storage area of the table. I thought the slots were made to hold coloring books and really they are about 3 inches to small. I love the idea of this table but for the cost of it, I thought I was getting something more functional."
4,Great Art Table but .....,Great art table but the paint brush holders in the middle and the bins on the side top are cheap plastic. The kids already broke one of the little plastic cups which just leaves a hole in the middle of the table. Also the directions are grouped together with a few steps to do at once. They don't make it clear which steps go first. I found myself undoing a couple of steps. Other than that I really like the table. The kids already picked which side is theirs and can tell by the color of the seat. It has pretty much stopped all the fighting over whose crayon and paper is whose.
5,Magnificent! - A story about doing the right thing!,"Being Hindu and of Indian origin, I found this book especially appealing because it brings out the beauty of India and its primary philosophy of ""Dharma"", which is about doing the right thing. If my children learn nothing else, I want them to learn their virtues. So, if you're looking for a simple yet powerful way to express to your young children the high value of loving and respecting one another and doing the right thing, then this is the book for you!"
5,FindersKeepers - a good book,"I got this book as a gift. As an Indian-American it helped me learn more about my culture. I took this book to school for ""show and share"". All my friends and teachers enjoyed the stories and the nice pictures. Especially the picture with differnt kids holding hands around the world. my teachers also liked that theme. Thank you."
5,Simple and Elegant,Truly an elegant way of bringing out values and culture of Indian society. A great gift idea for children and adults alike.Great illustrations by Smita Turakhia.
4,When O When Will Shea Return To SF?,"I first read Shea in the form of his award-winning story ""Polyphemus"". I read but little fantasy, prefering SF. Shea is a HELLUVA Science Fiction writer, but he is NOT the most prolific around! Trying to get Shea and Vernor Vinge to step up their output is a task dear to my heart!"
1,Sorry but this one doesn't make it.,"Now am a Ventures fan through and through. It pains me to say this but this one isn't worth the trouble.This album you have you believe the Ventures didn't have a drummer. Every track but one (and it's mediocre for other reasons) is disco drum machine right out of a couple decades or so ago. Over produced and over blown. This sounds like someone told them they needed to make a late-80's dance album. Uhhh.. that's not your thing gents!""Journey to the Stars"" is worth having--barely--but the rest just don't cut it for me. ""Out of Limits"" has nothing to do with what you expect--it's a electronic voice overdub monstrosity.I really wish I could say otherwise but I can't. This is BAD. It doesn't even really sound like them--often they're covered by gimmicks and electronics. Come on guys, we know you can do better."
3,"Good, but not great CD.","Several very good songs and many forgettable ones. I enjoyed songs from Sting, Natalie Merchant, No Doubt, and Chris Cornell...and found myself skipping the others to listen to the favorites."
5,My Christmas Favorite,"I've been buying ""Very Special"" Christmas CDs since they first started coming out. This and #1 are my very favorite. There is a wide variety of styles, some gorgeous traditional carols with the twist of the artist, and some all original songs. If you're picky, there's at least one song for you to love. And it goes to a good cause! This is my favorite CD for Christmas. Gotta love it."
3,It's an ok album but not as good as the first one.,"I got this album mainly for ""Ave Maria"", ""I saw three ships"" and ""children go where I send thee."" I like these songs, but I probably would have saved money if I just downloaded each of these songs individually because I don't listen to the other songs on this CD. The other songs are kind of blah."
4,Christmas music,"I bought this CD for the first song, ""I saw 3 ships"" which I heard and had a hard time finding. Its a nice version of this song, by Sting, but the rest of the CD is well just ok.."
2,Mixed Bag,"This is definitely for a younger crowd. Not your traditional sounding songs. I love to listen to all kinds of Christmas music but I have a hard time listening to this from cover to cover. There are a few songs that are awesome, but I would only suggest you buy this CD if you are an avid Christmas CD collector. 1 & 2 are much better."
4,nice tunes,"If nothing else, get the cd just for The Smashing Pumpkins' song ""Christmastime"". Billy Corgan's vocals are incredible. The rest of the cd is nice as well."
4,amazing version of ave maria,"This album is good for the most part. I could do without a few tracks, but the reason I bought this is for the Chris Cornell/Eleven track ""Ave Maria."" The first time I heard it I had goosebumps and my eyes welled up with tears. It's an incredible version of the song, unlike any other I have ever heard...very powerful!"
1,Absolutely Awful,What a major letdown after A Very Special Christmas 1 & 2! These artists sound like they couldn't really be bothered with recording any holiday tunes; whether traditional or secular. Nothing stands out on this collection. Don't bother to waste your time and money.
1,Snoozer Pillow,"Purchased this pillow a little more than a month ago. It was not as full as it appeared in the photos, but turned out to be just what I needed. After about a month, the pillow broke down, filling shifts and goes flat. This isnt worth bothering with-it's junk!!"
4,"Nice pillow, but a little short","This pillow has helped me sleep during my pregnancy. It works well for me but not so well for my husband who is 5'11"""
2,Disappointed with this remote.,"I just received one of these remotes tonight. I was surprised at how large it isbut that doesn't bother me. I have trouble with small buttons anyway, and thesize of it makes it less likely to misplace. I've programmed it so far to controlmy tv, and so far so good. The thing I'm not happy with is the LCD display. Itis flaky. Part of the display is faded out. For example, the display will showthe time, but one of the numbers may just show a dot. Also, the display issupposed to shut off automatically after about 10 seconds. One time itwouldn't shut off untill I removed and put the batteries back.I want to add that I received this remote as a premium from pointsI accumulated by using a credit card, so I am not blaming Amazonfor this. I am going to contact the credit card company andget a replacement. I'll post an update after I receive it."
2,"""Learning"" is hard","The remote is big, but if it really could control all my devices it would be fine. But trying to get this thing to learn some commands from other remotes is frustrating. Some of them work fine, but others you'll spend 10 minutes on and still get nowhere.I should have gone with a better model."
1,No compressors,The item description said there were fasteners with compressors. There were fasteners but no compressors. The item was returned to Amazon.
1,Caveat Emptor,"Poorly designed in three respects. 1. As noted by others, the pot must be in exactly the right spot or you'll have a terrible mess on the countertop. 2. When the pot is removed for pouring, coffee drips from the coffee grounds filter. 3. Pouring is very slow and if you tilt the pot to far, coffee leaks out and spills on to the counter.Also, replacement parts are nearly impossible to find. I have yet to find a replacement gold tone filter. For the comparatively high cost of the unit, it should do much better."
1,if i could -100 stars,this dvd is so boringwhen i watched it for the very first time i watched one of the music videos and when it was done i wanted to watch another music videodon't get me wrong the videos are good quality but as soon as the first one was over it went to an interviewif you don't like that kind of surprise DON'T BUY THIS DVD
1,Yikes....,"This DVD is bad! All pop music is the same nowadays and I really don't see how this group is setting any new standards in the music world. They are bad and that ""Hot"" video or whatever it's called was just overdone. I mean, dancing around outside and shaking your butt? PLEASE.... No Secrets..get a real job. Your average person could sing and dance circles around a group like this. Where is the the option for Zero Stars?"
1,bad dvd,No Secrets was a really bad Dvd. They are OK but everybody is doing the same thing right now but it will probably be better in a couple of years when the pop faze is gone.
5,Love this size...,"I hate the Snapple glass four-packs --- hard to open, heavy, easy to break. So I love this size which iseasy to open and in plastic. Contents are great as usual, the size is terrific."
4,submarine info,"Many of us veterans volunteer our time to acquaint visitors (tourists) with the fleet subs on display at various U.S. locations and, while we once were ""qualified"" on the boats' systems, time has dimmed much of that knowledge. These books, reprints of official U.S. Navy manuals, serve as great refreshers for those who served as well as provide detailed knowledge for those interested in the boats used in WWII and up to two decades later."
3,A little disappointed,"We are a little disappointed by this purchase. The connections between the barres and the legs aren't very sturdy. We have had to tighten the screws several times. I'm afraid to tighten too much for fear of stripping the wood. One leg keeps twisting, we will have to make repairs or modifications to it to make it stay in place. The base of the legs aren't wide enough or something because it will tip over if my daughter leans into her stretches very much. I would not recommend this item for a serious ballerina."
4,An all-around great album...,"I bought this album on amazon, having listened to Joplin's ealier tunes. I have become a fan of his relaxing, yet energizing melodies with almost poetic lyrics reflecting on life. Well, after listening to a few songs, I could see that ""The Future That Was"" was going to be the same thing. My favorites on the album include ""Wonderful Ones"", ""Siddhartha's of Suburbia"", ""I Am Not The Only Cowboy"", and ""The Future That Was"". I gave it four stars, but i would have given it 4 1/2 if i could. This is definatley a great album for anyone who wants to just sit back, relax, and feel good about life."
4,It's good,"Amazingly enough, about 3/4 of the songs on this CD are good and managed to remain on my ipod even today. The trumpet solo in the latter half of ""Dishes"" is hauntingly beautiful and sort of reminds me of the trumpet from Godspeed You! Black Emperor's ""Storm."""
4,He has a future in music,"Love it, and love him. Great lyrics that make you think or remember specific times in your own life."
3,Eh...So So,"I bought this cd based off of other peoples rave reviews on Amazon. While being blown away with the depth and catchiness of ""Useful Music"", this cd just leaves me with that ""I'm eating cold macaroni for the 5th day in a row"" type of feeling. Don't get me wrong, if corporate, emulsified rock (Matchbox 20, ect...) type of music is your thing, go right ahead and buy this cd (GOOO!!!), but if you're like me looking to be reinspired by Josh, it's not going to happen with this cd.update: 1/16/2007 - just found this CD again and listened to it. I don't what happened or if my music taste just changed or whatever, but I'm really rocking to this CD now. Go out and buy it."
2,There is a reason this is out of print.....,"The pianist, Takehisa Tanaka, was way over her head with the likes of Elvin Jones and plays in the standard ""safe"" approach.Jazz lovers move on, a boring cd."
4,Mock Orange ~ the Record Play,"Mock Orange's NEW cd ""The Record Play"" isn't as good as their first Full Length album ""Nines and Sixes"" but is a change for them I say! Other bands like Mock's new cd: ""Lagwagon"", ""get Up Kids"" ""Dynamite Boy"", ""Braid"", ""TrueZero"" and ""the Anniversary"". IF you like their emo/indie style den get the Record Play tape! I give ""Nines and Sixes"" 5 stars though..."
3,Not the greatest Blues Traveler album in the world.,"This is Blues Traveler's 5th album and it shows! This album has nothing that the other 4 don't. IN fact it lacks something. John Popper has always written great lyrics that are humorously ironic (Go Outside and Drive, But Anyway, Whoops) but this album is straight-up pop. It still has John's great harmonica playing and Chan's awesome guitar playing and the songs are honestly catchy and sometimes downright good (Carolina Blues, Most Precarious, Great Big World) -- but they lack the Blues Traveler sound or any kind of new Blues Traveler sound. Blues Traveler really needs to look at what Dave Matthews Band did with their forth album, Before These Crowded Streets. That had a lot of changes to their sound. I still find this one fun and catchy CD with excellent rock music and lyrics. It just doesn't have any speacial qualities to it -- new or old. But a still praise them for provide many good albums and live shows."
1,Only because there's no rating for zero,I found no song on here that was good. This is pretty much album no.4 only there's more songs on here. I just want to take that harmonica to a hammer really bad.
3,Worthwhile but not spectacular,"As a follow-up to ""Four"" Blues Traveler released the over-exposed and under-achieving ""Straight On Till Morning."" With the exception of a select few tracks - ""Canadian Rose"" and ""Most Precarious"" stand out to me - the album feels rushed and unfinished. It falls somewhere in the middle of pumping out great music to keep their true fans happy , and silencing critics who dubbed them one-hit-wonders after ""Four"". ""Carolina Blues"" was a terrific choice as the first single to be released, as it showcased the grittier, more blues-driven sound that was missing (for better or worse) from ""Hook"" and ""Run-Around"". I can't fault Popper & Co. for striking while the iron was hot, but I feel this is their most disappointing album to date."
3,Good summary guide to project management,"While this book is not sufficient to prepare for the PMP certification, it certainly is a useful introduction. It helped me review topics in the field."
2,Basic book,"This is a basic PM book with little insight towards growth of your PM skills. Too much is not covered like SOWs, Activity Charts and such and very little is really touched in depth. Another downside is the Brad story is so simplistic as to be boring. Pass by."
5,A dispatcher's dispatcher,"I gulped at paying $(...) for this little book. But, it's worth every penny. I swear that he wrote it just for me! This is SO good. So many things here I am going to share with my trainees. It is so valuable. I keep thinking that the author is a genius. Of course he is, he's a dispatcher!"
2,Pretty Lame!,"I know there are other reviews that differ, but I found that for [$&&], (used!) it was a pretty small book. Some of the information was valuable, but it was filled with sappy poems, war stories and the like. There wasn't much in this book that identified the specific stress that police dispatchers suffer from. Just a few cliche articles about stress in general. I was very disappointed in this book, left it here in dispatch and found several of my co-workers felt the same. Comments I heard were ""you paid how much for this book?..."""
4,Great Pedal!,Not much to say really... other than the pedal does what MXR claims it to do. I Like it!Built Like a tank and nice finish!The two channels are nice and the distortion can be thin to fat and grungy.It will also sightly fatten your tone with or without distortion.Only note of warning is it does sound differently on various amps. I did use it on anSWR 550X and it did not sound as good as it does on my Traynor Dyna Bass 800H. It alsosound great on the Bugera BVP5500 and MarkBass LMT 800.
4,Very Solid,"Well, gotta tell u something, I heard about Danny Howells, but I never expected anything like this. Danny was just as good as Anthony Pappa. First CD is pretty deep and dark, just what is needed to warm u up. 130 bpm is an average beat rate of CD 1. Cd 2 is more like 130-133 bpm and it is alot more progressive. Second disk is very much like Oakenfold - Seaman style. Both CD's mixed very smoothly with great track selection. Tell u what, if u liked ""Nu Breed 1"", u should buy this one too."
3,CLEAN and DULL,"i've tried to like this cd (which is why i bought it) but after 3 listens i find the shining moments here to be too few and far between to warrant much of a rating. gonna have to run with nico here.....this is a pretty dull, lifeless affair. as for one of our rave reviewers...i have to wonder what is a professional trance listener? are we kidding ourselves? you shouldn't have to be paid to listen to great music...but maybe we have a new category here. i just question whether ""professional trance listeners"" should be reviewing music under customer reviews since ""getting paid"" might somehow influence the amount ofstars one gives. but then again....we ARE surely joking!"
4,Good solid mix by Danny,"Just got this CD yesterday, lots of good progressive house tracks on it. Those of you expecting a cookie-cutter trance mix will be disappointed, as this mix has lots of deep trance and house tracks on it (Helsinki being one of my current favorites). Some missteps tho, like the DJ Dan track (completely out of place), and the vocals on Reach Inside are just too cheezy for me. All in all a well programmed and mixed CD set, also check out Renaissance Ibiza mixed by Deep Dish if you like music in this style."
5,incredibly deep and dark!,"This 2 CD set continues the tradition of excellence from Global Underground. Danny Howells might not be as familiar as Sasha, digweed or tenaglia but he shows with this mix why he is going to be huge very soon!The first CD is a warm up set . mostly deep house with some tech-house thrown in. i especially like the DJ Dan and science dept tracks.CD 2 is peak time material. killer tracks include midnight on west 27th, doomsday & the nukem vs chalab track. This one will not leave your CD player anytime soon!!!!!!The mixing is incredible on this set. no glitches anywhere :)"
3,Good but overhyped,"After reading the reviews for this set of discs, one would expect it to be excellent. Well, they are alright with moments of excellence. There are some very dull tracks on these CDs, and some very good tracks. Overall though, what makes these CDs notable is how un-notable they are. I mean they are fine, but that's it. Maybe it is because I am comparing this to all of the other GU CDs, some of which are simply mind blowing...."
4,Must have book,"The item includes 4 volumes for a total of ~800 pages. It gives the basic knowledges on TEM, spectrometry, diffraction, imaging, and also on the instrument itself. However the chapter are not going too much in details about the physics, but addresses clearly what is important to keep in mind when using a TEM. Therefore it is a must have book for any user.I recommend to complete with other books like those from RF Egerton, especially for any EELS related topic that includes the thickness measurement of a sample. Other works from I. Pozsgai may also help in simplifying the mass-thickness method."
4,A mature and beautiful album,"This is a beautiful album. Not all of the songs are perfect, sure, and some are notably deficient in comparison with the others, but as for those others - boy!The title track is an achingly honest song, beautiful and painful at once and more moving with each listen. The ballads with Linda Ronstandt are not of the same standard as those they shared on her excellent '89 album ""Cry Like a Rainstorm..."", but they are still head and shoulders above most pop ballads you will hear.Although some of the songs are not stand-outs for me personally, it must be said that the entire album does have a lovely, almost dreamlike sound to it which is actually very effective in its flow from track to track, and that is something that, I think, is becoming ever rarer these days in pop albums.Buy this album, give it several listens, and I challenge you not to become seduced by it."
5,"A Special Voice, A Special Musicality","This is one of my favorite cds. A huge fan of Aaron, I have followed his musical path for a long time. He excels in many different styles of music, but the songs written for this cd really showcase his voice beautifully.Not only are the songs well-written, but his interpretation and passionate input raise the effort to a higher level.A must-listen; a must-own."
2,Way too commercial! OK not great,"You may like this CD at first but like most commercial sounding CDs, you'll get tired of it easily. Most of the songs sound like one another. The majority of them do not have much depth to speak of. The arrangement in ""First time I ever saw your face"" is just terrible. It totally ruined the song. Neville is obviously trying to make some quick $$ with this CD."
4,I am satisfied,This product will do perfect for what I needed. The only unusual thing is the double zip. However i have already made my adjustment to it.
1,Christian propanganda,The last cut is great if you like Fox news but we're not all Christians and some of us are offended by the denial of separation of church and state.
2,"Good, vintage Lasalle except for....","I wish she had kept the song There's no Separation in the bedroom. She sounds like she is channelling the late and (hateful) Jerry Falwell. Come on Denise you are better than that. Not only is it undemocratic but she supports censorship (Harry Potter) and opposes same sex marriage. The irony is in a ""Christian"" state her sexually charged music would likely be banned from the airways. Be careful what you wish for. For me the blues is summed up by the Sweet Betty song, Live and let live. Sweet Betty reigns!"
4,BURN CD,"This is my second one. Someone lost the first one I had. Couldn't be without anymore. Had to have it. Even used, it was great. I will always come here first to buy anything I need or want."
1,I expected better from Jo Dee.,"If I wanted pop I would have bought Britney Spears. I will next time. I was incredibly disappointed with this album. It was incredibly bland, and Jo Dee seemed to forget she markets herself as a country singer. It wasn't even worth keeping in the collection, I've already sold it on ebay."
3,Not Bad But....,"I will readily admit to not being a huge country fan, but I picked this CD up on the strength of the title track. Originally recorded by Austrailian Tina Arena (who also wrote the ballad) 'Burn' is a great song, needing only a mediocre voice to help it shine. Jo Dee does at least that. Her vocals are good although a bit twangy for my tastes, but the CD is still and enjoyable listen. 'Bring the Rain' is also a truly lovely song. I still prefer the Tina Arena version of 'Burn', and know that once she hits in the U.S. Tina will be huge, both as a vocalist and a writer."
4,A great second album,"As an avid fan, I was not disappointed in the least when I heard songs from this album. If anything, her voice is stronger and more confident."
1,Cliches abound,"If you like a heaping helping of cliches with your tepid brand of country, your search is over!Sorry, but that's the truth and the truth as we all know hurts.This album does no one any favors except for the record company. It doesn't even do Jo Dee or the myriad of songwriters any favors because they won't be able to look at themselves in the mirror. This CD is all about the cash till ring of success; yet ironically how many CD's sold never amounts to any REAL achievement. Can't say enough bad things about this CD.My advice to Jo Dee; play it from the heart; scrap the god-awful cliches and sing about REAL life."
1,BURN-Tina Arena,I rather buy the IN DEEP album which features the originalBURN... from Tina Arena.Thats all I can say...
4,That's The Way country should be,"Great country music! I give it four stars instead of five because I don't like country that much. If you're a country boy or girl, think about getting this one."
1,JO DEE IS THE THIRD RATE UNKNOWN!!!,"TINA ARENA HAS BEEN FAMOUS IN CERTAIN PARTS OF THE WORLD, ASIA, EUROPE, AUSTRALIA AND HAD A RECENT TOP 1 BILLBOARD DANCE SONG CALLED ""NEVER (PAST TENSE)"". OBVIOUSLY JO DEE DOESN'T HAVE THE YOUTHFUL VOICE THAT TINA HAS AND SHE IS NOWHERE NEAR TINA! AND YES, SHE STILL LOOKS LIKE A BATTERED WOMAN! TINA HAS LEGIONS OF FANS AROUND THE WORLD. JO DEE DOESN'T MAKE AN IMPACT!DON'T GRAB A COPY OF THIS ALBUM!GET TINA ARENA'S ""IN DEEP"" WHICH CONTAINS THE ORIGINAL ""BURN"" AND ""JUST ME"" HER LATEST!"
1,"Messina owes that song to the ""starlet""","Yeah! Jo Dee owes that song to the woman who gave her the recognition, and that is TINA ARENA! Whether you like it or not, Jo Dee is never gonna get somewhere. Tina's much younger. Fans are jealous because Tina is the one who wrote the song. Tina is Australia's Highest Selling Female Artist in Australian history and Jo Dee is what? nothing! haha! TINA WILL RULE and she has a new album on the way!"
4,Burn - - - An Entertaining and Uplifting CD,"Burn is characterized by Jo Dee's unique and crystal clear vocals. She exhibits great enthusiasm in her singing and again proves she is one of the best country singers around. Most of the songs have a good melody and perky beat, and lyrics are positive and do not encourage any vices (ha, ha). That's The Way is a very, very catchy tune. Bring on the Rain with Tim McGraw is a slower song combining two great voices. I will say that at this point, I prefer her previous CD, I'm Alright. Pictures of Jo Dee with a sexy look contrast a little with a conservative image generally projected."
2,boringboringboring,"Yes, she has a great voice, but this entire CD is so overproduced, so lifeless, so very boring that I had to force myself to listen to the entire thing - searching desperately for a track that measures up to the voice. She sounds as bored as I was on every song. I hope she wakes up soon before we all fall asleep."
3,Burn This One,"I loved Jo Dee's first two CDs so much, I looked forward to the release of this one and pre-ordered it. I guess that makes my disappointment that much more bitter. There's not a bad track on the Cd but there's not a really good one either, kind of like pablum. Jo Dee, dump Tim Mcgraw, forget pop stardom and go back to what made you so popular with your original fans!"
2,so-so,"This album, in my opinion, is not the highlight of Jo Dee Messina's career. I didn't like most of the songs. The title track, ""Burn,"" was pretty good though. Definitely the best in the whole record. Still, the other version of ""Burn,"" performed by Australian artist Tina Arena, is much more superior to this one."
5,Must buy,"Listerning to this album is like falling in love again. From the beginning of break up, to falling in love, then to the final song's lyric of 'tomorrow is another day' give u a full package of love. Song such as 'That's the way it is', 'Burn', and 'Angeline' are highly recommended."
3,NOT THAT great NOT THAT bad !,"this DVD is not as good as it sounds, the actual concert part is stupid, the only cool thing about this is when he shows you his scars on his legs on the boat, the Heaven song done by Nick himself. I still don't understand why Nick was featured in this DVD, i mean, we just want Aaron, not nick! but they do make a funny duet when they are together. When it shows ""Aaron eating a Cajun, he ..... describes what's on his plate, he doesn;t actually EAT 'em. I perfer the AARON'S PARTY - LIVE IN CONCERT much better. He talks alot more in that, and i love the part when he went swimming with the fishes. The 1th b'day party part is dump, coz it's black and white! and the concert part, well, wat can i say, the stage is real small. Hey, i'm just being honest.k, hope that helped ya!~Eva"
4,"Aaron Carter ""oh Aaron""","Aaron Carter reminds me of young entertainers/rappers back in a time where they were only interested in making sure you have a good time. Not making music for personal therapy. Everybody else is so busy airing their dirty laundry or cleaning out their closets. My only pet peeve is that Aaron needed to take more breaks in between sets, however, so as not to compromise the quality of his voice. The video break featuring ""I'm all about you"" is Aaron Carter at his best! The Jimmy Neutron single ""Leave it up to me"" is another favorite!"
5,Aaron ROCKS!!,"This DVD is Really cool. It has a lot of songs from his cd's, interviews, and much more!! Aaron is Really Talented, and if you don't believe me, listen to him in his concert! Well, AC Rocks and so does this Video!! I think you will like it if you buy it, just like I do. Aaron Carter RULES!!"
1,Oh Arron?,"Yes Oh Aaron STFU!!! Stop making fake music you don't even write, just dance around and lipsync like a complete idiot. My god, Dimebag was shot, someone release a few psycho's in an Aaron carter concert PLEASE!"
2,bad brush,This brush is stiff and rough to the touch. It's flat surface and stiff bristles make it difficult to pick up color and apply it to your face. I would NOT recommend this brush to anyone. Even Elfs $1 brushes are higher quality.
3,"Fungi, mysteries and fascinations","This book is a very good overview of the kingdom Fungi. With an easy vocabulary usage, the authors were able to entertain the reader with very well done chapters. Although some of the topics could have been streesed a little deeper, the book is perfect for college students enrolled in classes such as introductory mycoloy and fungal systematics."
5,A beautiful book on Vivekananda....,"This biography on Vivekananda captivates the reader immensely. It starts of in the early life of this remarkable soul and ends with a few priceless sayings of this colossal figure. This book also contains a glossary on Sanskrit words for the uninitiated reader.Surprisingly, this book contains no chapters. But this should not put the reader off. The sub-headings in this book makes this work an easy read but the lack of photographs is a minor shortcoming. However, Vivekananda's life is a remarkable one and this should captivate the reader deeply."
5,London map guide,This book is a must for those visiting London. It is easy to read and is a necessary reference when navigating the meandering streets cape of the City. I'd be lost without it!
2,Not Worth the Money,"In this CD, Marlon Jordan has attempted to follow the jazz style of Wynton Marsalis and his groups. However, Marlon falls way short of anything comparable to the quality of music played by Marsalis. The songs on this CD really aren't all that pleasing to the ear. While Jordan does show some impressive speed while playing, the overall quality of his songs and playing does not appear to be all that good. At times he almost sounds like a good amateur musician. It is understandable that each musician has his own style of playing, especially while performing ad lib solos, but the saxophone player's solos are pretty annoying with the sudden loud low-note bursts. Maybe other Marlon Jordan CD's are very good, but this one isn't worth the time or money."
5,Good replacement cable.,I'm happy with my purchase of this cable. Good quality. Made well. Does what it is supposed to.
3,will not fit if obd2 port is recessed,"It's an ok replacement, but if your obd2 port is a bit recessed in a trim panel this will not plug into it. The cable on this one exits to the side of the plug body, where as the original scangage2 exits the rear center."
4,Received as Ordered,Just as advertised on web site. Works fine for the unit so that I can use it in two vechicles.
2,Cheap imitation of original,Cable came in with a cheap RJ45 connector. The tab broke and I had to put another one on. I would purchase the original from ScanGuage.
1,Starclucked,"Boy,what a heartbreaking disappointment this action figure was.From the time I opened the box,I was struck down in regards to the poor quality of craftmanship.This thing looks NOTHING like Dirk Benedict.DAMN,His skin color looks like death warmed over (not really,he doesn't look that good!).Skin tone is all wrong,and he doesn't look anything like the action figure on the box.The one in the box looks like some old guy whose skin is suffering from all types of disorders.Hair color and eye colors are wrong too.Stay away from this and the rest of the 12"" action figures from this maker,they suck!The helmet is wrong as well as the black and gold trim on the collar and lower tunic.Very poorly designed and produced....heartbreaking to all REAL Battlestar Galactica fans."
3,"A great compilation of oral histories, but bad conclusions.","Excellent chapters on the behind the scenes aspect of the resistance, including social services, where women dominated the field. The book does not, however, include food riots and worker's strikes. These are two areas of resistance that women also participated in.For the most part Weitz is willing to let her interviews speak for her, with informative results. Her own analysis and conclusions show feminist leanings, and are far from objective. The concluding chapter digresses into a barrage of stereotypes and gender comparison.Still, if one ignores the author's own remarks and concentrates on the primary sources, this is a worthwhile book."
2,Bits too short!,"Good price but bits are too short, too small, and low quality. If you are a handyman and just want these to put in your toolbox for an emergency around the house, then I say buy them. If you need to drill holes (more than one) in concrete then keep looking."
4,Cool to have it THIS HOT!,"I bought this one on a lark, of course accustomed to the Global Underground quality, I was again PLEASED, to say the least! Nick Warren is not someone whos work I was fimiliar with but boy does this guy know his spins! He is obviously someone who has enjoyed a few years on the dancefloor to be so good at controlling it! From start to finish he surprises you with some seemingly repetitious beats moving you in and out of an audio venture that becomes embeddded in your mind and ""keeps you at the rave"" a little longer..He has a vocal piece in the beginning explaining that people do music for their souls and not for the money, this album assures you his heart is here, right where it ought to be. He's added another spoken clip later in the album about drug's effects on music and the musicians.He is VERY conscious of the buzz as he plays for you and this only adds to the creditibility of this album and making it well worth it's weight!"
5,Off the Hook!!!!,"I'm not a man of a million words , and I don't sell music for a living , but if you like cutting edge trance.....2 songs are so-so..the rest is mind-bending."
4,an enjoyable mix of progressive house,"Well, apparently, trance is not hip anymore. All major DJs featured on the Global Underground series seem to be moving away from trance and focusing more on house. This set, for example, is practically devoid of the kind of trance Warren used in his previous GU mixes. The set, just like all GUs, is very consistent and gives the listener more than 2 hours of intense, hypnotic sound. I can't give it five stars though because it does not have truly great tracks (with the exception of Fluke's Bullet), and, overall, it lacks variety. Truly great mixes contain a wider range of genres. Sasha's GUs, for example, have both melodic trance like BT and deep house. Digweed's Bedrock set has stuff ranging from minimal house to trance like Heaven Scent. Anyway, this mix, though not the best in the GU series,is clearly worth having."
3,"Great tracks, bad mixing.","Well, there's not much to say here. Its Nick Warren in his fourth Global Undergound CD. The tracks here are top notch. No cheese and no anthems. Just what you expected from the Boxed boys. There's just this minor problem: The mixing. It sucks. I can't put it any more simpler than that. No doubt all tracks will have you dancing, but the transition from one track to another is at times awful. Heck, some of the track aren't even beatmatch! Even a bedroom DJ can perform this basic function. Other times he just fades out one track then fades in another track. Cheap shot. I know this is a ""live"" album, but take a listen at Sasha's Ibiza album. Its also live and the mixing is fluid and a lot better than Nicks. This CD just doesn't have any fluid. Is it worth it? I recommend you borrow it from a friend."
5,inspector morse,"John Thaw is Inspector Morse in Oxford England. He brings something different to the table when solving a murder at Oxford, but he is something more then that. He's a grumpy man who does not listen to his superiors, goes on doing what he needs to do to solve a crime, does not care what people think of him and still yells at his right hand man Lewis, who is very loyal. There are three stories in each set, I have all but one, and they are hard to follow, which means the plot has to much going on with a lot of red herrings and to many characters. But you can not help but watch to the very end to see who done it and why. Because of Inspector Morse I am going to Oxford to tour around that place where so many murders take place!"
2,"great product, but not packaged well","I love the Inspector Morse series, and I have ordered a number of the sets. However, I was forced to return this current set, as well as two other sets that I ordered at the same time. The reason for this is because the episodes contained in the various sets are not identified, and episodes are repeated in different sets. I found two episodes in this current set were contained in a previous set that I had ordered. Why the episodes are packaged in this manner is a mystery to me. It severely limits my ability to order future sets, because I cannot determine which episodes I am ordering, and whether there are repeat episodes in the set."
1,Dull book,VERY dull reading. I can not think of seventeen more words to say about this dull book. It was not worth the money.
3,A good choice for gender scholars,An interesting read for those interested in gender and the body. I'm glad I read it but it is not in my core area of interests so not a particularly memorable read.
2,"See my review of ""Twilight Zones,"" also by Susan Bordo","Summary:2/3 good (on body images, eating disorders)1/3 bad (a terrible, god-awful essay on the purported debate in feminist philosophy)"
3,"OVERWEIGHT, INTELLECTUALLY THAT IS.","Seemingly a random collection of personally motivated opinion, quotation, and ""I don't know whut all!"" (Shades of Herb Schriner.) Lots of cerebral cellulite though on the whole it carries more meaning than almost all of the Academic/Gender Feminist writings. It is, to be sure, not obscure in the extreme. (Parenthetically, I believe I would like Bordo.) Cheers,Ed W., PhD. (social philosophy), Chicago 1962; Doktor Rerum Naturum, Freiburg im Breisgau 1965 (like, applied physics dudes)"
1,Not for those interested in the speeches.,"Listen to some of the best written, most artfully delivered, and important speeches in our nation's history overlayed with a cheesy, soporific elevator-music score. Sorry I spent money on it."
5,Classy and gorgeous,"I have the Tea Rose curtains in other colours and sizes as well as doilies and other items from Heritage lace. They are a dream to launder - pull out of the washer, hang them back on the rod and let them air dry. They are so classy and just gorgeous. I only have Heritage Lace on all my windows, tables et al. Great selection and timeless beauty."
5,Terrific remake of the 1978 cult classic!,"A remake that actually surpasses the original classic! This one has it all: thrills, chills, laughs, movie in-jokes! A terrific ride. Kudos to all, especially the writer and director, who do justice to the material while putting their own original spin on it. Check it out!"
2,Cheesy horror film,"I baught this film for Soleil Moon Frye only and she does an excellent job in this cheesy horror film that is not scary and the pirahnas a little rubbery, also bad acting by William Katt."
4,Aldis 7 to 7,"From Dorothy Aldis, the published author of several children's books of the 1920s and 30s comes 7 to 7. A short 1931 book covering the daily life of an unnamed toddler girl. It's an A-Z alphabet learning book with each page containing that letter and a cute rhyme which is accompanied by lithographic artwork as we journey along with the girl. A book to be read to children to help them recognize the alphabet or a fun whimsical book to be read by children who are first learning how to read."
3,disappointed,"I saw the TV Special and the CD is missing some of the better pieces of music. Disppointing. I thought the CD would contain all of the music from the TV special and purchased it before its release. Had i known that songs like ""The Heart is Slow to Learn"" would not be included, I would have saved my money - the recorded songs are pretty much the same pieces that have been recorded before."
5,loved it !!!!,This was a great read !!!!!! Jewel Dartt is now one of my fav.The book cover looks bad but the story was soooo good.
4,An excellent fantasy and magic story,This is definetely a book for magic lovers. It was hard to put down once I had started. I think Rose Rita is a very practical girl and smart. I say this book is open for any age.
5,A GREAT BOOK,"This book is so amazing. The plot is as well thought of as the characters. This book is so gripping. I am glad what happens to Gert Bigger in the end. If you buy the book, you'll find out what happens. This is a great mystery. You should BUY it!"
3,"Rosa Rita,Mrs Zimmerman, and the MAGIC RING.","Rosa Rita had nothing to do this summer, because her best friend Lewis is going to a camp. But her friend Mrs. zimmermman had a letter from her cousin, that he was dead, and the farm he had it has passed to her. And he had also found a magic ring. Mrs. Zimmermman invited Rosa Rita to try and find out more about the MAGIC RING.I did like the book, because I did'nt have anything better to do in class.I recomended the book if you don't have anythig better to do, but if you have opportunity to play soccer, or any of your favorite sports don't read it."
4,A Good Mystery book,I think this book was a great mystery book. I would never of thought Mrs.Z being the chicken. Rose Rita was in a great advanture. It was a great book and also a great mystery.
1,didn't get it,my order was cancelled and money on CC returned. Do you have it in stock now????????????????????????? Steve Nance
4,Only Heaven SOARS,"I was a big Ricky Ian Gordon fan when I heard his song ""I Never Knew"" on the THE AID'S QUILT SONGBOOK and then even a bigger fan once I heard his songs on Audra McDonald's album WAY BACK TO PARADISE. Then I found BRIGHT EYED JOY and I became completely consumed by that lbum which pretty much had me running to every store to find ONLY HEAVEN. I was so intrigued by that album and I still am, because it takes the songs that he wrote from Langston Hughes poetry and creates a performance around them. I say a performance because its not a really a show and it's not really a concert. But there is one thing to say about it...that it's amazing and it really soars to Heaven."
2,Cheap product,"You get what you pay with this product. When I got mine I think that it was manufactured wrong because as soon as I opened it and extended the rabbit ears I tried adjusting the antenna and it broke off like an uncooked angel hair pasta strand! Luckily I got a full refund though. If you do get this product just be VERY careful when adjusting the rabbit ears! (My friend has this same product and says great, so perhaps mine was just a faulty product."
2,Not my favorite!,"Poor reception, but it might just be where I live. I live right next to a big hill which may be hindering the signal. But it overlooks the valley on 3 sides, so who knows! I'd say go for a better quality antenna."
2,Too small to do the job,Too small to work for me - had to go get a Radio Shack antenna - Thought I could save a few bucks - didn't happen for me
1,did not work,I bought this item based on reviews. It seemed like a great deal. This did not work at all very disappointed.
4,RCA,"I'm pretty sure this is a good buy, but there are so many other factors that contribute to whether or not you will pick up channels."
2,Not very good reception,"I only seem to get about 1 or 2 channels using this antenna. I've tried turning the dial, moving it around my room, etc. On some days I can get 2 channels, maybe 3 at most. But mostly it's 1 that comes out clear."
4,Broadcast still exists?!,"And it's awesome!! I have this beautiful 42"" HD TV and all I was watching on it was streaming content; it never even dawned on me to get an antenna until my Dad pestered. I popped this baby on and suddenly I have 88 Digital channels! And my major networks come in beautifully in a HD signal. Of course, since it is broadcast, you do get the occasional pixelation; but that easy enough to fix with a quick flip of the dial or twist of the bunny ears. :)"
1,Next to worthless,"This basic antenna looked good coming out of the box and the two antenna extend a satisfying length, but it only found four over the air stations regardless of how a positioned it or switched the little selector knob. I saw zero difference is signal quality (not good) with the four stations it did pull in regardless of what position I put the selector knob at.At the same time I had ordered another over the air antenna from Imagine, the ICI-102 Hi-Def UHF Planar Antenna.That one is very sleek and modern and only 8""x6""x.25"" and there are no selector knobs to adjust, no antenna to extend and it pulled in 19 stations and it didn't seem to matter how I positioned it.Obviously, I kept the Imagine and returned this RCA model.The Imagine was $30 versus $13 for the RCA, but $30 for an antenna that works, is small and looks good is a bargain and $13 for an antenna that doesn't work is not."
1,Non-standard coaxial cable pin connector,The connector pin for the coaxial cable was non standard (too thick) to fit in any standard DTV box.
3,Our Bad,"In fairness to the manufacturer, the product was not usable due to issues on our end. It was worth the try."
2,not worth it,got this hooked up and can only recieve one channel which is only 3 miles away. Tried to tweek it but to no avail. I would send it back but for the price I paid it would cost that much to get it out of here.
1,No Reception,"I did not receive ANY reception with this antenna. Perhaps it was due to the area I live in or my TV; however, I have a newer TV."
1,rca antenna,the detailed was ok but i have tried and tried to get it to work but i cant get nothing on it not single chanel dont no y or if im doing something wrong just did not have any luck with it.
1,bad product,"This product sucks, it is not even worth the price to send it back, it would cost more than the refund for the product.This needs to be taken off shelves!!!!"
1,Does not work well for HDTV,I find this product quite useless. The reception is unacceptable. Very grainy and only a few stations were received. Very disappointing result.
2,Reception,"To my surprize, after scanning channels it could only find 8 channels. 4 out of 8 picture captured were clear and the rest were tiled and scrambled. During scanning I could see there were more than 100 channels to view. Unfortunately, this antena is not strong enough to capture the signals. I tried it by relocating the antena with different angles and that didn't work either."
2,Didn't work for me,This antenna did not work for me. I only got 5 channels. Sometimes they are crystal clear but most times there is too much static to watch. I also get a low signal strength a lot of the time. I didn't get any network channels other than Fox. The other 4 channels where the HSN and other channels I never watch.
3,Indoor Antenna,We bought it as a cheap option for our second tv. It's no better than the $10 antenna I bought 5 years ago. It gets the job done.
4,Antenna works great,"I am getting much better reception. Before, half the channels were not working well. Now,I only have to adjust the antenna sometimes for some of the channels."
3,Okay Antenna,Works most of the time. Where I live it does not pick up ABC. Signal receiving seems to be affected by the weather
3,"Decent product, decent price",Did what it was supposed to do. Didn't expect it to work in all corners of the house since it was pretty cheap. Neutral.
3,Haven't gotten the results other claim,My experience falls short of most of the other reviews I read. Perhaps I need to extend the cable and position the unit near the bedroom window.?
4,Changed my Mind,"I originally reviewed this a while back with one star since I couldn't connect it to my digital converter box. Months later, tried again and with a LOT of pushing and manipulating, I finally connected it. However, one major station would not come in and I could get it with the TV rabbit ears so I stored it away again.I recently bought a new 19 inch digital TV and connected this antenna and placed it near a window. The picture is great and I only occasionally have to make adjustments to the antenna. So I wouldn't recommend it for an old analog TV with a converter box but I would recommend it for a digital TV. I would buy this antenna again."
4,Excellent Value for Price,antenna provides excellent coverage for FM reception in the remote area that required additional antenna. Aside from included dipole with new Pioneer audio-video receiver model VSX-1020.
4,Review for the RCA ANT121 Indoor Antenna,My experience has been great with the antenna it brings in good transmission I enjoy the stations I am able to receive because of the reception I get with the RCA antenna. I would recommend it to anyone that needs a good antenna for their television.
4,Check what you are in range to get first,"Before buying this, check with TVFool or AntennaWeb on what channels you are likely to get. We live right outside a major metro area, so we were able to pick up all our local stations (CBS, FOX, NBC, ABC, PBS, and a few weird ones), but if you live in solitude, don't expect to get everything. The Antenna worked fine for us, picked up almost every channel those websites said we could. We had some issues on channels dropping out if you stood right in front of it, or when a train went by, but nothing terrible. After we canceled our cable service, and they finally came and shut it down, I tested plugging the cable back in just for the hell of it, and amazingly we were able to get the same channels as the antenna got, only clearer. We ended up returning these because of that, so I would recommend you give that a test first, and if it doesn't work, this antenna did it's job fine, too."
5,~~more than I ever could have hoped for~~,"After getting sick and tired of having my cable bill go up a few times a year I decided to get rid of my cable tv for good. Someone told me about this antenna and said they got great reception with it and several channels too. For the price I figured I couldn't lose. I LOVE IT! I get several channels and they are crystal clear. NBC, CBS, FOX, ION, CW and those are just the ones I can think of. There are 10 to 12 others that I don't really watch. Every once in a while I have to change the channels on the antenna but that's not a big deal. I live in a condo and I thought I might not get a very good picture but it's great and I'll never pay for cable tv again!"
1,Not even one channel,"I suspect the title says it all. Tried hooking this up to every tv in the house: nada. If there are free HD channels out there, this antenna isn't picking them up. Save your money."
1,2 Things,"I was originally attracted to this by the price and by the positive customer reviews. But after I received it, I packaged it up to be returned within a half hour.Two things I found frustrating about this product:(1) I tried for 20 minutes to get a signal in a place I had previously gotten a good signal. I adjusted the antennae in every imaginable position, with no luck. Also used the switch to see if that would do anything. The best I got was NBC flashing between a blue screen and a frozen picture with no sound.(2) While adjusting the antennae, my hands were left with a graphite residue that I had to wash off. Even if this antenna worked, I would have returned it for that reason. I shouldn't have to wash my hands every time I adjust this.I would caution against this purchase."
4,18 channels with great reception,"I live in a major city, in a regular house, the tv is some 20' from the nearest window, and I have flawless reception of some 18 digital stations and a few radio stations.We dropped our expensive cable and replaced it with this $15 antenna today, and my tv's auto scan quickly found nbc and ion, that is good enough for me. The reception is just great, and no worse than it was with wired cable, from which we only had basic channels anyway"
3,Average Antenna,"I think it's fine for the money, but I have another RCA with a slightly different design out in my living room that does a MUCH better job than this one. It took quite a bit of tweaking to get the most channels, and it still didn't grab my local CBS station. Not a big deal, as this is just backup for weather issues when the DISH goes out, but I had hoped for better."
4,great for the price,"Yes, as some other reviews state the device does seem a lil' delicate or flimsy. However, it does the job just fine. If you can't pick up local channels then it may just be bad luck as far as your location or obstructions between the antenna and the signals. Obviously, try different positions and it helps to place the antenna high or near a window. For the price, it is great. I've been using this model for several months and it works as well as any other antenna I've had."
2,OK for urban areas,"This is a good antenna for urban areas and those not too far from the broadcast towers. For those that live in more rural areas farther away from the towers, this will not work very good at all for you. I live about 40 miles from all channels broadcast towers. I can pick up maybe 1 or 2 prime channels. When I moved to the Philadelphia suburbs, it works fine."
4,Great Antenna for DTV,I attempted to switch to DTV (over the air) awhile ago using a few of the 'flat' antennas with NO luck. I could get a few stations but in general the signal was poor or choppy. I had written off DTV for me - assuming my home or location was just not adventagous to receiving a quality signal.Last month for Christmas I purchansed one of these antenna for my son (who lives with his mom) and it was the best experience i'd have with DTV. So I decided to try again for my house. Fantastic! I am able with only slight placement changes to get all of the channels with at least a fair signal -- one that doesn't cut out so often it makes watching tv a major fail. THIS antenna was so good I bought another one for my mom as well!
1,Poor Reception,I live on the outskirts of Dallas/Fort Worth and thought that this would work for me. It only picked up 2 of about 15 stations available in my area. Don't waste your money on this one. I bought the same brand but one that has a power amplifier in it. 100% better.
2,Not enough power,"This antenna did not give me the basic channels that I knew should be available. After swapping it with an amplified antenna, I received 10 more channels, more that expected. Take into consideration how far away you are from the antennas on the mountain in deciding what type of antenna you need."
2,very disappointed,"I read the reviews and it seemed that this would work almost anywhere. I live in the city and cannot get a single signal on either tv. I figured if it worked for people who had mountains between them and the closest tv tower, it should work for me with numerous stations within 10 miles. No such luck. I would love to free myself from cable, but if I can't get my local networks with an antenna, that's never going to happen."
3,It's an okay antenna,It did not find 13 channels or more. I found the same 4 channels I had with a really old pair of bunny ears. It was a little clearer reception for those channels but that was all.
5,Works like the higher priced models,Sometimes the old fashioned was is still the best (And cheapest) This thing brought in as many channels as the higher priced signal booster kind.
4,works fine,Already had one and needed another so I purchased one through Amazon. It is not amplified but works well for my needs.
5,Works fine,"Works fine. Gets all my local channels and was easy to install and set up. I live in the suburbs, so I'm not trying to get any long range channels."
4,Does a Good Job,"I bought a Tivax 7"" portable digital TV for use during power outages. I'm only 4.5 miles from the center of a large city and the included antenna was only able to get 7 digital channels. I looked for a non-powered, indoor antenna and I came across this one from RCA. It has pretty good ratings from others and I figured since the price was right, it wouldn't put me out if it failed to work. To my surprise, I was able to increase the number of channels that I could see to 12! Not bad!"
1,JUNK!,"I'm living in the middle of a city, where the reception is suppose to be good, I'm only getting 3 channels, and the quality of them is not even good. Total waste of money"
3,meh..,"I bought this unit to replace a set of rabbit ears that were attached to a newer digital box. It works, but not as well as i had hoped. Really not much better than what we were using. May be a bad location that cannot be changed(waiting room, auto shop) so we are just gonna stick with it."
4,works like a dandy in my camera,i have a canon a75. 512mb is more than enuff storage for me. price/performance is great too! what can u say about a CF memory card? it has tons of storage and works great.
5,Works!,"Well, not much to say, except that it stores the pics I put on it. Being working fine in my Canon digicam."
2,It's a ok card but there are much better once,I own a Canon 10D with a Sandisk ultra 512 and a lexar 512 12x.The lexar is just slow basicly i would say go for the fast ultra 2.But the lexar works fine only it takes time.
3,Too polished too soon,"Debut albums used to be statements of purpose: ""This is who I am, and here's why you should pay attention."" Now they spring forth full-blown, competent, confident -- and consummately generic. At 21, Jamie Blake has all the right moves: Unlike so many young singer-songwriters (e.g., Ben Kweller of Radish), she can genuinely write and sing. She rocks out when appropriate and quiets down for the quiet parts. Her lyrics and delivery are girl-power-strong yet sensitive. There isn't a false note in this collection of radio-friendly alt-rock. Blake would make a terrific opening act; you might even remember a few of her melodies enough to hum them while waiting for the headliner to appear. But there's no vision here, nothing to distinguish her from yesterday's Juliana Hatfield disciples -- or from tomorrow's. By album's end, you still have little sense of who she is or why she makes a difference. Or why, for that matter, she deserves to be a headliner."
3,Great Price - meets my needs,"After looking for an M2 memory stick at BestBuy, I found this at Amazon and am very pleased... saved me about 30 dollars, and it provides plenty of room for pictures and music for my Sony Ericson phone."
4,micro!,I was so excited when I received this item and am still using it. My only issue is that the adapter is soo small and doesn't fit into any computer laptop/desktop I have. I cannot take any pictures off my card. I am still glad I bought this item and it works great!
5,Its a good buy,2GB M2 works well with my Sony Ericsson w200a. The price is cheap I felt. And I love my phone for the audio quality. This is a nice way to keep away from separate mp3 player.
4,works in K800i,"it works in the K800i. I have yet to test it with a USB adapter, but used the USB cable. Speed is acceptable although I will say that I have never had a MS product, so it might not be a fair assessment."
5,"Great product, great price! No complaints",This fits my phone perfectly. I've had no trouble with it and I like the price.
4,Works good,The delivery was quicker that the estimated and it works quite well with my Sony Erickson W580.
5,Guitaer wizardry,Tommy Emmanuel is in my opinion a giant amongst giants. This CD is not only technically fantastic but is smooth and silky as well.
5,amazing,"This man plays the music of my soul. Every song is happy, soothing, and pleasent to listen to."
2,Only needs only one listen,"I have listened to Only, only once is all I needed. Only thing is, it is all boring, monatanous, self indulgant, melodically retarded, and unoriginal. It will only take one listen to the incredable Kaki King to realize who will be the future of the acoustic guitar. She was sent to reek havoc on the guitar, and makes Mr. Emmanuel sound like he is sooooo old school.I would only reccomend that you save your money and buy the CDs of Kaki King instead."
5,How could I have missed this guy ?,"Whenever I read reviews, I am made aware we are all different and guitar freaks ( of which I am undoubtedly one ) the world over like different things. Thank God.But I would wager there is not a single ( open minded ) Guitar freak out there who would not sit back and be humbled by the brilliance of this album, nor one that does not find the outstanding beauty and emotion in this music. I have only just received my copy from Amazon, and I dont think since ""Casino"" by Al Di Meola there has been an album that has hit my emotions in the same way.Perfect acoustic guitar playing and( perhaps more importantly ) song writing. Thank you Tommy Emmanuel ... someome below said it ... a masterpiece. Expect more business from me pretty soon !"
5,One of his best,There's reason Tommy Emmanuel is one of only three CGPs--Certified Guitar Players--in the world...and you can hear it on this album. He's a genius.
3,"Long on Text, Short on Pics",I returned the book since I'd been under the impression it was a book of photography; it's not: it's a book *about* photography.
4,Tag sale surprise!,"After fighting through the begining of the book,I found the description of both China and her people fascinating. I felt the author really sought out the true China and the hidden feelings of the Chineese people. I was particularly interested in the decoding of the Chineese laugh. I'm guessing the author didn't get many sincere laughs with all the proding questions he asked. A brother of a friend of mine is embarking on a three year stay in China through his work. I've recomended this book to him and I'm anxious to here his experiences compared to Mr. Theroux."
1,"in the history section, not travel",I read this book before embarking on a five month trip across China. Little in Theroux's book resembles present day China. Plus his personal imprint on what he observes is so annoying that I find little value in recommending this book to anyone except historians.
4,A vivid description of Theroux's travels accross China,"Theroux has been toted as ""the perfect traveller"". Thisbook does nothing but affirm that boastful description. Hedescribes cultural interactions, human observations, andsensory overload in eloquent detail. It is a ""must read""for anyone who is travelling to China."
4,Improves over time,"Slow and non-engaging at the beginning, the pace and tone improve substantially and I was hooked during the last third. This is an account of Theroux's criss-crossing through China during 1988, amazing descriptions of the landscapes surrounding him, and many people's answers to his questions about Mao and the Cultural Revolution. While I probably would have enjoyed it even if I wasn't planning to mimic his trip anytime soon, knowing that I might follow in his footsteps made it all the more exciting. The book would have been better with the first 50 pages cut, largely detailing the annoying habits of a tour group."
2,Theroux imposes his ideals on an unsuspecting population,"Mr. Theroux, instead of giving an openminded glimse into an obviously foreign environment, shows the reader that he is nothing but a ""one trick pony."" While he does give an extensively detailed description of his travels and the people he meets, this is all spoiled by an overwhelmingly negative attitude. Instead of taking the country in, he attempts to impose his personal morals on everyone he meets while traveling through China. At every turn, he needles people about their participation in, and impressions of the Cultural Revolution. While I was glad of the historical information, it had gotten old by the third chapter. In the end, I was given nothing but one big bad impression of China: its trains, officials, hotels, and food. The one thing I am sure of after reading this book, is that the author's ego has clouded his ability to give a fair minded impression of a diverse and fascinating country."
2,if only there were fewer of them,"Something of a disappointing book that took an age to finish and felt more of a chore than a pleasure. Theroux's writing is solid but the character that comes through is an irritable, perfectionist that makes little of those who do not agree with his world view. It's strange that he took the time to learn Chinese and then view them as such dullards. But hey, I've never been to China so perhaps that's how it is.The train rides in themselves do not allow much adventure - more or less a catalog of food eaten and persons who annoy the writer by sharing his cabin.I've liked Theroux's other writings but he felt jaded with his book and I think he did not find the positive in the Chinese character."
2,One long exercise in China-bashing.,"Having read The Great Railway Bazaar and The Old Patagonia Express, I looked forward to Riding the Iron Rooster. And I was greatly disappointed. I felt Theroux went to China expecting to hate it and proved himself right. He was contemptuous of Chinese customs and culture. He looked for things to scorn. His arrogance was displayed on every single page. He was condescending instead of curious. He seemed to want to hold the country to the standards of the United States and was disparaging when rules and regulations dictated something different from what he personally wanted. A major disappointment"
2,"If you want to fall asleep, this should do the trick.","I read into... I don't know, two maybe three chapters of this book. Nothing real exciting. Just a guy on a train and his adventures threw Russia, china and India, the end."
5,Ha! ha! ha! We're screwed!,"First off, let's just accept that this is a great book. Maybe it's about a China that's now gone, but it's a great read nonetheless.For me, well, I once worked with a bunch of Chinese guys, in the US and in Japan. Personally, I think Theroux's observations of ordinary Chinese people are right on the mark. What struck me most was the Chinese laugh. It's true what he says, that the laugh usually means anything but mirth. Sometimes it's to cover embarrassment, sometimes to cover pain, but rarely is it the loud laugh that speaks the vacant mind.Talking to buddies of mine who've traveled in China, mostly by train, and in the last couple of years, I'm struck that not all that much has changed. Maybe for the top 0.25%, but that's about it.Anyway, a good read."
3,Decent look at Fascinating Land,"Author Paul Theroux spent several months traveling through the great Middle Kingdom (China) by train in 1986, as that nation's economic surge was underway and change was starting to affect the land. He details what he found and observed, making a host of political and social observations. He notes that this communist nation was rapidly becoming capitalist (but remaining a police state) under the market reforms of Deng XiaoPing, and the relief many ordinary Chinese felt that the Mao years and Cultural Revolution were gone. He also looks at the rising prosperity, a factor that has surprised more than a few western visitors. Yet reading this book after my own (much shorter) trip to China a decade later, I found his writing style rather stiff, and his adventure not all that adventurist It does have some interesting if somewhat dated mid-1980's observations of China, a nation that has changed significantly over the past quarter century."
5,Great Retro Gaming Controller,If you are looking for a control for retrogaming on the PC look no further. This pad along with a PS 2 to USB controller adapter works great.
4,commentary of Ezekiel,"It is as the title says.It is a commentary of Ezekiel and along with each chapter or portion of commentary there is an application, which makes it very helpful for personal as well as corporate growth."
5,Good value,This set arrived earlier than expected and was in good condition upon arrival. Assembly was easy and the tables look much better than pictured. I will definately buy from this company in the future.
1,bad,i got a broken coffee table an two side table that not in the same side.my recommendation is not to bay this item.
4,Informative and personal,For an historic look at a commercial enterprise that helped to build a province and expand the livelihoods of its people this is a good read. Lots of details that show how the cannery culture rose to prominence and then into decline would make good reading for an economic major or company head. The interviews with the people involved add a personal touch which gives breadth and background to the history.
3,Roberta Flack-Still a classic artist and singer!,"Ok i like this cd but it is unclear where or when this was recorded! No band or singers credits in the weak liner notes. The Closer I get to You is being sung with possibly Andre Smith who has been with her for a while. She still delivers in classic material like, ""Feel Like Makin' Love"", ""Killing Me Softly"", ""Jesse"" (love this song!), ""Some Gospel According to Matthew"", ""Rev Lee"".....Other than that the band is a little ""light"" with no real uumph! She is a female vocalist that has a pure and original sound. At 63yrs old she sounds and plays GREAT! This cd was worth buying, I've been a fan since her 1st recording. Had Donny Hathaway lived I would have LOVED to hear how they would sound together today."
3,Illustrations make the history come alive,"This book absolutely brims over with illustrations, making it an excellent addition to any Druidic shelf. While I disagree with some of Ms. Green's statements (such as saying the Celts were basically illiterate - an argument convincingly disputed by Peter Berresford Ellis, among others) and I am not comfortable with the summation of modern Druids comprising the end (making us all seem cookie cutter similar), I still believe this book should be read. The numerous illustrations I have already mentioned do much to show examples of things or places you may have heard of before, but were previously unable to picture mentally. At the end of the book is an excellent ""travel planner"" if you plan to visit some of the ancient sites associated with ancient Celts and Druids."
2,EXCITING AS A THESIS ON WATCHING PLANTS GROW,"Miranda Green presented a topic in such a way that it would bore the average reader to tears. Too much time is spent on comparing the Roman point of view to what could actually be the case according to Green. There are some highlights worth reading, but overall it is presented in an unexciting format."
2,A Good Book to Put on the Coffee Table,"This was an interesting topic but the author supplied very little information. The pictures are good, though, and it would look nice decorating someone's coffee table. It might also serve for a reference book for a grade schooler's report."
1,Lasted one month,"Apparently this same hose is packaged under several different Weber part numbers for some strange reason. Buy this hose only if you have no squirrels or other rodents where you live. They like the taste (maybe it's grease that drips on it), and bite right through causing a leak. They ruined mine after just 1 month of use. A far better quality product that does the same thing is the Freedom Grill FG-50HA hose. It is stainless steel braid hose, and animal proof. It is slightly shorter, but still plenty long enough to reach from the Q grill at table height to a 20 lb cylinder on the ground. Thanks for earlier reviews that point to the FG-50HA. I bought it and it works great with my Q."
1,Bad brass fittings,"Hello Amazon,I'm a happy Amazon shopper, and was very pleased when I received my product and the hooked it up to my Baby Q. When the weather became very warm about 90 the brass fitting the one end came off. So I had to take it to a hose shop near me and cut off both ends and have new brass pressure fitting installed.They told me that the one install by the company were installed incorrectly, it can now stand the heat."
5,Exactly What It Says,"This hose lets you use a large propane tank instead of the small canisters on a Q100 grill. It works and seems to be quality made. It was simple to install and has given me no problems in the past 2 years. Since nothing is perfect, here's the downside. The hose is 6 feet long. You don't need a 6 foot hose. For a Q series sitting on a cart you need about 30 inches. I've had to coil mine into a couple of loops to take up the slack."
2,Credulity Incredible,"The Mission Song starts gamely enough, with an interesting cast of characters and a juicy conspiracy. But once the lead character, Salvo, begins to question the motives of his employers, the novel spirals rapidly into a series of increasingly implausible attempts to set things right. At least justice is served when Salvo ends up a secret prisoner with plenty of time to reflect on his stupidity.Le Carre has long been a master of the clever thriller. This one devalues the brand."
3,Interesting,"I enjoyed the book. It keeps your interest and Salvo, the protagonist is likeable. The book itself appears to be a product of the author's sympathy for the Congo and its history, but he is clearly no historian and story line appears to me simply a vehicle for the author to express his own simplistic solutions."
2,"Wow, what a gong show","I wanted to stop reading this book halfway through. I thought the writing was verbose and uneccesarily convoluted. I often had to repeat paragraphs. I thought the characters weren't developed well enough. The plot was very boring in the middle of the book, the island meeting dragged on and on. I also thought the love affair between Hannah and Salvo was silly, shallow and vacuous. Okay, so you're both from the same country and all the other male characters want to boink her, but could Le Carre not deepen their attraction any further? At times I felt the book was absurd. I'm a big fan of Le Carre's previous novels...this one was a huge disappointment and not how I want to remember Le Carre."
2,the mission song,The voice is low and hard to hear. For seniors that doesnt work very well/ the book was fantasic would suggest the book form instead
4,Solid effort,"After the end of the Cold War le Carre became interested in the local conflicts, much smaller in scope in comparison with the East-West standoff, and most of them virtually unknown to general public in the West. Some of the resulting books are rather forgettable (like ""Our game""), but some are of a higher quality, like the Mission Song. It's hard for me to judge the historical correctness of the conflict description in the novel, because I do not know anything about Eastern Congo. Probably many people will disagree with a lot of descriptions there (I suspect Rwandans will be among those). However, because of this book, at the very least, I became interested in the subject, and I want to learn more about this amazing piece of Africa - amazingly rich and unbelievably poor at the same time.This book is not perfect, but it's a must read for le Carre fans and those who care about sub-Saharan Africa."
2,A disappointing spin. .,"A disappointing spin. His gift is in describing the intermost relationships bewteen individuals envolved in a very stressful relationship. These were all unreal people in an unreal situation. Thus, leaving the author with no way to display what he does best. Compare this story with his ""Our Game"" in which he, the author, is superlative"
2,Skip It,"I never thought I would feel this way about a John LeCarre book, but when I had finished The Mission Song I was sorry I had read it. I have loved his books ever since Spy Who Came in from the Cold and no one ever wrote better or more substantial fiction about the cold war and its real effects on the people involved than he did. But despite having had some success with other titles since the end of the cold war, the Mission Song was a bore. I didn't really care or understand what I was supposed to get from the main character other than the general sense of how the west has screwed the African continent and continues to do so even under the guise of providing relief. The story is flat, the characters uninvolving and in general not worth reading. It's such a shame, but even the great ones don't always hit a homerun in each at bat so we give them some slack and move on."
2,Same old same old,John Le Carre needs to find a new voice. This is the same old reprisal of the usual themes in all his post cold war books - young idealists battling greedy corporations bent on profits above human life and decency.It was amusing in the first book - but this is the fourth or fifth book on the same theme. Find something else Mr Le Carre.The writing is cliched.
2,A continuing sad decline,"I have marveled for years at Le Carre's skills, but, as other reviewers have noted, his post-Cold War novels have necessarily changed from the George Smiley books that originally hooked me. The characters have become more predictable (Salvo especially) and, as le Carre has become more overtly political in his writing, he has lost the ability to surprise the reader. His worldview predestines the course of the story, and within a few pages the reader can pretty much predict the direction of the tale, if not the actual ending. That's a sad departure from the early novels, when, without ever resorting to cheap plot twists, le Carre would effortlessly turn the plot on its head in a single phrase, leading the reader on a relentlessly fascinating and utterly unpredictable wild ride. There are still glimmers of the master's brilliance in this work, but the fun is gone."
1,Sub-Par and Almost Unreadable,"I have been a big fan of LeCarre novels, and I usually purchase his books as soon as they come out, without bothering to read any reviews. Recently though, I have been gravely disappointed.The Mission Song is a sad departure from his clever and dynamic mystery and spy novels. The characters are bland and uninteresting, the plot is quite obvious, and the lengthy passages describing articles of clothing and surroundings are extremely boring. When certain characters go into page upon page of lengthy political diatribes, you get the sense that you are watching an oratory by a self-serving United Nations or White House demagogue on C-SPAN.Let's not forget the ridiculous, sub-par, love novella sub-plot that should have no place in a thriller by such a high caliber author. Who are we kidding?To sum it up - I've painstakingly labored through half of the book, and am considering throwing it out the window unfinished."
2,The Mission Song,The main character is weak. This is not up to the standard that Le Carre has set for himself.
4,Thought provoking.,It gave me a better insight into the problems that the third world countries face continuously.
3,Slow start-good finish,"A first-person telling of intrigue re originating a coup in Eastern Congo--has some chilling realism of how/who could be behind some actual historic happenings in the area. Without revealing who the bad guys are, I was surprised at the naivete of the principal. Not the best of Lecarre's efforts, but a believeable account of how the Congo's troubles may be caused."
2,The worst le Carre novel I have read,"My title says it all. I am a big fan of this author, but I was VERY disappointed in this book.I could not recommend it to anyone."
3,Good story but....,"John le Carre is one of my favorite authors bar none but, although this is a good story, I thought it took too long to get going. And once it got going, it slowed down again and again. I thought this book had way too many slow parts. Maybe Le Carre was unsure which path the plot should follow because he had too many ideas in his head or had too many characters which he had to take the time to develop that the plot had to meander along so he could find the time to encompass them all. I can't be sure. Plus, the ending had me wanting more. It just seemed like the ending was too easy...I don't know. Maybe I was just hoping for a more happy one. But, in the real world, espcially in the spy business, more often then not we don't get one. Which is how it should be. Nevertheless, I wanted more."
4,Le Carre strikes again,"So many fans of John Le Carre feared that an unwelcome bi-product of the demise of the cold world would be the demise of le Carre. Definitely not so. Again Le Carre has proven his mettle. Less enigmatic that his cold war works, this is still a most enjoyable read. We see a side of modern espionage and power plays that is unique- it is from an interested professional interpreter's point of view. We are treated once again to a master wordsmith, undiminished by age or circumstance. There are the customary twists and turns within the plot. Surprises abound. Duplicity reigns. At the end, one awaits the next piece by Le Carre, wondering what new invention he will create."
3,Too Loud,"I have had chocolate fountains before and I thought that this one would be great, two in one!I just got it and the first thing that I noticed was how loud it is! I brought it to work for a fun staff day and turned it on and it could be heard throughout the building. I cannot imagine what it would sound like at a party or a wedding reception.Seems to work well so far but the noise is annoying. I do wish it was a bit warmer too. It heats up in one section and the chocolate is not circulating as well as I would like. The plastic ""dippers"" are about the size of toothpicks, a little hard to dip without getting it all over."
2,"good idea, but bad quality","This was a good idea for a party, but I was not impressed at all by the quality of the product. We tried it out a few days before the party to make sure that it worked. It worked, but the motor was so loud. We added more chocolate to see if the sound was dependent on how full the basin was, but that didn't fix the issue. Also, when we put both white and dark chocolate in their separate basins, the white chocolate started turning tan -- we found out that the divider separating the two basins was not completely welded/sealed down that the two different chocolates were mixing. One good note about this - our guests still enjoyed the chocolate fountain (I think becasue of its novelty)."
3,blondie,Worked great for a while at my daughtes wedding then one side started to clump up and not work. Was very disappointed!! Havent used it since.
1,double chocolate fountain,product did not work....sounded like someone grinding gears on a manual transmission! Very disappointing when it was supposed to be my centerpiece for my 25th anniversary celebration.
1,Very Disappointed,"We bought this for a Halloween party but the night of the party, after we had already bought all the dipping food, the fountain did NOT work. I had to run to Bed, Bath and Beyond to pick up another one as people were starting to arrive at the party. I was late for my own party...very stressful. We are returning the product for a full refund.Marsha Sloan"
2,Overrated..,"While they do a decent job when they're new, In a matter of about an hour I managed to completely destroy the left guard. I ride flatland bmx, and broke my hand twice this year, so as a precaution I bought a pair of these and as I said.. They do a great job of protecting your wrist when they're new. The plastic skids, and reinforcements are in great positions, they're comfortable to wear, but the vinyl/cloth/neoprene or whatever is very poorly constructed and will not last. Now again I'm a flatlander not a skater or regular bmx'er, so my hands/feet see more wear than anything, but they still will not last very long, fortunately they're fairly cheap to replace.(cause you'll be doing that often)"
1,avoid,"These are no good. The plastic inserts are flimsy and weak. I could feel it even when brand new - I didn't have to wait to break my wrist like some other reviewers to know these things are lame-o. Unfortunately I bought them in a set, and can't return because I wore the rest of the set fine. These guys need a slap."
3,Happy bit not impressed,These wrist guards are great for the kids... They are hard to get on and a little uncomfortable. But they do protect the wrists when falling. Which is why they were bought! Do the job... Maybe not the most comfortable!
4,Helps with the RICA Case Study...,This book is pretty good with becoming an effective literacy teacher. Many of the different strategies given are good to know for your own classroom. This book was helpful because I used it in conjunction with other materials to study for the RICA and I passed. This version is just as good with the newest edition. I didn't miss out not having the newest edition...
1,Nothing beyond the obvious for remedies,"The advice given is along the lines of ""a nervous rider should ride a calm horse"". Well, yeah. The chapter section titled ""Drugs and Tranquillisers"" in the first paragraph, without mentioning any specifics, argues ""don't use them as they are addictive"". Not helpful, and for intermittent use (such as hauling or teeth floating) not even true."
2,Not what I expected,"A lot about psychology, but little Nervousness about how to deal with it. Dont useful for getting over fear but may help a little in understanding horse behavior."
4,Very Attractive Door Stops,"These are great. They look terrific and stop the doors well. I had to put some no-slip carpet underlining under one of them to keep it from sliding. It needs to be a couple of inches out from the wall because of a robe hook on the door. If they had come with non slide undersides, I would have rated them 5 stars."
5,"Don't Die With Your Music In You""","Because of the wisdom in ""This is Your Life, Not a Dress Rehearsal"" fewer people will die with their music still in them. In this life, God created all of us equally. He gave each one of us a basket of talents. Some of us begin early digging into our baskets. Others, like Grandma Moses, don't begin digging until they are in the sunset of their lives. Donovan invites you to dig now. His ideas work because he takes ""grow where you're planted"" to an energized new level, teaching people how to have the courage to realize their biggest dreams and truly live their version of the good life. Use Jim's book to help you realize every dream you've ever dared to dream and more. Give Jim's book to every brilliant underachiever you know and you'll make the world a better place with your efforts!"
3,Shared this with a friend,I did find some uplifting and motivating thoughts in this book and did share it with a friend. Not a bad read.
2,Predictable...,"Nothing in this book you have not read before: perseverance, commitment, making mistakes. You already know this if you are living in the real world. I did not finish it, because I already knew the ending...!"
2,Predictable Philosophy,"The book is okay, but not really anything new and earth shattering. I couldn't finish the book, but it's well written. Maybe I was just expecting more from the title."
2,wet mail,"Received quickly - looks great on post and do like how the door works, but after being on post for 2 weeks - came home to wet mail last night after a rainy day...."
3,"Worth it, for 3 songs, alone","I bought this cd, because I was searching for Mndolay, by LaFlavour. I picked this cd, over others, because it walso had 2 other great classics from the late 70s/early 80s : Burn Rubber, and There but for the Grace of God. The rest, are not as good as those 3, but not terrible either. I generally only listen to it, Until Burn Rubber, and then skip the rest."
4,Great,I think the product is great except it lost a star because the black print is too light. It could be darker.
3,Original and Witty Screenwriting,"When I saw ""A Life Less Ordinary"", I thought it was one of the best films that I had seen. I got the screenplay for a Christmas gift and sat down to read it. I was dissapointed when I first read it, because it didn't feel much like the movie. But, I later re-read it and realized that this is screenwriting at it's best. Hollywood screenwriters should take note of Scottish screenwriter John Hodge. He's crafted a brilliant script out of a difficult to make high-concept. The story is funny, action-packed, a little sad, has original, natural, and hilarious dialogue and, near the happy ending, a nice little romance. The story is great, and Hodge and his collaborators, director Danny Boyle and producer Andrew MacDonald, should consider doing more high-concept films which twist old formulas."
1,Not Basenji Specific,"Look, if you're looking for Basenji specific books, this is not one of them. It is informative, but not on Basenjis. This book would work for any breed rescue. I was disappointed because what I wanted was a book with all the pluses and minuses of living with a Basenji. This book contained none of that information. What it did have was great tips on rescuing and living with a rescued dog. The only thing ""Basenji"" about it was the title and the photos."
2,File under Children's Books,"I was quite excited to read this book since I brought a young Basenji home from the pound last week, but if you consider yourself an intelligent individual capable of critical reasoning, I suggest you look for training guidance elsewhere. The authors dumb down the content to such an extreme that they include ""Basenji"" in the list of things you will need to teach your dog to sit. Come on! I read this sad 'how-to' in an hour....."
1,I think this is a women's watch,"This is way too small for a men's watch, both the face and the band -- the band wouldn't even go around my wrist. I think this must be a women's watch mislabled. Nice looking, but I sure can't use it -- I'm going to have to return it!"
1,Woman's Watch,This is not a man's watch. I used to own the larger version and this is NOT it. It is a great watch if you are looking for something with a smallish band and face.
3,"nice ,but strap to short,and face to small","this is a womans watch,not a mans, and even as a women it is hard to read, and I also have a small wrist but the strap is really short, they need to improve on the case size and make the straps longer for larger wrists. all in all its just ok."
4,Nice watch for the sale price,"I bought this watch a while ago because of the sale price. I wanted an everyday, study watch. I think the design is attractive, and the face is easy to read. Only issue is that the date isn't always accurate; today is the 28th, but the watch shows 27. Obviously there's no allowance for months being 30 or 31 days. However, it's easy enough to set to the correct day."
4,Great Watch - No Replacement Band,"This is a great watch! (Yes, folks, it IS a WOMAN'S WATCH! I says so right here on the website!) I've had it for a couple of years now it's the best watch I've had in ages. However, the leather band is cracked and the tabs that hold the end down have disintegrated and fallen off, so I can't wear it any more. I haven't been able to find a replacement band like the one that comes with the watch anywhere, either on line or in stores. If anybody knows where I can get one, I'd love to know."
2,too small!,"I love Timex and have been wearing them my whole life! This watch, however, disappointed me. It is much too small for a women's watch...The band, the face, everything about it. I returned it and got something else, also by Timex, with which I am much happier."
2,Will never buy a Timex again,"I bought several of these watches because I am a woman who does not want a frilly watch with diamonds around it or a danty watch. This watch was just the right size, not too huge or really tiny, and the look was sporty. I have owned 3 of these now and am disappointed in quality. They genuinely keep good time, but the light that illuminates the time goes within a year of purchase. The band and battery only last a year as well and the band is hard to find to replace. I had a Timex when I was a kid and it lasted years. Quality has gone downhill. This is why I will never buy a Timex again. Spend $50 more and get a good watch."
