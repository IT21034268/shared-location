4,INCREDIBLY GENERIC BUT DAMN GOOD,"These guys are nothing new, are not aggresive, and are not heavy. But theyre awesome i have no idea why. Theryre reminescient of every mxc band i cant hink of but they hold their own with how well they channel what all those other bands have. I saw them at The Loft in Ventura and they have an incredible presence live."
1,Contains homophobic content,"I bought this book for my niece but did not give it to her because I noticed a homophobic insinuation. On page 5 two girls are discussing the gym teacher, Miss Wimberly. One of the girls questions whether or not the teacher is alright or ""sorta strange"". The other girl responds that Miss Wimberly is not strange because she flirts with Mr. Evans on the bus line. What is the author saying here? Does he find gay people ""strange""? I think so. I did not want my niece exposed to this kind of thinking so I returned this book."
2,Not up to Lonely Planet Standards,I am reading this guide in preparation for an upcoming trip to Florence. I have found this guide confusing and badly organized. I still don't have a feel for the major sights in each area. I'm going to have to buy a few other guides. I usually have good luck with Lonely Planet guides - this one just isn't up to snuff.
3,not enough credit!,time passes and people forget. but if you are into the 80s music scene your collection will not be complete without this one. two of the best songs of the 80s wouldnt it be good and the riddle ! timeless classics.
3,"Where the ""Good"" stuff is","Nik Kershaw was an unfortunately typical artist in the video-happy 80's. Tuneful, photogenic and big on synths, he was a cross between George Micheal and Howard Jones. That is epitomized on his biggest international hit, ""Wouldn't It be Good."" The video was typical of the period, wild haircuts, ersatz Bowie posturing and satellite dishes. The album ""Human Racing"" became his biggest hit and he established himself overseas, but is pretty much a one-hit wonder in the US.This collection doesn't do much to dissuade anyone from thinking his lack of star magnitude was unjust. The songs on the collection are pretty run of the mill, with only ""I Won't Let The Sun Go Down on Me"" and ""The Riddle"" (which was the title track to his second album and another pretty cool video) being the most interesting and individualistic songs here. For those three, this collection rates 3 stars. As for the rest, it's a tad on the generic side."
5,A Little Country Girl,"my daughter,got the book and loves it. She loves storys she can relate to and has really is enjoying.one.THANK YOU/"
1,"If you are looking for early classical music collections, this is not the one.","My personal interest is for early classical music and I though at least more than half of the collections would consist of those pieces I love. However, the large portion of this collection is made up of the contemporary or of late 19 century composers.Thus it was not for me, but I still have great admiration for Telarc's effort to make best sounding recordings."
4,It's not perfect but......,"This is my favorite War album. I instantly liked it when it came out back in the 70's. I just acquired the CD and all those ""Driving through the country on a warm sunny day that everything is just working out fine feelings"" rush back just like it was yesterday. I still have the album.Yes, it isn't like the other War albums. And that's OK. War was more than those other albums. The group had a sound that was unique,varied, and popular with social messages that are still true today. My teen age kids like War and this album(Which in itself is rather scary). This album,apparently, doesn't fit well together according to liner notes about it. I disagree. I always thought it flowed rather well. I always found comfort in the flow from ""H2O Overture"" to ""In your Eyes"" to ""Me and Baby Brother"" to ""Southern Part of Texas"". Sort of like a building wave that ends with just the right peak. Another classic album that transcends eras."
1,don't waste your money,"I bought the Jabra BT5010 because it seemed to offer Bluetooth 2.0 at a reasonable price (better than almost all other 2.0 headsets out there). After charging the device up and pairing it with my Blackberry Pearl, I attempted to make three phone calls using the headset. On each of the three phone calls, the person on the other end told me that they could not hear me. I continued to try, but each time they told me that they could only hear parts of what I was saying. Buy another headset."
4,Jabra BT5010 Bluetooth Headset,"I bought this BT headset, it is working good so far and I am please with its performance."
2,"Impossible to wear, poor battery life","I've had it for about two months and have actually been able to use it once. Most of the time I get it out to use it and the battery is dead. Shelf life, even fully charged and off, seems to be a matter of days. When by some miracle there's some juice in the battery, I am consistently unable to get it to fit over my ear in such a way that the microphone is somewhat close to my cheek. Usually the thing barely dangles off my ear and projects out into space with the mike boom several inches away from my face. Five minutes of adjustment may or may not get it to some acceptable placement, but by then I'm ready to stomp on it instead of use it."
2,poor signal,pros:- connect well to pocket pc and laptop for hearing mp3 audio.cons:most of the time people cannot hear me(mainly while driving).I do not recommend this product.
3,"Sound okay; but the original ""hello"" gets beeped out","Thus far everyone hears me okay; and if I got extra earbuds, I could probably hear better. But when I call out, it makes a beeping noise when the other end is picking up, erasing the first ""hello"" on the other end leaving me a questioning ""Hello?"" Receiving calls with the headset is a pain, half the time it doesn't pick up. I love the design of this, but I'm going to have to get a different headset."
3,"Unit is Okay, Seller TigerDirect has not so great return policies","I received this unit about two months back. The sound quality is average at best.The seller (TigerDirect) has a return policy that you have to get a 'defective unit' certification from manufacturer before you can return it, so, basically, if the unit is of bad quality (by design), you are stuck with it. So, I do not think I will again buy from TigerDirect, although I will buy from Amazon (directly)."
4,cool,This game rocks it has great graphics and the glass sound makes it sound real we dont need no practice on that game if you new how to play it you wouldn't have such a problem.
2,Ford Racing could have been a good game,"This game could be playable, if you had more choices., for example: if you had a chance to practice on a given track, thereby giving you a better chance of Racing on that track, Particularly at night. Leave the sound of broken glass, sort of ridiculas. This game could be playable, if it was made on the same basis as Viper Racing. I hope you get the message: You should have the choice to race during the day, or night:"
5,One of the most inaccessible capitals in the world,"Maps and beautiful color photographs enhance the informative text of Pyongyang: The Hidden History Of The North Korean Capital by Chris Springer. Pyongyang showcases a series of site-by-site descriptions of one of the most inaccessible capitals in the world. Well researched commentary provides truthful insights behind official history and propaganda, ranging from the Korean War down to the present day. A informational prize for armchair travelers, and a highly recommended introductory familiarization guide for anyone journeying to North Korea, Pyongyang is an enthusiastically recommended addition to personal and community library collections."
2,The Hidden Disappoinment,"If you can find some way for someone else besides you to pay for this book, and you are a Korean studies amateur who is still in the process of creating a knowledge base about the DPRK and the mythology of Pyongyang in particular, then this book is for you. Otherwise, thirty dollars is a ridiculuous price for this 150 page wanna-be Lonely Planet guide to Pyongyang. A simple Google search will net you better pictures and better info on the city itself, particularly if you can read Korean, and if you are really interested in specific aspects of the city then you need a newsgroup or a direct Email to an expert. I was very disappointed when I received this book in the mail - professional or skilled amateur DPRK watchers beware; first timers who found 30 bucks on the street this morning by accident, get some. Nan - bagaji seot da."
5,Nice kit!,"Well, just as described, and as most of the other reviews, this kit arrived and is totally awesome! It's easy to follow and get started. I should be eating some sprouts in a few days that I grew, instead of bought! Oh, make sure you have some empty cabinet space to store all the packs of seeds, there is a bunch!"
4,Love my sprouts...,"Excellent product, easy to use, and recommend to anyone who enjoys the greener things in life."
5,Great way to get my feet wet!!,"I've messed around with a bit of UNIX at work as a shell account user, but with this economy, it never hurts to know more tech and be a little less dispensable, so I wanted to set up my own system at home and get my hands dirty.This book has been a miracle, helping me get through everything from setting up the basics on an old computer I had sitting in the garage (nice to get more use out of it) to implementing a GUI, setting up server daemons, even doing some troubleshooting.I think I'd have had a slower start if I hadn't already had some basic UNIX experience (navigating, copying files, using a non-GUI text editor) but beyond that, I thought this book was really useful and quite helpful. It's going to be on my reference shelf for a while."
4,good for a beginner,"I think this book accomplishes exactly what the title mentions, ""A Beginner's Guide"". I guess I thought myself as in the ""beginner"" category, but after reading this book, I realized that I was not and needed something with a bit more depth to help me. But in any case, it was a good read."
5,life changing book,"I wish that everyone in America, no, in the world, could or would read this book. I imagine what a different world would be born out of the consciousness and the compassion that this book brings to light. It has helped me to become aware of how little I have ever been allowed to experience or express my authentic responses in life. This knowledge, of course, then suddenly opens up the doors for the feelings I have banished all of my life. If you care about children, if you care about humanity, if you care about yourself, read this book. I believe that the ideas contained within it offer hope for the understanding and transformation of so much suffering that is present in our world. If you are able to take in its content, it will change your awareness. This book is well worth every dime and minute that I spent on it. One of the most important books I have read, and I read A LOT."
3,It came without drivers,the printer is working fine once i got it installed it did not come with drivers and we had some issues getting it up and running with the universal HP Driver..
1,Do not use this product!!!!!,I tryed this product hoping to build nice heavy finish in less time on some wood working projects. Two weeks later it still has not fully cured. I applied two coat 24 hours apart as instructed. It drys on the surface but underneath it remains tacky. Making it impossible to continue with the project and impossible remove and start over.
1,Badge of Dishonor is a joke,"I know both authors, worked with Darlene Catalan, and I am part of the ""book"" that she wrote. My name is not mentioned correctly in the book (as are many of her other characters - my coworkers) because the stories are not true. This is a scorned woman who was known to be a little off of her rocker and who sued the government entity of which she wrote for almost a decade, unsuccessfully I might add, because the accusations were all crap. I too am a woman in federal law enforcement and, as it is not an easy existance and takes balls of another sort to survive, I assure you it is worth every minute. Catalan never understood this. Instead, she chose to blame everyone else for her difficulties, whether real or imagined, like a child who never truly matures."
1,never know what you will get :(,"""Product DescriptionTDK DVD-R 4X in 25-Pack Spindle. Rewritable, high-storage disks. ""1) What the heck! these are NOT ""rewritable.""2) first batch I got were TY (Great!) second batch I got were made by ""coaster maker city"" CMC (very bad). If TDK wants to keep any customers they should be careful in such wide swings with manufacturers and quality."
2,suckss,Wow what can i say bout this game first off the graphics are pretty horrible. They made this game saying there gana be returning to the old tony hawk ways but totally tankd on it. Id rather go back to my ps2 and play the original tony hawk pro skater games. The graphics were about the same anyways. And the array of skaters sucks. I mean i love bam margera but hes not much of a skater. Wheres erik koston for god sake!!!
2,"DId not enjoy this, maybe next one","I bought this expecting this would be nice as the old skate games like I was used to play on earlier with PSone. But it was disappointing. I thought some reviews I saw were so hard hard on their reviewing comments and it should not be that bad but honestly, now I agree.To play carrier mode is ok but to play multiplayer mode it is not even ok, the screen sharing is too bad and even if you're used to play another multiplayer games you should feel a little difficulty to get used with this on this game. Anyways, I do not recommend if you are looking for some multiplayer game. If you're looking for a single/carrier skate game, it should be ok."
2,cheats don't work on PS3,"...basically the same style of game as other Tony Hawk games (and I've owned three other ones on Xbox). You can't use the cheat codes on PS3, though. There are some codes out there, but they only work on other systems. To me, it takes a lot of the fun out of the game not to be able to grind or manual indefinitely. No bails was a good cheat, too.One new fun aspect to this game, though, is the ability to intentionally bail and bounce around racking up significant hospital bills. There are even some challenges where you must bail and knock over bowling pins or such."
4,great skatboard game,i like tke this game allot ill rather play this game than SKATE....the challenges are better and funer...
2,Project 8 major disappointment.,This game is confusing and harder to figure out than the other toney hawk games. I would recomend just playing the old ones. Out with the new in with the old.
3,It's a decent slingshot.,"Not the best power, but pretty good for it's price. Don't buy ammo, just shoot rocks out of it.If you are a good shot, you can dispose of backyard bird pests if you make headshots. Not recommended though."
2,Didn't last long,"The elastic firing band broke after very little use, maybe 30-40 shots at most. Yes, it didn't cost much, but it should have lasted longer than this."
1,Save yourself the money and just buy a good knife!,"Plain and simple - this tool does NOT work. At all.It is supposed to mince the herbs when rolled over them on a cutting board. In reality, what it does is smash and juice the herbs into a pulpy mess. It does not work on parsley, chives, oregano, nothing. I tried several herbs, and it did not cut a single stem of any of them. It didn't even ""kinda work"" or work a little - it did not function one bit.My second complaint is how lightweight and flimsy the tool is. For the money, I was expecting something a bit nicer. The tool is actually very light; the blades are thin and cheap. The handle is hollow; the entire thing bends easily.Do not waste the money on this. It flat out does not work."
4,Love it!,"The best part of this game is the fact that you can save it before a battle, and when you get your a-- kicked you can reload and try again."
1,Terible,"The campains are chessy and nothing new is added. This title detracts from the rest of the series and i hope that gathering of storms has what this does not, somthing new!"
5,Best Tasting Cold Prevention!,"Please keep this company in business. They make the best tasting and amazingly effective cold prevention product out there. I used to be able to buy it at Publix, but now I can only get it online. Give it a try you will be the next one leaving a review like mine.Mom of 2 in Florida."
5,Awesome Product!,"I have used NTFC for a couple of years now, AND, I have not had a cold for a couple of years! At the first sign of a cold coming on or being around someone with a cold, I pop of these and they do the trick! I was quite disappointed that my local Walgreens quit carrying them. I am happy to have found them here online and intend to stock up!!"
3,Not the Original,"This is a nice little book which would be great for an inexpensive wedding or anniversary gift. It is not, however, the original sermon delivered by Henry Drummond. According to the back page of the book it is in ""today's language,"" but in my opinion it is only roughly so. It in not even a true paraphrase as elements of the original are omitted. So, if you're looking for the original sermon delivered by Henry Drummond -- you need to look elsewhere. There are many books containing the original available elsewhere including eBay and through Amazon.com's used books. I highly recommend the original for the beauty of the language and the great message it contains."
5,Yum!,"Do not sit down and read this book when you are hungry because your mouth will water. Page by page. A deluge of sensuous and practical inspiration for the foodie and novice, this new book by Karen Page and Andrew Dornenburg will make anyone who likes the tactile sensation of cooking feel like you're in the kitchen, surrounded by aromas of some of the world's best cuisines."
1,It's about neither architecture nor movement,"Anyone choosing this book on the basis of the title will be disappointed, since it has nothing to do with architecture and nothing to do with transportation. Instead, this book consists of 22 collections of photographs, all of which take unorthodox approaches to photography in urban settings. We have such things as photos of the pattern of pipes on the ceilings of Paris subway stations, an artificial mountain in the Netherlands made of garbage, snapshots someone found laying in the street, fictitious typed letters between a photographer and some imaginary character, street markings that have been spray-painted by municipal workers, and so on. Despite the editor's introductory essay, I'm mystified as to why this book exists."
1,"Bryan, go away!",He is one of the worst things to happen to country music. He is pop; he is NOT country.
5,great; hits the heart,the song i am not supose to love you anymore;it really hit home for me;thanks bryan i feel less alone when i hear that song. knowing i am not the only one who knows how it feels to lose the one they still love...
5,Uplifting CD,"Hi,I have heard Sandy Patti and I find that her voice is too shaky for me. I prefer the voice of Natalie Grant. It is much more crisp and clean. Sandy Patti has a voice that sounds like she needs to clear her throat. Sorry. Listening to her was a waste of time for me. I wish I had gone ahead and purchased this CD first. It is very uplifting and takes me to a different attitude. I suddenly feel great again. Both are great Christian singers, it is your preference. God Bless"
2,Not as good as the last!!,I have the all three of Natalie's CDs. This is by far not as inspiring as the others. She has a great voice but is mis directed in chosing songs. I fell in love with her voice on her first cd and had hoped she would be able to sustain that light. This cd seems more worldly than the last two. Like I said she does have a voice and she could be right up there with Sandi Patti if she could get better music.
5,Salvation and Days Like These,"I have read many of the reviews here, and speaking as someone that grew up in the church and walked away I would have to say that Natalie is right on target with this CD, it is hip, not worldly, has a variety of beats and artistic styles. I love many of the songs on this CD and I also have her Stronger CD. I listen to Deeper Life all the time at work. Days Like These gets me pumped in the morning to realize God created this day just for me. The words to the songs really go deep into your mind and cause you to think. I am not alone is so wonderful. And Always be Your baby...well I hope my dad will enjoy that song when I get married. Check it out..."
5,Great artist,My favorite christian singer. Her cd's are wonderful full of God's love and experience. She is even better in person
4,Excellent read-aloud,"This is a very fun and entertaining book, especially for K-2. The only downside was the fact that it is overpriced for a library discard."
4,Robotic Goodness,"This book about (robots doing) different jobs in/around the house plays out like a fun memory/matching game. The repetition of household chores and amazing use of color and shape propel the story. Done digitally, these illustrations should be the basis of a Design 101 class."
2,Wireless Web Development with PHP and WAP,"Not much meat, I think this book was a general waste of time and money"
4,About what I expected.,"Although one of my bowls arrived completely shattered, the others were exactly what I expected to receive. I didn't even mind the shattered one because I only needed four bowls. They are a great size for a one or two-scoop sundae."
1,Arrived broken,These bowls looked gorgeous but they arrived in 100+ pieces. Sadly they were only wrapped in a single layer of bubble wrap in a box without any packaging material.
2,Disappointed twice...,"Very disappointed with this item's arrival. We ordered them as a birthday gift for a friend, and the first set arrived with a broken one. We asked for another set of 6 to be sent and the next order had 2 arrive broken. We had given packaging feedback and didn't see any change with the 2nd delivery. We asked for a 3rd set to be sent but haven't heard back still from Amazon as to a refund or another shipment. We really like the product, but are disappointed that the friend still doesn't have a complete set of 6 for her family of 6."
2,"Item arrived broken, TWICE","I ordered the bowls along with some other items as part of a wedding gift. The box was inadequately packaged and the bowls were broken on arrival. Having a replacement order shipped was free and easy, but the second shipment of bowls was also inadequately packaged and broken -- very frustrating!! From the two orders, I salvaged enough bowls to complete the gift, but with some delay. The bowls are great if you can get them in one piece."
2,bormioli rocco alaska dessert bowls,"The glasses were exactly as pictured, but they arrived with 3 broken glasses. Rather than go through the hassle of sending them back, I just decided to keep the unbroken ones."
5,Love These Dishes!,"I bought 2 sets (3 dishes per set) while living in Germany. They are perfect for ice cream, fruit, pudding, or cobbler. They are good quality dessert dishes that look great. I highly recommend Bormioli Rocco Alaska Italian dessert dishes."
5,Absolutely beautiful,Just what I was looking for in a dessert dish! Not too big and not too small and stunning to look at.
5,LOVE !,"Absolutely in love with this product. Looks way better in person than on the picture here. Very cute, perfect size! I have had the bigger desert bowls that look very modern purchased at BBB but out of 2 packages i only have 1 left. They were easily breakable, that was with adult usage only. Bormioli look and feel very sturdy. Now that my kids are getting older they will use them and I am sure they will last. I ordered two packages total of 12... thinking of getting one more because it will be perfect for serving deserts at the parties! Love the thick construction, I already droped one twice in the sink and it did not break!. They are adorable. I would recommend to my best friend! All moms.. and everybody out there looking to make their deserts taste better!"
1,Disappointing,"I visit England frequently. I have an earlier edition of this book which I find to be very useful, even now. The new version leaves out a lot of the good places that were in the old book and it lacks credibility. I have a hard time taking any of it seriously when it tells me that an English pint is 16 ounces. Anyone who is serious about English beer knows that an English pint is 20 ounces."
2,travel in england,Not the most interesting or comprehensive text. When cross referenced with other England travel texts this one lacks a great deal.
2,Poor Bulldog Technical Service,"Extremely poor technical support. I have contacted bulldog several times via phone and left messages. If you call the wait time is extremely long and you can leave a voice message with your phone number and they will call you back, right??? I have sent multiple e-mails, received back nothing. If you expect support troubleshooting any issues this is not the product to buy. Packaging was very damaged as well."
1,This should be called the 1200n,"The reason this should be called the 1200n is because the ""e"" in 1200e stands for ""extended range"". I say 1200n for ""no range"". I've seen more range on a 400 lb linemen! When you're standing right next to the vehicle it works fine but thats not the idea now is it? The installation was very easy. I have been certified as an MECP so putting it in was no problem. Making it work is another thing. I've tried everything under the sun to make this unit work. I've tried several antenna solutions and nothing works well. So, when it says extended range don't you believe it!"
5,Works like a charm in my BMW,Added this to my last oil change in my e90 BMW. I noticed things settle down a little at idle which was nice. It's super thick and make sure to measure it out.
5,A Wonderful Book,"Dating : A Singles Guide to a Fun, Flirtatious and Possibly Meaningful Social Life is a terrific book. It's an easy read - a well written book, in a simple style....to the point. The author's approach is funny, lighthearted, and VERY PRACTICAL. Even if you decide some of the suggestions/advice are not for you, the overall information is highly usable. An enthusiastic two thumbs up."
2,Simpsons' Soundtrack in Limited Ed. Packaging.,"I bought this for a Simpsons fan, who since seeing the movie, had been obsessed by the spider pig song. Given the cute packaging, I thought it worth 'importing' this item to Australia and I had high expectations. Unfortunately the packaging was not as cute as I thought it would be. It is cheap looking and doesnt have the characteristics you would expect of a replica donut. The music is not good with the only thing worth putting on the i-pod is the spider pig songs. Maybe next time I will download and not only save the environment but postage money too."
2,nothing too spectacular,"the ""donut"" is quite cheaply made and the little round part in the center that holds the CD in place seems quite brittle. The music was okay...just okay."
4,Don't Diss the Case!,"About the case: Actually, I think the case is priceless. My two halves stay together quite well and it does have a center spindle to held the CD tight. The donut box it comes in is also pretty neat. It was more than I expected really!About the content: it's what I remember in the film! I wasn't really expecting to have Green Day's bits from the film on this. All they could have added perhaps would have been some clips/vocal bits: might have been nice to 'set up' the pieces on this CD. For more of that, we'll all have to wait until the movie is out on DVD, but we'll probably all buy that too...For example they could have had Homer singing 'Spider Pig' and then the orchestral version. That would have been even better...Maybe they've have to pay the vocal artists extra?I LIKE IT! Could have been a little better, but I'd buy it again"
4,"Sigh.....it's a freakin' novelty, what do you expect?","Obviously you're not going to please everyone. Who cares if the donut looks cheap, or looks like something you'd buy at a 99 cent store. Don't buy it then. I borrowed this from a friend who had it, not my cup of tea, it's worth a listen or two, that's it, no biggie. It's not like your favorite band just released a new album, it's simply.....a soundtrack to a kicka** movie."
1,Is only a donut...,"Is only a donut with odor... just that! The 'soundtrack' is all instrumental and very very very boooring... so sorry Simpsons, that's depriment."
1,Disappointment,"I was fairly disappointed on receiving this item because I felt misled. I believed I was getting ""The Simpson's Movie"" as was stated in the headline of the product description, but what I received was a doughnut with a soundtrack inside. While the packaging was better than a conventional cd case, I opted to return it, because it was most certainly not worth $25."
1,"""The Simpsons Movie - Donut Packaging""",Don't be fooled by the title - this IS NOT the movie - it is the music cd. How disappointing for my son on Christmas day when he (I) thought he was getting the movie and it turned out to be a music cd.
3,Uh...where's the funny?,"With song titles like, ""His Big Fat Butt Could Shield Us All"" & ""Thank You Boob Lady"", I expected this to be another funny, witty, Simpsons album like Songs in the Key of Springfield. It's packed in a donut box for crying out loud! I bought this note unheard, sight unseen, without seeing the movie first, because I have really enjoyed prior Simpsons albums. But I hate to say here that I am disappointed. This is an actual movie score, as in classical music. If there is any humor here at all (besides the song titles) it is in the language of music."
3,"Be VERY clear here, THIS IS NOT A MOVIE; it's the soundtrack !!!!","The case is cute and functional; the soundtrack is ""fair to middling""; w/ glimpses of brilliance. But I prefer the movie to just the soundtrack and for less $$$ (and no doughnut) you get both..... I own both just the same. I know the doughnut can only increase in value; because it nevers gets stale. Tee Hee, D'oh !!!!"
4,"Good package, excellent music, but....","The presentation of the cd mantains the essence of the animatd movie, and I think is a great presentation of the excellent music composed by Hans Zimmer. The only problem(and that's the reason of the 4 stars), it's that lacks a lot of music, for instance the Springfield's anthem heard at the credits of the movies don't comes in this CD, I tought that because this cd was a special edition the songs of the credits will apper and just only Spider pig (chorus version, not Homer)comes in the CD, is a good CD but for the price we deserved all the music heard in the movie. A truly special item for hardcore fans."
5,Good and Fast,"Perfect condition. It is what I expected, but the shipping was faster than what I thought. Great service"
1,Don't Buy,"The picture above shown doesn't really show how the donut has no hole in the middle. Also the donut casing looks terrible. The paint job is very poor. The CD itself doesn't fit well inside of the casing too. Overall this product is a huge ripoff. If you want Spider-Pig that bad however, just download it on itunes. Also the song Recklessly Impulsive is a great techno dance beat on the cd. Yet, two songs on a cd doesn't make it worth while for me. It's a waste of money."
3,Donut is great!,"I on the other hand bought it not knowing there was a donut and was excited to find it! The music is good classical soundtrack type music, BUT! It doesn't have any dialogue snippets or Homer singing spider pig, which is why I bought it in the first place!"
4,Read reviews from the other soundtrack page first,"I do not agree with the previous reviewer. The music should be enjoyed either on its own merit, or in the context of the movie. Without having seen the movie, you cannot make a judgment of the musical score as such. Read reviews from the other product page."
5,One of the best American novels ever!,"I was a bookseller in the audience the night Cathie Pelletier picked up her award in Boston for this book, the New England Book Sellers Award. And never has one been more deserved. This has got to be one of the best novels of American life and progress and folklore ever put in print. What a shame future readers will have to search to find it unless it's put back in print. OPRAH, where are you on this one?"
3,Better than not taking a guide.,When I went on my overland trip to South America I took this one and Lonely Planets. I have to be honest and say that both guides complemented each other but I used Lonely Planets guide more often. I guess it would be a matter of preference.
4,Easy reading about encounters with Falang and locals in Laos,"What I really liked about this book was Brett Dakin's ability to write what he saw as he saw it without adding a ponderous analysis, and maintaining his perspective as a wide eyed foreigner learning and listening rather than trying to pass himself as an expert which is a temptation for any author.I read it at the start of my trip to Laos and, apart from several hours of enjoyable reading, it offered me insights into the Lao which helped me with my own interactions with the locals and gave me a better idea of how I was perceived by the Lao.I recommend it for anyone wanting to get a feel for Laos."
3,He was a pretty quiet American,"I wanted to read this book because I have a real interest in Laos. I have been there once and was doing a lot of reading because I was getting ready to return.I learnt a lot about the corruption within the leadership and life for the expat community, but not a lot about life for for the wider community and certainly not life outside Vientienne.If you want to learn more about Laos, it's history and life for the different communities, read Collin Cotterill and his Dr Siri books. They are fiction and they're very entertaining"
2,What a wimp!,"My wife is Lao. We plan to move back to Vientiane in a few months to live. I am counting the minutes.If all I knew about the place was what I had read from this book, I would never go there. Dakin is a complainer who compares life in Lao to the US without realizing that it is not comparable. He turns down a Lao woman who wants a relationship with him? What a loser!Lao PDR is a great country with friendly people, excellent food, Beer Lao, beautiful women, perfect weather, big fish and a government that is easier to live with than the one we have in the US. I look forward to moving there and not returning.Take a day trip from Nong Khai and see for yourself. Lao coffee alone is worth the ride across the bridge."
5,Black Love For The Black Heart,"Black Love is the best album Afghan Whigs ever released. Ok, some diehard fans would say that its Gentleman, but then again, Black love possesed more funk, rock, R&B than any other album, and for me, thats what sets Afghan Whigs from the rest of the 90's music scene. This is one of the few albums that i could listen to day in and day out, and every track is simply brilliant. the guitar work, drums,..everything is just perfect. Greg Dulli makes a masterpiece out of sex, lust, depression, fear, and self loathing and is just purely emotional, and his voice just amplifies it and sure enough, youll hear the voice of a black man in a white boys' body. Greg Dulli got soul."
5,Buy it now!!!,"""Gentlemen"" gets the lip service, but I prefer ""Black Love"".. hell, buy 'em both, you're not going to find much better..."
5,ONE OF THE GREATEST RECORDS OF ALL TIME!,"This is a sadly underated cd--it is hands down one of the best rock records of the 90's--if not ever! Full of passion, it just flat rocks like nobodys business. Could there ever be a better song about revenge than ""My Enemy"" or ""Honkeys Ladder""? Or the funkinesss of ""Going to Town or ""Blame Etc""? This record is without peer. Listen to ""Faded"" and if your not moved---somethings wrong. BUY IT! Its been in my cd player since its release, and isnt going anywhere soon."
2,Only for Historian,"Talked very little about the planes themselves and their development respectively. Instead it focus on the history of the company. Make thing even worse, the company history part repeats on both section (B747 and 777) which makes the tape extremely boring."
4,"Not perfect, but interesting video.","Pretty interesting! If you're a plane enthusiast, this is not a bad DVD. It provides a quick history of the Boeing company (which for some reason, is repeated in both 747 and 777 sections- why?) and goes on to describe the more modern jetliners. It's not a perfect presentation, and some of the footage is re-used (seen more than once), but there are several good moments & intersting info throughout. A decent, cheap DVD for people who like planes...I just wish there had been more time & detail spent on the modern versions of the jets."
5,Why complain about this DVD?,"This DVD is great! I have it, and it talks about the two giants, the 747, and 777, and it talks about aviation as well (I like aviation, so nothing to worry about). Congrats on a good (not the best, but still great) DVD!"
5,An Unexpected Delight,"I won't summarize this novel since others have done a very good job of doing so. What I will say is that I enjoy Durgin's work and expected to like this one as well. What I didn't expect was a thoroughly captivating tale that completely immersed me in the journey undertaken. Unlike some who found issue with the dialect, to me it was one of the facets that brought this tale to life. These people felt real to me in a way that fantasy characters seldom do.If you are looking for something to read that will alternately enrage you, make you cry, and experience intense joy, then Seer's Blood is the book for you."
1,Better luck next time...,"I've read other books by this author, and this is far from her best effort. I couldn't ever really get involved with the characters. They just weren't interesting enough to make me care one way or the other. A better introduction to Ms. Durgin's work is ""A Feral Darkness""."
2,Pulpy and shallow,"While some of the ideas in Durgin's novel are intriguing, she doesn't explore any of them fully. Neither her characters or the plot are all that involving. The novel needed more pages!The book isn't bad -- it's just a bit too undeveloped."
2,The Title Told,"I felt very disappointed after I had found that this book was merely a 'yellowpage' listing all the colleges that offered certain fields of study programs. That is exactly what the title of the book has suggested! The book is nearly 700-page thick but I find that only few pages are really useful. If you once had a chance to have a glimpse to the inside of this book in a bookstore, just looked up what you want and left the book on the bookshelf. But still be disappointed by the fact that there were no rankings and no reasonably detailed descriptions of programs. Thanks Amazon.com to have offered a lower price."
4,"Elegant pattern, nifty pillow, pricy","I love the Croscill Townhouse, Dunhill (Dover Manor), Winslow and Love Letter patterns and have tons of them all over my house. This pillow has a nice style and falls in between the ""Square"" and ""Fashion"" finished pillows in the Townhouse line. But watch the price, currently $60."
4,Coca-Cola Monopoly,"As a collector of Monopoly boards, I thoroughly enjoyed the nostalgia of this Classic Ads game. I also bought one for my friend who collects Coca-Cola items and she loved it too :)"
5,One of the best live bands I have EVER seen,"I had to pleasure of seeing Hipbone play countless times. The shows were always full of energy and great music. They are a great combination of many types of music but mainly they just have funky jazz type of sound. I hated when this group went their different ways. The great thing is that they recorded this live CD so can you tell how good of a live band they were. These are 4 great musicians and if you love bands that will just jam out a song and not play the typical 4 minute song then this is the group for you. They were by far the best group the Raleigh Durham area had to offer during their time together. Do yourself a favor and pick up a copy of the CD and give a band you may not have heard of a listen. Really give a listen to Built, Nina and Wicked some of my favorites."
4,this version is a bit old but useful,"i have the 3rd edition and it looks really old. i mean the style of the printing. a lot of them look like it is scanned from hand drawn pieces. i have no problems with that. i just got used to it. information-wise, it provides much of what your need to know about architecture conventions. i have a copy of AIA's architectural graphic standard, 11th edition. it couldn't compare to this one. this one is specifically written according to building types so you know what to look for when you encounter one program of your building such as a loading dock or auditorium. it is also easy to navigate from the contents list. good to have when designing your building."
5,More fun coloring! :),"I always loved Winx Club coloring books when I was younger. :)In this one, there's also an iron-on you can cut out and iron-on to a white shirt. You can also: figure out a secret code on page 3, connect the dots to see what Bloom's pet looks like on page 6, help Bloom find her way from Earth to Magix on page 7, draw what fairy you would be on page 19, connect the dots to see what the witches want on page 25, and help the Winx g irls get past the witches to school. :)So much fun! :D"
4,Solid Sing-Sing,"On par with Sing-Sing's first release.""Modern Girl"" ""I Do"" and ""Going Out Tonight"" will bring back memories of the Lush sound. All very listenable, instantly likeable solid pop tracks."
3,Too much of a pop sound,"Sing-Sing isn't Lush and I get that. Even so, there's more of a pop sound to this album than their previous ones. Some songs, like Mister Kadali, I just skip entirely."
5,dynamite!,"I highly recommend this CD to all jazz, pop, and modern music fans. Some of the jazz tunes are a bit basic, but the string adaptation of jazz is superb, the playing is enthusastic, and the pieces that use a mix of styles are mesmerizing. Go for it!"
5,"great film, deeply moving",forget what the Catholic church tells you about this film. the priests in the film want to stay with the Church in spite of bad eggs which abound in their surroundings as with any bureaucracy. this is a great film about the possibilities of human understanding and trueness to the deeper values that Jesus taught. i have a feeling Jesus would haved loved the two priest leads in this film more than he would the priests who condemned it.
4,linus roache knocks the ball out of the park!,"in this gritty depiction of catholicism, linus roache shows he has earned his spurs from his talent versus resting on the laurels of his famous father. the movie covers three conflicts with traditional catholic values: celibacy, whereby ordained ministers are expected to forego sex; homosexuality, which is totally off limits; and the secrets of the confessional, when everything told to the priest is to held in strict confidence.roache and tom wilkerson (of masterpiece theater fame) are the clerics trying to handle these issues in a morally opaque environment. not for those who can not face dealing with these issues, but an excellent movie for those who like to be challenged during their entertainment."
5,heart-wrenching & provocative,"Linus Roache was marvelous (not to mention kinda cute) in this intense movie. As a Catholic who isn't blind to the faults of my religion, I'm glad that someone was brave enough to challege the dogma of the Church."
3,"Good Church setting, lousy plot","""Priest"" (SPOILERS AHEAD) was about a young idealistic priest who could not ignore his own sexual needs or his inner conflicts over the demands of his position. It was most successful in showing the interactions within a small poor urban Catholic community. The way the congregants reacted to things mirrored what I had seen in protestant congregations as a child, and helped me to understand more about how the modern Catholic church operates. The young priest, who had a homosexual lover and was caught by the police on a morals charge, seemed a little too dense at times. I got tired of his deer-in-the-headlights behavior, and could not believe that consensual sex between two men would generate a 40-point headline in a local tabloid. I gave it an A for the church story and a D for plot development."
1,HATE SPEECH,"""Priest opened after it was originally scheduled for a Good Friday debut. The Disney-Miramax film not only showed five priests with serious problems, it also placed responsibility for their dysfunction on the Church. Two priests were having affairs, one with a woman, the other, with a man. A third priest was a drunk, another was psychotic, and the bishop was evil and cruel. There was not one well-adjusted priest in the film. The Church was depicted as the cause of all the troubles; the celibacy requirement was targeted. Stereotypes abounded which served to stigmatize the Church and presented it as contemptible and destructive. Director Antonia Bird said her feeling about the Church ""seethe[d] with rage."" Jimmy McGovern, the writer, called the priests that he knew as a child ""reactionary bastards."" -Catholic League Annual Report on Anti-Catholicism"
1,Attrocious,As opposed to many other viewers who were left teary eyed at the end of this film. I was outraged.The gay priest has no problems breaking his vows of celibacy and acting on his homosexual impulses. But he is reluctant to break the confession of a young girl (who is obviously begging him for help)who is being repeatedly raped by her own father. This is hypocrisy in its highest form. I can scarcely believe that people are sidding with this morally reprehensible man. I was hopping the entire movie the congregants would reject him for his two faced hyporcrisy. I don't know. Either this film is wrongly conceived or children just don't matter anymore.It made me ashamed as a Christian. No wonder the secular world is disgusted with the Church.
1,the attack to Catholic Church,"This movie is very obvious to degrade the priesthood in the Catholic church. The producers certainly do not respect the religion itself and express the dissatisfaction by throwing this garbage. They don't see the holiness the Church always trying to do. It is too bad. One thing that I can say, that they need very strong prayers to save their souls and blindness"
2,Spend the extra bucks,"I am a big fan of Teledyne products and this shower head is MAYBE worth the $5, I don't know. By the time I tightened it enough (yes, I used plumbers putty) that it didn't leak the plastic in the shower collar fractured. The head still leaks so I should have spend a few extra bucks and bought a metal jobby. All in all, you get what you pay for...."
4,"Will definitely save your floors, but stay away from clear...","I love this product and get them directly from Softclaws. My 55 lb boxer mix is very active and wears through his before his nails grow out. If you have a similarly active dog the nail caps wont last 4 to 6 weeks- I start replacing caps on his front feet within a week (he's a digger). But is it worth the extra expense to save our vintage hardwood. I suggest going with any color but clear- the clear caps seem to be made of a less flexible material or thickness, and they slip right off my dog's claws."
3,moderately interesting,"Not a novel that will be considered great in science fiction. But Lerner does demonstrate an ingenious twist to the standard First Contact plot. It's a build out of a short story that appeared in Analog. More flesh on the bones of the characters. And an ending that goes beyond what appeared in Analog. If you never read the latter, then just knowing what I've written here, you should be able to identify where the original ending was in the story.The action scenes are fairly limited. Not up to the combat sequences in a Weber, Ringo or Stirling book. As for the characters, I had trouble identifying with them. They seemed rather flat. But perhaps Lerner will improve over time."
3,'Killing Car' = Killing Time...,"As a Jean Rollin fan (for the most part) I have to say I was bored by this film from start to finish. This type of flick, along with the horrid 'Sidewalks Of Bangkok', are simply not his forte - he`s good at the dreamy, surreal, hypnotic mythos of vampire lore, the waking dead, occult and Eurocult tidbits that aren`t plot or narrative driven. His attempt at an action flick misses the mark completely. He can't seem to use the low-budget to his benefit in this one, it`s poorly lit, badly paced, weak on action and there`s only one Asian woman in the flick undraped, and not nearly often enough for a Rollin film. Skip this one and grab 'The Living Dead Girl', 'Night Of The Hunted' or 'Fascination' from the same time period and you`ll see what I mean. 'Killing Car' means killing time..."
3,Arrogant Fella,"Though his book is extremely well written, Bill Z. (Billsy :-) tends to overvalue ""standard"" English. In fact, he's downright arrogant.Here's an example of what Billsy writes in his book: ""I can't handle an A-plus mind expressing itself in C-minus sentences."" The mind and sentences being those of Richard Feynman.Ultimately, Zinsser unwittingly makes the statement of how very-very far we must go before educated people in positions of de facto power who spout things such as ""writing to learn""/ ""learning to write"" and people doing hard core intellectual work, yet maintain their humanity, understand each other.Personally, I can't handle a C-minus mind expressing itself in A-plus sentences. A good example are the mind and sentences of Bill Zinsser.In short, arrogant ""Fellas"" like Bill should simply have a set of bongo-drums smashed down on their heads...just kidding.For less arrogance and better understanding read Rudolph Flesch's ""How to Write, Speak and Think More Effectively."""
2,Not what I expected...,"Too artsy fartsy. Not well organized. I couldn't tell the writing samples from the analysis. Chapter headings didn't help. Maybe different formatting would have helped. As is, difficult to plow through."
5,A Masterpiece of scholarship,I totally agree with tifepiphany! The work is a gift to all who love 17th Century poetry / George Herbert / and poetry of the highest level. The Critical Introduction alone makes this a necessary book - the re-creation of the text and a generous selection of facsimile prints on corresponding pages make this a delight! Do yourself and favor and buy this book... I bought 2 copies. Books like this usual cost 50 to 60 dollars. Thank you Mario Di Cesare for this amazing work that should set a new standard for scholarly re-creations of texts - especially for those of us who can not afford $150.00 facsimiles. This is now one of my most beloved books.
5,Great read!,"Once again Patricia Rosemoor has given her readers a great story filled with action and romance. This time, the Florida swamp setting stirs up the heat and enhances the mystery. Highly recommended."
5,"More of the same, only different","A rather special follow-up to the previous, self-titled album, and one that is guaranteed to polarise the fans. Personally I love it, with the exception of one or two tunes (P.C. Keen, most notably). The more mainstream style would seem to mirror the Levs settling down a bit in their old adage, but as they've always said, ""Home is where you make it"", and if that's what they choose... the protests are still there, particularly in the vitriolic Hope Street and Maid of the River, but it seems the band is settling down to enjoy themselves, and credit to them if this is the result. Even Men-an-Tol seems to be a look back with a pang of regret at their earlier, more radical days.Enjoy it, it's great."
2,Flour sack towels,"These were larger than I wanted and not absorbent enough - they are pretty and nice quality but not suited to being used as dishtowel, which is what I was hoping for. Good value as long as you know what you are getting."
4,"Fast shipper, as described","Fast shipper, as described Fast shipper, as described Fast shipper, as described Fast shipper, as described Fast shipper, as described .v. .f.v. .f."
3,"Good disks, no bums so far. Needs help with shipping and handling.","The item is just as shown and described. Shipping took a while, apparently the first shipment was misdirected somehow, but they eventually reached me. I have to take another star off for the packaging. Item was just rattling around in an over-sized box with no padding at all and the outer case was cracked up the side."
1,Think twice!!!!,"The company did a great job sending it to me on time, BUT the scent is WAY watered down, and I get the notion Kingdom is discontinued, and the remaining stock is just sitting around in a warehouse and literally fading away. I should have known the slashed prices and the fact Kingdom is impossible to find in retail stores was a bad sign.When I sprayed it on the first time I knew immediately the actual scent part was almost gone and the only thing left was the alcohol suspension.It's a shame because I adored this perfume.For a second I thought it was counterfeit, but it smelled too weak to be a fake, which would have at least made an effort to try to smell like the full strength real version.I am very, very disappointed, obviously all that's left of Kingdom is limited stock, way past its expiration date, and they're just trying to get rid of it."
4,What a picture he paints!,"I for one am glad Baxter couldn't sleep, and when he was roaming in the park, he came across his neighbors, Bradley and Bradley!!The quick-reading chapters are provided by Baxter's characters, making the story read like a ""book within a book"". Each chapter is a tale told by an individual character. As each shares their story of love and loss, they ultimately meet, and inter-twine with each other, giving us a full portrait.We are reminded after reading this, that love indeed, comes in all shapes; sizes; wants and needs. Baxter has touched a nerve with many, he has also opened hearts of others, by sharing the lives and loves of the people we meet in The Feast of Love.I too have had feelings and thoughts like the characters here. Some painful, some humerous, but most of all, loving. That's life folks - so, pick up a copy of the book, join Baxter on his walk in and around Ann Arbor, and meet his ""works of art""."
2,Wait until it comes out in paperback...,Mildly entertaining but there is not enough substance to engage the reader. The one interesting character was a young employee of the protagonist. The character of the protagonist was not fleshed out at all.
2,"Not a Feast, Not a Snack...It Is A Scrap","The characters in this book are memorable, but generally not believable. If it weren't for the genuine, sad Jewish couple who's son torments them in his insanity, I would have thrown out this book without finishing. The teenage character Chloe's dialogue is sometime profound, but so out-of-character, the words become ridiculous. There is more hate and discord in this book than love.Charles Baxter's attempt to align himself with William Shakespeare's ""Midsummer Night's Dream"" is a shameless attempt at greater book sales. Mr. Baxter's opinion of the value of his own writing is shocking.Most books I read I pass on to friends when I'm finished. This one went into the recycling."
1,This book is an insult to my intelligence,"This book could have been good if Baxter had made it into a comedy rather than a lame attempt at being profound. A guy's wife leaves him to become lesbian...then his next wife leaves him to be with a previous lover. So sad. A girl's wonderful husband dies but fortunately she just knows that she'll someday meet a reincarnated version of him...oh how wonderful, why can't we all be so romantic?It's basically a book about stupid people doing stupid things and believing they've found something profound. You can sympathize with the characters but don't expect to find them reasonable human beings."
3,There Are Better Books out There,"Meh. I'd say this is the most mediocre book I have read in a long time. It was strongly recommended to me by a friend and, since it was a finalist for the National Book Award a few years ago, I thought it might be worth reading. Now I remember why I respect the Booker Prize so much more than the National Book Award. The novel was fine-I'm not sorry I read it-but it is really not much more than a good story without a lot of substance behind it. I prefer novels that are more likely to make me ponder. The one literary element that really had potential, the book's namesake painting, was woefully underused as nothing more than an explanatory device. Probably not an author I'll try again."
3,Feast of love novel - review,"Glad to have recieved the book several weeks earlier than expected. Was very cheap. However it did not match the description, as it should have been a hardback and I could have saved myself some money so not very please about that."
2,When marketing is more important than substance,"The only justification for the glowing reviews for this book must be that the publisher is trying to push the writer.This book was read by myself and my monthly book club, after being suggested by the local bookstore owner. Of the six members, not one enjoyed the entire book.Sure, there were amusing snippets. Mostly due to Chloe's character. The rest should never have left the editor's desk."
2,not interesting,"i was influenced by the reviews. read the first few pages before buying the book, it seemed interesting then. as i read along, i loss interest and do not seem to want to continue reading. i have since put the book down and have yet to finish, and do not intend to for now. perhaps sometime later i will try again."
1,A COLLEGE PROFESSOR TRIES TO BE CLEVER,"As another reviewer wrote, I also cannot understand why this book got such good reviews. Baxter is a college professor, and the book has the feeling of someone ""looking down"" on the people seen from the window of his ivory tower and trying to write something clever about them. It's condescending, big time, especially towards the female and younger characters. ..."
2,This is about infatuation and self-serving love.,"This book is badly titled. It is as if a gifted junior high or high school student had written it. Naturally, he deserves an A in English Composition, and naturally the other school students will think it's cool. But this book says nothing about love and responsibility as shared by adults. Amusing, yes. Profound, no."
3,It's just OK / mixed feelings,"I ""accidentally"" acquired this book from a book club, if you know what I mean, and I was bored by it and wasn't particularly enjoying it. But as I slogged on through, I did come to recognize that Charles Baxter is in fact a talented writer and at times I found myself saying ""wow, that's so perfectly stated."" I'm not rating this book higher than 3 stars because, in all honesty, Charles Baxter is just not my type of writer. I inellectually, I recognize his skill and art, but it just doesn't strike a chord with me. To me, his characterizations of the young couple, Chloe and Oscar, didn't ring true. Somehow they seemed as an ""older guy's idea of a hot young couple."" Other readers might disagree with me, but I just felt the characterization was either a little lacking or too forced. But maybe that's just me."
3,Wordy,I found only slight simularities between the book and the movies. I felt that at times the words overtook the emotions of the character.
4,From Ann Arbor,"I enjoyed this book quite a bit, but I think I particularly enjoyed it because it clearly takes place in Ann Arbor, where I live. I could envision all the settings about which he wrote, the neighborhood park he visited at night, the stadium, and the drive across town after the football game. The characters he describes are all very true to the college town that Ann Arbor is. His writing style keeps me engaged. I really enjoyed it."
2,abit confusing to read,"this story drug along a bit much for me and it is rather confusing to read. i couldn't quite get a grip on the story until midway through the book and i know i am not illiterate and i'm even a college grad. i really liked the book after 1/2 way through, but what kind of enjoyment of reading is that?!most of the other reviewers liked this book a lot, so i'm definitely in the minority here, so maybe you should read this and see if i'm not being fair. with all of the serious happenings and insecurities of this past month, i'm probably just not myself. but this is certainly not one of my favorite books."
3,REALITY SHINES THROUGH THE ARTIFICE,"Like so many other recent novels (think of Sontag's IN AMERICA), the author jump-starts the book with the ""reality"" of author intrusion into the artifice of narrative. But soon, the narrative takes over & becomes reality. This makes the author's intrusions all the more annoying, especially in the final section which a good editor would have prevailed upon the writer to cut, cut, cut. There is some fine writing here & individual sections can be a pleasure to read, though some of the characters verge on stereotype (the older Jewish couple & the younger ""hip"" couple). This is highly readable and engaging in an environment subject to interruptions (waiting rooms, etc.), but not the best choice for a compelling experience."
4,I recommend it,"This is the first book I have read by Baxter. I especially liked the diversity of its characters and their thinking. It is very colorful to read, a delight. I passed the book on immediately."
1,Just Terrible,The writing is banal & the characters are barely one dimensional. The plot(such as it is...)is a poor attempt to modernize Shakespear. It's like a poorly pieced together puzzle (in that nothing seems to fit). The relationships between the characters seems forced. I paid $1.00 for this book & I was grossly overcharged.
2,"Should be called the ""feast of sex'","The book has an interesting structure and the writing is solid. However, many of the characters (especially the women) don't ring true. The story is very focused on the sex that transpires beteween the characters...which can be related to love but isn't the same thing. He doesn't flesh the relationships to what I'd describe as love, so the whole story struck me as shallow."
2,"never coheres, never believable","too bad. i've read stories by baxter that i've liked. but this never reached me, and i was never sure that the author was really in control of what he was trying to do. who's the lead character here, for instance? the so-called ""punkette,"" chloe? she comes across as more like an older male's fantasy than as someone breathing and real. the whole book is marred by some cartoonish touches, such as having a character named bradley who also has a dog named bradley... it's not that meaningful or cute. the more i consider it, this book really ends up being small potatoes [an expression i don't normally use]."
4,A feast for the brain.,"This is a beautifully written, funny, touching story about love and it's many faces. Passion, longing, lust, and the unconditional love of a parent for a child are all weaved together in a creative and innovative style. This is a highly enjoyable book."
5,Feast your mind on this wonderful book,"Charles Baxter's masterpiece, ""The Feast of Love"" is a powerful piece of writing. The story is told through the eyes of several people whose lives become entwined with each other's. Everybody I have recommended this book to has loved it, and it got an ASTONINGSLY high marks (a 5 out of 5) by my book group. The book is very entertaining and deftly written and totally gets the reader into the minds of several interesting characters. It is one of those books that I could have read forever, and I bemoan the fact that it is only about 300 pages, whereas I easily could have read 1,000 pages of this wonderful, heart-breaking story.I do not wish to give away any part of the story, but let's just say that some of the most well-written intriguing characters live in this book, and I continually think of them as if I was part of their family.All I can say is drop everything you are doing and let yourself read this amazing work of fiction."
2,Overrated,"The reviewers have promised more than Charles Baxter can deliver. These are not real people. Nobody talks this way.There's something sad about about a tight-laced, uber-midwestern, middle-aged man trying to invent a couple of madcap stoner kids; in the first place I doubt that the way to become a love-happy laid-back dude is to have an evil, drunken, sex offender for a father.The ending of this book (and yes, it is too a novel) is both predictable and disappointing. You will not fail to note the page upon which we are invited to cry. You will also note (if you please) the page upon which we are to feel uplifted at long last.I do not recommend this book"
4,Delightful feast for reading!,"I really liked this! It seemed quirky at first, but as I continued the interweaving of the stories are more real and lifelike than any other I've read. Baxter spins the tales of the seemingly unconnected people - and you find yourself traveling the threads and realizing the connectedness of everyone. The humour of love is barely concealed beneath the surface of what initially seems like a series of bad love mistakes. I enjoyed every word of this novel and while I would have wished for a 'happier' ending I was not disappointed in the least. The humans are real and fallible and even the dogs are amusing. Highly recommend this excellent story."
3,Intimate slice-of-life in everyday setting,"This is a nice book, with a variety of brooding characters who are involved in different love affairs. I enjoyed the dreamy quality of the prose and how all the characters lives, although mundane, were described in a poetic way, as if trascending their own existence.In summary, I found this book a pleasant and high-quality quick read.

2,Good story...Difficult to follow,"This was not a book that I looked foward to reading and finishing, but I did finish it. The first 3/4 of this novel was dry and very hard to follow, in my opinion. The last few chapters were real interesting and enjoyable to read, so instead of 1 star, I gave this book 2 stars.This novel seemed like a survey, of sorts, about relationships, commitment, and love between different couples of different generations. That was interesting but I find it hard to enjoy a book that is so difficult to know which couple is narrating, since it switched back and forth alot.This is not one of my favorites and it's not a book that I tell my friends ""you just have to read this"".Based on the other reviewers, I'm in the minority with my review. I do admire authors that will step out on a limb and write a little bit differently. I liked the story but I wasn't fond of the way the book was written."
2,Banal,"It should have been written in third person, as all the characters sound alike anyway. Young adults should be offended by the way he characterizes them as barely able to formulate intelligent sentences. The stories themselves were not moving."
3,A mediocre meal,"I think that portions of this book are very good and then others are not. The problem is, the parts I didn't like were so distracting that I think they took away from my overall enjoyment of what could be a very touching and inventive novel. Specifically, the voice of Chloe was so cloying I found myself skimming past them, but unfortunately, it is her voice that dominates the second half of the novel, and it becomes rather unavoidable. Her voice just didn't sound natural to me, like Baxter couldn't fully capture her immature scatteredness and make it read believably. I did really enjoy the voices of Diana and of Bradley, but they were too sparse to hold it all together for me."
4,Wonderful book - kindle version has spelling errors,"I really adored this book. It covers all the forms of love: hopeless, hopeful, resigned, rationalized, irrational, young, jaded... Love is a game of chance and circumstance and we are all participants which the author conveys with great skill and insight. This is an very thoughtful and well written book.I am deducting one star for the sole reason that the kindle version has numerous spelling errors. Irksome, but does not detract too much from the enjoyment of reading."
4,Good book!,"I selected this book because of the title alone. I was surfing Amazon one sleepless night a few weeks ago and the title caught my eye. When it arrived, I read it in about a week and a half. (I'm a busy gal.) The author has a different approach to writing, which I like. I didn't know what to expect when I read this book. I'm glad I selected the book on the title alone. It lived up to it 100%. This is a good book and it caused me to add more of Baxter's books to my wish list. Yay for new authors! :)"
5,Informative and shocking,"I found this book extremely well-researched and well-written, and shocking - shocking, because the facts presented are shocking. The fact that many countries are far worse in terms of disability rights does not mean that we in the US should be complacent - we still have a long, long way to go. Yes, the author's political views come across strongly, but they are also backed up and we can clearly see her reasoning, even if we do not agree with 100% of it.This book is not only of interest to people with disabilities or those concerned for them - the issues raised about health care and poverty in the US, for instance, affect us all. And indeed, I think that whenever human life is devalued and regarded as nothing more than a commercial commodity, it affects us all. The author's clear sense of outrage at the injustice she sees may put some off this book, but for me it made it all the more powerful."
4,Good for the reduced price,"Pretty sturdy scooter, doesn't turn but great for both indoors and outdoors, nonskid board surface, great for the reduced price of $7.99!"
5,Love it!,My daughter loves her Dora Skootskate - and the non-marking wheels are great since it's winter time and she's riding the skootskate in my house;o)
2,Just ok...,"As others have mentioned the stickers were peeling off, the paint on the bottom was cracking and the ""hardware"" was missing rendering the odd screws(?) and nuts useless. We managed to find some screws around the house though and get it put together (after an hour of frustration). It's definitely cheaply made but our 4 year old is having a great time on it for now, we'll see how long it takes to fall apart.Adding in... it's now been 20 minutes of playtime and he handle bar has loosed so badly that I am taking it away. Guess I'll spend a little more next time for a quality product."
4,Ok product for the price,"Got this for my 4 year old niece's birthday, she is really into Dora so she was happy with it. The skootskate is simple to put together, but not necessary the most durable materials. Then again, you get what you pay for. I got this on the Friday sale for ten bucks, along with some books so that there is no shipping charge. My niece is happy, so can't complain much about that."
3,dora skate board,it has dora which is great for girls but it isnt very good to ride or learn on. overall I would not purchase it again
1,"Garbage, complete garbage","What this is is a cheap skateboard, with a cheap metal bar stuck through it, with some Dora stuff pasted on last minute.Within the first day of using this, the Dora sticky-paper they put on the bottom of the skateboard (where your child puts their feet) was torn. Within two days, it was nearly completely destroyed. I tried to fix this with elmer's glue, but to no avail.Now I have a 'plain' scooter...I've seen this thing on sale for less than a ten-spot, it MIGHT be worth that price, but not any more..."
5,Nobody does it like Wy...,"That voice is a treasure! Good songs, brilliant voice... classic. This CD deserves a place in any collection. And, wow... if you ever get a chance to see Wynonna LIVE, do it! She puts on a GREAT concert! Enjoyed her so much."
1,"WYNONNA COME BACK FROM THE OTHER SIDE, WE MISS YOU.","Absolutely a awful, overproduced mess. Absolutely no good songs on this one. Forget about it."
3,It's missing something.,"""When Love Starts Talkin'"" has Wynonna singing with full soul and growl. It's toe-tapping, it's catchy----but it's missing something. That pretty much sums up the rest of the album. It's not bad at all, don't get me wrong. It's got a few keepers like ""Come Some Rainy Day,"" ""Love's Funny That Way,"" and ""The Wyld Unknown,"" but it's missing that sparkling touch Wynonna used to have. It's like it got lost in the shuffle somewhere. The album is full of soulful growls, but her high pitches are diminished. (This really shows when she's singing live.) ""The Other Side"" is not Wynonna's best and not her worst. It's just average and we all know she can do better than that. Too much soul, not enough artistic touch. I'm still waiting for the next album."
3,Not Up To Her Usual Standards,"Don't get me wrong, I'm a big Wynonna fan, but this one just doesn't match her past solo releases. Blues-rockers are usually her forte, but none of the ones here really stand out from anything she's done before. In particular, ""When Love Starts Talkin'"" & ""Troubled Heart and a Troubled Mind"" sound absolutely identical. ""Don't Throw Your Mojo On Me"", on which she teams up with guitarist Kenny Wayne Shepherd, is especially disappointing. This pairing had all the makings of a killer blues-rock song, but the result is a tame, almost corny rockabilly tune. Most of the ballads are also nothing special. The highlights come on the soft-rockers, ""Love's Funny That Way"", the title track, & ""Always Will"". The latter adds a nice Celtic flavor. Not a total loss, but it doesn't match any of her previous solo work."
1,Wynnona's cd The Other Side,"The Cd was totally blank, No music or voice at all, So I totally got took on that cd. Not happy at all."
5,The Best Salad Tongs,"These salad tongs fits so nicely in a salad bowl because of its easy fold lock. The design is right, the price it right, and makes a nice gift."
5,Cleans and protects brass so much better than 'Never Dull',"I spent hours and hours trying to remove the tarnish on my brass bed with 'Never Dull'. My fingers went numb and there was still lots of tarnish to remove.I bought Cape Cod and the difference was amazing. The tarnish came off much faster and the brass was incredibly bright.The Cape Cod polish leaves a protective coating so weeks later, the brass is still very shiny.Great stuff."
5,Great Product!,This is the best product of its type I have ever used. I had two pieces of sterling silver jewelry--an omega necklace and a pendant--that I was going to throw away as they looked like tin and I was unable to restore the shine with any kind of silver polish. As a last resort I tried Cape Cod and WOW--I have my jewelry back and looking better that it ever did. I highly recommend this product.
3,Ok-Didn't live up to my high expectations,"I used this product on a cartier stainless steel watch and after reading a review. I thought it would do the trick and remove surface scratches on the band and face. The product helped slightly but the scratches remain. Since my watch is in really good shape, I was hoping to avoid the $300 cleaning charge by Cartier. While the product didn't live up to my high expectations, I am sure it will work for many of you. This was my first time trying to polish metal, and I believe I expected too much from a simple cost effective cleaning cloth."
5,High Polish,"Better than some of the creams, Flitz, on the market. Non abrasive and high luster for most stainless steel bracelet or watch cases. One tin will last a long time."
3,MLT POLISHING CLOTH KIT,NOT SO CRAZY ABOUT THESE. EVERYTHING FEELS GREASY WHEN POLSHING WITH THESE AND THE PRODUCT HAS A VERY STRONG SMELL. THESE SEEM TO BE NO BETTER THAN OTHER SILVER POLISHING KITS I HAVE USED. WOULD NOT BUY AGAIN.
5,LOVE IT,"I have been usuing this product for years. I was THRILLED to find such a wonderful price that I bought 2 cans. I cannot recomend this product enough. Try it, you will love it."
4,Great for fine scratches and polishing,"Someone recommend I get these to polish the watch band on my Rolex. The product did a great job and is nice to have to touch up the watch band from time to time.I also used it on my Movado which had some scratches on the watch case that made me not want to wear the watch anymore, after some time the scratched were virtually gone. This is a must have for your watch/jewelry collection."
4,Heros of Might and Magic IV,"Haven't had much time do to other obligations, but will play through in next month"
3,"Pretty good, but...","I don't have high demands from a game, but it would be nice if there weren't so many easily fixed bugs. For example, when one looks at a spell in the spellbook, it reads %heroknows%spellname or something to that effect underneath a quote that doesn't tell much about the spell. Furthermore, some of these quotes read ""Removed"" or ""Deleted"".The game itself, however, is plenty of fun as turn-based fantasy strategy games go. For $10.00 (now $8.50), I'm satisfied. If Ubisoft is reading this, please release a patch for the game that will update it from v. 2.2 to v. 3.0, as the Ubi.com site only has patches up to v. 2.1. Why the company would release a game in Fall 2005 without incorporating the v. 3.0 patch that is out now is beyond me, but I would appreciate some Ubisoft patch because the 3DO v. 3.0 patch does not work for the Ubisoft release."
3,It's...different.,"Heroes of Might and Magic III was so great, it left me wondering how they could improve it. This game showed me that they couldn't, so they tried some new ideas. Some were good, like your heroes can actually participate in battle; in fact, you could have a group solely comprised of heroes. The artifacts are just weapons, armor, etc that you can buy for your heroes to improve them in combat...which works out pretty well actually. Come to think of it...everything involving the heroes was improved I think. However, other than that, it got worse. You can no longer really determine how far your units move in battle, there's a lack of money, lack of creatures, and a big thing, lack of maps that are ready to play. I guess you should look into this game...but maybe look for some more maps online first."
2,More of the same,"This game is so similar to HMM3, that at almost every turn, I feel a feeling of deja-vu. The combat is actually worse, as movement is imprecise, and animation can be laughable at times. Furthermore, the interface is horrific- especially city management and spellbook screens. However, when it comes to HMM, deja-vu isn't all bad, as the gameplay concept is solid. I just wish combat, animations, and the interface were better.Graphics: 2/5Sound: 2/5Gameplay: 3/5Interface: 1/5"
3,Take it or Leave it,"My 2 to 5 year old group of family and friends who absoutely LOVE ""Songs Fron The Park"" invariably get bored with this DVD and walk away from it. A few of the songs excite them somewhat but over all this is a take it or leave it video . . . more or less taken because that's whats in the machine. Give them a choice and they choose something else every time.Wouldn't waste my money if I was you.SandPit"
2,Maybe for older children,"I purchased this DVD for my daughter (20 months). She wouldn't even watch it the first few times I played it. We put it away for a couple months and now she will watch parts of it, but prefers other videos more. I can't comment on the voice issue as I don't watch enough Barney to really pay attention, and since we are recent Barney converts having a new cast doesn't bother me. The song are not very engaging though, there is a lot of talking, and really no songs that my daughter would recognize.How I rated*Educational value: the DVD does encourage reading and activity.Entertaining to children: my daughter doesn't really like this video all that muchEntertaining to adults: I can't stand to sit through it*cost: on par with most videosgeneral: nothing else really good to say about this, and in fact took a star away because of the annoying ads in the front. YOu have to fast forward through them and you can't simply skip to the menu. I hate this."
1,Where is the old Barney??,"I guess we have been away from the states TOO long. Barney's voice got more annoying then before. I bought this tape for my 15 month old. She really loved the More Barney Songs video. I bought this one to add to her collection, we all sat down to watch it - when Barney started to talk, he sounded like Elmer Fudd!! Anyhow, 5 minutes into the video, my daughter got up and went to her room and played with her toys. Our house will be sticking to the CLASSIC BARNEY tapes when he was lovably annoying, not NAUSEATING annoying...."
3,Hard to find item,Not as handy as the old ones these replace. You have to hang the towel by its hem to secure it. Not bad but could be a little easier with a little more engineering
5,Nice little towel grabber,Wanted it for my office to hold a towel. Works great and very convenient. Put it under my desk for a hand towel. Works great.
4,Just More of the Same Old Fang...,"As you can read from the excerpt, this author doesn't slight on the sensuality--which slides about a inch from **ick** at all times--or the descriptions of vampire behavior. SO if you don't read much in this genre, this is an excellent start. However, even though her characters are thoughtful and well developed and the plot clips right along, this just didn't make the mark for me. It's hard to figure out which character is where because the author tries to use multiple character voices--she labels the start of who is speaking--but it's annoying to switch voices back and forth in your head. Finally, I know we can't ""standardize"" the ""rules"" of vampire behavior, but some authors have vamps fly/or not, reflection in mirrors-windows/not, and if I read one more scene of a vamp drinking from a bag of blood from a blood bank...! Every genre reaches it's saturation point--cowboys, babies, etc--have we reached it with vampires and this book? Could be...."
3,Smokes but doesn't inhale,"Popular 90's alterna-pop isn't vapid enough to throw away just yet, but does blend easily together when not focusing on creating a few standout melodies."
2,"one-""hit"" wonder","This album is a typical example of a band who has one creative thought, releases a somewhat original and catchy single, but is unable to come up with anything else of any value. If you liked ""Sucked Out"", buy the single."
5,a very good album.,"not mixed very well, but the songwriting makes up for it. very full of energy and very very catchy. i've been listening to it for 3 years and it is still one of my favorites."
4,very nice music,"Got this CD for my brother who really wanted this one song from ""love me if you dare"" (a movie). Im pretty sure this is the only way to get that song :)i really enjoyed the whole CD! I'm not usually into those kinds of songs, but i do enjoy a capella! these guys have really amazing voices."
1,Beware,"This carafe DOES NOT fit DCC-1000 despite the website's claim that it fits Cuisinart 12-cup coffeemakers. It may fit other models, but definitely does not fit the DCC-1000."
1,Does NOT fit all 12 cup coffeemakers,"The writeup is incorrect. This does not fit all cuisinart 12 cup coffee makers, it definitely does not fit the dcc 1200. While returning it is not difficult through Amazon, it means a trip to UPS and another 2 weeks of waiting for a correct replacement."
3,I Agree With K & H Enthusiast,"I tried filing down the tabs on the lid to make them fit easier, but the tab on the carafe plastic still broke. Cuisinart needs to hire better coffee pot engineers. I'm buying the replacement carafe from Amazon because it's much cheaper than going through Cuisinart."
4,One of Rough Trade's best!,"""High School Confidential"" and ""Fashion Victim"" classic tunes - and ""Grade B Movie"" must have inspired the great b&w bit on ""In Living Color"" - Hello Johnny - hysterical!"
5,Quality product,I bought one of these 3+ years ago and I have had absolutely no problems with it. I leave it on auto and I often forget its on because its so quiet. I have seen the sensors catch odors or dust and this makes the fan speed up a little for a few minutes to clean the air more effectively. When I was researching air purifiers I really liked that one seemed to be quieter and had lower maintenance costs than many others. I've liked this so much that I've just bought a second one to get whole-house coverage. I wouldn't hesitate to buy this again.
2,notice it says nano in the description,I have read about the nano technology and in my opinion it is not proven safe. the nano steel are microscopic and may or may not be dispersed into the air you breathe?
3,"Nice, but not sure if it's worth the money","It is a very smart machine, switching speeds as it senses the air. But the claim that it is very silent is misleading. It is almost undetectable when running at low speed, but when it kicks into high speed, you better have your TV remote handy so you can crank up the volume. We'll see in the spring if it has a positive effect on my allergies. If it does, and I expect it will, it's worth the noise."
1,Stopped working after 14 days.,"***Edited since 1 star review was published***I had some issues with receiving a defective unit. I was at first upset but this company did everything possible to address my concerns and remedy the situation. I received a brand new, sealed replacement complete with new filters. They shipped my replacement via 2nd day air and also scheduled a UPS pickup for the defective item.I am saddened that my item stopped working after only 2 weeks, but this company is first class and took care of the problems with lightening speed and no questions asked.I highly recommend them, they are top-notch.I give my original product a 1 star, but I give this company 10 stars!"
1,Air Purifier does not work new out of the box.,"update: This is an excellent company. They have shipped me a new machine before I even returned the one that doesn't work. And THEY called ME, I didn't have to go after them. No worries here, folks!later review: Customer Service very responsive and fast. They will pay postage and send another unit. I would upgrade to two stars based on this, but can't add another star via this webpage.I checked the directions several times, checked the 'troubleshooting' page, the outlet is live. Unit does not power up. Very disappointed after reading all the glowing reviews. Am interested to discover how their customer service will be.I would still like to try the product."
5,A Powerful Difference,"We own a smaller home (1200 sqft) and have three children, three dogs and two cats. We purchased the RabbitAir BioGS to attempt to clean the environment in our home. I can't overstate the affect it has had on the air.I hope I don't gross anyone out here, but I want to provide evidence to how well this thing works. Having said that, one of the very real ways you can tell is the stuff (or lack of) that comes out of your nose! After two months of using this machine, we have noticed a huge difference in dust etc. that gets caught in the computer intake, on the furniture, in the vents and in our noses.Also, you can just tell a difference in the air quality. We live in the Atlanta area and are often under air restrictions. But at least inside our home we know that the air is much cleaner and healthier than outside.I highly recommend this machine. It is easy to use, well-made, and above all else, delivers noticable results."
4,Product seems to be doing fine....,"This air purifier seems to be working well. It is definitely dirty inside when we go to clean it regularly. It looks much nicer than most other purifiers I have seen. It is a bit more deep than I thought it would be, for some reason I thought I could possibly hang it on a wall, but that isn't the case. The remote works fine, but is flimsy. It's operation is definitely quiet, although it does rattle the cabinet I currently have it on top of, so it must vibrate slightly as it works. So far, so good."
4,very very good.,delivery was quick - item arrived perfectly and most importantly it does what it promised. i use the aircleaner in my bedroom and you can just feel the freshness. i used it in my living room and thought it wouldn't make a difference. it has. my asthmatic sister says she doesn't wheeze when at our home. and guess what - me too.the product is very sleek and quiet. it'll rev up the engines once in a while when there's extra pollution.this air cleaner has truly made a difference. prior to this we had purchased 2 expensive cleaners from sharper image. both conked out quickly.
4,First impressions,"It came on time, came out of the box alright and was a breeze to set up. I've never even seen one used before so this was a big experiment. I bought it for the kitchen (poorly ventilated but huge) to see if it helps. So far it's passed the onion / garlic / cooking prawns test with only minimal residual smell. Living in an asian household, the big test will be smelly fish, fried chilli and lemon grass and the inevitable fish sauce - I'll let you know how I get on but impressed for now."
3,Pretty good Air Purifier. Great Rabbit Service!,"I've had this unit running in my house for about 8 months now and I do think it has made a difference. We have three dogs in a somewhat small space >1,000 sq. ft. so it is not without challenges. The unit triggers on when anything smelly or ""dirty"" happens near it (such as hair spray. The three filters are great because you can vacuum the first filter every couple of days or once a week. I recently replaced the charcoal and middle filter because the light came on. Based on reviews from others I chose to not wash the charcoal filter and replace instead. Great service from Rabbit."
4,cute birdbath,"rather small, but just the right size for hanging from a tree limb...and the birds seem to enjoy it."
3,Nice product,"The quality of this product is good. I liked the price and the concept. Haven't had any birds come to it yet, which surprises me since I have over 10 feeders and attract a lot of birds into my yard. I'll keep it clean and filled and hopefully the birds will start using it soon."
5,A book about the eroticism in writing and of writing.,"Sadly often difficult to find; thankfully recently reprinted, On Being Blue stands as a must read for anyone who loves language--writer or reader. Gass' prose instructs as it entertains and enlightens. This gem of a book purports to be about a single word. Blue. Yet it manages, in a very few pages, to speak cogently of how all words gather meaning ""like lint in a deep pocket,"" of the blueness (eroticism) in writing and of writing"
1,Dazzling,"Gass is a dazzling writer, vastly too dazzling sometimes. Buy Omensetter's Luck, if you have not read it, plus click on In the Heart of the Heart of the Country & plead for reprinting. The first book of Gass litcrit, Fiction and the Figures of Life, in which Gass wonders about the wisdom of writing like Gass would soon be writing himself, is also awfully interesting. Have a ball, if you just must buy this book, but know that you are contributing to general academic diddling."
5,Great Customer Service,"We got the Rum Runner Cruise Kit for Xmas. We thought it was such a great idea that we got some for our friends. However when purchasing more, we realized we didn't know who originally gave us the set, and might be gifting back to them, the same thing they had given us. So I called the 1800 number. It was promptly answered, and James was exceeding nice about my odd request of who gave us the present. He went though his records and let us know that it was a relative. In an age of people in a hurry, it was very refreshing to work with a company with good customer service."
5,Easy travel,"I purchased the rum runner cruise kit to save money. With the average cost of a mixed drink on the ship = $8, the kit payed for itself the first few hours!! Easy to travel with, no questions from security. I even plan on filling them up and throwing them in the cooler for boating season this summer."
4,RUM RUNNER IS AWESUME,"Rum Runner Cruise KitTHIS KIT WORKED AWESUME ON OUR DEC CRUISE GOT THROUGH THERE XRAY SYSTEM OF OUR LUGGAGE LOOKING FOR THE FORBIDDEN BOTTLES OF PARTY FAVORITES!!MADE IT ALL THE WAY FROM IDAHO TO THE CARRIBEAN WITH LOOSING A DROP,SURE BEATS THEIR OVERPRICED DRINKS AND THE 15% SURCHARGE FOR NOTHING.THE ONLY THING THAT COULD BE IMPROVED ON IS THE CAP CLOSING SYSTEM.GOING CRUISING YOU HAVE TO HAVE 1-2 OF THESE!!!!"
4,Can't wait to use this,Bought this for a cruise to Alaska. Our luggage will be taken from to airport straight to the ship. I will post again and let you all know how they worked.
5,You can take it with you!!! Rum Runner,My husband and I took the larger of the two bags on our most recent cruise. It worked great. Never was detected. Did NOT leak. Yay!
3,"First Impressions, so-so","Bought from Amazon, shipped super fast (which is a plus) shiped in VERY flimsy packaging VIA USPS. Surprisingly it made it intact. I would suspect that if this item shipped in winter, the funnel would have cracked/shattered in below freezing temps, potentially puncturing the flasks. Seems the seller is banking on reviews, because there was more paperwork asking to post reviews than in instructions. Heading on a cruise in the next month or so, will post a more indepth review once I return."
3,"Defective, but repairable.","On all three of the smaller 8oz bottles, the heat seals at the top of the flask, opposite the nozzle, separated. The first one, I was rinsing it out with hot water per the directions, when it sprayed all over my kitchen. I fired up the iron to full temp, put the seal between two pieces of strong paper and ironed over where the seal should be a few times. The plastic melted back together, and although not aesthetically pleasing, it seems to be holding fluids just fine. Other than that, no complaints so far."
5,It works!,"I bought this for a 7-day cruise and I'll never cruise again without my Rum Runners. My luggage went through the screening process with no problems at all. One of the 3 large pouches did leak a tiny bit, but I put them each in large ziploc bags so it wasn't a problem. The Rum Runners took a ton of stress out of my cruise. While my friends wrung their hands over buying $10 drinks (or just blindly ran up huge tabs) I drank freely with no worries about the cost!If I cruise again, I'll buy another set for mixers. The only free drinks on my cruise were lemonade, iced tea and some juices in the morning."
3,Work well,I havent got to use these much yet but they will come in handy. I found that one of them leaks so if your traveling with it you might want to baggy it as well so that you dont mess up your other belongings
4,Great for cruises!,"We bought these to bring on a cruise and make it through the security check with flying colors. Great to be able to make our own cocktail before dinner! One note - they are a bit hard to clean, so you may want to get one for each different thing - hence only the 4 stars instead of 5"
5,Terrific product,"Whoever invented these should win some type of prize. We took them on a recent vacation with the family and it was SO nice not to be hauling heavy glass bottles around. Plus, they fit very nicely in our suitcases (I used a zip lock bag around them .. just in case). They didn't leak and were easy to fill and pour out of. (Note: We purchased several sets and our kids ended up taking them as they loved them so much. Now we need to buy some for us.)"
5,these things worked great in luggage !,we used these to take alcohol on-board a cruise ship. i had them wrapped in my towels and divided up in our luggage. our bags were x-rayed and i can only presume that they were not detected because they were still in there. worked fabulous and saved us a couple hundred dollars easily.
5,Worked great !,Worked great on our cruise ! The larger bags are wonderful for your favorite adult beverages. Went right through ships security and made our trip much more pleasurable having a beverage when we wanted and saved us some money by not paying their prices. Great product!!!
4,Not completely full proof...,"My husband and I just got back from a cruise to Alaska on NCL, we brought all 3 large Rum Runners, and one flask full of alcohol. We decided to put all of them in separate bags. 2 runners and the flask got through but the 3rd one did not. We had to go pick up his bag in the naughty room, they said he had scissors or an electric iron (he didn't have either and nothing that would resemble either) but when they guy searched through his bag he knew what he was looking for. Once he brought it out he gave it to another guy, who took it, opened it, and smelled it. Then came over and said we would not get it back, even at the end of the cruise.All and all I would recommend them, but just don't expect to get away with it completely. They are very durable and ours didn't leak at all, I did put them in a Ziploc bag just in case though. I wouldn't recommend buying expensive alcohol in case you do lose it."
5,Great!,"It was very helpful! They hold a lot of liquid also, no problems, no detection! Thanks so much, I will definitely be using these again."
2,You WILL get caught!,"WARNING Carnival cruise WARNING 4/2011--ConfiscatedAnd you WILL NOT get them back.They will confiscate and keep these, you will never see them again (and yes they drink them, duh).Great quality etc, BUT...They were really on top of this"
1,"Cute graphics, but difficult and boring","I have to admit that I bought this game mostly because I thought that the sheep were adorable, not to mention that I needed a new game and I was bored. I had played the demo and found it fairly amusing, but I can tell you that the game gets old really fast. The first few levels aren't too difficult, and the game was fairly interesting. As the game progressed, however, it got more and more difficult and I got more and more bored. It was not uncommon for me to lose most or all of my sheep to cows in armor, grinding machines, or comets. The sheep were incredibly stupid and resisted my attempts to herd them. I assumed that I would get better the longer I played, so I kept trying. However, the game didn't prove interesting enough to justify my time and effort. I played the game right after I bought it, but I haven't looked at it since. Unless you plan a career which involves working with idiotic animals who seem to hate you, I would not recommend this game."
3,too difficult,"bought it for my gf, as I saw from the reviews girls love it.at first she did like it, the cute sheep and so on.but she gave up after a couple hours.it's just too difficult for those girls who's not a gaming fan but looking for cute cartoon figures moving under their finger tips."
1,Incomprehensible for Students,"I previewed this film in hopes of running it for my 10th grade world history class. Usually, I find History Channel productions to be relatively good, but this piece is abominable. The narrator's voice is difficult to hear over the sound effects and music, and even when it can be heard, his phrasing and word choice is so pompous and garrulious as to be incomprehensible by students. Granted: students find most documentaries to be boring, but this one would inpsire a lynch mob. P.S.: The running time given in the product details above is not correct. The film runs 100 minutes, not 50."
3,Better than a stick in the eye!,"Once Gatzen gets past his esoteric rumblings, it's a pretty good video. The tom tuning section is by far the best part of the video, while the snare and bass drum sections are somewhat lacking in detail.Dale"
2,I like Bosch but DON'T buy this saw!,"I generally like Bosch equipment but this saw is one to stay away from. I am a general contractor and have used this saw for many different applications. It does work well enough in the beginning but I'm now sending it back for the second time to be serviced. Luckily Bosch has an absolutely fantastic warrantee program. But I probably only have about 8-12 hours on the saw. Here are my opinions:Pros: comfortable, good ergonomics, built-in joist hanger is nice, detachable cord a good idea (but not well designed).Cons: powercord hoop/hook on saw a pain to get the cable into and out of, trigger had to be replaced in first year and after about another 2hrs of use has stopped working again. The service center guys said that the internal switches are too complex to withstand all the vibration and have been a chronic problem.I'd recommend going with another saw until Bosch comes out with a new model."
5,great saw,"had this saw for over a year and was happy to pull it out of the case every time i needed it. i did not find anything wrong or about it. the only thing: make sure you buy it with a cord otherwise you will have to get the cord separately. the case is to small to fit the entire power cord, so my solution to that was to get this small cord adapter that i left permanently inside the saw (otherwise there is a possibility of braking the plug in power pin and then the saw will be useless). the led lights are very handy, i am working in tight and often dark places. the metal hook on top is just great idea i wonder why not every tool has this thing (i would hang it on 2by4's, ladder and what not.this saw broke down after i gave it to my helper and he broke it while the saw sustained a great deal of abuse for a whole day of work.now i am about to buy a new saw and it will be bosch rs20 again unless i see something extremely much more appealing."
1,"watch for the undisclosed ""GOTCHA""","Amazon is selling the saw without any power cord at all, and does not bother to disclose this in their promotional materials.Home Depot is selling the same saw WITH POWER CORD for only $159.Have you priced 25' extension cords with #12 wire lately???????Shame on you, Amazon."
4,If I can understand it...,"Little background. I'm a trucker in the summer, and a short order cook in the winter. I loved this book. I first bought a used copy of the fourth edition, and after a few years I have purchased the 10th edition with the modern physics. That stuff I still have trouble with.I got these cause I had a ton of questions about how stuff works. And they break it down. I had done well in Physics before, but this was a whole new ball game. The mathematics is not explained especially well, but the physics behind it is. And once you understand that, the math comes.For those of you who knock this book, well, they must be doing something right, cause 1) their on the 10th edition. and (2) They were able to reach a shmoe like me."
1,"Warning, does not contain Modern Physics",This book is missing the last few hundred pages of modern physics. If you intend to use that section buy a different edition.
2,unimpressed,"The format in this book is confusing and the pictures take up so much space you can't tell what is text and what is describing the picture. The problems in the back of each chapter are increasingly difficult to the point of insanity. Pray to whatever you hold to be sacred that your teacher does not assign any problems past number 45. There are answers provided in the back of the book, but on many occaisions, they are wrong. I am also tired of physics books talking about monkeys getting shot and falling out of trees. If any of you out there are thinking about writing a physics text, LEAVE THIS EXAMPLE OUT, PLEASE."
2,APC does not make them like they used to,"We have an SUA750 at work so I looked at its waveform output (using an oscilloscope) with a desktop computer and LCD monitor running from the backup. When I disconnected the SUA750 from the power grid and it switched to battery, it did NOT provide a perfect sine wave output. The crests and troughs were flattened for approx. 10% of the voltage amplitude (top and bottom each). Along with the flattening there was a small ripple on the leading edges. If APC is going to charge a premium for SmartUPS's they should step up the quality of the output. I can remember a time when the original BackUPS and SmartUPS's produced good sine waves when on battery and were worth the extra cost."
4,UPS Quality Can Only Be Observed When It Fails,"Pressed by Amazon to provide a review, I do so with some trepidation. UPS devices are invisible in practice when they work, and you notice them only when they don't.This unit has been in service for six months, during which time i have had several short power outages that my computers didn't notice -- precisely the point of a UPS.If you are an obsessive-compulsive sort who insists on trying to notice whether your UPS is working, the electronic display on the front is handy.Advice to prospective purchasers: buy more capacity than you think you need. Remember that these devices are intended to protect you from reasonable worst case conditions. So use reasonable worst case conditions for deciding what capacity you need."
3,Rather short battery life,"Noticed in one of the battery replacement comments (looks to be a rbc48) that UPS batteries have a fairly short lifetime these days. And low and behold, I bought this unit (SUA750) new in Oct 2008, and now the battery is in need of replacement as of last night (May 2010). Used for the ancient telephone answering machine and an iMac, once in a while plug in a disk drive or some such thing for very brief periods of time. Fairly light duty. Power outages every once in a while (a few times a year), but don't recall any long ones (over a couple hours long) since owning this, and tend to turn it off after a bit if the power takes a while to come back on. So just a little bit over a year and a half and it needs a new battery. Rather disappointing."
4,Solid and Reliable,"This is the second APC unit that I own. It is heavy, solidly built, and reliable. Highly recommended."
4,Pivotal to ALL Social Sciences students (not only History)!,"This compilation of essays and speeches treats the post world wars view on history. But it goes beyond history into empistomology, mathmatics and all social sciences (specially sociology and economy). From the point of view of a historian writing about historiography he touches subjects such as sinchrony, cronology, time, the role of history in social sciences, science of the communications, etc. Although I didn't always agree with the author in his historical determinism and the long duration of proccesses, his views certainly are pivotal to all social sciences since he recycles the marxists ideas such as that <<men make history... but history also makes man>>. It is also an important atgument to realize that <<political history>> and <<historical biographies>> are worthless to understand society now a days. Structuralism at its peak!"
3,These run tiny,"When I first pulled the pants out of the box, I though they were little kids pants. I usually wear a 6 or 8, and if these came in 16 I dont think they would fit. Quality is decent for $4, too bad they don't fit."
3,Unpleasant surprise.,"I have to admit that I was disappointed with the album. I had heard his album, Drab Zeen, and immediately considered it one of my favorites. I bought this CD with similiar expectations, but the two are quite different. This is an older album and I feel he was still developing as an artist. I do recommend it, but it is not close to the caliber of Drab Zeen. I hope this helps."
4,Recommend,"These covers have held up quite well. I've had them in the car over 2 years now. My car seats are black velour and everything shows up on them. These covers do the trick to protect the seats.The only drawback, or what you should be aware of, is that if you have side curtain airbags, the seat covers would block them, so you will need to make a slit of some kind over the location of the airbag.Altogether, reasonably priced, attractive and good quality. I've even gotten compliments on them."
5,Wedding Kids,This video is terrific! My neice (our flower girl) loved it. She practiced with the video and did a great job at our wedding. Now I give this video as a bridal shower gift to all my engaged friends.
2,Won't Change The World,"Catchy metal, but still metal. Tend to start their songs as decent rock tunes and then suddenly break into heavy metal lameness."
2,For die hard fans only,"I would only recommend picking this up if you are a die hard fan of there's. Personally, I wasn't impressed. Yes, it had a couple funny moments but besides that it was pretty boring. Also the re-watchability is very low. I watched it once and that was enough for me. Maybe in a year or two I will give it another watch but no time soon. So if you big fans of there's and want to support what they do, I guess pick it up and make your own judgement on it but otherwise I would recommend staying away. It's not really any different than there around the town videos (which you can watch anytime on youtube) besides the fact that they go across the country. Also I picked this up for $7.99, I have noticed the price changes quite a bit. Anyways I would give it 2.5 stars if possible."
2,Meh... spoilers.,"I enjoy the Around the town videos on there YouTube page. But this was not that great! A few parts were good but that was it. And I thought the whole fake prank stuff was so lame, trying to be like Jackass and failing big time.They could have talked about making those B-Movies or perhaps talk about funny things about their family or friends. Basically give it some heart and soul to it. And maybe adding titles, credits, music, etc. Seems like the only thing they put effort in to was the cover art.So glad I only rented it. Couldn't imagine paying full price for it."
5,"The ""Best Movie"" to watch!!",This movie shows no disappointment to who are bigs fans of Shawn C. Phillips and M.J. Kelly! 5/5 cool movie of 2010
5,Too bad they just didn't release The Jazz Sides on Cd,"This is nice, but doesn't really compare to the LP release--The Jazz Sides, Emarcy label, 1954-1958, after that, she went pop to make a living, sure can't blame her."
3,Much bigger than a butter dish!,"This is big enough to be a covered cheese plate. Also, the handle is very fragile considering the weight of the cover."
5,Jews for Jazz,"There may be nothing new under the sun, but there are more things under heaven and earth than any of us have dreamt of. And here's one of them, a brand new interpretation of historic Jewish prayer music, jazzed up in the best sense of that word. Chevan, Byrd, and the gang are master musicians and adept at the delicate welding operation required to fuse these two musical traditions into sound that is a rare pleasure to listen to. Meditative, uplifting, surprising, and never ordinary."
5,Great Movie,This movie was great! It was nice how it showed scenes of the psassing of time. I loved It. I usually like action or science fiction movies but this movie was one of the all time greatest movies ever made!
5,One of my favorite movies,Such an inspirational movie!!!! Definitely one of my favorite movies of all time. Richard Dreyfus is superb as Dr. Holland in this movie. Every musician & teacher should watch this movie.
5,Mr. Holland's Opus,This is my favorite movie. The quality was excellent and so glad that we can watch it and own it.
5,ethanski@y,"A great, great movie about: teaching, [great] music, being patient and dedicated to something you believe in, being a father, a husband, and a caring person. I took a dozen good friends and relatives to see it with me! Treat yourself to feeling good and watch it."
2,mediocre film,"First, the good thing about this movie: I think that it has called to people's attention the great dedication that many music teachers have for their work. It also may have raised people's consciousnesses about the lack of funding and support for public school music programs. There are some funny and touching moments in this issue.And then the bad: It's Hollywood, and it's cheesy. All of us who have struggled with a musical instrument know that you don't really get THAT MUCH better by ""playing the sunset."" The good-bye concert for Mr. Holland is also cheesy, as is the idea of a lovely young high school student falling in love with old Richard Dreyfuss."
2,Fail.,"The good: some of the acting.The bad: everything else. Especially the titular musical work. Hordes of composition students could've hit this one out of the park, and would've done it for free, but instead they paid gobs of cash to Michael Kamen, who decided to suck. Seriously, the ""Opus"" he wrote as Mr. Holland's proxy, should have come in a white can w/ black letters reading ""music."" In other words, generic as can be. If I spent my whole life working on that piece of trash, like Holland supposedly did, I'd stab myself in the eye with my conductor's baton."
2,"Sappy, Vapid, and a Little Creepy","OK, let's see. Mr. Holland is a neglectful, sullen, and resentful father, who diminishes his son because of his deafness, and neglects his wife in favor of his obsession with completing his decidedly mediocre ""opus."" He also develops an inappropriate relationship with a female student; while there may not have been physical contact, he also obsesses on her, and actually entertains the idea of running off to New York with her. Later, forced out of teaching (maybe due to his attitude problem?) his alumni all gather for a tribute concert, where the opus is revealed in all of its unfortunate banality. Sorry, this one just wasn't for me."
1,"VHS looked new, but didn't play the movie at all!","I need to know how i can return this purchase, although I purchased it cheap, i am willing to let go of the hassle to ship it back. I needed the movie for a class homework, ended up accessing it via utube instead. vhs was not playing at all inspite of the fact that it looked brand new."
5,Learning from your students,The teacher learns from his students and his family. A goal is finally achieved and others acknowlege his talents. Follow the course of history as this teacher deals with current events in his life and learns that being a father is more than providing the income.
5,"Exellent movie, humor, sorrow, and anger",This is one of the most touching movies I've seen in a long while. I am confused that it didn't seem to make it well at the box office. I guess the good ones often that. i cried at the movie and I never cry. It also reminded me of my husband who is just starting to teach
1,Mind numbingly dull!,This movie is just like To Sir With Love except they added an orchestra and took away characters or a story you could care about. It espoused a rather elitist view of the importance of music vis a vis other high school curriculum. A previous reviewer who described it as maudlin got it right on the nose.
1,Not worth my time,"I do not like this movie. It is stupid, sappy, and predictible. The main character is a jerk. He is ugly. I dislike his glasses. He almost cheats on his very faithful and beautiful wife with a random pretty student. That is just wrong. He never writes music, ignores his son, and hates you in particular. You should not see this movie. It will make you laugh, it will make you cry, it will make you angry inside. I am glad he lost his job. I would've made him lose more than that, the maniac. Poor son. He should strike off and do his own movie about his evil childhood with a negligent father. Okay. I'm done."
5,one of the best!,"For any music lover this movie is a real treat. I have been someone who has been inspired by my music teacher so this movie really hits home. It's a beautiful, tear jerking movie done to absolute perfection."
5,A movie you can watch 1000 times,"I first saw this movie when I was about 10 and I still watch it all of the time! The reason I got this was for a new teacher to inspire him, but there are so many good things about this movie. The best part about it is that ten people can watch it and get ten different ideas of what the movie was about."
5,A Great Classic Movie,"I originally saw this movie in the late 1990's and knew that I must see it again. This is a fantastic story of the life of an individual who was passionate about music, and the more important things in life and lifestyle. Extremely enjoyable, beautifully acted, and a movie I know I will enjoy over and over again."
5,Flash back time !!,I liked this movie cause of the flash back in time from the 60's to the 90's I like the movie because Mr Holland tried to teach the kid to enjoy music !
4,Better than average inspirational-teacher movie,The Bottom Line:Mr. Holland's Opus is a decent inspirational-teacher film that wisely eschews the traditional staples of the genre to focus instead on crafting a portrait of the character of Mr. Holland himself; the film sometimes feels too loosely constructed and too long for its own good but all things considered it's not a bad piece of moviemaking.3/4
5,Movie,Mr. Holland's Opus is a very educational movie and i am glad that i own it so that my kids can see it like i did when i was litte
4,Great film but not so great DVD,I love `Mr. Holland's Opus' but I really am less than pleased with the DVD itself. I recommend seeing this movie to anyone but it deserves a remasterd DVD / Blu-Ray release. So please re-release this great movie as it should be.
1,What an awful film...,"I had high hopes for this film based purely on my admiration of Richard Dreyfuss as an actor. What a disappointment. Dreyfuss is fine (though I don't think he deserved the Oscar nomination). The movie is treacle of the worst kind. I don't mind being manipulated by a film, but when that manipulation is so obvious, I just can't get past it. The harder they try to make me cry, the harder I resist. (Don't think I'm unfeeling; I bawled my eyes out at ""Terms Of Endearment"", ""The Elephant Man"" and many others). The whole subplot of the deaf son was unnecessary and there only to ""tug at your heartstrings"". Yuck. To make matters worse, Mr. Holland's ""Opus"" is awful and any true musician will tell you this. It's really bad. So's the movie."
2,Soft Music Movie,I hated this movie but there were some parts that were ok my mom loved this movie she likes soft movies. So if you dont like action movies than you will love this movie
1,A heart warming tale?,"Vicious stereotyping by a film that didn't seem to think it was yanking the heartstrings enough, they had to make his kid deaf as well. What a sick, pathetic oscar ploy from a washed up actor way past his prime. If you like schlock, or are into gimmicky, syrup-ridden tripe, then you will love Mr. Holland's Opus."
2,An Opus It's Not,"Like so many movies of the ""feel-good"" variety, Mr. Holland's Opus is little more than a magic carpet ride of top ten hits. It vague condescension fools you into long sobs, but your better sense tells you they're all just crocodile tears. It's the Bad News Bears with a backbeat."
5,Swiss Family Robinson it's not,"I am a voracious reader and can honestly say I have never read anything quite like this book before. It throws a little punch at you on just about every page. It is written in a cocky, sharply humorous narrative that keeps you snorting and turning the page. It will make you laugh, contemplate life, relationships, and running water (and all those other things we take for granted). Dan's adventures (and misadventures) will make you cringe, reflect and laugh out loud."
4,Have you ever wished you could...?,"Ever wonder what it would be like to drop evertything and live on a wilderness island? Ever wish you could take a year off and emerse yourself in ocean storms, home baked rye bread, and family fun with trying to stay clean? How would you collect enough fresh water and stay warm? What would you do if you encountered a football field sized moss bog or a washed up whale? What would it be like to find yourself bathed in acid while using the ferocity of a mid-night gale to charge your power supply? Daniel Hays wanted to ""live in the moment""; in a series of ""nows"". He shares every aspect of his experience with us and it is compelling reading. He has many insights and turns to his background in literature, psychology, spirituality, and adventure to find meaning. I looked forward to each day he described, laughed a lot, and got a glimpse of a way of life I would like to experience someday. Mr. Hays never meant to leave Whale Island...what would you do?"
5,The greatest get-away!,"After reading Mr. Hay's first book I thought that he couldn't possibly have another adventure up his sleeve worthy of a second tale. He proved me wrong, however, and has created a wonderfully poinant, entertaining tale of he and his family's adventures on this tiny spec in the Atlantic. In doing so he has once and for all proven that he is an acomplished storyteller, worth putting everything else on hold for. Bravo!"
4,One Up for Whale Island--and Dan Hays,"A splendid boook splendidly written giving full voice to his misogony but managing, all the whlie, to expatiate on his love of wife and stepson and nature including its vicissitudes--especially its vicissitudes."
3,"A well written story, but....","Hays writes an engaging story but I don't think I'd want to know the guy. The book tends to pitch a back-to-nature lifestyle but that's not really what they experienced. It was more like a vacation. Although the effort to maintain shelter took plenty of time and energy, apparently most food and all the clothing came from the store. The vacation ended, like many do, when the money ran out. There's not enough economic activity ---hunting, fishing, farming, weaving, writing or whatever, to sustain the family.He's pretty much self-absorbed. Does he care about other people except as they impact him? I'm always a little offended when someone begins any statement with ""A man believes, needs, thinks, etc."" The world is full of people with ideas good and bad. Those opinions are not determined by gender nor is their validity."
1,Not so good,"The concept of living on a deserted island is a wonderful one. However the author describes the experience in language that only a teenage boy, full of sex hormones, could possibly enjoy. It is written by a Prozac deprived guy who lives for a year in close to filthy conditions, and describes the experience in way to graphic language. This book left a lot to be desired."
3,A little disappointed,I have to admit since these were written so long ago I thought they would be really good stories. I was looking for something to share with children during story time in church but was somewhat disappointed with this book.
3,Disappointed,"I was disappointed with this deck, especially after having read all the rave reviews... I did not think the illustrations beautiful as some of the other users did... Although I could see a lot of effort went into creating this set.. I have other Tarot sets, and I just could not get into this one..."
2,missing so many key songs,"""Beautiful Girls"" is one of my all time favourite movie. One of the many reasons why this is so is because of the classic songs found in the movie. So needless to say I wanted the soundtrack. I was so disappointed, as many of the songs featured in the movie are missing, including ""I Run (So Far Away)"" by the Flock of Seagulls, ""Locomotive Breath"" by Jethro Tull, ""Fool To Cry"" by the Rolling Stones, and others. Not a very good selection."
3,Here is the review you were looking for,"Approx 80% of you are here for the same reason I came here....to find the name of that darn catchy song played in this movie, but is NOT on the soundtrack. Well, I did find out what it was, and am now enjoying it with great abandon ;-) The song you are all looking for...they don't write em like that anymore...is actually called ""The Breakup Song"" and is by Greg Kihn...you remember him....our loves in jeopardy...baby...oooooo..ooooo...hehe.The soundtrack itself is ok...but not as good as I hoped it would be.Enjoy"
1,Disappointing,"This is one of my all-time favorite movies; unfortunately, most of the best songs in the movie aren't on the soundtrack. After seeing how weak the sountrack was, my husband and I spent our money on the songs we really wanted from iTunes (they aren't all available) and made a playlist. Take my advice, buy the movie, don't buy the soundtrack."
3,Good stuff.,"This film really hit home for me, as it's set in New England and I can relate in a few ways. I got this soundtrack cheap used, and it's worth it just for the Pete Droge song. Kinda the main song of the movie I'd say. Ex-Fine Young Canibal singer Roland Gift has a great opening song. Two tracks from the Afghan Whigs which is fine with me as they're one of the most underrated bands ever. Chris Isaak adds a good tune from his Forever Blue album. Two of the most memorable songs ""Sweet Caroline"" and ""Beth"" are both here. Toss in oddballs Ween and a few oldies and it's a nice set. There's a list on wikipedia of some missing songs if you're tracking one down. Now...what was Rosie O'Donnell doing in a movie called Beautiful Girls?"
5,Cliched soundtrack that clicked,"Good set of music for a beautiful movie. What I remember most in this movie is how Uma Thurman adores listening to Van Morrison. How come no single Morrison song was included? Watch the movie and see how Natalie Portman, as young as she was then, almost stole the whole movie. And listen to this soundtrack, enjoy."
5,This Really Works,"Girl Get Your Money Straight could change your life. If you are always in debt, never seem to be able to get ahead or are just confused by financial matters you need to put this book on your reading list.Kimberley Lindsay Wilson, author of Work It! The Black Woman's Guide to Success at Work."
5,Right On The Money!!!!!!,This book was written by a woman that has lived the experience that she writes about. This book is worth it's weight in gold. Please do not hesitate to buy.
5,Girl.....get it straight!!,"This book is just the beginnning for all women of color. I think at times we may fall under the ""that's not me."" But get it together so we can pass it on to the next generations."
4,"Good book, good information","I just started reading this book, and I have found it to be tremendously informative. I have already sent an email out to many friends and family members recommending they purchase the book. I have one issue relating to recommendations in the book. The author insists that if you are in a financial bind and bills are not being paid, you should readjust your contribution to the church, specifically re-think your tithe. That I do not agree with, and I think some people that are having an issue with the tithe would use this recommendation from the author as a crutch to not tithe. The tithe is God's 10%, it does not belong to you to pay off a bill or ""catch up"". Outside of that issue, I am enjoying the book so far."
4,"Girl, Get Your Money Straight: A Sister's Guide to Healing Your Bank Account and Funding Your Dreams in 7 Simple Steps",Very encouraging and informative.
5,In One Word...Fabulous!!!,"This book is absolutely fabulous!! I have been reading it with hopes of getting my financial life in order. Sistergirl Glinda has really helped me along my way. She gives scenarios for the many different people that she has counseled which you can relate to and get a grasp on what could be your financial downfall. Just reading this book, encouraged me to start balancing my checkbook regularly and investing money, no matter how small an amount, in myself and my family. For all women, the book is a must have. I already have people in line to read it when I am done. Now I need to get the workbook. Great job, Glinda!!!"
4,Finally!,"I found something that is realistic and concise. As a single parent, she touched on issues that I didn't factor into the equation like all the extracurricular activities my daughter is involved. By looking at the attitudes of other family members, this gave me great insight to almost more than I wanted to know, but definately needed to realize. What I like most about this book, it brings it close to home for any sister who's serious about ""getting her money straight!"" I've set my goals, made my affirmations, and looking forward to removing items from my ""outstanding debt"" and doing away with it for good! I am debt free! Whew!"
5,This book speaks the truth!!!,Check the book out at the library and I know you will be back here to buy it!! The book talks directly to black women and what we go through on a daily basis! I wish I had it a fews years ago!!
4,not a bad read. lots of good ideas.,i enjoyed this book a lot. i just spend the past five years clearing my debt of over 10k and i ordered this book after i dropped it all down to zero. so i would've enjoyed this book moreso if i'd read it BEFORE i got my money straight. but most of what she said in the book confirmed what i'd done on my own so it was nice to see it all in writing. i'd reccommend it to anyone in debt problem as a starting point.
4,This is a WAKE UP CALL !,After reading the first few chapter I could relate to how my poor spending habits were inherited from my family. This book is a wake up call for not only the sisters but women who have dealt with debt and have a poor finanical future. Glinda Thank you
3,So boring!,"I know this book is suppose to be great! The history part is putting me to sleep. I thought about skipping that part, but may get confused later. So I laid the book down for awhile. Sorry!"
5,Awesome!,"I love this book because Glinda's writing style and information make me feel so comfortable. I feel as if I'm sitting at the kitchen table sharing with a knowledgeable sisterfriend, who understands what I'm going through from her actual experience. It's also good to know I'm not really going through this alone. The exercises help prepare me for the recommendations that follow. So I'm on the ""same page"" with Glinda as I move forward to getting a clean bill of financial health. This is also a good book for young women to use to build a healthy lifestyle around finances before they run into problems as well. I am so impressed, I've already purchased the other 2 books Glinda has written!"
5,I reccomend this book without reservation.,"""The Magistrates"" by Peter Smith is a wonderful read.He mixes a good story line with technical legal material in a way that makes the legal material understandable and also part of the fast paced plot.He captures the style that made ex policeman Joseph Wambaugh so popular as a writer.I reccomend this book without reservation."
2,Classic Hollywood end,"While Death Note is one of the most amazing stories the suspense and war between Mello, Near and Kira reach an impresive climax I must say I was quite dissapointed by the end of what happened to be an excellent series... I'd love to see the alternate endings made in Japan which unfortunately none of them were finished."
3,Replacement items.,Purchased carafe at Amazon because stores did not have correct size. Delivery was faster than expected. Carafe was wrong size. My fault. Return was fast and easy Would try again with different product.
1,Very poor design,"If I wasn't forced to get this carafe due to having to work with our Grind 'n Brew system, I wouldn't get it. It is cheaply made. I bought two in July of 2009. We do use the coffee make almost daily, but I already had to throw out one of them. The top cover portion that covers the spout broke off within the first two monthes, but that's not that big of a deal. It leaked around the rim where the black plastic meets the glass almost immediately. This was really only an issue for pouring the water into the coffee maker, but a very big inconvenience. Finally the handle cracked and broke. It's supposed to be designed to handle hot liquids, but clearly it is not a durable product. I wonder how many people may have received scalds due to this joke of a product. Luckily, we've known it's faults and have known to be very careful.My 2nd carafe, which I began using about six weeks ago is already starting to leak around the rim again. I do not recommend any coffee maker that uses this carafe."
3,Cuisinart Carafe,The plastic hinge on the lid of the Cuisinart replacement carafe broke within a couple of weeks. The lid still works; it is not as secure as it was/we would like it be. Overall this product is currently able to do the job of pouring hot coffee in the morning.
3,Not Strong enough...,"My husband and I are from Seattle, where we take our coffee very seriously. This product proved to be tempting with it's built in grinder/timer (the fresher the grind the better cup of coffee). However, we have found this feature to be sub-par, as the grind isn't adjustable, and it tends to be too large, therefore not emitting enough of the coffee flavor. We have just bypassed the whole grinding option, and gone back to grinding our own...and now the carafe just broke! Buy something else."
2,Poorly-designed carafe and lid,"This is my third time replacing this carafe because the nibs that hold the ""flapper"" in place on the lid become brittle over time and break off. This is the last time! If the new design of their coffee maker is not better, I'm changing to another brand of coffee maker next time."
4,Looks better !,"First things first: I ordered this product from Amazon.com thursday evening and I received it next Monday! Super fast delivery ! Excellent for Amazon : 5 Stars + ). This replacement carafe looks a better quality than the one that came originally with the coffee maker. I think that Cuisinart should revise these because I believe a lot of people have this type of coffee maker---which is very good---, but the problem seem to be the carafe : Very easy to break down."
4,Coffee Carafe,This replacement Carafe works better than the original that came with the coffee maker as it does not dribble as much when you are pouring.
3,another replacement,"We love the grind and brew machine but wish this carafe featured a better-designed spout/flap mechanism. We have had several of these and each time the clear plastic flap breaks off with seemingly normal use. I'll admit, this still leaves behind a fully functional carafe but with the addition of two slightly aggravated coffee drinkers."
5,Exact replacment,Not much to say here...it is an exact replacement at a much better price (even with shipping) than you will find anywhere else. Saved us from buying an entirely new coffee maker.
2,"Pours well, but is otherwise is poorly constructed","I actually used the original carafe that came with the machine for about 4 years before needing a new one - and honestly, I'm surprised that it didn't break sooner. The hinge-type part that keeps the lid on is a tiny little plastic part that snapped one day, so I ordered a new one. (Which, for $18 is a TOTAL rip-off.) I was really annoyed, when, about a month later, the tip of the lid (that hinges as you pour) broke off. I am exasperated by this carafe, and am on the look-out for a new coffee-maker so I don't have to waste any more money on replacing this one!"
5,carafe was same as originial,"Good replacement for the original. I broke it by putting it in the dishwasher to clean... wash by hand only! Other than that, good purchase."
1,Terrible,The carafe cracked on the coffee-maker's hotplate the second time I used it. I basically spent $25 for one good pot of coffee. It actually was cheaper to just go buy a new coffee maker - but not this type.
2,Carafe breaks easily,"We had to replace this carafe twice because it broke during hand washing in a porcelain sink. It was handled carefully, but it doesn't take much to break it. Replacing it is too expensive ($18+shipping) so we're moving on to a unit with a stainless steel carafe."
2,Not So Hot,"While we love our Cuisinart Grind & Brew Coffee maker we are disappointed in the ""flimsy"" plastic top. The pins have broken on 2 carafes and it becomes dificult for the coffee maker to brew ""into"" the carafe. In talking with others who have the Cuisinart Grind & Brew we have found this to be a common problem. We are staying with the Cuisinart Grind & Brew line, but we are placing our order for the ""new"" Stainless model."
2,Carafe Needs Improvement,"We have had the Cuisinart grind and brew coffee maker for many years. However, the carafe has been replaced 4 times. Either the nibs that hold the lid on break off or the plastic handle itself breaks and/or comes apart. After 1 or 2 times, this gets frustrating -- it seems to be a systemic problem with the carafe design. But, what do you do if you aren't willing to yet abandon the coffee maker and get another model? You're stuck buying multiple carafe replacements over time."
3,Does not fit all Cuisinart 10-cup machines,"I'm sure it's a fine carafe, but be aware that it doesn't fit every Cuisinart 10-cup machines. It didn't fit my Grind & Brew DCC-690, and probably wouldn't fit any Cuisinart coffee maker with a design like theCuisinart DGB500BK Grind and Brew, Black. It appears to fit a design like theCuisinart DGB-300BK Automatic Grind and Brew 10-Cup Coffeemaker, Blacknicely. If your 10-cup carafe appears to be a little taller than the picture and has a metal band around the bottom, it doesn't look like this product is a useable replacement."
2,Needs a re-design,"I've purchased four of these replacement carafes. With the exception of the carafe that came with the coffee maker, damage appears within weeks of use. The tangs that hold the spill guard break first, then the handle breaks near the top. There doesn't appear to be any noticeable difference in this ""wear and tear"" between hand-washing and dish-washer cycling. Tested pure hand-washing on the first two and dishwasher cycling on second pair. It appears to be either a design flaw or just flat-out crappy plastic (the carafe is made in China after-all).The carafe is cheaper than buying a new coffee maker, so we keep buying them. We love the grind-n-brew coffee maker, even after 7 years of use."
2,KRUPS is KING,"Considering all the bells and whistles on the coffeemaker itself,(all excessive, by the way) the carafes have much to be desired. It seems as if they are made with spun sugar. EXTREMELY FRAGILE, awkward handle and like a comment already listed, I too have replaced the carafe twice...making three so far. My Krups carafe of 10 years is still intact. If they still made the filters, I would still be using that machine.The Cuisinart coffee bean container is hard to clean, still maintains rancid oils and leaves an oil slick on the top of the coffee. The carafe is poor at best."
4,Better than the original,"I purchased this item after I broke the original. I always hated how you had to pour water slowly into the coffeemaker because the water would spill from the mouth of the carafe. No such problem with this replacement- I would recommend it. Normally I would buy a new pot but this one was expensive, so the seemingly high price of the carafe was worth it to me."
1,I don't like this model!,"Bought two at local store. The first one was defective (band was broken in box). On the second, the band only lasted about 40 shots. Obviously, quality control is an issue. I did replace the bands and they have broken yet--about 500 more shots.Since buying this slingshot, I have tried 2 others--the Daisy B52 and a TruMark with fiber optic sights. This one, the P51 Daisy, is my least favorite. There's something about the pull and it being adjustable that I can't pinpoint and I've tried it adjusted medium, shortest, and longest, that just isn't as powerful as the other two.Just an FYI--for long range I really like the band that TruMark uses (even though I don't use the sights) and for close range, I like the B52 since it has more resistance. My dad has the same preferences."
3,Realistic Review,"Looks great,Easy to use.Well constructed.I like the slider to fit different sizes.Bands seem to be lasting thru a few hundred shots.When I think of a slingshot,I think of knocking out a giant.Not with this one though,I bought 1/2"" glass and 3/8"" steel shot to test with at different ranges.They say ""Hight velocity"" I don't think so.Paintballs hurt more then these when they hit you.Shooting at 5 yards at empty Coke cans with either 1/2"" or 3/8"" just knocks them off.Some times you get a good dent.I was thinking more like going thru them would be cool,Disappointing performance.Overall It's a nice ""Toy"" even though it can be dangerous (Shots ricochet back a lot.Eye protection a must). i would of defidently given more stars if it would of punched a hole in a few cans..."
2,Daisy Powerline P51,"Like many of the other reviews on this page, I had the same problem. Within 15 minutes of use, the rubber tubing snapped and it was rendered worthless. I'm looking into surgical tubing from the hospital to replace it, because, after reading the other reviews, I don't trust the Daisy tubing to be worth a s**t. If that doesn't work, I will search for a product from another company"
3,It's an OK slingshot,"My father bought this slingshot for me. I was thrilled. It worked great for a day or two. Then the band snapped off. So I got another band and some glass marbles to shoot with. The band snapped off in about 15 minutes. I went through about six bands that wouldn't stay on the slingshot for more than an hour. Overall, I don't know if it's the bands or the slingshot that was causing the problem, but I do know that I'm already searching for a better quality slingshot."
1,Junk!,I got this for my son for Christmas. It got very favorable reviews here and was described as a professional model. After < 30 minutes use the rubber strap has broken and the web is ready to break as well. It's cheaply made and I am asking the Daisy company for a refund. I wouldn't purchase this product again.I wouldn't recommend it. I am now wondering if the product was endorsed on Amazon by the Daisy company employees just move their product.
5,Box of Cremes,I've always been a huge fan of Buddha Bar-esque (hip trendy bar/pub/restaurant in Paris) music and Les Bains definitely takes the cake! Disc One is a fabulous compilation of the best remixes and remakes of a range of musical styles from R&B to Bossa Nova to Latin jazz. My fav? Cada Vez. Disc Two boasts smooth acid and ambient grooves which are perfect for those lounge lizard nights. One of the pricier discs but worth every cent!
5,A great Cd for the Fashionable and the Chic,"To get a real taste of what the Paris elite listen to when they are relaxing in thier cafes on the Champs-Elysees, pick up this CD. This CD is based on the music of what might be the most trendy club in Paris, and since most of us can't hop a jet to France every weekend to be there, this CD is definetley the next best thing. It's a varied collection of songs, but David Guetta and Chris mix 'em well. I couldn't live without this CD, it's excellent, pick it up, it's well worth it!!"
1,Extremely poor quality product,"Beautiful watch and exactly what I wanted as gift for my ex-Marine father on his 50th anniversary of leaving the Corps. He loved it....for a few weeks, until it stopped working while resting on the dresser. Jeweler confirmed battery operational, but action faulty and completely stopped. Contacted seller and found that the watch only carries a 30 day warranty--pretty hard to believe for a $50 watch, but I gues it must have been in the fine print somewhere. Certainly would not purchase one of these again--would be better much off with a $10 Rolex from a Times Square vender; those watches typically last for a couple of months."
5,Don't let the title fool you.,"I ran across this movie on cable and was pleasantly surprised. The plot is a little loose and out of the ordinary, but it kept me interested the whole way through. Russell Crowe is his usual talented self, as well as Bridget Fonda. The two have good chemistry with each other, which helps make this far out plot seem not so far out. It even ends with a little morality to ponder over. Definately a feel good movie if you're looking for it."
4,Not Rough At All,"I recently purchased this amusing movie. As a big Russell Crowe fan he has yet to disappoint me in anything he is involved in. The scenery in this flick was beautiful. The chemistry between Fonda and Crowe was magical. I loved the old cars, clothes and the dog. These two thespians are great comedians as well as actors. Just sit back and enjoy the movie, don't look for anything deeper. This is a movie I will watch over and over again."
2,"Cliche ridden, predictable and dull","As a huge Russell Crowe fan I was particularly disappointed by this offering. No character in this movie was completely developed and bits of the plot were left hanging. A little explanation on a few points would have gone a long way toward developing even a single character in this confusing melodrama. As it stands Bridget Fonda spews 40's era cliches and tries to look alluring, while Russell Crowe (who can usually pull off a decent American accent) sounds ridiculous and seems to fall in love with Fonda's character for no reason whatsoever. Even the music is cliche. Sad, not one of the better vehicles for either star."
4,Not Your Usual Movie,"Not your usual movie - and the acting talents of Bridget Fonda and Russel Crowe contribute quite a bit to the unusual characters they play. She can turn someone into a pig and he is a private investigator that gets caught up in her magic. Of course Russel has his charm and charisma that works her over throughout the movie. He's arrogant and determined, but also warm and devoted. Bridget plays a woman in control - but doesn't realize she needs all the help she can get. She's an adorable mate for Russel's character."
4,Why I taped this movie.,"I taped this movie for one reason: Russell Crowe. Not only can he act, he's my age & he's gorgeous. Bridget Fonda, yet another waste of time actress. I guess the talent in the Fonda family stopped with Jane."
3,Quirky fun,"As an adventure/romance, this works pretty well. The grasping, oily politico after Myra's (Bridget Fonda's) body is easy to dislike. Crowe's character, the one sent to find her after she runs, is easy to like. The magic stays low-key, except for a few laugh-worthy moments (""Sausage!""). Parts of it don't hold together the way I'd like to see, but it's more than passable as commodity entertainment.So, why would anyone go out of their way? For my taste, it's Fonda's performance. Her character, tough as nails but with perfect nails, channels Lauren Bacall at her sultry best - not a straight imitation, but clearly an homage.There are better movies around, but there are lots worse, too. Fonda's performance really makes this worth watching.-- wiredweird"
2,Worth a look only for Crowe,Crowe fans may enjoy his scenes in this very odd flick which misfires quite a bit in an attempt to blend magic realism (?) with a love story and chase scenes. That's all I can say.
3,An off the wall movie,Very creative storyline. Filmed in Mexico. Mr. Crowe plays his part well. Ms. Fonda does okay for her. Not one of my favorites and not one I'd rewatch often. Definitely worth a look though.
2,2 1/2 ******,"I've tried 3 times to give this movie a chance to get it's point across. It doesn't. As in most films Russell Crowe is in, he gives his all, but the story is pretty convoluted and doesn't give you much to care about. It gets pretty stupid towards the end. We kind of understood the owl showing up but never could understand the green lizard. The saving grace is the scene between Alec and Myra in the church and of course, somehow, Russell winds up dancing with his leading lady, something that happened in several of his earlier films. In the beginning of the film Russell and Bridget are very Bogart & Bacall and the banter flows pretty well, even if we have heard it before. If you have the need to see Mr. Crowe there are better films to choose from.(...)"
4,Decent postcards,These postcards printed very well on my HP Ink Jet printer. They were easy to separate and address and mail. My only problem was that I couldn't get a template easily that worked with my version of Microsoft Publisher. I simply arranged two postcards on an 8 1/2 x 11 page so that they printed in the correct location on the postcard sheets (I measured where the perforation lines were) and that worked just as well as using a template. They were quite easy to snap apart from the sheet without any cutting and the edges were fairly clean.
1,No envelopes with this!,"Beware! Ad says they have envelopes and there were none!!! I was completely disappointed with this order. Also, the cards were very difficult to line up to print."
1,Didn't work for me,"For whatever reason, these sheets did not feed consistently through my printer. If I made a test print on regular paper, the label printed in the right spot. But when using this product, the label would not print in the correct spot, top to bottom, and would vary considerably in position from one page to another. It was impossible to make an acceptable print. I had much better success just using a word processor and 3 x 5 or 4 x 6 cards. They printed up great. This product, however, did not work for me."
2,Its not too good but theres only 1 label company that makes this,"I'm studying for my nclex exam and i thought it would be a good idea to make notecards for all my diseases, drugs & treatments....so I purchased about 6 sets of these... they re pretty expensive but its not like i had a choice ($22.00/each) they are medium weight so they feel like real index cards you get at a stationary store. The only thing is that it is hard to align each card....everytime you print it comes out different it sometimes over the line and sometimes way under...So what I did was I had to make one word document for each index card page. So I had like 200 word documents where i only used the first page of...(makes sense?) i know it sounds onfusing but it was a perfect alignment then. So to summarize: only the first page of word document you enter info into will align your notecard perfect!"
1,Nothing aligns,"After countless tries and numerous copies made in grayscale to save ink, I give up on ever getting these postcards to align right! I tried creating the postcard in the Avery website, in Publisher, in Excel and in Word.................nothing works. You can adjust and adjust and adjust and it still comes out crooked or misaligned. Waste of money and a big waste of time. Hire them done!"
5,I really liked this book,I had a lot of fun reading this book. It was really exciting to see all of the magical adventures that the author's thought of. I highly reccommend this to anyone who looks for a good time with a story!!!!!
5,The BEST WWII flight sim!!!,"DO NOT, I Repeat, Do Not pay any attention to the reviewers that said this game [is bad] or doesn't work! This IS the best WWII flight sim. I have WWII fighters, CFS I&II, European Air wars, and many others. This beats them all. More Authentic, Larger battles, great graphics, and many more perks. Not only can you fly the Spitfire, Hurricane, ME 110, and ME 109, but you can fly the Ju87 Stuka and be a gunner on the other German Bombers.The ONLY thing that could have been a little better is the sound, but the sound is fine and better than most sims. If you have not already, BUY THIS GAME! You WILL NOT be sorry!"
1,Waste of money!,"I can't even review the game, because I never could get it to work properly on my computer. Even after receiving tech help. My mistake is not checking these reviews before purchasing."
3,No Good,"This game (like my title) is No Good.. there are just so many other flight simulation games that this one is just like the otherz only u need a REALLY good computer just to run it... yes it has stunning detail and many planes,but if u dunt have the machine to run it... itz No Good... If u do happen to own a pentium 4 with a ge force 3 then this game might be worth it... but... overall therez other flight sim games simular to this one and this one is just No Good"
2,What a Shame,"This is a game with tremendous potential, the graphical detail of the planes is wonderfully realised and there is an excellent campaigns section, but in my view the good news ends there.The manual is poorly laid out and has no index.Following an enemy in flight is all but impossible, I tried for over 6 hours and never got on the tail of a bandit !!It is very, very tough on the beginner.I regularly fly Microsoft Flight Sims, pass this one by and go for Microsoft Combat Flight Simulator 2.Sorry Rowan, back to the drawing board with the bandit tracking and cockpit features.Give the beginners a break and get an index in that manual.I am expressing my own opinions here, but I have a fair degree of experience with Flight Sims."
1,Battle not to crash,What a waste of my time and money. I should have read other reveiws on this prodect before buying it. The game crashes all the time - everytime. The only thing I can say good about it is I got a jewel case and a pretty box. If there is anyone interested in this game give my a buzz.
2,A tad shy of brilliancy.....,"This game has classic written all over it - *IF* it is fixed. When properly functioning (which it does for me), the game is stunning and one of the best looking games I have ever played.Animated white caps on the oceans, London, and huge clouds of planes make this an immersive epic of unparalleled proportions.Unfortunantly, there are numerous issues with installation - and more with the campaign and computer AI. It is obvious that that Empire took what Rowan had at the time and dumped it on the public.Tech support is non-existant and there is no word of a patch to take care of all the issues. In other words, it's a crying foul shame that a game this brilliant is left to rot..."
2,This Game Needs Work STAT!,"I find this game too long to load simulations, does not have enough flexibilty when planning and launching German Air Raids and also crashes after each simulation ends. This game was not tested enough before release. Although the graphics are excellent, I cannot stand the constant simulation crashes, I am very disappointed with this game."
2,Super War Game for Super Players,"Got started this week after buying a joystick-thought it would make gaming easier. Have found BOB to have great potential, but poor printed instructions that just don't tell you ""what to do""....Got a lot of ""flying"" concepts- but no help whatsoever on hjow to land, what to do omnce you get a plane in the sky--and nothiong about how you keep it there! Same complaint about a lot of adult games. They assume you know the recipes and the sequences to follow....A fortune will be made by someone who translates BOB into down to earth lingo for us smart grown-ups who cannot figure it all out."
2,No super computer? No play...,"I am going to be selling back this game, or I guess just selling it used immediately, and I bought it this afternoon. I am running a 500 mhz P3, and even on the lowest settings (akin to the original gameboy) I can barely run it. The 366mhz suggested minimum is bull. Very disappointing game. Even when I did play it slowly on much higher detail settings, vastly disappointing.I regret this purchase. Waste of my time."
1,Crash and Burn,If you purchase this product you better wear a helmet! I never got this program off the ground. It crashes before any action happens. Talonsoft has a list of upgrades and patches for this program and none of them worked. Unless you can afford to reconfigure your computer specifically for this game I highly recommend not purchasing it.
1,Worthless junk!,"This software is the biggest piece of junk I've ever seen. The tech support is non-existent. You have to manipulate your computer and the software code just to get this to run. Then you start to encounter all sorts of other problems. I've got a fast computer with a good video card, lots of RAM, latest soundcard and this game creates nothing but havoc! You'll get more enjoyment from making paper airplanes out of your twenty dollar bills and tossing them off a tall building."
1,Rowan's Battle of Britain,This title sucks big time. I can not get it to let me fly the planes. It's looking for some kind of a dll. file. bob.dll or something like that. It should not have to be rocket science to make these games work right. I gave it to a frind at work and he could not get it to work on his pc.
1,a big pain,This sim causes many system problems and their teck. support is a joke. I have the most up to date system available in the market. What a pain!
1,DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT,I wish I had read these reviews before buying it. Its a mess. So many bugs its unplayable. I have the latest 1Gb machine with 64Mb video etc etc and its still hopeless. Longest run is about 2 minutes before it crashes. Save your cash.
3,Not perfect.....,The unit and bowls are good quality material. The only problem I am having is adjusting the height. Sometimes it holds and sometimes it doesn't. The price here is competative however compared to other sources.
3,old dog,I bought this for an old dog with back problems and bad teeth. She makes less of a mess with the higher bowls so i am very satisfied. If it is doing anything for her back its hard to tell but it doesn't hurt
3,Store n Feed,"It is a great storage place, but only holds about 15# of food. Don't really like the fact that you have to clean 2 things, the dish and the holder."
2,Poor quality,"I got this bowl for my lab and thought it would be great to store her food and help her not bend so low. Well, when I stored her food, somehow water can get into the container so her food got wet and moldy. Another bad thing was the stainless steel, ""rust proof"" bowl did just that....RUSTED! I had to replace the bowl. Also, the water bowl gets condensation on it and if food happens to fall inbetween the bowl and the container it molds. I was not happy with this product."
3,Store N Feed,"I have one like this and one that doesn't have storage underneath. I bought them for my weim and standard poodle. They work, but underneath the bowls water and food will collect and it gets absolutely disgusting. I tried everything to keep water from going underneath, but to no avail. They are sitting in my garage now, and I am purchasing elevated bowls without something to catch water under the bowls."
5,Couldn't be happier,"Very pleased with this product, perfect height for my rottweiler mix.He still manages to make a mess but he seems to eat/drink more.Storage is great, don't see how water can get inside."
2,not good for taller dog,"our last feeder was bamboo after storing food inside it grew mold in the bottomdecided to try the plastic this timehowever, upon opening was dissappointed that you can't remove the bowl and reach in to get food it has a solid top and the entire thing has to be removed to get to the food very inconveintent with water in the bowl - decided to keep anyway my hubby said he would just cut his own hole ... so we started using it at the high setting bc we have a tall dog and as he eats most of the time one side drops down! not stable -( and he's not an aggressive eater) therefore would not recommend for tall dogs - only medium to small"
3,Not What I Was Looking For,"I thoroughly researched adjustable feeding bowls for my dog. This bowl's description led me to believe it had a range from 8"" - 12"" However, the options are 8"" or 12"" inches. 8"" is too low and 12"" is too high. Therefor, I had to get creative and put it at my desired height between the two using screws to hold it in place. Wish I had bought a different product."
4,Glimpses From The Edge Is Worth The Journey,"I really enjoyed this Glimpses From The Edge. It was a fast reading jopurney through the life of Dan Bruder and many of his adventures and mishaps. I liked the fact that it was 24 short stories that were really varied in both subject and mood. As an example he speaks about witnessing race riots as a little boy in one story which is very emotional, and racous adventures with his high schiool buddies in the next which is hilarious. It was not particularly polished, but more like someone telling you a tale from their youth. He was careful not to mention too many celebs that he interacted with by their names (which was classy), but the reader can easily conclude who he is talking about. I give this book 4 stars instead of 5 only due to the fact that it could have been longer. But I recommend it."
5,Made me cry N' Made me laugh,"Bruder life is certainly worth laughing about at some points and crying about at others. He is a honest writer who is committed to portraying his life's landscape in NJ with as much subjective, minute detail as a classic painter would attempt. He is, for the most part, quite successful in his attempts and I applaud his efforts."
3,Almost fantastic,"Fantastic Frank Strozier is not far from... beeing just that. In post sense. It's a good recording session with a great rhythm section, and the two new interesting horns by Strozier and trumpetist Booker Little. Recorded in 1959-60, Strozier is clearly a youngster on his way into the style of the sixties. He's not Ornette Coleman and he's not Phil Woods. If we must, there's more Jackie McLean to him, but i think that Strozier sounds ""merrier"", not so wining. The star of the CD, is doubtlessly Booker Little. It mightbe that this is one of the best recordings i've heard with him."
5,Made camera protection for Nikon D80,"It makes the camera a little bulky, but you get a better grip. It was an excellent choise buying this protection for my Nikon D80."
2,Doesnt quite fit,I own a Nikon D80 with the 18-200mm DX VR NIKKOR len. The protected armor for the body fits but the lens hood will not fit on a 72mm diameter lens. So I ended using only the body and cannot use the lens hood. Now my camera looks like it came a circus.
3,good protection to your camera,"This armor will definitely provide protection, but is very uncomfortable. I would recommend it in extreme adventures such as hiking or camping."
3,Could be Better,"I purchased this item with the idea that it might lessen the damage to my camera in a fall as advertised. The product might do that if it fell a few inches, but the thin neoprene does not seem like it will protect the camera from anything more than bumps and scratches. Furthermore, the controls are covered and the single color body armor makes it very difficult to read the control button information that is molded into the neoprene. I would suggest white out to highlight the raised type on the body armor. Oh, just forget the lens protection it is a piece of junk that flowers off the end of the lens and does absolutely nothing more than look foolish."
2,Limited form and functionality,"Pros:1. Provides a better grip on the D-80 camera body.2. Provides some superficial protection against minor bumps and scratches, but useless if the camera is dropped.Cons:1. The body armor limits accessibility to some of the controls and the diopter adjust is completely blocked.2. The rubber body armor material is a magnet for dust and lint. The material needs to be treated with automotive interior sealant (applied with micro-fiber towels) to eliminate the static problem. This will add an additional $20-$25 to your overall cost.3. The body armor kit includes a plastic LCD screen cover, but it's the same as the one provided in the standard D80 kit.4. The body armor adds additional bulk making it impossible to fit into the Nikon D80 camera bags.5. The body armor lens hood is a practical joke and should not be included with the package."
4,dust magnet,"This item fits remarkably well. I can operate all of the buttons on the D80 through the armor. It also improves one's ability to grip the camera, although the camera is already of a size that makes it hard to lose one's grip. My only complaints are (1) the rubber seems to attract dust with static electricity (can blow or wipe it off the uncovered camera body, but not the rubber armor), and (2) the piece that fits on the end of the lens is visible on the periphery of the pictures I shoot and at the 18 mm end of my 18-200mm zoom lens (unless I fold it back) and makes it hard to remove and replace the lens cap. I don't use the lens part of the armor for this reason, which is not a huge problem but enough to subtract a star from my rating."
2,Camera Armor for Nikon,"If you absolutely know every control on your camera then this product will provide excellent protection. However, if you need to see which button is which, don't use this product. There are embossed labels on the rubber, but, being the same color they are very difficult to read, even in strong sunlight. I would only recommend this product for those people who never have to look for a particular control. Then again, if you are such a person you probably don't damage too many cameras so you wouldn't need this product."
5,EXCELLENT for what it was designed to do,"This product is to provide protection against the myriad accidental small bumps the camera of a physically active photographer receives. It's place is use in industry, construction, surveying, insurance adjustors, investigators and other such professionals whose duty requires them to be in crapmed, cluttered, or congested locations; or in physically awhward positions, where the use of both hands to move about safely may be required.It is not for drop protection. that is the duty of the neck strap.It is NOT for protecting a camera against novices or irresponsibility.That ugly lens protector does it's job well. The filter threads are a fragile area. A high quality UV filter helps too. I recommend using both.Remember, this product is an adjunct to careful camera use. Nothing will protect your camera against incompetence or apathy."
4,Nikon D80 Armor,"I received the product in a very good and well padded box. Packaging was very well done. I only took about 5 min to fit the Armour onto my D80. The Armour for the Lens was not as easy as I thought it would be.With my added on camera handstrap and the Armour, it made my camera handling more comfortable (being a guy with larger hands). All sockets and connections were still as easily accessible as without the Armour.The only two down sides with the Armour was it attracts dust onto it and that the on and off button was a little hindered (difficult only when turning off).As I travel often for overseas shoot (often in rural areas which are dusty and rough), the Armour gives me more confidence with camera safety."
4,Generally a good product,"Generally this product works as intended. Some trimming could be necessary for specific ports to open easily, but I did not find that a signficant problem. Does help with maintaining a grip on the camera and while it won't save a camera from signficant drops, it does provide decent protection against scratches and small bumps.Con - the addtitionl gripping power works against you if using one of the smaller camera cases."
5,A must if you are very active with your camera!!!,"This is my SLR camera #8. I have purchased tons of cases and backpacks and bags to protect my valuable assets. But once I pull the camera out of the protective case: nothing protects it if you are not paying full attention! I can't, I am very active with my kids and friends, I can't be taking care of the camera as if it was made of glass! This 'rubber armor' is the perfect solution to avoid nicks and scratches that go beyond that sometimes. I don't use bags anymore. I just use the armor with a hand holder strap and I am set! This is an awesome invention: if you love your camera, get it!"
5,A Taste For Revenge,Hey books don't get much better than this. I really liked Jax she was no simpering miss. And Ian Mordoor was no slouch either. I enjoyed their story so much.
4,"Holy Cow, This Book is Awesome!","I am partial to science fiction as far as books that i read to enjoy, but this book was very entertaining and suspenseful. For first part of the book, the book being divided into three parts, i was curious to see if Michael would pass the exam to become a Certified Master Chef. The second part of the book is very interesting, because the chef is working in the actual restaurant business. Later in the book, the third section, Michael goes to this awesome restaurant in California to visit the chef, which is one of the best chefs in the world. If you are a chef or ever want to be a chef, or are just interested in the process of becoming a chef then this book is for you."
1,Possibly the worst writing style I've ever encountered,"THe only saving grace of this book is the subject matter....which I must say, is fascinating enough to have kept my attention from cover to cover. But this author's style, grammar, and flow is so difficult to read that on several occaisions I considered throwing the book away. He should DEFINITELY stick to cooking, and leave the writing to the professionals. I recommend finding another book about food to keep you entertained."
2,Why?,"I have previously responded to the Feedback invitation from the actual product shipper. Your system should in those cases be asking me for a duplicate version. if you want one, you know where to fine it. I consider my valuable time wasted by what I am doing right now. Also, I rated this 4 starts but your system shows as 2 stars. YOU may want to not publish this review."
4,An Entertaining and Interesting Read,"Ruhlman gives wonderful insight into the makings of a top tier chef and explains his point of view by approaching the subject from 3 perspectives - Technical Excellence via the discussion of the CMC exam; Passion/Personality through the coverage of a new wunderkind chef in Cleveland (perhaps the most enjoyable part of this book); and, Philosophy in the discussion of the remarkable chef at the French Laundry in California (fascinating, but the weakest section of book.)I probably should have read his earlier book first, as I would probably have become more familiar with some of the kitchen terminology with which I was unfamiliar. Nonetheless, in addition to explaining his view on chefs, Ruhlman provides a terrific window on this unique world."
4,For Fortunate Foodies. . .,"Michael Ruhlman has a key to the secret lives and passions of some of the world's greatest chefs. This tripartite work lets the reader into the lives of several chefs, some inspired and some not so inspired. Although of passing interest, the middle part could be left out and the book would probably be improved. The book culminates with Ruhlman's long standing relationship with Chef Thomas Keller, owner and chef of The French Laundry during the time that he was writing Chef Keller's two cookbooks. Recommended reading for any serious foodie or anyone ITB.(...)"
4,"Michael, get a better editor!","This is a light, quick read for anyone who likes food.My only criticism is that Ruhlman's wonderful voice is sorely in need of a better editor. The errors detract from the storytelling. Other than that, it's a lovely read."
4,"tastes good, but cuts could have been more consistent.","I found that there was a tension between (1) telling a story about chefs and (2) the author's own story about how he had changed after attending CIA. I thought that this caused a lack of clarity that I found in Kitchen Confidential. Admittedly, a completely different style, but I think that the point is that Kitchen Confidential had a focused theme. This was a bit of a mixed bag and the presentation clashed. It lacked the precision that I thought should have been present. But it tastes good. The stories are well written and kept me turning pages. So, a 4 out of 5."
4,Three ways to be a chef,"This fun read has three parts: part one looks at chefs taking the Certified Master Chef test at the CIA (a 10 day marathon), part two looks at hot young chef at LOLA, a hip Cleveland restaurant, and part three examines Thomas Keller, the chef at the French Laundry, one of the country's elite restaurants. By the end, you see that the CIA represents technique, LOLA represents a restaurant driven by the chef's personality, and the French Landry represents the ultimate marriage of the two. While the author at times over dramatizes certain events and points, the book picks up power and makes some interesting points about being a chef, while also being a lot of fun to read. I recommend this book if you are interested in cooking or restaurants."
4,"Three parts, most of it fun","This book is divided into three portions. The first is the most exciting and involves the C.I.A. and its bizarre CMC exam. The second is the place I'd like to visit, Lola's in Cleveland. Makes the life of a chef appear to be fun for all, guests too. The final part about the French Laundry made me shudder entirely too often. The book has problems in that this quest to answer ""What makes a great chef?"" does not automatically sew these parts together. Overall, a very enjoyable read though..."
1,Why is the kindle version more expensive?,"I'd love to read this book. I've read Ruhlman's other work and enjoyed his writing. However, I refuse to purchase it because the Kindle version more expensive than the physical book. Why is this when there is nothing to print, ship, or store?"
4,Great Indoor Antenna for DTV Converter Box,"I have two Optima TV antennas connected to DTV converter boxes in my house. They have been performing very well in receiving HD signals from TV stations. After the digital conversion, I got several more channels, all with great pictures and audio. The antenna is very good in receiving both VHF and UHF channels. The only minor drawback is the signal strength for each channel may vary significantly when the antenna orientation is fixed. Of course you can pay more for a smart antenna to eliminate this problem. All in all, they work great!"
2,Awful,"Purchased this hoping to have a nice alternative to paying to cable. I live in the middle of a large city and I could not get a single clear signal in my apartment complex. I was going to get a silver sensor, but the salesman recommended this instead. Why did I go against my gut?Been fiddling with it for a while now. And I have yet to get a good signal from any channel. Will return."
1,disappointed,"www.type has a nice cover... we all know the rest. it has a few good examples of websites, a whole lot of what not to do and not much else. i really think that richard pring was more interested in slandering bad sites than collecting good ones. the book also contains quite a few badly executed 'eyecandy style' images 'designed' to demonstrate best practice. all in all it's a badly designed design book... a true 'design book for the blind'."
1,"Uninspiring and sad, not true tantra","I have respect for Kali and things that are inherently here to change or destroy so that truth can be reborn (or protected)....but this story never gave me that feeling. The entire time I was reading it I felt a strange negative undertone ...as if I wasn't being told the whole truth. I always felt Preema was lying - no matter how many reasonable justifications she gave for herself...it felt incredibly manipulative and heartless. I do admit the book itself was interesting to read and almost exciting at points, but the end left me feeling disgusted...not enlightened or even educated. I felt sorry for the author and question his clarity...because his final act seemed more like annihilation & assimilation than a destruction done for the purpose of love & protection."
5,great book,"This is a classic book on mysticism. It is a lively true story of the author intertwined with a wealth of mystical knowledge. For the first time a benevolent soul has revealed this profound secret knowledge in a way the common man like me can understand. Aunt Preema's discourses to the little boy Shambu clarified a lot of my questions about the human mind, relationships, universe, God, astral beings, other worlds, rituals, true love, evolution, sorcery, shamanism, karma and rebirth, lust and guilt, etc.After reading this book, I have a major paradigm shift and also a feeling of my heart opening up for life and love. My heartfelt thanks to the author for publishing such an enlightening, healing and a lively book. I highly recommend this book for people inclined towards mysticism and the study of the mysteries of the human mind and life; and off course for one's own self improvement and healing...."
5,Great collection,"I thoroughly enjoyed this album. Here are the track listings:1. Feliz Navidad (Jose Feliciano)2. Jingle Bells (instrumental)3. The Christmas Song4. The First Noel (instrumental)5. The Cherry Tree Carol6. The Little Drummer Boy7. White Christmas (instrumental)8. We Three Kings Of Orient Are (instrumental)9. Mary's Little Boy Child10. It Came Upon A Midnight Clear (instrumental)11. Silent Night12. Hark, the Herald Angels Sing (instrumental)"
3,If You Love Christmas Romances This One Is For You,"This movie completely exceeded my expectations. If you love modern Christmas romances, you will love this one. The movie really focuses on the battle of the sexes as it follows the he said/she said relationship and later romance of two newspaper columnists, all set against the background of the Christmas season in a semi-small town. If you remember Dina Meyer from Starship trooper, be prepared to see a different side of her as a softer less Soldier type of character. Mr. Sutcliffe still retains the same charm we all love as he portrayed Christopher in Gilmore Girls. In all, it was a ""make you fell good"" movie that should be in your collection...if you like this type of movie like I do."
3,Serial Murder,"The first sentence of Egger's 1984 doctoral dissertation should not be forgotten. He BEGAN with the idea of linkage blindness and continues to use it to this day. Yet Egger was in the midst of major multi-jurisdictional task forces (e.g. Lucas), regional information centers, expert team efforts (e.g.Brooks in Atlanta), and, Sam Houston hosted around 5 federal agencies planning VICAP. Where was the linkage blindness in all this horizontal networking? Talking is not the problem--or an answer. The word is victim linkage and early detection to achieve apprehension--police needed new solutions. What were the premises of ICAP, upon which VICAP was based? Why not develop new solutions--as we did in 1979? For 20 years, we've heard about ""linkage blindness"" and ""nothing is known."" If nothing is known, why write on this topic? People should start to demand more from so called experts."

5,GREAT!,It is readily apparent that - there was a great amount of time spent in organizing this book into an excellent format. The added benfit of all of the graphics and worksheets are very effective. It is a very creative approach. The organizational flow is really easy to work with. I think your concept of teaching is also unique.
5,Our Children! Our Future!,"In-Power! In-Love! In-Joy! is a brilliant contribution to our future. Children who have the good fortune to read and use this book will grow up with a real understanding of life and how it works. Learning these great truths so young means they don't have to unlearn untruths, bad habits, and deep self-worth issues. They will know who they are and where they are going. It excites me to think that these children will know now what I searched to learn as an adult. They will be our future leaders and will guide us into a new consciousness."
5,Keep this at Your Desk,"Never having written a review before, I was compelled to do so after reading Steve King's ""Catch A Falling Knife"". In this book, readers are treated to a clear, understandable discussion about the Web and how to use it advantageously for business success.The information given is consise and up-to-date, engulfing you in the incredible number of areas that the Web can affect your marketing strategies. It is not merely a ""How to"" but an extraordinarily insightful book to be used as a reference resource that will enable you to create a Web strategy that actually works."
1,Ugh!,"What was Trey thinking? This CD sounds like 10 very talented musicians all entered a studio ready to make a great jazz CD. Then for no apparent reason, they switched instruments and they all ended up with one which they had no idea how to play. The engineer pressed the record button, and all the musicians started blowing in the instruments they didn't know how to play. This CD is pitiful, it hurts to listen to it. Unless you're deaf or like music thats not so great, I wouldn't buy it."
1,Why?,"I am HUGE into music. I play it, I record it, and I listen to it avidly. I am aware of the fact that when the musicians got together to record this album there was an abundance of talent in the room. I looked at some names, mainly Phish's Trey Anastasio and Jon Fishman and said, ""Wow, this looks like it'll be a great experience."" Sixteen dollars later I was thoroughly dissapointed. Don't make my mistake."
3,This CD is on spinning on the edge,"When I first heard the story of this CD (Trey got a bunch of the best musicisans he could find put them in a studio and started the tape) my intrest was peaked. The first time I listend to it, I could tell that these peple had never been in the same room together. After a few times thru it I realized, these people are genuses. Sometimes its hard to listen to it so freeform, other times its beutiful because its so freeform. My favorite thing about `Surrender` is all the moving parts and hearing the instant chemestry between this dream team."
1,Skip this one...,"Comparing this album to Bitches Brew is like comparing the ABB's Live at the Fillmore East to Cheap Trick Live at Budokan. This album is an utter disappointment to both myself and every other fan of jazz/improv. music I know. Like the 'peon' below me I have been an avid listener to free jazz and jam music for many years and I just don't get this album. If you want to hear some real ""free jazz"" do not buy this album. Go out and get the album that started it all: ""Free jazz"" by Ornette Coleman..."
1,Unlistenable,"Is that even a word? It is now...and it can be applied to this album. I am a huge Phish fan as well as a fan of Trey's solo work. When I saw the artists on this CD, I thought how could it go wrong? And yet it did.I'm not a music afficiando, but for the average listener and even jam band fan, this is an endless cacophony of mangled and irritating sounds. Stay away."
2,The book is not good to learn,"Looking at its contents the book seems to be very adequate for introducing undergraduate students (in science or engineering) to topics such as sensors and electronic instrumentation. Unfortunately some topics, i.e. analog (?) amplifiers, are presented in an oversimplified and confusing way which leads students to get wrong concepts on them. Others, like signal classification (chapter 2) are quite arbitrary and lacking foundation. At worst the book has some severe errors, for example in chapter 1 page 9 , or the description of RTD senesors. I think the book needs a detailed revision in order to find other gross errors. With respect to topic presentation I think it is always possible to explain the right ideas without using neither complicated math nor basic semiconductor theory. Finally, for the professional the book does not add anything valuable. You get neither new concepts nor information."
2,meh.,"too boring for 7th graders. i got it to show to my class, but it is definitely more suited to an adult crowd. the narration is a little dated now, and it's a real snoozer."
3,Good... but maps not detailed enough for real-time help.,"The Pharos is easy to install & use, and has great satellite response. However, the maps are not as detailed or up-to-date as Garmin's MapSource Maps. I found the directions were sometimes strange and circuitous, leaving me to wonder where I went wrong. If you already know where you're going, the Pharos can help you plan the route. On the other hand, if you need real-time navigation help, try the Garmin cfQue instead. With over 5 million integrated points of interest, it's the best deal going."
3,A Navigator is only as good as his map,"I'll keep this short.The Pharos hardware is great; fast, accurate, flexible (CF, Bluetooth, cabled), compact.The Ostia software is great; easy to use (love the ""Home"" and ""Auto Re-route"" features), fast, intuitive (after reading the manual to understand the icons).The Map data... well that is a different story. It is old and inaccurate (missing highways and major streets that have been in place for 5+ years; and yes, I did download their ""latest"" maps via ""Smart Maps"").Bottom line, I do not trust their maps to get me to where I want to go in a city I do not know. I'll just use the Pharos hardware with Pocket Streets & Trips or Mapopolis.So my advice is to just by their hardware w/o Ostia and get another Navigation Application with reliable map data."
4,Great Navigation Tool for the money!,"If you allways get lost in the car, this is a Great Navigation Tool for the money! Specially if you allready own an Axim. If money is less than a problem, Garmin makes a PDA with navigation built in that is really great."
1,Erik Bryant - Can you please explain the install procedure,"Erik Bryant from Fremont, CA United States:I have the iGPS 360 and I have not been able to Get Signal to the PDA using the default Comm 1 port.Can you send me the instructions or the configurations of the ports (port number, protocol - NMEA/SRIF, and baud rate) please ?I would appreciate your help on this.My email id is pgopinathan@hotmail.comThanksGopi"
4,A super-dee-duper vacation,"Barney's Imagination Island will your children a quick trip to paradise.Tasha, Min, Derrick, Sean, BJ,and Baby Bop go on a adventure of sharing gives you new friends as we meet Mr. Tinkerpot.The songs are upbeat and make you want to get up and dance right along with your kids.Watch as the kids and Barney try to find a way back home as they go on a camera safari to see what they can see!"
2,Not my vision of reality for kids,"I understand that some kids like Barney. My 1 year old has been watching this video lately (I didn't buy it; it was given to us). But personally I can't stand Barney, and I think that good children's productions are also appealing to adults. The kids remind me of Stepford Kids and they are sooooo cheesy in how they are nice to each other. It is so fake. It gives the impression that real people aren't this way, which isn't the message I want to communicate about being polite!"
2,"The watch is durable, but the nice looks fade fast","I bought this as a low-cost diver's watch. The 200 m rating, easy-to-read display, and Velcro strap give it the versatility to wear on the boat, in the pool or scuba diving. I'm happy to report that the watch still works fine after six months of wear and a week of diving. But it looks as if it's ten years old. The decorative trim on the wrist strap started to crack and decompose after two or three hours in salt water. The finish on the grey plastic case has also started to chip. I haven't babied the watch, but I haven't abused it either (running across bricks or concrete, for example). I'm disappointed that a watch marketed for being rugged has proven to be such a wimp."
3,Purely Functional,"I ordered the Ironman first, then returned it because it looked like I got it from a quarter vending machine. Ended up getting a Nike Oregon Superwatch and am extremely happy with it."
1,"Boring, boring, boring",The Alibi ManNot her best book. Hard to get into the story. Seemed very long and boring. Would not recommend!
2,I have a question,"Shouldn't the five star rating be given to writers who last though decades, through eras?Sure, this book is fun. But five star?"
3,Slow moving story with an ending you can easily predict,Just okay - probably wouldn't recommend it. Story s part of a series on a former rich girl turned outcast based on her past as a cop. She was injured and disappears into the elite world of horses. A friend is murdered and she has to find the killer. Very predictable and it took me a long time to read it as it never held my attention.
4,Keeps You Guessing,I had never read anything by Tami Hoag and didn't really know what to expect. I was very pleasantly surprised by this book. It keeps you guessing right to the very end! S.L. Chessor-AuthorMy Tongue Fell Out
3,Enjoyable read,"This is the first Tami Hoag book that I have read. I did enjoy it even though I don't have an interest in the horse/polo world. The characters were interesting and she held my interest right through the end, which is something James Patterson has never been able to do. On the whole this is a great beach read!"
2,she can do better with her writing,a bit boring and slow --something too obvious and the leading caracter was always angry and irritating --was glad to finish
4,alibe man,I enjoyed the book very much. I'm a new Tami Hoag fan and will purchase more of her books. I really like her characters and the way the stories unfolds.
5,Elena Estes should def. have a series!,"One of the best books I've read in a long time. I received this book Friday and was finished by Sunday night. I could not put this book down, except for my Saturday night fun... Excellent Tami Hoag thriller."
2,Amazingly Bad,"Cashing in on the success of her last novel - Dark Horse, Hoag uses the same female lead character to weave a story that's, painfully slow and unnecessarily graphic in the gore department. Furthermore, it's hard to enjoy a book when one cannot like or respect its lead character. Elena Estes is a charmless, self-centered Eve Dallas wanna-be(In Death Series by JD Robb). Yet, unrealistically, several men seem to be attracted to her. The author repeatedly mentions how ""cynical"" Elena is, but has her sympathize and almost melt with sorrow for a psychotic killer. I found that a little sickening. But then again, perhaps it's not surprising that one psycho would have sympathy for another."
5,alibi man by Tami Hoag,"This is the second time I've submitted a review on this book. Please don't ask for a third one.If you like mysterys you will enjoy this book. I admit that some of the discriptions of the dead and dieing were pretty scary and disgusting, but they fit the story line. Tami Hoag is a greater writter and when I see her name on a book I always buy it. Enjoy."
4,Shades of the Past,"ALIBI MAN is my first book by Tami Hoag, but it will not be my last. Now I've got to read DARK HORSE. For a new reader the back story was smoothly woven into the fabric of the character Elena Estes. Ex-cop, ex-party girl, just about ex-everything has a definite sense of justice, which sends her hunting the killer of a stable mate.Each character was firmly drawn and the changing points of view were not obtrusive. A very good read.Writing as a Small BusinessSins of the Fathers: A Brewster County Novel"
5,the motown song!!!...,"just like the song says ,bring over some of your ole motown records,n'party down!!!!the temptations,the funk brothers,the miracles, the four tops,the jackson five,the spinners, the isley brothers,the elgins,the monitors, chris clark,kiki dee, kim weston,tammi terrell,mary wells,diana ross & the supremes,gladys knight & the pips, martha reeves & the vandellas,jr.walker & the all stars,bobby taylor, marvin gaye, rare earth,stoney n' meatloaf,r.dean taylor,xit{indian folk group on motown's rare earth label},the commodores,debarge,stevie wonder,brenda holloway,the marvelettes,the dazz band,boyz II men,on n' on!!j.h.god bless!!{berry gordy's empire}"
5,Escaping Tornado Season,"This book is exquisitely written. Telling the story in poems produces a demand on the author to make every word count. And Julie Williams delivers a spare, haunting, passionate tale about loss, injustice, tenderness, and forgiveness. The characters are complicated and not always likable yet the author treats them with compassion. She respects the difficult histories of her characters. Readers will experience a wide range of emotions in reading this incredible book--joy, sadness, anger. There are also moments of warm sweetness in the book, where the descriptive powers of the author give the 13 year old protagonist a touching, achingly beautiful voice."
4,Excellent intro to Lake Trout's sound,"Melding drum n' bass, soulful vocals,and psychedelic guitar leanings, along with a infectious flute and saxaphone line, Lake Trout brings their blend of live electronica to the masses. The band produces music that derives it's sound from dj sampling,big beat drumming,and ambient textures on mostly analog instruments. ""Alone at Last"" is a recording from Trax nightclub in Charlottesville, VA, that is over one year old. Lake Trout's music moves in leaps and bounds, so the sounds on ""Alone at Last"" are only a preview to what was and has come to being. The album is by far the best introduction to Lake Trout's sound, and is highly recommended."
3,repetive boring guitar lines impede the fun,"I have heard nothing of Lake Trout besides this CD, so my opinion of this CD is of a stand-alone work, not compared to anything else they may have done, studio or live. The drumming is awesome, laying down hard driving dance beats. Their music, especially guitar riffs, are repetitive and sound contrived and unnatural. There are some nice techno-beat jams laid down here. All in all, its pretty good stuff, but the claim written on their CD that they are ""saving the world from mediocre music"" is a bit overambitious."
3,Sequel not as good as original,"While I enjoy reading historical fiction, especially stories related to WWII, I was disappointed in the sequel compared to the original. It was an easy read that kept my interest, but it lacked any ""enthusiasm"" from the author that made me really get ""involved"" ithe story. I would have preferred to read an entire book related to the story of Stephen Deitrich than to read this lackluster thriller."
2,sloppy editing,"""The Raven Deception"" started off well, and I thought it would be an enthralling read. However, the further I read, the less compelling it became. The sloppy editing bothered me: basic German words were misspelled [""Fräulein"" was spelt ""Frauline"", the Tempelhof airport was spelt ""Templehoff"", ""Hauptmann"" was spelt ""hauptman"", etc.], and made me wonder about details. The end was unsatisfying, too many loose ends tied up too vaguely. By the time I finished I was dissatisfied with the book, and dissatisfied with myself for spending the time reading it."
1,Worst of the worst,"A deception indeed! I was deceived into purchasing this book and sorely regret the money ill-spent...Amateurish writing: in a Plot 101 class for freshmen, I'd mark this with a D minus."
5,Phone Call from God,I have been looking for Phone Call from God for awhile. I am so glad that I found it. Received in great condition and it got here quickly.
5,GREAT BOOK,"Finally a book about what I consider the best of the crop of young actresses to arrive in the past few years. The book only confirms what I've felt about Neve, that she truly is a good down to earth person. This book gives great insight into her casting on Party of Five and all the behind the scenes information on the Scream films.Give this book a try. A must for all Neve and Party of Five fans."
1,Incredibly poor drive!,"I tried two Sony DDU-1621 DVD-ROM drives, and both of them constantly disappear from Windows Explorer and Device Manager on a brand-new install of WindowsXPSP1 on an Intel D875PBZ mobo. Reboot, reboot, reboot... Then I read the reviews elsewhere, and you would nearly think that this was the worst drive ever made. The Sony storage support website has NO official firmware updates, either. I tried a new IDE ribbon cable, but that wasn't the answer. Yes, the drive is properly configured per the instructions on the Sony drive support website. I've read that Sony doesn't even make this drive; well, they shouldn't put their name on it, either, since it drags down their namebrand quality. Best thing about it? It's even quieter when it's dead!"
1,Doesn't like all DVD's ...,"Some of the dvd's I tried wouldn't work, or it would start spinning like crazy shortly into the DVD. Sometimes it made it beyond the menu, but not much into the movie. Trying again (rebooting, swapping DVD's, restarting programs, etc.) didn't work. However, the same DVD's it hated worked perfectly fine in a different desktop (its drive was a Lite-On)."
1,What a piece of crap!,"This DVD drive is truly a BIG piece of steaming crap. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY purchasing this DVD drive. The DVD drive only worked for about 6 months. Then, one day it started to disappear from Windows Explorer and decided to properly read Data CDs, DVDs, and Music CDs whenever it fricking felt like it (which was NOT that often). Sony...you're fired!!"
3,Still alive and...,"Made in GER in 2000, Serial# MTM-068124, Playing Time 56:23This is AXE's 8th album (counting their 2 previous albums of re-recorded material), and it follows in the band's tradition of melodic and fairly powerful rock.AXE has experienced very little success: this is probably due to the fact that they sound like many other bands, with basically nothing that sets them apart. I find it difficult to compare them to other bands because it's like a blend of MSG/PRETTY MAIDS/BLUE MURDER/FIREHOUSE/etc.The tracks were recorded with a ""live-in-the-studio"" approach, but still manages to have a somewhat polished sound. The addition of talented Danny Masters on guitars helps in filling some gaps that might have otherwise occurred.If you enjoy melodic but non-commercial rock, this CD is a good investment: not spectacular, but still a bit addictive..."
2,Must be a Reiki Master,"I was so excited to receive this book only to discover that ""each Reiki student should find the Master Teacher who resonates best with her philospoply and way of being in the world. ... If you have not learned Reiki, we hope this chapter has given you a starting point for talking with a prospective Reiki teachers about Reiki philosophy and practice.""This book lead me to believe that I could learn and practice Reiki on my pet. According to the back of the book, ""Whether you're a newcomber to the field of energy medicine, . . .""This book, I am sure is great for a Reiki master but it is not good for someome that does not know Reiki."
1,rip off,"This book's subtitle, ""Using energy to heal the animals in your life,"" is misleading. It suggests that you, the reader, will be given instructions to use reiki energy to heal your animal friends. The reality is the book tells stories of how the author has healed animals using reiki. In fact, she states that if you want to learn reiki yourself, you can reference the training centers in her index.This would all be wonderful if the book were entitled, ""Memoirs of Reiki Animal Healer"" but since it is not, I am taking my book back for a refund.Great animal pics. but otherwise a total rip off."
2,Ok,The book was a bit informative but informs you that you need to take a Reiki class to really understand how to perform it. I was hoping to get more from the book.
5,Love the book,This book is so helpful.. When I got my first attunement I wanted to learn everything I could about Reiki.. This book was a huge help..
3,Chris Sertzel,"This book is a little vague, but still delivers a lot of necessary info on Reiki and understanding energy work with pets."
2,Not the book to buy if you are looking to learn Reiki.,"I was disappointed in this book, since I was hoping it showed Reiki technique. I am sure it is a good book if you are already a Reiki practitioner, but if you are wanting to learn Reiki to help your pets, this book will not help you."
2,"This is not a ""how to"" book","This book is not what I was looking for. It's full of testimonials and ""gee-isn't-this-greats"", but it never tells you HOW to do the energy channeling. Or HOW to ask your animal if they want to receive Reiki. Evidently this is a super secret, double-dog skill and you need to find a Reiki Master to learn from. So it basically told me nothing, except that Reiki could help - which I already suspected before I bought the stupid book! I didn't need a book of testimonials.So if you want to learn HOW to do Reiki, this book is a waste of money. Either find a ""Reiki Master"", or a different book."
5,Animal Reiki: Using Energy to Heal the Animals in Your Life,What a great book. An easy read. Everything you need to know about healing animals. Truly recommended for healers of all levels.
2,Lack step by step guide,"Fill with lots of example,s,but can not find practical step by step guide. This book serves as a general guide rather than a practical operational guide, a story book."
3,A lost classic from the early days of Christian heavy metal!,"I've had the cassette for years, and recently got their Thrill seeker CD. Not musically the most original band. I put them along with Messiah Prophet in that sense. However, they came out during a time when metal bands proclaiming Christ were not as numerous as we have now. They were really good at guitar harmony leads and melodies. Like other Christian metal bands of their day they were very evangelistic."
3,Cute but Unbiblical,"Cute book and my 2 year old has liked it from the time she was around 1 year of age. The only thing I don't like, and it's quite a big issue, is it's theologically incorrect. It says ""Jesus was a child of God just like me."" He is a child of God and so are we if saved but not in the same way. I'd prefer that line to have been left out."
3,Sunset Park :Movie Soundtrack Cd.,"Cousin gave me this Cd way back, Don't remember seeing the movie, But I do Love putting the first song on the cd and the Best one on there ,over and over again. it's the only song worth listening to. Mobb Sleep /Pig and junior whopper mafia ain't worth listening. Good booty track on there as well Tha Doggpound."
2,"Good song selection, bad mixing","Though the song selection and the parade of artists is exceptional, the CD is mixed terribly. The bass is so overwhelming that everything else is simply washed out. On stereo systems with low wattage amps, this CD is unbearable.I guess it was in the interest of low-rider junkies with tricked out speaker systems that the CD makers decided to pump the bass past reason.Steer clear of this soundtrack."
4,It's what you should expect for the price.,"Good watch. Keeps time accurately. Does not have a ""glow in the dark"" face so keep that in mind. Feel of the watch is a bit on the light side, I would have like a bit more heft.It's a good, every-day watch - not an heirloom.Update - 3 months later - the glass fell out in my pocket. Normal use, in fact I was sitting down when it happened. Went to check the time and the glass fell out when I opened the case. For some reason I can't change the rating from 4 stars to 3 but that is how I rate it now."
1,Only one good track,"I heard the song Waterfalls (One Love Mix) by East To East on Pandora and loved it, had to buy the song. Waterfalls is the only track on the album worth listening to, the rest SUCK!"
2,K&N air intake filter fo r a Honda Ridgline,"I have only had this on now for about a month. It has increased preformance some, but the gas miliage is no better at all, maybe worse. And no, I don't have my foot in the gas heavy, if anything I'm a mild driver. If you are buying this for increased miliage, don't waste your money."
4,Good machine. Good prices,"I actually have some pretty major issues with some of the reviews here. Firstly, the price of these cartridges is quite cheap compared to other cartridges. And, because each color is in a separate cartridge you might not even have to purchase all of them at once. In terms of the user that complained that his cartridges were half emtpy, it wasn't an issue I had. If this really did happen he should have complained. In any event, these are all user opinions and side issues.The bottom line is that this is a well priced machine that is easy to install, has a good software suite and is simple to use. A simple reading of the user guides before starting could avoid a lot of hassle for people."
3,Only the printer is inexpensive...,"Well... I think I will go back to HPs after all. Epson makes GREAT scanners, and the printers have always been at least okay, if not good, but this CMYK printer is bankrupting us. The cartridges are small, and not cheap - and only sold individually. Ink usage is surprisingly even - so when one cartridge goes, get ready to unload $70 on all of them.But the quality is nice. Remember: this is a C M Y K printer (your monitor shows RGB) so the colors WILL look different from what you see on your screen. CMYK (Cyan, Magenta, Yellow, and Black) is used by offset printers (printing companies), but I have never got the hang of it - even after several books and catalogs. grr..."
1,May as well flushed my money down the toilet,"Printer came with 3 empty ink cartridges, and a full black so I couldn't even test it till I purchased more ink. It eats ink like crazy and doesn't print clear pictures at all. Cleaned nozzles, ink nearly gone again! What a joke, and waste of my money! I'll be doing better research before buying a DIFFERENT PRINTER than this junk!"
1,Do Not Buy!,"The ink level monitoring on this piece of junk is the worst!Poor speed, poor quality, horrible ink consumption...total waste!Please do not buy an Epson...they really really do not care about you.This is my second Epson, only because they replaced the first piece of garbage under warranty.I will never support Epson again."
2,Not worth your time or money,"Bought this a few years back and for the vast majority of it's life now, it's sat on my desk with empty cartridges. In a pinch this last winter I gave in and purchased $50 worth of new OEM high capacity cartridges however suddenly my jet nozzles became clogged (wasn't printing right) and had to do the cleaning process geez about 15 times before it finally cleaned itself up. Problem is, by the time it was clean, THE NEW CARTRIDGES WERE NEARLY EMPTY!!It has good scanning quality. :-P *sigh*Never again will I purchase another inkjet."
3,Just one thing urks me...,"The cheap execs at Epson couldn't include full print cartridges in the box. I'm not even sure if they were half full.It really chaps me that only after a couple of weeks of printing, I have to go out and buy full print cartridges."
1,"slow, uses ink very fast, and photos don't print at all","the ink did seem expensive, but i bought it because i thought i would be nice to have an all-in-one printer at home. i also expected it to print photos. so far, i have wrestled with it for two hours, and have only managed to fill three of my in-package photo papers with total gibberish. i am sorely disappointed. the package that said a maximum black and white printing of 22pm was lying. it prints 3 pages per minute. i haven't even checked the scanning capabilities yet, but i strongly recommend against the purchase of this item."
2,BEWARE: not worth the money!!!,"The print quality is bad with frequent stutters and blurs. It has poor compatibility with Adobe Photoshop on a Mac. And as many others have noted, it consumes a huge amount of ink! About the only good thing I can say about the Epson Stylus CX5000 is that the scan quality is good. Other than that, it's a complete waste of money."
4,"Great quality...but man, it's thirsty!","I bought the Epson CX5000 to replace my CX4600 which after two years of heavy use finally gave up the ghost. I used it mostly for documents but printed many high quality prints on photo paper as well. I'm pleased with the print quality of the new machine, but I thought something was wrong when my ink levels dropped more than 30% after only a week of limited use! I wondered whether the supplied cartridges were not completely full out of the box. Anyway I've seen that I'm not the only one with this issue, so I am putting my own two cents worth in. I hope Epson does something about the ink cartridge capacities so I'm not worried about frequent replacement. In the meantime I am not that happy because I have to be more conservative with my printing needs. Higher capacity cartridges won't solve the ink consumption issue, but at least I won't be hitting the store as much. Overall this all-in-one machine does it's job well, let's hope Epson upgrades its cartridges."
2,"The Epson Stylus Color CX5000 All In One Printer, Copier, Scanner","Makes, great copys, and is a decent scanner for the price. However, it EATS ink, even when you have a paper jam or ect. It is going to use ink, it really sucks at being a printer. The first one I got didn't even load paper, I had to mail it back.For the Price, its a good scanner/printer however, if all you need is a printer, get a real printer."
1,Avoid Epson!!,"This is the last Epson product i will ever buy! They have serious quality problems, poor designs, customer support is a joke! got this hunk of junk for my daughter, this thing didn't work right out the box... it would not load paper. Called customer support spent a hour on the phone with someone in India :-( who just knew how to read a script, she put me thru to second level support as soon as I told him I had a CX5000 he hung-up! Tried calling back with no luck!"
1,Epson CX 5000 is a guzzler,"I wish had read the reviews before I purchased this printer. I was looking for a printer, fax and scanner all in one. This seemed to meet all my needs, however, it uses ink like crazy. 30 pages for one black ink cartridge! Well I begrudgingly replaced the black cartridge and then very soon after two color cartridges went out - no biggie I said...I only print in black & white. Then the killer - this printer only prints if ALL cartridges have ink - even when printing in b&w forcing me to replace the color cartridges when I only need black & white. It's apparent that this was designed to use more ink and then again more ink. I would NOT recommend to anyone. The only saving grace for me is I got a deal at a garage sale."
2,The Ink Monster,"I bought the CX5000 3 weeks ago, printed ONE color pic and ink was out. Bought a new color bundle from an Ink Store INCOMPATIBLE! Seems Epson does not permit 3rd party ink. Over $60 for on line buy.Sorry I bought Epson . Even though black shows OK, will NOT print in B&W; either. Shame on Epson for marketing such a SHODDY product."
2,Drinks Ink!!,"The Good: The print quality is good and it is a good scanner. The 3-in-1 functions very well.The Bad: It quickly depletes the ink cartridges. Even though it has 4 different ink cartridges, you will be replacing them all about the same time and very often (less than 100 printed pages).The Ugly: The printer's manufacturer has sued to prevent any compatible ink cartridges from being sold for this printer. Therefore, you are stuck with having to buy name-brand ink. You will quickly exceed the cost of the printer with all of the ink you will be buying for this printer."
1,ink is a pain!,"I see several other people have had the same problem I am now experiencing. I obtained this printer after something went wrong with my CX4600 - Epson replaced it with this. I have never used the color printing after the initial installation when it cleans the print heads, yet somehow they are empty. I have checked to be sure there isn't an ink leak in the printer and found no evidence of such. Now that the color ink is dried up - or whatever the problem is - I can longer print. Even if I choose the black ink only option under settings, I still am not able to print until I go spend about $40 to replace the 3 color cartridges. I am unimpressed to say the least. I had a $25 Lexmark printer that worked 10X better than this pricier model."
3,A clinic in empty orchestration,"Jacob Druckman presents a number of problems to the listener. The surface of his orchestra pieces is extremely appealing. There are few composers of recent decades who have able to draw such color from an orchestra. He is an absolute master of orchestral effect--but to what end? I find that the more I listen, the less I hear. There's just not that much going on under the color.""Counterpoise"" is the strongest piece on the CD, due in no small part to the efforts of Dawn Upshaw. She is in fine voice and really manages to sell the songs. Like a fine actor (let's say Michael Caine), she can find interest in material that really doesn't have it."
5,A great find!!!!!,This was such an awesome find. I actually bought a second book and gave it to a friend. This book had so much incredible information about angels. I have been fascinated with angels since my youth. I have a huge library on angels and Gary Kinnaman book has been instrumental in my research. He gives an in-depth look into the existence of these celestial beings. I can never read this book enough. In fact everytime I pick it up I discover soemthing new.
4,Wore me out....,"This is probably one of the most over-the-top metal CD's I own. While I realize that Sigh are decade-plus veterans of the global black metal movement, I'm not sure how to treat this CD.The album has a very operatic feel, with several string/horn arrangements peppered throughout the proceedings. At times, the symphonic arrangements seem a bit overbearing, and just when I start to get annoyed with them, Sigh reels me back in with another litany of blast-beats and primal screams.My only real gripe with this album is some of the noise going on in the background (e.g.: horror clips, ghoulish cackling, etc). In fact, at times the bombast of the CD borders on campy, and I can't help but wonder if Sigh have traversed a line that turned them into a charicature instead of a true musical force with which to reckon.Maybe I need to listen to it a few more times."
1,"This book was not all that, I seen better",I think the book was bad. I read a lot and this I will not read again. I threw it away.
3,lol,you cant spell worth crap. shame that people pay for your writing. uneducated or if your educated you missed learning.
4,GRIPPING..HA HA,"That's the word they use to describe movies..right? I liked this book. It's an urban tradgey but I liked it. Most women encounter a Lou-Loc in their lifetime. They probably just choose not to date is ass. This was one of those ""i gotta get to the end"" books. I loved the plot and it kept me wanting more. I cried at the end (call me a sucker for love)but this was a good read. Triple crown did it again"
4,I Felt Like I Knew The Charecters Personnally,This was definately a good book. It started off a little slow (first five chapters or so) but quickly picked up. The charecters felt so real to me. The book had some typos but still read okay. It was a page turner. I got so emotionally involved that I actually cried a few times. Pick up this book. It won't be a waste of your time!
2,THIS ISNT HIS BEST WORK!,"I mean sure vickie gave him his start, but he could have done better. Vicki can teach him alot. Her novels have depth, and entice the reader, keeping them hungary page after page!"
4,Tell It Like It Is,"This was a very interesting novel. For those of us, who are not into the underground world of sex, drugs and street life, this book tells a facinating tale of that world. I really enjoyed the book."
2,A Terrible Read,"I was so disappointed in this book. I understand where Kwan was trying to go with the book, but the book should've been edited better before release. Sometimes it read like a book other times it read like a bad play."
2,Next,"First let me say that i am a HUGE K'WAN fan. I have all of his books and thoroughly enjoy them however Gangsta was for the birds. It was not well written and it did not flow well for me. It was slow and the whole gang connections were a little confusing and unnecessary for me. (I could've done wihout the whole bloodz and crips storyline) I also couldn't get with the way the book mentioned random people only to never talk about them again. I understand that this was his first book but I am glad that I didn't read this one before Hoodlum or Eve because I would have never bought another one of his books. However, I will say that K'wan has progressed as a writer and I am fan of his work (Gangsta excluded)."
3,I am left with questions?????,"Okay let me began by saying that the book was pretty good for the most part. I didn't see as many of the errors that the other reviewers said there was. But I saw a couple not enough to condemn the man to total damnation!!! But I am left with some questions....1.Who in the hell was cross?2.Why did he eat people?3.How did Gutter get cured?4.What did Cross give Lou-Loc when he asked him to give him something to help him want to kill or some mess like that.. and Cross was like you know that it was like a drug??!?!?!?!If anybody can answer these questions please do.. because maybe I was just lost and missed something. But I really think the book could of been longer. ""Eve"" is the best book that he has written thus far."
4,This book was o.k.,This book was o.k. The ending of the book was predictable .But overall this book was fine!
5,"A raptly engrossing, deftly woven tale","K'wan Foye's Gangsta: An Urban Tragedy is a suspenseful novel of Lou-loc, a skilled assassin of the Crip gang who tires of the street life and considers a better way to live his life. Lou-loc follows his aspiration of becoming a writer, while at the same time a ruthless sociopath gang buddy of his by the name of ""Gutter' is striving to become a king of crime with the gang culture. Threat of death is lurking close to hand for Lou-loc, and those who have lived by the gun are constantly under the gun's ominous shadow. Gangsta is a raptly engrossing, deftly woven tale which marks K'wan Foye as a writer of significant storytelling skill."
3,AN OK READ,"DON'T GET ME WRONG I ENJOYED THE BOOK. ACTUALLY READ IT IN 3 DAYS. HOWEVER I THINK THIS IS SUCH A LAME STORYLINE. GANGSTA WANTS OUT, MEETS A GOOD GIRL, AND THEN THE UNTHINKABLE. THIS IS A TYPICAL GANGSTER WHO WANTS ANYTHING OUT OF LIFE. I THINK OTHER CHARACTERS WERE A LITTLE MORE DEVELOPED THAN LOU & SATIN WERE, SUCH AS LOU'S BABY MAMA. THE ONLY THING LOU KNEW WAS TO DEFEND HIMSELF WHEN SITUATIONS GOT HEATED. ALTHOUGH WITH THAT SAID, IT WAS EXTREMELY HEARTBREAKING AS THE ENDING CAME UP. I WOULD RECOMMEND IT, BUT DON'T EXPECT ANY MIRACLES"
3,All Cried Out...,"I cried so hard at the end of this book i have no more tears left. Out of all honesty, this book wasn't written that, the characters were sketchy, and there was TOO MANY spelling errors, but the plot saved it. The plot is what keeps you turning and turning until the end. My favorite character was cross. I have never read a book with a charactre like his. Job well done."
3,It was cool,"It was a cool read, but sometimes i felt that lo loc's character was a a little bit to superman for me, i mean jumping on the hood of cars, and doing the things that he was doing. But overall, i enjoyed it. But the ending, I mean if Lo Loc's was smart, i think that he'd still be alive, i mean just because you say you're out the game, that don't mean your definitely out the game, he should have known better--you may think you're out, but other niggahs ain't gonna see it that way. I say he shoulda had his gat on him till he reached the airport, and then passed the gat to his man, until he made it on the plane safely."
5,Outstanding!!!,"It took you in a world of gangs and blood. But gave you a great character in Lou-loc he was smart,caring and ruthless due to his environment.. A great read keep up the good work K'Wan.."
4,a really good book!,when i first started the book i was like this is wack and even after i was done i was like it was ok. but then i sat down and read it again and me being from cali and moving to the east coast made me understand what they were talking about. in cali gangs are taken more seriously then on the east coast when i moved here looked at the gangs as a big joke and i still do sometimes cuz i see if the were to go to the west coast they would not be livin right now. so this is the type of book that you have to understand where the person is coming from.
4,Too Late,"Gangsta was a pretty good book. I just took a star away from the Cali way of talking, it was just a little too much for me, I ain't knocking it though.This story is about playing the game of the streets and paying the consequences. When you realize its wrong and you need to get out, you realize it a little too late.What I definitely liked about the story was how is showed the main character Lou-loc. He was very smart, but he fell prey to the streets and a dumb-a-- broad by the name of Martina, who was straight playing him out from the beginning, got pregnant from by the next man and the whole nine. She was one of the haters that initiated his downfall but she got hers in the end. Like the book says....ALL DEBTS PAID!!Later!!!!"
3,Real Gangsta!,"Reading Gangsta was like reliving my childhood!! I grew up around gangs in the 80's and the lingo, the action, and re-actions in Gangsta was dead-on. Lou-Loc was trying to get out of the life and walk the straight and narrow but all of his dirty deeds came back to haunt him. How could he expect to be a good husband and provider to Satin when he never gave the chance to so many of those he killed?"
3,Everybody wants to be KING,It has been a while since I read this book. I decided to review everything that I have ever read. For this novel to be Kwan's baby it was great and his growth is very evident. The grammatical errors and the typos were a bit irritating but it didn't take away from the story.From Cali to NY Lou-Loc and Gutter both have inspirations to be King. One wants to be a King of the ink pen while the other wants to take over the streets and take the throne as Kingpin. The plot is very intriguing and full of suspense. Kwan keeps it gangsta and I can't wait for the return of Gutter.
1,Blah,"This book reminded me of a very lame, teenage romance book. Pretty boring and predictable. Maid's daughter gets pregnant with mother's employer's rich son. He marries her, she loses the baby, she divorces him for money, they meet up years later, he falls in love with her again and they lived happily every after. The end. It finally had a sinister plot towards the end. I had to skip most of the book."
2,No description on how unit power is re-charged!,"Haven't bought yet, because there is no explanation on how the buyer will recharge the battery/power. Do I have to buy additional charging products, or would I have to plug it into a pc to be recharged?.. It needs to ship with its own charging unit, so one can charge while traveling in one's vehicle. Hope Buslink isn't too cheap to include a charging unit."
4,A Real Go-To Guide,"Having cruised the French Waterways for 4 summers on our own boat, we heartily recommend Hugh McKnight's guide. Without his recommendations, we would have missed our small pilgrimage to Vincent and Theo Van Gogh's graves and dozens of other sights that have made our cruises truly memorable. Even though our information packed copy is an older edition, we use it almost every day--must buy a new one!"
3,Hugh McKnight's authorship defiency,"I bought his book not only to have a reference to canal travel but to scope out costs of such travel. While there are several, not easily found cost references, I found no specific information leading to the unavoidable conclusion that the old adage, ""if you have to ask, you can't afford it"", applies. Which I resent. Mr. McKnight should re-write this book adding what the costs of entering each canal, what are the average costs of meals, wine, fuel, and comparisons of food among the various sources on that route. I am not an inexperienced traveler and always have some advance feeling for cost so that unplanned surprise costs are not faced. I can understand his reluctance to include costs, as so many change fairly rapidly, but relative costs should be an important part of all travel books."
3,"OK, not great","Although this was a good show, and is necessary for any completist, I was really disapointed with the video itself. It was taken from the Imag feed for the amphitheater. That is, they basically just recorded what was shown on the video screens at the show. So you have lots of close-ups, if that's what you like - but no crowd shots and very few full-stage shots. Given the quality of their other live videos, this one is very disappointing."
5,The best book available on Roman Republican Coinage.,"This book reviews the socioeconomic times and coinage of the Roman Republic. It provides valuable information relating to the identification and documentation (including pictures of the vast majority of known coin types) of coins of this period. If you are trying to identify an unknown coin, this would be the first and best pictorial source, and is also a scolarly work dedicated to showing the whole picture, from historical accounts to mintage figures and die types."
5,This CD has a both musicality and style!,"If I were stranded on an island, I'd have this CD with me. I love Jude's voice and the songs she has included on this CD really demostrate her range of talent. Besides the title cut, my favorites are ""Love for Sale"" for the clever lyrics and ""Mariscos"" for the sexy, Latin sound. If you enjoy jazz vocals, you won't be disappointed with this CD."
4,Very strong and durable,A very strong and durable backpack and serves you well. Lot of compartments. So you can also carry a couple of files and books along with your laptop.
1,Mira para otro lado.,"Para hacer corta lo que debería ser una larga reseña, este es un libro introductorio a las enseñanzas toltecas, y un pobre intento en el tema, no acabo de entender como DonMiguel endorsa estos libros, esta supuesta mujer ""Nagual"" muestra a lo largo del libro que esta llenita de su ego, veneno en contra de los hombre y que alguna relación que tuvoEn el pasado, nunca la sano completamente.Si esta interesado en aprender el camino tolteca, vaya a las fuentes, Carlos Castaneda, Miguel Ruiz y Theun Mares, no pierda su tiempo y dinero con estos farsantes.PSEspecíficamente, de la versión en español, que traducción tan horrible."
4,Heartfelt and touching.,"I got this CD a year ago, and on first play wasn't too impressed with it. Ms. Syms made this recording at the end of her career, and the years have taken a toll on her voice. Maybe because I'm a year older, and a lot closer to Social Security than to my high school graduation, I gave this production a second hearing from a fresh perspective. I now see it as the effort of a valiant woman in the twilight of her years putting every ounce of her being into facing the challenges and indignities of what remains of her life. This time through I find her music heartfelt and touching. And I feel very privileged that I have this disc in my collection. It leaves me with the impression that the world is a somewhat better place because of the music that Sylvia Syms left to it. Don't buy this CD because you want to hear a wonderful voice. Get it because it is one of those rare recordings that will make you feel you are in the company of a very special human being."
4,Fireworks as Worlds Collide,"When a legend in her decline hitches up with a cocktail pianist with ambitions to be a songwriter there are sure to be fireworks. John Meyer met Judy Garland one night and they became lovers. She sings his song (""I'd Like to Hate Myself in the Morning"") and he moves her into his parents' apartment. This is a cautionary tale of ""Hollywood home invasion"" that is a bittersweet companion peice to ""Me and Jezabel"" (Bette Davis) and ""Film Stars Don't Die in Liverpool"" (Gloria Grahame) which cast superstars as domestic pests. Sadly the last chapters descend into bathos and self pity when the songwriter comes down with the flu and the legend moves on to her next husband. Not for those Garland fans who won't hear a word against their idol."
1,HEARTBREAKER is a terrible book,"I have read almost all the biographies written about Judy Garland and would rank this the absolute worst. It could be subtitled ""I screwed Judy Garland and I want to tell the world."" The only earthly purpose this book possibly serves is to make the author feel like a celebrity and to wash his dirty linen in public. Even if everything he writes is true, he is barely a blip on the lifeline of Ms. Garland. It's not even well written."
3,Great while they lasted,They worked great for about a week. My dogs are pretty active and the caps ended up wearing all the way through. When I took off the few that didn't fall off on their own you could see right through them
4,size,"hi ¡¡i wanna now the size of the nails that i could buy for mi dog, my dog is a pug of 4 years, thanks for your attention"
3,Another Lassie Compilation Movie,"From the forest ranger years, from three episodes that take place while Corey Stuart is investigating the use of sailplanes as survey craft. I wish Classic Media/Sony would quit messing around with these ""movies"" and release LASSIE as season by season sets with the episodes as shown instead of crammed into a movie format. We could also use prints struck from the original masters, as these movies are badly faded and color-shifted, especially on the wildlife shots. LASSIE deserves better."
3,The Selling of Education,"""Knowledge & Money"" is a comprehensive, but long read!

4,Superfriends the Lost Episodes DVD,Love this show! Glad these episodes were released on DVD. Fans of the Superfriends and DC comics should check this DVD set.
4,Does what it's supposed to do.,"I needed a new band because the one I purchased with the slingshot ripped on the rubber portion after a few weeks of use. Based on another review here, I purchased 2 bands for when the new band inevitably gives. This band has already lasted longer than its predecessor, but I suspect it has more to do with me knowingly not pulling the band as far as it can go when shooting.Rubbing alcohol works great for lubing the forks to slide the band on, but be sure you have the band situated the way you want it to be when you shoot it - rearranging the rubber on the fork after the alcohol dries is nearly impossible without removing the band and starting over."
3,good general replacement band,I like the band quality and the way they wrap it around the pouch so there is no chance the pouch end can slip off like others I've used. I do though find the pouch to be too small for my hands making it difficult to hold and strains my fingers on repetitive use.
2,Wasn't what I expected,I expected an advanced dvd on pilates methods. The exercises are in the intermediate stage and there really aren't many exercises at all. The workout was much shorter than what I expected.
1,dont like it,"This video is very old and the flow of it is lousy. I did not like this video at all, but I gave it to a friend who has no pilates experience and she liked it."
1,Misleading Title - this is not Pilates.,"I ordered this DVD because I am interested in the Pilates method. However, when it arrived I noticed that the small print on the back said that this is not the Pilates method, that it is not recognised or approved by the Pilates Guild and that references to the word Pilates are for discriptive purposes only. In fact, the DVD contains a combination of exercises from various disciplines.In addition to that, the main focus of the real Pilates method is improving posture, core stability and flexibility of the spine, whereas this DVD is only about 'toning and sculpting'."
3,Great for a beginnner....not for a novice.,"After doing a one hour workout, you would think that every muscle in your body would be feeling it...right? WRONG.... Your tummy gets a nice work out... and you feel nice and tall after completing the video. The stretching is great.Personally, the routine is too slow for me and the instructor talks too much. I think that if she just went from one move to the other with out talking the workout would give a better payoff. By the time she started the next move...I was already 10 reps in. Also... it did not seem like there was enough repitition of the good moves and too many unnecessary moves."
1,i'm getting sleeeeeeppppeeeee,"I love Pilates, but this is the most boring excercise video I have ever done. no music, not motivating and Jennifer Kries drones. I did it a few times and threw it out. There are lots of other Pilates tapes out there, don't bother with this one."
3,Excellent introduction to Pilates,"Contrary to what other reviews state, the majority of the moves in the precision toning part of the video are Pilates moves. My only complaint is that once you have the workout down, her instructions get in the way of time that could be spent performing the moves. I don't use the sculpting portion, preferring to stick to my free weights and bands. Precision toning is a great video to learn how to perform Pilates mat work."
3,Too much time spent on instructing...,"Though it's good to have instruction on proper form, she does this throughout making it annoying after you've done it several times. It also wastes valuable work out time. It would be great if she included a routine straight through without the instruction so that once you've got the form, you can just do the routine."
3,Not What I Expected,"This was my first purchase of a pilates DVD and I have to admit that I am disappointed for the amount of money I spent. Kries spends too much time talking and less time demonstrating moves. I found the tape to be excellent for a beginner like myself, but was really looking forward to a workout that kept me moving."
3,"Excellent Instructional Video, But Boring Workout","This tape is excellent as an introduction to the pilates and yoga moves used in The Method series. You will learn the proper forms and breathing patterns. However, because of all the time devoted to instruction, it is not a workout you will do more than a few times (depending on how long it takes you to become accustomed to the correct forms)."
3,review,The book arrived on the promised date but was heavily underlined and marked. The story is a good one so I appreciated the copy even though marked.
3,This book is for the collector looking for scarce pieces.,"For my purposes this book was only mildly informational. A collector, who is looking for rare or scarce pieces may find this book more educational. By the author's own admission, their audience aim is not for the casual collector or the eager investor. As most of the pieces pictured are listed as rare or scarce I don't think the subjects will be useful for my collecting purposes.What I found the most interesting about the book was the detailed descriptions of each of the pieces and the wonderful clear pictures accompanying them. The author would not only describe the piece, he would tell you who made the piece and how his conclusion was reached based on other pieces, which have been positively identified. Similar pieces were compared in many instances and subtle differences in designs were noted to educate the reader on how to identify reproductions from the original."
1,Do not buy,"Unbalanced, heavy and uncomfortable to use, was given the impression that the pointed tip was a stylus. I do not recommend purchasing this overpriced item"
4,Difficult read.,"I had this book for a class at post graduate school. The material in the book is good, but it is unfortunate how difficult reading the book is. I think the reason for this is the translation from another language.Aside from the english of the book, the arguments presented are down so in a very logical progression and made very well."
5,A great Italian cookbook for beginners and more,This was my first cookbook 18 years ago. I still have it and use it regularly.The recipes are easy to follow and not overly complex. The dishes range from basic to solid to spectacular. Lots to choose from. The lasagna recipe has become our traditional Christmas Eve dinner and gets used many other times in the year.Excellent choice for part of a basic cookbook set.
3,Alright Book,"I have to disagree with general opinion here. I thought the writing itself was good, but I thought the characters were horrible people. All of them. The main character Eve was not likeable, neither was DJ, Eve's parents, her friend Shontay, or Travis (after he freaks out). In fact the only one I did like was the Eve's dead brother Chicago. The story did keep me reading as I was interested in who she would end up with. I thought the author totally copped out on the ending by having Travis act totally far out of character as an attempt to resolve some issues. Also, I thought her parents switched their point of view rather quickly. It seemed as if the ending of the book was rushed. When I finished the book I did not feel as if everything had been wrapped up. Good read, but not stellar."
4,Very nice..,"This is a nice little monograph....The photographs are quite good, and the text is clear. She has a few very useful algorithms. Fairly expensive for just thyroid cytopath book (for ~$150 you can get a good general cytopath text like Atkinson or Renshaw), but the quality is good."
4,All Contents,"I am a pathologist.Ordinally days, I have had difficulty to make a diagnosis of thyroid FNA slides. But when I read this book, I got so many informations, which are very useful to routine thyroid FNA diagnosis work. I am happy now.One thing to wish is a little more details, And then it would be a more powerful guide book to pathologists or cytopathologists, and even training residents.One more thing I want to get is Breast cytopathology (Essentials in cytopathology, one of serials) as soon as possible.Please let me know, when you make the breast one. Thanks a lot."
4,So far so good,"HP makes good products in my experience, and this printer has been fine, overall. For those who run Linux, ...well, I'm no expert but I was able to get this printer working without too much hassle; at least HP supports an alternative to the operating system monopoly. HOWEVER, it is annoying that the software makes it so difficult to restrict printing to black-ink-only. And that in that mode, only draft (low-quality) output is allowed (this is true in MS-Windows also.) It's of course an industry-wide practice to make as much $$ as possible on ink cartridges, and HP hasn't given us a break on that one. But at least it's *possible* to jump through all the hoops and print from the black cartridge only. I don't regret buying this printer. I guess that's high praise in this territory...."
1,DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY,"I've made the mistake of buying an HP printer on two occasions and perhaps the thuing that bothers me the most about it is a problem with ink jet printers, but here goes:I spend more money on INK for the stupid printers to print an alignment page than I do on ink to actually print what I want. Every single time I want to print something the stupid machine spits out an alignment page! Total waste of black and color ink and I suspect that this is done by design by HP. The hell with the fact that the customer has invested a small fortune in buying a desktop or laptop and a printer, let's stick it up their collective gickers by making them have to run out and buy our ink every three weeks! Bad form HP, bad form. DO NOT BUY THEIR PRINTERS!"
4,Is it a real photo? OMG,"This is one quality ""Photo"" printer! It will handel heavy duty paper. Whats weird is it will also grab 2 or 3 sheets of regular paper. I have been amazed and people who I have givem them too think they are real photographs.Also has special ""ink"" for doing just photo's."
5,Real Canon Charger!,"I got this as an additional battery charger a few months ago and it works great! It is the same battery I got with my Canon EOS 50D camera, it is not a knockoff. :-)"
1,"""OOPS""",I had to return this product because it was defective upon opening. There was something that rattled like a loose screw when turned. For an electrical product I dare not take the chance to plug it in.
5,Affordable replacement,This is a factory replacement. It works as well as the original before I accidently plugged mine in upside down. This shouldnt have made a difference but it did and I'm glad that I was able to find it here at a good price. Also had to buy a new battery. Dont plug the charger in upside down.
2,Wrong Model,"I bought this item for my girlfriend who has a cannon video camera, and had lost the battery charger that came with it. I looked up the specs of chargers on the internet, found this battery charger, and bought it. However, when I went to put the battery in the charger it wouldn't fit. I was greatly disappointed that the charger did not fit our model. I'm sure it is a good item, IF it works with your battery."
5,Smart theology well written,"Bishop Stendahl is extremely insightful and renders profound theology in well-phrased normal English. He demystifies the language of Paul's letters, giving clarity and specificity to passages that are often misinterpreted."
1,This is a CHRISTIAN self-help book,"If you are looking for a self-help book that doesn't require a particular religious view point -- DON'T BUY THIS BOOK. Certainly, don't be fooled by the fact that the author/publisher go out of their way to obscure the fact this entire book is premised on a relationship with the Christian God. No doubt this manipulation is meant for our own good -- maybe we will 'accidently' be saved. That is if you are willing to be saved by people who would misrepresent themselves. You'll have to look carefully on the back cover to find any reference to the religious beliefs which dominate this book. I for one do not appreciate being mislead, and I resent having paid for this book!"
5,"Excellent illustrations, wonderful story.",A good read-aloud story to introduce Alaskan wildlife and the changing of the season. The raven illustrations truly represent this magnificent bird.
3,Not the whole story,"I didn't want to give this book a star rating because, as I explain below, I do not consider myself competent to review it. But the review system requires that I give it something and since I was not impressed with Cowie's writing, I gave it a 3-star rating. But feel free to ignore that. The real point of this review is what follows.Potential buyers of Cowie's book should be aware that there are counterarguments to the position that she presents. Jerry Fodor has written one which is available on the web. Also, Stephen Laurence and Eric Margolis include a lengthy, detailed dismantling of Cowie's arguments in their paper entitled ""The Poverty of the Stimulus Argument"" which appeared in the British Journal of the Philosophy of Science 52 in 2001, pp 217-276. I am not competent to judge Cowie's book but anyone who is interested in it should be familiar with what Laurence and Margolis have to say."
2,Quite Disappointing,"I picked up this book when I heard that the author was going to speak at a behaviorist convention and deliver the B.F.Skinner Lecture (or a similarly titled one). I initially read only the four or five pages of this book related to behaviorism. They were simply awful. (The author is not alone in writing stuff like this).I did plod through the rest of this book. There were some minor delights as well as some minor annoyances. However, the book is a total failure for me, since nativism cannot be reconsidered properly without comapring it fairly with Skinnerian empiricism."
5,CHEROKEE UP!,"If you are searching, this is a good place to start. Garrett is a wise man, and a great teacher. Arrived as promised, on time, in good shape."
1,Ceremonies are not normally shared,I would strongely suggest not attending Cherokee Full Circle.Words are one thing power is all together a different matter.
4,excellent sham,great sham. too expensive. and the dover manor (deleted line) sham this line is based on is better...
2,Pretty bad,"Star vehicles are sort of like dead logs--it doesn't pay to look too closely.This is a period classic, and has some famous songs, but the story line is about as contrived as they come. The stars act like stars, not characters--let alone real people. It's total Hollywood, which has some appeal. But that's really all there is to it."
4,Pal Joey,Who doesn't like Frank Sinatra. He is smooth and cool and handsome and has a voice that is smooth as butter.
4,Classic Sinatra!,Hey . . . my title comment says it all. Frank had pretty well developed his persona by this time. What else do you need to say.
4,Sinatra at his finest!!,Caught this movie on TCM and totally fell in love with it! Rita Hayworth is stunning...Frank Sinatra is in top form...Kim Novak was ok...I liked her at the end much better than the start...The music is fantastic!!
2,Great songs in a tepid film.....,"Time was, we could find womanizers funny. But no longer. Frank Sinatra is a bit of a cad here, as he toys with the affections of 2 lovely women--Rita Hayworth and Kim Novak. The movie starts, in fact, as Frank (""Pal Joey"") is being run out of town by the police, for trifling with the affections of an underage girl. Settled in San Francisco, Frank uses Rita to finance his new supper club, but cannot give up his star act, Kim Novak. All very shallow, and a rather nice (sweetened up) ending.Not to deny the power of the songs--Rodgers and Hart at their best.Not to deny the beauty of the Cinematography--glorious limpid shots of 50's San Francisco.But that plot!"
2,Disappointing - Would Love to See a Good Remake,This movie took most of the great songs from the stage play and dumped them. For a theater lover this is heartbreaking. What a disappointing story. If a movie can be faithful to the theater version then this one is a class-A adulterer. Even the ending was changed and not for the better. The dubbing for the two leading ladies was also disappointing. A pretty face is not enough.
3,Entertaining songs and romance,This was a so-so story but good music from Sinatra and company.Especially nice appearance from Rita Hayworth as the other woman. She'sstill got the allureshe had as a young actress in musicals in the 40's.Kim Novak is very beautiful and sweet but out of her league against the pros.
4,WHEN FRANK SINGS THE SONGS OF DICK AND LARRY,"PAL JOEY had two revivals before the movie was made, but that was not enough for producers who decided to remove many songs from the original production and made a singer out of JOEY who was a dancer. Still ,who can resist FRANK SINATRA singing THE LADY IS A TRAMP,I COULD WRITE A BOOK and I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TIME IT WAS in his own unique way?After all these years it remains a top movie enternainment, and like FRANK used to say when he changed a lyric to the consternation of mister RODGERS ,broads won't do the dishes in earmans and pearls or maybe i just made that up.It's fascinating how FRANK could get away with this, but let's not forget that the league of feminists wasn't too strong then."
4,"Women and ladies, our best enemies or friends","Frank Sinatra is at his best in this film. He plays his own role, a singer in clubs. He starts out of money and everything and manages to get a position in a club in San Francisco. He has the opportunity to meet a lady-friend of his, an ex-singer who has become a very rich woman and he plays with the idea of a partnership with her. It will break on the simple fact that he is divided between this rich woman from his past and a new girl. The rich woman is jealous of the other and Joey is taken between the two without knowing how to choose or get out of the rivalry without being hurt. He will in the end make the good choice and move to Sacramento, leaving his past behind and going to new adventures. The film is brilliant, the actors and actresses are very good. It sure is not a deep film, but it is a very touching film where women are shown to be the real masters of the world.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU"
2,Terrible...except for the music.,"'Pal Joey"" has a terrible plot, a disinterested Sinatra, a gorgeous Rita Hayworth and Kim Novak, never one of my favorites. The music and sound track is the only thing that keeps it above one star. There is no enthusiasm or chemistry of any kind. I am not anti Sinatra. Most of the time he does very well, but not here. This movie is indeed a gasser, but not in a good way. Avoid it."
3,Pal Joey,"THREE STARS AT THEIR BEST. FRANK SINATRA AT HIS SEXIEST, KIM NOWAK IN A GOOD PERFORMANCE AND A FADING BUT STILL BEAUTIFUL RITA HAYWARD. GREAT NOSTALGIA. A GOOD ADD FOR MUSICAL COLLECTORS,"
2,Celestron Firstscope 60EQ 60mm Refractor Telescope,I cant' really rate this item because I don't remember ordering this product. I will have to research it out
3,...,I would rate this about a 3.5. Sound quality was not that great on the item. Either was picture quality for that matter. I would have expected more from this name brand.
1,"Too heavy, No warranty","I currently own several Panasonic TV's and TV/VCR Combo's and they have been for the most part trouble free. In September 2001 I bought a 27"" flat screen TV from Panasonic and it has been nothing but trouble as of April 2002. The major problem has been with support. Yes, I own a good deal of A/V gear including some Pro A/V gear, but the support problem has been with the warranty periods offered by Panasonic on large heavy screen TV's. Don't be fooled by the warranty you see here or at a retail store. The labor is only for 90 days, and they'll charge you big time for labor.Almost everything I have from Panasonic has been trouble-free, but if you do have a problem, be prepared to throw away and re-purchase because it would cost less than the labor charges."
3,Umm.. The best Ween country album?,"This record took a lot of flack when it was released, but, to tell the truth, it really has aged pretty well and sounds better a few years down the road, especially after some of the fascinating things Ween has done recently with chamber pop and soul... Basically, Ween made a pretty solid country album with some nashville studio pros. The results are as expected: musically, kind of bland, with trademark Ween lyrics. Several records later though, I 'm thinking Ween knew what they were doing all along. This CD is meant to sound like anything that comes off the nashville-assembly-line... listen to it distractedly, and you'd guess it was any Travis Tritt piece of trash... but then, you'll cath a weird reference, a strange metaphor... and, without even knowing it, you've landed it the Ween Zone. I think what they did was set out to make the best country album they could, and, all things considered, they probably did."
4,Why You Should Like Ween...,"This album typifies why I love Ween so much; it is chameleon music at its best. I love old Country and Western (Jennings, Nelson,Haggard,etc.)and they nailed it pretty good on this one. Once again Ween takes another music genre and makes it their bitch. The only track that is a head scratcher for me is ""Fluffy""; knowing that they had a couple of other tunes that was cut from this album, it makes me wonder. It is a complete throwaway track, imo.Elsewise, if you like Ween and/or Country Western, this is essential..."
4,the mock country album is a nice one,very good stuff. ween proves to be of those bands that you wouldn't think could do country music. but man would you ever be wrong. this is a lovely mellow album right here and the boys play it on the up and up for the most part. which is surprizing. of course we have the classic Piss Up A Rope which is most certainly not on the up and on. lol. that song is the bomb baby :) everything else is really nice. other favs being Powder Blue & Help Me Scrape the Mucus off My Brain. my only complain is i wish it really did have 12 songs on it. i would have like to have seen So Long Jerry put on here and something else i can't think of right now.
4,"if you truly love ween, you can get into this.","ok, so. i see a lot of people hate this album. every person i know that likes ween tells people ""i even love their country album"". and when i saw them in chicago, ever person there flipped out when they played tunes from this album just as much as any other. i also don't really see how someone can say that this is unlike any other ween. it's exactly like everything else: lyrical awesomeness and a musical chameleon.i guess to each his own. at least give it a shot before you toss it out the window like mr. one-star."
5,Unusual but Great,"I love Ween, they could put out a ""ween sings your favorite christmas songs"" cd and I buy it, and I would love it. Only ween can make a fairly odd cd and still pull it off beautifully."
4,Well.... I liked it!,"I've heard some of Ween's music, and liked it, but I was not enthusiastic enough to purchase it until I heard this CD. I can't stand Country/Western music; and I thought it was absolutely brilliant the way Ween ""over-does"" it, sort of a satire. When I heard this CD at a friend's house, I just had to go buy it. I played it at work, and two of my coworkers bought it. I played it for a friend of mine, he bought a copy and played it at work, and three of his coworkers went out and bought it! But perhaps this is not a good choice for Ween fans...I think this says it all: the title is ""12 Golden Country Greats"" and there are only 10 songs on the CD."
4,end of confusion,"the '12' in ""12 Golden Country Greats"" refers to the number of musicians they had on the record; not the number of songs."
4,Fresh new direction for Ween,"I would have to say that I highly enjoy listening to this album, it brings out the lighter side of brown that is Ween. I'm Holding You puts you in the mood for some good counrty twang, then it jumps into Japanese Cowboy with some excellent slide playing. Piss Up A Rope is always a chuckler and you start to see the zaniness come out in the lyrics and keyboard solos. Mr. Richard Smoker invokes some kind of homoerotic tendencies, but a damn good song nonetheless. Fluffy, Powder Blue, and Jerry don't exactly hold up later on in the CD, but they redeem themselves with a beautiful rolling acoustic groove on You Were The Fool. Defineitely worth a listen!!"
4,Witty and authentic,"This amazing and amusing album was recorded in country territory with the help of genuine country musicians. Great tunes and authentic playing make for an enjoyable listening experience, until one listens closely to the lyrics. Well, the words might put some people off but I found this marriage of the country ethos with post-modern crudeness and explicit expression quite different and refreshing. My favourites are the moving and hilarious but rude I'm Holding You and the politically incorrect Mr Richard Smoker. The lyrics are impressively clever and witty despite the obvious vulgarity and the melodies very catchy and hummable. I'm not sure traditional country fans will like this, but I think it is original and hilarious at times. Ween are the masters of many styles and did a splendid job with this country excursion."
2,Not very Weenish sounding.,"If you like Ween's other releases, then you still have nothing to go on as to whether or not you'll like this one. There's nothing on this one to remind you of anything else from any of their others. A better guage would probably be to ask yourself if you like country music. If you do, you might like this CD."
1,unlistenable,"Hoping for another classic album from the Ween brothers, I picked this album up. Out of the hundreds of albums I have bought in my lifetime, this has been the only one I was truly disgusted with. I tossed it out of the window driving home from a friend's house. Most expensive frisbee I have ever purchased."
4,My first check weld adjustment.,"This is the first replacement barrel I've owned. The bluing doesn't quite match up with my Wingmaster's but it's close enough. For the price, it's great performance, easy to install, and appears sturdy enough. No complaints."
4,A re-release of two great stories,"I want to set the record straight, a previous reviewer said that this was a compilation of ""The Holmes-Dracula Files"" and ""The Dracula Tapes"". It's not, the two books are ""Thorn"" and ""Old Friend of the Family"". ""Thorn"" is about Dracula's life in Italy and Hungary before he ""died"" and modern day New Mexico. A great read and my favorite in the whole series. ""Old Friend of the Family"" is set in modern Chicago and the descendants of Mina Harker."
5,AWESOME,"I bought this game a few days after it came out, and I have to say, that this game rocks. It takes the PS2 to it's full capacity, with breathtaking graphics, a great story line, and excellent gameplay. It's the next half-life!!! But what makes the game truly awesome , besides it's fantastic gameplay, graphics, and sound, is the that you can blow up ALMOST ANY WALL!!! Have you ever had a door that you just couldn't unlock on half-life or any other 1st person shooter? And you just get so mad you wanna shout? Well, than this is the game for you. for this game, all you have to do is get out your R-launcher, take a well-aimed shot,and......KA-BOOM!!! Your problems are solved. Be warned tough, you cannot destroy well-reinforced walls or doors(obviously). So with this unique feature, and it's excellent gameplay, graphics, and sound; I rate this a 5-star game(I would make it a 10-star game, but unfortunatly, you can't do that). If you buy this game, trust me, you won't be disappointed."
2,ok game,I didnt like this game all that much because i thought it was drawn out and the game wouldnt let you play. meaning it wasnt very realistic in the sence of human movement. but the rest was ok. some of my friends liked it so i think you should rent it first then if you like it buy the game.
1,A Definite Rental First!,"I'll be frank. I purchased this game because it was cheap and I miss the old Doom shoot'em ups so I was feeling a bit nostalgic. But I must say that Red Faction is not a very good game. The graphics look like something from Super Nintendo, the controls will definitely get you wacked if the monkey enemies disquised as humans don't kill you first and the character voices! My god I though I was hearing people talk through a pillow being stuffed in their faces. Purely Awful!"
3,Okay,"Red Faction is a great game overall, but it has a lack of levels. Also, the controls are terrible. DOn't listen to the other reviewers, the game is not the best and the Geomod mode is really dumb, since it's just looks like a rock cutting into a wall. Worth it if you like half-life, but not for unreal tournament lovers. not a good game overall, though."
4,a really good buy,The geo mod on this is the best thing I ever experienced in a game. Theres something about blowing through the wall slaughtering everything on the other side and going on your merry way that apeals to me.The graphics are exelent. And the multi player for computer is pretty well done. If you like first person shooter than get this game it delivers a good bit of entertanment and will satisfy the average gamers needs.
2,Completely Disappointing,"I rented this game, and I'm glad I did, because I was actually thinking about buying. I found the graphics unimpressive, the gameplay stale, and the GeoMod to be completely overhyped. So you can blow holes in walls...great. How about cutscenes that don't sound like they're written by 12-year olds or gameplay that engages? I really felt that this game was, at the very best, just another first person shooter, and a pretty boring one at that."
4,good but could be better,"the best part of this game is glancing over all the destruction you have created after a firefight; large gaping holes in the rock walls, broken concrete structures, scorch marks all litter the landscape after an entanglement with the enemy. unfortunately, the enemy moves as though perpetually stuck on axle grease which makes them very hard to hit when aiming manually. this brings up another beef of mine: auto aiming is generally a MUST; when playing with auto aim off, it took forever to kill bad guys because they glide across the terrain in an erratic manner. the a.i leaves quite a bit to be desired too. it's good but could be better (with definite anticipation for r.f2) i can't even play this after having played halo."
2,dont like it.,This game is a ... james bond. you are stuck on another planet and the workers have revolted and you must escape. I probibly shouldn't of written a review for this game because i haven't got passed the first level it is to complicating. if you like to be puzzeled and stumped this is a game for you. also very boring. must use both joy sticks to controll your guy.
1,possibly the most overrated game i've ever seen,"i don't want to waste too much time on this crappy game... it's just not good at all, and it's pretty funny how everyone keeps saying it's good just because other people and game review sites say it is. maybe it's because this game was made years ago, before better games came along. whatever. nothing sets this game apart as fun or special, be it graphics or gameplay or story."
3,An ADULT,"...I tested this game, and it is a definite hit in the making. I see too many similarities with other shooters, but it's still one to buy upon its release...."
3,old,"This game was very good when it came out, but it can't hold up to timesplitters 2, frontline, nightfire, or a lot of shooters for other systems. The graphics and A. I. aren't very good. Blowing everything up is just a gimmick. I rarely used it and there are a lot of limitations on what you can blow up. There is a good weapon selection,a good length, and not much else."
3,Red Faction is Dissapointing,"Red Faction looked like the coolest game. Then I bought it. Dont get me wrong the single player mode is cool, the graphics are good. The geo mode is pretty interesting as well. But the multiplayer mode is terribly dissapoiting. Other than picking your character and opponents and level there is nothing else. No multi modes, just basic deathmatch. No gun options, and no geo mode objective based mutli gaming promised by thq. If you want a good single player game go for this title. If your expecting a Goldeneye esque multi mode stick with something else. This game has fallen way short of expectations."
3,"Good Graphics, Bad Controls","This game has decent graphics and pretty good AI but the controls stink. All of the first person shooters for PS2 are like this, except bond. When you want to turn durections, you have to use both joysticks, and thats dumb. If you want a shooter game, get bond, its not as good as goldeneye was but its still fun, and it has a kickin' muiltiplayer game."
3,"Eh. It's ""okay"".","I dunno. Maybe I'm just used to using a mouse for FPS games, but my first impression of Red Faction was that the controls are kinda klunky. Changing the direction you're facing is frustratingly slow. Thankfully, you can take a fair amount of damage, so it seems that they tuned the game to take this into account.This isn't a bad game, it's just not a great game. The story is a bit weak in the beginning - the miners are volunteers, but there are guards? Looks more like a prison to me. I'm willing to suspend disbelief for a little while tho.One caveat for this review - I did not finish the game in its entirety, so the story may get a lot deeper. My general impression of the gameplay is that if you're a die-hard Half-Life fan, you might be disappointed."
4,WOW this is fun...ZZZZZZZZZZZ,"You play the game but once you beat it, it gets REALLY boring. After you beat it all you can do is play Multiplayer because you already know what happens. But other wise it was a great game!!"
4,Great Game!!,"This is a great game that will give you hours of entertainment, but somewhere along the lines it gets old. The single player is great until about three fourths of the way through when you have to save before every door because you don't know what is about to kill you on the other side. The ability to blow holes in the walls is amazing, it's about the only reason the multiplayer is worth playing though. I think the one thing that would make this game a lot better is if it was broken into levels more like goldeneye, so you could go back and replay your favorite ones, instead of making it one long, long, repetetive battle. Even with it's flaws, I would definetely recommend this game to anyone!!"
5,A Fun Game,"When I first turned on this game, it grabbed me right from the start. Going back to the old theme of the battle for freedom by some badly treated colonists on a future Mars. The theme is great and the gameplay is original. It does go along with the style of the Metal of Honor series with much improved diffrences. The vehicles you are allowed to control, as well as the ability to go just about were ever you like, not confined to one way like metal of honor. This game gets my highest rating for it's great playability, and although the controls are a little difficult to master at first, it was a surprisingly good game for anyone who like first person shoot-em-up style games."
3,"Not bad, but not great","After much hype, I was expecting an *awesome* game. Well, it's pretty good, but not ""creepy/intense"" good. The graphics are great, but the sound is mediocre. In the ""story"" mode, the game is fun, but not edge-of-your-seat gaming. I mean, after 5 minutes into the story mode, I already had 6 different guns, including a machine gun & flamethrower.In multiplayer mode, again good but not great. With the split screen, all bots look roughly the same, including your human counterpart/partner. Which means it's darn near impossible to keep from shooting him, if you're trying to play cooperative.Overall, I thought ""Medal of Honor"" was a much better FPS."
3,Disapointing,"This game was a BIG disapointment for me! First, the GEOMOD system is pure non-sense. There are a few places you can blow through, especially at the start, but for the most part, it plays no role in the game. Disregard that ""Can't find the key create your own door ...,"" garbage on the back. Also, the game has horrible, unpolished stealth missions where the gaurds seem to have a random field of vision and it is impossible to sneak the entire way through them. Not that it's a big deal for me, my favorite game is Xenogears, but the graphics are pretty bad in some spots, and especially during the cut scenes, and the acting is comparable to Resident Evil, lol. The game also gets rediculously hard towards the end. There is this one part where there is this series of long hallways with very high sealings, and gaurds at the end with guns that kill you in one hit, and a giant flying machine with vey heavy machine guns flying at you. All in all, I would save my money, and rent this game."
5,Awesome FPS game,this is one of the best first person shooters i have played so if you are a fan of them i reccomend you buy this game.
4,"One of my favorites, despite the controls.","Ok, the story's a little cheesy, but it's a great 1st person shooter, and the Geo-mod rocks! I don't need keys anymore. Also, the game gets harder and harder and harder. While some people would throw their PS2 out the window during the last few msiions, I find it challenging. Save often is the secret to winning this game. The bosses are godlike in this game also. Incredibly hard. Only problem with this game is the controls, which reminded me of Resident Evil. Ugh! Oh well, I got used to it after a while."
5,"Greatest 1st-Person Shooting game, EVER!!!","This game has the best shooting graphics for any PS2 game! The blood, equipment, environment, weaponary, voices, and people are incredibly realistic. It uses GEO-MOD Technology, 15 real-life weapons of mass destruction--from,: 12mm Pistol to a Fusion Rocket Launcher!!, you can hijack, drive, and destroy 5 fully armed and awesome land,air, and sea vehicles. And, there's also 20 HUGE, awesome environments/levels, including: an underwater research lab, an underground mine, a waste land, and many more!! If you like shooting games, than ""RED FACTION"" is defenetily for you!! ""Join The REVOLUTION!!"""
3,"good FPS, solid graphics, story, and play","this game has that something special, a combination of gameplay and graphics and other extras that make it a great game. Its a lot of fun to play.I would have given 5 stars but the game is actually too long, if you can believe that. The animation for the enemies, and the character animation in general is pathetic...they just sort of slide around on the surface.while most of the story was good, the story ending was a little uneventful. geo-mod is interesting but barely gets integrated into the story or gameplay. weapon switching is tedious at best."
4,Cool Game A Must For The Collection,"This game is really good and worth your money if you like first person shooters. The game is cool just the multi-player got me hooked I haven't never played the 1 player mode, but I know its gotta be a delight. This is a highly recomended game. It is good I can say, but I have to stop my likes!! This game isn't that good for people to have to pay (the price) for it is just outrageous for this game."
4,Great but not as good...,A perfect game by destroying and making sniping holes tunnels to place to place and weapons!A must buy if your a fan of shooters! But another thing is that if you like demolishing things up with explosives BUY IT!!!!!(but not as good as some shooters)
5,PS2 at its best!,"Well, i have to say, this is the most enjoyable game i have for my PS2 right now. I own SSX, Madden 2001, TTT, and Red Faction, and the one game that i play the most has to be Red Faction. The 1 player mode is so large and it pulls you in, i couldnt put this controller down for a long time. And then even once i was finished with the 1 player game, i spent many hours again, beating the game, again. Also, 2 player mode is alot more enjoyable then you would imagine. Being able to make lil' ""caves"" and ambush your enemies provides for quite a few laughs. This game reminds me alot of the N64's ""Perfect Dark"", in terms of gameplay, story, and multiplayer. Real good game"
5,The Best Out For PS2!!,"Red Faction is the best out for the Playstation 2 right now it is AWESOME!!! I think its the best game ever, but thats just me. Go pick it up today!!!"
5,music and history in one!,"If you aren't familiar with the first album you should definitely check this out. This is a cooperative project done with the national association of musical education. If you have any nephews or grand-kids that you want to share your love of military music with this is the album for you. Along with the first Liberty for All album, these discs educate while they entertain. They mix the music of history with interesting images and narrative. This is a good one for those who are looking for a different kind a album or for any young person who loves history."
4,one of the best,"this is one of the best books i've ever been able to find on bonsai. it helped me tremendously. answers a lot of questions i was left with after reading other books. pictures are just the ones i need; not display, but process. that's important."
3,Too small for HD prosumer,"Very nice bag that is fine for a $200 or $300 Camcorder.I bought it for my new HD camcorder but, adding a shotgun mic all but made it too small and now that I want a wide angle lens, it is definitely too small.Again, nice quality and small enough to travel with....IF you are not going to need more than an extra battery and a couple of tapes"
5,Enough room for camera & accessories,"We bought this bag for our Canon Vixia HF 200 digital video camera. It is well made and has enough room for the camera, the charger and a few extras."
5,Canon Carrying Case - Less is More,"This Canon camera bag is perfect. The size is exactly what I need and holds all my accessories. The quality is wonderful and it is easy to carry around.There are compartments for all the little extras and I never have trouble finding anything I need. It has a hand strap, as well as a shoulder strap. In addition, there are belt loops so it can be carried on your waist. Very compact, yet roomy.It is very attractive to look at and has the Canon name displayed visably on the bag. Good things come in small packages.I am very happy with my choice."
4,"Nice bag, fits Canon Vixia HF20","I was hesitant to purchase this product based on some of the previous reviews and the web site images. However, it turned out to be a very nice product. Materials appear to be a mix of leather and nylon. The bag is opened via a top flap with parallel zippers. A pull handle operates both zippers at the same time. I found this a little unorthodox but I can live with it.The main compartment is divided into two sections and there is just enough room for the camcorder, an extra battery, power supply, power supply cord and remote. A zippered front pocket is big enough for two A/V cables. This pocket also has two small internal pockets for small items like memory cards."
5,A Perfect Fit!,"This case hold my Elura 100 and accessories perfectly. Not too big, not too small. Plus it's well padded. The movable divider lets you snug the camera to one side while making room for accessories on the other. Tip: The upper flap will hold two Mini-DV tapes in it's zippered pouch, which adds an extra layer of protection up top!"
5,The color,Just received this color in the mail. It is so lovely. It compliments my skin color very well considering the shade of my skin.
5,Beautiful Colors,"I received Orgasm, Purple Rain, and Versailles as a Christmas present. I am absolutely in LOVE with all of the colors. They glide on smoothly and to my surprise don't chip for quite some time. I am a horseback rider so any nail polish that stays on for more than three days is a miracle in my eyes. Orgasm is a beautiful peachy color with a gold shimmer. The picture doesn't do it justice. Purple rain is a gorgeous rich purple color with purple/blue shimmer. Versailles is a cream color with gold shimmer. It was pretty but I am tan and believe it would look 100% better on fair skin. I would recommend these polishes to anyone that loves good quality beautiful nail polish colors!"
2,Don't believe the hype!,"Considering all the good reviews I was extremely disappointed in this product. It's one of the cheapest quality nail polishes I've ever used, chipping within hours of being put on (while I slept no less!) & lasting no more than 3 days total. By that time it was chipped halfway down each nail & looking like a 2 week old manicure. I'm pretty careful about my hands, wearing gloves while I do dishes etc. but that made no difference, it seemed every time I moved a new piece came off.Nars is *supposed* to be a high-end product, commanding top dollar for their cosmetics. This is the 3rd product I've used & the 3rd time I've been disappointed. I highly recommend you skip them entirely & take yourself to a MAC store! MAC's cosmetics last 3 times as long, contain higher pigments & are of much better quality for far less money. I was taken in by the hype, I should've stuck by the brand I trust.Not impressed, Nars."
3,Pretty but not what expected,"I ordered Arabesque because it looked like a shimmery pink. But when I received it, it is actually a pink glitter polish. Might be great for someone going out to a party, but not really workable for everyday wear. It will probably go to a friends teen."
4,"ARCO/Aircam 18, Mitsubishi A6M1/2/2n Zero-Sen","When this book was published in 1970, it became the standard reference for everyone who wanted to know what a Mitsubishi Zero looked like. Still one of the most densely packed photograph-books about the Zero, it is now no longer available from its publisher, and one has to find it on the second hand market. As with all books in the Osprey/Aircam series -in the US published as Airco/Aircam- it is well worth searching for. One would hope that the publisher would consider a re-issue every 20 years or so, but until now that has not been the case. That is even more to be regretted as one consideres that the volume about the Zero was a volume 1, implying that they had more material and that a volume 2 was also considered."
5,"Well-written, general overview of the field","Going to a depth that's surprising for such a work, especially considering how much ground it covers - how many disciplines it addresses, this is a very accessible yet challenging read that kept me going straight through. I love the history in it especially and earned a lot."
4,Fascinating,"I did think the book disintegrated in the last third, but the first parts were fascinating. I reread and reread how he explains that the conscious brain perceives things a half second after they happen, and back-peddles so it perceives them in real time. I couldn't avoid concluding that what the author was saying was that the conscious mind literally GOES BACK IN TIME to be in sync with WHEN an event actually happened. Did other readers understand it that way? An amazing book."
2,How scientific is this book ?,"This book contains some fascinating theories that I didn't know yet, or had never looked at it that way. For instance the part about thermodynamics and the connection with information theory and probability theory I found very interesting,although it has little to do with consciousness.I have one serious problem with the book : Norretranders is not intellectually honest. He attempts too much to force his theory upon his readers, all the while oversimplifying, using suggestive language (the word `information' is used in different contexts, with different meanings and it doesn't become clear from reading the text), and avoiding problematic questions.The result is that the book is very tiresome to read, and its conclusions cannot be trusted.It raised some interesting points though, that's the reason why I 've continued reading."
1,How many times...?,"The author repeated the same ideas so many times in order to get across various points regarding information, disorder and entropy in the first 100 pages that, feeling frustrated and lectured to to such a degree, I ripped the book in half and threw it in a road-side bin. Mr Norretranders is obviously a highly intelligent man, and knows how to write, but would have produced a far more engaging book had he assumed that some of his readership also knows how to think."
3,"Good, but must be read critically","The beginning of this book is excellent, and its worth buying for the references alone. However, towards the middle and end of the book the author makes some irrational claims without any evidence at all. In particular, the authors claims that particular religions are more highly advanced or evolved than others are baseless, and extremely biased. I found them insulting. Nevertheless, it is worth reading past these faults, as the scientific material is fascinating. Those areas which are properly referenced and argued are some of the best reading I have done this year."
5,Thought Changing Book,For me this is one of those books that changed my way of thinking about reality and my relation to it. I read it a few years ago and keep coming back to it time and again for insights and inspiration.
3,Good but verbose,"This book was an interesting tour through modern theory on information and consciousness, with alot of the author's own spin on the issues thrown in.My only complaint is that it could have been about half the length and still conveyed the exact same information just as effectively. The author has a tendency to repeat himself over and over again for pages on end. I ended up skimming over much of the book because it was the same point being made many times over, and I don't feel like I missed out on any of the author's ideas by doing this."
1,yellow LED looks red,"Purchased the first board E750 from amazon and put on the wall and started to play at lunchtime with workmates. All worked fine until playing cricket and you get two of the same numbers and then it turns red and then on the third dart it turns more red. The LED is supposed to be yellow. After sending it back thinking that it was a bad board, we purchased another one from Hayneedle. This one too was doing the same thing. So called Hayneedle and they said they didn't see any problems. Also called DMI who makes the board and they too said they have not seen the problem. So bought a second board from Hayneedle and this one too was bad. So far have sent back three boards. Called DMI again and said no one is sending back this board. So either i'm having the worst of luck or the rest of you that have bought this board is playing with a very red (yellow) LED"
5,Great book/photographer,"I have had the chance to know Arthur personally, he was my black and white darkroom photography teacher. The skills I have learned from him I will carry with me through my entire life. This book explains him greatly as a photographer, he is focused on detail and that is why he uses a view camera in his photography. I have heard the storys behind these photographs and it is wonderful how he captured them. This book is great as a gift or for yourself, I highly recommend it."
5,Want to master B&W Landscapes?,"Pay attention to the photos in this book.It's true what they say: many of the finest photographs you will ever see come from people you've never heard of. For every Ansel Adams, there are a dozen Arthur Lazar's hard at work. Perhaps you don't know their names, but the plain fact is, their images demonstrate not only a technical mastery, but a more human understanding of the medium as well.I owe much of what I know about photography to Arthur Lazar, so I'm less than neutral. But that doesn't make the imagery in this book any less superb. Several images are among the very best I've seen; I wouldn't hesitate to compare them to the works of more famous artists like Adams or Weston. I was fortunate to be able to learn from this man; I just hope that with time my images will be equally compelling.If you love B&W photography, get this book. You won't regret it."
1,Piece of Junk...DO NOT BUY!!,"The biggest problem with this machine is that there is no keyboard and the touch screen absolutely does not work. Searching for a word using the touch screen was absolutely impossible and sometimes would take up to five minutes to find a word. It Proved to be so bad that it was utterly useless in Egypt and I had to buy a paper dictionary while there.Another problem was that the display contrast was really light even at the highest settings was hard to see, so when i couldn't pronounce a word, the show and point method proved difficult. In addition the dictionary does not give you an English pronunciation and was utterly useless for someone who has a hard time reading arabic.- Not to mention that many translations did not include vowels.The speaker was practically useless as well considering only about half of the words had the ability to be amplified.This dictionary is a worthless piece of junk, and ridiculously expensive.You are better off with a paper dictionary."
4,Kevin Sharp's CD,"I'm not a big country music fan but once in a while I like it and this CD is good. I bought it for the song ""Love At The End Of The Road."" Other than that, I'm not really qualified to evaluate a country music CD.Note for: Please Help Me Find this song, May 18, 2000Reviewer: ""rbkjohnston"" - See all my reviewsThis is the best CD you'll ever buy. There is a song on here titled ""Nobody Knows."" It was remade by someone else. I want this song extremely bad but can't seem to find it anywhere or find who the artist is. Any help would be greatly excepted. thanks Rebecca---------------------------------------------------------I'm sure you must have found out by now that Babyface did the most popular version of ""Nobody Knows."" If not, well I hear it all the time on LOVE 94, a smooth-jazz station in Miami but available on the Internet to be listened to. Good luck."
1,A dissapointment,"I first read ""Compulsion"" and loved it. Bought three Kellerman books, the first of which was ""Obsession"". Yuck. Way too complex and weak plot leaves the reader tired."
3,Mediocre at Best,"I am a long time lover of Alex and his crew especially Milo but apparently this book was such a sleeper I actually forgot I read it which never happens unless it has been years and even then I rememeber something. It did not have some of the thrill of his past books and I believe it was a (2) day read which in itself says a lot, however I do enjoy his descriptions of L.A and the streets and freeways because since I now live in ND it remimds me of home, having traveled those same streets many times in my own life, I never give much thought to Robin but I love the dog and of course you have to love Milo so that makes the read somewhat worth it."
1,Disappointing...,"I've read several Kellerman books, and I have to say I'm very disappointed in this one. The plot was both dull and confusing. I couldn't wait to be done with it!! His other books seemed much better."
2,A Drag,"Terrific people, as usual, but it seems just filling space with words. The detectives keep yakking away about POSSIBLE scenarios instead of advancing the plot. First time in all the Delaware novels I've felt disappointed or wondered whether I should pass on the book."
1,Waste of time and money,This is one of the worst books I've read in a long time. The plot was vague and the conclusion unsatisfying. It was surely not worth my time or my money. Very disappointing
4,Good but not great!,"Alex Delaware novels are becoming routine, and in that routine the plots all seem to run together. There are a few interesting twists and Kellerman is such an smooth writer that at times it feels almost new. I think it is time to leave Alex behind, take a chance and create a new, more interesting character. Alex Delaware just isn't that intersting any more, and his cases are becoming predictable. He doesn't seem to have any flaws that make him compelling, and a hero with few or no flaws become dull sooner or later and Alex has reached that point.If you haven't read any previous Delaware novels you will enjoy this one more than those of us who have been fans for more than a decade, so although I felt a little disappointed the newer fans might find it more enjoyable, so have at it."
2,A Hard Read!,"Extremely disappointing if you're a die hard Kellerman/Alex Delaware fan. This novel was barely kept alive by its characters whom we've grown to love over the years. Perhaps as one other reviewer suggested, it's time for a new ""hero"" for Mr. Kellerman, or perhaps he should try a different genre because this one was particularly difficult to plod through and I would not recommend to anyone who does not have a loyalty to the cast of Kellerman's Delaware series."
3,Lunesta,"Kellerman's book was filled with so many what if's, I forgot what the real theme was and went to sleep instead. The characters, and some of the dialoge was confusing. I also didn't like all the lying to the client. Too many characters that we never met in real life clogged up the works. Often times, the reading seemed like a remark made on page 290. ""Well, that was a whole lot of nothing."" Let's put some gas in the engine Johnathan."
1,boring,I think this series has run its course. The story line for this one is very tired. The main characters go through the same motions. I could not work up any interest or empathy for any of the 'victims.' Everything seems to happen off stage.His son's new novel is better.
2,Glad Kellerman is not a psychotherapist...,"anymore, anyway. His world is divided into white and black - all right for pulp fiction, not for psychology. I wouldn't want him to try to make his characters any deeper, either. Even though Alex Delaware might recommend a patient take medication, Jonathan Kellerman thinks less of human beings who do. His ""good"" characters (victim/heroes), are too strong and good to succumb to needing medication. Hollywood = bad people. One of the worst villains in the book is named Robert Fisk, and likes healthy food.But it's not a terrible read. I did lose some of the threads in the middle, like others. Milo and Rick's relationship is great to have highlighted, and there are some vivid scenes. I'll probably read more of Kellerman's books."
2,Painful to Finish,"I should have listened to the reviews before buying this book. No plot, unless you like reading over 400 pages to a disappointing, unfulfilling non-ending. Hard to keep track of all the characters, their relationships and their aliases. Confusing. No more Kellerman for me."
3,where's the last CD?,This was a 10 CD production and I only got 9 CDs. Can some one tell me how it ends?
3,Too Much Theorizing and Talk,"I've been a fan of Jonathan Kellerman and his Alex Delaware novels for twenty years. ""Obsession"" works in a convoluted plot of porn stars, dope addicts, and college students. What I missed in this novel was any tension or newness in Alex's relationship with Robin. So this was more straight procedural and less emotional than other works by Kellerman. ""Billy Straight"" (not a Delaware) and ""Bad Blood"" were better."
3,solid story as usual,I'm never disappointed with this series since the books are all well written with alot of detail. With this one I did find myself losing track of the characters since there were so many and I didn't finish it feeling totally blown away or surprised. But it was a satisfying read which held my interest until the end.
3,Short But Sweet: I'm Over Alex Delaware,"The latest in the series is pedestrian and maddeningly slow moving. I just finished it yesterday and I can't tell you the plot; not a great reflection on the story telling involved.Maybe it is time for Kellerman to abandon the Delaware character and spend some time on books featuring Milo Sturgis? Originally a throw-away part of the Alex Delaware contributing cast, he is a far more interesting character these days."
2,Not his worst....,"Kellerman's last few books have been forgettable to say the least and I hoped that this would display the quality of his early writing. While it was not a total waste of time, it came close. Far too much print was devoted to the half-hearted team meetings of people in mud colored clothing as they outlined ever more convoluted theories as to who had done what to and with whom. This is yet another book that lacks credibility or suspense."
2,What did Patty Bigelow do? (2.5 *s),"The deathbed warning or ""confession"" by emergency room nurse Patty Bigelow to her college student daughter Tanya showed promise, but the book is ultimately unsatisfying.The character connections are too convenient, if not confusing: the drug-user neighbor of Patty who maybe fathered a deviant child with ex-porn star other neighbor with the child as a teen-ager having unseemly dealings with the son of the sister of the drug-user, the same drug-user found strangled shortly after Patty died - and so it goes.Apparently the author assumes that the characters are well known from previous books, because serious character development is totally absent. For example, it would have been nice for Alex Delaware's live-in girlfriend/wife Robin and detectives Petra Connor and Milo Sturgis to be other than sketches. The reader can decide if Patty's supposed involvement in a confessed action is actually established or handled well."
3,"Too Talky, Rather Annoying","There seemed to be too many interrelated characters here and quite honestly I just couldn't keep track of them - by the time I finished Chapter 24 I was completely baffled about who was who and who knew whom and when & why, etc. Just too confusing. Also the central character, Tanya, was too annoying to be likeable or appealing: I was sick to death of an adult referring to her mother as 'Mommy' constantly - that was more likely to be done by a 6-year-old. I just couldn't work up any sympathy for her, and everytime she spoke and said 'Mommy' (mommymommymommy - aaaiiieeehhh!) I wanted to smash her head against the wall and say GROW UP!"
2,Doesn't measure up...,"I must confess that I have only read a couple of Kellerman's novels, however, I completely enjoyed them. This one just didn't measure up to his ability to create a page-turner. I thought there was far too much dialogue, little mystery, irrelevant characters who only muddied the waters. I would prefer a book to be shorter rather than extended by fluff. I expect sharp, concise writing with developed, significant characters from someone with Kellerman's credentials. Too many names in the mix and it becomes difficult to maintain a smooth storyline; it becomes too ""busy"". I won't say that I will never read another of his books, but I hope they are better than Obsession!"
2,Obsession,"I was very disappointed in this book and would certainly not consider it a 'best seller' candidate. Kellerman's constant use of dialog without the 'he said', 'she said' phrases was overdone to the extent of being ridiculous. If an unknown writer, such as I, were to present a manuscript like this to a publisher, it would probably end up in file 13, and I would be papering my bathroom walls with yet another rejection letter.The story line was good, and I continued to force myself to put up with the writing style so as to find out 'who done it?'. But I will not recommend it to my comembers of the First Editions Book Club at my favorite independent bookstore."
1,obsession smells like bad fish,"I have read every one of the Alex Deleware series...some are good and others stink. Beware.....This one smells like bad fish. I have to wonder if J. Kellerman is using a ghost writer, or if Faye wrote this one."
2,So So,"This is a Ho Hum one from J. Kellerman. The setup in the first pages is interesting and contains the obscure premise for the remainder of the effort. The story proceeds like a scavenger hunt/charades game. Lots of meetings between various main and axillary characters and tidbits revealed each time. Finally a big climax. Then there is a gratuitous after thought in the last few pages.As another commenter mentioned, Robin continues to be an irritant."
2,Boring.......,"Although I'm usually a fan of Milo and Alex, this book was really boring. I had a hard time even finishing it because I didn't care about any of the characters. The plot was thin and a bit far fetched. When does Alex actually see any paying clients and make money???? I think I'll skip future books."
2,Not like they used to be,"I hate to say it but the last few deleware novels have been rather boring.. and this one was really bad.Ive read every book in the alex deleware series and for me at least it seems they have run thier course. This book was very dull. I found myself wanting to just ""get through it"" so I can start the next one (since its already sitting on my shelf) and this one just dragged on and on. rather then be a cant put down novel it was a difficult to pick back up one... which is said because Ive been a fan of this series since at least the early 90's..None of the characters other then of course milo and alex really interested me much. Ill give the last one I have..(compulsion I think) a shot and hopefully its improved. You know there is a problem when a certain bookseller is closing its stores due to bankruptcy and its the last day of openingand everything is 90% off and nothing is left on the shelf but kellerman's books.."
2,"A real ho-hummer, unfortunately","About half-way through this book, I realized I didn't really care who did it. Or why. Or about any of the characters in the plot-line other than our regulars -- Alex, Milo, and Robin. I think the initial plot device, a vague deathbed confession from an unlikely murderer, was a good idea. The rest of the plot was a hot mess, involving characters discussed, but never really ""present"" in the book. I have loved many of Jonathan Kellerman's books, but this one didn't deliver."
1,convoluted,"Kellerman has been my favorite author. This story is so convoluted and ill conceived that I lost interest each and every time I attempted to pick up another thread. The story of a death bed confession (maybe) where an entire police dept. and psychological backup devotes all their time to finding out an supposed secret is just not believable. Sorry Jon, this one misses the target."
1,Too much for so little.,"A truly disappointing effort. Alex lies regularly and with impunity to his client. Milo is a pain. Way too inartfully drawn characters to keep up with, and, an absurd plot. The dying nurse tells her adopted 19 year old daughter that she did something bad years before and on this slender fact Alex, Milo, Petra, the entire L.A. police department and a swat team are out there to catch an improbable psychopath. To keep our interest the psycho kills a few unnecessary cypher creatures which provides a trail to his inevitable demise. Someone tell J.K. to spend some serious time with his next Delaware novel or I will be buying his next novel in the closeout bin."
1,Absolute rubbish,"That's it. Jonathanan Kellerman I gave you one last try, and you failed. This has to be the worst book I have read by anyone in years. A convoluted nonsensical plot with so much padding the author should be in the upholstery business. At least half the book is taken up by poorly developed characters arguing about whether this or that happened, or perhaps it was that or this, or perhaps none of the above. And at the end I simply did not care who had done what to whom and why. In fact I wonder if the author felt the same way.Thomas H Cook and Dennis Lehane, you have nothing to fear from this author. You guys rule."
3,tedious,I almost stopped reading this several times. Seemed choppy. Even the twist at the end didn't make me like it.
2,Couldn't follow a thing,"I haven't read many of his books (I think one, maybe two), but at least one of them I liked because I put him on my library list.This one was terrible in my opinion.At first I thought I was just tired, but even days later I couldn't follow much (I mean I did, but it was like drudgery) & there was no flow to the reading at all. For me the writing was all over the place. Not so much the story line, but the words themselves.Yes I finished it & towards the middle & end it got slightly better, but if someone was reading this book for the first time, I'm sure they wouldn't pick his other books up.I'll have to see if his other books keep me interested enough to continue with all of his work."
3,"Worth Reading for fans of Alex, Milo and Company","I've read every Alex Delaware novel Jonathan Kellerman has published and enjoy them for his great Southern California characters as well as the well realized LA settings. Lately I've noticed the books kind of start to fall apart and strain plausibility toward the conclusion. OBSESSION starts to fall apart quite early in the book and as others have said it is hard to suspend disbelief that the LA Police Department would take such an interest in what a respectable dying woman ""confesses"" with so little detail. And again like another reviewer I find Robin totally annoying and if I was writing the series would have never let Alex take her back."
2,finish or not finish,"Thought I would look at the reviews. They are not very good.I'm 3/4's done and I'm beginning not to care if I finish this book or not.It is very boring and nothing seems to happen, just alot of words. Glad I got it from the library and did not buy it like I usually do."
2,Worthless but Pretty,"I bought this a few years ago, and it's worked for about the first 6 months. The needle gets stuck every single time and we have done everything to try and fix it... WD40'ing the gears, etc but nothing works. It's completely not worth it."
2,Not close to the River God,"I really didn't like this book at all. The River God was the first book of Wilbur Smith's I had read, and LOVED it. So I bought this one with great anticipation. I thought it was quite dull. I doubt if I will buy any more of Smith's books, since I have a feeling they are all much more like this one."
5,An action packed adventure,"This is a follow up of the book River God. However, the context is modern Egypt and the characters move in different continents. This an action packed adventure that keeps one glued to the story. Smith has proved again how good a story teller he is."
5,This is one of the best books that I have ever read.,"Wilber Smith creates fasinating characters in the book The Seventh Scroll. With vivid detail, Smith engages the reader into the world of the wealthy and brainy, yet brings them into the world of the Nile. The book reminded me of a Hardy Boy's novel for the big kid in all of us. The entire book is filled with action and passion, while all of the problems that the characters encounter are solved by the use of intellect. This is a true page turner!"
5,Awesome book,This book starts off with a bang(literally) and just gets better from there. The pace is relentless and the sheer storytelling is wonderful. I didn't want the story to end. The ending is anti-climatic but not dull.
5,Wilbur Smith's Best Novel,"Although this book is the sequel to River God, I highly recommend that you read this one first. That is how I started reading the series. I came across this book at the local library and decided to give it a try. What a pleasant surprise it was! I have read many of Smith's novels since then and have found them all enjoyable and engrossing. This one, in my opinion, is his best work.The novel is the story of a young female archaeologists and a wealthy Englishman searching for the clues to a hidden tomb. The hired henchmen of a mysterious and powerful industrialist also want to find the tomb. With these violent men on their heels, the pair sets off to the wilderness of Africa to find the tomb and the valuable artifacts it may contain."
5,seventh scroll,"By now, I have read this book about 4 times which tells you how much I loved it. Smith has written a beautiful, adventerous story about love, greed, death and courage. It takes place in a few different places, starting in Egypt, moving its way to England and then to Ethiopia. Wilbur Smith created wonderful characters, both lovable and detestable. The basic plot of the story is that a tomb found in Egypt reveals seven scrolls, the last scroll containing cryptic clues to the burial site of an ancient king. Two people come together, one a woman from Egypt and a man from England, and struggle against the power and corruption of a lunatic multi-millionare to find the burial site and the treasures that lie within. After reading most of Smiths books to date, I have to say that this is one of my favourite. I really enjoyed this book. Read it; you will not be sorry."
4,"great read, references to self is too conceited","I like Wilbur Smith's writing style.I think he does a great job of creating a compelling fictional story intertwined with plenty of true historical references and with placement in real-life locations and other real-life artifacts.I read the book in about a month of on and off reading and enjoyed the characters.The drawbacks of this author are that: 1) he can name-drop too much in describing the rich lives the characters lead and how they accessorize their material lives, and 2) the most egregious thing about the book is that Wilbur references 'River God,' in the book and himself too. I would never do that and find it offensive that an author needs to actually refer to himself in a fictional novel. That's just tactless and ruins what could be a superlative fictional book.If you don't mind these too much - and I guess I didn't - and love Egyptology, then I'd recommend the book."
3,Not the most interesting of the 3,"Tough going, especially after having read River God.Plough through and then get Warlock.You won't miss much by skipping this book, yet it does answer many of the lingering questions from River God.In Smith's style it moves right along and has a great ending."
5,"""Seventh Scroll"" an excellent read!","Smith is a great story teller: adventures a la Indiana Jones. Hard to put the book down. His description of Ethiopia makes you feel like you can actually see the landscape. You also get a large dose of Egyptian history in the bargain. I've read several of Wilbur Smith's novels, and I think this one is far and away the best!"
4,"Excellent suspense - but his ""River God"" is even better!",Exciting technique of combining history and contemporary times. Good character development. Both interesting and educational. Hope he writes a third in the series
2,Don't buy the Macmillan Audiotape,"The original River God audiotape was superb. The Macmillan Audiotape 3 hour abridged version of ""The Seventh Scroll"" sequel is pale and frustrating. So much has been cut out by the abridgement that much of the story's glory and flow is lost. This edition is a great disappointment."
5,ABSOLUTE MUST READ!!!!,I have read a lot of books in my time and as far as i'm concerned this is the best book ever written.I did NOT want this book to ever end because I was completely enthralled in the adventure of this grand tale.I read this book without having read River God and had no problems understanding anything(but you better believe i'm going to read River God now).If I could speak with Wilbur Smith I would thank him for writing this book which I treasure so very much.
3,really great first 3/4...,"I really liked this book up until the last few pages, now I'm having trouble finishing it. It's totally boring! Some scenes are described in excruciating detail, I found myself flipping to more interesting parts, and I NEVER flip!I'm greatly disappointed with the drawn out plot. I was waiting with great anticipation for the Egyptology, and it's not till the end that anything happens, and it's written in such a way that I'm bored to tears.Maybe this is just me, but I can't picture anything this guy writes. There are some writers that paint such a vivid picture that you feel as though you are there, but Wilbur Smith doesn't do it for me. The only thing that I can picture is the tomb at the end, but it should not take four pages to describe wall art when there is a flood coming and enemy troops bearing down on you! The flow is all mess up! This book took forever to get anywhere, and now that I'm there It's SO dull. It's a pity really!"
3,good. amazing is being generous,"This is a complex album with some songs that are pretty user friendly and some that are not. There are definitely songs I skip. It does smack of pretension at times as with many composers who are trying to create true art. Muhly has scored movies with a skilled hand, so it's clear he knows what he's doing and is making conscious choices, not throwing notes together. That being said, I feel very confident that there are times that the notes are not being played exactly as written, but that there is a fair amount of improv, possibly with the score giving directions as to how to create a certain feeling more than actually defining which notes and where.overall, a good listen. there is a lot of beauty and musicality in this album. sometimes it sounds like the song is playing with itself like a cat and an invisible mouse, that's fun."
1,an album without music,"This is an interesting work of you are looking for a collection of weird sounds. It's really just a bunch of atonal sounds randomly tossed together.For those that think this is some gifted composer baring his soul or something, well, okay... Some will consider this high art. But then some consider a painting of a red square on a black canvas to be worthy of hanging in a museum. Some folks can read all sorts of meaning into something that inherently contains none. If you're that person, this album is for you.For those that aren't art snobs, though, this is an album of odd noises."
5,RIP to Dr.Billy Taylor,i bought this Disc back when it first came out and I always was feeling Billy Taylor's tone on Piano. he truly had a distinctive touch and the arrangements on this album truly capture the directions and tributes. he really had a way of playing and he was heavy handed with his chords and notes. effective and direct and he had style with his playing. very talented and a Great Musician. i enjoyed this album.
2,Not for serious stargazing,"Celestron makes some of the world's greatest telescopes, but this is not one of them. It's fine for peeking into the neighbor's window across the street or looking at the a large, bright object in the sky like the moon. But for serious stargazing, one shouldn't expect much from this telescope or any telescope in this price range. No telescope in this price range is much good for looking at stars or other faint objects. A really good pair of binoculars for around the same price would probably give you more enjoyment and be more versatile. Just lie on the ground and look through both eyes at the moon or constellations, and then take them to the ballgame the next day. And try to get away from city lights. If you do get binoculars, make sure that the second number is at least 7 times the first number (e.g., get 7x50 binoculars, but not 7x35) and that they have fully multi-coated lenses."
5,CoOl!!!!!,"This telescope is soooo cooolllll.when i got it it was amazing. i imediately opened the package.it was great and also light. i looked at the moon once and it was in perfect view. i can see the holes and the ridge terrain of the land. it was amazing!!!! i stared at the moon for an hour and it still fasinates me. when i focus on a bird, you can see the pure feathers on it and their eyes blinking. the finderscope is also very usefull. u can pint point a planet or a star and it will look exactly like it when ur viewing. it is just an wonderful telescope and it's also very cheap."
3,Its just so-so,I wouldn't recommend this. Its very blurry and can't even focus on the cows out in the field let alone all the way to Mars.
5,All nighter!!!,"Menage 'A Way is the sequel to ""A Hood Legend."" Meange is trying to resuce his girlfriend that was kidnapped....The journey is amazing. I really enjoy Victor's style of writing. He is an amazing author as well as a person. I can't wait until his next novel!!"
3,Cute but don't regard it as your bible of companionship,"I found that though this book offered some cute lighthearted insights to relationship astrology, they missed the boat on facts and truly diagnosing a relationship's merit with astrology. There is no mention of the idea that aspects or other parts of the couple's charts will have any importance in the relationship chart, which is simply not true."
3,sexual meanings of planets,"This book explains 144 patterns of Mars/Venus combination in each sign. The focus is on their sexual implication. Their interpretation is quite detailed and each pattern is supported by a case study of celebrity's experience. Hence, I think that this book can be of great use, if you are interested in the sexual meanings of planets, which are usually overpassed in other astrological books."
1,Not what I ordered,"I called ahead to make sure they had the old product formulation left and they said they most certainly did and that's what they would ship.They did not, very frustrating, to what is normally a very good store."
5,The Release of the Spirit,"I love Watchman Nee and his depth of thought. I always look for new books that challenge the way I think about Jesus and the Holy Spirit. And what I have learned since becoming saved and sanctified, is that in order to flow freely in the gifts, or in order to minister effectively; we HAVE to become broken first. Everything about us must be surrendered to the Cross. We must not just have head knowledge, but heart knowledge. We have to become humble and allow the Holy Spirit to work in us, so that ultimately He can shine through us. Excellent book."
5,The Breaking of the Out Man and the Release of the Spirit,"This is one of the best books I have read lately. If you are looking for more of the Lord in your life, this is a book that will bring conviction, will point out at outer attitudes that must die, so then you can experience a deeper intimacy with the Lord. If you want the Lords touch and power to move through your life, if you want to die to fleshly attitudes, you must let God break the outer man so his presence can flow, can be release through you and touch many people in this world that are dying in sin; not with knowledge, but with His Spirit. This book brings you into a deeper relationship with the Lord in such a way that your life won't be the same after reading this book."
2,this is a new translation - look for an earlier edition,"After reading Watchman Nee's excellent book ""Release of the Spirit"" published by Christian Fellowship Publishers, I began searching for a copy to give to a friend. I found ""The Breaking of the Outer Man and the Release of the Spirit"" which I thought was only repackaged and retitled edition, but upon examination I discovered that it is in fact a quite substantial retranslation of the original work by a different publishing house.To me, this new edition has not captured the clarity, directness and frankness I found in ""Release of the Spirit"", and while it may be intended to soften the blow or make the text more reader friendly I find the basic message to be obscured in this new edition. Also, this new edition omits the diagram found in the introduction to ""Release of the Spirit"" which is so helpful and a key to the entire book."
4,VERY SCARY TO THINK SOMETHING LIKE THAT HAPPENED,"THE BOOK WAS VERY INFORMATIVE, THE AUTHOR MADE YOU FEEL AS IF YOU WERE THERE, THE DISASTER WAS TRULY SOMETHING TO THINK ABOUT AS WITH MOST MAJOR CITIES , AS MY OWN WITH PORTS THAT IMPORT EXPLOSIVE AGENTS THAT COULD CAUSE SUCH A DISASTER. I HAVE ALWAYS BEEN INTRIGUE BY THIS STORY, IT WOULD MAKE AN EXCELLENT MOVIE."
4,Little Known Event,I never read about this event in any of my history books. This story of events grips the reader or at least me and had me questioning how things could go so bad. It does not really touch you on an emotional level but more on an intellectual one. The information is all there and is told in matter-of-fact prose. It does not really editorialize and that is what I liked about it.
3,Required for a Class,"Appreciated the idea of first responders, which was the focus of the course and tremendously lacking in this disaster. This occurred during the segregated South and the oil and grime of the explosions made EVERYBODY, black - So humanity forced everyone to do what was right!"
5,Hard to Find,"I bought these for my 80+ mother who is a size 4/6. She is very particular about what she likes ... seamless, cotton crotch, length of short, etc. She was very happy with these briefs. This style is very difficult to find in her size and she was very happy with the result. I would definitely purchase from this vendor again."
2,"Re: Jack Benny 1930 "" The Medicine Man"" movie",Nice funny movie. The quality of it was poor being that it is classic 1930. The still of the frames kept on running up in some spots. Other than that I enjoyed it very much.
3,Faux Japanese,"I ordered this thinking it would be a good collection of Japanese design elements and ideas. I have no problem with mixing different cultural elements and using traditional elements creatively. However, most of what is featured is a sort of faux-Japanese design for yuppies. Items are completely out of place (i.e. a footwarmer used to keep flowrs; clothes hung on walls as decor) and rooms often cluttered. Further, many rooms were cluttered or not very Japanese at all. That said, a few featured houses were nice, and one in particular -- built in rustic Japanese fashion with dark wood -- was beautiful. Overall, unless this is your type of thing, I'd say look elsewhere for design ideas ..."
2,Promising but utlimately disappointing,"If you're like me, then you are revolted by the trivialization of Christian eschatology in popular literature and in fundamentalism. You're also probably longing for a clear, critical theological presentation of the issue. While Kortner certainly offers clarity and other virtues of scholarship, this book is ultimately a disappointment.Kortner provides illuminating discussions of philosophy and theology as it relates to the issue of apocalyptic. Unfortunately, I wasn't able to find much of his own view in the midst of all this summarizing and synthesizing. Moreover, the book lacks the kind of systematic consistency that other works on the subject have, e.g. Brunner's ""Eternal Hope"" or Moltmann's works. Certainly worth reading - but not very satisfying."
2,not what I expected,"I thought this was going to be similar to several other ""Ranger"" books,(like RIP Ford, Jack Hayes) eye witness accounts of Texas history. It is not. It is mostly a list of wanted fugitives with descriptions, with a few hand written notes.Perhaps someone could find juicy footnotes for their family tree.I had some family members of this era, who were reportedly hung for cattle & or horse theft, but found none mentioned."
1,WARNING: RENT BEFORE BUY I REPEAT RENT BEFOE BUY!!!!,"When I first rented the game I was happy. I thought Simpsons great material, how wrong I was. To first start off the graphics are extremely poor. They looked like Sega Gen. graphics. The vision is very fuzzy (or it could be my TV). Next the game play is poor too, the way you move on the screen, you don't have good attacks in the game, and the buttons. The characters are another issue. The voices are okay at best. When they do their ""taunt"" the sayings are really dumb. The weapons each character has is so dumb. It's nothing like the Simpons on TV! There is more but for now I have gave you a sample, I'll make you the judge of the rest. You might like but what I have to say is RENT THE GAME FIRST!!!!!"
1,it is a bad game dont buy it please,"dont buy this game you won't like it at all because it is terrible.it has bad graphics, the people have bad sayings and i didnt like it and neither did my friends. rent it first because you might like it."
4,Simpson's Wrestling,"First,let me say,Its good to have a Simpson's game on the Playstation. And this is a good game,especially for the Simpson's fans. The audio is witty,with lots of dialogue created just for this game. There are many possible charachters. BUT.. There just seems like there was so much more possibility. Why are there no 'out of ring' moves? At the least, you should be able to jump from the top rope,instead of just jumping up and down on a charachter's head. The graphics are a minus,also, not up to usual PSX standards. More for the Simpsons fans,less for the wrestling or general fight game fan"
4,Only Simpsons Fans would understand,"This game is fun if you are a die-hard Simpsons fan! I totally enjoyed seeing the different characters and their signature moves. However, the AI in this game is ruthless, and no matter how hard you play, the computer always wins! I suggest you grab a friend and play this game, human vs. human, because you will have a lot more fun. I am one of the biggest Simpsons fans, and I believe that if you are one, too, you should own this game."
2,They could have made it a classic,"I rented this game from Blockbuster because I knew it could have been either great, or terrible. It was near the terrible line. The graphics weren't great and overall, it just wasn't good enough to be a good game."
1,This Game Is An Insult,Doh! The biggest mistake I ever made in my life is buying this game. It is not Playstation-quality. It is not Super-Nintendo-quality. It is not even Regular-Nintendo-quality. This game is Atari-quality. I played it for about 5 minutes - had no way of returning it - so I gave it away to my little cousin who might be too young to realize how bad it is. The graphics are amazingly bad (broken lines!) and the gameplay is non-existant. My grandmother could make a better game.
1,(...) THE BIG ONE,"22 Characters? More like 16. And It's not even wrestling, it's smacking each other around with pinning. Don't buy it, it'll only kill your love of the simpsons. It only got a star because the dialouges are funny."
3,I love the simpsons,"I'm a big simpsons fan but not the best game player. My boyfriend bought this for me Christmas just because I like the simpsons and I needed a new playstation game. Ok, so it's not anything like ""final fantasy"" or ""tomb raider"", (the only other playstation games I've ever played), but it is quick and easy and a lot of fun if you just want to waste a few hours on a saturday. It's really geared toward simpson fans so if you're not a fan, don't waste your money."
2,The Simpsons!!,"Who doesn't love the Simpsons? I certainly do!! I watch all their episodes (new and old). And what's not to love about them? They're silly, funny, and witty!! I can't say i'm a big Simpsons fan but i am a fan none the less so when i saw they had a wrestling game for playstation, i said i had to get this game!!Well, like some of the Simpsons episodes, this game was disappointing. it wasn't all that interesting and the wrestling moves, i thought, were limited. and it's a very easy game to beat but then again, some of you might like that. In any case, it was still fun for an unchanllenging game. It was only fun for about 10 minutes.I wouldn't recommend this game at all unless you like simple fighting games. And if you are a Simpsons fan, you'll get it anyway regardless whether the game isn't all that."
4,Great pressing,"Though this vinyl is picture disk, the sound of it is great. My only complaint is that when I ordered it from amazon, the description made me think that this is the new ""re-loaded"" vinyl version, but it wasnt, I got the picture disk version instead. Good to see that amazon.com have fixed the description by now."
5,Body Builder,"I love this DVD. All though this wasn't my first time purchasing it, I would recommend it to any woman or man trying to get in the best shape of their life. I like having the ability to customize my workout. I can do all of the exercise or just one. It depends on how I feel, but it's wonderful. You will be able to feel the burn and the pain with each exercise you do. I am glad the I purchased this DVD again. Thanks!"
3,"It's ok, if you can get past the cheesy instructors","I had this one for about a year and couldn't stand the instructors any longer and sold it on Craig's List. I found them to be very cheesy, and found the exercises to be basics that I can do on my own. I was hoping for some innovative moves and also wanted some cardio, but just didn't find that. I think this would be good for those looking for specific areas to tone, with little time in their day to to so."
4,perfect for moms,"This dvd is great if you need to breakup your workout into little bits. I am home with a baby and sometimes she won't let me finish an entire workout so this is really good because you can just do 10, 20 or 30 minutes at a time. Not much on here cardio wise but a really good tone up type of workout."
3,TotalMix - The Complete Total Body Workout System,"This DVD provides a balanced workout covering all problem areas. The dialogue is a little too cute but the exercises are easy to follow. The best part, it's a mix and match DVD enabling you to execute 10-30 minutes worth of body toning in any or all three areas."
4,Quick and easy toning,"This DVD offers 9 different 10 minute workouts that work all major muscle groups. Is a great DVD for days when you don't have much time (can do a quick 10 minute workout) or when you have a lot of time (can do an entire hour of lifting). Is great for people who don't like to do the same movements for extended periods of time. Quick 10 minute sessions allow you to focus on the muscle groups of your choice (i.e. buns workout) then follow with an entirely different session, such as abs or arms. These are toning and firming exercises, not going to build bulky muscles."
5,2 grandmas think this is the BEST,"I'm over 50. My neighbor is almost 65. We do an abs, a buns, and a legs or arms two or three mornings a week depending on our work schedules. We love our ""three ladies"" and the way we can choose workouts to fit our time and/or excercise needs. Since we've heard the ladies' chatter so much we don't like it anymore, but that doesn't stop us from following the instructions and using the dvd. Maybe its easy for all you under 30's out there, but we find it quite challenging. We have other tapes, and can recommend the 10 minute solution... but very few others."
5,Best Fitness DVD,"I am an avid health freak. I exercise, eat healthy and stay in great physical health. I have been exercising consistently for over 15+ years. Recently I bought this DVD after reading its great reviews. I am a follower! This is the best exercise DVD I have ever bought and I use it ALL the time. It's so fun! It's challening for someone that exercises regularly, but not so difficult that I feel I don't want to do it even on a blah day. It is just long enough and not too long that even having a 2 year old and working full time I am able to do it everyday and even look forward to the next day! I recommend this for everyone- even those who don't enjoy exercising and don't do it often, this may just change your attitude!"
5,Gets to the point,Pluses: Tough enough to challenge a solid intermediate; all the segments are different; Minna Lessig; the DVD provides the ability to set up any combination of up to 3 out of the 9 10-minute segments; generally useful editorial tips during the exercises from the 3 leads.Minuses: 3 buns segments and only 1.5 for each of arms and legs (2/2/2 would have been preferable); occasional prattle between the 3 leads.
5,Great DVD because it is flexible,I like this DVD because:1) Each 10 minute segment has a ten minute time down counter. So you know how long exactly you have to go (and how much energy you can use up)2) I like the fact that you can pick any of the 9 workouts (each 10 minutes). Basically mix and match. Or if you like a certain routine do it several times over.Great Idea. (Especially for people who have to start slow and can't do a whole hour at once)
4,"Clear, concise, and effective","This is an excellent workout DVD if you are looking for something to strengthen and tone specific areas. I love the fact that I can choose between three half-hour workouts focusing on the abs, buns, or arms and legs; OR mix and match three different 10-minute segments of my choosing. All three instructors are clear and concise, and the exercises are varied and interesting. None of them are very difficult but they are all effective. The time flies by since everything is done in 10-minute periods. I highly recommend this DVD."
2,Not Very Challenging,"I was disappointed with this DVD after reading all the reviews on it. The exercises may be ok for beginners, but for anyone else, don't expect to see results. There are not enough repetitions of each excercise and they just seem totally useless. There also is not much explaining or warm up, so some of the ab and bun excersices could cause some back problems. The dialogue is much too cutesy. I would suggest Tamilee Webb's ""I Want That Body"" instead. You can do hers in 15 minute segments and you will see results. They are more difficult, but at least you're not wasting your time and risking injuring yourself!"
4,This low impact work-out is wonderful!,"You don't need to be in shape already to start this program. You just need to have at least 10 minutes a day and a DVD player.I hate working out, but it's a necessary evil. For years, I've been looking for a fun work-out that isn't lead by an annoying ex-cheerleader-type, and isn't just a lot of ineffective dance moves (or Richard Simmons). This fits the bill perfectly! The routines are easy to follow, the women are energentic and encouraging, but not annoying, and it's difficult to get bored with over 100 different combinations to try.Even though it seems like the segments are low-impact and moving slowly, you'll find yourself working up a sweat and wondering where that last 10 minutes went. I recommend this DVD for anyone - male or female - looking for a good work-out that will keep you motivated."
5,Great system!,"This DVD is great. The only problem I have with it is the menu you use to customize your workout is a little confusing. It'd be nice to have some instructions for it. I'm sure I'll figure it out though.The workout segments themselves are great. I used it for the first time last night and did one ab session and one bun session. I'm really feeling it this morning, and I workout almost everyday. The moves are very different than your typical sit ups, crunches, etc. but are not hard to follow. The instructors are motivating but not annoying. I'm definitely going to keep my eyes open for more Quick Fix DVDs, I think I'll try their Yoga/Pilates DVD next."
2,For Beginners,"After all the great reviews I read on this item, I was so disappointed when I finally got it. I would consider myself advanced in terms of cardio but low intermediate in terms of strengths. Even with that, however, I did not find this DVD challenging at all. I'm sorry I bought it."
4,Good Short Add-ONs,"The box loooks cheesy but the workouts are actually pretty good. I hate cardio and most gym style workout but have used the ab set (always need more work on my abs) often as a quick add-on to my regular workouts for maintenence. Its very short and It's not so tough that I find myself avoiding it.Overall, I think this is a really useful DVD to have. It's hard to find short add-ons that are good for any level."
2,Don't waste your money!,This video has three 10 minute segements. Each has a warm up period and cool down- so it doesn't leave that much time for actual exercise. The exercises weren't challenging enough to feel like I was getting much of a workout.
5,Quick Fix TotalMix Does Work!!!,"I got this cool dvd on Friday evening...pop it in...start my session. First, i have no idea if this is going to work or not so i might as well give it a try since i already bought it. Work through the legs session all i can say is.. wow...i feel the burn. Then on Saturday...work on the abs session of this DVD...after finished...relax for about 20 mins...then took a look in the mirror...and WOW..incredible. My abs are more lean and i can feel my abs section got tighter. Everyone should try this ""TotalMix""-Quick Fix and see the great results for yourself. It really does WORK! Just like me, lets start a new commitment together for this new year. Take care, have fun, and enjoy your great new looking body!"
1,TOO CHEESY,"Mina Lessig is an nnoying Denise Austin type. She tries soooooo hard at being cute or sexy that she BUGS ME immensly. Nancy Popp is good, but the workouts don't do it for me, they are repetitive and cumbersome. i'd recommend anything else."
4,A toning favorite,"I've had this dvd for a few years and it's one of my favorites for strength training/toning. I'm only giving it 4 stars because there's nothing for chest or back. Also, there's too much set-up for some of the exercises. After you've watched it numerous times it's a little annoying to hear the slow, deliberate instructional set-up over and over again. I'd rather them speed it up and as a beginner you can just watch a few times if you need the instruction. Nevertheless the workouts are fun and effective, with some unique moves. And it's great to be able to mix and match your workouts. You won't be bored!"
4,I Love This Video!,"I must say that this is the best work-out video I have ever bought. It is broken down into 3 sections, Abs, Buns, and Arms & Legs. Each section has 3 ten minute work outs to choose from and you can customize your own work-out by picking from any of the 9. There is a clock on the side of the screen that counts down the 10 minutes and the instructors are great. I highly recommend this video to anyone who is looking to have their butt kicked!"
4,Good,"Great for a quick work out. Arms, abs and legs workouts can be combined, I don't get bored with it. I recommend it highly."
4,Fun Workout Supliment,"I really like customizing my workout, and that I have the choice to spend 30 - 90 minutes on my workout. The movements may seem easy at first, however if you really concentrate on the muscle groups you are working, you will feel that encouraging burn. I don't think this will take the place of my regular strength training, however I don't feel guilty cutting a run short because of the weather, when I can come inside and hang out with Minna, Julie, and Nancy for however long I choose. I recommend this DVD as a suppliment to cure any boredom that may be occuring in your current workout schedule."
3,"Just a copy of ""Delphi 4 Unleashed"", too bad!","If not the difference between Object Pascal and C++, this book is the same as ""Delphi4 Unleashed"", a must for Delphi programmers. So, this book seems at most a translation version of Delphi4 Unleashed, by just translating the sample code from OP to C++. If you've already owned the Delphi one, don't buy this one! Anyway, the content is peerless as it's nearlly the same as that of exellent book ""Delphi4 Unleashed""."
4,Most Chapters are excellent...but,"While most of the chapters in the book are excellent, there are some exceptions. For example, the chapters on databases leaves far too much to be explained. The author spends too much time describing some elegant ( but unnecessary ) bits of code and skip the basic notions of how you tie everything together."
4,crazy mix!,"Zabiela is incredible live and this CD can't fully capture the experience. With that being said, JZ nicely mixes in tech house, breaks and prog into an energetic mix. I especially liked the overlay of space manouvres - stage one onto the breakbeat track.can't wait for his new rennaissance mix!"
2,does not capture JZ's talents,"I have seen James Zabiela live a few times and the guy is amazing. He might be the most talented DJ out there right now. His track selection, scratching and general energy level are really extraordinary. So why does this CD set by him suck so much? It is just boring. Plods along and goes nowhere."
1,No good,I struggled if I could rate more stars. I love Stephen Foster's music but I do not recommend this CD.
5,A great way to discover or REdiscover Foster's music,"I received this CD as a XMas gift, and I was already familiar with most of the songs. The performances and arrangements are terrific, and including both a vocal and an instrumental version of Angelina Baker was a great idea! The liner notes are wonderful, too!"
5,Great Stylus,"I was using Sketchbook Pro with my finger, I thought there had to be an easier way. Research online show this to be the best. I have used friends and when you tilt them to draw they seem like they'll scrape up your screen. This one has a head that tilts without the scraping and doesn't wear out so quickly. Love it!"
4,fun,"Another great title from land before time serie. kids love racing against each other, and that makes me happy as a parent. try also Valley Adventure, it is even better and you will save baby sitter money."
2,Run Run Run!!! little saurus!,It looks like a lot of fun on the outsidebut once you bring it home and try it...well.I bought it and played it and was disappointedbecause it's hard to play the levels. you'd thinkthere's time to think but you have to keep runningthat makes it tough. Also the levels are short and too easyYou should rent it at blockbuster or somwherefirst. But if you like The Land Before Time a lotyou would probably like this a lot. (maybe)
5,Fantastic guide.,"This manual is a somewhat more consise version of Dr. White's Osteology textbook. Excellent for anyone with any need to understand the human skeleton in depth. Clearly and assessibly written and includes fantastic pictures, indexes of directional terms, etc. Used widely on archaeological digs the world over."
5,Excellent,The book came in perfect condition within a few days of ordering! I was very pleased with the prompt delivery!
3,What is what?,"Credit must be given to the poet for openly acknowledging that this work contains both rants and poems. However, excepting the entries that use occasional awkward rhymes schemes, it is not always clear what is rant and what is poem. Also, some of the entries are prosaic and lack emotional intensity to be rant-like or the syntactical intensity characteristic of poetry.I did find the poet's concerns sympathetic and I appreciated his attempt to give his anarchistic point of view poetic expression. Yet poetry lies in more than an expression of belief. It also lies in its execution and with a few exceptions that seems to be dominant struggle in this work."
2,Died a year later,I used it as a backup battery. It worked fine before it died although the battery life is not as long as the original one. Hey it was cheap.
5,************Brilliant**********,"I loved the great descriptions, pictures, and all the wonderful details included in this great book!"
5,I loved it,I loved this book I looked at it 4 times ! It was wonderful its so neat great for Beanie Lovers I love the Dream Beanies they are so creative and the poems are great ! They tell a little bit about them Just the right amount of info for all you beanie Lovers out there . :D Lyndsay
4,Pretty Good,"I think it is good and colorful, except I knew everything in it! I thought it was kind of a waste of money but it was fun."
4,"decidedly Korean, and subtly American","from CD Roots: A rare mix of traditional Korean music with a modern American sensibility that includes Robert Dick on flutes; Thomas Buckner, baritone; National Living Treasure Chung Jae-Guk, Park Jong-Sol and Yang Myung-Sok on piri; as well as Joseph Celli playing the oboe and English horn. With this new release, Jin Hi Kim champions the cause of cross-cultural communication through four unique compositions that skirt, weave and dart across and between Asian-American microtonal sound chambers. The results are at once spiritual, artistic and illuminating--decidedly Korean, and subtly American. Jin Hi Kim's LivingTones ushers in a new era of East-West aesthetic understanding through the creation of a new place where subcultural investigations are allowed occur and grow freely."
5,No Flair Or Entertainment......Just Pure Gospel,"Classic Tozer on tape! Play this in the car and go for a long drive....worth several listens and more. Boy, could this man hammer a point home and you know, he needed too. When finishing a book or tape of his, one is greatly reminded of the urgent message of the Gospel.....and the fact that we really do need to ""count your days like blades of grass"". This was recorded in 1954, but like the Gospel on which it is firmly fixed, it is absolutely timeless."
2,The effect of arginine,"This company's minerals were recommended by a source I trusted, but not this particular product. I was using arginine as a way of lowering blood pressure. Getting a sufficient amount is hard, lots of pills or poor-tasting powder mixed into drinks. There was a definite effect with other forms of arginine, although timing and the length of the effect varied.With this product, I noticed no effect at all. I took most of the bottle, but the morning dose, taken as suggested, simply did not seem to produce any effect on my blood pressure."
3,Got Arginine?,"The product may work as advertised - however, my taste buds objected and I have had to force myself to drink it. So Sorry!"
3,Got Arginine,"I have used a similar product that had a better taste. However, for the price and some juice this product works like nitro to open arteries. I use it to help lower my blood pressure and to recover after exercise."
4,Small but mighty,"The message that is. I didn't know what to expect when I got this little Bible, but it is a very nice little Bible. I also own the Cambridge Wide Margin Goatskin Bible as well & I was thinking it would be along those lines. It's not of the same quality, but still very good. The inside lining could be glued to the cover better though, especially along the edges. That's really my only complaint about this Bible. The print is small, but it's a small Bible! I carry it everywhere I go in a small case along with Bible tracts. That's the reason I got it, to be able to have something with me to use as a witnessing tool, to answer any questions about the tracts."
4,hummers like it,"Easier to clean than most hummingbird feeders, but eventually grew mold anyway, even after weekly cleanings."
2,Over analytical,"I expect an author taking on a tough subject to find the nuggets of truth and explain them clearly. This author didn't rise to the task. Perhaps writing about stand hunting for a nationwide audience is too much to ask. But, if an author tries, I expect him to get it before publishing. On the upside, if you have no prior knowledge, and you find yourself in the authors stands, his advice will prove priceless."
3,Can buy this book for under $4...won't go out of print,You can buy this book at Shanghai Online Bookstore for less than $4.00 USD. It will not go out of print.
3,This is NOT a collectible!,"It's an OK book and it was written long times ago... People is buying this book recently thought this is a collectible as Fend and Chen ""normally"" wouldn't write book together anymore. Some people thought this book is out of print and might became a collectible... This book was reprinted in 1995 and 1999... ;-) I have a few of this book (printed in 1984) and thought they won't print it anymore too. Well, at least I only paid $5.00 USD when I bought mine then. You can buy a brand new one for $3.30 USD(yes, three dollars and thirty cents)from Amazon China."
3,For Experienced Chen Players Only..,"This is an inspirational book for me, dusted off a few times a year, with lots of photos of martial applications of the Chen long form and cannon fist. Be advised though, this is not a ""how to do taiji"" book, apart from a rudimentary section on the 38 Step at the back of the book. The focus is primarily on fighting applications of the Chen style. If you already study Chen this is worth having. If not, look elsewhere."
4,"Nice, but heavy","Just a short review here. Well made leash - but do be aware that it is **heavy**. Have had numerous chain leashes in the past and the thin ones like this were not this heavy. So if you're getting it for a small dog or small pup who chews leashes, just beware that it's got some pretty good weight to it."
4,Pretty good!,"My only complaint is that the clip that hooks to the collar is very small, we use a harness that has two loops to attach the armholes together at the back, and this clip cannot fit them. We had to buy a small carabiner as an extension of sorts... but other than that this is a very high quality leash!"
4,Dog Leash,Perfect size for my small dog. Had to buy her a metal leash because she likes to chew the regular leashes. 4ft long is just about perfect.
3,Way too expensive for the product,"This manual is a general manual and does not go beyond the obvious regarding assembly and disassembling Model A systems. The photos are dark and not very clear and the price on Amazon is way too expensive for what you are getting. There are other sources such as the on-line antique car parts dealers, who sell this book and other related books for much less. I purchase almost everything I can through Amazon, but this product is priced at a ridiculous level."
3,It's OK,"There are better books for the Ford Model A restorers. OK general information, but is dated based on more substantial books"
5,1932,I bought this as a present for my brother. He is in the process of restoring a 1932 and he said this book helped him a lot.
3,Not as great as it could be.,"I was greatly looking forward to this game until I saw the screenshots on Acclam.com. The screenshots do not look as great as they could, and as a lacrosse fan that greatly disapoints me. Will I buy this game yes, and why, so that video game companys will see that their is a market for lacrosse video games in the future. And as to all those people who say that they should have made a field game, personaly since I play both I believe that they made the right choice in making it box. Box is much faster and better suited for the arcade action that accliam was looking for. I only wish that accliam spent a little more time in development and published it for the playstaion 2, but oh well."
1,Gameplay Review,"Well, I got ahold of Blast Lax today, and I was sorely disappointed. This game is horrendous. Gameplay is weak, checks are dumb, and it looks like it was written by a bunch of morons that have never played. Its so hard to even make a successful pass. Game is so fast that its hard to tell what is happening at first. Commentary is really nerdy, and there's even a button for Cross-Check...(sigh). This is hardly a rentable."
2,"Not Such A ""Blast"" Lacrosse","Blast LAcrosse, although enjoyable for the fact it's the most recent lacrosse game, is rather annoying and frustrating. In tournament mode, the CPU is so extraordinary difficult to beat, you almost wonder why you bothered to play. The graphics are not great by any means, even for a PS1 game, and the controls and gameplay are difficult to get the hang of.Words of Wisdom: dont buy this game unless you want to be in for one of the most difficult challenges the video game industry has to offer."
2,Blast Lacrosse,"This game is terrible. It's cartoon violence makes it seem like a looney tune game. It is very unrealistic. The people that say it is good are drunk or afraid to tell the truth. With as much hitting as it has without penalties, it looks like a game that a bunch of drunk 11 year olds would play on the playground without any teachers. I rate this game a 2 because it is ammusing for about ten minutes(that's how long it takes to load the game)."
4,Blast at Last,"A long wait is about to get a little longer. Although Blast is a Lacrosse based game, it falls short on giving those who know the game the game we have been waiting for. The game is fun to play, it is pretty cool to see a Lacrosse goal and control the great players of the MLL. Game play is pretty fast making the flow of the game difficult. You don't get to hold the ball very long before your head is ripped off. You can do some quick stick and other real life plays. I would suggest buying this game, don't get me wrong.Hopefully this is a prelude to an improved field version, on the PS2 please."
3,Time to Update,"Yo this game could be off the chain with all the new gamin technology out. Put some cats on the Blast 2 project for PS2 and you'd have a top-selling game. Lax is growing in the US and the people with Playstation should take advantage of it. Also, they should put more research into the game cause they left out some really important parts of the game, like dodging. This game could have a lot of potential."
3,"Horrible graphics, but I will give them 3 stars for trying","I am very disappointed at the quality of graphics. We need to get EA Sports to make a lax game. This game falls short in a lot of areas. The gameplay is OK, but they should have put this on the PS2 and added outdoor MLL, and maybe the top 20 college teams. That would improve the gameplay, graphics and options. I agree with another reviewer that the graphics are super nintendo level."
3,Nice try,"Well I have waited 17 years for a game like this and it hasn't quenched my thirst so to speak. The graphics are a la super nintendo, in fact the players look like robots, it doesn't follow the rules of lacrosse and everybody is left handed. All these things being said, and Im sure I could go on, you still must go out and buy this even if you use it as a coaster! We have to let them know that lacrosse games can sell, then perhaps we can pick and choose between different games like those other inferior sports. Lax rules, but this game doesn't. My final thought is actually a question. Who consulted these guys on this game a professional wrestler and Ruprecht the Monkey Boy? Sorry Acclaim but with as far as we have come with video games you guys brought us back to Atari. In fact the guys run along side one another like the old square headed Atari football. You know what I am talking about if your first stick was an SL2, Sam, or Laser Lite. Viva Old School."
3,Not what I expected....,"I have been playing lacrosse for about 5 years, and when I saw that they were coming out with a lacrosse game I had to get it. I preordered it and it came in the mail today. The graphics are not very good, along with the gameplay. I figured the game would be really good compared to most of the recent games that have come out for playstation, instead it looks like something that could have come out the first year of playstation. The only reasons I gave it 3 stars is because it is lacrosee....and because its fun for a little while."
2,Very Very Disapointed,I was very disapointed when i played this game. The other person is write it is almost like a wrestling game. If you get touched by some1 u fly 100 feet in the air. Its a WRESTLING GAME! If i were u i would rent it to try it out. I should have renteded it!
3,Gameplay Disappoints but Buy it to Send a Message,"As one other reviewer already remarked, this game is like WWF meets NLL; The game barely resembles a regualtion NLL game, if at all. In one of the game modes, the objective is to incapacitate all of the players on the other team! And the graphics are terrible, so much so that it is sometimes difficult to see your own men (especially in ""On Fire"" mode).With that said, I still encourage you to buy this game. Why, you ask? Because if this game proves to profitable for Acclaim, then maybe other companies like EA will get the hint and produce a real lacrosse game. As others have said, I would love to see a EA Sports, FIFA-like outdoor lacrosse game. And with the PS2 now available, I think they could make an excellent looking game.So, while the gameplay is terrible and the graphics are worse, real lacrosse enthusiasts will still get a kick out of playing Blast Lacrosse."
4,First ever Lacrosse game!!!!,Finally the best sport in the world has a video game!I'm not sure how this game will be the graphics will probably suck but its a lacrosse game so im sure it wil be a blast to play.This game should bring new fans to the sport and maybe EA Sports will make an outdoor lax game for PS2.
5,Firstlook - Screenshots and movies,"The first-ever lacrosse video game BLASTS its way onto the PlayStation game console with non-stop 5-on-5 arcade action that checks you right into the boards!Officially licensed by the National Lacrosse League.All 9 NLL teams featuring official player rosters, team uniforms and full season play.Feel the intensity of professional indoor lacrosse with board-checks, stick-checks and the intense Turbo Check!Quick Pick-Up-and-Play control features like Turbo and On-Fire let you hit harder, run faster, jump higher and perform incredible special moves.8 stick-shattering game modes including: Sudden Death, Survivor, Last Man Standing and Tournament!Player attributes include: Speed, Shot & Pass Power, Shot Accuracy, Strength & Weight.Over the top color commentary by national sports talk radio host Scott Farrell.Full Game Stats give you tale of the tape for goals, assists, shots on goal, save percentage, body checks and time of possession."
1,Maybe hope for the future...,"I'm a big box Lax fan and was very excited to see a Lax game come out. However, it seems that all Acclaim did was get the rights to the team names and players and just made the rest up! Everyone is left handed, there should be 6 players (including the goalie) from each team on the field, there's only 9 players on each team, it doesn't keep stats, the hits are grossly exaggerated, there's no penalties, and to top it all off, where is the GAME CLOCK?!?! There is absolutley no way to tell how much time is left except for when there's 3 seconds left and it beeps! I just hope this game was put out to test the Lax market. Help us EA Sports! Please?!"
5,Best LaCrosse Game ever !!,"This game ROCKS !!! Yesterday, I played this game for 6 hours straight. AI is simply amazing. I couldn't feel my fingers afterwards. Forget about PS2, Xbox or GC... Good old PSX has a winner."
3,keep the faith,"all you guys who hate this game, RELAX we all know it could have been better, we all know we need EA to do it right, but don't hate on our (lacrosses) 1st game!! remember the NHL for sega that EA did, the 1st one? no stats, and really weak, but it was hockey man!! so now we're finally up to bat with laxs 1st game and some of you guys act like the world owns us a game!!! yo shut up, support the fact that our community finally is getting some props for being a real sport(remember curling is an olympic sport, lax isn't) and support this thing so it gets bigger! i love the fact i have the gaits and other guys i grew up watching on my PS1! if i was acclaim i wouldn't have spent 20 mill. making the greatest lax game ever if i was making the 1st one!! i would test the market, and once i found out how strong it was, then i would give the people what they want! look at how that rugby game fell off the map! if you don't support our game, we will fall off too......"
3,Below expectations,"Originally when I saw that a lacrosse game was finally on the market, I couldn't wait to get my hands on it....Well it turns out that... I thought the game is average at best, with blockly graphics, few statistics, and just too many improvements that could have occurred. In conclusion, I'm happy that there is finally a lacrosse game available, but agree that the next lacrosse game that I purchase will hopefully be by [another company] and hopefully will be the outdoor field version. Thanks for reading."
1,a sad sad day,I was so excited when i heard about this game. I have played lax for years. I would buy any lax game. This is the worst game I have ever played. Did the programers do any research? Why are all the players left handed? Why does the commintator only say 5 things? I hope this doesn't ruin the chance of a good outdoor lacrosse game (EA did you hear that?)
1,bright! - hopefully issue will be resolved!,"My husband is very happy with his christmas gift! It is like a spotlight, the last one we had was ruined due to batteries exploding, so it was actually a good thing we got to upgrade to the led.Update: the first time we actually used it to clean out the fireplace it got very dim. I am returning it and hoping the next one isn't damaged!"
5,Boy do I love this flashlight... A+++++,"this is a no frills flashlight. It runs on 2 D cell batteries like a real flashlight should. The LED light is bright - both LED and standard bulbs are included. I love the abilty to focus the beam on a narrow spot to look for a noise maker downstairs, or use the broad flood light effect for walking through the neighborhood at night. The flashlight is aluminum, has a nice weight -- but not too heavy. It looks like it will last a lifetime. I just have to keep the Orkin guy from taking it with him....like he did my last flashlight :("
5,Great flashlight!,"This was one of my proudest purchases. Not only did it show up two days early, but it arrived in perfect shape and works amazingly great. This is without a question the best flashlight I own and I own a lot. Before I bought this flashlight I bought a regular, incandescent, 2 d-cell Mag-lite and was very happy with it. Now that I own a Mag-lite LED, the incandescent Mag-lite looks like a toy. This LED Mag-lite is SUPER BRIGHT with a very impressive range. It is very much like a miniature spotlight. It is very durable and the metallic gray finish is just plain sexy. I added a couple pics of the flashlight because the stock pic from Amazon is a little misleading, the actual flashlight is darker (more like a charcoal finish). Even though the finishes are different, I was not disappointed in any way. I love this flashlight and plan on ordering more."
4,"Like every maglite these days, but in a rare color","Good maglite. The LEDs are a big step up from the older halogen type of bulb.LED takes it from a yellow light to a more bluish/whiter lite. And the range seems a bit further.As for the rest of it, the big news is this color. Otherwise, it's like the normal black maglite you see. I've never seen the red before, it's what caught my eye. I don't know the color process of how they make it, but the red isn't scratching off, so it's not ""painted"" on top. The red is definitely more part of the metal."
3,Bright in the beginning...,"It appears that Maglite as of right now are lagging behind in technology due to the lack of modern flashlights in their product lineup. Such flashlights would include features like:-Rechargeable & removable lithium or nickel packs-Steady light supply via current, temp & voltage regulation controls-Internal power plantIt comes with a bright LED light but you STILL have to ""smack"" it on the bottom to correct the internal mis-contact to restore its brightness. The charge using ""Energizer"" & ""Duracell"" batteries doesn't last that long; It begins to dimm quickly!Very disappointed with Maglite, however an awesome American company.Other things noticed -After about 5 minutes of use LED will begin to lose its lumens (as if tired). This is common with high tensity LED technology for some reason."
3,Color in picture is totally wrong!!!!,"I ordered this because I need a LIGHT-COLORED Maglight, but when it arrived, it was actually a very DARK gray color, nothing like the silver that is depicted in the photo. I am not reviewing the quality of the flashlight because I didn't even open it- just wanted to advise that the color is nothing like what is pictured."
2,Really big!,"It's hard to tell from the picture, but this flashlight is really big. Too big for our purposes. Would be great if it were smaller."
4,A proper and bright flashlight,"This is a proper flashlight, it's nice to hold, feels well made, and is very bright. Metallic body feels good quality. Adjustable light focus by rotating flashlight head is a useful feature. It's a 5-star product, but I'm giving it 4.5 stars only because in certain focus levels, a dark spot appears in the middle of the light pattern.Highly recommended."
5,absolutely fantastic,"my husband wanted a second maglite flashlight, but it soon became mine, i love the color and it works great, fast shipping, cant buy a better flashlight"
5,LED Maglite,The new Maglites offer a quantum leap in light output over the previous generation of non LED lights. I am impressed and may convert some older Maglites to LED since the upgrade part is a simple install
5,The light that does not fail,"This is not my first Maglite, nor will it be me last. We bought it because it is smaller than our 6 cell, and we needed something handier with which to walk the dog while holding a leash and a poop bag. This fills the bill perfectly. Love the LED bulb...casts a great light light, and is easy on batteries."
5,Algo Diferente,"Es un disco diferente a los anteriores. Conocí a este grupo principalmente por el estilo de interpretar canciones en forma de popurrí. El ritmo, el arreglo y el enlace de sus voces hace un placer disfrutar estas melodias simples y expresivas. Abarcaron diferentes géneros en la interpretación de varios estilos de música: bolero, cha cha cha, ranchera y tango; los presentaron a diferentes generaciones con el mismo éxito."
5,"Slim, lightweight, and powerful","So far, this product has been terrific. I am going to Spain for two weeks and I look forward to putting it to work. I have been using it over the last week to make sure it works and I have been pretty happy with it. The only problem (not anything major) is the way that it clips to the iPod. First, I have to remove my case. However, I do not remove the clear screen overlay protector and the clip causes the screen overlay to bubble a little. The big test will be over the next few weeks."
4,"Wonderful for iPod 5G, not perfectly suitable for iPhone/Touch","The charger delivers on its promise of quick, powerful charging and battery backup for the iPod 5G (Classic). I was more than pleased with its performance. However, note that it is not designed for all-around use on the iPhone/iPod Touch. The fit for those products is less than ideal. Also, one cannot use the headphone jack when chargling the iPhone/iPod Touch. That said, on long flights (over 5 hours), this unit provides the necessary to juice to get your iPod up and running again!"
5,Excellent!,"Nice, well-designed external battery. Excellent capacity. Compact and lightweight. On a recent trip, charged my video 60 gb and Mini Ipod and had more power to spare. Battery power indicator very useful."
1,Don't trust your iPod Touch 4G with this product!,"This product claims to be compatible with the iPod Touch 4G. While you can plug your iPod Touch into the socket that's about where the compatability ends.The main problem is the holder; even with the included rubber spacer my iPod Touch 4G still sits loosely in the holder and falls out at the first opportunity.An additional problem is that the holder easily separates from the battery, rendering the expected lifetime of your iPod Touch to the amount of time that it takes for the holder to separate from the battery and hit the floor.Others seem to have had more success with this product...but it's not designed to work with the iPod Touch 4G. Too bad...it's a good concept and I hope someone makes something that will be more compatible in the future."
4,"starts slow, but gets better","I admit I started watching for Courteney Cox, since I was a big fan of ""Freinds"". I was pleasantly surprised to see Christa Miller (from ""Drew Carey"") and Busy Phillips (from ""Dawson's Creek"") as well.The first few episodes leave a lot to be desired, but after that it turns into an amazing series that is great to watch with that someone special."
5,Cougar Town Season 1,"Great show...funny, witty...and the entire cast is superb! Highly recommend! So glad TBS picked this up after ABC canceled it."
5,Great Sitcom!,This is such a good show and the DVD did not disappoint. The service was great and it arrived before the specified date to arrive. I was very pleased with everything.
4,love the show!,"I rarely buy dvd's anymore but I watched this show and loved it - I had to have it in my collection. I wanted more in the gag reel, but as the show is so funny it's better they use their material in that than in the extra's!"
1,Looks cool,"Product looks cool, very consistant in that it drops connections on a frequent basis, range is not what one would think with something that is being touted as top of the line."
1,Stick with Linksys G,"Planned on buying a linksys wireless G router and separate access point to fix wireless gaps in the house .. was convinced to buy an N .. a buffalo N despite reading the write-ups on their problems .. geek told me N is the only way to go .. My wireless range decreased and my DSL throughput was 3-5 times less than with my current B router !! needless to say, I'm going back to my original G plan ... and will stick to Linksys"
5,I love it.,"I'm not a C&W fan but when a friend offered to take me to a Patty Loveless concert, I figured what the heck. These guys were her opening act and I loved it. Just two guys, two guitars, talent, and energy. Not only were their harmonies excellently rendered but they were obviously having a genuinely good time, not just putting on smiles for the audience. When they did a raucous version of ""Between the Stones and Jones,"" I was sold. I still am. My only critricism - and it's a very small one - is that I wished the CD had a track or two that was like the concert I saw: No backing, no orchestra, just them, their guitars, and their wonderful harmonies."
5,Its a masterpiece,Kelly (Shiver)has been a great friend of mine. I can feel honored now to have Kelly to back me up at the annual Country Christmas' in our hometown. Look for more of Kelly's work coming soon as he is back to writing.
3,Alright.... I guess,"Setup was long and rather complex, lots of unplugging and replugging. But, I got it done. The software that comes with it is weird, not the easiest to use, in fact I can't even get them to work. Just viewing it through your web browser is good though, and you can view it through third party software, I'm using Web Cam Pro from by Datashare, but it doesn't get the full framerate.The nightvision/low light isn't that great. It gets more than my minidv camcorder, but isn't enough to actually see details. Supposedly there are lens attachments you can buy to improve this... so the camera is more lowlight upgrade ready, rather than lowlight capable."
4,Dressing the Man,"Very solid book for any man that cares about style. Maybe not the very best (in my opinion), but definitely a classic."
5,Dressing the Man: Mastering the Art of Permanent Fashion,This was just the book I needed when I decided to update my wardrobe after fifteen years on neglect. Perfect for learning or re-learning the basics.
2,Dated and irrelevant,"If you're an American who aspires to dress like a 1940s matinee idol then this book is for you. If not, probably best to look elsewhere."
5,very helpful,"full of insights and tips, I found (and find) this book a big help in getting me dressed well and buying clothes well. From the basic elements of design for individual body types and colorations - to fabrics and shoe styles, I found this a most practical book. For a guy that really has, er, well had, no fashion sense at all (that would be me) it is a god send."
4,It's good info.,"While the book does give ideas as to what would look good with your particular build, height, and skin tonealong with keeping clothes in proportion to your physique, which is crucial, I feel it goes a little todeep into the history of the different styles of clothes. I would like to have seen the reverse, moreinformation and examples placed on the different colors, patterns, and styles based on a persons build and skintone and less amount on the history of the garment style."
2,There is a Better Source for Sartorial Splendor,"Gentlemen, trust me. Fluisser's book is nicely photographed, but it is not the final word on correct dress. There is a better book, all around. It is by Bernhard Roetzel, and it is called, ""Gentleman: A Timeless Fashion."" I am an American who has traveled a great deal in Europe and Asia. Trust me, this is the textbook. You will find it on display in the epicenters of finality regarding man's dress, Bond Street, Savile Row, London. The photos are great, and the advice given by Roetzel is, unlike Flusser, not ethnocentric to America. It works like crazy in America, but also works in other countries. Flusser is a Hollywood maven. Roetzel understands gentlemanly dress."
3,Classic Look.,"This is not a fashion trend book. Very elegant, conservative dressing. I found this book was very useful for knowing how to dress in a daily suit and very high end type of outfits. The book was not useful for US dressing standards in a work place that does not apply the European standards. The pro of the book was that I am better educated in buying a suit and picking out a shirt. Thank you Mr Flusser.Have fun dressing!"
5,"The Authority on ""Conservative"" Men's Fashions","This is the third book on men's fashion that I have read by this author. Mr. Flusser is the authority on dressing in the English style. He also offers insights into choosing colors that will compliment a person's complexion.If I were to choose one author on men's fashion, it would be Mr. FlusserThe author however needs to discuss the influence of the Italian designers. He correctly admonishes department stores for their unprofessional staff. He pins his hopes on the bespoke suit. Unfortunately last year I visited Mr. Flusser mecca, Saville Row, and was sorely disappointed by the unprofessional treatment I received in three stores.I only hope someone in the men's fashion industry, listens.Most men no longer must wear a suit."
3,Better than average horror cheap flick with GREAT nightmares,"I sometimes have really vivid nightmares that are similar to the somber world the protagonist finds herself in when she sleeps. Those sequences come closer to the look and feel of the sort of nightmare where everything seems sort of off key and grotesque than anything I've seen except maybe parts of Jacob's Ladder. If your significant other tends towards dreams of peaceful meadows with happy bunnies (OK, I admit I'm being sarcastic), but never has nightmares, and just doesn't understand why you sometimes wake up shaking and on the edge of tears from a harmless little dream, show him this.I noticed the director is British. I wonder if a little of that is flavored by C.S. Lewis's Great Divorce, such as the bus trip with one end in Hell."
4,Strong Women in Peril - Again,"Thanks to Thora this is much better than average. A weird dual world theme is explored in this clever but not great scare film. The script and direction are just okay. Nice look too. Not too graphic, more of a suspenseful mind game. A good example of the lead raising the whole production. Also see the obscure ""Left in Darkness"" for another good but not great film with a strong female part."
3,Not quite accessible but has its moments,"In one of the DVD's special features, the director notes this film is influenced by Japanese horror. That's a valuable fact to keep in mind while watching. It has that esoteric feel and pace so common in Japanese horror, though this film's resolution is slightly less accessible. Cast about for some message board discussions once you've read for some interesting theories and interpretations.Beyond the plot, this is a visually interesting film. Color and lighting creating remarkable contrasts between the parallel story lines, each slightly surreal."
2,kind od f blah,This movie was not terrible but one of those movies that left you thinking it could have been much better.Basically its about a girl(blonde haired thora birch) who has nightmares where she has brown hair and is being stalked by a killer called needle tooth.This brown haired thora is also having nightmare where she is blonde haired thora.The ending is kind of predictable as I saw it coming right away.Some gore in this and not many scary moments at all.I fell asleep about 30 mins it and had to rewatch it.
3,Better than I was expecting,"I caught the edited-for-TV version on SciFi and when it started, it seemed like it might be just another bad SciFi Saturday night flick but I ended up watching this to the end. Kind of like a car wreck that you just have to turn & look, this film manages to be weird but still interesting enough to keep you watching and make you wonder what the heck is going on. One thing I liked about this film was the color of it - some of the outdoor scenes had an almost sepia color tone to it that really added to the mood the director wanted to create. If you're a Thora Birch fan (as I became after seeing Ghost World), you'll probably like her in this, too. This is on my will-buy list. 3 and a half stars."
2,Lackluster...,"As a Thora Birch fan, I ignored the negative reviews and purchased this movie based solely on my trust in Ms. Birch's ""judgement."" Boy, oh boy was I wrong. This movie had all the makings of a great script, very good actors, it was just executed poorly. The ""twist"" at the end is easily predicted within 30 minutes into the movie. Thora's acting was great and actually, all the actors did a very good job, the movie itself was just poorly written. I highly suggest renting this movie before making the leap to buy to see if it is your cup of tea. Still a Thora Birch fan, just a poor movie role choice."
3,Aspect Ratio: 1.78:1,I had though DVD production companies stopped making widescreen for 3:4 only aspect ratio TVs since MGM got sued but I was wrong! Apparently Anchor Bay did not get the message! This movie is stated as 1:78:1 widescreen but it does not play that way on a real widescreen TV! The picture is squashed! Someday!
4,Okay movie.,"I bought this movie because it was a horror movie starring Thora Birch. I expected it to be a total piece of crap. I was suprised. It was a decent movie. There are movies such as THE MESSENGERS and PULSE which I bought thinking they were going to be good and for me personally, I thought this movie which I had no expectations of, was better than the two aforementioned movies which I thought would be good when I bought them."
3,Super Strange Movie,Not a very good movie ... The only reason to watch it is for Thora Birch ... enough said.
1,A contender for worst film of all time,"I really don't know what the other reviewers were smoking when they watched this movie. This has gotta be a contender for one of the absolute most abysmal films of all time. It is exploitative, disgusting, poorly acted, poorly shot, and looks to have been edited with a dull paring knife. When my stomach wasn't churning at the gratuitous splatter and random creepiness, it was turning over from the stilted dialog and wooden delivery of the actors.The box cover copy cites David Lynch as an influence/comparison to this film. David Lynch is an artist, and his works are incomparable to this mess that would get you booted out of film school. This is a low-budget exploitation of gore and misogyny. The creator of this movie is simply a butcher--of women, and of celluloid.If you can actually sit through this nonsense with any kind of appreciation for it, I pity you."
5,Never gets old...,"I bought this book when I was about 11 years old. I am now 20, and still use it. All the base folds are relevant for alot of the more advanced models that I fold. I will never get rid of this book, and it should be in every origami lover's library!"
5,"Excellent ""Insider"" Tips & Recommendations","A helpful guide for ""inside"" eats when traveling. I highly recommend this book!"
2,Where's the Chef?,"If chefs only get to eat out on Sunday and Monday nights and most chefs eat out on Sunday and Monday nights, then who's cooking @ the restaurants when the visitng chefs show up? Just one of the many gaps in this book. I have loved the other three books by this pair, but found this one to be quite thin on material. You can't ask one chef in the state of New Jersey about his favorites, and think that's at all representative of the universe. Even the New York section was repetitive. I think they should have spent a few more months on this one."
4,A mouth-watering gastronomic tome.,"I'm hungry....I find CHEF'S NIGHT OUT, the most recent book from foodie factory Andrew Dornenburg and Karen Page (authors of BECOMING A CHEF, DINING OUT, CULINARY ARTISTRY and the BECOMING A CHEF JOURNAL -- all within the past five years), useful. Or inspirational, anyway. This wildly overdesigned book basically asks a hundred top American chefs where they like to eat out, both in their own cities and other places. You can use it as a guidebook (I will have to eat in La Iguana Feliz and Nicholas the next time I am in Portland, La Folie and Chava's Mexican Restaurant in San Francisco, Etats-Unis in New York -- these are cities I think I know well, and these places are new to me), for your general food education (with its appendixes and lists), or read it just for fun. CHEF'S NIGHT OUT is pure pleasure...."
3,Not nearly as good as Dusk :(,"I loved Dusk and was pretty disappointed with this book. There were some good parts to the book but for the most part there was a lot of wasted pages dealing with the dream of a burning library. WIth such a great start as Dusk this was one of the most anticipated books for me this year. It kind of reminds me of Kill Bill. Part I was simply awesome but the second part--while a good movie in its own right--was a huge letdown. It is possible that if you read this book without reading the first book, you might just think it is fantastic. It is very well written as is everything from Lebbon but just didn't have the power of the first book. Oh well. I am still a fan of Lebbon and will probably read many more of his books in the future,PG"
5,a page turner !,"Tim Lebbon has put together a great pair of books. Dawn along with Dusk is as good as the best, buy these two and enjoy a very very good read.."
5,What the heck....,"What the heck is what I said when I decided to buy this CD; it was from a little used CD store in south Georgia back in 1997, and all I have to say is, where is the rest of their stuff? This group has a very matter of fact way to their music, it's basic, but got some real catchy lyrics, and a bit of a CCR sound to the lead singer. I love ""same day twice"", I can be humming it over and over all day without getting tired of it. Anyhow, if these guys made any more, of the same sound with that skinny group mentioned earlier, you can plan on seeing me hunting them down. Good stuff, just wish there was more out there...keep it going guys!"
5,Hey John,This is one of my favorite albums of all time! I heard that you guys had changed your name to Skinny Livin but I have not been able to find your music anywhere. Is it available?
5,recollections,"Leslie was born in London in 1910 and moved when he was 16 to South Africa where he was a Uniform Clothing Manufacturer. He was married for over fifty years and has five children Paul, Janet and Susan, Derek and Edwin (two sets of twins.) He emigrated to La Jolla in 1982 where he currently lives. He has twelve grandchildren and right now has 12 great-grandchildren and counting, spread around New York, Connecticut, Canada and California, who he feels wil be a large portion of his readership. - from book's back cover"
5,A Pan-Cultural Gem!,"This disk is a true melding of ""Eastern"" and Western cultures and styles. Robert Dick is one of the best flutists anywhere, and his pairing with virtuoso Steve Gorn is relevatory. Both contribute their unique talents and create a hybrid that is greater than the sum of its parts, as wonderful as those parts are. A must have for any musician who is serious about exploring new avenues and adventurous collaborations."
4,Fabulous!,"I absolutely recommend this c.d. to anyone who wants to broaden their horizons in music. Music is headed in an absolutely amazing direction and it's a great feeling to know where that might be. My personal favorites are ""Calaveras Jump"" and ""Piece in Gamelan style."""
5,Great for the money,"My fiance enjoys astronomy, so I bought him this telescope for Christmas last year. He absolutely loves it and watches the weather religiously, hoping for a cloud-less night. A great product!"
1,JUNK,"I bought this for my parents as a christmas gift. We took it out of the box and had it running for about 10 minutes before it broke. It wasn't like we were throwing a ton of coins in at one time. The machine says 20 coins max, we were putting in 12 at most. Coin machines are a good idea and very useful if they work. I did some research before buying this particular one. It seems that all of them are a waste of money unless your looking to spend over $100 but I took my chances on a cheaper one and was let down. I would rate this disappointment a 0 if I could. Don't fall in to the same trap I did!"
1,Beautiful .......but BROKE the third month into using it :(,Looks very pretty sittin on top of the desk. Wood color is a rich med brown. Sorted coins great untill the third month it stopped working. Not sure if we just use it alot (on a daily basis) or its just poorly made .
2,"works, but not for long","the other reviewers that like this item have only used it for a short while. It worked nicely for about 6 months, although during that time I had to sand the drawer holding the tubes becasue the humidity made it stick. It is a toy and don't expect it to last long....the batteries last less and less as the motor dies until it won't go no more."
2,did not like the return policy,The coin bank that I ordered was not what I wanted and returned it. The price of the bank was $51.00 and in order to return it cost me $10.00. So I ended up with no bank and having to pay shipping charges of $10.00 for something that was not what I thought it was when I seen it on amazon.I will shop first in the stores before ordering anything on line again.To costly.
5,Lots of sharks on this one DVD,"Two great Discovery Channel shark features on one DVD. I especially liked the ""Ultimate Guide"" since it showed several sharks I had never heard of and/or seen on video. The Greenland Shark was quite a sight, I replayed that portion three times. If you like shark videos I believe you'll like both the features."
4,Shark DVD,"This is an educational DVD on sharks; however, the title is misleading in that there is very little info on great white sharks (until the end), but it is very informative. A must for any shark fan."
1,Never received undamaged product,We received the first ice machine badly damaged but hadn't opened the box before UPS left so didn't realize it for a couple of days. To Amazon's credit they gave credit for the first one immediately and shipped a second at my request. When the second one came we checked it as soon as it came in the door and it was even more badly damaged than the first so we sent it back.The damage seems to be due to the poor packaging- so very little protection for such an expensive item! I have been forced to go elsewhere and spend hundreds more for a machine that produces less in the hopes that the manufacturer will know how to package it's machines for shipment.
3,Mine worked!,"Well, I bought mine from another source. The unit was great and made perfect ice. Two problems though. First, it seems to quick freeze the ice and then dumps it in an insulated box. But, the box is not refrigerated, only insulated. So the ice melts pretty quick which leaves you with a lot of wasted water. Second, and the reason we did not keep it, it is crazy loud! Louder than any other kitchen appliance. And it runs on & off all day and night. So, I am still looking."
1,DO NOT TRY LOOSE YOUR MONEY!!!!!!!!!!,Do not Buy this productI Purchased march 2009 but out of order just 4 month later.Company Don't care manufacture warrenty because they don't have part.since 2 month I am waiting for Part!!!!!!!!!!!!!!There Customer Service Dept. say they don't have any Idea??????PLEASE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!DO NOT TRY LOOSE YOUR TIME AND MONEY!!!!!!!!
3,Luke warm on this lens,Pros: gives a wider angle than the stock Optura 500 camcorder lens. Solidly constructed.Cons: Not nearly as big a visual difference as I was hoping for. Lens is very heavy and adds considerable weight to the camcorder. Very expensive for the difference it makes.
5,Fun Learning,"At last a language vendor has recognized the need to incorporate songs and melody to learning. Rush hour Spanish is great to listen to just for the pleasant sounds and enthusatic speakers who will keep you entertained. Can hardly image why the prior person felt that the vocabulary was presented too quickly. There are printed translations to guide you should you need make such reference to any of the ""new"" vocabulary. My only hope is that a more advanced instructional CD would be published using the same technique. Just can't say enough about this approach."
3,Why no Arabic version?,"I have not bought this book. I am looking for the Arabic version, but apparently only the English version exists, which is strange, because this was originally written in Arabic! I tried searching on Amazon and Google, but no luck. What is the problem? Why can they not provide the original, non-translated version?"
2,astonishing difficulty,"Let me start by saying that Rayman Advance's graphics are amazing. They really impressed me. However... The difficulty and blind jumps border on ridiculous. If you don't have the code for unlimited continues, you won't make it past the second world. It seems like I lost 15 lives per stage, and then another 20 or so lives trying to defeat the bosses. While the difficulty improves the longevity of the game, the frustration jusn't isn't worth it. Wait till the Gameshark comes out before you pick up this title."
4,Awsome but..,This is an awsome game but it is very challenging i wish i could have rated this a 4 1/2 but you can't.
2,rayman is BORING,"Rayman is the worst game ever. The two stars i gave it are only for the graphics, the gameplay sucks. Music is repetitive and boring, as is the gameplay. Do you like walking around the most boring worlds you could imagine collecting blue balls while avoiding flying mosqitoues, and then beating that level and playing the same one in a different colour? If so, this game is for you. The graphics are good, hats all. DONT BUY THIS EVER!! GET PERFECT DARK FOR N64 INSTEAD."
3,Rayman repeats,"Rayman is interesting for someone who doesn't mind repeating levels. After you beat the 1st,2nd and 3rd level it goes back to the first level. The first level is simple but the second level has monsters, but you don't have any attacks. It's just Okay!"
5,Rayman is the name for a GBA game!!,"The game called ""RAYMAN"" is the best game in the world. It is so fun."
1,Rayman Advance: Not much cop,"I think that Rayman is a game, just not suited for anyone who knows anything about video games or has played something like Black and White or Mario Advance.It is sooooo E...A...S...Y, my 4 year old cousin completed it in 4 hours!I am glad that I didn't buy it and have played it a few times at my cousin's and completed it every time.Don't buy it is my final verdict."
4,Ray the Man is BACK! in Game Boy Advance,"If you like puzzels then you'll love this game it is a very chalenging game, and I Love It I have Never played this game in game boy advance but I have played it for playstation And it is the best game i have ever played. I really really encourage you to pre order this game Thank you for partisipatingP.S. Don't forget the code if you pre order it"
1,Whats so fun,I think its stupid gameTheres no fun at all its also gorrey and boring and it gets boring and blah blah after like 10 min
5,Rayman never dissapoints!,"Rayman is an adorable little guy with no arms or legs. But that does not stop him from his quest to save the Electoons. Rayman Advance is the first game to really show off the advanced graphics capabilitys of the GBA, and it has very smooth controlls, which make for good gameplay. The game is fun, and replay value is good, because you have to go back to levels that you have already completed once you have new powers so you can find all of the cages. The game allows you to save often, which is good, and it is not the annoying passwords of the GBC game. This and Tony Hawk should be the first games you buy for the GBA.Oh,and for those of us who like to have walkthroughs, there is one in the first issue of Nintendo Power Advance."
5,Hours of challenge and great entertainment,This is probably one of the more entertaining games at the time of GBA's debut. Plenty of button mashing just to navigate around and the color and resolution is outstanding. Entertaining animation and extremely smooth scrolling helps to minimize the frustration of missing that ledge by a handswidth. Extremely challenging in the later stages but with the help of Rayman's friends those challenges can be met by some unique power ups. Some of the icons indicating Raymans life and energy may seem a tad big and can easily get in the way of areas you are trying to negotiate through. Game play is fun and who can resist the awfully cute Rayman?
4,Rayman rules!,"If you've tried playing the the demo Gameboy Advances a lot of stores have out then you've probably been underwhelmed by the Mario Advance game they're all loaded with. If you want to see what the GBA can really do then this is the game to get. The graphics are spectacular! If it weren't for the small size of the screen, you'd think you were playing a console. My one gripe is the sound. The sound FX for the game are fine but the music isn't much better than what you'd hear on an ordinary Gameboy."
4,Three for one,"I never actually expected Half-Life Source Death Match and DoD source to be bundled in this package when I first bought this. It was a pleasant surprise, needless to say. But Counter Strike itself is a great game. Must-own for FPS lovers."
1,why??,i still cant play because it will not download the game !!!!!!! why????? there is this message
1,Displeased,"I bought this game thinking it would be fun. This game is really no fun at all. Played 2 weeks only, to get to single played is a bunch of bull. Sometimes you don't want to play on line. This game not worth the effort it takes to get to single player. If you like on line games 99% of the time buy it. If not skip it."
4,kate,very fun game however you die a lot due to it being a online game played with many players who probably pay 24/7
4,"Amazing Graphics, familiar Game","This product was originally exactly what I was looking for with a retail package for HL2. I had played though Half Life 2 at a friends house and didn't want to put out the money to buy the game just to play CS:S. The problem here though, is that the games are essentially clones of the original Half Life mods, just with better graphics. Counter Strike feels a little changed, map layouts are a bit different than 1.6, and weapons are a bit more random in hitting what you aim at. (inaccurate). Day of Defeat source is pretty much an identical clone of Day of Defeat, just much much prettier, and at release there's only 4 maps compared to the hundreds that I've played in 1.6. The game runs much better under the Source engine than the original mod did on the Half Life 1 engine. If you have no interest in Half Life 2's single player and you don't already have 1.6, this is a product that you won't regret buying. (at least I didn't, and I have 1.6)"
4,An Addicting First-person Shooting Game....,"Counter-strike Source is a fantastic gaming experience. The game is gorgeous (if your computer is able to handle the graphics) and the sound is intense.At first, you may be disoriented (I began running around shooting like a madman as if I was playing a Quake game). But soon, you will realize how to play. You can't just run into a room with guns a-blazing.The game interface is simple (point and shoot) but the game play may be difficult or even frustrating; practice makes perfect though!I play this game with my house-mates and we love every minute. Buy it and host a LAN party; just don't kill each other if you lose. Some people who play this game online play too often (get a life you losers)!"
1,What a dissappointment!,"The game itself is fantastic. Very enjoyable when you find a server without hackers. I ordered the game used expecting an awesome deal. It arrived on time, but without the product code! Why would anyone sell a PC game without a product key? I can't even use the game without Steam! All I wanted to do is play some Counter Strike, but I can't, thanks to the irresponsible ways of the seller. Thanks a lot! Now they have my money and I have something useless. Just fantastic. Don't be fooled by the cheap prices that people are selling this game used for. Copies without product keys are useless. Spend $20 on a new copy."
2,Eh. Doesn't hold up at the end of 2007,"This game isn't bad, and it does have a huge number of players, but it isn't all that good either. The game is completely multiplayer-only, and the graphics and weapons are more complex on the completely free multiplayer portion of F.E.A.R. Other problems include unimaginative level design by third parties, annoying voice-overs, and a strange astandard default keyboard layout. Personally, I feel like I've wasted the ~$20 I blew on this game, given that I already had a copy of that free game. Probably should have held on to my money and used it to pick up the Orange Box. This game doesn't hold up on its own to warrant blowing any real money on it. It's worth fiddling with if you can get it for free or bundled with a good game, but it certainly wasn't worth $20."
1,Not Really Worth It,"Simply put, you can buy half life 2,which is cheaper, and get 3 of these games. But if you dont want half life 2, someone should beat you, this would be a perfect package. Also, for ten more dollars, you can get this and HL2 all from steam and never leave the house, no shipping. You dont really want deathmatch anyway. It sucks.Still great games, but if you like them, they all started out as mods for half life. Just buy HL2."
5,Simply the best game i ever played,"When i first got this game i played non stop literally. i've had thhis for about half a year and i am still not the best at it. it takes a long time to get good at this game. anyway, i've played non stop every chance i get for half a year. its literally the most addicting game i ever played, its not like one of those games that u just play for a month and give up on it , i mean its ADDICTING. ok now we go into the game. there r 2 teams or sides, the terrorists and the counter-terrorists. there r 2 ""missions"": the terrorists plant a bomb and te CT's (counter terrorists) have to kill the T's or defuse the bomb or there r hostages and CT's have to rescue them. the only real difference betweeen terrorists and counter-terrorists in this game r the guns. i think personally the CT's have better guns but thats my opinion.Bottomline: This game is so much fun its addicting like no other game before. SO GET IT NOW!!!"
3,One of the most hacked games ever.,"I love a good shooter, and as far as FPS games go, CSS is one of the better ones. But, this assumes your game is completely free of players who have down loaded hacks to automatically aim their weapons for them, or otherwise give them an unfair advantage.On the plus side there's a variety of user made addons in terms of maps and skins meant to enhance the legitimate gaming experience. In this regard it's a fun game to get lost in with the right crowd.Beyond that I tend to shy away from it, and only play it when NOVALOGIC's superior Delta Force and Joint Operations' servers are down.Take it for what it is. Enjoy what you can."
4,Customizable fun.,CS:S is an action-packed first person shooter that is customizable/programmable by the admins (with plugins). It really keeps the game unique and fun.
5,classic,"most fun pc game ive ever played, love the realism 2-3 hits taken and your down for the count. This is the game that all games are testesd by. NEver gets old always fun too play, just watch playing past 430 because the adults get off work and are almost too good buy this it is money well spent"
4,"OK, but only to a point","I'll pick up a copy of CQ every once in a while when there's an article of interest, but find it generally too limited. QST is a better general coverage amateur radio magazine - the problem being that unless you belong to the ARRL (and get it with your membership), it can be hard to find. On the other hand, you can JOIN the ARRL for about the same cost as subscribing to CQ anyway ... and get a better magazine. My advice is to pass CQ by and pick up the ARRL membership with QST magazine (www.arrl.org) instead. CQ will be available on the supermarket or bookstore rack if there's a current issue you want."
1,Still waiting for first issue,"I subscribed to CQ Magazine for two years on 10/22/12. I have enjoyed reading CQ Magazine in the past but my first preference has been and is QST to which I also subscribe.As of 12/31/12 when our last mail was received am still waiting for the first issue of my new CQ Magazine subscription.C. Bowers, Kaysville, Ut"
1,Have not received any copies yet.,"Not so good. Still waiting for the first copy.What if you want to put NO ""stars"". It won't submit."
2,Disappointed,"I bought the 2.1 oz bulk size Pro White Gel and it has been a real disappointment. The gel is a dried out consistency and does not spread evenly in the tray. It also has not been very effective. I bought a similar product from this company a few years ago and was pleased, but they have changed the formulation."
1,Expensive for negligible results,"The kit has some nice touches, like three of everything in case you mess up. The trays to get started immediately are also nice. However, the results were not anything near what I had expected (or noticeable, for that matter). I used all of the gel and followed the instructions carefully, but my teeth have not gotten any whiter. Save your $80 for a product that works."
4,Bunny Hugs for Hartman,"One grumpy bunny (the title character) is forced to endure the mindless cheer of his three den-mates, until a wolf captures them all and pops them into his stew pot. Quick-thinking Grumblebunny uses his natural bad temper to save the day.This has been a big family favorite since we borrowed it from the library. My son, especially, likes to read with the growly voice of Grumblebunny. Both kids (ages 6 and 8) love that the grouchy bunny won in the end.I, personally, don't like the art as much as they do. The character likenesses are a little too distorted for my taste."
2,Grumble....,"Well, kind of dark for a childrens book. But there might be some good lessons on positive outlooks, but I read it once to my 4 yr old son and now he DOES NOT ever want to read it again. He said it is too scary and mean.."
3,MISTA MISTA MISTA,"WELL THIS ALBUM AIN'T HALF BAD. I THINK IT WAS IN 96 WHEN I FIRST HEARD THEM AND THEY CAME OUT WITH BLACK BERRY MOLASSES. A FRIEND OF MINE HAD THE ALBUM AND SO I LISTENED TO IT AND FOR SOME REASON ""I THINK THAT I SHOULD BE"" JUST CAUGHT MY ATTENTION AND I MEAN IT HAD A STRONG AFFECT ON ME. I MEAN I BOUGHT THE CD AND HAD THAT SONG ON REPEAT. IT IS A NICE SONG. OTHER TRACKS THAT I LIKED WERE LADY AND THE WELL KNOWN B.B.M. I'M JUST WONDERING WHAT HAPPENED TO THIS GROUP OF GUYS?"
5,Love it,Dear Mista i love your all of your song and i will do any thing to meet you all Love Jmarie from buffalo
4,Young but talented,"For the times, this album should have done more than it did. I blame their marketing. I was 14 and LOVED Mista, but then they just disappered. I'm so happy for Bobby that he's getting another ""chance"". When I heard his ""Slow Down"" song, I had to look him up on the net. I saw his picture and I was like ""OMG that's the Mista boy!"" LOL. I LOVED Blackberry Molasses and Lady. I still have the video tape of their video when it used to air on BET. Man.. memories..10 years have floated by."
4,They'll be back!!!,"This album was a great wake up and start cleaning album.I was sadden to see them not come out with more music.Well the time has come for them to be heard once again.They will be featured on Nelly's upcoming album ""Suit"" the track name ""In My Life"".The guys sound even better as the sang the smooth hook and chorus...I'm glad to see the guys back."
5,Mexico uncovered,"There is a consistant light which runs through Cartier-Bresson's work. It is the late afternoon light or the early morning glow, that enters his leica. We see it in the streets, behind the waitress in the Mexican bar as she leans unknowingly towards Cartier-Bresson's lens. It's surrounded by this light that Cartier-Bresson feels most at home, even in Mexico. Mexican notebooks is full of all Cartier-Bresson's hallmarks; real people in real situations. Circumstance and the click of his shutter fixes them in their descisive moment. This is a collection no photojournalist should be without."
4,Lovely songs for parents and children,"This is a charming collection of mostly 60's songs, set to a slower pace and sung with a charming falsetto by Linda Ronstadt. There are new versions of songs by the Beach Boys and the Ronettes, plus a great version of the classic 'Angel Baby'. The only glaring oddity is a slow version of Queen's 'We Will Rock You' which doesn't seem to belong. The rest is absolutely lovely, and you will never tire of playing this cd over and over for your child."
5,Perfect Lullaby Time,This CD is my favorite baby gift. My toddlers have fallen to sleep listening to this CD since they were born. The best part is Mommy and Daddy can enjoy it too! It's a wonderful collection of songs (which is good since I've had to listen to it probably a hundred times). Linda never wears out her appeal.
5,Works like a charm...,"We have used this CD nearly every night for the past 14 months in our son's bedtime routine. He knows these songs mean ""sleepy time"", and they never fail to calm him.Even though I've heard this whole CD over 400 times now, I'm still not sick of it. I think that means a lot!"
5,"Sweet, relaxing lullabyes","This is my first choice of music when I want to sit down and relax for awhile. I like it so much, I am buying one for my cousin who just had a baby."
5,"Great for during your pregnancy, too!","Great for pregnancy and baby - I played this lullaby music all of the time while I was pregnant with my daughter Casey and now she loves it! I like to listen to it, too! Linda has a beautiful voice and I love the way she turns even regular songs like ""We Will Rock You"" into lullabies. The soothing words of ""Dedicated to the One I Love..."" help reinforce feelings of bonding towards your baby, even before he or she is born. The beat of the music seems to be at the same speed of a person's breathing as he or she is drifting off to sleep, and there is often a heartbeat-like percussive sound throughout. I highly recommend this CD for every baby and mother!"
4,This is a great album.,"This is one of my favorite Linda Rondstadt albums. There are several great covers of some steady classics. I can listen anytime, but it is especially good when I want to chill out and meditate. Every song feels like someone wrapping their arms around me and making me feel good. I would have given five stars except for the inclusion of ""We Will Rock You"" which, to my ear, is startlingly noisy and harsh compared to the rest of the tracks. I've left it out on my playlist. Overall, highly recommended."
4,I enjoyed it but. . .,"""We Will Rock You"" gets skipped when we listen to this cd. I'm not sure what Linda was thinking with that one! ""Angel Baby"" brings tears to my eyes. We appreciate the friend who gave it to us for a baby shower gift. Certainly worth the investment!"
5,lifesaver,"I bought this cassette when my son was a baby, and it calmed him down every time when he was fussy or wouldn't sleep, much better than nature sounds, etc. (plus those put me to sleep, too). It usually only took a couple of songs. After a few weeks, even if I didn't have the tape with me, I would sing him the songs, and it would work as well. We used it when we traveled by car, when we stayed overnight away from home, and now that he is four, he sings them softly with me, and it still works like a charm. I give this CD or cassette to all my friends who are having a baby!"
5,"Excellent, soothing lullabies.","Linda Ronstadt has transformed several pop songs into lullabies. The arrangements are consistently good and quite similar. I wouldn't call this an innovative CD, but I would consider it a great collection of lullabies. The duets with Valerie Carter and Aaron Neville (cf. Cry Like a Rainstorm, an earlier Ronstadt release) are amazing."
2,Who wants to hear Linda Ronstadt whisper for 1 hour?,"As much as I appreciate Ronstadt's attempt to try something different, I can't think of many people that buy a Linda Ronstadt album to hear her whisper and coo. If you are any kind of a Linda fan, you want to hear some strong belting, some blast it out of the water renditions of pop, rock, country and folk songs with a West Coast feel.This album is strictly for the parents of newborns who are having trouble getting them to sleep. While Ronstadt's singing here is indeed angelic and soothing, it also could easily induce a coma in the average adult. If you like your Linda bold and brassy, skip it."
2,"Voice lost in the mix, and not like Linda","One problem with this CD is that Linda tries to sing it in a breathy, little-girl voice. That makes her sound like any other singer, not distinctive Linda Ronstadt. The other problem is that her voice is buried beneath the 'background singers' (sometimes Linda herself, multitracking), and the whole sound covered with reverb. So you get this sweet echoey sound that has no character. The Amazon.com sound samples are accurate as to what you will hear, and there is no low bass at all.The songs are mainly covers of early 60's pop before the Beatles. If you have software to raise the center vocal by about 8 dB, the album sounds somewhat better. But it will still put you to sleep.I rate this a two star miss by Linda."
1,Horrible,"My mother in law give us this disc when we had our first child. It's sappy crap that should have never seen the light of day. Every original is scores better than this synthesized crap. Especially laughable is the a capella lullaby version of Queen's ""We Will Rock You."""
1,heinous idiotic music,this is quite possibly the worst album I have ever heard.We Will Rock You as a lullaby is completely ridiculous.forget this steaming pile of garbage.
5,I'm saving a copy for my children's children!,"This CD was at times the ONLY calming influence on my children when they were babies. I started playing it when I would rock and nurse my babies to sleep. When they got older and crankier like one car trip I remember, my then nine month old would not stop crying even with stops to feed, change and walk and pat on the back. I then remembered this CD and we were back on the road and happy once again! I have a shrink wrapped copy sitting on my desk even though my 7 and 4 year old have the old copy to play when they want. I'll keep the good copy for the future...I do believe the trick though is to start them early.. the womb isnt too early."
3,"I feel like the odd man out, but...","... neither my wife nor I cared much for this CD. We've both enjoyed Linda Ronstadt's music for many years, through the albums of standards with Nelson Riddle and her Spanish songs. With this CD, though, if you hadn't told us it was Linda, we probably couldn't have guessed. We missed hearing her clear voice, which sounded muffled under a lot of fuzzy reverb (or something). And although including ""We Will Rock You"" makes for a clever pun, this must be the only lullaby CD ever which includes the lyrics ""You've got blood on your face."""
1,Wacky D,This is a piece of @#$% that leaks. Just prime the line manually or get a different brand / model!!!!!!!!!
3,Not what I expected but fine,I have a latex allergy that is horrible. these black ones were not the loose ones I was expecting but as I said ok.
2,socks don't stay up,"Initially they were very comfortable, but after washing they stopped holding up. I wear them with slippers around the house, but they've been sliding down past my heels. I bought two packages and I'm now throwing them out pair by pair after they fall down while wearing. I'm looking elsewhere for replacements."
3,not great,"I was concerned these would be too fragile, but turns out they're fairly sturdy. They don't hold the ear buds all that well however."
2,not strong enough...,"bought this product hopping that it would hold the excess length of my wired headset. I was pretty disappointed to find that it didn't have that much of a strong grip..!!? plus its not big enough to hold the whole thing. and they don't come in one color! like suppose you got your heart set on black, you have to buy the whole set of colors in one pack to get it... =("
3,Not a bad reader,"Quarrington's Home Game is a very zany book filled with lots of comedy. The book has one of the hardest riddles in it, lets see if you can figure it out. What walks on four legs in the morning two in the afternoon, and three at night?"
1,So so writing,"The author writes a preface that gives away too much of the outcome of the team. He rambles on about things that are not only not related to the baseball game, but they are just plain boring. The only good parts about the novel is when the author describes the characters. He gives good examples and paints a clear picture in the mind of the reader."
1,"Bad quality, don't buy","I purchased these to be used on a Sony Vaio. At first they seemed great but within a few weeks they started peeling off. Now, the stickers are sticky or rubbed off. Seems like a good idea but make sure you purchase stickers made of better quality."
4,These get the job done!,"These were easy to use, and work well. I did use alcohol on the keys before putting these stickers on."
5,great product,"got really tired of having to replace keyboards because letters wore off. these are perfect replacements, very easy to read. love them!!"
3,Not a long term fix,These don't last long but are better than buying a new keyboard every few months. I'd rather replace the stickers than throw out a perfectly functional keyboard.
3,Meant for chiclet keyboards or standad keyboards,"Does not work well with my Nexus 7 bluetooth keyboard, neither with the Asus EeePC 701 sized keyboards (87% or something).Works ok for 91% or fullsized keyboards.Letter F and J have a small slit underneath, like on most keyboards; on many bluetooth keyboards for mobile devices, they use a center point, not a slit.Most importantly, and why this product is losing one and a half star, is that there's a lot of keys missing:no enter, no directional keys, no TAB, no SHIFT, no Function stickers (F1, F2, F3, ...), No scroll lock, insert, end, home, pg dn, pg up, print scr, pause/break, no ALT, no CTRL, no windows key, no search, no Fn, no caps lock, no backspace, and no DEL,So all in all, it's missing out a lot of keys.The most important letters and numbers are covered. Then also the symbols like:[{]}\|;:'"",<.>/?-_=+; which actually do not wear as fast as shift, caps, or tab."
1,Unhappy,"Not happy with my order at all. I tried ordering a keyboard which I can read and thought I did. Need to look at their ordering structure, it causes confusion if someone does not ""study"" the order thoroughly."
1,Cheap quality don't buy,"I bought this product for my Dell Laptop. They look great the first time you use them, but these so called ""quality"" stickers won't last long. After 4-5 weeks the letters and stickers will wear out. If you have to buy keyboard stickers make sure they are made from durable Lexan."
3,Item Review,"i just received the item just today 12/12/2010. when i bought the item i thought it was nice and that it would cover all my keyboard keys. when i recieved it it was great, but it was missing some of the other key covers that i really wanted such as enter, F keys such F1 to F12, Caplock, shift the numbers keypad on the side etc. etc. you get the point. Sad to Say I was dissapointed that it did not come with those. It only came with letters A to Z, and these < > ? : "" { } | item on top of the Letters -(~ 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 - =).So if you are looking to buy something that COVERS ALL KEYBOARD keys, then DO NOT BUY THIS FOR IT DOES NOT COVER ALL THE KEYBOARD KEYS.I am telling this because i wish some told me that because then i wouldn't have baught it."
5,A great book.,"I've been hunting pheasants and writing about hunting pheasants for several years. I also have read everything I can get my hands on about the subject. I feel comfortable saying that ""Ringneck"" is THE single finest collection of pheasant hunting photography and writing ever assembled under one book cover. If I could, I would give it ten stars. When bird hunting season is several months away and I am itching to get out with my dogs, without fail I will go to the bookcase and pull out ""Ringneck"" for a brief venture to that magical season. Simply a great book."
3,Get a Frommer's Japan not just Tokyo,"Just went to Tokyo and took this book with me. The few places they reccommend that I went to were just ok. I suggest getting a book for all of Japan as this book only covers Tokyo and there were several places or Kui in ""Tokyo"" that I went to that weren't even covered in the book, that were very interesting!Japan is a great place to Visit!!"
2,"For Tokyo, go with Lonely Planet's","I'm usually a big fan of Frommer's guidebook style, except this once, I actually wished I got the Lonely Planet's. In this edition places of interest were arranged under categories of museums, shopping, sports etc, which is normal but I wish they'd have it arrange under different areas/ neighborhoods too. For example, if I'm in a certain area, I'd want to visit all of everything that's within that area to avoid traveling back and forth. Another thing is, when it gave the subway stops to places of interest, it fails to mention which subway LINE which can be confusing because Tokyo has so many different subway companies."
1,Horrible Directions and Maps - Lost in Tokyo,"My companion and I tried to use this book in Tokyo (since we purchased it and felt that we had to get full value). Needless to say the maps were horrible (placements of the restaurants, hotels and sites on the maps were incorrect). They also have the horrible habit of putting only the english names (hello!!!, we're in Japan) of the restaurants/sites/hotels in the book so when you try to find the place - you may walk past it endlessly until you ask every stranger on the street. Unless you're going to stick to the most basic tourist areas where everything is translated for the gaijin, don't even think about this book. On the other hand, if you like to meet strangers, this is an excellent excuse. [Eventually we broke down and had to buy another travel guide]"
3,"dated, but useful...","I was required to have this and volume I for a class (info-sci). It is somewhat dated, but has relevent points that still apply to today's issues. Many of the facts and figures listed have changed, but even the author suggests tweaking the numbers to reflect current standards. Not a bad read..."
3,Class room books,This is a wonderful product. It showed up in great shape. What frustrated me was it took alot longer to get the two books. I'm not sure what the hold up was. I paid the extra money for quicker shipping. I did get a refund on the additional shipping. Maybe this was a fluke. I would like to think so. I have allot of books to buy over the next 4 years. I will be more careful next time.
5,A wonderful memory,"I first saw this many years ago when I was a child. It disappeared and I've been hunting it ever since. Now that I have it, I can relive the happy memories this brings as often as I wish to!"
3,Not for 4 year olds,"I got this for my 4 year old daughter. I would suggest waiting a year or two longer. Some of the stories are long and overly complex and minimally illustrated. The short ones are often hard to interpret to a young child (the story of the two monks carrying the young woman across the water for example, my child is a little young to get much out of a story who's moral is something along the lines of 'obey the spirit of the rule, not the rule')."
3,Diverse stories of Zen parables with varying lengths.,"The book includes 13 Zen parables and folktales from Japan, India, China, Tibet and Burma. It is interesting but the length and complexity vary a lot from story to story. Smaller children (4-6 years old) may be ready for the shorter ones while this book needs more illustration to attract their attention. A good book overall."
5,great book to read to your children about buddhism,this book is great and easy for me to explain to my child why we practice buddhism and she gets idea on how buddhism is and respect it
5,"Very,Very,Very Fun",I rented this game and now I am asking for it.This game is so much fun!!!!!!!!!!!1Buy this game.You won't be dissapointed!!!!!!At least rent it!!!!!
3,Really fun but way to easy,I loved this game when i had it for the gameboy color and i have no idea what happened to it or my gameboy. So i thought this would be a good game and it was. It was even better then the gameboy version. But i found it very easy and beat it in 3 days.
2,Disappointed in Showboat,"I expected much better from this recording. I knew the CD was only highlights from ""Showboat,"" but they left out far too much material.Most diappointing was ""Ole Man River"" sung by a tenor. It left such a bad feeling, I found it hard to enjoy the rest of the CD. Normally recordings from London are excellent. Not this time."
4,Life saving,"I had a 4 pound starving, adult feral cat arrive in my house a year ago. Her fur was falling out, her bones showed and she was diagnosed with FLUTD. After feeding her this food for the last year she is free of FLUTD, has the softest fur I have ever felt on an animal, save a chinchilla, and has maintained her weight at a healthy 9 pounds in spite of being an indoor cat.This food is well balanced, made from excellent ingredients and puts to use the latest in nutritional information about cats.Highly recommendedRegarding frugalone ""PJ""'s review: ""No one knows for sure why some cats get FLUTD and others don't. Many potential causes have been hypothesized, including viruses, abnormal urinary retention, obesity, bladder defects, and-the most popular theory to date is improper diet. In reality, one or all of these factors might play a role in the occurrence of FLUTD.""--maxshouse.com(I have no affiliation with maxshouse.com)"
1,Don't Believe It!,"I read the great hype about this cat food. It sounded like the best thing I could give my cat. Unfortunately, I didn't even finish a complete 4 lb bag when my cat got blocked and he had to be rushed to the clinic. So even though they say it is for their urinary tract health with proper pH to prevent struvite crystals, don't believe it. (I would have rated this food zero but the system made me rate it at least one star.)"
1,2006 universal mechanical code,"How can a company advertise a 2006 mechanical code book, show a picture of a 1997 code book, and ship a 1997 edition?!! I didnt look at the picture Because I can read! Also the book took forever to ship!"
3,there are better,"although the recordings are impure, scratchy, etc -- the music is wonderful.but unless you're familiar with the songs and artists or who, you won't know what is playing; the order is jumbled.The biggest disappointment is that although it's clear this is a collection from several different recordings, there are no liner notes listing the personnel for each tune, nor the composer. Jazz fans will recognize Gillespie on several songs, Bud Powell and Coleman Hawkins, but it's unfortunate that the dates and musicians are not identified in detail.There are much better introductions to Parker and the talented people he played with."
2,"yawn, been there...done that","This EP ranks as the usual Erasure 80s hit-disco fare before the bands swift decline after 1989's ""Love To Hate You."" The EP contains remixes and originals of both ""Stop!"" (which was on the radio in 1988) and ""Knocking On Your Door"" (an uptemp disco romp). There are three other songs. If you like Erasure in terms of ""Oh L'Amour"", ""A Little Respect"" or ""Chains of Love"", then you like this little EP. Erasure fans these days are mainly limited to guys who work at the Gap or 20-something girls who shop at the Gap. Vince Clark is a synth master but the songs are now somewhat tiresome. I don't think I've played this CD since about 1991."
2,Damaged goods were shipped twice.,"I ordered this album based on the ability to display quarters from both mints and to show both sides of the quarters. The first album was received with a cracked interior spine and evidence of rough handling at the origin - not in transit. Amazon courteously and quickly shipped a replacement but it also arrived with evidence of rough handling, including a sliced edge. I returned the second album for a refund and bought a replacement product at a local coin store where I could inspect the item before purchasing. I appreciate Amazon's service but am disappointed that damaged goods were shipped both times."
1,50 State Coin Album,"The album is very difficult to use. It is difficult to get the quarters into their slots, due to the location of the covering on the page, i.e. the center slots are near to impossible to use."
2,It's missing the 2009 page for territories.,Why didn't they include the territories 2009 page? That year's quarters don't fit into national parks. Where the hell am I going to put my 2009 quarters now???They should at least make a page insert to correct this serious omission.If you are a coin collector- stay away from this garbage.
2,"Good design , but really Bad Quality","I Used to buy product from Amazon, but this time surprised me.Firstly, the package isn't strong enough. one side got 2 inched broken. Even nothing lost, but looks like somebody try to broke the box before arriving.for this product - The Official U.S. Mint 50 State Quaters :1) the printing of the cover page is a mass.2) each page was damaged in certain level. ( 1 to 3 parts on a page).The quality is not as a new product."
5,American Stae Quarter folder.,Really great item. Excellent inexpensive coin holder which works VERY well and is easy to use. Great product.
5,ST. QUARTER ALBUM,I LIKED EVERYTHING ABOUT IT. THE HOLES WERE SNUG ENOUGH TO HOLD THE QUARTERS FIRMLY. YOU DO HAVE TO BE CAREFUL BECAUSE THE PAGES WILL TEAR.
5,The best way to store your state quarters!,This is a great album and the best way to display your state quarter collection. You can see both sides of the coins and the heavy pages should last a lifetime. Solid construction. A+ product!
1,Very upset,"This was the most difficult thing to put coins in that I have ever experienced!!! Most of the few coins I could even get in the openings, ripped the page....so the book is useless!!"
3,State Quarter Album,"The presentation of these books is nice, but it is very difficult to put the quarters into their slots. Many pages have rips in them because of this. We have 12 of these albums; one each for our grandchildren, neices and nephews."
4,NICE FIT FOR THE QUARTERS..,"THIS IS THE BEST FITTING QUARTER COLLECTOR BOOK I HAVE TRIED, (and I`VE TRIED SEVERAL ) TRUE IT IS SNUG, BUT THE USE OF A SMALL RUBBER HAMMER MAKES FITTING THE QUARTERS EASY...AND THEY DON`T FALL OUT!!!! I LIKE THE WAY IT HOLDS BOTH THE D & P STATE QUARTERS IN ONE BOOK. THE FRONT DESIGN, EDUCATIONAL INFORMATION ON THE PRESIDENTS , STATES OF THE UNION, COMMEMORATIVE COIN PROGRAM,& QUARTER RELEASE DATES MAKES THIS A GREAT BOOK FOR YOUNG & OLD WHO ARE COLLECTING THE QUARTERS.MY ONLY CONCERN & RECOMMENDATION TO THE PRODUCERS OF THIS BOOK IS THAT THE PAPER COVERING COULD STAND TO BE A BIT THICKER.CHILDREN CAN NOT BE LEFT ALONE TO INSERT THE QUARTERS, D/T THEY WILL PUSH THEM THRU THE COVERING. BUT FOR THE PRICE THIS IS AN EXCELLENT BOOK."
2,Disappointed in cardboard quality,"The quarters are easy to fit. Perhaps those who have difficulty haven't taken out the sliding protective plastic. However, the cardboard cover and pages are much flimsier then expected. The cardboard easily splits in the corners with each use. I do like the ability to view both front and back of each quarter and their protective plastic sleeves."
5,Should last a lifetime,"My husband and I absolutely love this book. It's been put together with heavy durable pages, riveted into the spine. The quarters fit perfectly and snugly, can be viewed on both sides and are protected under plastic sheets which slide into the pages. This is a great way to preserve and display your collection!"
4,Well Done,"My kids, ages 7 and 10, love these. You can easily see the front and back of each quarter. My youngest had to be shown the proper way to remove and insert the plastic coverings. She slightly tore one page, which can easily happen without care."
2,Won't work below 40 feet,"I recently took this camera with me on a trip to Jamaica. It worked alright at the surface and down to around 30-40 feet. However, after that the camera would simply turn off. No more light telling the flash was ready, no pictures would take, etc. When we ascended back up above 35 feet or so, it would start working again. I would not recommend this camera for anyone diving past 30 feet."
4,Great product. Does as expected.,I bought these as a replacement to a old set that was falling apart. I did not realize how bad my old ones were. Great product!
1,Disgusting,"I don't think anyone expects couscous in a box to be spectacular, but this stuff smelled and tasted awful. All of the other flavors we've tried from this brand (chicken, mushroom, Mediterranean curry) were actually pretty decent, so it was a surprise just how awful this one was. Avoid at all cost!"
1,disgusting,"I love the Near East pine nut flavor couscous, but this one is absolutely disgusting. I made it today, took one bite, and wondered if I could possibly eat another. It was too salty and tasted fake. I will not purchase this flavor ever again."
1,Waiting For It,"I have been reading romance novels for about 25 years and this is the worst book I have ever read. I have written only one other half hearted review, but I really felt compelled to save other readers from my $9.99 error. This is not a romance, nor is it erotica, it is just trash. Not trashy, just trash. There is plenty of sex, but not really hot sex. I mean having someone tell you they want to F-you, they can't wait to F-you and then when they get to F-ing, because that's what they do in this book, all of the ramming and cramming just made me writhe in imagined pain. Hated it."
3,"3"" lowering blocks..",Great product but not right for a 1998 nissan frontier because it needs a slight angle to align the axle.
5,Excellent Read,"This author, being outside of the government-approved anthropological system, is able to get a behind-the-scenes look at the real, on-going cultures in parts of South America, which continue to practice human sacrifice. He also has done extensive research in human sacrifice; and this book led me to investigate others like it.This author details his own travels and digs at high altitude archaeology. It is a very rivoting book for more reasons than the often too-morbid topic of human sacrifice, because it also shows a side of culture and history in the Andean mountains that is rarely talked about or known.It's an excellent read."
4,Nice software,"This program is very easy for young children but it is a lot of fun. Some of the games are challengin but the school exercises are simple. Despite this, my 4 year old daughter asks to play this repeatedly. It is certainly entertaining."
1,Not Much Help,"This book is clinical, short, emotionless, outdated, and it reads like a college research paper. In dealing with the suicide of a loved one, this book won't be much help."
4,It did help me.,"My son's suicide was 17 years ago. After all of these years I still have my copy although the pages are yellow and full of highlighter. Everyone is different, especially at a time like this but, I do recommend this book."
4,"Babies love, ""What do babies do"" book","I first got this book at the library, but my 18th month old loved it so much, i had to buy it. It is only 12 pages, so it kept his attention span. We would read the page (only 1 to 4 words on each page) and then imitate what we saw. Example: picture of a baby sleeping - we would put our head down as if going to sleep. He, therfore, was seeing, saying, and imitating the things he learned. The thick sturdy pages also made this book last alot longer then some of his others."
3,"Good book, but outdated","This is a good book to inform the reader on the history of Smart, but since its publication in 2004, it's already very outdated. Long gone are the forfour, Roadster, crossblade, and the development of the formore 4x4 vehicles. The book ends without mentioning the new chairman of Daimler, Dr. Dieter Zetsche, or the major changes Daimler made since 2004. Now with the new fortwo (451) model to arrive on the U.S. shores in January 2008, a new book is needed to continue the Smart story by the end of that year.So if you're looking for a historical account on Smart, this is a great book. If you're looking for current materials... wait till the end of 2008 or later."

5,So Realistic,"I am A freshman in High school and I find that in this book they express alot of the things that I go though in everyday life. All the characters in the book are so unique that you can relate to one of them....don't get me wrong the teenagers in this book are not perfect! I think that that is why I enjoyed the book. It's not a fairy tale book. It's actually one of the most realistic books I've ever read. The characters turn into your everyday friends. The football games, the meetings, the friendships, the relationships...They are all part of high school. I'm sure you'll really enjoy this book. You can certainly learn alot from the characters by their mistakes or by their good judgement and the out comes."
5,Great read even if you are not religous!!,"The teens in this book live by Christian values but even if you are not a Christian like myself I think you should read this book.The plot is intense.Think a Christian version of the romance between Dawson andJoey on""Dawson's Creek"".That is exactly what this is!!"
4,cool,"this was a really cool book, I really like this series. The only thing I didn't like about this book was the ben story, I think he's pointless and they should like kill him or something. Not to be mean but his stories are stupid. Other than that i love this book and series and I'm on #8 One real thing. And I never read books before until i got hooked on this series."
5,Great with or without the strings,"Jim Snidero is one of the most interesting jazz musician I've gotten the chance to know in this last decade. His music is melodically articulated and original from the beginning to the end. A good metaphor to describe Snidero's music would be: pure lava flowing out of an intelligent and impetuous volcano. His sense for harmony is endless and his invention goes well beyond all the talent of any of today's emerging alto players. Snidero is great either in traditional jazz combos or with strings. He is just good wine: the more you drink it, the more you like it. If you buy this CD, and if you love both good wine and great music you'll know what I mean."
1,Not quite as good...,"I consider myself a major Gundam fan. In fact, I've seen every Gundam saga except the first one. At first, I concluded that this book and saga are extremely well-drawn with good concepts and an interesting script, but only after twenty minutes, I found it insanely pointless and time wasting. I advise all major Gundam fans, who are greatly fascinated by the world of Gundam, to reconsider before buying this book; but don't let it prevent you from exploring the other Gundam series like 8th MS Team or Gundam Wing."
5,So thrilled to have this music book with the bonus CD!!,"All 8 Songs are wonderful. The best part is the CD that has the same 8 songs played by Dan! I'm so glad that I found this music book from Amazon.com! If you enjoy Dan's arrangement style for the contemporary music, you'd not want to miss this one, 8 original songs composed by Dan!"
2,Dissapointed,"I bought this book, hopeful that it would give me some great suggestions. What I ended up getting was a book that recommended products that the author endorses but do not exist. Case in point, I thought the face-lift-in-a-jar sounded great, so I went to the website that the author owns www.biosynergenics.com, only to find out that the website does not even exist. The book is WAY over priced and there is NO information at all on the web about the author. I even tried to find a site where I could locate the author so that I could order a few of the products she suggested. NOTHING came up. I feel bad to give this book such a bad review, but I honestly think I was tricked into buying this book. I really think this book is a hoax. SAVE YOUR MONEY AND DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK!"
5,Wolves at our Door,"A great film, that warms the heart and shows first hand how a wolf pack functions. Of the 5 or so wolf films I have watched this is the best. Dog owners can understand abit more about their domestic pets."
5,A Great Classroom Tool,"My 4th grade students and I adopted a wolf from the WERC organization and the Wolves of the Nez Perce. I was delighted to find a video that documented their development and let us see our wolf, Lakota, interacting with his pack and his environment. Showing this informative video really helped my students (and me) to develop a deeper affection for Lakota as we watched him fail and succeed in his everyday routine. I would highly recommend this video to adoptive wolf parents and classes. The video is very well done with tons of factual information as well as with presenting a humanistic side to the wolves so that we may develop feelings for them. This video will having you laughing, cheering, crying, and caring about the wolves. The camera work is very up close and personal, too, so that you feel you are right in the forest with the Sawtooth pack. Don't miss this incredible opportunity to learn about these amazing and beautiful animals."
5,cool,"I would recommend this DVD to anyone, but especially to those who are uniformed or uneducated about wolves and their place in the ecosystem. Many myths and prejudices still exist concerning the wolf and this DVD helps answer questions people may have about the wolf. It's also put together wonderfully."
3,Still pertinent,"All-Out-Internet Access sets out to be a planning tool to assist public libraries with the installation of Internet services. At the time this book was published it was current with terms and technology. However, it is now behind not only in terms and technology it mentions, but also with the prices quoted and url's listed. Part three of the book, Step-by-Step to Internet Service, is still timely. The worksheets in chapter nine of this section regarding defining users and their needs, which services to offer, and choosing system specifications are still applicable and useful. Chapter ten briefly touches on establishing Internet use policies for patrons and issues regarding censoring of the Internet. This book does not go in to great detail as to the problems encountered after a library has begun offering Internet services. This book still has pertinent ideas for planning out how to implement Internet services in a library that has yet to do so."
5,A really useful CD.,"This CD is very good. I think all songs are OK. There are some real good too, like ""Popular"", ""Deeper Well"", ""The plan""."
2,Thank God I bought 'Let Go' first !,"Long ago Nada Surf insisted on releasing tiresome post grunge rubbish until they realised that they could write decent songs.This album is a good example of what Nada Surf were like before they metamorphosised into a brilliant power-pop band with the stunning album 'Let Go'.Although the musicianship on High/Low is of a high standard, the songs are all fairly bad especially the dreadful 'Popular' which was Nada Surf's attempt to get noticed by MTV.I am so happy that the first that I heard of Nada Surf was the album 'Let Go' because if I had heard this album first,I would have very quickly decided that Nada Surf were not my cup of tea and I wouldn't have listened to them any further.Do yourself a favour and buy the masterpiece 'Let Go' instead and consign this piece of embarrasing history to the bargain bin where it deserves to be."
4,A great cd,"A gem of a find if You take the chance to listen to it. This cd is very underated, and I dont know what to call it, it has a Emo Indie feel to it. Anyways the best songs on the album are,""Zen brain"", ""Stalemate"",""Treehouse"", ""Sleep"", and the radio friendly ""Popular""."
2,Slightly above generic,"With few exceptions, this album sloshes through with pretty mechanical inclanations..Nada Surf were obviously just starting out, and by no means is it a bad debut rock alternative album, but it is definitly the wrong place to start, hardly hinting at their greatness to come.."
2,Celestron G5 Telescope,Good optics but not very portable (has to remain mounted to tripod). Difficult to setup and use. If you are new you should probably go with a computerized scope.
3,Wireless Modem for the Jornada 540 - 548 Pocket PC's,"This snap on modem (called a Sled) fits tight and worksvery well with my Jornada 548.I have used it for over nine months and use it a least once a day.The only drawback is the download speed (19.2) when gettinglarge images, but text is fairly quick."
4,"Ok, now this is fun...","I've been using the Omnisky modem for about a month now, and it is a nice addition to the Jornada. I have been very happy with the coverage, I've traveled to a few states with it.Keep in mind, the modem speed is not real fast. Downloading email text messages can take some time, as can downloading web pages. But if you want the ability to check on your web site, news, stock quotes, this will be a great help. The modem weighs next to nothing, and it is very easily transportable. (MUCH more so than a laptop.)The only hitch I've found, is that it is best to make sure that you have completely closed Omnisky, Internet Explorer, and your Inbox before turning it off. Otherwise you may have difficulty connecting the next time you turn on your Jornada. However, if you just close all your apps, then turn the unit off. It seems to connect just fine when you turn it on again.This is a great toy for your mobile lifestyle. But with the price tag, get your company to buy it for you..."
1,"Outdated, names are limited","While this book has a great concept, it is not a practical buy for modern parents considering names for their children. Its name selection is VERY limited and even though it was published in 1990, surprisingly lacks reference to many names that were popular in that timeframe, such as Jennifer, Jessica, and Jason. My husband and I are pregnant with our first child and are torn between a few common names, NONE of which were referenced in this book. That said, this book is not helpful to us."
1,Gross contradictions & one celebrity descriptions abound.,"This book is a survey of 30 to 150 respondents for each name on the feelings evoked by the names. This is a prime example of creation by multiple committees. Throughout the book there are numerous dichotomies and trichotomies, such as ""an old spinster who is plain, quiet, lackluster, and secretive ... (or) ... sophisticated and sexy."" Add to that theatrical characters or celebrities by respondents who may cumulatively know only one person, a character or celebrity, with the name, such as: ""Elvira (a) tramp who is weird, spooky, and sexy"" and a typical baby name book and we are left with a short baby name book and a bunch of near useless survey results. If you are after a book to help you choose a name for a child or book character, you can do better than this. And your own very brief survey of friends will likely be more accurate."
3,"Cute idea, somewhat limited and outdated representation","As a writer and a goofball, I use this book both to help me name characters and to tease my friends about people's weird associations with their names. The premise of showing the results of a survey of people's opinions of others names is certainly interesting. However, a majority of the associations are pop culture references and therefore constantly changing--necessitating an update that hasn't come. For my purpose it is a fun and helpfull reference, but if you plan to use it to name your child I think it would be less usefull."
3,"Glossy, but mediocre","Rita Hayworth's performance as Sadie Thompson is okay, but it can't hold a candle to Joan Crawford's brilliant 1932 portrayal. The film is a glossy, technicolor semi-musical, but it seems like its heart was not in the story, restrained by '50s moral codes (and therefore less moving). This film is more about Hollywood glamour and Rita Hayworth's body, which is great if you love classic films, but don't expect a masterpiece (which it very well could have been). It would have been much more entertaining in 3-D."
3,Miss Sadie Thompson,"The movie is a good one. Rita Hayworth at her best and most beautiful. As for the product, I could only view it on my computer. It would not play on my DVD player which cuts the enjoyment in half. I did enjoy watching it on my computer and remember it from when I first saw it at the theaters long ago, but would really have loved to have been able to watch it on my tv thru my DVD player. I wish there was a viewer notation on the list product so a person knows it may not play. I don't really understand the mechanics of this obstacle, so maybe it is something I am doing wrong. I think it has something to do with the ""region"" which I also do not understand. Thankyou anyway, I am happy to be able to watch it on my computer if I want!"
4,Miss Sadie Thompson 1953,"Miss Sadie Thompson (Rita Heyworth 1918-1987) is a bawdy night club entertainer stranded on a tropical island during World War II, and she loves every minute of it...Until she encounters the Reverend Davidson (Jose Ferrer 1909-1992) . When Sadie seeks her salvation throug the hyporcritical minister , she?s met with a brutal assault . But in spite of all he exposes about her past , Sadie managers to find someone who loves her . Don?t miss Rita Heyworth in one of her finest moment of tempestous love and stagging drama . This modern version of MISS SADIE THOMPSON are similare to MISS SADIE THOMPSON from 1928 with Gloria Swanson (1897-1983) . Breattaking scenes from a sunny , tropical island in a great plot . High Quality digital transfer . Highly Reccomended"
2,Miss Sadie Thompson,"It was not made clear in the sales ad that this video was for Region 2 DVD's. In other words, it would only play on European DVD Players. I am fortunate to have friends in the UK and sent the video to them at an additional cost to me, as opposed to returning it to the seller. The Region 2 DVD's should not be listed with the American Region 1 DVD's. That tends to be confusing."
2,knock off,"Read this book awhile back, there is a sequil ""Tainted Blood"". The promised third installment is about 4 years late. The author claims to be an English Major. Due to the numerous typos, grammer, word usage, and other errors, Fordham University English Dept. must be VERY embarrassed.There is definately a Anita Blake knock-off feel, the characters act immature, and the dialogue is often awkward. The author writes a heroine of different looks than herself. But as I read, the descriptions of clothing and make-up would be awful choices for her heroine, but better suited to Ms. Bonnefoux. Years later, I still cringe remembering the red glitter eye shadow ""Holly-Ann"" wears somewhere.Hmmm...are important, mature, vampires attracted to whiny, immature women wearing red glitter eyeshadow?"
5,So much FUN!,"Melanie L. Bonnefoux's 'Blood and Mind' is SO MUCH FUN! A quick read that really packs a punch--it's full of mystery, violence and romance. Holly-Anne Feather is a thoroughly likeable character, and her chemistry with the lead vampire, Lucien, is hot. The mystery, although easily detected, holds some great twists...and the plot doozey at the end will make you wonder, how she came up with it. The book, published by a small house, has editing problems, that is my main criticism. But Bonnefoux's story is nearly flawless--lends itself to a sequel. This is a great, fun read."
3,Puzzled,"I read the other reviews and disagree, the writting was not that much like LKH and nothing at all Buffy-like. This was not a quick read, this book was big and thick and the action was not that fast. I was disappointed in the main character's powers (she needed better super powers). She was spunky, but her mouthing off could get a little annoying. Lucien the vampire was hot, but she kept shooting him down instead of jumping his bones. I'm unsure about whether to get the 2nd book."
3,$70 for a tacky pillow.,"I love the Croscill Townhouse, Dunhill (Dover Manor), Winslow and Love Letter patterns and have tons of them all over my house. This is most expensive and tackiest of the Townhouse collection and I don't recommend it unless you have money to burn and/or are a completest. The way the overlapping material is arranged on the pillow just doesn't work for me. Not sure what a ""fashion"" pillow is and why someone would pay $70 for pillow this size ($90 list)."
5,Wrong title (in more ways than one),"Amazon (and Tower too) have labeled this recording with the wrong title. As you can see from the picture, the name of this recording is ""Student Studies"", not ""Social Studies"". This is a remastering of a previous recording- also called ""Student Studies"". Don't know how this error crept in to both Amazon and Tower websites. Otherwise the music is great; I mean we are talking about Cecil Taylor here- a force of nature on the piano! Also, this guy was obviously no ""student"" at this point (not with Andrew Cyrille on drums)."
5,The next Sublime - They rule,If you're a fan of Sublime and you've been waiting for the next band to take over then these guys are it. The album is really funny and has a cool vibe. They're not trying to be too punk or too reggae. Its totally great. I think the singer is way cool and the songs are catchy.
1,Hacks,"These guys remind me of the losers on the first day of American Idol, You know the ones that are so horrible they just make you you laugh and feel sorry for them at the same time.It's like no one wants to hurt their feelings and tell them how bad they really are.I think they need to give this band thing up and go get a real job, Burger king is always hiring and they're talents hacking a song might come in handy to hack up some ground beef for my next quarter pounder.The singer has very poor vocal range and the writing style and ability is on par with a 3rd graders bathtub songs.All in all you should save your money and pass this one up.Sassqwatch? Dorks !"
3,"Compelling Writing, important subject.","Smartbomb is a well written account that reads as much like a mystery as a history. (I made a rhyme) It is dated, but that is the point. It is written at a point in time when the gaming industry had changed from a garage industry to a corporate juggernaut. Ms. Chaplin has done a very good job describing the frenetic energy of the game makers in their youth. She's captured the innate optism of creating then showed us the first stages of greif as the pioneers see the virtual world they created to create virtual worlds taken back into the real world. She deserves much credit for penetrating this male world and giving it's inhabitants their due. Many would have descended into cliche.Compelling writing. Important subject. Definitely worth the read. A sequel would be nice."
4,Great overview of video game history,"Smartbomb contains many details that I had not read before about the video game industry, especially the earliest games like Spacewar."
4,Superb Insights and Revelations from Game Land,"This book is very well written, with a fun and engaging style a bit similar to other great books like ""Hackers"" and ""Masters of Doom"". This one seems a bit as a rehash on those classic books, but it has its own merits. The best chapter is the one telling the Will Wright story, with the worst chapter being what should have been the best, talking about ""Dallas, the first person shooter capital"", they talked too much about game contests and less about the creators of the games.If you want a truly, superb, amazing and mind-blowing account of game making from grass-roots to success and downfall I must recommend ""Masters of Doom"". Its just the best one out there. Its my personal choice.That said, I enjoyed this book, the Will Wright story probably pays itself, and its a fair complement to my collection."
5,Gifted,"Excelent book with great descriptors and wonderful pictures of many, many flys to use in Alaska. Would also make a nice coffee table book."
3,"Mostly about baseball in Japan, not Gary!","If you're expecting to see ""The Best of Gary Carter"" in this video, you'll be very disappointed, as I was. You see Gary here and there, but mostly it's just about baseball in Japan in general."
1,Not even listenable ( if that is a word),"This was recommended to me, by a person that should know his music, but it is awful if you like classic blues. Save your money."
5,The Big Pay Back,"I'm very proud of the boys for putting this one out. It's a fitting tribute. Dan's love of Junior is real, and the result is a perfect blending of Junior and the Black Keys. If you ever spent a night at Junior's Juke Joint, in Chulahoma, then you know the meaning of psychadelic soul; and the boys captured that feeling perfectly. The music is primitive, hypnotic and sexual. If you want the same old, worn out 12 bar blues, don't buy this cd. If you want honest, raw and deeply felt blues, buy this cd, and another one by Junior himself. This music comes with the seal of approval from Junior's widow, Mildred. You can't get any higher praise than that. I have strong feelings about this one. I wish more musicians would try to pay back the elders who inspired them. Hat's off to Dan and Pat!!"
4,Junior Kimbrough Tribute,"This short album was a tribute to one of Dan Auerbach's biggest influences, which is Junior Kimbrough. These songs are covers of Junior's originals. Great Album."
5,"WinHelp - it's back from the dead, and doesn't require IE!","It is hilarious and telling that this book has been put back into print recently. That indicates how successful HTML Help has been as a standard (it's not cross-browser, not cross-platform, and not good for single-sourcing in a .chm and website, due to unresolved ActiveX objects). This book is the standard on WinHelp, which is officially back from the dead, and it's a fine book, covering principles of hypertext design, authoring tools, and the bells and whistles supported by the WinHelp viewer. The one patch needed for WinHelp, though, is Synchronize Table of Contents (and a persistent navigation window)."
2,Good for the beginner,"This camera has many excellent features that make it great for a beginner in the photography or digital camera realm, however it has a number of ""bugs"" that made it less than usable:It takes too long for the image to expose making any object in motion a blurry messThe button interface is simple but vague unless you happen to want to whip out the manual every time you press a button to figure out what it's trying to tell you.And finally, after all this I noticed a ""blind spot"" in the middle of all my pictures that even after a cleaning remained in place.Also, the product discription (at time of writing) doesn't mention that the unit lacks an LCD viewing screen.This might be good for someone looking to take a snapshot of an inatimate object, but not for much else. It would be great for people looking for a way to take pictures of things for an online auction etc..."
4,Good Fun,"Pros: Takes good pictures in sunlight, Use flash in low light. Easy to take movies and record sound. Good Webcam. Can use to take movies/pics when tethered to PC. Decent resolution (1.3 megapixel)Cons: Indoor pictures colours are not bright (when flash is not used). Cannot add extra memory card, 16 Mb on board fills up fast when taking movies. No Lens cap (could get dirty very easily)I had to reinstall programs (arcsoft photoimpression) which did not install properly first."
3,"In response to ""A CUSTOMER, from Fishkill, NY""","By SiPix records, ""A Customer"" wrote one e-mail to our support. In SiPix' response e-mail, our support department requested additional information and did not receive a response. If ""A CUSTOMER, from Fishkill, NY"" would like to have the camera repaired, ""A CUSTOMER"" simply needs to call our support at 510-651-9199."
3,It should be named StyleCam Deluxe For Kid!!,"I bought this Sipix Style for about a month ago it easy to use and I very impressed with the Video mode;however, it does not take a good quality picture with the low light environment and I had a difficult with downloading my picture to my laptop. I recommended this camera for kid or amature who need to have an experience of the Digital Camera."
2,KIDS CAM,"Good for Outdoor photos, Try Only in Day . When i saw the night photos really I was Disappointed Audio and video is good,of course for the price we are giving its good."
2,Not a good buy,"On the positive side: I liked the additions that came with the camera (software, cables, etc.) It was also easy to use and set up.On the negative side: the color was very bad. People's faces looked redder than normal, with blotchy whiteness where the light fell. It made my tan cat look greenish. Also, the pictures were way too sharp, which intensified the color problems. If you want decent pictures, don't get this camera."
2,Its OK,"I bought this camera for my daughter because she loves photography. She was very happy when I gave it to her. She later told me that the camera only has optical focus and that if you want to get a close up shot of something you have to literally get close to the person to get a close up shot.Pictures taken in poor light conditions come out with no colour and are blurry. It runs through batteries very quickly, and it doesn't use memry cards. So it is not a good camera to take on vacation, because if the batteries die your pictures are lost forever."
5,beautiful recoring,"This is a very bright recording. Cavalli is more ""tuneful"" than Monteverdi and (to my ear) more pleasing and graceful. The melodies are beautiful, the recitatives very expressive and filled with emotion, and the orchestra and the singers extremely good."
3,live performance from 1998,"For those that don't know Cavalli, he was successor to Monteverdi as the leading opera composer of his day and the style of his work closely resembles that of Monterverdi's two surviving later operas - Ulisse and Poppea.L'Orione (1653) is sandwiched between the three releases already recorded by Jacobs on Harmonia Mundi - Giasone (1649), La Calisto (1651) and Xerse (1654). Like Jacobs, Marcon attempts a more authentic reconstruction than the venerable Leppard recordings. It is lively and clean with a superb set of singers. Audience noise and recording is what you'd expect at a live performance - not to my taste but some prefer it.Mondo Musica provide Italian libretto and English synopsis. This does not compare well with the recent budget HMX re-releases of Giasone and La Calisto which contain translations, though Xerse was re-released earlier without any libretto."
1,These are not men's shoes!!!,"I received the order in the time promised HOWEVER, i ordered these shoes hoping for a men's 8 which fits me. BUT the shoes I received were women's shoes and were way too small. Very disappointed."
3,"Nice bag, but ...","This is a very nice laptop messenger bag. It's got plenty of room for a 15"" laptop and other goodies, cables, mouse, power brick, etc. However, the bag always seems to be front heavy and constantly tips over. Other than that, it's weatherproof and the padding keeps everything secure and protected."
3,Folklore,The Folklore book was in good condition upon its arrival. The description by the seller is accurate. We received it in a timely manner and are very pleased with the seller's response to our purchase.
5,Unusual collection,"Eclectic collection of folklore, mth, and legend. Missing some commonly obtainable information; many obscure and obstruse inclusions. A must for the person who wants an easily accessible assortment of information."
4,Scientific and educational,This video is appropriate for 10 years and up. It's a bit more scientific and technical than the IMAX Dolphin movie. It would be perfect for use as part of a classroom unit.
2,White Tea,"This tea does not taste or look like any white tea I have ever had, I will stick with silver needle in the future. Will not buy again."
