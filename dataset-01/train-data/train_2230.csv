3,Ok I bet these guys rip live,Disc is ok not something that I would listen to more than once but I have a feeling live they kick.
4,Superman Collection,This is a great collection. I watched all of these when I was younger and loved them and had to add this to my movie selection at home.
5,Great deal!,"It is more cost effective to get this ""The Christopher Reeve Superman Collection - (8-Disc Deluxe Special Edition)"" which is currently the same price as buying Superman Four Disc set and Superman II Special Edition seperately. So, you get films 3 and 4 practically free (which is better than paying for them, right?)However, I recommend the Ultimate Superman Collection over this which includes EVERYTHING. The special ediitons of Superman I, II, II, and IV. Plus the Richard Donner cut of Superman II, plus the new Superman Returns movie. There are additional discs with extra content like documentaries and short as well. Truly ""ultimate."""
4,Super Superman Collection,"Frankly I was not expecting a fantastic collection, technically, as most of the older Superman releases are pre Home Theatre time. However, the transfers were found to be quite good and we had no issue while playing them on multi-channel. With Sci-Fi genre it's actually important you see!However, IF the viewers compare the audio/video quality of this collection with the latest release (Superman Returns), then they'd definitely be disappointed! As the latest one is simply loaded!I personally feel that a booklet, paying tribute to Reeve, who had such a terrible end in his real life, must be included! Life's not been fair to him, but the producers can try to be!"
5,THE SUPERMAN REEVE SUPERMAN COLLECTION,THIS WAS ONE OF THE BEST GIFTS THAT SUPERMAN FAN COULD EVER GET. I LOVE IT . THANK YOU
5,Superman Series,My 5-year-old son and I are thoroughly enjoying the Superman Series. It is so kid friendly.
3,Miffed...,I was a little miffed that it didn't have the most recent Superman movie - then I slapped my hand on my forehead and realized the last movie didn't have Reeve in it. And this is the 'Reeve' collection duh!
3,Super Dud,"All I can say is that discs 2 and 3 were defective so I returned the product. The first movie was corny, but that's what I like about it. What I didn't like is the actress who played Lois Lane -- she annoyed me throughout the movie."
4,like it,Item just as describedcam packaged well- and just as expected.... if you are into these movies this is a good buy-I wanted my kids to see movies i wasthed when i was younger...
4,BEFORE ITS TIME,"There is no doubt in my mind that Christopher Reeve was the definitive Superman. He looks the part and found a human delivery of the character that makes you believe in Superman. It's a shame these movies weren't made with todays technology. The CGI effects would have enhanced these movie dramatically and made them amongst the best of it's genre ever. Superman I and II were outstanding entertainment, but III and IV fall short in the story line and make the total set a little weak. Still it's worth it to have the best representation of Superman ever captured on film and remember an exceptional actor who brought life to a legend. The extras, especially the screen tests, are interesting and well worth the time. It shows how important proper casting is. I can't imagine these movies with anyone else in the primary roles"
3,Super Reader,"Juve and offsider are trying to track down the dastardly villain.They think they have a lead through Lady Beltham, who, they presume, has actually seen Fantomas with his clothes off, so to speak.Getting close, they seem to have cornered him in a building.Blowing it up, with the pursuers inside, ""I win!"" Fantomas declares."
1,Poorly Designed Pencil AND Customer Service,"This unit was a pleasure to use until I had the need for higher temperatures. The pencil just can't handle the heat. It came apart at the metal/plastic junction on me 3 seperate times. Tech's at Cooper tools told me they had the problem fixed but clearly were miss-informed! Now, I'm struggling to get a returned phone call from them, my Amazon product return window has run out, and my 1 year warranty runs out soon...beware!"
1,DOA out of the box,"I just received my Weller WESD51 and it does not work. The iron does not get hot, and the temp display goes to 902 no matter what I set it to (max temp is 850, I believe). Not only disruptive and inconvenient, but another telling sign of ""American"" manufacturing. Should have bought the Hakko."
5,Awesome Unit!,This is my third soldering station and Weller knows how to make them right. The previous two were from different manufacturers and do not even compare to the quality let alone the price. Definitely worth every penny!
5,Highly Versatile,"Love this Weller WESD51 - it's a no thrills product - for a no thrills job, But it does do that job in style.The wand is very comfortable to use.. Changing out tips is a breeze - the stand is very heavy and sturdy and the temperature is ultimately controllable which helps to prevent damage to sensitive boards and components.Excellent - all you could need from a soldering iron set-up.."
4,Weller Soldering Iron,"Having bought a cheapo Radio Shack Iron, this one came as a realif. Very easy to use and a nice temperature setting. The only downside to this item is the socket that connects the iron to the soldering station, it is very cheap, loose and looks it would break easily."
4,Weller soldering iron,"This soldering is very good with one exception, the tips burn out much quicker than my old Weller without temperature control."
5,Quaility,I have several Weller irons. I find that I needed one with finer temperature control for surface mount work. This one is a great unit. It will serve me well for years to come as my other units have. Highly recommended!!
2,Not impressed,"Right out of the package, the tip of the soldering pencil is noticeably bent / burred. Additionally, the LED display flickers at 10-20Hz when the unit is on. In this price range, I expected better quality. Ordered a Hakko instead."
1,Weller not the same as it used to be...,"I bought a WESD51 station just over a month ago, and unpacked it. I did not actually try to use it until today due to a bunch of unrelated issues. When I plugged it in, meaning to do a little work, I found that the unit was dead. The tip wouldn't heat, and the displayed temperature was way off.Very disappointing... the Weller units of yesteryear were reliable. This DOA unit doesn't even have a front panel that fits (i.e., doesn't have a corner that sinks in when you press on it)Weller... what has happened to you?"
5,Rock solid soldering iron,Don't let the price fool you this one is great quality and would buy another if my soldering iron ever goes out. I own a soldering iron that cost twice as much and has been in use for years! bought this model for son who is an engineer and he raves about this unit!
2,Disappointed,I ordered these for my son who is having trouble with the times table. I was very disappointed that the pen did not come with it. I couldn't find anywhere in the description anything saying the pen did was not included. I think this was very misleading.
4,Great Recipes,This is a really great addition to any raw fooders library and an essential for the beginner. It really gives some wonderful and easy recipes that don't all require expensive kitchen gadgets to make. The marinated greens are the bomb!
1,Wrong item delivered,The description and picture for the item I was purchasing was a 4 port drop amplififer and I received a single port drop amplifier. So I am having to return the item received before using it.
3,I like It,I think this is a good mask. . I had to add some additional foam to fill out the nose and add definition to the face for a more personalized fit. The fit guide that came with the mask suggested to stuff with paper. I had foam so I used that.I did not have an obvious seam down the center but close inspection it is easy to find. I plan on adding another vent hole in front near my nose and mouth to complement the holes already present. I am also going to repaint the eyes. I think the eyes need no look down or forward not up ( personal preference ).
1,"Dark Cloud, not Sunny Fairy.","Don't buy this book. You will find it a saccherine drudgery, and you will find it has no ending unless you keep buying and buying and buying more and more books. Don't think of it as a sequel so much as a nasty cold that keeps coming back."
4,A good performance but lacking information,"I just began playing the CD's, and I am already disappointed. While I like the performance so far (as I do most of Neeme Jarvi's direction of Russian works), I was saddened by the exclusion of liner notes or a libretto. The enclosed notes only give a summary of each scene. Especially if I like a work, I want to know more about it. Reading David Brown's biography of Tchaikovsky in The New Grove _Russian Masters 1_ gives me a little background on the work, but the CD notes offers none. Why should I listen to it? What brought about its creation? What was contemporary opinion of the opera? What are the singers saying to each other? Inquiring minds want to know."
1,Poor Quality,Bought 3 scales for our internet business and 2 have stopped working after only 3 months. I would not purchase this product.
1,Defective,"Defective on receipt. Would self-test and zero only if the package table was removed. I don't intend to do that everytime I want to use the thing. Also, no software was included, though I don't know if it is really needed. Never got that far."
1,Could not get to work with Dymo Stamps / Edicia,"I tried to install this scale on 2 different Windows 7 computers. The driver comes up ""Elane UParcel 30lb"" rather than ""USPS PS311"". I use Dyno Stamps (Endicia) and it would not recognize the scale since I assume its looking for USPS PS311. I sent the scale back to Amazon for a refund."
2,"Despite search for ""Endicia"" & ""scale"" it does NOT work with Endicia","This scale works fine- it's very accurate, however, I found it while searching for a scale that would work with Endicia/Dazzle- it doesn't work. So, if you're an Endicia user- don't buy this one."
1,Not working,"When I first turned on the scale it started weird digital activity which ended with ""1-1"" on the display. I was not able to get rid of this 1-1 on my own, and there was no comprehensive user guide for the product. Later playing with the scale I discovered that it only zeroes up being turned on in upside down position. Since I bought it on clearance I could not return it without a restocking fee, so I decided to keep it. For a while the upside down trick worked, but now it is back to 1-1. I would not recommend this item. I would recommend to add another 50$ and buy really nice reliable 330 lbs scale from USPS."
1,Starting over,"This was a ridiculous story. Obviousely the author is a very unsettled person looking for love in all the wrong places. However, is this the men in her life or is it really the authors problem. How many men does one women need to go through before she finds the right one. Perhaps she is looking for a rich man to take care of her, or would prefer just being arm candy until she is done with them. This was a waste of reading material and I did not find it amusing at all."
1,Save your $.99,"Not my idea of poetry, read part or all of most of the pieces, waste of a dollar, deleted within 10min of opening."
5,An Outstanding Adventure - Excellent reading,"Wow! This book places you right there, there in the desert. You can feel the heat, see the the old west as it was and what it has become. Wilcox seems to take you on a trip without you ever leaving your seat. This books makes you want to pack up your vehicle and head to the desert. But don't leave home without the book, you'll get lost in that vast sea of sand without it. Read this book and you'll enjoy what the California desert really has to offer. Water, water,water, please!"
3,Wonderful if you have four wheel drive,"The previous review material misses the question which underlies this book: where can I go with my 4 wheel drive vehicle?If you have one of those, it's a lyrical, well written exposition, concentrating mostly (75%) on the northern (Mojave) desert.The author has an aversion to the web. In the ""how to get there"" sections, he gives phone numbers and postal addresses. Who in the 21st century is going to write a letter for information? Finally in the back of the book, he breaks down and includes a few web sites but I don't recall an email address anywhere.Unfortunately I don't have 4 wheel drive so, other than admiring the writing, the book was of limited use to me."
2,Very disappointed...,"I had expected much more, so perhaps the problem was that I had great expectations. I grew tired of the stories and sometimes felt that the author was whining -- we all have days like that -- but I grew weary of the style. With the comparisons to Erma Bombeck I was expecting more. The author is no Erma Bombeck."
4,"Great, except for near the end of it","I liked most of this book alot. Thought provoking and vivid telling of his experiences from child through adult. But the epilogue gets a little out there for me. It was very hard to stay with it and figure out what the hell he is really talking about for several pages near the end. A little over my head there. But hey, that's me...i'm not a ""genius"" like the reviewer on the back cover said he was."
5,A must read for every IT Executive,"A plain english review of what internet security means to the enterprise. There is enough information to educate without overwhelming the less-than-technical. If you are wondering if your company's internet connections are as secure as they need to be, this is the book for you. It is filled with references to helpful sites and software as well as guidelines for coming up with a security policy that fits any type of organization.Techies: Haven't been able to get your decision makers to listen to your security concerns? Buy them a copy of this book."
5,"My mom said ""read this"" and she was right again!","My mom gave me this book for Mother's Day. She's fun like that. She said that Lydia and Jessica, the mother and daughter in the book, reminded her of our relationship. Hm. So I read the book and was surprised to see that a male writer could capture a mother and daughter relationship so well. It was pretty amazing: the way they fought, the passive-aggresive stuff, the resentment, communication, and the love too. It's complicated and delicate and Shreve obviously understands that. The book turns out to be a family novel with quiet and powerful emotion. There's humor, too - loved the Spiveys! - and it all adds up to something that kind of hums. I'm passing this book on to my best friend, who has an even more complicated relationship with her mother."
3,boring drive,"This book sounded so much better than it really was. It was slow, boring and confusing. The main character needed serious counseling, and her children needed a kick in the pants. Very disappointing."
3,Not what I expected,"This book was okay, but not what I expected based on the review in my local paper. I was expecting more humor and less pathos. Lydia seemed pathetic at times, not someone I could relate to very well."
2,Soft,Not what I expected. Very soft and goofy. I thought that Lydia's character was pathetic and needy and just not likable. Reminds me of Elizabeth Berg's later writing. I can't recommend it. Brought back memories of Huntington Woods and Royal Oak.
3,Window Fan,"Works as well as it should for the $18 I spent on it. I thought that the fan would have and intake and an exhaust fan...however, you have to spin the unit around in the window to take advantage of it. All in all keeps the air moving through my apartment."
2,Holmes 7 Twin Window Fan,It served a purpose. I wish I didn't have to turn it around to have it blow the opposite way though. It's smaller than the other one I have and not as great.
4,"Great, but a little noisy","Very good product. The double fans are excellent because they really do move the air. I bought this as an exaust fan to get rid of smoke, and it does the job just fine. The reason for the four instead of five stars is because it is sort of noisy - but I like that because, for me, it's ""white noise."" But, for under $20, it's really good."
2,Not worth it.,Just like any product you get what you pay for and in this case that was more true than I would have liked. Bought this in April 2012 and one of the fans stopped working in July 2012. Not even 6 months. I got nothing against Holmes and will still consider their better quality fans. Just expect much of this even if treated well.
1,Don't buy this Fan!,"This type of fans is working for fresh air only and it doesn't work for exhaust!The add is misleading also it is noisy!Holmes 7 Twin Window Fan, HAWF2021-U"
4,Not perfect but makes a big difference,"It doesn't fit perfectly flush in the window, nor is it the absolute sturdiest construction, but it is a sanity-saver on a hot summer day for a small kitchen."
2,Works... Sorta,"I have a fairly small room, so I thought this fan would do the job, but not quite. I use it as just a fan, not in the window sill and it's alright."
4,"Great fan, great price.","This is a great fan especially for the price. Fairly sturdy construction. I've dropped it a few times without breakage. Decent power but only good for a small sized room, which was my need. No real complaints."
1,another junk window fan,"Fits most windows is right. only fits windows 1 1/2 inches or smaller, windows with a larger diameter window will not sit flat on the top of the window fan frame.Has no separator between the front and back of the housing and fan blades, so it is not vary powerful or efficient.Due to the cheap manufacture, I do not see the point in looking at more expensive fans as I would have to imagine they are all made the same now, which is to say they are all junk.I know everyone wants to take the easy way out today and for the most part everyone is just plain lazy, but why make such a cheap fan ?I would rather pay more for a quality product, but their is no point when the more expensive fans look to be made the same way."
2,Two months and one fan crapped out,"Had the fan 2 months and one of the fans crapped out on me. For the price I expected at least a year. Pretty noisy though so we had to keep the TV turned up louder. Glad autumn is here we won't need it as much. Will buy a new one in a few months. San Diego is always pretty nice, but our apartment does not get enough cross ventilation so it really helped when it was hot. Oh well, what do you expect for 25.00?"
4,Great for what it is,"It's a great fan for what it is. It was cheap at the time. It fits the windows in our townhome perfectly. Much better than our other window fan (same brand) It's a little noisy even on the low setting, but I would rather have the noise and save on my electric bill by not having to turn on A/C"
1,Worst window fan ever,"I didn't figure I needed to spend $50-$60 for a window fan, so when I saw that at about $25 I thought it was a good deal. After all a fan is a fan and saving $25 was a good thing. Well, as they say, you get what you pay for and this fan is so cheap that I almost threw it in the trash after the first time I used it.Problem: You want to reverse the direction of the flow: Take it out of the window and turn it around!Problem: We have standard size double hung windows. It doesn't fit. Even with the extension, its too narrow.Problem: The top and the bottom don't fit in the window frame.Problem: It doesn't push very much air.Suggestion: Don't buy this fan."
1,Good fan for two weeks,"It was a good fan for the two weeks it lasted. Sure, the item description says 36"" when it actually extends to a maximum of 33""; sure, the description says reversible which really just means you can take it out and turn it around in your window. I can live with that for the price - I just wanted a fan that works. This one fit the bill just fine for two weeks, when it stopped working and smelled as if the smoke locked inside somehow got out. Attempts to get the smoke to go back in (including inspecting the fuse in the plug) proved futile. I would be surprised if I turned it on more than 8 or 9 times, running it for less than 8 hours each time. Look elsewhere!"
1,Item not as described,"This does not have a reverseable motor, nor does it have individual controls for each fan."
1,not very good,"We have this fan. We bought it because we have another Holmes window fan that has oscillating fans with adjustable speeds and directions that we LOVE. But this fan spins and spins and does barely anything. I can stand a foot in front of this fan and feel no breeze at all. Last night, it was in the 60's outside, and I put this fan in the window to help cool the house. Nothing. Buy a different Holmes fan--this one is a clunker."
3,not a feature,"i've only had the fan for a day, so i can't really review on durability. i HAVE to comment on this though:the box and the product description say ""Other features include a manual reverse function...""yeah. it's called turning the fan around and facing it the other way. ALL FANS HAVE THAT. it's not a feature.ridiculous."
2,Works well while it lasts (not long),"I turn this handy fan on every day when I get home around 7-8pm and leave it running till I leave the house at 7am. I've been using it for a little over two months and it worked just fine (perhaps even better than expected) for a fan like this. The flow was strong, it kept me cool at night and kept the fresh air circulating easily in my apartment.Unfortunately, it did not even last the summer before I woke up to the smell of smoke and saw that one of the fans had burnt out and was barely moving. To reduce the risk of a fire, I clipped the two power leads leading to it and left the other fan running on low. I will reach out to Amazon and the company to see if there is anything they are willing to do about it, but for such a short lifetime, I am very disappointed in this promising product."
3,cheap window fan,"This was the least expensive window fan available with Prime shipping at the time I bought it for 29.47. It works as well as you'd expect, but it is pretty loud. Changing the speed from HI to LO doesn't really make it any quieter, it just changes the pitch of the noise. Other than that it works fine."
3,"""manual reverse function"" means flip it in the window","I just installed it. 1 it was too narrow to fit my windows, which are a standard size. I've got a gap on either side. In order to make it fit, I would have to buy additional extender panels. I won't waste my money.But the biggest thing was that the "" manual reverse function to take hot air out of a room"" is you take it out of the window and flip it. There are also controls on both side, which seem to me could cause an electrical issue in the rain..I've got it on reverse right now, so we'll see how it does."
5,"Holmes may be cheap, but they make good stuff","I have two of these, and used them hard for YEARS before one of them finally konked out. They were very cheap, but have worked extremely well over the years, and I'll gladly purchase another when my budget allows. They move the air nicely, and while they do make a bit of noise, it isn't all that annoying - I've heard far, far worse! Great bargain for the price."
3,Not as useful as I had hoped,"The fans don't have a reverse switch, so exhausting air (useful after a hot summer day) is a matter of unplugging it and turning it around, then re-mounting it in the window. If you don't unplug it you'll twist the cord tighter and tighter over time, eventually breaking the connections to the motor.Beyond that big fat nuisance, it works well, has good air-volume capacity. My advice is to spend the few dollars more it will take to get a fan with reversing capacity, and ideally a dual-blade which allows bi-directional airflow."
3,Works ok but loud,This fan works fine but its quite a bit louder than the other window fans I have owned in the past. Also the two sides can't be controlled independently like the other I had could.
2,What you would expect for under $30,"We bought this fan specifically for the kitchen so we could exhaust smoke (etc) while cooking. I knew we didn't need anything great, and this fan is just that. It moves air and has NO extras. Its a little loud, the fan blades are small, and it only has 2 speed settings. The ""biggest"" deal is you have to physically turn it around in the window. We've had a ""good"" Bonaire window fan in our bedroom (...) which is fantastic and has tons of features. If you want something nice for a room, I'd highly recommend that. If you just need a very cheap window fan for a use like ours in the kitchen, this will work."
3,Window fan,"Haven't used it yet. Had to fix wiring problem that burned out the original fan as well as the TV, VCR, radio and clock on same circuit."
1,Please listen to the negative comments,I should have paid more attention to the negative comments. This is a piece of crap. Worked just once. PLEASE DO NOT BUY THIS CRAPPY PRODUCT.
2,ok. But not worth it.,"The fan did not fit any of my windows with the plastic extender and the acordian screen. I gave it to my boyfriend and it didn't fit his either. We do not have unusually large size windows. I would carefully review the maximum sizes before buying. As for the sound.. i didn't mind it, but I'm a sound sleeper. My boyfriend could not stand it."
2,Died within a year,I used it in the kitchen to vent the smoke from cooking. It's not very effective but better than no vent. This thing is pretty loud. Worked OK for close to a year and died.
5,Great fan and works,Great fan and it works and it is nice i did not have any problem got it fast and it took me less then a muinte to put it togtherBuy it no issue in my sideThank you
3,Bought 3 & use them annually,"Got 3 and they're in the windows every spring & fall. The last one bought just this spring and one of the two fan motors stopped working after a few days. Bought from a big box store for around $25, going to return for an exchange since it's a great fan when it works right. Certainly wouldn't pay more than $25 anywhere, but good fan for that price. The previous 2 I have still work great and never had a problem with them. Typically run them 24-7 in spring & fall, so the old ones have held up. Maybe quality has degraded over the years. Would have given 5 stars if not for the 1 in 3 failure rate I've experienced."
4,"Not a terrible fan, but...","It only has the two speed setting, and while one is high and the other is low, there doesn't seem to be much difference and both pretty much feel like medium. It was simple to install, though the accordion-like extension part is a pain and even with that plus the hard slide on extender piece, it didn't go completely across my window. That isn't a huge deal though. I like that if you flip it around, there's also a switch on the other side. So not a bad fan, it gets the job done, but if you want something with a lot of power to blow hard, this probably wouldn't be the one for you. It works for me though."
4,this fan sucks.....or blows! Perfect for what I need!,"Adequate fan for what I needed. Plenty of power. To reverse flow just turn it around in the window switch on both sides. 2 speeds, no temp control, but I'm using it to suck air out of my room not to keep cool.Arrived within 2 days of ordering. A bit louder than my old fan, but not bad."
5,Excellent fan,The fan works great it brings the cool air inside to cool down your room. I wouldn't recommend you using when it's hot outside.
4,Good deal.,"This fan works very well for a small room. It's not terribly powerful and the blades are not reversable, but it's quiet and very inexpensive. I have it in a child's room and it's perfect. Now my son wants one in his room."
3,"Loud Fan, Does not really fit 35"" window","Even on the low speed this fan has a fairly loud and high pitched whine. Impossible to sleep with it on.Also, I bought this fan because it stated it would fit up to 36 inch window. My window is 35 inches and even with the extender it is over an inch too short. I am glad I can use it with the existing screen. Overall, not to impressed."
2,Holmes Fan,"The Holmes window fan was not what I had in mind. I tried to return it only to find Amazon did not take returns on Holmes Fans. My fault, didn't read return policy for Holmes fans. Beware of that.Holmes would not let me return it to them for a refund. Fortunately, Amazon allowed me to return it to them if I paid the shipping. Then they credited me for the shipping cost also. So, thanks to Amazon, it worked out ok for me in the end."
1,DON'T PUT THIS IN A FIRST STORY WINDOW,"This fan is not a safe choice for a first story window.Just push in the fan, and you've broken into the house !!I returned it."
2,Sounds like an air show,"Some other reviews here nailed it right on the head: this fan sounds like a squadron of screaming jets, or something you would hear in an indoor skydiving park. It's not the decibel level that is so bothersome, it's the whiney high pitched jet engine sounding whirl that comes from this unit even in the lowest setting. You get what you pay for, so now I'm trying the $40 Honeywell, the extra 20 bucks would be worth not having to listen to this air show in my bedroom."
1,"It ""works""","This little fan ""works"" but for how long? I can't believe how cheaply it is made. Plastic... Nothing but cheap flimsy plastic.Another poorly made product from CHINA. You know... China, the country we sold our souls to.Amazon should require that the country of origin be listed on all products. That would really help me to avoid Chinese made junk."
1,Fan not working,Hello seller this fan is not working. I try many things. i thought it had 1 years manufacture warranty. Please email and i dont know what to do with it. Thanks
1,DANGER!,"Holmes 7 Twin Window Fan, HAWF2021-UI have I believe THIS fan for my living room. It has two fans that you can control to exhalst or blow IN house. Its ALSO has a temperature setting that you can set so it goes off and on as temperature reachers its goals.HERE IS A POSSIBLE BAD PROBLEM. IF ANYONE HAS THIS TYPE MODEL CEHCK THIS OUT YOURSELF!Plus the unit in. turn it on to see if it works. If it does work then turn the unit OFF. BUT LEAVE it PLUGGED in. About an hour or two later the unitl gets HOT to the touch right at teh TOP, FACE of the unit. Right about the button on mine that controls it. Mine also has a lite bottom that says 70Degrees at this area. ITS HOT even when unit is NOT turned on! JUST plugged in! TRY IT you will unplug it like I do now."
5,Very Pleased,"We bought one of these a year ago to put in our loft which becomes extremely hot in the summer. Fits all the windows we have tried it in perfectly thanks to the accordian style side panel. It is relatively quiet and moves a lot of air. It was great for us because while the central AC was running and cooling only the bottom two floors, we were able to turn this fan around and use it to create an upward draft to get more cool air to flow higher in our townhouse while pushing the hot air accumulating in the top loft out. Still works great after 4 full seasons of use (2 springs, summer and autumn). Highly recommend this fan if you are looking for a window unit."
5,Love it,"For the price, its unbelievable. I usually have it on low so its not too noisy, but high isn't that noisy either. Kinda wish it had a medium setting but all in all VERY satisfied."
3,"Simple, Works Well for a while...","Very simple to setup...Uses just under .5 Amps @ Low, and about 3/4ths Amp at High speed.Far more cost efficient than using a window air conditioner when it's already cooler outside.Bought 2 of them from Amazon... seemed like a decent price... and I'm very happy with them so far.Several months later, they generally seem to fall apart and one or both of the fans stop working due to likely too much moisture. If you're attentive enough to take them out of the window before it rains it'd probably last longer."
5,Decent for what its worth!,"I purchased this about 3-4 months ago and have not experienced any problems with this item. Although one little problem that I wish I didn't have is that this window fan does not completely fit into my window. I have to kind of try to make it fit but never takes me more than a few seconds to set it up even with that issue. If you plan to leave it in and it doesn't fit, you may have to tape up the openings so that it is more efficient. Either way, I got what I paid for and it does what I need it to do!"
2,not bad but very low suction,"Pros-fits well into window, light weight and easy installation, arrived quickly, reasonable price but not for the power of fan.Cons-Much lower suction than I expected, even at high setting very little air movement, I would not buy this item again or recommend it."
4,It turns. It moves air. It's a fan.,"This little twin window fan will move quite a bit of air. Just set it in the window and pull out the expandable sliding accordion-style fitting. There's an extra piece of plastic to fit on the other side of the fan for wide wide windows. Just turn the fan around to reverse the direction of air flow.Runs great. It may not last forever (my little Holmes desk fan just gave up the ghost after 20+ years, bad wire and no way to get inside to repair it), but at the price it's no big deal."
3,"Does what it says it will, and for the right price.","Bought this because it was the cheapest one I could find. Really, who needs a fan with a remote and a reversing motor and all that other stuff? Not me, and I'm betting most other people don't, but they buy it anyway for more money cause they haven't found this one yet.Also, the motors are supposed to be water resistant, so you can leave it in the window while it's raining. I'd be more worried about my rug than the fan if it were raining with the window open."
1,Pffft!,"This book is a crock and none of the spells work. If you are only looking for a quick giggle, this book is for you. Otherwise, don't waste your money like i did"
1,Dreadful!,"This book is absolutely dreadful! Not only is it silly, but nothing works. If it were possible to give negative stars, this book would surely deserve it."
4,Sometimes the path doesn't lead where you think.......,"The second book in The Reardon Brothers Series introduces you to Noah, a lawyer who has sworn off women. Then along comes Jessica and what can he do but save her from her father and take her back to her unknowing family in Baltimore.Dianna Crawford does a great job of showing you the differences between frontier life and ""high society"" in the late 1700's through Jessica's eyes. You will love Noah's honor and his quest to bring Jessica happiness, and cheer when Jessica realizes where her heart truely lies. You will also look at salt with new appreciation!I have enjoyed many of this author's books and this is a wonderful follow up to the first in the series, Freedom's Promise."
5,Elegant and Unique Wedding Cake Topper,"Getting married at the beach soon, I wanted to have a beach themed wedding without being corny. I was thrilled how beautiful and elegant the topper was when it arrived! It looked much more expensive than it was and it was an excellent choice."
4,There OK,I didn't give it a five star rating because their lighter in weight then others I purchased.Other than that the birds like them.
3,OK - Birds are not crazy about it....,"This stuff is OK. On the plus side, it lasts forever outside because the birds only eat it when they have no other options. But they like my homemade suet cakes way better. You put the homemade out there with the store-bought and it's no contest - they flock to the homemade but leave the store-bought for when they're really desperate. So, I guess I'll use it up, but not sure if I'll ever reorder - unless I get sick of making the homemade stuff."
1,Poor workmanship,"The pants came, in the mail. I tried them on, they fit. There was nothing visually wrong with them. I put them in the wash. When I put them on, I noticed a seperation about 4"" long, in the outer seam, above the left knee. Because they fit nice, I disposed of the paper work, before I washed them. I sent an e-mail, to the company. They claim I damaged them.Bob"
5,Hey Guys this is Perfect for your Sandblast Cabnet exhuast.,This Gate works perfect as a gate for a shop vac conected to a sandblast cabnet.You can sandblast in your shop or garage in the winter and set the shop vac outside.Worked great for my needs. I got 2 of them on for my inside wall and one for the outside siding. I cut an old extention wand and it fit in between the two. Now sandblasting set up is allways ready!100% Perfect!
3,Bulletproof,"My 13 yo twin wanted this game. Not too crazy about the content of it tho. Its so typically ""b---k""!!"
3,Be Carefull,I didn't realize these had liquor in them. I ate four of them and made a pass at my wife. She threw the rest of them in the trash. Stay away from these if you can't handle your liquor. Next year I'll stick with the chocolate Twinkies.
5,LAMB watch,"Unless you can find this watch under 200 dollars, then this is your best deal. Any retail store will carry this, but at a higher price."
2,not reviewed yet.,It was a gift to my grandson so I actually haven't reviewed it. He likes them so I'm sure he will this one also.
4,just like when i was a kid,i can not wait for the next season love it as much as i did when i was a kid
5,Full House Season 5,"Full House The Fifth Season was one of Jodie Sweetin's funnist seasons. Although in my opinion Jodie was at her most funniest in the sixth season but she was a really outstanding comedine this year. Her insults to kimmy were classic. 9 or 10 year old Jodie this season played Stepanie to perfection. And now that she is starting to get older she is an even better actress. She shined in alot of episodes this year. My favorite episodes with her this fifth year are Take My Sister Please, Gotta Dance, Sisters in Crime, Crushed, and Spellbound. Jodie shows what she does best, performing phenomenonmly like a great actress should. Her staigntend hair with those adorable bangs and her natural beauty kicks but."
4,"Good show, but same old DVD packages","I have input similar reviews on the DVD packages for the first 4 seasons of the show.I like the show. I started watching it in reruns several years ago.Enjoyable. Does steal idea from other shows, repeat actors in different roles. But, it is enjoyable.What I am going to write here I have written on my previous reviews for seasons 1 to 4. WHERE ARE THE EXTRAS? NONE of the packages have had any extras like talking to the actors. I have ALWAYS wanted to see this on any of the seasons.It seems to me the makers of the show do NOT care about the fans when they do not include extras on the DVD packages."
5,Full House 5,"Personally I think Full House is a great show. Today many shows are focused around sex and drugs but Full House is a clean show that everyone can enjoy. I own the first four seasons and love to watch reruns on ABC Family and Nick@Nite. Full House, fifth season, is a great Christmas present for any fan. I myself hope to find it under the tree on Christmas day! A MUST BUY!!"
3,Bad Disk,"While I LOVE Full House, I am pretty upset that my first disk of this season did not work. I tried 3 DVD players and my computer. Make sure to check yours as soon as you get the package."
5,I love Full House!,"I finally have another one of the Full Hose seasons that I really prefer. This is just one of them. I can see that this season has more episodes than most of the other seasons. Hey, the more the merrier! Anyway, if you are a Full house fan and would love to have this season, ask your Amazon dealer to mail these in for you. You may never know what you are missing! Buy this and any other Full house season you may love."
5,Who could forget - TOMMY PAIGE!!!!!!!!!!!,"This season was the peak of Full House for me. The later seasons seem to lack the same sort of spirit as the previous ones. It became far too centered on Michelle. I always thought Stephanie was the most interesting character - she was old enough to remember her mom, but young enough that she still needed or wanted a mother figure. My favorite episodes this season include ""Crushed"" when Tommy Paige comes to sing Stephanie on her birthday (a pretty decent song I might add) and ""Gotta Dance"" where Stephanie thinks about spending all of her time dancing. After this season, Stephanie was cast to the side for other characters that took more attention (Nicky, Alex, Michelle, and even D.J.) Oh well."
4,good for clinicians in the orthopedics field,"Its good enough for clinicians to understand the musculoskeletal imagenology, its a good way to start..."
4,A very good book for residents,"This book has almost everything you need for your Radiology residence, particularly the first years. It's easy to read and has good images and schemes. I think the introductory chapters and those about arthritis are particularly good. This textbook covers aspects of conventional radiology as well as MRI, although the latter could be improved, I believe. In that sense, you may want to complete your MK library with Kaplan's MK MRI and then you'll have everything a general radiologist could need and should know about musculoskeletal diagnostic imaging."
1,The weak link in the Requisites series,"I am a big fan of the Requisites series of texts. In general, they are some of the best introductory radiology textbooks available, with great organization and well selected content. However, the Musculoskeletal Requisites has little in common with the other books. It is organized into a series of neverending lists, which, while perhaps suitable for a study guide, make the reading of the book a chore. While none of the Requisites books are definitive texts, this one has more holes in its content than the others as well. Hopefully the book will be completely revamped for the second edition. I can't recommend it in its present form."
4,The Over-View on Dolley,"As the bicentennial of the War of 1812 will be acknowledged and re-conidered, so interest in that fascinating lady at the heart of the storm, DOLLEY MADISON will be sparked This biography by an accomplished writer might offer a good introduction to Dolley's times and her life. It's easy reading and there are lots of drawings and illustrations illustrations that one doesn't find in other biographies. A reader might not quite capture her heart and her inner-thinking during the pivotal summer of 1814 when Washington burned ... but the story is here ... and well-told."
2,Got whiplash trying to go back and forth but still lots of good facts!,"This book was at least not a completely sterile historical work. I have always been interested in the life of Dolley Madison. While it's clear that Mr. Cote' loves history and is excellent at fact gathering, I felt this book was poorly constructed, which is a shame, given the wealth of material. Still, not a bad book to read to glean more information on a very important woman in history."
1,Keep looking!,"This book provided no useful information about 6 sigma. The content of the book could be distilled into a single paragraph, at most. I am a chemical engineer, and I am working on my MBA. I bought this book because I am looking to become six sigma certified as well. This book was no help. It mentioned 4 or 5 terms that I am well acquainted with, like DOE's, but it didn't explain them at all. Plus, the book presented through a boring narrative."
4,excellent resource,"This is an excellent introductory source for the beginning returning or experienced preschool teacher. Skills for Pre School Teachers is clear and consice written in laymans terms. It offers many resources for activites and offers titles of material for further research. This text is user friendly filled with hands on assignments and check listsd that can be adapted to almost any classroom setting. I would higly reccommnend this text for beginners, staff development as well as seasoned professionals."
3,how to talk to your child about sex,"just reading, its does not really give example of gay families info and the difference in beginnings of some of their children and adopted children................but i am going to finish book and use some of the info which is good concerning saving yourself for your special someone for life"
1,The Opposing View,"While the other reviewers gushed over this book, I found it useful only if one wishes to pass along to their children the uptight and puritanical values that represent everything that is wrong with attitudes about sex in this country. The section about masturbation in which it is suggested that boys should refrain from too much masturbating in order to ""save up"" for the wife of his dreams would be laughable if it wasn't so disturbing.The section on homosexuality is also disturbing as well as offensive. I pity any children who happen to be non-heterosexual who are taught by this book. If you are interested in teaching your children about tolerance, acceptance, and the value of diversity, this is NOT the book for you."
2,It's Just Ok,"I guess I was expecting a lot more than the fantasy advice of the world is perfect stuff in the book. I'm sorry I'm from an area that telling my child at the age of 8 that sex is something good, wonderful and exciting is so not a good idea. It's too much of a cookie cutter, we are a perfect family, television episode type of stuff in there. I have to admit there were one or two things I was able to take away from it."
1,Too Religious for me,"""how a loving God made things work together""...they should know better than to co-mingle their supernatural views with the already tricky subject at hand."
4,A good starting point,"While this book is written for those beginning their exploration into the use of pressure points, it also provides a useful reference for those who have been studying longer and want to be able to refresh their knowledge of the locations, angle/direction, and activation methods of some of the more commonly-used points.Is it the end-all, be-all of pressure point books? No... but then, if such a book exists, I've never found it. Is it a good primer and reference book? Absolutely, and I have recommended it to many of my own students."
4,the rewiew,This book is only intended for younger kids like ages 5-11+ and is awesome for that age group. However this is the worst book of self defence i've seen but im just keeping in mind its awesome for Younger people ONLY. If you want to learn realistic and effective self defence buy another book.
5,Without Limits is one of the best running movies out there.,Prefontaine is portrayed very well. The movie captures enough racing to be exciting and also develops a plot. Pre is one of the most important athletes of our time and is deserving of movies as good as this one. The actors and actresses do an extraordinary job of portraying a star in our sport. Without Limits is simply a great movie.
3,Not Quite The Same,"I thought this movie was pretty good. The music, diolauge, and actors are alright but not like ""Prefontaine."" This movie's Mac Wilkins looks like some hippie not like Mac Wilkins. Steve's roomate wasn't obsessed with scriptures and Billy Cudrup looks more like a Prefontaine wannabe instead of Prefontaine. James Leto was much more convincing. However, the racing was good and the plot was alright but it showed him more as a good guy than the real prefontaine. He was a little drunk when he crashed but this movie doesn't show it. Also, the racing wasn't quite as exciting as in ""Prefontaine."" However this movie does move a little faster than the other and works well as a pump-up movie."
5,PHAT movie,"This is my favorite movie of all time. Pre is such a pimp. Without Limits was, in my opinion, similar in style to Days of Thunder. WATCH THIS MOVIE!"
2,Not near as good as Prefontaine,"Donald Sutherland had his moments, but Lee Ermey was a better Bowerman. I liked Jared Leto better than Billy Crudup as Steve. Prefontaine was more inspirational and seemed to follow the documentary more closely. Save your 2 hours and watch Prefontaine."
4,"Good movie, gets boring towards the end",I enjoyed this movie. Steve Prefontaine is my hero. My track team watched this movie in our hotel room at the Simplot Games. It could have lost the sexual content (that would have boosted my rating.) The race footage was excellent. Billy Crudup and Donald Sutherland are absolutely fantastic. This movie is very clever and is a must have for any Prefontaine fan.
5,The greatest running legend of all time,I have not seen this movie yet. But i have been waiting for a year for it to finally come out. I just finally found the first prefontaine. i searched for 2 years.If you are a serious runner you will love the guts of Steve Prefontaine. Someone who was never meant to be a runner. Small one leg shorter than the other. Thats Steve Prefontaine. Someone who no one ever thought could do it. He beat the odds and could have been the greatest runner ever. I believe that if the tragic car crash never happened that he would have been the best.
5,This movie helps to reveal the true Steve Prefontaine,"Some have said that Steve Prefontaine is cocky and self centered. Unfortunately even more people believe this. It is not wrong to believe in ourselves.The biography ""PRE"", told the story; but the movie Without Limits made that story come to life. Steve Prefontaine is a runner who demands our admiration, because of his awesome accomplishments. By the end of the movie everyone is able to believe. Believe in the man, and the runner, Steve Prefontaine. Believe in themselves. Believe that when someone gives everything they have to something, including their heart, anything is possible."
2,This is ok. Buy Prefontaine instead.,"This movie has its ups and downs, and has alot of unneccesary sex scenes. Draggy in places and is sometimes boring. Buy Prefontaine, it has cooler racing segments and is just and overall better portrayal of Steve Prefontaine. It is very clean besides the language and is a great buy. I reccomend Prefontaine over this."
3,Comes up short...,"Tom Cruise, Producer, should have seen to it that this biopic better fulfilled its subject matter. The story of Prefontaine is an inspirational one, for sure, but this seemingly ""TV movie"" version of the great distance runner's life, doesn't exploit either the heart of a human story, nor the excitement of competition. To compare this film with ""Chariots of Fire"" is ludicrous.I suspect that this DVD will most appeal to devoted runners, like myself. It doesn't offer much for the rest of the movie going audience.Releasing the DVD could have provided the filmmakers with a great opportunity to punch up the appeal of the Prefontaine story by including some special features, such as a commentary track by some of the real-life professional who knew and worked with him (ie. Frank Shorter).Distance runners are constantly advised to pace themselves. This work could have done with more front running!"
2,A Pre not at his best,"This movie was good....if you don't like to receive factual information. This movie was way too Hollywood-ized to be enjoyable to someone who thinks the real Prefontaine is anyone noteworthy. The plot was shaky, and didn't come close to the actual person Pre was. If you want to see a good Pre movie, try the one called ""Prefontaine."" It's much better and is factual!"
5,"Great movie, great service!","This is one of my favorite and most inspirational movies that I have ever seen. I too am a runner and agree with the way that Pre ran and thought. If you are a sports fan of any type, you will love this movie!"
2,Fred Astaire & Ginger Rogers,"This import is titled ""Fred Astaire & Ginger Rogers"" but the photo on the cover is Fred but that isn't Ginger Rogers!It is Marjorie Reynolds who danced with Astaire (and Bing Crosby) in ""Holiday Inn."""
4,"Snug Fit, Great Price!","Snug fit, but holds Sony 8-inch Portable DVD Player and all accompanying accessories, as well as a several DVD's. Well constructed case. Great price!"
4,too small for 8.5 inch screen,"Purchased as recommended when ordering DVD player. Nice case, lots of storage, but too small for my 8.5 inch screen DVD player. Had to return."
1,Great Bag!!,"I LOVE THIS BAG!!! I can fit: 24 movies in the protective sleeves, an 8 in. portable DVD player, my headphones, my car and home chargers, and I still have an extra pocket for whatever else I want. The look is gorgeous and everyone that has seen this bag has to stop me and ask what is in it, it's that cool looking. If you need a cute, stylish looking, bag to carry your movies and player in this is the bag you want. Hands down great bag."
5,a really good buy,"This product ended up being awesome. I was skeptical because the price was low. I took a chance anyway and I was really glad I did. My dvd player fit. There's plenty of room for dvds in the back sleeves. There's a front pocket to house cords and headphones and that stuff. I am incredibly happy with this purchase. I'd say, do your measurements and if it will fit your dvd player, then buy this. It's worth it."
2,A Bit Too Small,"I was excited to get a case that holds my player, accessories and some movies but was unpleasantly surprised by the size. I have only a 7"" player and it does not fit in this case. The case realistically will fit my digital camera. I recommend this if you have a very small player or for a CD Walkman but not if your player measures more than 6"". Otherwise, it appears very functional and a good value."
3,Watch Out,"This book is a collection of very short essays that (as a whole) does not even come close to approaching the quality and originality of the first book in the series. Vol. 2 is a decent read, but if you are expecting more of Cosmic Trigger Vol. 1, you will be very disappointed. This book is much more biographical than Vol. 1 and less ""out there"". RAW details growing up in a sheltered neighborhood, living in Ireland, the Mafia connections to the Vatican and the CIA, and many other things. All in all, it was interesting, but after the excellent Vol.1, I was expecting something a little more cosmic in scope."
5,Ignite Your Soul,"Can a book rearrange the polarity of your conscious mind, stimulate dosing neurons into excitation, and spur you into understanding ""reality."" What about put a smile on your face every step of the way.There has never been anyone like Robert Anton Wilson, cosmic jester/philosopher extraordinaire who has generously expanded more minds through the years than most so-called teachers of higher learning. ""Higher Learning"" through the RAW method produces a frightening, staggering number of people who end up thinking for themselves and - this part's really scary - actually start enjoying their lives.How wonderful."
5,Oh what a fine ride!,This book is awe inspiring to me - I think we have lost a great mind in RAW's passing - I hope we can all keep ours opened a bit more in reading his observations and insights and truths! Read them all!
4,oar ease,"this product is very good colapses and entends with ease is very stong , lite, floats what eslse do you need"
2,So short lived,"This product worked so well....while it worked. It drains batteries quickly which are expensive. Worst of all though, it that it has completely stopped working!! It will beep but will not spray on level 2 or 3. This is so frustrating. Our husky mix was showing such great progress the collar wasn't in operation long enough to make any lasting change. This product is way too expensive to have stopped working after only a few months of use....only had to refil it 3 times!!! I am very disappointed and due to poor quality would not recommend it."
1,not as pictured,"This model has been discontinued apparently, and a different product was sent. They do the same thing and the other appears okay, except that the on/off switch requires a coin to operate. I hope that this is to make the unit more water proof, but don't know. But my previous remote and parts don't work on this. Product may be better than one star, but I want to alert you that it is not as pictured."
4,Beauty is only skin deep,"At the end of the Civil War, a religious cult of beautiful people is terrorizing a town. They're taking the souls' of individuals so that they will become part of their dark cult. A town rallies together to fight off this evil cult. After slaughtering them all they buried their bodies in a massive grave. A sycamore tree was planted over the grave, and a little girl gave the warning that if the tree were to ever be removed, the evil cult would rise again. 100 years later, the tree is bulldozed to make room for a mall parking lot. The cult rises from their grave, and takes their form of beautiful people."
5,Don't know what the other reviewer is thinking,"this book was really good! Well rounded text. Great format (although small print). Nearly 350 pages. I would highly recommend to Women's Studies, Black Studies, Queer Theory, English majors (studying African American lit)."
2,Resistance bands handle sucks.,Forget this kit. The handles are rubber and bend. So your hands will get very irritated unless you wear some really stiff gloves to replace the function of the handles. Everything else is cheap but ok.
4,Has great options and sound quality.,This product works and sounds great. The only negatives I have about this product is that the manual is confusing for the average user and the fact that it only has two HDMI inputs.
3,AVR 2807,"Highly recommened by real audiophiles, however it was very complicated to set up. The manual was difficult to understand. Now that I have it working I'm pleased."
3,"If sound quality is your priority, buy Rotel instead.","My last receiver was a Denon, and I was impressed with it, so I naturally assumed Denon would be my first choice again, given their reputation for excellent receivers.I listened to it and felt something was missing; it didn't quite sound natural. I then tried a Rotel, and the sound quality was truly astounding, the best I've ever heard. I bought the Rotel that same day, despite the fact that it has fewer features and looks a little antique.Do yourself a favor and at least listen to a Rotel before you buy; it makes ordinary CD music sound clearer and more natural than any of the ""mainstream"" brands. Even relatively extreme passages that sound harsh or gritty on other receivers sound normal on a Rotel. If sound is more important to you than features, the Denon is NOT your best choice (nor is Pioneer Elite)."
2,Not a cleanser but rather a lemon moisturizer,I love most of Burt's Bees products but I won't purchase this one again for myself. It is not a cleanser but rather a lemon moisturizer. Heavy oil base. It's lovely in scent but a waxy coat is left on the skin. It would be excellent for someone who lives in a dry climate and does not use any make-up.
3,hmmmm,"The poppy seeds doesn't do much of a scrub, in fact it's so painful when they get in my eyes. I've got quite sensitive skin and the paste does sting a little bit when I use it. I'm not quite sure of this product. Better suited for very dry skin cleanser or to be used in dry regions."
3,Burt's Bees was recently bought by CLOROX.,If your choice of Burt's Bees was influenced (at least in part) by the desire to avoid the health-compromising corporate sphere--as mine was--the news that Clorox now owns Burt's Bees might be important to you.
2,COULD HAVE DONE BETTER!,"AFTER WAITING SO LONG FOR LIONEL RICHIE'S DVD I WAS NOT HAPPY.FIRST'THE LEFT FRONT CHANNEL IN THE 5.1 SURROUND MODE WON'T WORK.THAT'S RIGHT,NO SOUND OUT THE LEFT FRONT SPEAKER!!I GOT ANOTHER ONE....SAME THING!!SECOND,THE PICTURE COULD HAVE BEEN BETTER FOR SUCH A TOP ENTERTAINER.LIKE HD."
1,DON'T EVEN TOUCH THIS DVD,"This is the MOST HORRIBLE DVD in my collection, and YES, like all reviewers kind enough to share, THE LEFT CHANNEL DOESN""T WORK.I was setting up my new Pioneer LX-56 Receiver and after wiring all up, i spent two hours trying to fix my Pioneer. It is unfortunate that i use my most love concert on my new AV System and i was switching wires around like an idiot thinking the my new Marantz and Pioneer is faulty.I have never choose to believe that a DVD will have such a flaw and yet they still sells it.What a crazy thing."
1,i hope Amazon is listening,I really enjoy listening to Lionel Richie and was looking forward to purchasing this DVD. That is until I read the reviews here on Amazon. After doing some checking online I've come to the conclusion that almost everyone who has purchased this has ended up with a defective copy and the producers ignore the fans who contact them. So sadly this is one fine concert that I won't be adding to my collection. My advice is you want to find out for yourself put away your wallet and get it from the library if you still want to hear it.
1,Audio Defect Confirmation,I purchased the cd/dvd with the same audio defect. I've emailed Island Records with no response. I've also posted a review on Lionel Richie's site as well and have not heard anything. Guess I'll return the dvd/cd and wait and see if they do a second pressing.
1,Nicole you better talk to your dad about this...,"Hey Nicole, tell your dad that he really made it this time... my God!!! Terrible sound, only right channel works.Hey Lionel, what is wrong with you my friend?"
1,FiestyTee,"Lionel need singing classes. Maybe if he stop letting the audiance sing the song he can improve his on his voice. Also, sing the song instead of a vers of the song."
2,I got punk'd,Wow I too have the same prob. DO these people not test the DVD before they ship it out.... :-( DVD on the 5.1 Surround Sound more like 3.1Rating is for the Music encoding NOT for LionelThey did send a fix for the DVD - all is well
1,Be Aware: Defective - Live in Paris DVD,I have exchanged 3 different copies on the latest Lionel Richie - Live in Paris CD/DVD. All 3 copies DVD on the 5.1 Surround Sound doesn't have any sound coming out on left channel on the 5.1 Surround Sound. I have contact his record labels and they have e-mail me or contact me back at all. That's how they treat their fans.
2,"great show, no sound out of left speakers!!","Well mine was the same as everyone else's.Is it only the ones from Amazon.com that are this way?Is this how it was intended to have 80% of the sound from the right hand side?I just saw Lionel in concert here in New Zealand and this is a great souvenir of the show, but having the sound problem makes it unenjoyable to watch.But again, great show."
1,Lionel Cheerleading,"If you want to see Lionel romping about the stage cheerleading his audience, listening to him shout lyrics to them and listening to the audience sing his songs, this is for you. If you want to hear Lionel justdoing what he does best--singing--save your money! This DVD stinks."
4,BUY THE BLU RAY,I purchased the DVD also and was very disappointed. It's not even 3.0...more like 1.5. The Blu ray is really 5.0...Buy the Blu ray version and it's a completely acceptable experience for the surround sound perfectionist!
2,Audio Missing Left Channel,Beware the dvd has almost all of the audio missing from the left front and left rear channels on the concert footage. The videos have the audio intact. This is very disappointing and is almost not worth watching. We did not watch the disc until it was too late to return it so it will become an expensive coaster.Lionel Richie should be pissed off and demand that all of those listed here get a new release of the disc with corrected audio. What do you say Lionel??
3,a very enjoyable book,I have just started to read Earl Emerson's books and am pleasantly surprised. They are not loaded down with a lot of details and have interesting plots. I look forward to reading more of his books.
1,Fab? Dreary and Routine...,"This book has the same old ideas you've seen everywhere else. Graphic organizers, writing projects, brochures, etc. You've probably already seen most if not all of the ideas in this book. There are better books available."
4,Unexpected,"If you're looking for a traditional ""Life of the Saints"" sort of thing...don't bother. This is an unconventional look at the concept of female sainthood and the idea that many of these 'saints' were merely women who didn't quite fit in with current social expectations. Roberts weaves updated and cynical tales of real saints with the down to earth story of a fictional St. Josephine. There are a few miracles and each saint is given a distinct, often un-saint like voice. All in all, this was a good read and will certainly give the reader much to think about afterwards."
4,Alpha Band LPs Sittin' In The Ground 50 Million Years Ago...,"Just wanted to add my two cents worth re: sonic remastering of this set. First, the albums were well recorded to begin with. Second, the CD claims an actual remastering job by a real engineer, Third, there was no hiss/scratch/crackle/pop when I played my copy on my car CD player and on my DVD/CD home theater. In fact, I quite enjoyed the clarity and depth of the remastering job. Lastly, like everyone else wrote, these were grossly neglected albums when they were released and very few vinyl copies made it out of the era unscathed. I'm thankful to Acadia (a reputable UK reissue firm founded by people who worked at Demon/Edsel in the 1990s) for realising that all three LPs needed a CD reissue and this format is a superb way to get all three at a decent price. Buy without fear..."
4,Eye opening,This is a great book to introduce us all to our own money. It explained things in a easy to grasp way. I enjoyed reading it.
4,useful beliefs,"This book is interesting. Its greatest value is the new beliefs about money, such as the title. The value comes from installing these methods. The bookGamma Healing. Eliminate subconscious limiting beliefs, anxiety fear and doubt in less than 5 minutes.is an example of one way to install belief systems, though there are many others."
2,Too many ideas for such a small book,"Money making process is a very wide area. Author tried to mention all the ingredients that make a successfull money making formula. In doing so the book is more a list of things, then practical ideas how to accomplish them. Also I do not like how he goes very deep into psychology. Rich Dad's series are much better if you need to change your way of thinking about money."
3,Smells bad and NOT RETURNABLE!,"Be warned that Amazon does not allow you to return this product, and it would have been nice if it said that up front. I bought this brand instead of the Castle brand I usually use because it had free shipping, but it smells horrible for some reason. I'm not really understanding the chemical aspects of this stuff, but I'm starting to think the different manufacturers that claim ""pure silicone"" are using their terminology loosely. The Castle brand says ""pure silicone"" and on the can it says 99.1% pure silicone. This KEL brand doesn't say anywhere on the can what percent is pure silicone, but the ingredient list is different than the Castle brand. It has propane listed as the first ingredient where the Castle brand has propane as the second ingredient. Not sure if that's the reason for the smell or not, and I'm not sure if that means it has less silicone in it or not."
3,OK,I gave this book 3 stars because I like Constance O'Banyon.This book wasnt a bad book it was just boring. I could not get into the story at all.
3,Conversion adapter for A85,It worked well but I am not sure what its function is. It seems to me that the camera could have been designed so that the zoom lens could fit without having to attach an adapter. The problem is that you have to remove the existing cowling from the camera and hope you do not loose it (which I almost did).
3,Canon Adapter,"The product is OK. But since you are buying the product for camera lens, don't waste your money. The lens for the Canon PowerShot A are unreliable."
2,"Great artist, but really bad copies of his work","After seeing the Cult of Beauty exhibit in San Francisco, which featured some of the works shown in this book, I was shocked to see how poor the reproductions are in this book. The images are all very flat, and some of them don't even show the colors right. For example, in Flaming June, the blue in the sky is totally lost. Some quality loss can be blamed on the limitations of the printing process itself. However, we purchased the catalog for the exhibit, and many of the same prints are shown in that catalog with much better results.Buy the book if you want to learn about his life and get a general idea of his work. But if you really like his work you'll be disappointed by this book."
3,Misled by publisher,"This book is simply a reprint of Collage Art by Jennifer Atkinson and Collage For The Soul by Holly Harrison. Not a bad combination, but definitely a rip-off for those of us who already own both books.I have an arts and crafts store and have had to put my copies of Collage Art on sale, because it's pointless carrying that book when, for the same price, they can get Collage Sourcebook. I was not informed by the publisher, when I ordered both together, and am very disappointed in them.The book itself, is very good and, if you don't have the other two, Collage Sourcebook offers a less expensive way of owning them both. I do recomment purchase."
1,Might be a big waste of your money.,"What a rip-off! As others have said, this book is nothing but a compilation of 2 other books. Do the ""Look Inside"" trick and on the inside first page it credits the two books. This information SHOULD be fully disclosed in the Amazon description, as not everyone to reads all the reviews. Only by chance did I see this book at my local B&N, checked it out and discovered the hoax. Otherwise I might have ordered it and been really mad because I have the other 2 books. The book ""Making Memory Books and Journals by Hand"" is the same type of rip-off and again, I think Amazon should include this data up-front, in the description."
4,A helpful overview with GREAT pictures,"I was disheartened when I read another reader's review of this book. Since I don't own any of the books the other reviewer mentioned, I don't know if material has been copied - I CAN say that the photos and brief ""how to-s"" in this volume were inspiring! There are lots of techniques to explore, and yes, if you want to try and reproduce the EXACT works, you could - but for me, and I suspect for many other artists looking into modern collage ideas, this book provides a number of starting points for further exploration. The works are well photographed and labelled, with artist details included in the text, and overall this book is well produced and presented.If you're interested in exploring collage, this is a great kick off."
5,excellent book for methods and meaningful projects,I was surprised when I received this book because I was expecting more a technical listing of supplies and methods. It has that and more. The suggested projects and beautiful examples are an inspiration for me and for my classes.
1,Cheated,"This book is a reprint of a previous book by the author, although it was not advertised that way. Don't waste your money. The book was not great the first time around and this is just robbery!"
1,Audiofy Audiobook Pimsleur Swedish,"I have purchased Pimsleur French on CD in the past, and the sound quality was excellent. The Swedish follows the same format, but the sound quality on the bookchip is extremely poor. It sounds as if the speakers are at the bottom of a well, and is like trying to learn a language when you have a hearing impairment. I don't know whether other Audiobooks have this problem, but it is very disappointing, given they are such a convenient format. And I don't know whether the Swedish on CDs have better sound quality, but it makes me wary of buying bookchips for languages in the future."
4,recorder,"I sing in the choir at church, needed this for rehearsal great price and work realy well, no static and sound clearly"
1,Sony TCM150 Cassette Recorder,"Not pleased with this product due to it being monoaural and not stereo!! Can't believe that in 2012, this product would not be stereo!!"
2,Noisy,"I haven't used it a lot, but it sure picks up a lot of background noise. Maybe that's because I was trying to use it outside, perhaps it would work better indoors."
1,Piece of Junk,"I rarely ever give products a bad rating but I have to tell you, this thing is a piece of JUNK! It stopped playing in less than a week. $19.99 down the drain. I saw good reviews, and bad reviews and I gave it the benefit of the doubt. I would not recommend this product."
1,sony recorder,I always thought Sony made quality products. this voice recorder is junk it makes so much static you can hardly hear what you have recorded. don't buy this item.
3,Pay a little bit more for important features,"The Sony TCM-150 is about the cheapest cassette recorder on the market at this time. For five to ten bucks more you get voice activation, an external microphone jack, a tape counter, and extended play/record. The models with these features are the Sony TCM-200DV (without the tape counter) and the Panasonic RQ-L31. Of course, in all these cases, you're getting a cheaply made recorder intended for lectures, notes and inteviews. If you want something for music or that's built to take some punishment you'll have to pay more.Last word on the 150: The odds are you're going to need at least one of those extra features - especially voice activation. Pass on this one and pay just a tiny bit more for something better."
1,Works well but................,I am quite disappointed with this sony product. It works well but the big drawback is that you hear the motor rumble in your recordings. I wonder if other buyers have this problem or did I get a poor model? Buy cheap and get cheap I should know better.
4,Cassette Recorder - very portable,"I travel an hour each way to work and listen to non-musical tapes in my car during the drive. This little cassette recorder is perfect for my uses as it is small enough to stick in the various storage compartments in my car and loud enough to hear as I drive. I previously bought the exact same model a year ago and it ""died"". I do use it quite a bit, though. The only thing I don't like about the TCM-150 is the fact it doesn't turn itself off when the tape side is done. You have to push the ""stop"" button or it keeps on running and wears the battery down. The sound is fine."
3,Nice.but stop working after about 6 months,"Good quality recording,however only worked for about 6 months and had to return for service.Awaiting info on replacement."
2,It didn't last.,Sony Tape PlayerI bought the cheap Sony 150 and I got what I paid for.I didn't need the recording I just want something to play my tapes.Well it burn out about six month into my use.
4,Good for the price,"Great little recorder for the price, better build quality than the RCA shoebox I owned before.For those who care, two things you won't find in the product description or manual.1) FF/RW don't stop at end of the tape, so it's not ""FULL AUTO STOP""2) The erase head is a simple magnet; recording is DC bias"
3,Sony,"Sony as a brand is usually over rated. Recorder works fine for $20 but you get what you pay for. If you plan on using this for anything important, forget about it. Spend the money and buy something nice. Need something for the kids to mess around with? This is it."
4,This Does The Job,"The recorder has a good sound and pick up very well. If you are in achoir or just want to record, this is a good buy at it's cost. I ampleased with my purchase."
4,Volume Not Great for Music,I mainly bought this recorder to record music for my 5 year old great grandson. He loves music but because of his age I needed something simple for him to use. This recorder is very simple and he and his 3 year old sister can both use it with no problem. The main problem I found with it is that with music you have to turn the volume down low or it is too distorted to really enjoy--that is if you turn the volume up. He and his sister both love this recorder so I gave it 4 stars for that and only took away the one star because of having to turn the volume down to enjoy music.
5,Sony recorder,"Great high-quality for it's small, handy size. Just what I needed, and was glad to find it at a reasonable price!"
4,My Tape Recorder,I like this recorder for taping my practices at choir rehersals. It's small enough that I can hold it along with my music folder. I feel the quality of sound is good for my purposes.
4,Great Church Choir Accessory,"I am on my second one of these machines. I use it extensively and rigorously. It's great for recording church choir rehearsals to assist me in learning my part and also to listen to the practices for entertainment, as well. The recorder picks up all the ""studio chatter"" of the rehearsals and also has fairly good fidelity for such a basic, analog system. I have been quite pleased with this tape machine."
4,hard to find old style recorders,I was glad to easily find this item on Amazon and the delivery was very prompt.
4,Sony Casette Recorder Review,"This unit is perfect for the purpose I wanted it for. It's difficult to find these at all, let alone at a reasonable price. There are not a lot of ""bells & whistles""; it's great as a basic unit for voice recordings sitting in a classroom. The sound is good and it is very easy to operate. I would recommend this player/recorder to anyone looking for an inexpensive portable unit."
5,Just What I Needed,"A few months ago my old hand-held cassette tape recorder stopped functioning. It was beyond repair, so I needed to get a new one. After some searching, I chose this cassette recorder from Sony. I've had it for over a month and it works fine. I particularly like how the ""record"" button is colored bright red and it isn't right next to the play button so you should never make the mistake of accidentally hitting record when you really wanted to hit play (something that happened every now and again with my old recorder). It's been years since I bought my old recorder, so I was quite surprised to find that the average hand held cassette recorder is now selling for about $40. This device sells for less than that. I've been quite satisfied with the Sony TCM-150 and recommend it. As a side note, the label for this device says it comes in a carton of three--that is a mistake. You only get one, but the seller has them in cartons of three."
4,Great Basic Player/Recorder,"I primarily bought the TCM-150 to play back audio tapes. Some of the earlier comments mentioned its frequency range. Remember that this is a portable tape player. Besides, if you're interested in fidelity, you should look at something else. For my part, I was personally happy with the rock tape I played. I was especially pleased with the built-in speaker. It's larger than I expected for a player of this size. Consequently, I can easily listen to audio without having to use earphones. Finally, I didn't see any problems with the player's quality."
5,Sony Cassete Voice Recorder,This little recorder is great for recording and playing back speeches for editing purposes. It is also great for listening to tapes while doing other things -- the biggest advantage is that one does not need to use headphones with this Sony.
4,Nice inexpensive cassette player,"This works great and the audio quality is good for the books on tape I listen to with it. I wish it had a belt clip on it, though."
3,Old Version,"I was unaware when I purchased this that the brains at Suzuki, wherever they may be, have changed the bowing on the second book in many of the songs. Our teacher now has to write in corrections because this is an outdated publication. Just an FYI, get the newer one to prevent bowing headaches! (Everything is the same in the books, except the bowing.)"
2,Suzuki Violin e-book,Very dissappointed in this purchase; it did not contain the illustrations found in the book. I purchased this for my kindle thinking that it would be easier to bring with me to class. It was not very practical because it was difficult to read the sheet music.
4,Good,"This is a good product. I just didn't realize it was a revised edition until I received it, but it still works!"
5,Received Quickly in Very Good Condition,I received this music book in execellent condition in record speed. The book has what I needed in it.I would recommend this merchant and product.
4,Starting with the violin,This is a fine series to begin the aquisition of the ability to play the violin
1,Suzuki Violin Book & CD,This is my second review of this product. The top pages of this book were sealed together and I had to separate them with a knife. Also the CD did not work - it skipped every ten seconds of so.
3,BEWARE - It may be in stock but may not be shipped out until MORE THAN A WEEK LATER!,"I ordered this book back in April 30 the impression from the website that was in stock and hence could be shipped out immediately. However, I wasn't given notice that it was shipped until MAY 8 and they have not yet arrived by MAY 11! Who knows about the book itself, since i have not yet received it, butI am NOT satisfied with this order. BEWARE - consider ordering from another music or book website.Suzinne"
1,Kindle Edition,"Haven't even been 40 pages into this thing and am already frustrated that this ebook was not set up for localization. I don't know if this is a feature of the Kindle ebook format, but it should be. There are so many pages of non-English I must skim through to get to the next meaningful topic its absurd. Secondly, I can't see the images clearly for the pieces of the violin even when zooming in."
5,Outstanding,The combination of the book and CD are excellent. Very easy to use and learn. I would't recommend any other method. This is a pediatric proven method that really works.
2,"Ok, but not great","I am a piano player, and have given some lessons. I am starting violin with my kids this week. I was expecting this to be more of a method book, I guess. This just has very few instructions with it, and then starts in with the songs. Since violin music has some special notations with with I am not familiar, I can't just sit down and teach myself the violin. A better explanation and better set of photos of the hand positions would have been nice, too. If you have a teacher, then this may not be bad for you or your kids. If you are hoping to teach yourself, this is not the best book to get."
2,does not come with CD,"Please note......This book does not come with the CD in case you were wondering as I was. If you want to purchase with CD, find another option."
3,Not for Teaching Yourself,"I bought this book to help me teach myself violin, but this book fell short in that aspect. It is written assuming you are being taught by a teacher and is basically just a supplementary music book. It does not contain enough direction needed to learn on your own."
5,Right method for my daughter.,Making great strides now that she's on Suzuki. Bravo!I made the mistake of buying without the CD when the teacher required the CD. Better value in combination..
4,A good way to start,"This is the first book for a beginner of any age. Students in this method can start as soon as they have any interest in music, as young as 3 years old. The idea is to listen to the audio CD and learn the tone and rythym of notes rather than the technical approach to learning music theory. the student practices a sequence of simple songs designed to teach techique gradually. You can't really learn violin on your own with the book. You need an instructor. It is a good approach and very popular."
4,Not exactly what I expected,"I thought this was going to be a spiral bounded soft cover. Turns out it is a soft cover, not spiral bounded. Other than its fine."
1,Don't Like This Watch,"Too hard to set up and almost impossible to read the digital dial, especially in bright or low light situations. Took me weeks to finally get the day/date function correct and I just gave up on the stopwatch/timer functions. Fine for kids who are into this kind of stuff, but for adults there are better watches."
5,works great,My son had been so disapppointed not being able to use his 4x4 remote truck because the remote charger died and a new rechargeable battery at a battery store was going to be 50$.We got this one for half the price and works great. I now have a very happy boy with his remote truck working again.
5,great Christian reader,"My son is working his way through this series and he is learning so much. Not only is he getting practice reading, but he's learning Bible stories as well."
2,Not Good,"I read this book for school. Maybe I'm biased because I am not a fan of the Fantasy genre (Harry Potter aside). But this was just not good. The chess game was an intriguing idea, and would have made for a good story. But parts of it were laughable when they weren't supposed to be. The beginning was the usual cliche thing with a girl who wants to be popular, blah blah. The ending was the worst part, abrupt and weird. It took me a week to finish because I kept putting it down and I didn't want to pick it back up. The characters seem feelingless and boring. Not good."
5,Simply fabulous!,"Entertaining and informative, this author knows what she's talking about. The book is a quick read and I often laughed out loud. Chapters cover topics from choosing the right bird to talking to egg laying. But my favorite was the last, which answers questions such as ""I set a special place at the table for my bird, but he always wants to eat off my plate."" Filled with stories involving a wide range of birds from parakeets to cockatoos to finches. Highly recommended!"
4,Very Intertaining and a pleasure to read.,"Although I considered this book ""Very Intertaining and a pleasure to read."" (It has some excellent stories,) I also considered it as border line NASTY in the way the author addressed matters such as the birds sexual tendoncies and bathroom useage. Other than these matters I found myself wishing the book would never end. I would suggest the author consider writting a book on Bird stories. Suggested title, ""Bird Lovers True Stories."" She has a good story telling ability, and I am sure, the experience to put out a best seller. I would recommend this book..."
2,Not really good for plus women,Nice stretchy material but too short and I'm usually a 16-18. The G-string is not even close to plus size...don't even bother.
1,Not made for a plus size,"Why do some companies seem to think that simply adding more fabric will make something fit a bigger woman? It was too short, didn't flare out at all in the skirt, and the halter part was so long that it sagged, and so thin that my chest fell out the sides. I specifically looked at the models shown to make sure my chest would fit into it, and the model in white showed that it would, but it didn't. I suggest buying this only if you are flat-chested and want something cut to the navel in front which exposes your rear. I almost believe this was designed for the sole purpose of making heavy women cry into the mirror. It is possible to make flattering plus-size lingerie, but I don't think this company knows how."
4,"Great item, but plan ahead",The item looks great on the wife. Very nice.Plan ahead if you order from Angelique...It will take a long time to arrive with standard shipping.
4,Beautiful & Functional Lamp,"This is a terrific lamp. Attractive, modern, functional and with an elegantly simple touch control. The brushed steel look is particulaly beautiful. It makes an excellent table lamp and is especially good as a bed-side lamp. The frosted glass shade diffuses light very well. My one mild complaint, and it is not a unique one, is that the assembly directions need to be clearer with explicit directions as to the type of light bulbs that can, and cannot, be used in the lamp. Regardless, it is an excellent lamp and I definitely would buy another one."
3,So little action!,"I've been following this series since they came out and out of the four books already out this one was the slowest one when it came to action and fights. The way the main characters relationship has been played was well done, but the book overall left me wanting for something that wasn't there...maybe next one."
3,Surrogate Evil,"I absolutely love the Lee Nez series. Even though he is half vampire, they make it believable and the books where they are dealing with other vampires and skinwalker shapeshifters were great. The last book without them, was not as interesting or fast reading, but I still liked it. I just hope that they write more Lee Nez and that they incorporate the supernatural aspects again. That is what really make them interesting. Love the authors and also their Ella Clah series."
3,"Okay, but may not be the best solution","I suppose there just aren't many good ways to transport a puzzle in progress, but it seems like there might be better ways than this. It does the job, and if you're careful enough in the rolling process, it does maintain your progress fairly well. The problem, however, is that the work surface is simply a sheet of vinyl with a velvety coating. The coating succeeds in keeping the pieces from sliding around, but it's an absolute magnet for the dust left in the box from cutting the puzzle, not to mention hair and other debris. The even worse problem, though, is that it's pretty much impossible to get the wrinkles out of the vinyl surface, even on a hard surface. That can be very frustrating in the early stages of working a puzzle. This item does the job, but it seems like a very thick sheet of felt might work better."
4,This Puzzle mat works!!,"This puzzle mat is really helpful if you would like to put away your puzzle or move your puzzle somewhere. This puzzle mat works for big puzzles, I have been working on a 1000piece puzzle and it holds, as long as you roll it up tightly no pieces will fall out of place. Overall, this puzzle mat works pretty well, the inside is like felt so not to much stuff sticks to it. Overall, this mat works well, and is not that expensive! Thanks Amazon!!"
3,Slightly Disappointed,"My family enjoys doing a difficult puzzle together during the holidays, but it became a problem when the puzzle couldn't be transported easily and had to be partially disassembled to be relocated. I purchased the puzzle carrier to make the transportation process easier and less frustrating. However, it brought about new frustrations with the plethora of lint that sticks to the work surface and the wrinkles that make it very difficult for the smaller pieces to stay together. It was very nice to be able to move the puzzle from location to location without disassembling it, but it became very frustrating to try to keep the pieces together with the large wrinkles running through the vinyl backing. I assume that by storing it out of the box and rolled around the cylinder that the wrinkles would eventually be less prominent, but I have yet to experience that phenomenon."
2,Too complicated and not tight enough,This did not wrap tight enough around the puzzle pieces and they all fell out. The end was too loose and they kept slipping through there. All our hours of hard work got undone when this got slightly knocked to the side.
2,not so hot,"I bought this product hoping to indulge my puzzle hobby despite two small children who get into everything. I'm disappointed. First of all, when the carrier is inflated and rolled, it's quite large, and I'm at a loss for a place to stash it that's out of children's reach. The first time I used it, I rolled the carrier with the puzzle's edges complete, and when I unrolled it, many of the pieces had broken apart, and some had fallen out of the carrier. Also, since the velvet fabric has creases from it's initial packaging, it provides a less than smooth surface, which is difficult to work on. The best I can say is that the product is not very expensive, but it's not at all what I hoped."
3,Works as Described,I don't think a perfect system exists for transporting big puzzles but this comes close. Yes the wrinkles make it difficult and annoying but the most important thing for me is that I don't have to worry about missing pieces. I have a 9 month old so I can only work on the puzzle during nap times or bedtimes anyways but I was able to roll up what I'd completed before he was able to get to it which was a plus!!
4,jigsaw puzzle roll,"Inflatable roll makes for a clever design, easy to store and transport, plastic backing a bit lumpy under the puzzle."
2,Irregular surface,"I bought this item because I love puzzles and I thought it would be nice to roll the puzzle while I'm still assembling it. To my surprise, the surface is very uneven and I cuoldn't assemble a loose puzzle because it kept falling apart. The little I did assemble fell apart when I rolled it. This, after having spent a long time blowing to inflate it! not useful!!"
1,Don't waste your money on this,"Unless you are extremely careful in rolling this up, it won't work. I must say it is extremely hard to roll it up completely shut tight, puzzle pieces fall of from the side once it's rolled up, and when you unroll it some of the pieces my fall off too soon. I recommend you go for the more expensive, yet more convenient options."
3,it's ok,"pretty basic,I read the whole thing in a half hour, maybe 40 minutes.ok for someone who knows nothing, or very little, about him. There is some interesting information in there, more so on the history of medical advancement, of which hippocrates was incredibly influential. Not bad if you want a quick read and are interested in the history of western medicine."
5,I used to do this for a living!,"I read Mr. Jones's book with great interest. I started in the IT field working as an Internet Abuse Investigator for UUnet. I thought ""I'll probably not learn anything new..."" Boy I was wrong. The book was filled with helpful hints as well as ready to use Perl code. I'd highly recommend this book to anyone interested in tracking scammers down."
1,Amazingly bad,"This book should be titled, Internet Security for Complete Idiots. If you think it's a good book, it's because you don't know much about Internet security. If you're a security professional and you think it's a good book, find a new career."
1,"Far, far below O'Reilly's standards","This book is written at a very low level. It is best suited to individuals with a very low experiance level; NOT for security professionals. O'Reilly has a number of good security books, but this is not one of them. Don't waste your money on it."
1,Don't Buy Sony SLV-N900,"I've had numerous VCRs in my life. Some were good and some were better. This is the worst one. The problem is the self lock mechanism which renders the VCR virtually dead (no power and no possibility to turn it on). There is a way to bypass this problem (which first occurred when we just bought the machine) and were let in on the ""secret"" by customer support. However, less then ten months after I bought the Sony SLV-N900, the same thing happened, only this time I was not able to unlock it. I was told by customer service that I need to send it to them, and they will repair it for $63.13 because the warranty covers the parts, but not the work!!! - BEWARE"
2,Oh! For the good old days,"Oh! for the days when one could buy a GOOD VCR.Transport (tape motion mechanism) is lousy, lacks features. The ""Scan and Play"" concept is consumately stupid. Very frustrating to use.But if you have hundreds of VHS tapes and all your good VCRs finally died of old age, it's better than nothing.A little bit."
4,Ry DOGG is right on,This fits all previous reveiws including ry dogg. It's has nice feutures replays very well. Records like the singnal is from an Alien Planet during a ionic storm. Why sony didn't take the recording aspect as seriously as the rest of thier system is maybe they want to encourage DVR sales.All in All; Sony makes incredible products but they blinked on that recording project.
1,I Appreciate Sony Products,"I am sorry to say, but I returned this product. I was unable to use it. I bought a Panasonic in its place."
2,"Little use, quick death.","The SLV-N900 is a good deal at first view but it's durability is not there. Plastic parts fail, eats tapes. If you don't watch tapes and want just a TV tuner it's ok."
2,Don't look for warranty service,"I purchased this VCR in December, 2006. Since then, there has been an intermittant problem with the timer record function. I never know if a show I set it to record will actually be recorded. When I contacted Sony regarding warranty repair, they informed me that I had to send it to Laredo, TX on my dime, and it would cost $29.95 to get it repaired under warranty! Or actually not repaired, but exchanged for a refurbished unit. BUT, they informed me that there were no SLV-N900 models available for the exchange, and they would contact me AFTER I SENT THE UNIT IN to discuss ""alternative models available""."
1,Just Awful!,"A sad mistake to order, I expected it to be cake bites, or something similar, even little nuggets. Instead they are like large pills, and they were the worst tasting things I've eaten in a very long time! They were bitter and hard, and tasted worse than any vitamin pill I've every eaten! I can't believe this got past taste-testers."
5,Great fire pit!,"I just bought this item and had some friends over the other night. It was chilly outside and so we started a fire. This thing works great! I like it because it is deep and it holds pretty large pieces of wood. It looks nice, and seems to be well-made, although the ring on the outside was a little off.I will probably use this a lot, and I hope it lasts a long time. The poker that came with it is strong and very handy!"
4,fantastic,"My husband loves this. It was supposed to come after christmas, but was delivered before. He saw it, but he really enjoys it."
5,I love fire,"I've made fires in the on weekends for several weeks and it works great. My small children have mostly been unscathed, despite hot fire and metal, because the ring around the outside makes it much harder to touch the hot bowl. The grating on top cools relatively quickly when taken off, e.g. to grill food. Some reviewers thought the grill was too high up for cooking; I have not had this problem.Overall, it does exactly what I thought it would, and it looks beautiful with the animal cutouts.Also, for people who love fire or burning things, this is a relatively inexpensive way to buy happiness. I've had several rough days which got amazingly better once I lit up some wood. Sitting in front of an outdoor fire is very relaxing."
4,So far so good!!,"Our fire pit just arrived! My husband and I put it together in about 15 min. It was not that difficult. It looks great, the wildlife cutouts are well done and the overall size is good, and deep. The outer ring doesn't quite fit together perfectly, but it is sturdy. We haven't used it yet, as the weather has been in the 90's, but we look forward to using it whe the weather cools down."
4,"good price, value",I purchased this firepit from Amazon because they were much cheaper than where I live. In addition the model we were interested in was not available here. Set up and assembly were ok; because of one of the reviews I was expecting some difficulty but it went together in less than 15 minutes. We have used it three times so far and are pleasantly surprised at how well it burns. Because of the cut-outs there is plenty of draught for the flames. We bought this for cool autumn nights and another grandchild magnet; it's great for smores. I'll update this review after the pit has survived a winter.
3,You get what you pay for,"I'm giving it 3 stars because that's what it would rate at its very best (using a sort of hotel rating system). I'm not deducting anything. I bought this (after researching for far too long), and found that it was the best in terms of price vs quality vs bowl size. It has been used once. I took it to an outdoor party and didn't pay attention as people were shoving tree-sized logs into it. It pretty much stood up to the hours of abuse it took - it burned from 9pm to 4am. The screen is very easily dented and the screws that hold the outer ring in place fell out... so I need to find new ones that fit. I think it's worth what I paid (about $105.00 total). I did buy the recommended cover in addition to that. It fits. It hasn't been weather tested yet."
5,Love it!,"This firepit is so cute and gets lots of compliments! I have only used it a few times so far, but I can say that it does what it's supposed to do and has not had any paint melting issues or anything that I have heard of other firepits doing. I did layer the bottom with sand to help it last longer though!"
4,Fire pit,Haven't used it yet but I think it will be perfect in terms of the size (depth and height). I didn't buy the cover so I'm afraid water will collect in the bottom and I'll have a small swimming pool. Otherwise good value.
5,Great value,"Received this as a gift for Christmas. Easy to put together, my 12 yr old did it. Looks great. We have only had one fire in it so far, but love how deep this fire pit is. We used the grill grate and made hamburgers. Worked really well."
4,Good quality & nice to look at,Received fire pit as a Christmas gift and it was a hit! Well made and design is pleasing to the eye. Can't wait to roast some marshmallows.
1,"This keyboard is substandard, and overpriced.","Letters and characters are large, as promised: easy to read, but letters are applied as decals, presumably to a cheap keyboard. Letters can be rubbed off---wonder how long they will last? Key touch is ""cheap,"" very noisy, long-travel: not a good choice for a touch typist. Attached cable too short to reach my under-desk CPU: required the addition of a 24"" extension cable. With vision impairment would recommend a well-lighted standard keyboard at 1/3 the price, or apply your own decals (available elsewhere)."
3,Into the House of the Ancestors is fascinating!,"Experience the vibrant & volatile life of Africa in it's struggle for a ""second revolution"". As someone with protesting for when Nelson Mandela was originally incarcerated under her belt, I was absorbed by this penetrating narrative based on interviews with traditional healers, chiefs, business innovators, scientists, generals, doctors, poets & politics. The stories, observations & interviews Karl Maier brings us are woven into a vibrant fabric as fascinating & devastating as any you'd expect while talking to one of the child soldiers."
4,"Moving, instructive...worthwhile.","Especially recommended for those with minimal knowledge of Africa, as I was/am. The author seems to know and care about Africa as much as any Westerner could. The book draws heavily on interviews with a range of people to illuminate current conditions in the continent. Also, plenty of historical context is provided, and much of it is pretty ugly where Europeans are concerned. Much light is cast on recent and ongoing civil wars, and struggles against AIDS, poverty, cultural erosion, and so forth. One reservation is that the author, in my view overplays the hope and optimism card; I found this jarred with the scale of the suffering and trouble delineated."
2,Skip this one.,"This is a 70 minute, 10 song borefest. There are better albums out there for you to spend your time, and money on. This sonic wall of sound that these guys supposedly puts out is one of the most uninspiring and lame albums I have ever heard. Imagine the same song over and over, with the only the lyrics changing. This is not worth your money. Skip and buy something better."
3,Readable,The title suggests a classic mystery story. The book instead is a romantic thriller full of melodramatic moments. Characterizations are not always consistent and credible. On the other hand it does provide an unexpected surprise or two.
3,A very different murder,"This is a review of the free Kindle version.This is certainly not your normal murder mystery. Instead, it is very much a period piece of depression, love, lust, murder and impersonation. It's....odd, how some of the characters fit together and end up where they are, but the ending is certainly unusual. There is a rather large clue which doesn't get explained in the end, but this is worth a read for the unusual nature.If nothing, read it to watch the main character evolve."
1,Anti-Semitism is not Progressive,"I find it difficult to comprehend how anti-Semitism is ""progressive."" Ben Dib's cartoons that touch upon Jewish subjects, often use classic anti-Jewish stereotypes: big, ugly noses, dressed in black caftans and bearded. Furthermore, he plays upon anti-Jewish themes, such as Jewish control of the media, of the US government.Ben Dib may think of himself as being a critic of Israel, however his cartoons betray a deep anti-Jewish animus. His cartoons of Jews seem to be influenced more by Der Sturmer, than by anything else."
3,Book has been Re-issued...,"Just in case someone needs an electromagnetic problem solver, I did see that this text has been re-issued under another name:2008+ Solved Problems in ElectromagneticsIt can once again be purchased from the publisher, now with a few additional problems. Just FYI: Amazon has them in stock."
2,o.k.,"this was about as good as the first one. I kept waiting and waiting for someone to die, and then when they did die it wasn't even that cool... The plot was sortta lame to and i am a true fan of Mr. Stine, I've read all of his work, and this is not one that i wil willingly read again!"
3,IT WAS OKAY,"THIS BOOK WAS OKAY. I'M REALLY SURPRISED WHO DIED IN IT THOUGH. WHY IS R.L. STINE KILLING OFF SOME OF MY FAVORITE SENIORS? OH WELL. I HAVE ALL THE SENIORS BOOKS EXCEPT FOR GRADUATION DAY. THIS BOOK WASN'T ONE OF THE BEST SENIORS BOOKS, BUT IT WAS STILL OKAY."
4,"stimulating, thought provoking.Great for trainee therapists.",There's much to be found in this book .Many sugestions are made for further research and many links are made to previous material.Mc Niff's language and stance are typically poetic/tricky.I suspect that art therapy students will find it a very useful introduction to this area with much to ponder on . I'm glad to have it on my bookshelf+ to have it to thumb through from time to time. N.B. I havn't read ( every word) cover to cover - but then I don't do that .
2,$50 is overpriced,"I was given the Sony ICF-112 clock radio. I thought the BEEP-BEEP alarm was too quiet to wake me. I'm donating it since setting the time is such a hastle. I went online to get a MSRP price for it... $50.00! Please! It has one speaker, only one alarm setting, no volume control on the buzzer and is not all that compact! Outside of Amazon, I found this alarm for $15.00 - I am still trying to figure why anyone would be happy with this alarm clock for $49.95."
5,No 1 Reference for any Architectural Office,"I've been using Revit since release 4. I'm on release 8 now.The help menu within the software itself is detailed and user friendly, but it does not address issues specific to architectural offices i.e. implementing new software into an established practice.The book 'Introducing & Implementing Autodesk Revit Building' more than adequately addresses every conceivable issue regarding implementation and when used in conjunction with Autodesk Revit's built in help menu should be the only references you'll need to take you from concept to completion on just about any sized architectural project.It's a sound investment for the novice or more advanced Revit user."
5,great resource book,"this book helped me on the first day it arrived. i needed help on how to ""model"" a curtain wall. there it was. the steps that the book went into detail were very good. i keep this book at my desk at work!"
2,Very Basic,This book didn't really help me a whole lot because it's a little too basic in terms of teaching you how to figure out the program. But it does do a good job of explaining the very basic features and benefits of using Autodesk Revit
1,Big Fat Liar,"If you have seen the recent interview of Jessica Lynch by Diane Sawyer....you will realize that Mohammed is a downright LIAR and has fabricated his story to make himself out to be a hero. Jessica Lynch stated that NONE of what he said is true. He not only came out with this book and printed his lies for everyone to see, but a television movie will also be coming out. I respected Jessica's honesty of her account of what actually happened......I despise a LIAR like Mohammed who is just out to make a buck. Don't buy this book!!!!!!!!Bye the way, I only put one star, because it would not print my review if I selected my original rating as a big fat 0!"
4,Engaging read,So many reviews seem to center around whether the events were true or not or with they agree with Lynch's account. (Their paths only cross for a matter of minutes in the book so I don't know how much there is to dispute. Only a 3rd party witness could confirm.) I can say about the book that...- It was hard to put down.- It was more about the author's life than her rescue. I enjoyed this intimate look at an Iraqi's family life as much as the rescue.- It seemed at times too fantastic to be true but that may be simply because my everyday life is a cozy one in America compared to the author's in Iraq.- Some of the atrocities are hard to read about. I don't think this would be appropriate reading for young children.
1,Save your money . . .,"This is about a page and a half of plain old news article. There is nothing new or different that isn't available with more information at no cost on line. What you do get is error: for example, she asserts that co-infection with babesiosis and B burgdorferi or B microti may make for more severe illness, but there is no increased risk for long term complications. This runs counter to the body of literature on this subject. As for other co-infections or tick-borne diseases than babesiosis, her only mention is of A. phagocytophilia, giving the impression that these are the sum of major infections. She completely ignores both erlichiosis and Bartonella, both common co-infections. This author needs to either learn Lyme, or stick to material she has adequately researched."
4,Uncut Dvd Please!!!,"This film has long been a favorite for me, even without the 15 minutes an earlier reviewer described. There is no excuse for a beautifully filmed movie such as this not to be available on dvd in its entirety."
4,"Greed, Power, and Sex in the Automotive Industry.","An intriguing novel set in the automotive world. The story revolves around a dying auto baron and his company, and the efforts of his children and others to gain control using any means possible. The author's attention to detail indicates she knows how the industry works, and makes for interesting reading."
5,"Very informative, gives clear view of the early canon",This is an excellent book. The book demonstrates that the majority of the current canon of the New Testament has been standard from the start while at the same time telling about books which were strongly considered and rejected by the early church (as well as why) along with books in the current canon which were questioned by the early church. Great read for anyone who has an interest in early Christianity or any interest at all in the Bible.
3,"not without its funny moments, but bizarre","Without Rocca's sardonic live delivery, his silliness does not come off as well. There are some truly amusing moments in the book, but you need to stick with an extremely silly story, that does maintain interest very well."
1,He must have spent his own money to get this book published,"What trash! I'm glad I didn't buy it and browsed it in a store. In an article where the author was attending a party and obviously drinking too much, he put down Chihuahuas calling them rats and putting down cats too. He was apparently using this event that benefited resuce pets to push his ridiculous book.If you don't like animals, which he doesn't seem to, he should maybe write about drinking. He seems to know that best. I would have given him a no star rating, but you have to give a least one star to leave a review."
1,I'm throwing this book out,"My friend's and I will pass books back and forth to each other to read if they are good. My friend was going to throw this one out instead of passing it along, but since I have a dog, I thought it would be interesting, but it wasn't, so I had the honor of throwing it out myself.Typically, I would donate the book or give it to charity, but I don't think anyone would enjoy it. It's just this author's drivel. It doesn't focus on the president's and their pets at all like the title suggests.I could see where another author could have created a really fun book about presidents and their dogs."
1,Useless for AP Teachers,"Content is too old and/or irrelevant for use in preparing for a current AP Macroeconomics exam. The book contains several topics that are not covered on the current exam, as well as lacking several topics that are. I could go on about the books flaws (cheap spiral binding, old typewriter-type on pages, etc), but the irrelevancy should be a big enough point to warn any AP teachers from spending their resources on this book."
3,avg,"i have the same cd/mp3 player, except it was an order version. it's cheap, and pretty decentpro: cheap, remote controlcon: headphone sucks, don't last very long (my remote lasted for about a year), no anti-skipp (for most of the time it's not a big prob, but still it's nice to have one), the metal finish is really cheesy"
3,mp3 lacks fast forward / rewind (search),"Seems fine, but the killer for us is no ""search"" feature for mp3. We have _books_ on mp3 so it goes back to radio shack tomorrow!"
4,Good for the cost. Does the Job,"This was definatly worth my 80$ (canadian :P)I needed a cd player that could handle my MP3 cds for biking. I was kinda limited for cash so I got this thing. And I must say, it has been working really good for me.I see people complaining about no skip protection, but I've been going through some mountain biking trails and down stairs no problems.It didn't say WMA compatible on the box where I got either, not that it matters to me since I use MP3s. The no song title/folder display would be nice but I don't miss it in the least. I like make my cds with only songs I will listen too, so just leaving it on random works for me.Volume is just fine. The headsets does the trick, but I bought some earbud ones for biking (waterproof ones too).All in all.. Very worth your hard earned cash if you looking for a cheaper mp3 player."
4,Best CD/mp3 player I've used yet.,"Great CD player, for most people it should be fine. Of course the stock headphones that come with it are junk, but who uses those anyways? Buy a pair of Sony MDR-V6s or the like and then you can hear you tunes perform.Pros:In-line remote is handyAwesome battery lifeReproduces sound quite fineNever seems to skip at allCons:One can't seek within mp3 files. (Bad if you do 30 minute language lessons like I do)Just opening the case will cause the CD player to reset and you will loose you last position.Lacks a display for mp3 id3 tags.The cons are my only reasons for giving it a 4 star rating, otherwise it's great and is even better than other CD players I've used."
5,wonderful player,"I m using it in my car and inspite of not so gud handling, its working absolutely fine. Life which I get from battery is gud. I havent replaced the battery till date. So, full marks for that. mp3 playback quality is also very gud and on this rate wonderful item.congrats to panasonic."
1,Unsuitable mp3 player,This player has no alpha-numeric display and it makes it very difficult to know what is on each CD without making a list beforehand. You only see track numbers and album numbers (corresponding to directories and files). The instructions even give you advice on how to label the albums and tracks with three digit numbers to compensate. The packaging was also very misleading because it said it supported Windows Media files and it does not. I am returning this.
5,Great CD player,"I bought this cd player a couple months ago because my sony just wasn't loud enough and I remember the panasonics always sounded good. Now they have D-sound as well and I really like it. It puts out great sound at high volume levels without worry of blowing your headphones. But the one thing I haven't seen mentioned much is the fact that this thing can take a fall. Mine's taken a lot of abuse, including a couple dozen falls on cement and a high speed car wreck. Definately worth buying"
2,Not good for multiple folders,"First backdraw I noticed: It doesn't have any kind of strap to make it comfortable to carry with you. You have to carry it on your hand, which is highly bothersome if you plan to ride your bike or go jogging or... go fetch a glass of water.I also found this player to be pretty unstable, it tends to skip or even stop completely with any sudden movements, although it says there that it has the protection to avoid taht exact same thing from happening. It might be just an isolated case, and I the only one experimenting this...But then there's another backdraw: it doesn't display the song's names. And it is not easy to ""navigate"" in an MP3 cd which contains many folders. You have to go one by one, because it doesn't have the ""next / previous"" folder feature separated from the ""next / previous"" file feature. So you must know the number of the folder and the number of your song and keep presing the same button until you get there.Had I known this, I wouldn't have bought it."
5,amazing cd player great one youl love it!!,"i bought this player last week and its really good. i think even at 50 bucks i would have bought. 1) it looks good,the cover is very stylish and the lcd display is stylish too.2)it plays mp3s which uses less space in a cd-r or cd-rw. 3)the battery life. man its amazing .i didnt believe that it can give up to 85 hours of playback on an mp3 disc. but i have been using the same batteries since i bought it and the battery still has full charge in it (the battery indicator.4) the d sound. man this new tech is fantastic!!. i used to have a sony phsyc cd player. it was a nice one too but this one beats it thouroughly! and the last thing is the remote. the remote is a tiny one and great one too. i only wosh it had a pause button too. if this disc player could play atrac3 and a tuner in it i think no other cd player would beat it !! way to go panasonic"
2,"Nice idea, but poor quality","I bought this for my daughter and was very disappointed when it arrived. It is a nice collection of toys, in theory, with bandages, face mask and other nice ideas. Unfortunately, the quality of the toys is what I would expect from a gumball machine. The toy pincers, etc. do not move and are made of the lowest quality plastic. I am planning to throw away a number of the parts of this toy and then supplement it myself to put together a decent Christmas present. I'd recommend skipping this collection and just buying an ace bandage and a clipboard with a doctor's kit."
3,Bettlej,"This is a nice role playing kit. My 6 year old granddaughter was delighted with the set and dressed up immediatley as a Vet. The kit contained enough items in it to entertain for hours but the quality of some of the contents could be improved for long term use, other than that, I think it was a little pricey."
2,disappointing,"I was surprised when this product arrived looking like something I would have put together myself, in a 'tupperwear' type plastic box (not even the right size for the contents) and the items inside were sort of a 'throw together' hodge podge of things. It fulfilled the descriptions but some of the pieces were actually adult size (plastic gloves and face masks) and even the 'doctors coat' was just a disposable scrub, much too large for the average kid who would be young enough for this kind of play. I am still considering sending it back but my daughter (mother of the gift recipient) is insisting it's fine and her daughter is enjoying it. This may be a start-up/home business, which I applaud, but they need to step up the quality."
2,Al Capone,"Unless you area Gang member from Chicago and grew up in the 1920's. I thin gyou will have a hard time keeping track of the lingo on this book. Does anyone know what a blind-pigger, a blackhander, or a ward heeler is? if you do let me know because i looked and have no idea. The book does give alot of information about Capone. I did like that, but could only understand about half the book.So unless you are a 1920 chicago gangmember I wouldn't waist to much time on this book."
1,Watch Sucks Big Time!,"Ok, right out of the box the watch dies within a day. Called the 1-800 number and was told to mail it in. Months later we finally got the watch back and the damn thing has died again. I will not buy Fossil again."
1,Do not buy if you have a MAC!,"Unfortunately, this drive ships with something called U3... a Windows application that launches whenever you plug the drive into a machine.If you have a mac, it launches a CD-ROM disc image every time you plug the drive into your machine. And the worst part is, you cannot remove this software unless you have a PC. Reformatting the drive does nothing.If you do a Google search for 'removing U3' you'll see many other people that are unhappy with this technology (PC and MAC).So I recommend avoiding this drive."
1,U3 Not Vista Compatible,"I like U3, and I like the password protection it provides, but these are not Vista compatible. Since the SanDisk/U3 engineering team is unwilling or unable to address this problem, I cannot see myself supporting SanDisk through future purchases."
3,Note for Mac users,"Hey Mac users. I don't know about this U3 model, but the Cruzer flash drives I own, I reformatted for Mac (use Disk Utility in your Applications/Utilities folder.) This not only gets rid of the funky Windows files and makes the drive friendlier to Mac filenames, but will likely get rid of the U3 stuff too. My only complaint with my Cruzers after doing this is that there is still an unreadable volume warning that comes up every time I mount the drive on the desktop (it's harmless, you just dismiss the dialog)."
4,"Good product, bad software","I bought this product because I like the retractable drive. I have to say I love it, except for the software. It tends to become annoying (you can remove it) and also makes it load much slower and it is always looking for updates. I only keep some of the software because I like the password function. The product itself is great. I even accidentally washed mine in the washer one time and it still worked with all my files intact. I also liked the cord and used to hang it around my neck, till it got caught between my chest and the edge of a desk and ripped off."
1,I'd give it a minus 10 if I could...,"I bought this thinking it would be neat. But then I ran into the U3 software! UGH!!!! I'm on a Mac and this U3 software CANNOT be removed without access to a Windows XP PC!!! SanDisk is robbing me! They have hijacked 5 megs of MY disk and won't give it back! I'm totally annoyed, I PAID for this and I can't use all of it's storage space. Also, I have to eject TWO disks every time I want to unmount the disk! If you're on a Mac search for a drive that DOESN'T have U3 software.I'd love to start a class action suit against SanDisk. They have to come up with some way of removing this stupid software without a PC. I don't even KNOW anyone with a PC! So, unless I return this drive, I'm stuck with useless U3 software I didn't want in the first place. And, from what I've found on the 'net, most PC users don't want it either!"
1,JunkDrive,"Ok, I can accept that as a Mac user I am in the minority of Americans, but then, that is one reason I like Mac. What I do not like is being forced to use a PC to eliminate a useless program on the Cruzer. It would be extremely easy for SanDisc to enclose a 'removeal tool"" for Macs. They could even put one on their website.I will never again by a SanDisk product. I recommend that Mac users buy something else, anything else, than put up with this type of disrespect."
1,I hate this drive,"I wish I had read the reviews before buying this piece of junk. As another reviewer says, U3 ruins it. I have a Mac so that feature is useless, but even worse it cannot be disabled. Everytime I plug in the drive I get this cheesy CD image cluttering up my desktop and I have to eject it, along with the drive icon, before the unit can be removed. What clunky engineering. I'll be returning this and scratching Sandisk off my list of reliable companies. I also agree with the reviewer who complained about the packaging. It is impossible to open without tearing it apart, which is probably a strategy to reduce returns."
2,Does not hold as many pictures as advertised!,"Unlike many, I don't have any problems with the software (I use a PC - not MAC and Windows XP - not Vista). My problem is that I was told 1 GB could hold over 1,000 pics and after about 300 pics my SanDisk was full. Buy atleast a 2GB (or even 4 GB) if you want to save lots of photos!"
1,avoid,"Contains READ ONLY ""U3"" portion with trojans, malware, spyware, adware, subscription based services. You cannot use or erase this partition using a Macintosh.Doesn't actually have 1GB capacity (even if you count the unusable part), doesn't even have 1,000 ""marketing megabyte"" capacity.I bought this for my aged parent's Macintosh and was horrified to see an undeletable CD image appear on the Mac desktop everytime it was inserted."
1,Computer still stores activity..............,"The product ""claims"" that when you remove the thumb drive from the computer, all activity that was done using the U3 technology is wiped off of the computer, as if there was no trace of any of that activity. THIS IS NOT TRUE!!!! I bought this for that ""claimed"" feature/security. After the first use, I asked one of the IT guys to check my computer, they can dig deeper into the computer than the normal joe. Needless to say, when I searched, there was nothing, but when they worked their magic, they came up with plenty of activity from this drive. If this is the reason your buying, know that no matter what you do, someone can find it, reguardless of the claim."
4,Practic,"the principal characteristc that I see is that is don't use cap, I has other but I forget where I put the cap."
2,Good for One Year,"I had my cruzer micro for 1 year (before they came out with the retractable models). And, after that one year, it stopped working. I could read everything off the drive and add to it, but I couldn't delete anything. So, now, I still have it laying around with a few kilobytes of free space and no potential. Now they have this new model: its retractable. I did some research and learned from other consumers that, even though its retractable, there is no cover, and it doesn't take long for the lint in your pockets to its their toll. Anyway, after shopping around, I found a company that delivers an analogous product but with a lifetime waranty for maybe $10 more. I thought it was worth it. Check out: OCZ Rally drives. Got mine and its hella good."
4,To anyone who is annoyed by the lame U3 additions,"There is a quick and easy way to turn your disk back to a simple mountable drive. For Mac users, it will eliminate the additional folders and the annoying ""Untitled"" CD image popping every time you connect; For the PC users, it will eliminate the whole applications suite and control panel loading when connecting.All you have to do is download the ""U3 Launchpad Removal Tool"" from the downloads section on SanDisk's site, and run it - it is quick and easy. Mac users note that this is a Windows app, so you'll need to do this from a PC.Once you're done, the drive reverts back to a clean and simple disk-on-key. Note that the removal utility initializes the drive back to FAT16 (probably for compatibility reasons) but you can then go ahead and change it to FAT32 or any other format you like.Enjoy"
1,Software defeats purpose of flash drives.,"After having an experience with slow startup speeds (and actually freezing a computer) with the 1GB Cruzer Micro with U3, I feel compelled to write this negative review. The mere existence of a software layer to access the flash drive defeats the main purpose of existence of flash drives: a fast and higlhly compatible interface. Any hidrance to this convenience makes the device a liability. I work at an educational institution wher I am responsibel for organizing presentation sessions in which speakers often bring their presentations in a flash drive. As a matter of policy, we will not allow speakers to plug in to our computers devices that run any kind of software in the background."
2,Beware of the U3 Bloatware that comes on the drive!,"I just bought the Sandisk Cruzer 1GB drive. Since I have only used it for about an hour, I have not had the hardware problems that some of the reviewers have mentioned. Problem is, it came with ""U3"" software, which auto-installed on my computer. As is outlined elsewhere on these posts, this adds a layer of software that I certainly DO NOT want involved in my flash drive usage. I went to the Sandisk web site, followed the directions to uninstall the U3, and the uninstall errored out!! Every time!![...]I now have an empty 1GB flash drive. Too bad it took me over an hour of grief to get to that point.Beware!"
1,"Nice concept, poor execution","Have tried 2 in hopes of curing the lost cap problem. No cap to lose, but the darn things collapse every time you try to plug them in. If you want to use these, your USB port needs to have enough clearance around it so that you can wrap your hand around the drive and hold the slider in the extended position with your thumb. Needs a stronger latch."
2,Try to get a product without U3.,"This flash drive worked well for 2 years, which warrants a 2-star review; it is compact and I appreciated the retractable jack. Unfortunately, the U3 system is finnicky in its compatibility with Windows: Works fine on 2000, fine on XP Home, crashed several computers at home and work running XP Professional.When I upgraded my PC's operating system and crashed it with this drive I attempted to disable the U3 system, which required a software update from the manufacturer. In the process of applying the update my drive was corrupted and became unusable; I didn't lose any valuable data, but all the inconvenience on account of a superfluous program is irksome.Long and short, try to find a simple mass storage device without any proprietary software, and if you do buy this thing, disable U3."
1,This is a downgrade of the original Sandisik USB drive,I hate that U3 software that it's included and there is no way to get rid of it!!!I totally regret about buying this product
3,Fair Storage Device,Good price for memory but weak casing. It breaks easily. You have to be very careful.
2,Sandisk not a good name anymore,"I thought that Sandisk was a trustworthy name when it came to memory. My experience has been that it is not. This is only the second thumb drive I've purchased and the first one was 5 years ago. Here I am thinking that All you have to do is plug the thing in, use it, eject it and take it out.But no. Sandisk has added something called U3 that gets in way of all that. It has Skype and some games on it. I don't want Skype or Games, I'm buying a thumb drive!!! And It seems that you can't eject this from the computer without getting an error message that something is still in use. I guess that would be the U3 software? So, you have to shut your computer down to safely remove the drive.I'll have to try removing the U3 software, and hopefully won't have any issues. I say save yourself the headache and go buy some other flash drive! I wish I had."
3,"Ok, but annoying","This product does what it says it will do. It is good for storing files, up to around 920 megabytes. The U3 software that it comes with is where this jumpdrive goes wrong. Even after you think you have deleted the software and all of its extensions, they continue to randomly pop back up. Also, every time you plug it in to a new PC it takes forever to use and tries to install the software once more.Basically if you need a drive this size, this works ok, but avoid the annoying software if you can and get a different one!"
4,Nice usb drive with one 1 minute additional step,"I agree with everyone else about U3. It is one of the most annoying software programs I have ever dealt with. But I zapped that thing in less than a minute. Just download the uninstall utility from the SanDisk website. After that, this is a pretty cool little gadget, I like that it retracts rather than having a cap. I tend to lose caps easily.I would have given the product 5 stars, but it deserves 4 because of the annoying U3 software."
2,"Great price, irritating software","Physically this is a great little product. Good price and a compact design. Fine until you plug it into the USB port on a Mac. At that point it auto-loads a disk image for the ""U3 System"". This is supposed to let you run applications directly from the flash drive. Unfortunately the software is PC only and there seems to be no way to remove the ""U3 System"" disk image or prevent the auto-load."
1,SanDisk Micro Cruzer 4.0 just stopped working,"For the second time, I have lost all my data on the 4.0 thumb drive. That is, the Cruzer Micro 4.0 just stopped working. It no longer reads as an added drive -- no error message, no nothing. This happened on a previous SanDisk Micro Cruzer 4.0 -- but I really thought I had just encountered a lemon, since SanDisk seemed like a reputable brand. The previous 4.0 blinked rapidly but would not read. This time there's not even the blinking, no nothing. No, to be more precise, while I wait for it to ""register"" (a process that typically takes a while, due to the U3 process built in), I notice a very momentary twitch of the cursor, a flicker of an hourglass, as if it's trying and failing to establish contact. Anyway, I won't be making THAT mistake again, but I'm open to suggestions for a better replacement product."
4,A lot in a little package,I bought this product because of the included security software it contained. The U3 software is a great addition to the ease of use of a flash memory stick.I would recommend this product to anyone that needs the quick transfer capability of flash memory but still would like password security protecting their files. It is a seamless integration with this product.
4,Cruzer Micro,"After breaking 2 flash drives earlier this year I decided to buy this one. It's great because the USB connection slides in and out, so I don't have to worry about losing a cap and then breaking the drive. It's been very dependable and the best flash drive I've owned so far."
3,"Technical manual, not a story","Although obviously carefully researched, and well written, this is much less a story and much more a technical scenerio guide. If one were studying the topic, then this is a well written highly desciptive what-if scenerio (which is what the character at the beginning describes it as being). However, there is little in the way of characters, and many of the passages require multiple reads to make sure you get the facts straight (and there are a lot of them). There is little suspense (as everything is simply stated, and other than wondering what will come later in the scenerio, there is little personal stake in the outcome. Wargamers looking for realistic scenerios to play with, this is a great book; people looking for a good story, look elsewhere."
3,Not very interesting,"I bought this book and thought it would give an overall picture of countries fighting in WW III. It deals mostly with naval actions and hardly any ground combat. I did not find this book enjoyable because I am not interested in naval warfare. The picture of the M1 tank on the front cover should be replaced with a ship since this is what this bookis mostly about. If you are a naval fan then this is the book for you. If you are a ground pounder, like me, then skip it or check it out at your local library."
4,Be careful buying this soundtrack if you are American,"By far, the music for this game is excellent. I would recommend buying it to anyone, as well as the game. However, you should note that when you purchase the original soundtrack, it is the original soundtrack of the game released in Japan, which does not contain the orchestrated version of the music you hear when you play the English version. The music is the same, but the sound is very very different!"
5,A compelling case against bullying and powerful remedies,"The Namies make a compelling case against bullying in the USA and all over the world and prescribe powerful remedies to Targets. What a marvelous piece of work! Gary and Ruth Namie established themselves as the leaders against bullying at work in the USA and internationally. Great insights make this powerful book an absorbing read and a ""must-have"" for every employee, whether subjected to bullying or not."
4,A Great Melbourne Mystery,"As an American recently transplanted to Melbourne, I think that Murray Whelan mysteries are great fun. They give a great sense of place and Melbourne has a lot of character. Murray is great character- a mid level political hack, smart not overly, brave,with a good sense of humor who keeps wandering into trouble. His political job gives Maloney a great chance to deliver political and social commentary. Great fun even if you're not down under."
3,Roomful of Roses,"I am a fan of Diana Palmer. To date, I have read a number of her books. All of her latest works and some of her earlier out-of-prints, too. Thanks to Amazon's out-of-print service, that is.Compared to her more recent writings, Roomful of Roses is definitely tame. Not exactly dull, just pretty average in terms of content. This could probably be due to the changing values and norms since the original publication of this book.The story line, though simple, still has some slight relevance in today's soceity. Small town reporter vs big time foreign correspondance. Both have an attraction with each other that goes way back. Throw in a big age difference and different goals in life--career vs marriage, complicate matters by tossing in a fiance, stir things up with morals, values,...One of the greatest solution ever discovered by mankind: Compromise. But the ""who, how and what"", readers will just have to find out on their own."
1,"Amateur, immature, poorly researched and pretty dumb.","I'm ashamed to have this book in my possession and will burn it today!This author writing about the occult is about like a devout Catholic writing about Atheism - no comprehension at all. (By the way - I'm neither.)I agree with my fellow reviewers from whom I've quoted:""...so annoying, I wanted to reach in the book and slap her...""""... dialogue is so bad (inane), I actually started highlighting certain bits to relate to my friends...""""...almost hear the cheese music as the 'action' unfolds...""""...one of the most poorly written books I have ever encountered.""If you're in the mood to make fun of someone's writing, this is the book for you.Otherwise, STAY AWAY!"
3,Interesting...but slow,"It took two tries to get into the book inorder to finish it. It starts off the slowest of any Mercedes Lackey book. However that said it's very interesting with the Aztecs/Incans byline and the second half of the book is very good. Her other Diana Tregarde book, Children of the Night is much better.I did find it odd that the story takes place in the 90's until I looked at the publication date in that same decade. I had never heard of these novels until now."
1,Wasn't able to finish,"I read a lot of books, probably four a week. I like horror, mystery, suspense, even an occasional romance (if humor is involved). I think this is one of the most poorly written books I have ever encountered. The dialog was atrocious and repetitive. The author skipped around so you didn't care for any of the characters. I only made it to page 85, and I gave up. I usually give a book 100 pages to redeem itself, but I couldn't choke through anymore. This is my first Mercedes Lackey novel, and my last."
4,Smouldering Water,"Pretty GoodNew Idea, but a pretty predictable plot. You can easily figure out the entire plot of the book from the first few chapters,especilally if you have read much else from this author."
3,Highly disappointing.,"Plot premise: There's an evil force loose in Dallas, Texas. Detective Mark Valdez calls in the paranormal troops, in the form of his old friend Diana. Diana supplements her Wiccan work with a lucrative career in writing romance novels.The force terrorizing Dallas is an Aztec God, sacrificing to add to his power supply, basically.There were many areas where the plot could have been fleshed out, and wasn't; there were areas in which the amount of detail given was of no relevance. I finished the book because it came highly recommended; however, I was glad that it was borrowed and not purchased. New, it wouldn't have been worth the money."
5,Excellent!,"I found this book really entertaining, and have read this book so much that the cover has fallen apart on me. It had chills running up and down my spine the first time I read it, to think something that old and evil could be lurking underneath our noses! I wish there would be more Diana Tregarde books, but, due to certain misguided actions taken by some individuals(According to an article published on the internet called 'The Last Straw', written by Ms. Lackey), Mercedes Lackey has decided not to write any more novels with this character. I think that's a darned shame because this is a very good series."
3,Not bad for an early work,"This book wasn't bad as far as plot goes. I know some Wicca practictioners roll their eyes at the idea of psi-bolts and empathic healers who remove bruises with a touch, but come on--this is a BOOK. It's supposed to offer something above reality. I enjoyed ""Charmed"" too, and didn't worry about the Hollywood effects, nor was I offended by its portrayal of Wicca.The only thing I wish Lackey had done in this book was a little more research into real brujeria/curanderismo. It's clear she took the scene with the Bruja straight from M.L. Devine's Llewellyn book (originally titled ""Brujeria"", subsequently released as ""Magic from Mexico"".) There were already books on curanderismo out there...I'd read them years before this book was published. Would have been nice to have a touch of reality here; although Devine's book was good, it was not what a majority of Brujas practice."
4,Great bow but the arrows are crappy,I really liked the bow it shoots great! but the arrows are way to short and the tips brake easily. Soon after getting this bow I got some different arrows. With the new arrows I could shoot almost twice are far as I could with the arrow that came with this set! So this bow is worth the money but I would expect to be buying new arrows soon.
4,You will like it,"It's strong, gives you the feeling that you're looking for if you're not after a toy. Best range 15 feet, after that it becomes a toy. Within that range you don't invest much ($) and you feel totally rewarded. It comes with 2 arrows, buy more because you'll lose weight going back and forth to collect the arrows."
3,"Pretty Good, But With Bad Edges","So, I'm a beginner archer and i baught this set. It took forever to get here. The bow itself is pretty good, but is hard to string without a bow stringer so i recommend buying one. The arrows are a different matter. It come with two and a really flimsy quiver. One of the nocks in an arrow broke after a few shots. I'm not kidding either. The tips dent very quickly. Today was my first day using it because i had to wait for my bow stringer to get here. I'm highly considering buying more arrows. The picture doesn't show it but, the set also comes with a target. The other things, like the finger guard and the arm guard are okay. The finger guard was barely more than a scrap of leather with holes in it and the arm guard was really tiny."
4,"Good, but could be better","The bow is great, but the accessories are lacking and it comes with only 2 arrows. If you choose to buy this product, be sure to buy extra arrows with it so that you will not run out."
3,"Bow was nice, but set was not a set.","I probably would have given this product a 5 Star rating, however it was sold as a set, given as a Christmas gift, but was missing the arm guard and finger tab. Having given it to a nephew as a gift, I was miffed that these two items were not in the package. The bow looked to be very nice."
4,Bear Archery Tiran Bow Set,Good quality bow. Very rugged. Highly recommend for target shooting for ages 10 and up. Finger guard and arm guard are junk. If you buy the set plan on purchasing separate safety equipment.
4,"Good Box, Terrible Arrows","The title says it all. My son loves the bow. It's a little powerful for him, which is exactly what he wanted. The arrows started shedding fletches the very first time he tried them. And the finger grip is little better than stiff paper.Nonetheless, for the money, this is a good buy."
4,"Great product, great price. Does not come with protective case","The stylus comes in a 'case' that consists of thin plastic with cardboard backing packaging, which is then placed in a dime bag. If you buy it in at Guitar Center, it comes in a secure protective box so the delicate stylus does not get crushed.Luckily mine came intact so i'm not complaining. Most people end up throwing the plastic case away anyway but for some this may be something to note.Other than that, it works like it should. Am happy with my purchase."
1,it lasted less then a year....,"After less than a year the plastic 'thingie' that makes it turn on broke, and there is no dealer anywhere in sight (I live in PA).....so i am looking for a new one...."
3,Book Review for The House on South Street,"The House on South Street is a true account of a haunted house as told by John L Bisol, whose family owned the house for years. Bisol begins the book by providing readers with a history of ghosts and haunted houses, and then segues into the history of a particular house his grandparents lived in for a number of years; the South Street house. Bisol takes us through the years from his childhood to present day as he regales us with creepy stories and frightening accounts of his experiences with the haunted house. Because the book is true history, it provides great entertainment although it does lull in some places. The House on South Street really makes you think twice about the truth behind hauntings.I received this book free from Dorrance Publishing as a review copy."
3,Nice cd,Its a nice cd with a mixture of african and american music. If you like the music from the movie then you'll like this.
4,Nobody Cares,Deborah Cox is an essential addition to this soundtrack. Nobody Cares is an awesome song.
1,Waste,"I just couldn't get over the pink neon color of the conditioner. So, I just crushed REAL garlic and mixed it in with my own conditioner/oil for deep conditioning. Won't buy again."
3,Fast shipping,My order shipped to me very quickly! I was impressed with the timing. I am using this product to stop my hair from shedding. It's only been about a month of me using it consistently and so far so good.
1,not garlic scented but not unscented,I was looking for Unscented Shampoo and Conditioner because of asthma and COPD But this stuff is quite the opposite and very strongly scented. Smells nice but strong. I understand its unscented garlic but the discription lead me to believe the products were totally unscented.Nutrine Garlic Conditioner Unscented 16 oz.Nutrine Garlic Shampoo Unscented 16 oz.
4,Good Fun!,"Please don't let the violent beginning put you off this wonderful novel. (Thanks to the Amazon reviewer from whom I took this clue!)One of the better Reginald Hill novels. Reminds me a bit of Cure For All Diseases, which is one of my favorites, and April Shroud, which is another, but does stand on its own really well. And I do adore Sgt. Wield.Yes, Hill has so many characters that it's hard to keep track of them sometimes, but it's worth the trouble!"
3,"Three Stars, but Only for the Writing Style","I didn't like this Dalziel/Pasco thriller because it was simply too involved. Too many names to remember. Too many rich, imperious heirs. Too many cops. A plot not very compelling. What I DID like is Hill's wonderful writing. His irony and artful use of the language were delightful. If only he had turned a plot as well as he turned a sentence."
3,I guess it's good if you're a kid,YA/Trade: I got this book as a gift from Goodreads. I guess if I was a kid I would have enjoyed it more. The sentences and characters are simple. I started it at one time & got distracted and finally came back to it. It's a horror story in the genre of Goosebumps: Killer snowman seeking vengeance for a 20 year-old murder.
4,expensive but worthy supplement,"Mark Miner does an excellent job reading the paradigms, vocabulary, Practice and Review, Sententiae Antiquae and verious readings from each chapter. Hearing the words (proficiently) read aloud does help with comprehension. The severe R trills and staccato rhythm in some places irritated me a little, but I was able to get over it and ""get"" the material. When I went back to listen to previous chapter sentences, I was surprised to discover I understood what he was saying without having to mark syntax and translate each word.All in all, I would recommend these CDs for any serious Latin student. The price is a bit steep in my opinion, but ultimately worth it."
3,Medium,"While this satisfies my bottom line need to hear Wheelock's spoken, it is not without problems. I'll start by saying that the reader is very good, very articulate. But the sound levels jump around a bit which is distracting, the choice was made to say the number of each list item (in English) which grows tedious, and most importantly, there is a dearth of Loci' Ant'iqui' and Loci' Imm'ut'at'i. At this price, there simply ought to be a lot more."
2,Totally subjective,"I have no argument with the content or accuracy of the cd and there is simply only one reason that I rated this so low --- I found the guy's voice/pronunciation just so annoying. Reading my own words I realize this is really harsh but I honestly just couldn't listen to it for long. Totally subjective, I realize."
5,A very real look at life,"A gentle book with such a strong message about faith in life. I can read it over and over and gain more and more inspiration, depending on how I'm feeling that day."
5,I't's Only Rock n' Roll.........,"bests 20 songs of this fabulous Band.i just love this bandfabulous voicefantastics guitars playersand really,really goods songsif you don't know it, buy this cd !!"
2,3 Years,"I really like this stereo, it has tons of features at a great price.One User Interface complaint that have is with volume knob is also used to select setting when you press it directionally (left, right, up and down as opposed to turning the knob for volume). With the volume knob used for multiple things I find myself changing options when I am trying to change the volume.The reason for my review and the low score is after 3 years the RCA output developed a short. My right speakers where cutting out on me. After much trouble shooting I figured out the problem was a loose connection in the RCA jack at the rear of the unit."
5,One of the Best Xbox Games This Year,"This is a great game, one of the best I played. I hate plateformer games but Conkers Bad Fur Day(which is remade into this game)is so fun and hilarious. They make fun of Saving Private Ryan, The Terminator, Star Wars, The Matrix, Jaws, and Alien. I was laughing so hard that I played it again. The multiplayer is awesome, the story of the single player mode of it is that it takes place after Bad Fur Day in which the SHC(squirels battle the Tediz in a war that expands 300 years. You can play either as the SHC or the Tediz. Also it includes different classes of soliders like the Assasin, Bazooka, Sniper, Pilot, Flamethower, and a Solider. The maps are really cool, and depending on the map you'll fight in either the old war or the future war. I highly recommend this game, if you wanna see squirels drink beer, swear, pee, and blow up stuff get this game"
3,Different...,"Conkers Bad Fur Day is my favourite game on N64. I would still play it today if the controllers weren't so useless.The port of the original is very good, looks great and the sound is awesome, its really great to play through the game again, especially with a decent contorller. But what i sadly miss is the original multiplayer. I used to play it all day, it was easily the best multiplayer game on N64. But its nowhere to be found. Instead it has been replaced with a super-complex brand new multiplayer. It really is a fantastic multiplayer but its a wee bit too complex for me. I much prefer the original one. If only it were put on this version then I would be completely happy."
2,DOO DOO,"Im not going to write a long review but I will say that this game is really boring and the combat is terrible, a typical rare game with great graphics and crappy gameplay. At least its not 1 of thier usual collectathons."
3,Kinda overhyped,"I thought this game would be better. Conker's Bad Fur Day lives up to the expectation and has improved since the N64 release but the multiplayer is a letdown.The characters on the opposing team are too hard to see because their name and life meter get in the way. Some of the levels are pointless with objectives that make no sense but there is alot that make up for all of that such as the graphics and humor. Especially when you unlock ""potty mouth"".I like the game but it could've been better"
5,What is the deal?,"ok, let me point somthing out. Im 13. I played and beat gta vice city and San andreas. I saw team america, and the south park movie. For gods sake, the puppets have sex in team america! How could people say this game is worse then that? Its a game! sure those kids in jersey Imatated gta vice city, but that is only because he was bullyed. Im sure though i have not played the game is not worse the the gta games, south park, and team america... and the south park movie"
2,Conker is in the toilet!,"The game physically was in perfect shape and got here in a timely manner. My son and I were going to set down and play it for awhile after dinner one evening, and it was the pits! We both have played the original and loved it. He is used to the XBOX 360 controls and still couldn't get the hang of it. It really sucks and starts in the place you left off in the original, lame!"
3,Awesome,"Warning to Parents: Intense Violence, Gore, Strong Language and Sexual ContentConker, the most amazing squirrel comes to the Xbox! This game has super graphics, about 50 times better than the origanal on the N64. This game is very fun where you can use shotguns, Sub-Machine Guns, tanks, and more. The multiplayer is decent. In mutiplayer, it's a bit hard to switch weapons, reload, get in vehicles, and move. The single-player is the only good part of the game. In campaign mode, you have to defeat at least 5 bosses,collect a few million $$$, and do many fun missions. The campaign mode is a PLATFOTMER, not a shooter. If you're buying this game for campaign mode, rent it first. There are many puzzles and humorous spoofs such as the terminator and alien. Overall this is a fun game, but if you're easily grossed out and get bored with games with puzzles, don't buy it. Hope this review was helpful."
4,Conker's Live and Reloaded,"This is a great game for anyone who has a sense of humor. The single-player in this game is exactly like the N64 version, but the multiplayer is completely different. Altough I think that the multiplayer for the N64 is alot more consistent with the singleplayer gameplay, the multiplayer in this version is also very good. It's essentially a WWII style shooter, but with squirrels and tedeiz. Very entertaining to blow the stuffing out of a teddy."
4,conker live and reloaded,its a pretty cool i bought it for my brother but i ended up playing it for a bit..Its a unique game you wont find another one like it.
1,Demo's suck,"This game sucked because it wasn't what I paid for it was a Demo version of the popular game Conker, and the Demo Version is worthless. And the person that sold it to me is even more worthless than the game because he wouldn't even admit to accidentally selling me a Demo copy, and insisted that I went out and bought a Demo disc to make him look bad, well he did make himself look bad by being stubborn and swearing he didn't send me a Demo disc even after I sent him a picture that clearly showed that it Said Demo."
1,What a huge dissapointment...,"O.k... Bad Fur Day is one of the best games ever made...I give you that , ... We all are fans of the game , .. that's why this version was so anticipated , ... But we basically got the same thing...The ""LIVE"" , game , really , really sucks , ... There's so much going on the screen , that you can't even tell who's who , or what's what... I understand that each character has a name , for online pourpuses , .. But it's really confusing , ...Buy this game , if you havent played Bad Fur day , ... but if you already played it , ... be warned , that the multiplayer ... it's not that good , ... you'll probably play it , twice before you get bored and move on...."
3,Uninspired and uninspiring,"I was expecting something dark, progressive, listenable (multiply) and instead was given something dark. This album could be a perfect symbol for the problem with a lot of the dj albums being released today. No forward thought, little emotion, let's kick it up a notch people!! Especially for $25, sheesh!!"
2,Disappointed,"satoshie's nubreed was such a masterpiece i was expecting something better or at least, just as good. the CD has the timing skills satoshie is famous for but none of the edge or the heart."
3,uninspired and uninspiring,"I bought this album purely on reviews after having purchased a few of the global underground series by nick warren et all ( which are totally worth it ) and am disappointed. There isn't anything on these two cds that transitions to something beautiful or even something that makes you move. The music is sterile and dull. Don't buy this album purely on reviews, listen to a few of the tracks in full before making your decision."
4,Great monitor for the price!,We LOVE this monitor! Our 3 year old and baby sleep upstairs and we're on the main level. We have the monitor plugged in in the baby's room and we can hear him breathing. And if our daughter wakes up we can hear her too even though she's across the hall. The only downfall I have found is that it doesn't have rechargeable batteries and it doesn't go very far distances. It works fine as long as we use it within our yard and it's plugged in. I would highly recommend this monitor is you're on a budget.
1,shirt,very high priced and did not send me what i ordered and charged a very high price for shipping and handling
5,Excellent book teaching nontrivial material.,"It's not easy to build a really good online community website. There are a lot of things to think about, and many of them have little or nothing to do with technical programming skills.Buy this book, read it, step through it, and learn from some of the best teachers on the subject. And then when you've learned what they have to say here, take your new-found skills and build your own online community site. Using the methods in this book, your web sites can be more useful, successful, and profitable."
5,Reasoning from the Scriptures with the Catholics,"Being born and raised Catholic, this book really opened my eyes. When you compare the Catholic beliefs to the ""real"" scriptures, not the Catholic translated works, I realized how I have been kept in the dark for so long. Excellent book, based on scriptural facts. The Author has done his research and homework. This book is not meant to offend Catholics, it is a Bible Study showing the differences in Catholism vs: what the Bible actually has to say.Great Bible study ~"
1,"Yawn, another exercise in humanism.","Protestantism is based on the concept of Sola Scriptura, yet, prior to Luther, nobody taught it(except for those recognized by both Catholics and Protestants recognize as heretics).Scripture clearly teaches adherence to Tradition, that The Church is the Pillar of Truth.Therefore, one who would try to argue against Catholicism from scripture is ultimately doomed to failure, for if one understands the New Testament in its proper context, one understands it from the perspective of Tradition, and therefore cannot use it to argue against tradition.Don't wast you're money. Read something by Karl Keating or Scott Hahn."
1,Reasoning With Catholics,"I think one of the major problems that people like Rhodes are going to be running into is that there are so many well-read converts to the Catholic faith in the United States. We've not only read Hahn, Keating, Cavins, Howard, Madrid et al, we've also read the writings of the Early Church Fathers and the saints and the history of Christianity and......and,oh yes. The Bible. Yes, that very same Bible that Rhodes proposes to ""reason"" with us from.One of the biggest problems for people like informed Catholics reading books like this one is that the writers have a tendency to only want to consider verses from Scripture that support their own pet beliefs, while conveniently ignoring the entire breadth of the Holy Scripture. This is always a big mistake and Rhodes makes it here, over and over again. It really tries the patience of Catholics who know their Bibles to be put in the position of having to convince evangelicals and fundamentalists that the Bible is actually true."
1,Any Protestant book against Catholic Church is full of LIES,"Ron obviously does not know what the Catholic Church teaches. Any book that is written against the Catholic Church would not be a good book on what Jesus actually taught. Any good devout Catholic would be able to blow this guy out of the water in a debate, EASILY! This book is full of holes. I've read better books from Protestants against the Catholic Church, even though those books are also full of holes & lies.If only people would really search and learn what the Catholic Church actually teaches; they would all become Catholic.I've read ""andywick's"" review. He seems like a smart reasonable guy. His review is several years old already. I wonder if he's Catholic by now! :D"
1,Converted to Catholicism thanks to this book,"Like one of the writers below, I too converted to the historical Christianity which is Catholic Christianity after doing research on my own from all the points that Rhodes brought up. Rhodes skipped the dangerously anti-Sola Scriptura verse in 2 Timothy 3:16 because that clearly discards the second ""pillar"" of Protestantism because it clearly refutes the 16th. century teaching of the Protestant movement. Scripture is USEFUL or PROFITABLE NOT sufficient or enough for all Christians. It is the Church which is the ""pillar and foundation"" of the Truth (1 Timothy 3:15). I am now within that Church. So if you want to remain Protestant but have an open mind and a willingness to do the legwork, this book is NOT for you."
2,Catholics already have the Gospel!,"""I would not have believed in the Gospel had not the authority of the Catholic Church moved me.""- Augustine of Hippo"
1,The usual Anti-Catholic diatribe,I remember Ron Rhodes on the Bible Answer Man radio show. He's the one that got me exploring the Catholic faith. His reasoning from the scriptures should really be reasoning with other evangelicals about Catholicism. My only regret is that it is too light of a book to use as a door stop.
1,Would not recommend!!,"The idea of this product seemed good. I purchased it for a co-worker who has been losing his eyesight, and wanted his computer monitor magnified. The way his desk was set up, this product was too big/awkward to even set it up. But that wasn't necessary, as we held the magnifying screen in front of the monitor to test it. Not only was it blurry (however not to me as much as it was to him), but it did not appear to magnify much at all, if any. I ordered this one because it was the only monitor magnifier I could find that would fit his 21"" monitor. But I was disappointed. Good idea, but not a very good product!!"
1,Not for me,I found this item to be entirely too bulky for my needs. It was hard to attach to my computer's configuration. I also thought the visual aspects to be somewhat distorted.
2,Altoids Spearmint Gum,The Gum was in two weeks of expiration when sent to me. I would not trust Amazon again.LLF
5,More than we had expected,"My husband and I were a little skeptical about this bedding set for several reason, but once we received it we were instantly happy with our selection. The material is very soft and neworn friendly. The comforter is made up of velvet material so soft you'll want to constantly run your hands over it. This set made it very easy to bring in new colors we wanted to incorporate into the room. The sticthing is of very good quality, and the material itself seems very durable. This bedding set also goes well with a number of finishes when searching for the perfect crib. The price was perfect, and better here than we found anywhere else. This is a product I'd recommend and buy for my friends and family."
5,Amazing product and works overnight,"This products is all natural and does not have the chemical ingredients that cause side effects like other over the counter products at the pharmacy. It works very quickly to relieve pain, discomfort and it heals within a day or so. I highly recommend it to anyone. Fantastic, reliable product. :)"
5,Cool Plot!,"It's Detective Donuts birthday, and they call him for a case becuase Professor Drake was missing. The goose was not Professor Drake's assistant. His birthday present was not what he subspected. This children's book is perfect for people who like mysteries mixed with humor."
2,It ain't necessarily so. . .,"Making a book out of so-called eye-witness accounts is a wonderful idea, making for fascinating reading. However, there is a question of the reliability of some of those ""eye-witnessess."" The John Evelyn account of a circumcision in Rome,in 1645, is nothing but a piece of blatant anti-semitism. It propagates the idea of Jews as blood drinkers and practishioners of filthy rites (they are depicted as drinking a mixture of wine, blood, and spittle). The fact that the editor of this volume didn't know better than to include this piece of arrant and evil nonsense suggests, at best, that his mind was elsewhere at the time, that he didn't know better, or (less charitably) that accepted this view of Jews. In any case, the history is poor.Alex Levy"
5,The single most interesting book I've read,"I love this book! If there was one book I could take to the proverbial desert island, this would be it. I've read it so many times, and always find something new to delight in. The publisher should reissue it, I'm tired of lending it to friends."
3,Pet Booster makes riding safer,This is a good product for the front seat of a car if you have a head rest it works perfect with out a head rest it doesn't work so well.
2,Just OK.,"While the idea is great, in reality the car seat doesn't work that well. It could be that the seller sent me an item that was a return, and didn't include any instructions! The front part of the seat just hangs there, easily allowing your dog to slip off the seat, and making it an unsteady ride. There is a clip to hold the dog in, but they slide around since it's not constructed right. I don't know, maybe if the seller sent me a new one, with instructions, I'd know if perhaps I installed it incorrectly, but I don't see any other way to do it. I use this for short trips only, I don't trust it for more than that."
1,Dissapointed,"A friend of mine suggested I order the HoMedics Ortho Therapy Memory Foam Cushion Cluster Pillow. He loves his, but when the one I ordered arrived, I felt like I was lying on a large rock. If you love firm pillows, then this pillow might be for you. However, it was not for me and I sent it back."
4,Most enjoyable!!!,"This book was a pleasure to read! It was highly enjoyable, had a perplexing and well thought out plot and was a book that has a permenant spot on my bookshelf!"
1,A waste of time,"A good idea from a generaly good writer, but fails miserably. Talk about ruining a perfectly good and reasonable plot, this book does that briliantly. Read the author, not this book."
1,Amps power is greatly over rated,"Amps real rms power is nowhere near whats stated. If you are looking for 1000 watts rms or greater, this will not get you there."
1,Can't handle the load.,"I bought this to replace my 6 year old Rockford-Fosgate 2400w 2channel amp (which has since been re-installed). I had this amp hooked to 2 1200w peak 400w RMS subs @ 4 ohms and the amp cannot handle the load at 1/3-1/2 power for more than 2-5 minutes without needing to be reset then will handle for less than 2 minutes before another reset, and so on. The only way to keep it running has the volume so low that you are better off with a stock setup for bass. If you want real bump, buy a real name-brand true RMS rated amplifier that will last you several years instead of several minutes."
3,could be better,"The washer does the job. I gave only three stars because of some inconvenient annoying issues. 1. It is difficult to start when cold. You have to prime it just right. Too little or too much prime results in a sore arm pulling the start cord. 2. The nozzle hose does not fold up well. It's near impossible to get it neatly stowed away on the brackets provided. 3. The suction tube for adding a cleaner doesn't syphon as it should. I usually just pre sray the area with the additive and power nozzle it off with the dirt. It's a gas hog and be sure to check the oil level often as it uses it too. But when you get it going, the presure is plenty and the different nozzle heads work as directed."
2,Still waiting for part,"I received the product a month ago. A wheel had broken during shipment. Amazon would not allow it to be returned, but is working on getting a replacement wheel. Product may be OK (other than poor packaging and shipping damage), but I have not been able to use it yet. I have been waiting for the wheel for 3 weeks now."
5,Great show,Archer just blows me away I love all the voice actors and the writing just has me in stitches every episode and being animated lets them do so many things they could never get away with in live action.
4,My secret little guilty pleasure!!,"Late one night I was channel surfing,and wound up catching a episode of Archer. What a riot!! It's like Charlie Sheen playing 007 as Charlie Harper!! If you looking for a laugh, I highly recommended this DVD...too funny!"
5,great series,"i love comedys and im glad this has appeared. family guy and south park have slowly been going downhill for me but this is hilarous. its smart and theres so many small things u miss first time u watch it. ull find yourself saying ""rim shot"" and ""phrasing"" all the time without thinking it. its the new ""thats wat she said"""
5,LAAAAANNNNAAAAAAAAAAAAAA,You're in the DANGER ZONE. Reading reviews won't help you decide about this show. Just watch it. And be ready to laugh.
5,Funny in a Smart Frat Boy Kind of Way,"Wait - ARE there smart frat boys? Well, I can tell you I'm not in the target demographic for this show (too old, too female), but I think Archer is a hilarious series. Just the mommy issues alone are worth it."
5,The most sharks shot in the face,"Yes. A tasty slab of Archer with a side of comedic heavyweights (David Cross is a snug fit). If there is a place in hell for writers who just piss away an amazing show after a couple of great seasons, these writers will be peeing off a cloud onto that place, and will probably eat some asparagus beforehand. I am a smiling slave to this show. Oh, and if you don't catch it all on the first go, you can trust that it will age well."
4,Love Archer,Again I love the show but it only gets 4 stars because of the streaming quality form the end of Amazon.com
4,Archer is always good for a laugh!,"My husband and I LOVED the first 2 seasons, so of course we bought the 3rd. I think it's a tiny bit less funny than the previous 2 seasons but still worth it. This is still one of our favorite tv shows. I would recommend it to any adults with a sarcastic sense of humor. But only for adults.....I wouldn't have your 5 year old watch this unless you want them to pick up some crude humor....."
5,Don't just sit there sweating like a big cheese,This is by far one of the funniest shows on television right now. Each season is better than the one before it. I have probably watched each one through four times and still laugh and find new jokes. The characters are hilarious and the situations are perfect. Go out and get this series immediately!
5,Archer rules,"Season three doesn't disappoint. Why more people don't know about this show is beyond me! Fine, let it be our hidden treasure. some of the best comedy writing on TV ever."
5,Wit and terribly off color humor,"Archer is still one of the wittiest shows on television today. In fact, the only reason I am writing this review is because it is so good other people should see it. Be warned, it may take 2-3 episodes to really accept it. but it's worth it if you can."
4,Wonderfully iconic,"I love James Bond, I love Jason Bourne and I really love Sterling Archer. This animated series is such a whackadoodle take on James Bond and Jason Bourne done with a 60's flair that it's hard not to rewatch it over and over. Great kudos to the voice talent."
3,consistent with Seasons 2 and 1,"If it's your kind of thing, you'll like it . . . some find Archer too risque. Beeyootiful watercolor-ish graphically."
5,great,Great episodes. The quality is still there after three seasons. Watch these episodes several times and will again and will again.
1,Misleading,"On the buying screen, it says that this title is rated TV:MA. MA stands for ""Mature Audiences"", but obviously with a guidline like that they still dont think that you're mature enough to hear all of the profanity that mature adults should hear. This not only cuts away from my viewing experience, but it cuts away from the Archer series as a whole. This will be the LAST time I will buy movies or videos from your site if this does not get change."
5,Love this show,"Honestly one of the funniest things out there. Maybe it just hits my particular brand of humor, but I laugh my ass off watching it."
5,Oh Archer....,This is one of my guilty pleasures. I wanted to hate this show... I really did. I can't help but love it. So politically incorrect and perverse yet totally hysterical.
5,A moving tale,"There are not many books that can bring me to tears, but this one did it. The lives of the people in the book are as amazing as they are sad. It reminded me just how strong some people can be. And just how evil others can be. In the middle of the worst natural disater in history people were actually praying on those who had just lost everything. I spent some time in Thailand years ago, but I only went to the tourist places. After reading this book I know I am going back. I have a totally different outlook on the country and the people now. I think sometimes when we go to foreign countries and do the whole tourist thing we miss out on the beauty. This book has shown me what is beautiful about Thailand--it's people. I think this book will open a lot of eyes."
3,Coffee,"The coffee was good, however for the price I would consider other brands. It was not as robust and brilliant as other coffees I have ordered from amazon...."
1,Don't bother ordering,"one month after ordering this product I get a message that it has been cancelled, it is no longer available, that was two days ago, and yet today it is still listed on Amazon as in stock. Which is a lie.Don't bother wasting your time with this seller."
1,"Certainly not scientific, a ""cute"" but overrated book.","This book was written, it seems, for a below average intelligence. This book is a poodle in the dogworld - all fluff and no bark! I am a first-time dog owner who looked to this book for advice - only to find common sense. Many of the chapters are only 3 pages long; the authors tease you with a few sentences of information then quickly change to a new topic. Don't waste your money on the hardback- if you have taken your dog to obedience school you know more than you think!"
5,A fun book !,"What a great, uplifting book - for all dog lovers! The authors captured great topics with light easy reading paragraphs on each topic. I have read it twice and plan to read it again. The book is like a big Dog Magazine with short interesting chapters!"
2,book that attempts to answer everyday questions about dogs,"While the authors have their hearts in the right place, I found their answers to be simplistic and generally falling in line with what a dog lover would want to hear. It's not a compilation of research that the authors have done; rather, it is a compilation of other authors and things that they have written about dogs. The writing style bothered me too... although this could be a personal peave that bothers only me. I felt like I was reading a National Enquirer or Globe article in the line at the grocery store - not of the ""my baby is an alien"" variety, but along the same lines as a ""news"" story on whether dogs can talk to cats, for instance."
5,Censorship?,"How does Amazon justify pulling this film? And after only 3 days on sale because of ""performance issues?""Wow. That's a great way to lose the faith and trust of your customers--not to mention your shareholders.Please reconsider, do the right thing, and make this very important film available through your website."
5,The Truth Hurts,"As a regular ""customer"" of Amazon I feel compelled to comment on their inappropriate action in banning the sale of this DVD (which can be found on their own web site ([...]). The continued trampelling of individual rights, as shown by Amazon's actions, of free speech is outrageous. Fortunately, the American people are not so anesthetized that they can not recognize that The Truth Hurts.Bill Still did a masterful job in outlining monetary history, and the Secret of Oz merely shows how the economic events of the late 1890s led to the creation of the world's most popular story which had its feet clearly in the policitical arena. The DVD should be viewed by any concerned American and its merits judged by each individually, not by the imposition of a ban."
5,Wish to Purchase,"After seeing the video trailer, I came to Amazon to place an order. To my chagrin it could not be purchased on your sight. That's okay, I will purchase it somewhere else.This will prove to be a wonderful learning tool for my students in teaching Economics from an approach that is seldom heard from in a society that says, 'Give it to me NOW.'Maria Ricci"
5,What a brilliant move on Amazon's part!,"It's too bad that Amazon won't carry this DVD. I just ordered 4 of them (1 for myself and 3 as gifts) from the publisher. I guess you either caved in to a request from .gov for censorship or made a really stupid business decision. Oh well, I don't have to buy from you either. Enjoy your self-made recession, and be sure to give the doofuss who made this call a raise!CJA"
5,This is a great video.,"I want to buy it for a friend, Its a good video. Why can't I buy it on amazon?"
5,All true Americans should know the secret of OZ,All Americans should know the secret of OZ. Knowledge is every citizens freedom no matter what side of any argument. Excellent informative documentary.
3,"best I could find for 2 kids-functional, but could be more stout","Two kids in the back like to fight over movies. Bought 2 of these Christmas '06 so kids can switch back and forth. This was the only unit I could find with a switchable in/out jack (also works for games) so they can watch the same movie if desired. One unit out of the box would not keep lid closed, so I used velcro tape to keep it closed. Joey broke off the input wire in the jack, so it no longer works, and the player also stopped reading discs, so it is dead, Chloe dropped the other onto a tile floor and broke the door switch so I taped a plug over it to bypass it and taped the door with velcro as well. I think they're on their last legs but have seen a lot of abuse over the last year and a half. But- they were a Godsend on longer trips- would do it again."
1,Buyer Beware.,"About 2 weeks after the 90 day warranty period ended (happened to you before?), this unit stopped working. Not due to an electronic failure, but because the top and bottom piece (secured by a plastic latch system)just one day decided not to close properly. NOTHING WAS BROKEN ON THE MACHINE! The unit does work if I tape the two pieces together (Very attractive and functional).Talked to very nice people at Audiovox who basically said, in a NICE way, tough luck. Repair charge is $93.75."
2,Not soft pretzel salt,I bought this salt expecting it to be the large compacted salt granules you get on a soft pretzel. I was sorely disappointed when it arrived and it is the oversized granules of regular rock salt like you find on standard hard pretzels. Make sure that's what your looking for before you buy.
1,This is not pretzel salt,"Save your money especially for shipping, this is NOT pretzel salt. This salt is nothing more than kosher salt that you pay alot for shipping to your house, you can get this in any grocery store. I had purchased pretzel salt before from amazon and could not remember the company so I bought this, without reading the reviews. I have since found the company which is called the Spice Barn. I am not sure if they sell through amazon or not, but the [...] does sell that really white salt you get on soft pretzels. You can find them at:[...]"
3,Pretzel or Kosher Salt?,"While the price is very reasonable, I have doubts about it being pretzel salt. I compared it to pretzel salt I purchased from another site and to Kosher salt, and I have to say it appears to be Kosher salt. While Kosher salt is fine to use on pretzels, it really is a different product than pretzel salt. I'm no expert, but that is my opinion."
1,Not pretzel salt - just regular.,"Very disappointed in this item. It is not ""pretzel salt"" as one would think - it seems to be just regular table or kosher salt. This is not what I was hoping for."
1,Not what I expected,"This is not pretzel salt - it is closer to table salt. I was expecting large, white grains. This salt is nothing more than clear grains that are slightly larger than average table salt."
2,Why would anyone abridge this work?,It is incomprehensible to me to try to figure out why anyone would want to release an abbreviated version of this classic work of the English Language. It is equally mystifying to make sense of the reasoning behind buying this abridged version of an amazing historical literary masterpiece.
2,Blasphemy!,"To abridge Grant's Memoirs is to eviscerate one of the greatest books in the English language. It's like cutting out various chapters in the Bible, or cutting act three from MacBeth. Please don't buy this abridged version, every word of the original is worth reading and savoring. Abridging this classic of American literature is incomprehensible and baffling."
4,Wicked #10,"I reallly liked the ending. It was so unexpected. I don't like Marla Newman @ all! I really like Clarissa and Josie, and they were in it."
4,Better than the Rest,"Wicked was one of the best Seniors books I've read, and I've read all of them so far. My favorite was The Thirst, but Wicked comes right after The Thirst. Wicked wasn't as boring as some of the others, but it was still kinda predictable. But the cliffhanger at the end is killing me and I can't wait to read Prom Date. Mr. Stine should take a few notes from Wicked and The Thirst so that his other books can be as interesting as them, instead of totally boring like Sweetheart, Evil Heart. And as long as he doesn't kill my favorite character, Dana Palmer, I'm cool! :)"
5,This figure is awesome,"This figure is so cool. I just got it this week and it is so cool. Basically like everyone else has said, it has incredible detail like the silver tree on his clothes, the helmet, and even his feet are dirty. The only thing i dont like about it is that you can hardly take the cape off and when you do it is almost impossible to get back on again. I'll NEVER try that again. That is probably just for me though because i like to take off all of my figures capes and cloaks and weapons."
5,They don't expect me to fight do they,"This is a very nice figure. Pippin has a removable hemlet,and sword, with sheath. Pippin has the White Tree on his armor. This is a very good and flexible figure. My only compliant is that Pippin's sword does not fit very well in his hand."
1,Too Easy,"This workout is entirely too easy. Plus, she doesn't explain what you are supposed to do too well, which I feel like could result in injury for a lot of people who don't know too much about working out. I think the only one that seemed to make me feel anything was the calorie blaster. But hey, if you are new to working out, this video will be great if you are safe!"
2,Not Boot Camp,"This video only has 2 true boot camp segments, for the price it might be worth it but don't expect to be able to do all 5 and get a good workout. Has 10 minutes just for stretching and 10 minutes of ab work- both super slow pace."
3,Extras needed,I like doing workout dvd's at home when I get in a funk at the gym. I do like the dvd but you will need weights to do some of the workouts.....I'm not mad about that but other people should know so when they do the workout they are not leaving that out.
1,"DEFINITELY, not boot camp exercises!","First of all, being ex-military, I found this dvd totally appalling! Anyone whose been in the military can tellyou that first the exercise is demonstrated, then executed! This instructor, if she is one, was all over theplace! I was frustrated after one minute, thank God, I purchased this at a thrift store! Whoever gave it away, knewsomething I had to learn for myself! I like some of the ""10 Minute Solution"" dvds, unfortunately, not this one!PLEASE... I beg you, save your money!"
3,"Not very ""boot camp""ish","I thought this would have a lot more cardio, bootcamp style. There's a lot more toning, and the toning segments seem to alternate so much between picking up and putting down the weights that it seems like a bit of a time-waster."
3,3 good segments,"the aerobic moves were kind of difficult and corny. But the 10 minute abs, butt, and stretch segments are great."
1,Ack!,"Not the arrangements you're familiar with. Not the instrumentation you want. This is an ""EZ Listening"" version of Western Movie themes. Run away!"
3,Not too bad,"Recently, I bought this CD and it is not too bad.There are some great themes on it and some I don't like so much.But this is subjective."
1,Too flimsy,"These pans have no weight at all, they are bent tin. As soon as I got them I used one once and went and bought new ones at a store. They are not worth buying at any price"
3,Fair Price,"The pans arrived very quickly. They are fair priced for the quality.I've used them several times and they are already showing signs of ware. Again, they were fair priced for the quality.Overall, this is a decent inexpensive set of pans."
1,Dissappointed in these,"As noted in other reviews ( which I now wish I'd read before ordering these), the quality is very low. They are too light and the non-sticksurface started to chip away after only a few uses. Save your money."
2,Very Weak,"A lethargic, slow, languid novel that seemingly has no story or sense whatsoever. The events unfold without any order and the characters lack depth -- they have a sort of a wooden feel. Nothing seems real, or even remotely possible! This is my second Narayanan novel -- the previous one being Waiting for the Mahatma which I read over my break in India -- and I have to say, I am thoroughly underwhelmed by this novels as of now. Is this the genius that people seemingly adore? I am not going to give up however, some more of Narayanan's tales are to follow, apart from my attempt at reading the work he is most famous for -- Malgudi Days."
4,A good mystery book.,"This book from Petros Markaris has been really amusing for me. It has a good plot and it is a good detective story with which you never know where it will take you. It is written in an amusing way (even in situations that describe something serious the author inserts some funny comments -sometimes even sarcastic- that you can't help laughing).I don't assign it five stars since at some points (not too many, though) it becomes too descriptive and therefore distracting from the main idea. However, if you like books about crimes and people trying to find the murderer, this book is for you."
4,black flood,good stuff takes a while to cook and will unleash a black /purple flood on everything you mix with it kinda spennndy for a lil bag o rice though
3,Chinese Black Rice,"Chinese Black Rice is interesting. It reminds me of wild rice. Doesn't have much flavor, but the level of starch is remarkably reduced. It doesn't have much volume, so you get just about what you put into the pot in terms of volume. It was interesting because I'd never had it before. I won't order it again."
2,To much work.,I have to admit upfront I am lazy and not a good cook. I bought this rice in attempt to get a easy solution for anti oxidants but I could not really dehusks these with out it becoming a pain. I understand most of you probably have no problem. If your cooking challenged like my self these were just not worth it.
3,Fast delivery,I haven't made the black chinese rice yet. I had a recipe calling for it but misplaced it. But they did arrive fast and they look good. I am going to try cooking just like regular rice and see how that goes. I will try to remember to come back and let you know. I only gave it three stars because I haven't cooked them yet.
4,Black Rice -- Great,"The black rice is well priced for a very fine product. You have to boil it for a long time (around 30 minutes) in order to break the outer skin. The effort returns a very tasty rice which makes eating the usual white rice seem to be a waste of time. The only small fault is that it is just slightly soggy, but only slightly and this comment should NOT put you off from buying what is GREAT high value-to-price ratio product."
2,Very Brief,"lasts about 2 hours on me, even if i prep the area with glycerin first. even during its active time, it doesnt project much. nice smell, but it just fails practically every other way."
1,watered down version of the real thing.,The bottle of cologne i got when i ordered this was very weak compared to the real stuff i've gotten straight from Victoria's secret. Just doesnt last long enough at all. I would put it on and by the time i got to work 30 minutes later it would already be gone. This is a very good cologne so if you are interested in this just buy it straight from the store. Yes it will be more expensive but at least you will get your money's worth out of it.
2,Very Sexy Him,"A very synthetic dark aquatic with poor projection and longevity. The top notes are very pleasing and women love the smell but it doesn't help this fragrance if you only smell it for 30 minutes and have to be neck deep to smell the dry down. I own about 60 fragrances and growing, this is one that collects dust due to its spotty sillage. A shame, this had potential. And if you don't mind re-applying often, this could be a great close quarters scent. Still, I can't help but recommend Blue De Chanel or Bleue D""Issey over this synthetic short lived mess."
2,Not the same as in store,"I have purchased this in the store multiple times and I love the cologne however the one I got seems weaker. I was not the only one to notice this either, one of my friends who loves this one said the same thing. I sprayed a decent amount on and by the time I got to work she could barely smell it."
5,love the scent,"This is a very nice product. I paid a lot less on line, then I could have in any store locally."
5,Fast Tan with very little effort,"This product is great for the price, its also better than expensive lotions I used.The first time I used it in the tanning bed I was three shades darker coming out. Also you can use it outside too and ,it works quite well If you want a tan fast with good results buy this!!!!!!!"
5,Fantastic! Been using for 4 years!,"I love this stuff! I started using it when I was 16. I love it! It works great for me. I have varily light skin and it was extremely hard to get any color. I would just burn and peel back to very pale. Once I started using this, I can now tan and get some color! It is not a sunscreen and I do not use it in a tanning bed. I've only ever used it outdoors but it helps. I would recommend this to anyone to try at least once."
3,Good but not necessary,I bought the cards for my daughter. She played with them to guess the correct answer. She would just press with the pen until a correct answer was announce by the music. The cards are good but not necessary to teach a child how to add.
5,"BRAVO Wendy and Maggi, GREAT JOB!","Finally, A well-written laugh-out-loud book about understanding relationships that does not bore you to sleep! Highly recommend to every living, breathing female AND male who wants to understand the thinking of the opposite sex! I feel this little book is one you will not want to put down because it is so ""right-on"" and entertaining at the same time! By far, the best ""relationship"" book I have ever read. Thank you Wendy and Maggi for sharing your knowledge in such an enjoyable way! You will not regret picking up this treasure chest full of bright, shiny gems of useful information. I am going to order three more copies for my friends!"
4,great for the price,"I just bought this glider/ottoman for $99. We had been shopping around and found many comfy ones for $500. I didn't want to invest that much in a piece of furniture I probably wouldn't use after the baby stage. The other ones in the $100 range were cheap..the fabric was ugly and crunchy (not cushiony). The glider has natural color wood that matches the crib and the fabric is khaki colored and very nuetral. I am very excited baout finding this chair. I was sitting in it last night and it is fairly comfy. If you have $500 to spare i suggest getting a nicer quality, but if your cheap like me this chair is great for the price."
2,Broken chair...,"When the item got to my house it was cracked, i tried to glue it but its not going to hold, i am due next week so i have no time to send it back and wait for a new one. other than that the glider looks and feels comftorable, if i wasnt so worried of falling out of the chair."
1,Chair/Ottoman Combo,We bought this rocker for our daughter's room. It is extremely uncomfortable and we actually ended up buying a different rocking chair to replace this one. The cushions are hard as rocks and there is NO way you could fall asleep comfortably during those middle of the night feedings. I would not recommend this chair to ANYONE!
5,great chair,i received this chair as a gift from my grandmother and it is very comfortable and super easy to put together. took me about 15 minutes to do it. it glides smoothly. and the back of the chair is high enough where you can rest your head on it which makes it more comfortable. i absolutely love this chair.
2,Not made well at all!,"I owned ths glider for 2 weeks when it broke. I weigh 130 lbs, didnt seem like a lot of weight at the time. However, one day when I sat down, the wood on the bottom broke in half. I'm still trying to get an answer from the company. My advice, dont buy this one!"
4,Great for the Price so far!,"I just purchased this glider/ottoman combination and have been satisfied to this point. I was afraid from all the negative reviews of shipped items that it might have come damaged. There was no damage and it was very easy to assemble.I just received the glider, so as far as longterm durability I cannot comment.All in all, it seems to be exactly what I was looking for and will do the job that it is intended to for me."
5,Yummy Chocolate,"I bought these for baking and it is a miracle that I am able to do so since everyone in the house seems to nibble on them here and there. They are easy to bake with, melt quickly, have a wonderful taste and if you manage to hide them somewhere in the fridge where your family won't find them, they will keep quite well for several weeks. I've actually hidden several in the back of the freezer and then baked with them and the taste was still of the same high quality. Good price for a great chocolate."
1,filter doesn't fit,"This filter was supposed to fit my Honeywell air filter, but it doesn't. I called the mfg, they offered little help--even after I sent them photos of the difference b/t the filter they sent and the one being replaced (thier's was about 1/16"" to narrow--which is a lot for air passage). They did offer to refund 20% of the price, but that barely covered shipping. Bummer."
1,Don't Buy From This Company!!,"I placed an order for 2 filter listed as in stock, available for immediate shipping. Items aren't shipped as they're not in stock and an email arrives stating that. No info is in the email as to when they're expected, just a customer service number. Call to customer service, after a long wait on hold, reveals that the filters aren't expected for 2 weeks, placing the ETA at over a month from the order date. Customer service rep isn't thrilled about canceling the order, but claims it is canceled. Best of all, 8 were listed in stock when I placed my order, 7 are still listed in stock right now.Why would I guess I'll end up disputing this charge on my credit card..........?"
1,Buyer beware,"This is an after market, cheap feeling copy of the filter that came with the unit. I'm very disappointed. Shame on me for not reading reviews."
1,Not a good generic replacement,"Not an good replacement item for the 17000. Filter is white on outside and the width is different. Allergy be gone must use resellers to provide this item,as they don't care if they are misrepresenting the product on Amazon.They use keywords like Honeywell,Enviracare,etc.,never telling you its a cheap generic knockoff. Who knows how the size difference affects performance. I let it sit in the box unopened past 30 days when I was out of town.I don't know about a refund, but I'm not amused!"
2,Too expensive!!,Ive tried so many different air filters I lost count. This one ended up in the closet like the rest of em.
1,Not Quite Right,"This is not a Honeywell brand HEPA filter, it is a cheaper knock off. Unfortunately, both filters I bought from this company smell like machine oil. One was actually oozing the stuff. Now the house smells like motor oil; not good for those of us who are chemically sensitive. Not highly impressed; I would like to find a better vendor that carries these older replacement parts."
2,very generic product,"did not really appreciate the false advertising. this is not a ""honeywell"" filter and the box it arrived in is very cheaply and generically labeled. it is also white and the ad shows a black version."
3,New filter for my old air purifier,I bought this filter to eliminate cigarette odor. After a few weeks the purifier itself began to smell again. Maybe I should buy a permanent filtered purifier.
3,"The item is fine, but...",I ordered this item and the retailer (Allergy Be Gone) had the item as 'in stock' on their website. Ha! It took about a month before I got the product. And they didn't send me an email to say it was out of stock until I called them after waiting a few weeks!
1,warchild not good,Did not get the item I thought I ordered. Cannot contact or get feedback from the seller WarchildXX.
5,replacing a HEPA filter in your air cleaner,This fits my air purifier just fine & was easy to install. Check the numbers on you machine before ordering a replacement filter to make sure you get the right one. It works so much better than the old filter that we had used for several years. Be sure to get the pre-filters (quite inexpensive) too & replace those every few months to make the HEPA last longer.
3,"Cute costumer, but runs small!","I ordered this costume for my 3 year old son for Halloween. The costume is very cute, but you need to order 2 sizes up! I ordered the child's small and it was a little too small for my average-sized 3 year old. I am so glad I didn't order the toddler costume! My son normally wears a 3T, but there is NO WAY he could have worn a smaller size. We made it work, but he was uncomfortable in it."
3,Ran Small,"The costume was well made, but ran small. We ordered a 5-6 and it barely fit our 3 yr. old grandson."
2,"Sizing wrong, cheap quality for price","I ordered a size ""small"" (appropriate for sizes 4 to 6, according to the package.) The actual costume is so small my size 4T, 34-pound child just fits into it. Also, the quality is very poor. The fabric is thin, and the seams were threatening to separate as I put his arms in. If your child has his/her heart set on the costume, order the next size up and expect a cheap costume. Otherwise, just save your money."
3,"Good Enough, But Not To Overstuff","The fabric of this Scooby costume is pretty thin and cheap, but it's not like you're paying a mint for it. The hat didn't work very well on my granddaughter and the collar was kind of a joke. It had gotten bent up and because it was made out of thin foam, we didn't want to iron it. But the child was definitely recognizeable as Scooby and it was easy to get on and off as long as she had adult help so I would say this is a decent Halloween costume as far as things go. It didn't last very long for playing in, but Halloween was fine."
2,"Not the Deluxe Scooby costume, this is the standard.","Do not confuse this costume with the Deluxe one that is very plush and stuffed head. The head on this one is a very simple hood with a cutout attached to the top. The cutout does not stay in place and flops around. As others said it runs very small. My son wore it often for about two weeks and the seams came apart. Good for only a few uses. Thin, cheap material. I would recommend the other more plush style Scooby."
2,Poorly made,This is a poorly made costume. The snout of Scooby as seen in the picture (looks like the bill of a cap) is very poor. It doesn't sit down like you see in the picture unless you hold it there. It constantly flaps up which my son found very annoying. The costume as a whole is pretty cheaply constructed but in the end it got us through this Halloween.
2,Itchy,After five minutes she complained of itching and this was with clothes on underneath the costume. A definite bust all around.
2,Cheap product don't waste your money,"My son wanted a watch for x-mas, and loves power rangers. So I figured this would be a great gift. It actually hurts his wrist to wear it. Hard plastic band."
3,Stick to the originals.,"Gloria Gaynor made weird career moves during the 1980's recording for various labels. This collection contains some of Gloria's most popular tunes including ""I will survive"". Note that the tracks here are re-recorded versions of the originals. Some of the songs lack that classic quality. Maybe it was all a bad idea to re-do these songs all over again.The CD also features other cover songs, like 'Careless Whisper' and 'Every Breath You Take'."
2,Good only under ideal conditions.,"I bought these binoculars to use while kayaking, but the front lens caps will not stay securely in place,i.e., they're continually popping off, which means that under wet conditions one usually has to clean the lenses to make them usable. They are heavy and will only ""float"" when the rather bulky neck-strap is attached. (The product description fails to mention this.) The optics--under ideal conditions--are very good--a bright, clear image--but in a ""watersports"" environment, for which they are designed, they leave much to be desired. They'd be good dry-land birdwatching binoculars if they weren't so darn heavy."
4,More Pittsburgh historical fiction please,"I love historical fiction and actually bought this book without realizing it was a young adult book.I thought the book was well written overall. I live in Pittsburgh and I have never heard this story. I enjoyed how the author unraveled the mystery for the reader. I don't think a 14-year-old would appreciate the ending like someone a little older would though. I myself was divided on it. I thought it was interesting and it agreed with Jury's personality... On the other hand I felt like I didn't get the ending, the answer to the main question in the book.I agree with the other reviews (which I have now read) that the mom sub story should not be in the book and waste of good trees.I do think this book is worth the paperback price. I am also interested in reading more of this author's books, hopefully with adult characters set in Pittsburgh."
1,Awful!!!,It doesn't sound like Tommy Roe. It also is recorded so slow. I was very disappointed. I wish I had read other reviews before my purchase. I do not recommend this purchase for any fan of Tommy Roe.
3,I'm Not So Dizzy,"I thought this would have the original recordings but it disappointed me because they were more recent recordings of the original songs by this artist. Tommy Roe still sounded great but I prefer the original recordings over newer recordings of the same material. Had I known it was not the original recordings, I probably wouldn't have purchased this CD."
5,Fabulous,"This is a simply wonderful performance of one of my favorite composers, Monteverdi. The production was the production...it was fine, it was somewhat dated, but fine....but the performance was outstanding. That final scene of Baker and Luxon sends chills up my spine every time I view and hear it. I love period pieces done with period instruments, but I also love period pieces done with the most advanced instruments our ears have experienced. They both have their merit. But period or non-period,... the performance, singing and interpretation are the goal posts of excellence and they certainly have achieved that post."
3,Good for beginners,"Oracle 8 for Dummies, covered the fundamentals very well. I feel it is a good place to start for novices, but not intermediate and advanced database administrators. Oh yeah, and what about platforms other than NT?"
1,do not spend a penny on this book,"This is quite possibly the first book that I have ever considered returning because I felt ripped off for having bought it. Although never stated explicitly, it is quite obvious that the author assumes the reader is using a microsoft operating system. Had it stated as much anywhere, I would not have purchased it.In general, the book is woefully lacking in content. I am not sure why the author/publishers believe that a book on oracle needs to waste so much space trying to be cute."
1,"This book is more an ""Oracle for Dummies"" than anything else","With the given title of such a book, it is easy to assume that those who have knowledge of previous versions of Oracle would find this book an aid to quickly and easily using the new features. However it is merely full of ""padding"" on such irrelevant matters as Tables and Relationships. Most disappointing."
2,Disapointed,"I purchased a twin pack of this item only to have the hidden internal plastic parts break the first time temperatures reached below freezing. I called Bon-Aire, and they were pleasant to work with and replaced the item free of charge, but the second one also broke the very next winter. Still looking for a simple quality nozzle."
1,"Cheaply made, Do not buy this nozzle.",I really loved this nozzle while it worked. Unfortunately it broke into two pieces after a year and a half. The center piece behind the stainless steel sprayer is made of thin plastic and broke. And since the warranty is 1 year I'm SOL. I've had $2 sprayers last for years. This was a huge disappointment.
2,Performance Not As Good As Demonstration Seen At Home Show,"Spray patterns were not nearly as precise as those witnessed at a home show demonstration. Also, nozzle purchased would not shut off completely in one of the two positions in which it is supposed to be off. My ""inexpensive hardware store"" nozzle performs as well or better! One positive feature. however, is the nice rubber case that surrounds the nozzle and protects it from damage when dropped. In summary, I am not completely satisfied and would not purchase the same nozzle again."
2,Short but to the point review...,"I have had two of these nozzles. They start out GREAT but eventually begin leaking. First sign is it just doesn't quite shut off all the way. Eventually, it becomes the annoying type of leak that sprays you in the pants, hands, face, everywhere."
1,Stainless Steel???,"I purchased the ""stainless steel"" version of this nozzle expecting it to have stainless steel parts inside, but it's plastic. Highly disappointed in the overall quality for the price paid. I do not recommend this if you are looking for a high end nozzle."
1,Poorly Made: Read the Other Rewiews,"Advertised as sturdy, firehose strength, powerful and high quality - I'd say not really. My wife bought this for me as a gift from a home show because she knows I like quality and no-nonsense. The sales guy made it sound to her that this thing was engineered to last for life - well life is a about a year or less.1) The internal screw that controls everything is made out of cheap plastic and snapped, rendering the item useless. No way to return it. We were told forever warranty, but now can find nowhere to take it back.2) Another operational drawback is it was a pain in the neck in that you had to rotate the nozzle to turn on and off. This means there is no way to go from off (dry) to on (wet) with out spraying and trickling water all over. In other words, no on/off like a normal spray nozzle. This leads to water waste and getting water sprayed on things that you don't necessarily mean to.Do Not Buy"
1,Bum Aire,This is a bad product. It was expensive and cheaply made. Water pressure with it is terrible. This is the most expensive nozzle I have ever bought and by far the worst. Save your money.
3,hose nozzle,"I wish I had tried both nozzles right away. The second nozzle which I recently tried was difficult to turn, so I purchased the tool to open it. I opened it and oiled the inside but it did not help."
2,I Didn't Like It - Not Good for Washing the Car,"I needed a new sprayer and I wanted to get something well built after going through my third in a few years. It seems well built, but the spray patterns and pressure it can produce are more for watering your garden rather than washing your car or your house. I ended up just getting a nice Craftsman sprayer that I've been happy with and forgetting about this."
5,Great Strong Water Nozzle,I have looked and looked for a nozzle that would last with our water. I have bought many and replaced many... This was the first one that has not disintegrated in just a few months of use. We have what I call high water pressure but the City water district tells us our water flow from the street is normal. However we have gone through more than a dozen nozzle. Anything with plastic lasted about a month. This has lasted 8 months and still working perfectly.
4,High quality,High quality nozzle with a relatively high price. Only wish you could shut of flow while maintaining nozzle setting.
2,"It's okay, I guess.",I would recommend this book for small children. Otherwise you might not be too fond about it. When I say small children I mean ages 6-8.
4,"Man, consciouness and power","I think Timothy Leary gets written off too easily because many of his thoughts and theorems have to do with psychoactive drugs. And yes, he does have the occasional nonsensical, mad moment- but he's experimenting with psychoactive drugs so that's to be expected!. The parts that are lucid are insightful, optimistic(sometimes overly so), and really make one think about the short-sightedness of the current path of man.The one thing I wish he addressed more is the path to change (personal, political, and social) instead of just addressing the mechanics of realizing that we need to change. But other than that it's a very interesting read with a couple of horrid short sci-fiish stories tucked between the better essays.Also the self analyzation of his short conversation with Charles Manson when he was an inmate and his description of the eight circuit brain model are both fascinating."
2,"A few interesting ideas, but laughably poorly written","When I read this as a senior in high school, I thought it was profound and compelling. When I read it again as an adult, having worked for several years as a professional editor, I realized that it was trite and ham-fisted, an obvious vehicle for the author's personal beliefs-not just his philosophical thoughts but his objectivist-libertarian politics as well. If you've ever read B.F. Skinner's ""Walden Two"" and been put off by its heavy-handedness, ""The Soul of Anna Klane"" will elicit the same reaction, only more so. This book does have a few good bits; two of them are excerpted in ""The Mind's I,"" edited by Daniel Dennett and Douglas Hofstadter, which explores a whole range of epistemological topics and is far more suitable for thoughtful readers. At best, this novel qualifies as beach reading for intellectuals. It's too self-important for a sophisticated reader to take seriously."
2,teeth too soft & bendy,Thought it would be good to finish drying front of hair but doesn't hold hair. Gave it to my great-niece for her doll.
1,does not glow in the dark?,"What is the point of this, it doesnt glow in the dark and i 100% can not see a green dot during the daytime either? SO when exactly would i use this?"
4,"Solid, good smut",Once again Clay Caldwell delivers solid good writing. Good 'one-handed' reading- as are most of his titles... Captures the 'feel' and eroticism of wrestling- a nice mix.
4,The Washington Post was right!,I bought this cd based solely on the Washington Post review. This is BEAUTIFUL music--perfect for a lazy sunday afternoon.
1,What a horrid story!,"I got this book out thinking that it would be a story of learning what is really important in life - not who you are related to, but who you ARE.I was greatly disappointed.The book only served to illustrate the unfairness and cruelty of being born in the wrong place and time. The main character, Emily, falls from one tradgedy to another, with no end in sight by the end of the book. Had I read this when I was young (the target audience age) I would have been horribly upset and depressed. I would not suggest this book for ANY child."
2,What's the author's point?,"This is a really depressing book and has a miserable ending. I don't think the main character doesn't need to be hated and punished so much. It seems it's a book you can learn from but I couldn't learn anything from it. Did the author want to show how cruel orphans were treated? Though it was well written, what was the author's point in this book?"
1,Honeywell Filter,I have purchased these filters before and they were a lot thicker than the one I just purchased. In fact you can hold the filter up to the light and see right through it. The quality of the product has changed so I will be buying from another company.
2,Not as expected,"These are not the regular Honeywell brand replacement filters; those came pre-scored and with a template for you to be able to easily cut them to the correct size. The pre-filter is scored like that in the image the seller is using. But what I received is just a solid sheet of the filter material in a plastic bag, and to cut it to fit your filter, you'll get the joy of taking your old, nasty, dirty pre-filter and using THAT as a template to cut this material, while it sheds black dust everywhere.... If you already have respiratory problems, buying a cheap Honeywell knockoff pre-filter shouldn't have to be another one of them."
3,Maybe ok,"I've ordered this filter for several years and this is the first time it didn't look or feel like the HP version. It is twice as thick and many times denser, so much denser you can't see through it. One side was smooth and the other rough. It didn't have the lines to make it easy to cut. The sticker said Honeywell 38002 replacement. I've decided I would give it a try in one of my 1700's. So far no problem. I thought the density might put a strain on the motor and after a few hours it seems ok.I took a chance. Several people have said the same thing about the filter but one reviewer said if it was shipped by amazon it would be correct. I waited until it was Prime and took a chance with no luck.Next time I'm going to pay the extra $5 and get Honeywell's version."
5,Great air purifier,My boyfriend is asthmatic and allergic to many common things. He has become attached to my indoor cat. She is confined to the informal living room and the sun porch. His office is on the sun porch. We set the Honeywell air purifier up out there to help him. The filter actually lasted a good while. I am impressed.
4,Does what it's supposed to.,"Does what it's supposed to, fits and works in style of Honeywell air purifier that most retailers no longer carry prefilters for."
3,Nice filter but....,This is a decent filter - but it has too much of a carbon smell to it. It will take a long use to get that smell to go away. If you leave it in a room for awhile fresh out of the box - the room will have a carbon smell to it - instead of fresh air.
4,Replacement pre-filter.,Filter works fine on my enviracare air cleaner. Easy to use and easy to modify it to fit whatever type of air cleaner you currently use. I'll get another when I need it.
4,enviracare filters,They do exactly what they are supposed to do at a reasonable price. I only wish that they were scored for easy cutting for the different models. The order was delivered in good condition extremely promptly.
5,Works great,This filter works just exactly like the name brand filters. My air cleaners are working just fine with these replacment filters. I tried them because I couldn't find any in the stores near my house. Now I'll get all my replacments online.
1,** Not ** a Honeywell product,Product arrived in a simple ziplock bag with absolutely no Honeywell labels or markings.Filter material is significantly more dense than Honeywell OEM filter.
2,Deceptive Listing - Buyer Beware,"These filters are NOT made by Honeywell. While they may fit Honeywell air cleaners, they are substantially different than the filters made by Honeywell. Note that the genuine 38002 Honeywell filter is labeled as a Enviracare Universal replacement filter. These are some kind of generic filter that can be used in place of those filters. They do not have the perforations and are substantially thicker than genuine Honeywell filters. Because of this thickness, I am concerned that my air cleaner may not be as efficient as with the Honeywell filters. Do not buy if you want the genuine Honeywell filter."
1,Watch out for Imitations. Dont order unless shipped by Amazon,"I have ordered this item from Amazon several times with no issues. This last time I ordered the filter it did not ship from Amazon and I ended up receiving an imitation. Normally I would be ok with this other than the fact that I would have expected fair warning. However, the generic version does not include a perforation which makes cutting the filter much more difficult. I will never purchase this again unless it ships by Amazon."
4,These work better than cheaper generic ones,"I came back to these name branded after trying some cheaper generic carbon filters. The generic filters had inconsistent thickness, and were a pain to cut to size. These come scored so you can just tear them to the right size."
1,"Not ""by Honeywell""","Under the Amazon title are the words ""by Honeywell"". No. What I received was not ""by Honeywell"". It might be just as good. It might even be better. But, it is not ""by Honeywell"". One thing I noticed is the filter does not have the pre-cut lines for easy fitting to my particular air filter. It also seems denser which may make it pass through less air. Nice price, but I would have gone to Home Depot and bought the real thing had I only known the truth. So, be careful ordering from these Amazon merchants."
1,STINKS!!!,I bought this and it made my whole room smell musty! I went out to target and bought another one from the real honeywell company and have not had the same problem.
2,Not as advertised,These came in plan plastic wrapping with no information. Furthermore they are not pre-punched for various filters like the true Honeywell replacements. Not sure who makes these. Just go to Target and get the original filters for a buck or two more.
1,NOT a Honeywell Filter,"This filter is not a Honeywell filter, it's a knock off. I'm not sure how well it will work but it is not a Honeywell branded filter. But it is cheap. You get what you pay for. The listing is misleading."
5,"great product, reliable seller!",amazon is one of the only places that I have been able to consistently find this item..fits both of the filters that I have needed it for in the past. thanks!
3,Be warned.,"The filter works fine, but it is a generic ""one size"" filter that you have to ""cut to size"". I was expecting pre-sized filter, but that is not the case. The plus side is that you have so much left over that you can easily get two filters out of the one giant sheet you get after you cut them to fit. This is assuming you have a reasonably size air filter like I do. I'm sure someone out there has an air filter large enough for the this filter."
5,Honywell Replacement Pre-Filter,The perforations are a nice improvement. The generic prefilters I ordered before were a pain to cut to fit. These make the job easy.
4,Just what I was looking for,"As long as you know that this is one big piece and you have to cut it to size, this is a perfect replacement pre-filter. It was a good price, which is important because this pre-filter is supposed to be replaced often."
3,What you see is not what you get,"The pictured filter has helpful perforations to guide you in cutting the filter to the correct width (like the Honeywell original). However, the filter that was delivered to me lacked any such perforations, which made cutting it more difficult. Otherwise, it seems OK."
4,Replacement Pre-filter for Honeywell,"This item does what it is supposed to. My only criticism is that it is not sized specifically for the filter I have, even though it is the designated replacement item. I have to cut it down to fit and always end up wasting almost half of the material in the package. If they only made it a little bigger, I could get two out of it."
3,Honeywell 50250N,I have purchased this product in the past and recently purchased 2 more. The product has changed. First it does not come in a box like before but comes in just the plastic wrapping. What also has changed is before it came perforated and I would rip down the dotted lines and have my size. Now they recommend that I lay the old dirty one on top of the new one and cut it to size. Why should I contaminate the new one? I lined up one edge around the filter and velcro it in place and cut along the other edge. I recommend saving 1 velcro strip as it only comes with 2 strips now instead of 3 and it needs 3.
4,definitely works,The pre-filter takes most of the dust to keep the HEPA filter clean for longer. Make sure you cut the filter over the sink or outdoors because disturbing it causes carbon dust to fall out and go everywhere.
3,"Much cheaper than buying filters at the store, but I hate having to cut to size","Cutting this to fit your air purifier is a real pain in the !#@, and it gets carbon soot on the surface you cut it on, but it is a lot cheaper."
1,Universal Replacement Difficult to Use,"This was not what I was expecting as this product is not made by Honeywell.The Honeywell Replacement Pre-Filter that you can buy at WAL-MART or Target comes with lines in the filter that make it easy to cut to size for the filter.This product has no lines, so you have to do your best to cut a straight line and make it fit the filter. Not easy.You are better off going to the store and getting the real thing in the Honeywell box, because it costs the same as this generic filter."
1,Not what I expected,"I was really disappointed with this product. I see now that I should have read the description more carefully, but this is NOT the same filter that my Honeywell Hepa filter came with. Pretty unhappy."
2,Not exactly what is pictured in the photo,The image at the top ofthe page shows Honeywell filter boxes and packaging. That is NOT what you will get when you order from this page. You will get a bulk packaged generic filter in a plastic bag with no box. The real Honeywell filter has tear lines in it that make it easy to separate into the proper width for your aur filter unit. This filter is just one big wide and long black sheet that you have to cut to the right size with scissors. This is a real pain after you have had the convenience of the real Honeywell filters. If you don't mind the aggravation then buy from this page. Otherwise I recommend that you look for the legitimate Honeywell product. I will do that the next time I have to buy these types of filters.
1,Honeywell 38002 Enviracare Pre-Filter,"The advertisement says the filter was made by Honeywell, but the filter I received came in a plastic bag and definitely not by Honeywell! This filter is also not as good as Honeywell filter."
1,Not a true Honeywell/Kaz HEPA Pre-Filter,"I'm not giving this product 1 star due to the performance, I'm giving it 1 star because it is not what I ordered. The item I expected was a true Honeywell/Kaz HEPA pre-filter, this is a generic substitute pre-filter. I think it's a little dishonest by the seller, BULKfilter to attach their generic product to this page within Amazon because what they are selling is not what is being advertised.That being said this filter may perform better, may last longer, and may be overall a better product than the original...or it may have harmful chemicals or actually lower the air quality where it is used. That is, unfortunately, the gamble with generic products you don't know what you're getting.To order a true Honeywell/Kaz replacement pre-filter use the new Honeywell part number HRF-AP1.I hope Amazon removes this page since Honeywell no longer sells this item, so unless the sellers have a stockpile of out of production filters you are not buying a Honeywell part."
1,Cheap. You get what you paid for,"This is not made by Honeywell. Which is fine, if the quality is good since the price is. But it is clearly way too thick. It is not pre-cut. I won't buy it again. It feels cheap and now I worry about my motor working extra hard until I get real Honeywell parts to replace them."
4,fits 50250 perfectly,"Your supposed to change your filter every 3 months. I have a dog and he gets fur on everything, and my filters always have a ton of fur on them. I sometimes try to vacuum the filter to get longer use out of it, but it absorbs odors too so if you want a clean fresh room everytime, do yourself a favor and change it. After using a Honeywell filter, my allergies have lessened. The stuff really works, but you have make sure it is working efficiently by cleaning it and changing filters.This universal filter fits the round 50250 model perfectly. You just have to cut a few inches off, and each box just gives you enough for one use. No point in having an air purifier if you don't change the filter."
3,Serviceable,This filter is much thinner material thn the original extra filters I purchased years ago with the Enviracare 350. I had to cut it down to fit as it was too wide and had to be careful when doing so as the material seems vulnerable to tears.
5,It really works!!!!!!,"This little filter really traps a lot of dirt. The light went on for me to replace it, and when I removed the filter there was more cat hair on it than on my cat. There was a tremendous amount of dust in the filter too. I really didn't think my house was so dusty."
1,This pre-filter smells awful,"My Hepa filter was great when I first purchased it. It made the air smell clean, but more importantly, it reduced my allergies to household dust.However, it has not been the same since I replaced the filter it came with, and put this pre-filter on it. This pre-filter smells really horrible. It makes me feel sick. I can't even describe the smell exactly. My husband thought it smelled like chemicals, but I thought it smelled like rotting meat. So, needless to say, I haven't been using my Hepa filter lately.I'm going to have to research other filter options."
5,good,"I bought this filter for my honeywell enviracare 50101 but they were too big, so i ended up cutting it into small sections that fit and everything worked out for the better cause i ended up with extra filters that i can use. they work fine just like the original carbon filters that come with the enviracare."
5,good stuff!!!,I buy this product continuesly from a couple years ago. they good for the price we paid. I will continue purchase them in the future.
4,these work just fine,"These came in a generic black sealed bag of 3. As others have noted, they do not appear to be Honeywell brand filters, but they do the job and are cheap, so I can't complain."
1,"Not Honeywell, poor quality","The filter comes as one giant filter and needs to be cut to fit your filter. Be prepared for a mess of fine charcoal dust when cutting. Extremely disappointed with the quality, the need to cut and the misleading item description. I would have been better off just washing my old filter."
3,Everything Is Well Except One Thing,"The Universal replacement did not come with any way to easily divide the filter for different size units. But if you are careful, you can cut it with a pair of scissors. Be careful, use the guide that is included...and be absolutely sure that you mark both ends of the filter and the middle with chalk or tailor's chalk so that you can cut it straight and proper. The material is as good or better than original quality."
3,A Little Letdown,"This filter used to come in perforated rolls, designed to fit in my Honeywell air purifier. When it arrived in broad, folded, sheets, I thought I had been sent the wrong item. I called the vendor [Allergy Asthma Tech?] and the rep on the phone informed me that the pre-fitted filters were no longer being made; he was quite nice about the whole thing.So, delivery and service was great - but now having to cut strips of filter when replacing is a bit of a drag."
5,Does what it is supposed to.,I had been purchasing this item in stores but have been having trouble finding them recently. I received the actual Honeywell enviracaire brand pre-filter no. 38002 (not an off-brand substitute). Thanks Amazon!
1,Awful Filter - Don't waste your money,"Don't waste you money on this poor excuse for a filter. It doesn't fit without cutting, and does not filter anything. You'd get better filtering from the bag it was packed in.It's so bad, I wish I could give it no stars.Stick with a name brand filter and save yourself some grief and breath better."
1,Don't buy Honeywell air products,"I ordered pre-filters for my Honeywell model 50100 air cleaner. What I received was one sheet of pre-filter material. The original pre-filters had scored marks so you could see where to cut. There were no cutting or cross-hatch lines either like all wall papers have. The instructions said that I had to measure and cut my own filters out of this bulk piece. When I did cut the material, it shred at the cut points. The original material did not shred. I suspect that we have an inferior product along with a lack of customer consideration.It's unfortunate that the Honeywell name is being purchased by Kaz, Inc. to market this product for them. I don't think that it's a product that Honeywell itself would produce."
2,Misleading...,"I won't be buying from this seller again.. Long strips of product that had to be cut to size (no perforations for standard machine sizes) and the product (I bought two) arrived in a ziplock plastic bag with no labeling, no nada, except the packing list. This is not reassuring when it comes to product quality or safety of use!"
2,Not what I expected as a Honeywell pre-filter,When I bought Honeywell filters in the past they came in a box marked with the brand name and they had pre-marked cutting lines to fit multiple air cleaners. These came in a plastic bag with no written instructions or other material and are simply strips of pre-filter material with no marking so you can't follow a line with scissors easily.I will have to measure and cut these to fit and it will be more difficult without the pre-marked lines. Fortunately I still have a paper pattern from the old box of filters which can be used for cutting these to fit.
2,"Difficult to prepare, but does the job","I have been using Honeywell air filtration units for several years, and I've found it's wise to change the pre-filters regularly. But I'm sick and tired of cutting the pre-filters to fit the HEPA filter of my air-cleaning machine. It's difficult to see the perforations where the cuts must be made. And for me, making the cuts is arduous.I don't understand why Honeywell doesn't offer pre-filters that are cut to fit each machine. I guess the filters work just fine, but they seem expensive for what I'm receiving, especially considering that I'm required to do a great deal of work to make the pre-filters ready for use.The pre-filters are NOT worth 12 dollars (or whatever), but I would be happier to pay that sum if the filters were pre-cut."
1,don't buy this product,"it came wrapped in plastic but when I opened it, it got tiny black grainy particles everywhere. Was it supposed to be like that? I won't buy it again. It really made a big mess."
1,HEPA User,"The ""Universal Replacement Pre-Filter' was too large and bulky and did not fit. In accurately and incorrectly presented this product. Would not recommend this vendor. Will seek a different vendor to supply a Pre-Filter that correctly fits the Honeywell unit."
1,TOO SMALL for 52250 Model!!!!,I needed a prefilter for my 52250 Honeywell Airfilter and put the model # into the search engine here at Amazon. This came up. ITS WAY TOO SMALL. AVOID this if you have a full height airfilter unit.
2,"Sure, it fits all Honeywell Circular Models...If you have a pair of scissors","This is just bollocks claiming it ""fits"" all Honeywell circular air purifiers. I own the Honeywell 17000 Permanent Pure HEPA QuietCare Air Purifier, purchased from this site, and this filter is about 2 inches two wide to fit it, I had to cut a strip of filter off just to be able to use it in my purifier. Look for a more specific filter, is my recommendation."
4,Replacement filter,"I'd prefer a correct-size filter, like the one that comes with the air-cleaner when new, rather than having to use scissors to cut this product to size, but it does the job."
5,Prefilter,This is activated charcoal filter which is a pre filter for a Honewell hepa filter. This material works to save hepa filter plus take smells and other small particals from air prior to recirculation. They work as discribed.
3,"Not Exactly ""Universal""","I bought this filter replacement for my ""Honeywell 50100 Enviracaire Air Purifier."" The filter came with scored lines and directions for cutting for each model, but they didn't work my air purifier, so I had to cut them myself, which was annoying since the filters are difficult to cut through."
5,Perfect for the Thanksgiving trip car ride,"My daughter enjoyed this book during the trip to grandma's, which is 6 hours away, for Thanksgiving. I wish I had gotten it earlier in the month, because she just really loved looking at the pictures and talking about it. Next year!"
3,decent little thriller,This review is for the Amazon VOD rental of this film. This film is excellent forthe first ninety minutes or so and then it kind of peters out for me. A killer hiredto off a woman falls in love with her instead. All the actors are very good. AnthonyLaPaglia is a fine actor and Mimi Rodgers is one beautiful woman. Peter Boyle adds alot with his role. This film is well worth the $2.99 rental price but I think the lasthalf hour keeps a good film from very a great film.
2,very predictable and stupid,This must be one of the most predictable and stupid movies I have seen in my entire life!
5,Get your glam on!!!,"Disco+Rock+Techno+Glam = DEAD OR ALIVE!!! That's right, the boys are back with a wicked collection of >NEW< tracks as well as some killer remakes of their classics. Following in the footsteps of their amazing NUKLEOPATRA, Dead Or Alive once again prove their ability to evolve and grow in their craft, yet still manage to set the dance floor on fire!"
4,In a FRAGILE state.,"I've been a deadicated fan of DOA since '85. I purchased this album 4 days after it's release from Japan. The only remake I LOVE is ""Lover Come Back To Me"". I was so disappointed with the remake of ""Something In My House"" because it left out the #1 catchy lyric in the song: ""I I IIIII"". I think that one lyric is the most powerful aspect of ""Something In My House"". Call me picky? NOT! ""I Paralyze"" in my opinion, is the best song featured on the Fragile album. Did anybody notice the harmony off ""Hit And Run Lover""? I recognized it from ""Brand New Lover""! In a way, DOA did remake ""Brand New Lover"" by introducing ""Hit And Run Lover""....listen to the melody and the smoothness of the song.....AWESOME! I expect DOA to come out with their follow up to Fragile very soon. Pete....hope you're feeling better now, healthwise.....you're gonna need all the energy for us die-hard Fans! LOVE, JERRY nukleopatra@safelink.net"
2,"This is okay, another re-mix of a re-mix","This is okay at best. I am really tired of great 12"" mixes from the 80's re-mixed with a ""new computer"" and saying ""oh boy, another great re-mix"", my OPINION is release this with the ORIGINAL 12"" mixes and you would have a great CD.This reminds me of the ""The Original Artists"" who would record for K-Tel, Ron-Co and (Ronco) so on then sell 19 hits for [$$].Before any of you REAL DJ's jump down my throat, tell me could you not have done this better?"
3,it's catchy ! & energetic !!!,"after hearing the Entire ""fragile album"" (by D.O.A.) I am pleased, with what they have accomplished on this album. there are some very ""catchy songs"" (like for instant) (""I PARALYZE"") 'a""great danceable energetic hipnotic song"". another great song is (""I PROMISED MYSELF"") it will simply bring tears to your eyes! ""a great classic"" (D.O.A.) LOVE SONG! (and much to my surprise!), I love what they did to ""BLUE CHRISTMAS"" (it's simply a ""beautiful song"" D.O.A. has ever did! (all in all) ""FRAGILE"" is in deed, a good album. with some very good songs, (although,) the old classic songs they did on the album, is another story. the rest of the album should have never been made. (really terrible ""remakes"" of there old stuff. ""very disappointed"") I hope they release a new album soon with all new material. but until then, I'll be dancing to ""FRAGILE"" over and over again..."
4,FAB,"Not flawless though. Hit and Run lover sounds like their old stuff, in a good pop-o-rama way. Instant hit. U2's ""Even Better Than the Real Thing"" is fun and high energy (better than U2's Real Thing). ""I Paralyze"" features his growling vocals at their best with some PHAT analogue synth sounds you never heard before. Amazing. Even to a jaded club goer like me. ""Isn't It A Pity"" is hallarious. Pete's deep, manly voice whines about what its like ""not being the prettiest girl in the world"" to a funky Kraftwerk beat, robot vocoder included. Some of the 2000 remixes are dreadful. Especially ""Turn Around And Count To Ten"". Yikes. ""Lover Come Back To Me"" is easier to cope with. ""I Promise Myself"" sound much of a cheez-fest as well. Like Captain Hollywood Project or LaBouche hijacked our beloved Pete, held a gun to his head and forced him to belt out this crap.Included in sleeve is ""our king of the she-male race"" flawless in Westwood. ""Belts, boots, up to his thighs, thick mascara all around his eyes!"""
2,B-O-R-I-N-G !!,"This is probably the most boring exercise DVD I ever tried to do. There is no music, just some ""drum beat"" type noise. Also, there is no background stage, color, picture or anything. It's just Charlene with 2 others, with a white background. The group looks like they are ""floating"" in air..almost made me dizzy to watch it.There was no real pattern..just repeating an exercise 3 times or so then moving on to a new one.I gave it 2 stars because I respect Charlene's ability as an instructor..older DVD's I have seen of her were better than this one."
5,RED HOT HISTORICAL!!,"This is truly romantic erotica! It's so hard to find this sub-genre in historical form. If you are looking for really erotic love story, with lots of red hot love scenes between ONLY the hero and heroine, this is it!Although no longer available here, you can still get it from the author's website.Let's hope some smart publisher like Brava or Kensington picks up this author (Nina Bruhns writing as Nikita Black.) for print. This would be a sure bet for an erotic anthology!!"
4,"Hot, hot, hot",He does not give up. He goes after her again and again. Great.I really liked that.And a very nice ending.Loads of hot sex.
5,Spicy!,"Wow! I can honestly say this was the finest romance erotica I have ever read! The metaphorical thunder and lightning created when these two characters meet is truly awesome. The dialogue was expertly written and entirely believable for both the Indian and the white woman. Was it ""historically accurate""? No. Would this have really happened? Nope. Who cares!! This is a fun, hot, sensual read! I surely enjoyed it! I even loved the cover art. I only hope Nikita Black will continue writing more Native American romance like this."
4,hot hot,"oh boy, to be back in the day of cowboys and indians. *whew* Well, the story is one that can read in a couple of hours, but hey, the price is right. and you get a HEA.. and some hot loving in that time. what more can you ask for?"
2,Story Fell Flat,"I read the book, but didn't really like it. There were lots of assumptions and leaps that needed to help the story move forward. I was really dissappointed."
2,Tame,"I found this erotic historical western novella to be tame and tepid. I've read other books by the author and the chemistry between the leading characters fairly sizzled, but with this book it fairly fizzled. Perhaps because it was so short at 66% on kindle. There obviously couldn't be enough time for character development.There were some cringeworthy lines between Sally and Standing Bear. In one scene after he has taken her viginity, Standing Bear says ""Come with me,"" he urged his voice rough with passion. ""Hear the thunder"" I suppose this novella reminded me of the older Mills and Boon stories, completely over the top."
4,"The Renegade's Woman doesn't make the ""keeper shelf""...","But it's an enjoyable read. This is Nikita Black's first book & the only mistake I saw was a common one with newbies: an abundance of ""purple prose"". She's trimmed that tendency in her later books, which is a big plus in selling. The author impressed me with the Native American details she attached to the storyline, and a plot that worked in such a quick read.I like what's happening within the romance genre, pushing the boundaries of erotica. More publishers need to take note that if you don't offer the readers a varied reading list, they can get bored. I want books to surprise me & keep me reading until the book is finished. This author does just that & Nikita Black's on my ""must read"" list no matter what format she's printed in, or what name she uses."
4,Very enjoyable SACD,"I have to start by saying I don't quite know how they've done this series. My guess is they have gotten hold of old mono tape masters and developed software created stereo and multichannel DSD masters. Part of me says ""these are not true audiophile disks"" BUT I really enjoy listening to them. They do sound very good and the material selections are excellent. Some of the recordings work better than others for the multi-channel creations. I tend to think they overdid the echo/reverb a bit in the back channels. Bottom line is for me though that I have now bought six in this series of SACD's and I'm glad I have all of them.BTW, there's some very sweet music on this Benny Goodman disk."
1,Biased account that substitutes sympathy for thought,"The book gives short shrift to the many studies (Harvard, Mayo Clinic, Holland), etc.) that show that women with implants do not suffer from the diseases in question at a rate any higher than those without them. Instead she talks with the women who have these conditions (lupus, auto-immune, etc.) and allows her sympathy for them to cancel out the statistics. Although she cites some obscure newspaper articles on the issue, she nowhere cites the NY Times' Gina Kolata because of the latter's extensive unbiased reporting of the lack of evidence associating implants with these conditions."
1,junk science by any name is junk,A terribly innacurate review of the scientific literture is portrayed in this book to conclude there was ever any systemic illness associated with silicone implants. Dozens of large studies have made this book look progressively less accurate
3,Black thai Rice,"The three packages of rice were shipped in a timely manner. My only problem is that it arrived with a moth infestation in one of the bags and I had to throw it out. Frankly, that happened the last time I oredered black sticky rice from the Temple of Thai and I will not order from them again."
3,Purple Sticky Rice?,"Purple Sticky Rice.. exotic looking.. doesn't taste purple..has a nice ""nutty"" aroma while cooking and a similar taste. Good healthy, cheap, way to impress your guests."
2,it may be the real deal and not colored purple rice but...,It is far too expensive for that. It is very tasty but wow... It is also very beautiful but there has to be more then that.
1,Outrageous shipping,I ordered 12 of these nut because of the price and this was one part of a six part order. Therefore I didn't notice the breakdown of the shipping for the entire order. When I got the order confirmation e-mail with the full breakdown....these 12 nuts totaling $1.68 had shipping of $63! I have sent an e-mail canceling the item...no response yet. Will see.
1,I should have listened to other reviewers . . .,"I puchased this product more on hope than hearsay. And I was wrong. While the basic concept seems like it would work (and with a few design changes it probably would), the ""comfort factor"" was a letdown and as a result the product is not wearable. While the velcro strap does indeed stretch the plantar fascia, it does so at the very uncomfortable expense of cramping the toes. After 10 or 15 minutes, I had to remove the FXT. I definitely could not sleep in it. Also, as others have stated, it has no breathability and your foot sweats while wearing. In summary, look elsewhere for a night-splint type product to stretch out your plantar fascia ligaments."
1,fxt night splint,"Splint pulls up on the toes only. Needs more support on the bottom, or sole of the splint. Spend a little more money and get the splint that supports from the underside."
1,Too tight in the toes,"This product pulls your toes together so much so that I had to take it off half way through the first night. Of course, they don't accept returns, so it was a total loss."
3,Not much stretch,"A great idea, but just didn't work for me. #1-I did not get much stretch from it. The picture shows the toe really stretch, but since its made out of soft material, I got hardly any stretch from it. #2-I tend to flip in several positions during sleep (back, side and stomach), so it was extemely uncomfortable when I was sleeping on my stomach and I ended up taking it off. It works ok when I'm watching TV or relaxing reading a book, but not so great for sleeping - at least not for moi."
3,"Very uncomfortable for ME, not worth the money,but......","I found that after about an hour or two of wear, my toes were cramping so badly that I had to take it off. I tried it for several nights with the same results. It never got any better. :( On the other side, I have a friend who got this one (we ordered it at the same time) and ABSOLUTELY LOVES IT! She hasn't had any toe cramping and it has made her pain go away after only a week of wear!"
3,"Ok, but not as good as stretching.","While this does provide a very basic level of stretching by putting the foot into a neutral position, it is not as good as stretching as soon as you open your eyes in the morning (before stepping on your foot). I used for 2 weeks but saw better relief from focused stretching (which is possible by using the belt from a bathrobe looped around your big toe and you pulling your entire foot backwards)."
3,yes and no,"I tried it the first night, seemed to help (my plantar fasciitus) a bit. The second night is was so uncomfortable that I pulled it off during the night. I have tried 3 podiatrists, 1 acupuncturist, P/T, Cortisone shots, orthotics, exercises, icing, heat, wraps and purchased various devices. The best thing that worked was stretching a few minutes before I got out of bed and always wearing orthotics (never going barefoot, even in the house). I am trying to find slippers that will hold my orthotics, may try Birkenstocks, for in the house. They have a line called Arizona with a higher arch."
1,not for me,"This brace is not for me for a couple of reasons - the toe area was too tight and it did not provide a good stretch. It did not provide the proper stretch for my foot because I could not make the strap that goes around your ankle tight enough to keep my foot fairly straight as shown in the photo. If you don't mind squeezing your toes, and your ankle, you might get some good from this. It looks like a really good idea but just didn't work for me."
1,Little benefit,This product won't do much for a woman wearing size 8 or smaller shoe sizes. The smallest size didn't work for my problem. The sole needs an inner support to pull your toes toward the front of your leg.
1,Hurts my toes,I bought this night splint hoping for relief. I tried it several nights and adjusted the tension each night. Every time my toes fell asleep and were in pain because of the way the splint pulls up on them. Get a splint that pulls from the ball of the foot and save your toes!
2,bad comfort good results,"The product did relieve my heel pain quite well. However the design of the ""boot"" squeezes your toes together when the strap is tightened and also squeezes down on your big toe. Both cause quite a bit of discomfort. I have tried a few of the ""soft"" splints with the same results. But, product is very portable, I just end up waking up in pain and ripping it off. If you can keep it on it should help."
3,Its ok....,does not really work that well at night for me - it tends to cause pain as it rubs on my big toe. i can't really wear it all through the night. it will wake me up. i have used it some in the day - it has tended to work a bit better then.
4,Less Pain--Yes; Healed--not quite,"This product is widely availabe on the web, but this was certainly the best price for the item. Its results depend on how conscientious I am as a user--and how well I adhere to other recommendations like arch supports and exercise."
1,NOT recommended for Plantar Fasciitis!!!!,After being recently diagnosed with Plantar Fasciitis i ordered this night splint. I tried it for two weeks with no relief yet. And the placement of the velcro strap only pulls at your toes making it truly uncomfortable. Once i brought it to my physical therapist i found that it is NOT effective for Plantar Fasciitis. This product is NOT worth the money!!!! Now im stuck with it and have to purchase another one. TRULY UNHAPPY WITH THIS PRODUCT!!!!!
2,"Cute, But...... Where's the dragon?","I purchased this phone from Amazon. Unfortunately, the Amoi DA6 I received did not have the dragon motif as pictured. The front was plain silver bordered in blue (beware). I specifically purchased this phone because of the dragon motif. That was my first disappointment, regretably there were more to come. Most of the menu options are in Chinese and the battery life is extremely poor. I charged the phone overnight and the battery would still be exhausted by the end of the day. If I forgot to charge it overnight the battery would be dead in the morning. The phone is not compatible with any service I know of, for downloading ringers and screensavers. The ringers/images pre-installed on the phone are awful and quite annnoying. The phone's overall design is quite outdated which gives it a retro look. The phone is cute but definitely not worth the price compared to other phones being offered on today's market."
5,"Celebrate you, the arts & success in the middle school class","Have you ever tried to teach a classroom of 30 or more 8th graders of varying abilities to read and focus? Try it, and I recommend this book in your classroom, also a textbook called African American Literature (Holt, Rinehart, & Winston), lyrics to new popular songs and golden oldies... etc.Back to the book, VERY much fun. Has poetry by Langston Hughes, Gwendolyn Brooks, etc. A plethora of unique artwork! Interesting biographical notes in the back of the famous African Americans referred to in the book such as James Baldwin, Lucille Clifton, and Jimi Hendrix."
5,"A lively, festive production that deserves to be on DVD!","This production of ""Little Lord Fauntleroy"" is a pure joy to watch. It is much better than the Freddy Bartholomew production and more fun to watch than the BBC miniseries. Unfortunately, the movie has not been updated to DVD which is a shame since new generations will be stuck with watching the less well-done movies."
5,Little Lord Fauntleroy,"Agree, Lets get it on DVD man!!!!!!!!! waht is up with all of you get it out there"
5,ON OF THE BEST CHRISTMAS MOVIES EVER !,This is the movie we put away after every Christmas and watch it again the year after ! It gives us such a warm feeling every year !Alec Guinness is our favourite actor and he plays grandfatherjust perfect.
4,Great Xmas Movie,"This movie has become a Xmas tradition around our house. The cinematography is superb, as is the casting. I always end up reaching for the Kleenex box before the end! I would really like it in DVD since my VHS copy is wearing out."
5,It was a gift for my dad,My dad loves old classic movies and so do I that is why I brought this movie for him for Christmas. Hey what can I say the old man simply loves it!
1,Little Lord Fauntleroy,The DVD is in Italian! I could only send it to a friend who lives in Italy. Would like to see this great movie in DVD in English.
3,Nice shirt but I recieved a different color than pictured.,"It is a very nice T-shirt for the Price. The shipping from Fan Edges was handled very well. My only disappointment with the order is that the shirt pictured above has RED cuffs & neck bands. What was shipped (size large) was BLUE cuffs and neck bands. No option of selecting color of bands and NO mention of a possiblity of alternate color bands shipping. I suggest contacting Fans Edge to confirm color before ordering, especially if you are set on receiving RED bands."
5,A delight to experience.,"I'm not a chintz collector - in fact never heard the term before the book. So what captivated me about this book? Quite apart from its literary worth, Shelley Chintz is quite simply the most physically and esthetically appealing book I ever experienced. The smell of it, the feel of the paper and the impeccable quality of its reproductions. Then there was indeed the content of the book, nicely organized, meticulously researched and reflective of no small amount of detective work - all presented in a writing style embued with the passion the author feels for her subject. Am I going to become a chintz collector? Not likely. But Kelly must feel a great deal of satisfaction in authoring what I suspect is a definitive treatment of this topic. How many of us can say that!!"
4,Good quality mess kit,"This mess kit just arrived today, so when I finally get to use it, this review will be updated.The construction appears to be solid and of decent quality. For some reason I overlooked ""copper bottom"" on the stainless steel fry pan, even though it is plainly listed in the description. The entire kit bundles nicely into a 7.5x3 inch package (see customer provided pictures at top of page to see unit packed up) to take up minimal space in your backpack."
1,Not what I expected,"It was ok, not exactly worth the money. It will now remain in a box until I get tired of looking at it and throw it out..."
2,Flimsy,"Stainless material is such light guage metal that the top colapses down into the bottom with only light compression. Not nearly as rigid or well made as my old aluminum Boy Scout mess kit. It would be a decent product with heavier metal. Knowing what I now know, I would not purchase it."
4,Good buy,"I bought two of these for my husband's and my 72-hour emergency kits, so I wanted something small and of good quality. I trust Texsport and I much prefer stainless steel to aluminum. My only complaint would be that the folding handle that folds to keep everything together does not clamp on very tightly."
3,This was not the product for me.,"Not a durable product for grown-ups. This is probably better used as a toy. I made the mistake of going cheap and should have got something more suitable/durable for open fire cooking. This is not the products fault, I read the discription and reviews but still wanted to keep it low budget...I wasted a few dollars but relearned a vaulable lesson-you get what you pay for!"
2,Call Me Tipsy,"Would have given this kit at least one more star if it had a handle that was usable and not prone to dump hot stuff on you or the ground. There has got to be an ""engineer"" who could put something like that together so it wouldn't be an accident that happens more often than not. (how about a set of ""grippers"" to hold the pan handle in place when it's open for use?) I've been practicing, but so far have not come up with a solution other than using a hot pad to steady the pan.Compact and light weight? Yes. Measuring lines on cup? Yes.As is, should be labeled: Use At Your Own Risk. Your Dog Will Love It."
4,"Great kit, if you know how to use it...","This is a great little kit to have in your backback. For under $15 I don't know what the people who gave it bad reviews were expecting, but I was impressed. If the latch fit tighter I would have given it 5 stars, but since I had to insert a folded piece of paper towel under the handle to make it secure, I only gave it 4. It serves the purpose I was buying it for (backpacking for 2 ppl)very well. Hint to guy burning his pancakes; when cooking over camp fires, remember the fire is MUCH hotter than a burner on your stove. A smarter person would find a flat rock free of moisture to put at the edge of your campfire, allow the fire to heat the rock, then set the skillet on the rock as you would a burner on your stove. Happy trails to you all..."
2,Did I use it wrong?,"With all the great reviews for this mess kit, I was pretty disappointed when I tried to use it on a camping trip. When I put the pan on my little Coleman stove, it almost immediately got all burnt-looking and deformed, and would just burn the outer part of whatever food I put on it (and barely heat the food), and this was on the stove's lowest possible setting without the flame going out. It did this even when I put aluminum foil over the pan. The pot worked fine for making soup and hot water. I'm not sure if I should have done something differently, or if I just got a weird pan."
3,Texsport Stainless Steel Mess Kit,"This is an inexpensive compact cooking tool set for one person; metal sauce pan with handle, metal bowl with handle, metal dish, and plastic cup. This would serve me for this trip. I do not expect it to last for years. But it is indeed compact. I will see how functional it would be."
4,nice mess set,this mess set seems to be solid i will put it to the test come spring and for the price you cant beat it
2,"Cheap, obviously","Not what I thought it would be, which says a lot, because I didn't expect it to be much but a cheap mess kit. The lid/plate doesn't seat itself in the pan and even if it did, the handle doesn't stay locked and there's almost a half inch gap between it and the lid. Don't buy it unless you really don't care about quality at all or you just don't have the money to spend on something else."
1,stainless mess kit,"Hey...do you remember the mess kits we had in the Army...well, this isn't one of them.I should know better...although beautifully miniaturized, it is extremely small...plan on cooking one egg at a time on that open fire...ha' ha...I'm laughing although whoever I bought this from is laughing much harder...$13 for an extremely small mess kit."
1,Had hopes for this product,"Honestly I believe in the underdog but this product let me down. I read the reviews and chose to ignore them... I wished I'd have listened. I kinda thought that maybe the bad reviews were from people that prefer to pay $$$ for backpacking supplies that the ""experienced"" hiker buys. Well truth be told this set is cheap! Even for the price this thing is CHEAP! The large frying pans handle/latch that is supposed to hold the hold kit together when assembled doesn't! It's way to loose! I thought about sending it back but figure I'll give it to my friends for their kids to play with... it's THAT bad. I am still shopping around for a decent set of stainless steel pans for backpacking. As always amazon shipping was reliable and quick! But I can not recommend this set of pans."
1,Texsport Stainless Steel Mess Kit,the product it horrible and cheap the handle bent on me the first time i opened it. the coleman is cheaper price and better quality. i regret getting this and i would hope they read this and refund me the money . as for the product i threw half of it in the trash the bowl part i gave it to my dog so he can eat out of it when i take him hiking. otherwise this was a bad investment
2,heidegger--Metaphysics,Much to complicated for the average reader--and multiple redundant statements and aphorisms that make the book as totally boring.Ron
1,"Nativity, The life of JesusChrist (in Spanish)","This is a low budget movie advertized asNativity: The Life of Jesus Christ (Spanish)(?) in Spanish, but the only Spanish contents are the titles at the begining and the credits for the music.Then, all dialogs are in English with no subtitles in any Spanish.The voices have been doubed in studio by non professional actors and with no care for the acoustics. A character could be distant but will sound up-front, too close to sound convincing and natural.Some ""poetic licences"" : angel Gabriel is a female character (?)Does not follow narrations from the gospels. Pitiful movie. A waste of money and time by the producers"
2,Will not recommend,"I am Indian and could not agree with Lukas Jackson's comments more. I would only like to add one other comment though. I personally do not believe in any organized religion and would love to hear an objective criticism of Hinduism and Islam. But this book did not do anything for me. In fact, what bothers me the most is Naipaul's language. It is very condescending and imperialistic. I would not recommend this book to anyone."
3,V.S. Naipaul: A Wounded Indian Heart,"For me, this book was more about Naipaul himself than India. His effort, intellectual labour, disappointment, pain, anger, all reflects how much he cared about India - a country he is connected by only ancestral relation.His descriptions and observations, though negative as usual, are correct. His detest for dark skin, smaller bodies, poverty and dirt - which he never fails to notice - is visible.Main problem is his judgments and generalizations made from few pieces of knowledge and visits. A civilization too heterogeneous and too big to judge from a slice of a time or glances at few locations. Another issue is his value system with which he wants to evaluate everyone else. People are not same everywhere and their aspirations, priorities, and point of views are also not the same. A writer of his stature should have given consideration to the fact."
4,On the dot!,"As an expat, and with a broader perspective than the usual cocooned Indian, I very much agree with Mr. Naipaul.India is a sick civilation, surviving much like the common roach through thick and thin, though to questionable purpose.Can be called a parasitic civilization, evolution gone wrong, peopled by psychoses.With as much of an inviting lifestyle as Pond-Scumia.I suggest an objective reading of the book (with a good dose of self-psychology)- especially if you think India is a ""great country""."
1,A book written don't know why.,"A complete crap.I had not read any book in my life like this. First of all, the writing is completely unstructured. All the opinions are formed based on a limited communication with set of people. The author frequently takes reference from some old books as well as old drama which any indian would have hardly heard of and morever, the intention of the book seems to be spreading abuse and improper image of indian civilization. A few facts are interesting but difficult to digest in such a way of writing.I strongly discourage people to read this book and form any impression about india present or past."
2,Well-written but unsatisfying,"For those who want an introduction to India's politics and culture, look elsewhere. V.S. Naipaul writes beautifully --- every sentence is carefully crafted --- but his impressions do not amount to much. While I read, my head was filled with one vivid image after another. I assume this accurately reflects the complexity of India. But by the time I was halfway through, I was lost. What's he trying to say? What's really happening in India? The final third mentions Gandhi (and his complex legacy) on nearly every page, but little of what Naipaul has to say taught me anything. Although this book was a pleasure to read, I'm afraid I can't recommend it. It's simply too scattered and unfocused."
1,Fish all right!,"I believe that this film should actually be called ""SUCKER"". Jeez, I'm glad I didn't buy it. The hype was very good! Too bad the film was not. If by now people don't realize meeting people by way of the internet is a ""crap shoot"" than the are really naive."
4,Catfish make life interesting?,"I really liked this movie. It accurately portrayed both sides of the story in an very interesting way and it really keeps the viewer guessing. Also this movie really feels really genuine so I disagree with the reports that this is just acting, this definitely is a documentary, just an interesting one. But does it makes me question what Nev did after the film.However I do agree that the trailer was extremely misleading. While there is an amount of suspense, it's nothing like an alfred hitchcock film and shouldn't be compared to his films at all. This is just a story of a person falling in love with the ideal and then finding out that this love is all just a made up story.Definitely worth a quick rent for some deep thought on the digital age and how good some people are at lying."
3,Not that great...,"i mean, it wasnt BAD but i've seen much better... idk, i guess it's just a personal opinion... i dont like the show either... i guess if you love the show, you'd love this.."
2,meh,it is what it is. not bad but not great. but now i know what facebook is and how to avoid being played
5,This was a great purchase,This was a great purchase. We were very satisfied and would recommend this vendor to others. The experience was positive.
2,A let down,"This film was promoted as ""A riveting suspense thriller with a jaw-dropping twist"" but I found it to be neither riveting nor suspenseful, with a `twist' that fell flat. I kept waiting for it to get interesting, then it ended."
5,Great Movie,"It is an interesting look at why people misrepresent themselves on the Internet. I think that the film is also done in a merciful manner towards people who could have easily been lambasted and ridiculed. It was very entertaining and although you knew what the outcome would inevitably be, it was interesting to watch the characters develop through the course of the movie."
3,Internet Fantasies,Interesting Documentary because of the Notre Dame fiasco. I am running into variations on people matching websites. You just have to get too the realities before you get to involved. Do people checks and phone number checks to see if they make sense.
1,Terrible waste of time,"A sad movie with sad protagonists that run into a sad character. The ""twist"" is predictable, slow and leaves you with disappointed feeling."
4,Interesting,"Heard about this movie; thought it was interesting but some parts were boring. Good plot, worth watching especially with teenage kids."
4,"Well done, and it could have gone the other way...","Bravo to the filmmakers for taking a thoughtful route on this documentary. Could have been very exploitive but ended up being very touching and sensitive. I enjoyed this so much more than I thought I would. I was expecting something horribly awkward, but by the end, my friends and I were so happy we watched it. Thank you to the filmmakers for taking the time to do this right, and do it so well."
4,Way better than I expected,"Because of all the hype surrounding this film, I was anticipating a disappointment. I was wrong.Produced and edited very well, the film was engaging and entertaining. I have a lot of respect for Nev Schulman for handling the final discovery with sensitivity. Even though I knew what this film was about, thanks to the current MTV TV Show based on the same, I was still surprised at the results. I definitely recommend this movie. It's an easy watch, and even though I do not love shaky camera documentaries, it went by quickly and I found myself wanting more. Enjoy!"
2,Did not like,Not my kind of a movie. Would not recommend.thought movie was very boring! Not a lot of action and was boring.
3,These guys can't be that dumb.,These Guys can't be that dumb. A review in haiku.I don't think it's nicewhen we make fun of people;this movie seems fake.
2,No thanks,"I enjoy the tv show, so thought I'd watch the movie. The movie leaves you feeling depressed. As far the movie being labeled as suspense and thriller, ummm no. The show is 10 times better than this crock."
3,catfish the movie,"love the tv show, wanted to see the documentary...was soso. should have told more about angela and the whole story involved. didn't make much sense."
2,Catfish ugh,"Catfish was not the jaw dropping movie that I expected. The description reeled me in, but it was less than what I was hoping for."
4,You Never Know Who Your Chatting With,"""Catfish"" is a disturbing, sad tale of a schmuck who is sucked into an internet romance. Though there is little suspense here, you do feel sorry for Yaniv (the before-mentioned schmuck) and more so for Angela, his Facebook friend in Michigan."
4,It is suspenseful,"I heard good and bad things about this movie but all in all I would say it is good and is suspenseful, if you can believe it. You immediately start trying to figure out what could be wrong in this scenario but I think it did proved a little twist and something that wasn't my first guess. I would recommend this movie."
3,Asks A Lot,"This movie is basically good. The character development is slow and at times I got somewhat bored with some of the details of each character's personality. We are asked to get into the minds of the characters to go along with what is possibly a common occurrence, internet lying on chat sites. In this case on a grand scale. However, as the movie slowly unravels we can get lost in a not so dynamic story before we get to the action which is for us to suspect a seduction and to suspect the extent of it. The title comes from a somewhat unknown function of catfish in the fishing industry and is made clear late in the film. It's not a great movie but it is a good movie to watch if you can be patient."
1,Waste of time,"Let me save you some time and money. Don't watch this film. Knew nothing about it, but was totally predictable, and boring."
5,"Awesome movie, surprise ending",Heard about this movie from friends and it turned to be surprisingly funny yet touching all the same. Lots of surprises!
4,Give it a chance & decide for yourself!,Ignore the reviews telling you not to watch this film. Watch it then decide for yourself. Not everybody likes the same movies so you need to be the judge. I enjoyed it because i like piecing things together. I don't know what the people were expecting who left negative reviews. . Its a documentary not an action film! Maybe they just didn't pick up or understand the little details? But anyway its a good story about a lonely person with some obstacles in life who created a new life in her head & online.
1,Seriously?,"I am a film fanatic. I have lots of respect for amateur film makers and independent projects. I go to film festivals whenever I can, and make donations to various colleges for film school scholarships. DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME ON CATFISH. It simply just doesn't deliver...I don't know who paid off the movie critics, but it's obvious that SOMEONE did. Probably Nev's family are the culprits, as they are very wealthy NYC socialites. That is all."
5,It kept my attention,Very interesting film on issues that is connected to the internet.It really kept my attention to the very end.
4,Let this be a lesson to everyone,"that no matter how much you lie, your chest will never be as hairy as that dudes.On the plus side... Im going to be more honest about myself."
3,Encapturing but not believable,"I was really excite to see this movie after watching the trailer. A REALLY great teaser. But it didn't really meet expectations. The makers try to say that it's a true story and is being filmed as they go on this journey, but I find that unrealistic. Good story--totally crazy--but honstly, they could've made it more thrilling by just making it a hollywood movie with paid actors. There are big debates up all over the internet as to whether it's real or fake (I'd the overwhelming majority say fake). It's almost just a fail because they're trying to make it more popular by saying it's real. Yet again, it could probably would be better if they just took the Paranormal movie route and not try to claim it as reality. I think it's worth just watching just to make your own decision! Watch it. It's fun, entertaining, and will get you to think, but don't expect too much from it."
2,Catfish,The movie left me with a depressed feeling. The movie did not fit the description as a suspense-thriller. Would only recommend if I wanted to make someone feel sad or to keep my daughters off facebook.
3,Interesting story of a Crazy Person,Very interesting if you like to watch how people can be basic mental cases and create elaborate psychopathic behaviors. Good Movie
4,something different and very entertaining,"This film works best if you don't know the story going in, but even if you do, it's still fascinating viewing. I was hooked from the first frame to the last. If you are at all into social websites, Catfish is a must see. There is some controversy as to whether this film is a true documentary or somewhat scripted. I don't know, but I do know that the complex range of emotions it exposes in its subjects and the like emotions it produces in the viewer are all very real."
4,"Don't watch the trailer, just see the movie...",An amazing social experiment gone right. A stranger outcome than the film makers could have predicted. Truth is absolutely stranger than fiction. A must see for anyone living in this technological age..
4,Keeps you wanting to see more!,Great film! I was able to watch the complete film while working out. It is a very compelling documentary. Must see!
5,The fragile human mind,"This was really a great look into the human mind. What we want to be and who we really are. How frail our psyches truly are, and the power they also have for our survival.Really must be seen to truly appreciate it."
5,Super scary,This movie is crazy! I feel so bad that this happened to nev. but for exposing the reality of Facebook!! It's nuts what people can do behind the facade of a profile!
3,"""Catfishing"" is a new verb for a faux composite internet girlfriend","Had to see this movie after hearing the word ""Catfishing"" to describe the plight of the Notre Dam Heismann trophy contender."
5,Great movie,Didn't watch this until after I saw a few episodes of the MTV show. I found it very interesting and well done.
4,stunning,"be careful what you wish for. this movie definitely had me wondering if this were a true story. good delivery, crazy concept executed really well."
1,To those of you expecting a graphic twist,"The trailer made it seem to have a great end twist. I was hoping for a death, some running, and possibly some screaming... tears... etc. No, none of that. Totally predictable with that in mind.... don't watch. It's slow and boring, and not even worth 1 star. It was in select theaters for a reason..."
1,"Hook, line and stinker","""Catfish"" is not a horror movie. It isn't even a psychological thriller. It's psychological only in the fact that anybody who made this bit of nothing into a film must have forgotten to wear their brain bucket on a head-first parachute dive.""Catfish"" is akin to a 90-minute build-up to an orgasm that somehow gets sidetracked into volunteer work at a hospice center. This is ""Paranormal Activity"" if you took out the paranormal and the activity. I was robbed. You have been warned."
1,"Didn't make it to the end, even the last third, loathed it.","From the opening credits, to the intro shot of our ""hero"" talking with his mouth full (watching, hearing, that food, in too close, jerky photography) my stomach began to turn - I hated this movie. I'm not sure I'd call it a documentary. Can narcicism be a documentary? He's right - he's not that interesting. Oh, photography and self absorbtion, look at my cell phone, look at my ipod, look at my cell phone, see how relevant all this irrelevance is, that makes a story right? Click. Click. Photo computer screen. Ahhhhhhhhh, run, run, run.I just fast forwarded it through it all and felt dirty having viewed it. It's like a dull 16 year old's head."
2,Catfish,"The trailers and advertisements for this movie made it seem like it's a thriller movie, which it's totally not. It's a very boring, over rated movie. I personally couldn't stand the main character at all, he was annoying and didn't seem real. I wouldn't recommended this movie. It might have actually been a cool movie if the person at the end was a serial killer, like the ads for this movie made it seem like, but like I said, it's nothing like you think and is very boring. The movie is about meeting a person online who has false identities and IS NOT A KILLER. So if that sounds interesting to you, than go ahead and watch this boring movie. I was very upset at this movie because of the false advertisements."
4,The truth has a price.,"Some people like the taste of catfish, others prefer salmon. I just saw a very interesting film called 'Catfish', and it seems to have much the same effect. Why is the authenticity of documentaries always questioned? Are we really that cynical? Yes, we are. If Morgan Spurlock ('Supersize Me') called it ""the best fake documentary I've ever seen"", well... isn't that something? In 'Catfish', the players believe what they want to believe, without a good reason not to. We take for granted that the relationships are almost completely dependent on facebook profiles and message boards. I'd hate to spoil what happens next, because it really is worth seeing. Those expecting an mind-blowing twist might be disappointed, but as Nev slowly uncovers the truth, we can't help but be taken along. The film and the people in it are entertaining and kind-hearted; quite why you'd care if it's real or not is a mystery to me."
1,Trailer better than the movie,Trailer leads you to believe that there will be a big twist at the end but it never comes. The closer and closer the movie got to the end the more frustrated I became realizing there would be no reveal. The only surprise is you find out why the movie is titled Catfish.
1,So what?,"What an intellectually vacuous ""documentary""! Someone on facebook claims to be someone that they are not and it is worth making a documentary about? I found myself asking myself ""so what?"" through out the movie and never found the answer. A total waste of time."
1,Waste of time,"I saw this in theaters after being told that ""not knowing about what happens in the movie makes it better."" This was apparently a common thing critics said. Well, it turns out that they were right. Not knowing about this movie would make it better. Walk away now, before you waste even a moment of your life on this poorly plotted, predictable, anti-thrill ride of a non-adventure.Edit: I know you're probably thinking ""wow, that guy's review didn't tell me anything about the movie."" So here's a bit more detail: You know that guy who keeps emailing you about wiring $10,000,000 from his family's fortunes? Do you think he is who he says he is? Congratulations. You've just discovered an analogy for the plot of the film: people aren't who they claim to be on the internet. SHOCKER."
2,get real,"First of all, if you think this is a real documentary, you are unbelievably gullible. It's clearly a ""fake"" documentary like Paranormal Activity or Cloverfield. Second, the marketing campaign for this movie made it seem like a scary thriller. It's not. Not at all. Not even close. It's a drama, and not an entirely bad one. But I was left disappointed due to the bait-and-switch of the ad campaign. If they had marketing it honestly, I wouldn't feel ripped off."
2,PLEASE READ REVIEWS BEFORE VIEWING,"Don't be like me and watch the trailer and not read the review. Like many others, I was sucked in to the trailer! The trailer ended with a quote pretending the last 40 minutes of the movie were going to be intense. I got to the half way point of the movie and couldn't wait to see what happened, especially after he looks into the barn. Then I waited and waited and waited for something to happen. I was like a kid on Christmas morning opening up socks after socks, waiting for a toy! This movie is not a thriller, barely a drama. It is a made up story of some weird lady on the internet. It would have probably been a great movie if it had been a thriller or action movie for the last 40 minutes. Please save the 1.5 hours of your life and do not watch this."
2,Soul-matin' on the internet...,"Here is some reality-TV crap disquised as a documentary movie. It covers the vapidity of the cellphone-generation craze of yammering with strangers on the internet. Folks with that kind of penchant might go for this, but sadly, most can spend the time better by just going on the net and searching for someone to piss off on their own behalf."
1,Product Did Not Work,"This would not load correctly (never had problems with anything else) so I wasted my $2.99. Happily, the movie was on MTV later that week, so I did get to see it, and the movie was great."
1,I am so sad I wasted those 90 minutes!,"I kept waiting for something to happen that I didn't expect, but it didn't happen. I can't believe the word ""thriller"" was actually used. In reality, it bored me to death. I think the storyline was stolen from a Law and Order episode, which wasn't particularly thrilling either, but at least had a little drama. The word ""disappointment"" is not strong enough. You'd think the principles in this expect that everyone on the internet is exactly who they say they are. In case you didn't figure it out, there's no guarantee anyone on the internet isn't making up everything they relate to you."
3,So-so documentary,"I wasn't really crazy about this movie. File it under ""just ok"". I had just watched The Imposter, and Catfish just couldn't stand up to that movie. The trailer is a little misleading, I think. It makes you believe there is something more sinister happening then just a lonely, isolated lady misrepresenting herself online to a younger man."
2,Boring,Too predictable . Sloooooooooooooooooooooooooooooow moving. No plot . Bad acting. Vague character evolution.I would not recommend paying for this movie
4,Edge of seat,"Kept me on the edge of my seat. I didn't know what to expect next. Very interesting & entertaining. Also, an unexpected ending"
1,catcrap,"If someone had left a review like I'm about to then I never would've wasted my time with it.SPOILERSPOILERSPOILERA guy has an on-line relationship with a girl he has never met and decides to go pay her a surprise visit with, I believe it was two of his buddies.When he gets there the girl is a fraud.Tha's it. That's basically the whole movie.Enjoy."
5,If you like the show you'll love the film,"Really fun to see Nev in his awkward stage and to come to know how he got his start in Internet un-matchmaking. His internet crush was so messed up. I love how Nev always tries to walk in the other person's shoes, find the positives and work things through with people. A refreshing opposite to most reality shows which try to destroy friendships or lives for the ratings. Also, liked finding out where the term Catfish came from."
5,very interesting,"i would recommend, was very interesting the way it took different turns. And Nev is such a sweet guy in the show."
5,Very Interesting....,"Without question a movie that many could relate late to whether they choose to admit it or not! I have heard this type of story before, now you are seeing it."
5,Amazing!!!,"I appreciated this film so much. The editing, the footage, and the story was awesome. I like the MTV shows a lot but this film dealt deeper into some of the issues people deal with to make them act out."
4,Excellent product!,I do have this LCD and let me say that when properly calibrated. The colors and PQ is so amazing! even though it takes 1080i input..is nontheless a full HDTV the differences between 1080i and 1080p with respects to this TV is sooo minimal...
1,"Toshiba 4"" REGZA - VERY DISAPPOINTED !!!","I own this TV for 2 years. Toshiba replaced the entire flat panel LCD at the end of the first year because the panel failed and went black. Luckily, I reported it with only 1 week left on the warranty. 6 months later the LCD panel display went bad again... this time.. wavy images (like shadows) in the background. Called Toshiba and got the company line... ""we're sorry you're having trouble with your TV (again). Tough luck... you are off warranty. Investigated cost of repairing. A whopping $3300.Long story very short... I parted ways with Toshiba... with some pretty bitter feelings. I bought this TV for $2400 (reduced price). What did I get? An unreliable peice of crap...We no longer look at Toshiba products. They are banned for life in this family. Back to SONY products..."
2,Playing Cards,"The cards are fine, but the order was not filled correctly. I ordered 10 blue decks and 10 red decks. I received 9 and 11 decks. Plus, I have done this review once before. Do you people know what you are doing?"
1,Unwatchable,"This wasn't funny-in-a-bad-way. This was a few guys with too much money who tried to make a movie, who paid no attention to the script, acting, or anything and just rolled camera.It is truly unwatchable, and I'm a B-Movie aficionado of sorts.I'm sorry fellas, I'm sure it was fun to make (it seems like it to me) but the end product is on par with a wickedly embarrassing home movie that should be lost in the basement and never found."
4,A must read!,"John Storm Roberts book ""The Latin Tinge"", is a superb book on the history of Latin music. The book is well written and clearly takes the reader through a remarkable journey, showing the evolution and the development of Latin music and its impact on the American music scene. Highly recommended!"
4,Review of the action figure,The legolas doll is very detailed and fun. Although his hair is brownish and not blonde (like it should be) and the arrows break easily. Also the handles to all the knives broke within a few weeks. So all in all its a cool collectible but not a durable toy.
4,Very sturdy and good looking post,"We got this mailbox post along with the matching mailbox and it looks great. My only ding against this post is that it is a bit tall, which means that you have to dig a little more to get the desired depth so that your mailbox is at the appropriate height.That said, it's solid in the ground and looks great."
5,Love it,My husband just installed this along with the Coronado mailbox I bought with the post. It is sturdy and looks great with the mailbox. Quality and finish are very good and my husband said it was an easy installation. Couldn't be happier with the purchase!
5,New mailbox,We bought the mailbox and matching post. Both are of excellent quality and the price was very good as compared to other online sites. We are very pleased.
2,It's Rusting Away!,"Looks Great but the arm holding the mailbox, along with parts of the mailbox and its hardware are rusting away.The door latch has broken but customer service gladly sent a new one.I purchased two mailboxes; the ""Keystone"" mailbox still looks great but the ""Architectural"" Mailbox is falling apart. I believe it was ... Made In China."
4,Dione Warwick in Paris - delighted to find it on CD,I have this album on an old LP that I found years ago in a second hand record store. Have'nt played it in years because I don't have a turntable. I was delighted to find it on a CD and have been playing it since I got it in the mail. Wonderful!
4,Good tea,"This roasted green tea has a great flavor, different from any other tea i have had, the only problem is:you can get this at your local asian grocery for about $1.99 a box"
4,Surprisingly Delicious,"The unique roasted flavor really stands out. I've had this tea before from a different vendor which was good as well. But this was definitly better, and surprised me. So, I recommend giving it a try!"
4,Pleasant love story,Jab We Met (When We Met) is a romantic comedy focused on a rich young businessman. The man is depressed when his mother remarries. He goes into a daze and randomly boards a train. He meets a young girl who stops him from killing himself. He feels grateful and wants to help her. She is trying to elope. He accompanies her to the town where her fiancée lives and then leaves her. Later her family comes to him asking where their daughter is. He goes to find her and returns with her.
3,"Yes, no, maybe...","This is not a must-see movie. It is not among the better Bollywood romcoms. For one, Pyar ke Side Effects was much, much better. However, it is not bad, either.The good: The acting by Shahid Kapur and Kareena Kapoor and just about every one else in the film. The sets and locations. The dance sequences. Shahid is an excellent dancer.The not so good: there is nothing original about the story. You do not get a real sense of how or why Aditya falls for Geet. Kareena is a weak dancer.Bottom-line: Pleasant and watchable but not above average--except for the acting and chemistry of the leads."
4,sweet film,"This is a very sweet film (although perhaps idealistic). I'm not a fan of Kareena Kapoor but she was pretty cute in this movie. Though there is some drama throughout the film, it is definitely a happy ending (which is what I care about) and the characters fit well together. I love the depiction of the Panjabi style family. It was heart warming and endearing. The songs were a bit hit or miss for me but it was, overall, a great movie!"
2,Not a favorite book,"It is an old book, so I don't know what I expected. Turns out it's not my style."
1,Geox Women's Candy Loafer,"I wore these shoes one time. One shoe came apart at the seam, I couldn't return the shoes due to I purchased the shoes in the summer and did not wear them until the fall (2007)."
3,Pruning book,"This is the second pruning book I have purchased and it was okay, not as helpful as I was hoping."
5,helpful pruning,"I'm an arborist and it's always helpful to have a great book that can helpwith plants that I don't know by heart, this is just that book. This is my 3rd copy as I keep giving them to others that I know would gain great ""how to do it right"" knowledge. So many people just start cutting away on trees and shrubs and end up doing so much damage to them that they end up dying or close to it. This book will help you make the right choices and correct cuts to make on trees and shrubs for all your pruning needs. If you want success this is the book to help you reach it."
5,This was a gift book for an Astros fan - he was delighted!,This was the perfect gift I could give to one of my friends in Houston Texas - Even I don't know them myself after I have gotten enthousiatic remarks about the book I must admit it was really great to make somebody happy with a good book about his favorite baseball team!Thanks!
3,Weak ending,"While I enjoyed the first two books in the Reardon Brothers Triology and looked forward to this last book, I am sad to say that disappointment in the last three chapters of the book abound. While it was predictable to a point, the ending did not meet my expectations. The ending of the book was quite far-fetched to say the least. Any of us who read the first two books and remember the portrayal of Drew, the youngest of the Reardon brothers will find that Freedom's Belle did not follow the same path. The entire book up until the end was exactly what we had pictured and contained the detail we love from Dianna Crawford, however, the ending unfortunately overshadowed the great beginning. You would be better off not reading the third book of this triology and keep Dianna's first two as memories of a great story."
4,Freedom's Belle,We were looking for stories by Dianna Crawford. We are very pleased with the book and have enjoyed reading it.
4,Reardon Brothers Trilogy-Book 3,"Desperate to escape the cruel man her parents insist she marry, Crystabelle grasps at the chance of a teaching position in a remote settlement beyond the mountains. Surely neither her betrothed nor her father will find her there! And she will be free to pursue the independent life of which she has always dreamed.A beautiful, refined heiress is the last person Drew would expect to be seeking passage overmountain to Tennessee Territory. But the lovely miss seems determined to procure the position of schoolmistress to Reardon Valley's youngsters. Dubious but intrigued, Drew finds himself helping her achieve her goal. Once he gets her safely to the valley, though, he'll be off again. Not even the growing threat to Crystabelle's safety can dissuade him from exploring his beloved wilderness...or can it?As the two join forces, they learn the true meaning of adventure and freedom--but a shocking betrayal threatens to tear it away from them forever."
5,A feminist scrutiny of the metaphors present in the biblical tales,"Written by Nicole Wilkinson Duran (part-time pastor at Trinity United Presbyterian Church), Having Men for Dinner: Biblical Women's Deadly Banquets is a scholarly examination of biblical stories of women who kill - in particular, women who kill through the use of serving food and drink, or providing hospitality and comfort to lower the guard of their enemies. Having Men for Dinner covers topics as dark and gritty as the Old Testament stories themselves, such as ruthless revenge for rape victims, the threat of war and genocide, and cold-blooded slaying. A feminist scrutiny of the metaphors present in the biblical tales, and how they speak both to the generations of history and to the modern era, distinguishes the meticulous tone of Having Men for Dinner; study questions to stimulate further discussion round out this excellent supplement for private, group or instructional biblical studies."
4,the power of myth,"It seems that the quest of this book by Markale is to explain the Celts through the power of their myths. Noble goal, indeed, and Markale succeeds in describing the history and the emmense influence the Celts had on Western Europe...even by today's standards.... a great deal of which he does by recalling mythical incidents. His history, as always, is nearly flawless, unbias, and interesting.But I got somewhat bored with Markale's constant comparisons of Celtic myth figures to Biblical and Greco-Roman figures. Back in the days of Charles Squire this may have been necissary, but I found it tedious in this work. Not just tedious, but irrelevant and not slightly irritating.If you can get past the many subtle personal commentary and criticism, the work has great merit. Markale is a notable historian and I especially recommend his work ""The Druids""."
5,Very Informative,This book is the most informative book I have found about the Celts. The explanation of the ancient meaning of the word Myth to the Historic Origins was unique! I truly loved this book.
5,Great pictures and facts!!,A really fun book. Outstanding photos. Made me want to go out and see what is there now!! We've lost too many true treasures.Larry is a great story-teller and fact-finder.
4,Excellent Find!,"So far the best architectural book I've read, especially since I'm from the area of the subjects."
5,A great movie you have got to see!,"Zack is the class president, captain of the team, and the all around big man on campus. But after he is dumped by his popular girlfriend for another guy, he bets his friends that he can turn class reject, Laney, into the prom queen to prove that he's still the best. Did Zack do too good of a job on Laney or is she all that?"
4,"Um... read this, even if i only gave it 4 star. it was bcuz","Um, okay, that guy who saw this movie 7 times, please get a life. Yes, it was a good movie. but admit it, only cause Freddie was in it. By the way, I know him, and he's really nice and cool, not really like that movie, and he owns a JEep Wrangler."
4,Very Adorable!!!!!,"In one split second Lanie Boggs (Rachel Leigh Cook) went from nobody to somebody. I thought this movie was very lovable even though it's a tale that's already been told a number of times before. Ater being dumped by Taylor Vaughn, Zach (Freddie Prinze Jr.) bets one of his classmates that he could use his popularity, and turn any girl in their whole school and make her not only popular but, turn her into the prom queen. Lanie Boggs was chosen to be that girl but, all that comes to a screeching halt when Zach falls in love with Lanie. This movie is not a masterpiece or a classic but, it is a good date movie."
5,it rules,"i think that ""shes all that"" is a great movie because right when i saw it i kept on wacthing it over and over again then i finally bought the movie.i think that all people sould watch it because it is about a very unpopular girl (laney) who gets bet on by a boy (zack) who was just dumped by his incredibaly cute girl friend.well just before a party zack gives her a make over that turns her into the most poupler girl."
4,what did you REALLY expect?,"For all you that expected this to be a wonderful, perfect, truly inspirational movie, this is NOT the one! But for those of you that want to see an ispirational, cute, cheesy-romance type of movie, this IS the one! ""She's all that"" is the kind of movie that leaves you with a happy feeling and hope for yourself if you feel like you're geeky laney. The acting's not great, the cinematography's not perfect, but it's cute and worth your time to rent at least once. (plus, if you like matthew lilard, he's a riot in this movie!)"
3,A typical teeney-bopper flick,"I enjoyed this movie, though I'm not a teenager anymore (thank goodness!). I liked Freddie and Rachel together as Zach and Laney. The thing that I didn't like about the movie was turning Laney into a copy of the rest of the popular girls. She was beautiful before the hair cut and little red dress. I wish Zach had fallen for her ""as is"", glasses and all, rather than after the ""miraculous"" transformation. She had a great personality, very down to earth. Certainly she was worth 100 times the rest of them. Zach was your typical popular guy, but I agree with a former reviewer. He should have defended her when Taylor poured wine down her dress. But I guess you can't expect the god of the campus to defend the class ""weirdo"". What would everybody think? But it was nice to see the change in him from going to ""the bet"" guy, to the sincere, caring guy. On the whole, it was a fun movie. So what happens after graduation?"
2,MY FAIR LADY FOR A YOUNGER GENERATION,"First there was Rex Harrison and Audrey Hepburn NOW we have Freddie Prince Jr. and Rachael Leigh Cook. The story line is almost the same. Prince(In the Proffesor Higgins' type role)bets he can transform Cook(Eliza Doolittle) into one of the most popular girls in school. Just like Harrison bet he can transform Hepburn into a ""lady"". This turned out to be a cute teen film, I guess. The characters were easy to not only follow but like as well,only it just seemed so BORING as after a while. I couldn't wait to leave the theather! If your into these's romantic first love teen films...then you've found the jackpot. OTHERWISE STAY AWAY!"
4,"Cute, mindless and entertaining","A nice movie to watch. Yes, it's a bit hokey, but this movie is for fun, and it's a great date movie."
5,AWESOME MOVIE!,This movie was the best! It's got humor and romance. Rachel and Freddie are both awesome in this. I definatly recommend this movie to everyone
5,GREAT MOVIE,This movie was great and i really loved it and Freddie prinze jr is so Hot!!!! To all you who haven't seen it..... GO SEE IT!!!!!
3,Not HALF as bad as I thought it'd be.,"I only saw this because Rachel Leigh Cook is a hotty, but I ended up liking it more than I expected. Freddy Prinz Jr. played a good part, and he was surpringly likable, maybe even too likeable. If we were supposed to belive he was the jerk who eventually fell for the dork, it didn't work. He seemed to like her throughout, and never showed that he had no interest in her. But it's kind of nice to see a movie where we like the good-guys and hate the bad-guys the way we're supposed to. Matthew Liliard is hilarious, as always. I wished he had a bigger part. But, most of the movie was predictalbe, cliche, been there, done that...etc. I wish I could give it Two and a Half stars, but since I couldn't I decided to be nice and go for three. It's not a complete waste of time, if you're not expecting much that is."
5,Freddie's best yet,I loved this movie. I've rented it twice and I've already watched it 5 times. It is one of the best movies I've seen recently. Freddie is sooo hot in this movie and they could not have found a better person for the part. Rachel is just adorable throughout the movie. I love her prom dress. Well anyway. I would definitely suggest this movie to anyone. The cast is one of the best.
5,excellent!,"I thought this was such a good movie,the scene where Laney is humliated by Taylor at the party really brought tears to my eyes. it's a really fun movie."
1,Beware! this movie will make you gay!,"when this movie ended i thought i just came out of an acid trip.i was hypnotized by the movie's horrible acting and plot.this movie is just another stereotype revolving around the good looking athletic high schoolers, and the notgoodlooking artistic highschoolers. i felt violated and noticed i my intelligence dropped. this is my generation at its prime; MTV spring break, high school and college keg parties, LSD raves and teenage sex. and there you have itso my advice to anyone who wants to see this film is:""Shes all that"" will make you gay!"
3,Not Bad,"She's All That is not as funny as the recent teen films released recently such as 10 Things..and Never been Kissed but it's still a nice movie.Freddie Prinze Jr is dumped by his 'popular' girlfriend and takes on a bet to transform any girl his friend picks into someone just as popular.Of course, the girl is the most clumsy and awkward female in the entire school with absolutely no social graces or dress sense. And she finds out about the bet just when he realises how he really feels about her and then he has some serious making up to do!A bit slow in places but it will make you smile."
1,Ukkkkkkk. Don't make me watch it again.........,"I have a few words of advice. Don't see this movie. The plot is uncreative, and very sterotipical. It was predicible and pretty obnoxious. It is a teenybobber romance flick, and although I am a teen, I prefer movies with more substance. I don't like FPj either. I thought the acting was bad and the movie was worse. If you want to see something like this, although it is worlds better, try the moderinzed version of ""The Taming of the Shrew"" aka, Ten things I hate about you."
2,As exciting as a plain rice cake,"And I'm not just saying this because I'm a ""grown up"". I LOVE teen movies (Never Been Kissed, Lucas, Breakfast Club, etc.), but the first time I saw this movie I walked in while my roommate was in the middle of it and within 5 minutes I knew everything I needed to about these characters. None of them had any personality to speak of. Laney, especially, STARTS OFF interesting enough but falls flat after she's made over. There's no spark to her whatsoever! I didn't care if they wound up together - the only thing that kept me watching was the hope that the popular girl would get mauled by llamas. She didn't."
4,"A hip,hopping romantic love story","When me and my sister went to see this movie we thought it would be a hopless dull movie. But I was wrong this movie is one of the best films of 99 so far, it's also one of the best teenage films of all times. This is a great movie, I recommend it big time."
5,it's about college story,"that zak and his friends were looking for girls, all of them found ...but zak was the last to find an ugly girl wich is racheal ,he made her very beautiful and took her to the prom."
3,"She's All That - Good movie, Bad DVD","Well, I have always been into these kinds of movies about the young Generation X. I heard from my teenage sister that this movie is definitely all that. So is it? &#63728;&#63728; One of the reasons why I was hesitant on buying this DVD is because there is only one extra and that's the music video by Sixpence None the Richer. There is no trailer, nothing....For DVD enthusiasts, this is not cool!As for the movie, I enjoyed the movie. I enjoyed the dance scene during the prom. Freddie Prinze Jr. and Rachael Leigh Cook did a great job. Also, you can see a special small cameo of Buffy the Vampire Slayer star, Sarah Michelle Gellar in the cafeteria scene. This movie is a fun movie to watch, but as a DVD...there should have been more included.The movie was fun to watch...but the DVD was just blah! No extras...no good rating! Hope Miramax remembers that if they want their DVD's to be bought that rented, they need to add more to their DVD releases."
4,It's the Details that Count,"I could write about the fine job Rachael Leigh Cook does in this film, and she does. But I'd rather talk about the camerawork. The opening sequence of this film is the best steady cam work I've seen. The camera flows through the corridors of the high school as all the major characters strut into frame to the beat of the soundtrack. It's a real tour de force and I just felt somebody ought to point it out.The choreography in the dance sequence at the Prom is commendable too. Good going.The DVD is quite nice, if minimalistic. I enjoyed the music video. Well worth a buy for fans of the genre."
3,Zach Silar needs a spine!,"I find it odd that Zach, student body prez, who makes some geek ""hoover"" his own pubes, doesn't have the decency to defend poor Laney Boggs. His ex-chick spills wine onto that beautiful red dress and then insults Laney, his ""best friend"" makes the moves on her right in front of his face, and finally, Zach can't even admit his own feelings for Laney until it's too late. I don't understand why he went out with Taylor in the first place! Overall, a silly teenage flick which provides some warmth and laughs, and uses exaggerated characterizations to demonstrate the trials of high school life. Rachael Leigh Cook is a warm and sensitive individual. She doesn't have the curves of JLH or SMG, but I would definitely go out with her, glasses or contacts. I imagine girls think highly of Freddie Prinze also. Some of the characters did remind me of people I knew in high school. My class didn't have that many cool dancers, though!"
4,Better than I expected,"This movie was rather charming, and I found myself enjoying it despite my preconceived ""sappy teenage romantic comedy"" attitude. Freddy Prinze Jr. made it quite easy for the audience to fall in love with Zach. He made the character charming and sweet, although his indecisions at certain moments made me a little steamed. Rachael Leigh Cook was great as the independently confident, Laney. The kicker is that even though Laney seems quite self-assured, you realize that she's just working to build up her confidence just like the rest of us. There are moments where things got too corny, like the scene between Zach & his father arguing about college, the rest of the movie is quite entertaining & loaded with laughter."
3,Pretty good,"This is better than many teen movies. It has some charming moments and witty lines, and Matthew Lillard's character is really funny. Prinze Jr and Cook are great in their roles too, The plot is very formulaic and predictable, not least because Rachel Leigh Cook's amazingly good looks can't help but shine through her 'freak' clothes and look...that is you know she is easily going to be transformed into a beautiful and desirable girl. The chemistry between Zach and Lanely is very convincing at first...there is a point in the plot where this reaches its peak and their coming together would have been better. But instead we have to have all the usual obstacles keeping them apart...and by the time they come together, I felt something was lacking and I didn't care about them as much. Appealing for teens and worth seeing if you're in the mood for something light and undemanding."
4,A Good Film,"The storyline has been used loads of times but this still shines as a good film. Zac(Freddie Prince Jnr.), the most popular boy in High School gets dumped by his spoilt girlfriend Taylor. Zacs friends then say hes lost it so he makes a bet that he can turn any girl into the Prom Queen. His friend picks Leyonie, a weird and scary art student. He loses the bet but gets the girl .The story is good and so is the film. See It."
3,"Good, but there's better out there.","Pity poor ""Can't Hardly Wait."" It had twice the charm of this movie and a much sharper script, and less than half the box office. Timing, timing, timing.That's not to say ""She's All That"" is terrible (apart from the cringe-inducing title). It's just even lighter and fluffier than its predecessors. The characterization and plotting are more musical depth than movie depth.Still, the occasional bit sparkles. What I enjoyed were the breaks from teen-movie conventions; the hilarious ""Real World"" riffs, a truly bizarre performance art piece, some poignant backstory on Cook's character. And, of course, you couldn't ask for more photogenic and amiable heroes than Rachael Leigh Cook and Freddie Prinze Jr.All in all an undeniably fun, if surprise-free, flick. Think of it as an updated Grease, not an updated My Fair Lady, and you should have a good time."
5,This movie was so cute!,"I have to say I really enjoyed this movie. It made me wish my high school years were exactly like this movie. The movie was very predictable, but it let you believe that losers get chances too. The only thing I did not like about the movie was LiL Kim. I think she is absolutely gross, and needs to stay behind closed doors, until she learns that that body doesn't belong in those cloths."
1,"This exemplifies what is bad about ""teen movies""","Not only is this film completely predictable, it is also entirely implausible. Cook is simply NOT believable as the ""ugly duckling."" The characterizations are one-dimensional, and the plot twists are as stagey and disconnected as would be in a high school skit.Is it any wonder that this was the primary source for ""Not Another Teen Movie""?"
4,Early version lacks 5.1,"Four out of 5 stars - need the Dolby 5.1 version.I really enjoyed the DVD, but bought it too early! My understanding is that early copies either did not carry or would not select the Dolby digital 5.1 audio and instead reverted to Dolby 2.0. Even the keep case promoted 5.1 when you aren't able to select it from a menu, and it won't automatically select (at least for me, my 5.1 decoder is in my audio system, not my DVD player).BUT - I think newer copies (starting in mid-August?) had this corrected and I'm looking into replacing my copy. If you have an old one, check into this replacement because the 5.1 soundtrack would make the DVD much more enjoyable! Because internet sites and the keep case promoted a 5.1 soundtrack, I think purchasers are entitled to it."
1,Three words: Pretty In Pink,"This movie simply rehashes outdated hackneyed one-dimensional teen movie prototypes: the snobby popular kids, the mean prom queen, the geeks, the perfect GQ guy that falls for a girl geek. Even John Hughes gave his characters more dimension and credibility in most of his movies than this flick does. John Hughes movies (and others like them) were okay for the 80's because they exemplified the materialistic and conformist attitudes of the era. Now, these types of movies just appear outdated and silly--and characters like Taylor certainly would not win any popularity contests, unless they attended high school in an insane asylum.For a more realistic high school comedy that better fits the times, check out '10 Things I Hate About You.'"
1,A story that you have seen a thousand times.,"You take a tedious screenplay, a boring soundtrack and mediocre actors and you'll get a film like ""She's all that"". My godness why are the most teen films of the recent years so bad. Equal if you take ""I know what you did last Summer"" or ""Dirty Dancing"". They are all stale. If you want to see good teen films that watch ""Blackboard Jungle"" or ""Grease""."
2,This movie was oddly confusing.,"Laney was never a geek- she was just unsuperficial, even if she was kind of cynical and mean. Then, Freddie Prinze has her wear this really small red dress, and they dance by a pool. There were a couple funny scenes, like when Zach does his hackey-sack thing on stage and one really funny character, (played by Matthew Lillard) but it was predictable, and kind of strange. Why did Laney have to change, anyway?"
5,And for all of those who don't like beautiful actors....,"this movie is not for you. The plot is My Fair Lady redone in modern times. One must admit that the costume designer could have dressed the people a lot better, but all in all. Must see, good plot, great actors, funny light humor."
1,She's most definitely NOT all 'that'................,"Hello? The characters were 'real'?!?! Yeah right, and I'm the Queen of Sheba. This movie was a pathetic attempt at an update of the classic Pygmalion. It was just an excuse for movie execs to waste time and money on churning out run-of-the-mill 'teen' films, in order to cash in on this sudden 'boom' in the industry. It is a real shame that the other underrated, and brilliant films: Go and Election flopped, because 'teens' preferred to see this pretentious nonsense rather than watch fantastic actresses such as Sarah Polley and Reese Witherspoon in action. It's also sad to see that Freddie Prinze Jr. and Rachel Leigh Cook still have acting careers. I guess they 'worked' as part of the set pieces - they both certainly seem to blend in well with the wooden chairs."
1,This movie is NOT all that,"I can't believe that people actually like this movie. Most intelligent movie goers were not impressed. The acting is insipid, the plot unoriginal, and the charcters are WAY too stereotypical. Don't even wait for this to come to TV."
5,"The Best Movie, Even Better Than Titanic! It's the COOLEST!","""She's All That"" is the best movie that I have ever seen!!! If you see one movie this year, this is the one!!! This movie is not only funny, but it is romantic. ""Laney"" plays a not so popular girl, but things change when she meets ""Zach"". This is the COOLEST movie ever made and if you haven't seen it, I would see as soon as possible!!!"
1,lousy movie,"I can't figure out why there's such a lot of hue and cry about this movie. it was supposed to be a bit funny, touching, romantic and failed miserably at everything. where teen movies are concerened ""clueless"" will always be the best and no one will remember this movie in 20 years."
5,cute movie,"Although very unrealistic, I loved the movie. It will be outdated in a few years, but it's a feel good, happy movie."
1,Terribly Trashy!,I hated this movie it was so bad that Snow White was better I thought it was awful so my advice for you is to see a different movie this summer!
3,Where is the soundtrack?,loved the movie. thought it was a great date movie. my question is where is the soundtrack? the movie has so many great bands. fatboy slim and sixpense none the richer. where is the soundtrack!
3,hottie,"Although she doesn't always look hot, Rachel Leigh Cook is HOT in this movie. Check out the Sixpence video ""Kiss Me"" if you really want to see her in all her dusky beauty."
3,4:3 Letterboxed,Both the 1999 and 2011 DVD releases are 4:3 letterboxed.... not widescreen as advertised.Ignore these few extra words here at the end - needed to meet the minimum word count.
2,"SHE MIGHT BE ALL THAT, BUT THIS MOVIE IS NOT!","A decent cast can't keep this retread of 'Pretty In Pink' from becoming boring and predictable. I knew what to expect watching this film, but it just does't have anything going for it other than the two likable leads.The is nothing new here and what is here has been done better many time before."
3,Tired Formula,"Another one of the many teen flicks where a ""Pretty/Ugly Girl"" gets rid of her glasses and puts on a red dress. In real life if you get rid of your glasses expect to trip over everything because you can't see 6 inches in front of your face. Prinze is the best actor since Casper Van Dien and Rachel Leigh Cook shows exactly why she is in so few movies.The hunk falls for the geek, no surprises."
4,"man, this movie suprised me!!!!!","I am not the type that usually enjoys the run-of-the-mill high school movie, but this was different. i ejoyed it from beginning to end and though the music really fit the movie, now how often does that happen????"
4,"I thought this movie was cute, but could have been better!","This movie was so awesome! It would have been better though if only Zach had fallen in love with Laney for real in the beginning. I think that would have made it the coolest movie, and everyone would've loved it. This movie is really worth the time and money, go see it!!"
3,"Good, mindless fun","This was a fun flick. I enjoyed the little directing tweaks, the general earnestness of the actors. My biggest reason for not buying it? Though it is advertized as Audio 5.1, it is not. I checked and re-checked, hoping I had missed something in the menu, but such was not the case."
4,An Apt Title If There Ever Was One...,"Although the movie starts off with Freddie Prinze Jr., it is Rachael Leigh Cook's simplicity and charm that steal the show. A very good film not only about finding yourself through your best friend, but a very good depiction of life in high school. You have the high school stud in Prinze Jr.'s Zach, the high school hottie in O'Keefe's Taylor Vaughan, the geek-turned-princess in Cook's Laney Boggs and the silly Real World actor in Matthew Lillard's Brock Hudson. A very fun romantic comedy, indeed, and Rachael Leigh Cook's performance makes you realize that She IS all that..."
2,I've seen better!,"This movie is good if you are looking for a romantic drama.But it is quite disappointing if you want a witty comedy to watch with your girlfriends. I really didn't think this was a very good movie at all.It wasn't very funny and it lacks the charm and the wit of ""10 things I hate about you"".My advice....This movie is pretty much a waste of money, and of 2 hours. Don't see it unless it's a rainy day."
5,get this movie,I Love the movie and I would reccomend it to everyone. The movie came in really quick and played well.
1,"Boring, Stupid, and a Waste of My Time","This movie was terrible. I did not expect it to be good when my sister rented it, but it was actually worse that I though. I would have given it zero stars if it wasn't for Matthew Lillard, the only interesting and funny character in the movie (tere also is no choice for zero stars). It is 100% predictable and flat-out boring (exception of Lillard)."
1,ONE FOR THE JERRY SPRINGER GENERATION!,"This movie is everthing that I hate in one. It is a deplorable display of materialistic rantings about spoilt kids whos ego's are bigger than their brains. The script is unamusing, the plot awful and actors who look as though they have been picked from a Jerry Springer audience; the concept is completely unoriginal, and as for love story, well there's less cheese on a 2kg block of edam. Stay Away!"
1,This movie wasn't that great!,"I rented this movie a couple of months ago and I really didn't like it. It was short, boring, pathedic, and the girl wasn't even that pretty. The only scene that was funny in this movie is where Matthew Lillard was going crazy at that party where he was doing that weird dance move on the floor that scene was hilarious. This movie was alot like Carrie 2 and 10 Things I Hate About You. I liked those movies alot better than this one. Don't even think about renting or buying She's All That you will not like it if I were you rent Carrie 2 or 10 Things I Hate About You."
3,Do you want realism or brain candy?,"That's the question to ask oneself. If you want a serious, realistic, artistic attempt at this age-old story... try elsewhere. If, however, you're just looking for a few laughs - you have some time to kill - this is it.The plot is predictable. The conflict is trite and contrived. BUT, let's not get so picky; it is only a movie after all. It has great style and flair, a believable resolution, ... and, most of all, two romantic leads (Freddie Prinze, Jr; and Rachel Leigh Cook) who are absolutely, blazing, heart-melting H-O-T!!! If that's enough for you, buy it."
1,Dumb,"I didn't like this movie too much. The only people that would like this movie and wouldn't think it to be stupid would be the preteen girl. And what's so great about turning a pretty girl who is an introvert into a prom queen? Now if they used some busted fat chic and turned her into a prom queen, then it would of been interesting."
2,Cute film,"This is a cute film , but we've seen this scenario before of a popular student who falls in love with an unpopular student. this film is for the youth . unfortunately this film is not Dolby Digital."
3,"I agree with the fisrt review, this movie needs a soundtrack","Well I'm 26 soon to be 27 so I felt the movie was a little young for me, but I'm sure it is the ""Dirty Dancing"" or ""Pretty Women"" among young girls. But I must add again that I absolutely loved the music and I am waiting for a soundtrack."
4,she's all that needs to have a soundtrack,"She's all that is a great movie, but it needs a soundtrack because the music is excellant."
5,Great movie to watch on a first date.,"The movie was so great, that all anyone really has to say about it, is to tell all their friends to go see this movie. The only thing that I really want to know is, Where can I get the music to that movie? Is there a soundtrack or any single hit from that movie. If anyone has any information, please to notify me. Thank you."
2,Nothing Groundbreaking,"At first glance this book looked really good however, once I purchased it I found out that it was oversimplified. Mainly just pictures of patterned movements of where to strike an attacker, with no hope of replicating the movments in real life for the average person. The best book I have come across so far is Attack Proof by Perkins. Have a look at Attack Proof first before buying this one, you wont regret it."
1,Utter Rubbish,"This book is chock full of bs, and compliant techniques.None of these techniques will work on a resisting opponent. If you try these techniques in a real world situation, you will get yourself seriously hurt, or worse. You would do well to look elsewhere for better instruction."
3,jump rope blues,the jump rope is a great item for the gym but there should be a better definition on the sizes . this jump rope is a very well built piece of equipment i will buy another one the proper size
2,Slipshod manufacture,"There was glue all over one of the handles, and the rope is made of two separate pieces stapled (!) together. I expected a lot more from Everlast."
4,Weighted Leather Jump Rope,"The product arrived in less than four days. I like the weighted handles for better leverage in twirling the rope. However, it is not so weighted at the handles where the rope snaps from the handles like some other weighted handle jump ropes.Since the rope is shipped with a rubber band around the leather rope, the user will need to flatten in a nearly straight line and allow several uses to remove the tangles."
4,good reliable jump rope,"i have no problem with this jump rope, it does not tangle, and it seems rather durable."
3,as advertised but,"all dried out, it will have to be oiled and conditioned to be usable otherwise its fine.don't forget to oil her up boys or she'll break on you"
1,same=same as the Titanic,It died on the 1st outing. Totally worthless. I did a class at Bally's. The handles don't grip so it slipped out of my hand and hit the floor. The wood broke off the handle. I continued and the other handle slipped and again the wood broke off. So now it was really unuseable. An inferior prod.
1,Rope breaks at the handles,"Was very excited to receive the rope, but because of the handle contruction, the rope rubs against the wood with every turn. After only 2 sessions, I wore halfway through the rope. A definite disappointment, since this would have been the most obvious thing for a designer to avoid. I feel like Everlast just stamped it's name on mediocrity knowing it would sell anyway...Definitely do not buy this one. I wanted to go entirely back to Buddy Lee jump ropes (which you should do if you jump inside or in a gym), but those aren't made to jump in the cold with (the rope becomes rigid). So I'll still have to look for a good cold-weather leather rope. If you're in europe, the French brand ""Excelerator"" is not that bad--much better than the Everlast, anyway."
2,Very disappointed,"I work out with 2 other women and we had been using the cheaper plastic jump ropes...they were too long for us and the one broke from the friction on the concrete. I decided to invest in some ""QUALITY"" jump ropes so we wouldn't have to replace them every few months. I purchased 2 of the weighted leather jump ropes and although the handles are commfortable and the length is better, the leather very thin and unsubstantial. When we jump there isn't enough weight to the leather to make it not get caught up in your pant legs !!! If the leather were a heavier rawhide it would be more condusive to jumping.We all 3 agree that these are not worth the price and if I could I would return them and get my money back!!!"
1,BUYER BEWARE,"This is not the jump rope you see pictured. I have bought Everlast jump ropes in the past.. the last one being in 2001. I finally needed to replace it. I ordered this listed rope from Amazon. It's not as it appears. The old Everlast jump rope has substantial leather...the one you get is a string. The old Everlast handles should weigh 1 pound..these weigh 1/2 pound. I have never been so mad at Amazon for picturing just what I wanted and getting something so far off. Mine is being returned, and I will try to repair the old one."
1,Garbage! Different Design Than My Old Everlast Jump Rope,"My old Everlast jump rope has seen a lot of use and the handles were breaking down so I bought what I thought was the exact same jump rope. I was wrong! When I tried to use the new jump rope, something was wrong. The rope wasn't turning correctly. When I compared my old jump rope and the new one I noticed that the handles on the new jump rope were considerably more heavy than the old jump rope. I'll just live with broken handles and continue to use my old Everlast."
1,Steer Clear of Title Boxing!!!!!,"I ordered a 9' weighted jump rope and was shipped a different sized rope that, obviously, doesn't fit my height. Since these are non-adjustable, I wanted to return the item for the one I ordered. I was told that it doesn't matter what item I put in my shopping cart, they can send whichever rope they want, and if I want a refund, I have to cover the return shipping."
3,Works fine for a while but breaks with regular use,"Works fine, as a jump rope should, but breaks fairly soon. I used mine maybe twice a week for less than a year before the leather broke off at the handle (unrepairable). I'm going to try another brand and see if it lasts any longer. Unfortunately I think that most jump ropes--even those with the esteemed ""Everlast"" logo--are made pretty cheaply these days."
1,Don't follow this advice,"If you truly want to become good with women this book will not help you at all. Being this direct will be a turn off to 99% of women and believe me I tried it. Read a book about being indirect, I suggest Neil Strauss's Rules of the Game."
2,Should Be Called How to Score,"Alan Roger Currie does have some good ideas in this book, like ways to get up the courage to talk to a woman if you are a shy guy. It is very hard to read because of the lack of editing. It is almost as if he published the first draft of the book because it is filled with odd capitalization, bolding and underlining. If you can get past that to the actual content, I do agree with some of his ideas, like if you are seen as ""not provocative"", most women will see you as a friend, not a lover. I don't like the author's focus on getting women into bed, but I do appreciate the fact that he encourages guys to approach women and talk to them. Sometimes, especially if you are very attractive or very successful, many men hesitate to approach you because they think you would never date them."
4,good book for what NOT to do with women,"In my opinion, this book does a much better job of telling you what behavior not to use when meeting new women, than it does of telling you what behavior to use.I would give it 5 stars for explaining the weaknesses of behavior most guys use (""nice guy"" behavior), but only 3 stars for telling us how to improve (the author basically just says be bold, upfront, and straightforward with women about what is really on your mind).I loved chapters 3, 4, 5, and 6. His whole explanation of women that are ""wholesome pretenders"" and ""erotic hypocrites"" was really, really good. I learned a lot. I would recommend reading it."
1,This book backfired on me!,"I met a girl this book was perfect for. I knew she liked me, but she wouldn't go where I wanted her to. I tried to be bold and follow this book's advice. I told her how I really felt, and... she got me to buy her a drink and then she dumped it on me in the middle of a club! I was so embarrassed! I DO NOT recommend this book, unless you want to seriously piss some girls off. Now I'm upset because I don't think I'll ever have a chance with her again. She won't even look at me if I see her on campus."
4,great bow great price,"This is a great bow. It is just what you would expect from the picture, except the fiberglass limbs are actually a dark green (not grey). Amazon did a great job shipping it to me. I chose the free super saver shipping and received my bow in five days. Amazon also sent helpful e-mails to notify and inform me of my shipment. One problem is the adjustment of the draw length and weight, but a pro shop can adjust it for you."
5,Planning to visit France?,I'm preparing for my first trip to Paris and found this book to be full of really useful information. Steves' description of the different types of food and how it is referred to in different areas of France was very valuable to me because I am a fussy eater and Steves' book gave me the tool to identify what type of food is being offered on a menu. This was only a tiny but important (to me) part of his book. It also contains a lot of down-to-earth information to help the average American tourist enjoy this French city. I also purchased the map called Streetwise Paris and Rick Steves' French Phrase Book and Dictionary.
2,Not what I expected,"This is a good book if you want to know some the areas to walk and view great historical sites as well as getting the most out of the big museums, but it really lacks the practical things that I really wanted to know such as the best hotels, resturants, and key sites to visit. Don't bother if you want to know about the best resturants and great places to stay. This isn't the book for you. I recommend Frommer's guide. I had limited room in my luggage and a short time in Paris so I actually left Rick Steves' Paris at home."
1,reject,The content of this book was fine. However the pages were not properly cut during the assemby process so the pages were slanted & some of the text was not complete.
2,Junk,"Save your money. These speakers are junk. Mine are sitting in the shed in a box.Get Kickers, they will sound alot better."
2,Appears to be processed salt,I inquired with the seller if this salt was unprocessed sea salt and they had no clue. I was very disappointed but should have known it was processed by the whiteness of the product. Unprocessed sea salt retains all the natural occuring minerals from the sea which is why it appears speckled and beige (gray if Celtic). However when it get processed those sea minerals that gives it that speckling effect are stripped away making it no different than the mineral empty table salt you find on most grocer shelves for 30 cents.
2,confusing,Maybe I just don't have enough patience. Couldn't begin to get into it. It went to the second hand book store.
5,Great Book,Very imformative....great refence for the future when I have insurance questions. Great guidance. Easy read. Would recommend it to anyone.
1,Part of the Information is Misleading,"As an academic researcher in the individual health insurance market, I have found some information of this book is misleading. So, be cautious if you want to use this book to guide your insurance shopping!"
5,Timely information,"As a healthcare professional, I was very interested to read Paul Pilzer's new book. He is right on the money. Most American's do not know the problems that could lie ahead of them when they receive health insurance from their employers. Mr. Pilzer explains in great depth what happens to sick employees who cannot return to work; they eventually loose their jobs and their employer provided insurance, eventually leading to financial ruin for themselves and their families.This is one of the most important and misunderstood points of Mr. Pilzer's book. However, he also talks to the effect of group insurance on healthcare cost increases, how employers can free themselves from this burden, and what pre/post retirees can do to help themselves navigate the complex world of health insurance options for older Americans.Everyone needs to read this book, regardless of age, health or employment status."
4,Just what was needed,The book was described as being in good condition and so it is. Matches the first and third books that we had but were missing the second in the trilogy. Thrilled to have it. Came as promised as well - within 2 days of the first promised date.
5,Great resource!,Elementary Statistics Picturing the world helped me with my statistics homework. I purchased the techology manual with the book and it was a smart choice! Thank you for your prompt delivery also!
5,one of the best time traveler books I have read,This book grabs you right away.. you can't put it down. She is not an evil witch but a good one and the time travel has got a twist to it..I could read this again and again.
1,Nada!,"This is absolute disaster for a video. It was done by amateurs who have the collective brain, when it comes to sound and directing the scenes, of bottom feeding catfish. ( Sorry, catfish!) The whole video was a waste of money."
5,Glencoe Medical Assisting Review,This is truly an outstanding book for anyone who is trying to pass the CMA exam. Dr. Moini has covered all the necessary information that I need to prepare for this exam. I highly recomend this book which has helped me to pass the CMA test with the first attempt. I also would like to thanks the Glenco companyto publish and to make this book available to those who are interested.
5,Excellent review,"This is is an excellent review of what Medical Assistants need to know to pass the CMA and RMA exams. Extremely concise and well written, this book is a must for all who are preparing for the CMA/RMA exam. Don't hesitate, pick up a copy today."
5,This book is really NICE!!!!!,I think this is a good book. I like all the characters and I like how this book is setup. This book is good for all ages. Good classroom book for teachers. I read this book in my reading class. I got into the book really fast and I couldn't put the book down. My favorite character in this book was Sean. He was a nice kid inside and it shows you in the book. At first he seemed like a trouble maker and later he shows you the real him. With a farmers help (Mr. Hassler). I really don't read books. It's not my thing but when I read this one it had me going for another one.
5,A stunning novel!,"I have just completed the book, HERO, moments ago. This stunning novel tells the tale of a boy steaming through adolescance and living a hell of a life. Sean isn't willing to listen to anyone, so he stays past curfew. Again. So begins a story of fear, anger, excitement, and drama in which fifteen year old Sean learns the true meaning of a hero."
1,2 minutes skit strung out to 40 minutes,"This would have worked out .... barely .... as a 2 minute SNL skit. If the actors were intentionally being incompetent then they succeeded glorious but,sadly, not humorously. Not a single laugh. Period. Bad writing, bad acting, sub 1950s special effects. The film is labelled a science fiction parody. But it wasn't. It didn't parody bad science fiction - it was bad science fiction. In fact, awful. If you watch the 2:12 preview on Video On Demand, be aware that you are watching the best acted and funniest part of the movie. From that very low level its all downhill.SeeFirst Contractfor a brilliant, hilarious book length treatment of the same idea. To the extent that the producers of this ... garbage ... were inspired by this author, as is likely, they owe him a profound apology."
5,great fun the kids liked it,"If you love all of the old science fiction movies of the fifties you'll love this show. This show is a good fun take on those old shows, but done in modern day style. The kids liked it and asked ""Where did those aliens learn to drive anyway?"".Some of the green screen and action sequences are done for comedy effect and a bit over the top taking those old 50's sci-fi movies over the edge while staying in character.I recommend ""The Prototypes"" for families and sci-fi fans. Good laughs. I hope the next episode comes out soon!"
3,Interesting... Best for specific interests...,"The documentary is best for students in psychology/sociology. I liked how these voluntary, societal outcasts come back into the U.S. economy as contributive and active members of society (you get to see the in epilogue of who is now doing what).After watching the movie, I agree with a statement made in the documentary that the commune was a place to grow up and learn. It was comforting to know that even when people leave U.S. way of life, they would eventually return as law abiding citizens-- most of the time.The itty-bitty part about the Family International coming in and getting kicked out was really interesting. I found that fascinating at how a predatory/parasitic group sustains itself by brain-washing susceptible, unprotected, unsupervised children.I give it three stars because it is kind of slow with the same footage shown several times in the movie but with a different speaker discussing different subject matter."
1,"No closed captions, dont bother.","This movie was produced fairly recently, in 2005, and surprisingly has NO CLOSED CAPTIONS. It may be informative or silly, uplifting or depressing, illuminating or infuriating-but I'll never know. The producers decided that I and millions of deaf/hearing impaired people like me dont need to see their movie.There is no excuse for not equipping any movie or show with closed captions. NONE. There oughta be a law."
4,What a find...echoes of past and shadows of future,This is a strong and thoughtful documentary with footage from the early days of Black Bear Ranch commune and voices from those who lived it today. Don't miss it. It's a mindful project that has me questioning why we've forgotten the lessons and vision of the past...when things were on the edge of real change.
1,Really bad!,Don't spent money on this old junk! I should have read some better reviews. This is a true waste of time and money!
4,"Intelligent, even handed look at life in a 60s/70s commune","Interesting, insightful look at the Black Bear Ranch Commune, one of the many alternativeliving situations people explored in the late 60s and early 70s.By interviewing a diverse number of members, it gives what feels like a pretty accuratenon-biased view of both the strengths and weaknesses, intelligence and stupidity, braveryand cowardice, generosity and selfishness, openness and didacticism that went into thisrag tag bunch trying to show the world there was another way to live then simply a`consumers' or `employees'.Actor Peter Coyote, who was a member, is particularly articulate about the goals, thesuccesses and the failures. The film also has a sense of humor, which helps. Not alife changing documentary, but certainly an interesting one."
3,Miller's Antiques Encyclopedia,"The pictures are good and colorful, but you need to look up the values in the front."
2,Black and white drawings-Really,"I am just a beginning birder and this book seemed very difficult to use in comparison to the others I have used. The depictions of the birds were separated from the descriptions which meant you had to use two pages to try to be sure for each bird. In addition, some of the depictions were in black and white (not color) and this made it virtually useless for me."
3,"Pictures; too many black and white, too small","Pictures; too many black and white, too smallOtherwise it seems adequate. But, next time I'll go for another larger book."
2,plates are poor,"I am returning this book because the pictures are half in black and white, half in color,and most of the pictures are very small. On the color plates the color is so poor that I can't even recognize birds I already know."
2,Buy birds of the west indies,"This plates are old, ugly. Except the PR parrot and tody which have there own page.Birds of the west indies has much better plates but they aint picture perfect either.This book has more information about the birds although it can be a little outdated.Time for a major revision I would say."
5,excellent,I drink this green tea by Yamamotoyama for almost three years already. I am impressed by the quality and the taste. Highly recommended
4,Highly recommended...,"I will try this based on the number of recommendations.Here is some research on green tea, and its effect on cancer cells:[...]"
5,Fantastic!,"Yamamotoyama Green Tea was given to me by a friend when I was trying to ween myself off coffee and I've been drinking it ever since! It's got a slightly heavy, distinct flavor that's hard to describe, but as many other people say, it is extremely smooth. I generally have it with a little honey and it's great. I've also found that when I drink a cup after I eat it helps my (very fickle) stomach lol! Try it and you will most definitely be hooked. ;)"
2,Surprising Flavor!,"This brand of green tea no where in taste like the wonderful and refreshing flavor I've tasted in many Asian restaurants. There is nothing fragrant or enjoyable about this tea...the strange, dull flavor is indescribable. I'm going back to my Bigelow faves. What a wasted purchase!"
1,Beware !!,"The box has Japanese written on it, but this tea is actually made in China, not Japan.Be aware of the pesticide residue in all Chinese agricultural products, especially tea leaves."
1,Undrinkable in my opinion.,"Not good. Heard many good things about Yamamotoyama. Maybe their higher end tea lines are much better, but this one is not. It is so bad, that I will not even give their other products a shot. Too bad, because I drink a lot of tea."
4,Exceptional Sound,I first came across this item on a friend's superior sound system. It has a real natural warmth that should especially appeal to audiophiles as well as general fans of early music.
4,Excellent product and value,"The Pacer 21105 tailgate protector does exactly what it's supposed to do - protect the edge of your tailgate. My camper top door was rubbing on the originally unprotected tailgate, wearing the paint away and causing the tailgate to rust. I cleaned up and painted the rusty tailgate first, then installation of this product was simple. The camper top door now rests on the rubber guard when closed, no more wear on the tailgate. Product has only been on for a couple weeks so I can't comment on longevity - it's held in place by adhesive that's pre-applied to the rubber, so that could potentially be a weak spot. Overall, I like it!"
1,Terrible! Wasted money!,"These CD-R's are BAD!The metal foil, which all the information is written on falls from the plastic after 1 month of storage indoors.I used them to back-up my pictures and thanks god I left the originals on my PC, instead of deleting them - that saved my pictures!Now I'll run away of any Imation media!!!Don't do the same mystake like me - go for Verbatim or Memorex!"
1,The worst GPS on market,"The GPS totally ruined JVC's reputations. I bought one and returned after few hours. The reception is very poor, cannot pick up the signal for a long time. I don't bother to try other functions, like video and photo since it should be a GPS first. Cannot compete with the leading brand like Tomtom or Nextar - When nextar pick up 10 chanels at my home, the JVC could not fined the location (need 3 satelite to pin point a position).Not recommended."
3,Acid Burns,"This is one of the odder birds in the Ramones' discography. From a band known for its stellar covers, an album of nothing but. It's a great idea that doesn't always hit the target. For example, Jan and Dean's ""Surf City"" is the kind of beach-rock that would have fit inRamonesorLeave Home, and it definitely belongs here. But Bob Dylan's ""My Back Pages"" just doesn't transfer into the punk format.There are some wonderful inspirational moments here (Pete Townshend's yelping on ""Substitute"" alone is worth having this CD), just not enough. Bonus points are added for having Traci Lords singing some backups! ""Acid Eaters"" serves as a reminder to who The Ramones had their radio ears plugged into during their growing years, but is otherwise for completists only.Now if we could only get a compilation CD of all the various covers from their entire career!!!!! If you are merely curious, getLoud, Fast Ramones: Their Toughest Hits."
5,After Capitalism: Prout's Vision for a New World,"If you have any empathy for humanity, this is a must read, Great social leaders around the world are seeing the dynamic social structures of P. R. Sarkar. They are clearly laid out here. Dada Maheshvarananda concisely describes the future social dynamics that humanity will follow, in a neo-(new) humanistic atmosphere, that will follow the downfall of capitalism. Read it now. R. Bates author of "" The Internal Being, Reincarnative and Intuitional Psychology""..."
2,No New Information Here...,"Addressed to the Baby Boomer generation--yes that's me--with absolutely beautiful photography. The great photos are the strength of the book. A nice slant from one Baby Boomer to another, it reads like a story. However, if one is looking for information on any dolls other than the most popular of the day, then you won't find it here. My copy of this book does not include a Price Guide either, as suggested in the photo here. No mention of prices anywhere in the book--for buyers or sellers."
3,Reference for learning,"Photos are great, but the book is short on information. The most popular dolls are there, but I was really interested in the clothing of the period, which there was not much of. The book left me short in teaching my students and antiquechild.com a full picture of the Baby Boomer dolls."
5,Greatest Video EVER,"If you don't like this video, you should never be allowed to view a hockey game ever again. This is hands down the best work ever on VHS and that includes all genres of film. Hockey's Greatest Hits epitomizes the style of hard nosed hockey that made the 80's and early 90's the heyday of the NHL. Thanks to guys like Gary Bettman and Mario Lemieux professional hockey will never again be as great as it was when this video was made. Get it, and don't ever forget how great it is."
4,I love it!!,"I love this necklace. I purchased this for a great price. The chain is strong, the pendant is great. There is one small flaw on one side of it. It is not smooth like it should be. However, I do not wear it so that side shows and I love it! :)"
4,Making Birdhouses-The Ultimate Little Bird-Lover's Handbook.,"What a fun little book. It's full of decorative ideas for your garden, as well as for your little bird friends. Besides the ""thatched flint cottage"" and the ""folk art titmouse box"" birdhouses, there are plans for a rustic feeder and and a very pretty copper bird bath. Plus a whole lot more. The only thing I didn't like about this book was that these creations are put together with a hot glue gun. While, this is simple enought to over come (if you can squeeze the trigger on a glue gun...you can probably squeeze out a little water proof glue and tack in a small finishing nail or two.) Most of the designs are not very complicated. This little book is defininitely worth every penny of the small price."
3,Decent little book,"I've seen larger books with more plans, but this book does a pretty good job covering different houses and construction techniques. I wish it were a bit larger, covering different bird types, but, as an idea starter, was pretty good. I'm not into expensive finishing, so most of mine stop short of the touchy/feely bird home designs covered in the book. From this book and other designs found on the internet, I have been able to build several successful bird houses of my own design. I have also passed on the plan for building a glass bird feeder...still waiting for that one to come back to me as a gift."
5,Fantastic book,"Anyone interested in feminism or capitalist critique should read this book! It is very academic, which may seem dry to some but I found it fascinating and I am very impressed with how well researched it is."
5,Classic Pot-Boiler without any slick shortcuts,"Confused by the basic concept of a limit? Just memorizing stuff to get through calculus, and wondering what it is really all about? This book, referred to as an ""old pot-boiler"" by one of its authors (Torrance)was written back before calculus was a required course. It actually explains the basic concepts, and takes time to build the theory from the ground up. Burrington and Torrance did such a careful job with the concepts, without skipping steps, or substituting slick shortcuts, that it was used for a couple of decades as an alternate text after newer texts were written. After all, any calculus text that stayed in print for over 25 years can't be all bad !! The book is also of interest to anyone concerned with the history of scientific ideas, or the history of the teaching of higher math.Disclaimer: reviewer is the daughter of one of the authors."
2,Directionless and Disappointing,"I watched this movie with high expectations in mind mainly because of the highly acclaimed director, the casting (especially Natalie Portman), and genre. However, I was disappointed as this seemed to be a surreal, directionless look at 18th century(and beginning of 19th) Spain. Each scene was stunningly beautiful to gaze upon, but it flip-flopped between ideas and the focus seemed to shift every 10 minutes or so.Bottom line, it is sloppy and seemed to be missing important plot points."
4,Goya's Ghosts,"Natalie Portman was wonderful! She played two parts in the movie. Very interesting portrayal of Goya with the backdrop of the Spanish Inquistion! I would recommend movie to serious movie lovers, very deep film. Javier Bardem was amazing! Thought he was going to be Goya but he was not. Got the movie just to see his performance!"
3,Very Good Film,"I happen to think this movie is very good, not great but still worth watching. It was refreshing to see Natalie Portman in such a different role than what I'm use to seeing her in. I thought everyone involved did a very good job and I thorougly enjoyed the film. I found it very educational and very personal since my paternal grandparents were Spanish immigrants and perhaps also our ancestors were forced to convert to Christianity in order to save their lives."
2,A missed opportunity,"This film is an example of one of those can't miss projects that somehow just fell apart. A dream cast, a great director, a brilliant subject - all failing to click in the saddest of ways. I so wanted this to be another great Forman epic like Amadeus , Larry Flynt or Cuckoo's Nest. But while it has all the expected beauty and panache that one expects from Forman, finally one has to admit that it's a noble failure. (But let's be honest, any Milos Forman film, even the failures, are better than 95% of what hits American multiplexes these days.)Don't expect much and you will be pleasantly surprised."
1,Poor quality item,DVD wouldn't play due to minute scratches / didn't return it due to cost of postage nearly equal to price of the used DVD.
4,Interesting story; weak resolution,"Some spoilers later:This story is not so much about the artist Goya as it is about some other people in his life during the late 18th and early 19th centuries: an innocent woman condemned by the Inquisition and imprisoned for years; and a monk who impregnates her, then flees and leads a secular life, not knowing where their daughter is.The cast members do an admirable job with some unpleasant scenes--and I will admit to fast-forwarding through the two torture scenes--although I don't know if I completely buy Portman or Skarsgard in the roles of Spaniards. Javier Bardem, by contrast, is perfectly suited to the task.The resolution leaves something to be desired. Portman still doesn't get to locate her daughter and has lost her mind as well; while Bardem is dead and Goya...well, who knows?"
4,History through art,"Forman takes a perspective of history in Goya's Ghosts that could be applied to anytime and any place. Using the characters of Inez, Lorenzo and Goya who observes them both, Forman demonstrates the cruelty and absurdity of mass hysteria, brutal war and the assumption of unrestrained power. Inez is an innocent metaphor for artistic vision and Lorenzo a portrayal of fanaticism. Watching them both is Goya, unable to rescue anyone in a world gone mad with violence in the name of right. Observing the tragedy of Inez and the blindness of Lorenzo (given a taste of his own cruel medicine over a dining table)reveals to us what would have driven Goya to paint the images of Saturn devouring his children in his later life. Important for its portrayal of these historical events, the film is not pretty to watch, or uplifting, but sobering and thought provoking. With solid performances from the principles, Natalie Portman, once again, proves her weight. Excellent production values."
4,Terrific Movie,"At long last, a truly beautiful film about art, history and the people who lived at the time.The sets are beautifully done and are as close to Goya's sketches as possible. Also, an extremely fine cast.One caution: if you like Thomas Kinkade's paintings, you will not like this film as Goya's work is neither pretty nor soothing. Having lived through the Inquisition, the French Revolution and later, his sketch pad was his camera and torture and death were some of the main subjects.However, if you want to see 18th century history in Spain through an artist's eyes, the movie was wonderful."
2,What went wrong with this movie?,"I kept thinking this was supposed to be a great movie. The performances are wonderful; the settings are sumptuous and astonishingly beautiful. But the story?? Was anyone watching?At the beginning of the movie, it seems that Goya himself is in trouble with the Inquisition for the prints from his ""dark period."" But nothing comes of it. It is never made clear why the beautiful young girl is really singled out for torture and permanent imprisonment. If it is hinted that she is intended to implicate someone else, it never happens. When the beautiful young girl is released from prison and is found by Goya, why does she never clean up? Stringy hair until the end.Many of the same problems as ""Barry Lyndon.""Sure. Watch ""Goya's Ghosts."" Sit back and enjoy the beauty; just don't try to figure it out."
4,I would watch it again.,"Great movie depicting the horrors of the inquisitions of the Roman catholic church; hard to verify specific events historically, so it must be kept in mind that this is a fictional account, that very likely had paralleled a real event not recorded.The movie, if nothing else, makes a case for what happens when religious power has access to unchecked civil control."
4,Goya's Ghost,I really liked Goya's Ghost as I learned some insight of the Artist's life. It was a good period piece with suspense and drama in the storyline. I consider it a good film but not a great one. It was worth the price of the DVD.
3,Horrible ending,Movie was great until it got to the end and it just leaves you hanging........wondering what happens to several characters. A little disappointing.
5,Very enjoyable... a MUST have for NFL fans,"I would just like to say that this DVD is one of the most enjoyable and addictive sports DVDs I have. Relive the beginnings of the Superbowl. Experience the feelings of past glory and see all-time greats play again. For me, growing up in the 80s and 90s it was good to be able to see Joe Montana winning the Superbowl for the 49ers again; the back-to-back wins for the unstoppable Cowboys lead by Troy Aikman; the struggles of John Elway and the Broncos; the winning streak of Brady and the Patriots; and the reign of the Steelers.This is a MUST DVD for Superbowl and football fans. For those of you who can't keep track of how many Superbowl (if any) a team have won in the past... get this DVD. And for the price that it's selling for... need I say more?"
2,Skip it!,"Skip it, wait until ESPN shows the Super Bowl moments. You only get about 2-3 minutes of highlights per Super Bowl. If you blink, you may miss a year or two."
3,themeatnpotatoesofitall,"interesting, well thought out Sci-Fi short story thinkers..would have gave it more stars though a found my self disconnected with the topics at hand because some of the characters were either just too dweeby, shallow or to (fake) Gung-HO (macho)..it is good to have some people give you input on your military scenes that were actually in the service it would'nt have hurt. I have'nt watched all of the stories, once I am done I will return and adjust my review..not to bad so far, as I said interesting..I shall return.."
2,Was that science fiction?,"This may be good viewing for somebody who never reads science fiction.As a person who reads sci-fi endlessly, and as a collector of sci-fi movies and television series, I have to say I was disappointed with this one. Perhaps the target audience is younger than myself and is a group that does not want to spend time thinking about... erm... anything in particular.If the authors are in fact masters of science fiction, I would suggest that maybe they are not masters of television screen writing."
2,You have to be easily entertained to like this garbage.,"Thank god they took this off the air. I bought this DVD without ever having seen the series before. It's terrible. 4/6 episodes are just completely worthless. Two are decent, including the one based on a Heinlein story. Let me say it this way: Stephen Hawking is the host. WTF? Why would you have a guy who can't talk as a host??? This show was poorly made from the beginning."
2,Middle of the road,"Few Science Fiction movies avoid the perceived pressures of the popular. By contemporary standards Solaris, Ikarie XB1 and 2001 a space odyssey are some of the few exceptions and TV generally fairs no better. The glaring exception of course is The Prisoner but more often the insertion of action scenes or horror is perceived to cover all bases. Therein lies the problem. This collection is rife with this kind of pandering. After the first story, A Clean Escape, (which holds up the best), the series descends into a fest of clichés. If you like Steven King of Ray Bradbury, you might find something of interest here, but for me it is a dull parade of mediocrity despite some Hollywood names."
2,The Better Title Would Be The 'Amateurs Of Science Fiction',"I'll admit it--I'm not a fan of sci-fi. Other than Star Wars and Star Trek and that new FOX television show ""Fringe,"" anything related to science fiction just sorta freaks me out. But my wife Christine, on the other hand, it one bona fide sci-fi nut! If it's strange and kooky with aliens or parallel universes involved, then she is watching it. Her eyes won't come off of the Sci-Fi Channel. So I got this DVD series for her to watch thinking it would be right up her alley. Ummmmm, NOPE! She hated it and said it wasn't authentic sci-fi to her. Sure, there were a few good moments here and there, but most of it was extremely disappointing. Too bad! Describing something as ""masters"" raised the expectation level too high. How about renaming this the ""Amateurs Of Science Fiction"" instead?"
3,Hit and Miss,"This series was a bit of a mixed bag for my tastes. The episodes that I liked, I really enjoyed. The rest, I didn't care much for at all.My favorites in the set were the more off-beat episodes, such as ""Jerry Was a Man"" and ""The Discarded."" These episodes stand out from the set both because they are visually-appealing, and they don't feel as ""preachy"" as some of the other episodes. ""Jerry Was a Man"" actually has quite a few humorous moments, which was a nice reprieve from the bleak tone of many of the other episodes. I don't have a problem with science fiction that is political in nature, but I would have liked the series to explore the wide variety of the genre. Unfortunately, the series didn't last long enough for this kind of exploration.Although the production values were decent and there are some wonderful performances here, I most likely will not watch these DVDs again."
2,It was just..,I was expecting more and not a low budget thing. I found it boring so I gave it to a mgr at work if that tells you anything. The info was bla..
2,Not as good as it could have been,"Some of the stories could have been better concidering the writers. It is still a good collection to add to a Sci-fi library, to be viewed again."
3,too loud and the silent alternative,"The fan noise was unbearable. For those concerned about the white noise created by the fan, try the fanless GeForce 8600GT from Gigabyte. I did and I am very happy with it. The only disadvantage to the Gigabyte card is that my case stays about two degrees hotter under load than when I was using the XFX card. Both the cards make HDTV look really nice. Try googling for ""silent computing"" if you are really bothered by noise. The XFX card is not for you if you are bothered by noise.GIGABYTE GV-NX86T256H 8600GT 256MB 128BIT DDRIII PCIE DVI-I D-SUB HDTV TV OUT"
1,Really shouldn't blow up,"I had my XFX 8600 for almost exactly a year and a half. Nowhere included in the box or on the box was any notice of warranty, nor was there any notice on or in the box that one must registered on-line in order to extend the warranty beyond the original warranty period of 1-year.Two of the capacitors on my card exploded one afternoon, and brought my system to a screeching halt. I would not recommend this video card at even a quarter the price."
5,great value,"Not the best card that cost 4 times more out there, but upgraded from 6800 to 8600 is heaven. I added one G bit of ram the same time; the result is excellent!"
5,Tremenda!!!,"Esta tarjeta es la mejor que puedes conseguir por esta cantidad de dinero, no tengo una pc muy potente, pero con esta tarjeta he podido jugar varios actuales con una calidad grafica que nunca pude haber imaginado en mi PC."
2,Loud Card,The card is very loud. It completely dominates any other fans inside the case. I am looking at replacing the fan.
5,very great deal,"Hi, this is very very great deal, I bought two items at the same time the XFX GeForce 8600GT 256MB 620Mhz with free game and OCZ 2GB PC2-6400, by recommendatin from Amazon.Until now I didn't try both of the items, but I know the result will be great.thanks AmazonAnas"
2,Not working,"I returned this item because it's not working with my Shuttle XPC SD31P and ViewSonic VX2825wm. I also tried a different PC (with Asus P5M,Pentium D, 2GB RAM) on the same monitor and I encountered the same problem. Nvidia control panel is reporting higher than 1920x1200 res, which causes the edges to be displayed outside the normal res i.e. you can only see half of Start Bar. XFX online support said this might be a video card memory defect."
1,Be Forewarned!!!,"This card is made with subpar components, the fan is very noisy + sneaky warranty tactics are used by the manufacturer!I had the card for alittle over two years when some of the capacitors blew. Come to find out the capacitors are well known for their poor quality. I thought that I would be able to get a replacement card because of the lifetime warranty. But technical support told me that the card needed to be registered within 30 days of purchase for it to have the lifetime warranty. I was not informed of that at the time of purchase."
4,Good card. A little underpowered for current games,"I've had two of these cards SLI'd for about 3 years. Although they held up for a bit, they are currently underpowered for today's games. SLI support has gotten better over time but still has some hiccups from time to time. For classic gaming and normal computing this card is good but if you want to play modern/new games, look elsewhere."
2,"Nice card, bad quality components","Owned the card for two years, no games. As soon as I started gaming like a month ago 3 capacitors blew up. It was pretty nice while it worked. I hear you can replace them and they are very cheap. But as of today you would be better off buying a 9600 gt but beware of XFX using those cheap capacitors. In a forum, I found my exact same problem happened to someone else... exactly the same 3 FZ capacitors."
2,"Loud. Really, really loud.","While the 8600GT itself performs very well, next time I'm avoiding XFX and spending a little more. Why? The fan on this card is so amazingly loud. I've been building my own computers for 15 years and have owned plenty of video cards with fans, but this one takes the cake. I can hear it from the room next door. I have to turn it off at night to get sleep. Now I'm looking at another $25-$30 for an aftermarket cooler (which XFX support suggests). I should have paid the extra money up from for another card and saved myself the hassle."
2,Are you serious???,"Would you honestly buy this for that much??? That is way overpriced for a 256MB GPU you can find a gig of that for that price or cheaper. Don't read the ""good"" reviews those are just those people posting to make money from some company."
5,"Great Card, Great Price.",I have never had and issue with the card and it runs all games and apps I have without a hiccup.
4,Hmmm ..... You search good hardware at lower cost?,"In truth is a great technology, the performance is excellent, the capacity of graphic deployment is high, the cost is low in comparison of benefices and has good options of expansion."
3,Ho Hum,I was not impressed with this video card. I really wanted a card that could handle Stalker: Shadow of Chernobyl with Full Dynamic Lighting at 1440x900 resolution on Windows XP. This card is not it. Odd graphical hiccups plagued the screen during lightning storms and the game ran slower than a disabled sloth on tranquilizers. I returned this card and bought a EVGA GeForce 8800 GTS. More than twice as fast and I am very satisfied with it.
1,A Dreadful book,"My abusive ex husband gave me this little nightmare in order to encourage me to be more vapid and submissive for him ( hint.. though the title suggests it, this book is *not* pro-woman ). Amoung other things, it suggests that husbands keep their wives on a ""choke chain"" and that having a career is only something woman with poor self esteem do, because they feel ""threatened"" by Barbie Dolls like Ms. Bird. Lying is encouraged, and negotating is out. Honesty does not figure in Ms. Bird's world, intelligent woman are held in contempt. Kind men are ""weak"".This horrible book ended up in trash can, and after my ex did other various awful, illegal things to others smaller and weaker than himself I will not get into here, we divorced.Whenever I see this book, I am reminded of the destructive mind set of the man who wants a woman to act like this, and wonder why another woman would encourage it."
3,Missing Judy,"Missing Judy is a tense, gripping thriller as it uncovers the mysterious happpenings of the day Kim's little sister Judy disappears. Although at times it can be hard to get into, it is a thoroughly enjoyable book and captures the reader at times. I have given it three stars, because although I enjoyed it, it is not a book I will remember reading or read again in future."
5,excelent,a great book about jewish stories and excelent to share with your children. a great way to incoorperate ones faith into a story you can share with your child
2,Product not as advertised,"I purchased this filter from ""Allergy Be Gone"" via Amazon. It was advertised as ""Genuine Honeywell True HEPA filter"" but when the product arrived it was clearly made by some other company than Honeywell. And it is not of the same quality as the Honeywell HEPA filter (the Honeywell has soft rubber gaskets while the one that I received has hard plastic gaskets which makes it harder to seal the filter in the unit)."
2,False advertising on an ok product...,"THIS FILTER IS NOT MADE BY HONEYWELL!!! THIS IS AN AFTERMARKET FILTER!!!Keeping that in mind, the filter is ok. I have no way of determining if the filter is better or worse than the Honeywell one. Buyer Beware!"
1,6 months waiting period,I received total 3 email from Amazon for delay approval since I placed the order in Oct. 2004. I finally canceled my order in Feb. 2005.
3,Indifference,"As a long term auto enthusiast, I like to build my library with new and innovative books. Unfortunately, After getting into the book, it bacame disappointing. The book is large and beautifully presented but it became boring for me. The pictures were all in a similar setting (on the salt flats) with no other inside, engine, etc. views. The cars presented had the majority of them being Ford deuces. Hey - it's old. I also felt cheated by the narrative as it wasn't what I liked. That is, Peter goes into superficial feelings and lame interviews. I would have loved to have some side bar specs on the cars, etc. I relaize that Peter is a photographer yet for me the combo of photography and a cars specs are what makes the meal complete. Hence, I could not give it more than an average grade."
1,PISSED OFF,"All I recieved from you was a e-mail telling me these books were ""undeliverable"". Then you told me I would be reinbursed. This was a birthday gift certificate from my daughter. I now have no books, no $50.00!! I will never do business with you people again. Just send me my books or the $50.00. That is alot of money to people like us who are living on a fixed income. (And you have the nerve to ask me for a review!!!)"
2,Didn't Git-R-Done,Larry had some funny sceans and one liners but the film itself was not good enough to hold your attention. Boaring.
3,Not bad for redneck humor,"I met Larry at the show where ""Git R Done"" was taped. Nice guy. His humor is straight from redneck country. If you don't like that sort of humor, you shouldn't expect much here.After I adjusted to his humor, I found him funny. Very funny. Toilet humor, but funny. Lots of jokes about reproductive type stuff, or bathroom activities.Would I recommend this for my 14 year old daughter? Too late. She enjoys it, even if I would have prefered to shield her from that sort of ""entertainment"".Fun is poked at many groups that are ""off limits"" these days. It's old fashioned humor, picking on people based on stereotypes. No one is off limits for Larry. It's refreshing, hearing truly funny stuff without worrying about political correctness. Don't like it? Don't watch it. It's that simple.Overall, this is a fun show."
1,Larry the cable guy - git-r-done,"Not of the same caliber as the Blue Collar Gang. Language much too rough for children to hear. I enjoyed his part in the Blue Collar Gang presentations but, did not enjoy this one. I do not reccommend this DVD"
4,Yankees? It was filmed in Kalamazoo Michigan,"Come on folks, quit with the yankee bull. It was filmed in Michigan. Not his best, but he is still damn good. If you are uptight then just don't watch it."
3,Git R' Done!,"Larry the Cable Guy and his southern redneck stand-up comedy shtick is very funny, mostly. This DVD features Larry in a 66-minute stand-up monologue, which is much edgier and little more vulgar in parts than his act in The Blue Collar Comedy Tour. There's a lot of juvenile bathroom humor - especially about flatulence. And Larry pokes a lot of fun at people with disabilities. If you are easily offended by these things this video is not for you! Myself, I found it most of it laugh out loud funny although there are some moments that aren't so funny. Also, I'd already seen some the material in the Blue Collar Comedy Tour videos.The extra features were stupid frankly. There's a short skit called ""Bathroom Humor"" which was not funny and then a bunch of silly pictures of Larry.But overall I would give this DVD a thumbs up because it makes you laugh and is something you can watch multiple times and still enjoy it."
4,Holy Moly!,"Indeed, this performance's opening statement says it all: ""Ladies and Gentlemen: please welcome the man who should be the next president of the USA: Larry the...""He really should be!Larry's seemingly slow-witted ""where the hell is my neck'o'the woods"" kinda humour, may seem offensive and rude sometimes, but it sure is funny! If the next guy would use some of the language the way Larry does...he would probably be scorched for it.Not Larry, he has a way of making it all sound as if it happened to him, being the dumbest thing next to a monkey's a**, and not having a clue about that...But underneath that 'dumb-a** redneck'-appearance is a keen sence of observation and an uncanny feel for 'pointe' and timing...pointing to an above average intelligence!The one thing that makes me substract a star is not the content...but a technical thing: Why does only America get to enjoy this? This should be a No-region code DVD!"
4,Funny stuff,Even after already seeing this before it was still funny. Larry the cable guy is a funny guy that is a true artist.
2,A bit over the top...,"My sister's finance loves Larry the Cable guy and got this movie for Christmas. Glad I was not the one who bought it for him--but, he loves it--I personally found it weak. The jokes were crude and I hated the fact that he kept pushing how good of a Christan he was but then he backtracked on that with the next line. I am not into pushing of religion in the first place and feel that his method is one of the reasons we have problems with other people's religion and personal lives. I just am not a fan of Larry the Cable guy. And this may influence my low score but I feel you should try and watch it before you buy it."
1,Shocked,"For years I've enjoyed Larry the Cable Guy. He was my favorite part of Blue Collar. I finally bought Git-R-Done and could not believe my ears!!! He was VERY offensive! I was really shocked to hear him making fun of the mentally challenged, the handicapped, small people, God, prayers, etc. His material was totally NOT politically correct in what he called these groups of people. It's one thing to make fun of stupid people and rednecks and life. But to attack people who can not help who they are is just rude. I still love Larry with Blue Collar, though. And Ron White..put down your drink and cigarette for 5 minutes and sober up!! Maybe I'm too sensitive. Be nice, Larry!"
1,Offensive...,"This was maybe the most offensive thing I've seen in a long while. Ignoring the obvious racist and homophobic lines, the humor was more on a 13-year-old's level than an adult's. If you're into fart jokes and making fun of the disabled, you will enjoy it. Nevermind the annoying repetition of ""git 'er done,"" and ""Lord forgive me...""One thing that bugs me: How does a man so obviously overweight make so many fat jokes? I guess he's a man, so he's allowed to be husky."
1,Not up to AllClad quality,Ordered as a gift and didn't even unwrap the tools. The case was dinged and the handle broken off and loose in the box. Way to low quality to be given as a high end gift. A piece of garbage.
2,Not up to All-Clad quality,"I love All-Clad products usually, but this set does not live up to their reputation. The brush hair constantly comes off. Nothing is more disgusting that getting a thick brush hair in your food. It happens everytime I used this set. You can simply tug a little on the brush hairs and it always releases into your hand. Bad quality product."
3,Great toy,This is a great toy. It isn't strong enough for hunting but is good for learning to shoot bows. Although the bow is great the quiver is pretty useless and it doesn't have enough arrows.
1,Its not what's shown here.,"The picture for this product shows a nice compound bow. If you read the fine print is a simple bow that's only about 28"" long. I could have bought the same thing at target for <$25. Complete rip-off."
1,Dissatisfied,This bow is a toy not worth the shipping and handling must less the price if you are looking for a real bow. It will not launch the arrow more than a few feet unless you shoot it upwards at a sharp angle. If shot at a target at 10' or less it just bounces off. Very dissappointed when my 9 yr. old son shot it. Cable came out of pully's on 3rd shot. Would not recommend this bow.Sharpshooter Bow and Arrow Set
1,"Sharp Shooter not very ""sharp""","I got this set for my kids (9 & 7) who had shot arrows at Cub Scout camp. This set is a complete waste of money. An arrow shot from this bow has a maximum range of no more than 15 feet. At that distance the arrow will sometimes penatrate a cardboard target. An ""arrow holder"" attached to the bow lasted for about 3 or 4 arrows before it fell off. I wanted to give my kids an archery set that they could practice with and instead got junk. I would have done better finding an old stick and a shoe string. Don't waste your time and money with this set."
1,Just awful,I love the 10 minute solution dvds usually but this one is just awful. The instructor goes way too fast and barely demonstrates the moves. The moves also change rapidly. I think one of the things that bugged me most is the instructor's incessant fast talking. She never stops. And like another reviewer stated I didn't feel any real work out. The flirty workout is actually more stripperish than flirty. My recommendation is to stick with Jennifer Gilardi and Kristin Jacobs--they are really good instructors and you get a good workout. I hope they do more 10 minute dvds.I am adding an addendum--the last two workouts (Swing and Ballet) on the dvd are actually good and finally got me breathing which makes me feel better though I am glad I didn't pay anywhere near full price for this.
5,10 Minutes Well Spent,She teaches dance moves while incorporating a good workout. It is time well spent. I would definitely recommend this workout.
3,ended up at the doctor,"I'm a huge fan of the 10 minute videos. But after doing this one once, it blew a blood vessel in my foot, caused it to swell up, and it's purple. I ended up at the doctor where he said I ""traumatized the heck out of it"". I didn't think it was that bad while doing it but apparently something didn't like me - I suspect the ballet part. Love the other 10 minute DVDs I've tried though."
2,"Good moves, really bad music","I forgot that the 10 minute solution series have really cheesy music, it so bad that I really don't use this DVD. The instructor is good, her moves are interesting and fun but the music just ruins it for me. If generic 80's synth music doesn't bother you then you may dig this DVD."
1,You call that a workout??!,"OK, background first- I am 40 & not exactly in the best shape of my life. Halfway through the workouts I am still breathing normally. If you're gonna burn fat in 10 minutes, you gotta do interval training, & this is just 10 minutes of basic cardio. Not what I expect from 10 Minute Solution. Disappointing. Recommend Keli Roberts & the original 10 Minute Solution."
2,Just okay,"I was excited to try this as a few reviews were fairly positive. I put the DVD in the player and all of a sudden this Paris Hilton wannabe stands in front of the camera posing for every syllable. It was difficult to take and going further than that would have been cruel torture as this gal doesn't have much of a personality that seems genuine. She is a good dancer, I'll give her that and keeping up was difficult, but that is only because I am not a dancer. I am sure somebody could get a lot out of this DVD if they can get past her and the personality that she was trying to portray. All I know is, for me, in my opinion, I can tell if somebody is really wanting to make a difference in the lives of the viewer by getting them into shape and/or lose weight or if they are just in it to make a buck and stand there looking pretty for the camera. If it's not real and genuine, it's not for me."
2,Overlook the wardrobe and dance!,"OK -- I admit it. I'm playing fashion police. This otherwise excellent dance workout DVD suffers because of a MAJOR bactarian wardrobe issue in the first workout segment. Other than that (and I find it difficult to get past) the workouts are fun, short, and not too difficult. Workouts 2-5 are good, and I do not find it difficult to watch the leader in those. So, if you are OCD about certain fashion issues, get the DVD and skip the first segment."
5,Fantastic Reel!,"This is one of the best reels I have used. Like it as much as my Penn 975, if not more. The 975 may not be as high quality, but I just love it. The Calcutta is a much more heavy duty setup, and a bit more smooth too. Can't go wrong with this model..."
2,"good, if and should it last...","as said, the gun i got came with a slight flaw, because the pull-back on one gun came split, I had to tape it together to keep it on, and that worked for about two weeks. one, when fired with the wind, vered to the left. the other (the one that had a faulty slide) fired slow. but i found this feature cool: i was able to load up to five shots into the barrel for a sluggish ""shotgun effect"". these are good wile they last, and are cool if you don't want to spend somewhere around $1,000 for a james bond gun to show off in a huge gun case of gun modles from spy mivies(like an aquantance of mine). all in all, good for display, bad for performance (why I give it two stars and not one) so, see you in the trenches!"
2,Carnosaur 4,"If you've seen the first three Carnosaur movies, you've seen this one. They take footage from the first three and add a little bit. The first three movies were cheesy fun, this one was just...no."
1,TERRIBLE,"Now I am the one that likes the cheesy movies but this was one of the worst movies ever. It looks like the ""Carnivore movies"" were copied and pasted all over this film scenes and scenarios accept for the people. This movie was too good for Jeff Fahey and Tony Todd they usually do much better movies than this one.. Don't waste the money......"
1,I DON't BELIEVE MY EYES!!!,"Someone in Hollywood must be REALLY desperate to make some money and fast. This film is so silly itis beyond description.For starters, Americans do not know how to do a dinosaur movie. Leave that to the Japanese.For a big star, Jeff Fahrey must have been desperate to lower his standards to have been persuaded to film in such stupidity.A complete waste of time all way around."
2,govan1,"this was a disappointing read after expecting something more.there are too many ""americanisms"" such as ""mom"" and i feel the detail is short and would be better suited to a 2nd form reader at High school. it is such a short book to cover such a massive piece of history, sorry."
5,Love this story,"Boudica is someone that everyone should know about. There is too little known about her and Miss Sosebee's book helps fill in some of the gaps. Although it is only 100 pages, I still recomend it for those that wish to try and understand a certain part of world history that cannot be ignored. Boudica truly was an amazing woman."
1,totally useless,"I don't know what they were thinking when they made this, but it's useless. the ""bar"" is about 1/4"" OD. Nothing will mount to that. And it's all cheap plastic. Not recommended."
1,"Oh, Give me a Break.","This is the kind of metal that defines every stereotype out there. Every song has terribly generic lyrics.....One of the songs starts out with: ""Preparing virgin sacrifice"". Really? Come on now, this kind of metal creates every stereotypical statement ever said about the genre. This band desperately tries to copy Judas Priest, which is funny but it doesn't really work. Shall I start on the singer? Or should I say ""siren of Metal"" as he is called in the booklet, he honestly has the worst voice I have ever heard. I'm not kidding, it sounds like Pee Wee Herman doing metal. I bought this at a used CD store, just for laughs, and thats about all I got.Its funny reading that other positive review here, it sounds like Jack Black wrote it. This is not Power or Prog Metal, its just loud and terrible. That said, its pretty good if you want your parents to have a ""where did we go wrong?"" moment.If you want good metal, skip this swill, and buy ""Scenes From a Memory"" by Dream Theater."
5,Aragorn King of Gondor is awesome!,"Very cool figure, definitely! The articulation is great and the paint job is phenomenal. On other Aragorn figures the face was all wrong but this one rocked! A good investment."
4,Da' King,Very superior detail. Super deal...always love those GREEN deals in the clearance zone. well featured..lifelike facial features. Nice addition if you are collecting LOTR.
2,A Little Short,"This is a great looking figure, but the scale is totally off with all the other LOTR figures. It is TINY. This is a rip-off. I hate it when the toy companies change the size scale during a run of figures."
3,Sparrow novel,I am impressed by Gilmour's work here. He does an excellent job at expressing the emotions one would explain if our heart or the person that we so entwine with our selves leaves us. This novel shows how one person deals with this universally experienced scenario. The shortcoming for me was that there is no completeness to this novel. The novel starts with showing how classy our professor is and it shows his decline into something definitely less than the persona he so cherished about himself. The ending how ever does not really pursue or finish pursue any of the themes raised in the earlier parts of the novel. The professor is just left hanging in the middle of his dilemma.
4,picaresque...........,this book is full of self-created misadventures by a love-sick college professor...i am not sure whether or not it is intentionally humorous but i found it to be hilarious in its bleak blackness...one bad thing after another for this poor self-involved creature...well worth reading....slim and captivating.
2,Very disappointing,"I have bought this recording because of Ambrogio Maestri, whom I know from the TDK's Falstaff. But except for him, as well as the stage and the costumes, this Nabucco is unlistenable. Abigail is just terrible, Zaccaria is very tremulous. When you listen to it, you feel as if he had a lump in his throat. Ismaele's high notes are forced, sung with difficulties and Maestri himself is a bit heavy-footed on the stage. Fenena cannot act. Buy a different Nabucco if you can."
2,Makes my purifier squeek!,"Im sure it probably does what it is supposed to do but I cant run the air purifier when Im in the room. It emits a continuous high frequency squeeking that is VERY annoying! Im sure it is because the tolerences of this replacement are a bit different than the original Honeywell filter. I have tried ""shimming"" the filter as well resetting it (multiple times) all to no avail. My advice, buy the Honeywell filter. This one is...shall we say, problematic."
1,Alert--does not fit in the unit it claims to fit,I have a 50150 model and it says right on the label attached to the bottom of it to buy replacement filter 21500.On the the box that this came in it says it will fit 50150 but this filter was not tall enough for my unit.It was too much trouble to send it back so I ripped the rubber off the top of the old filter and attached it with silicone to this new one. That was enough to get it to fit but I should not have to do that for a 50+ dollar filter.I don't know if this is a one-off problem but I do see I'm the only one with this problem to post a review.
2,But are they HEPA filters?,"I ordered two from Amazon, and received them in apparently good condition from another vendor. They look like the picture on line and fit the machine. But the box said nothing about Honeywell, and there was no packing slip. The product says nothing on it about Honeywell and has no part number or other identifier on it. In the past I have ordered Honeywell pre-filters on Amazon, and been sent generics. The pre-filters were clearly different products and lots of people were complaining in Amazon reviews. These filters I just received could be Hepa filters, or folded coffee filters in frames. Honeywell -- and Amazon -- should be after these guys."
4,Fits other models too,"This filter will also fit model 50150. I searched for a while before I found this filter with the same dimensions as the 50100, 50150, 50250, 50300 series filters. No need to buy two of the smaller filters and stack them if this one is available."
3,Disappointed that shorts don't have pockets to hold balls,"This is my first tennis skirt. I looked at a lot of skirts online and read all the reviews to see if the skirt came with pockets, because that is an important feature for me. I was very disappointed to find out that it does not have a ball pocket. To be fair, the product description didn't specify pockets. But I thought tennis skirts with shorts would generally come with at least one pocket to hold balls, and one reviewer here said it includes a pocket. Otherwise, the skirt fits fine. I got the size M; I usually wear a size 6 or 8, depending on the brand. The Amazon size chart suggested that I would be in between a size S and M, so I opted for the larger size to avoid having a super snug skirt."
5,"Fast, quick, and easy brakes.",I'm very satisfied with this purchase. The brakes came within 2 days as promised and for a cheaper price than most online and local retailers offered.I would definitely buy again.
5,Outstanding,"Simply stated, probably the best versions available. Here you have the piano and orchestral versions combined and for this price it can`t be beat! Clear & finely recorded throughout."
5,the one with the silencer in his hand talks to you,"Yes and he means business. This sequel to the Soft Machine continues to aim at shooting holes in the phoney fabrications of our indoctrinated minds. Before pulling the trigger it chats away with us at random like the friendly policeman, but his sentences don't make sense in the normal way, they're like shreds of human tissue that fall on us like snow: somewhere there must have been an explosion. Before our fearfully closed eyes we see flashes of the fight between the invader and the protectors. But is what is defended worth to behold? The severed phrases turn slowly and with intervals into trancelike asymmetric symphonies of mindturning poetry. An abstract message is communicated. The gun that was pointing at you slips into your hand. A terrible truth."
3,Sunset Western Landscaping Book,"Interesting but not very deep. Good for ideas, then use another reference to research plant choices."
5,Extremely Useful,"I've purchased several landscaping books recently, and this is by far my favorite. There are hundreds of pictures for inspiration, so I often flip through it when I'm feeling bored. The organizational style is very user-friendly, which makes it easy to find ideas for specific landscaping projects. I really like the lists they include of their favorite types of plants for certain settings (broken down by region and specific use). The garden plans are very nice; however, they don't include dimensions, which would be extremely helpful. Overall a very valuable household resource. It also makes an excellent housewarming gift."
3,Ok,Book in great condition but not very good examples for what I was looking for. Great price though. Can't complain that way. Wish it would of had more examples of ways to landscape with water.
2,Get the magazine,"If you get Sunset the magazine, you probably don't need this book. The book has some beautiful pictures of varied landscape types in varied climates and some general planting suggestions (like the magazine). But, also like the magazine, unless you have $50K-$100K lying around, good luck pulling any of these things off. I say get the magazine because you can get the landscaping ideas, seasonally relevant planting suggestions along with some nice recipes, gardening and traveling tips."
4,Very useful,"This book has some really good ideas for gardening and landscaping in the desert. Anyone who lives in the desert knows what a challenge it is to grow a beautiful garden AND be a good steward of the limited, precious resources. The only negative comment is that the garden examples are mostly from California. It would be more helpful to me if there were more examples and discussion on high desert gardening in places like Santa Fe and Albuquerque, New Mexico."
5,California Landscaping Ideas,Great source of ideas for our new home in California. A great number of photos that we intended to incorporate into our landscaping plans.
5,Bob Reade is a master.,This is an excellent book for anybody who is or aspires to be a football coach. Bob Reade shares his methods of coaching that have brought him unbelievable success on and off the field. This is a must read for every coach.
3,Strangely Interesting,"First off this book was written in 1859. Once again 1859, not 1959 or anything remotely close to us. This book is about eating different types of animals. How to eat flying lemurs, horses, and so much more. If taken from a historical perspective this can be interesting. Honestly I found this book a bit difficult to read, as they were talking about eating many endangered animals.The printface remains from its original publishing, so you will not mistake this for a book that was written recently. The book has no illustrations, but is in text only. It is a bit interesting from an acedemic point of view."
5,After,She shares in verse the short glimpses of life. Every time I pick up her book and read another my thoughts echo her words.
3,Classic Alien Conspiracy Film,"This film somewhat resembled the well known show X-Files. The basic plot of the film involved a coterie known as the Puritans. Their mission was to keep Earth safe from the alien threat. However one group member realizes something isn't right, & that's really where the story gets interesting. Overall, not a bad film. It is of course a low budget, and runs just over half an hour. It's biggest downfall was the acting, especially the main character, it was just awful. Luckily it doesn't detract from the story, which kind of has a surreal twang to it. So if you got a half an hour, the film doesn't cost much, so check it out."
5,E520S Digital Camera,"This camera is one of the best in regards to overall high quality images for a 5 MP camera. I owned one in the early 2000's and sold it. I had a chance to get another one and did. The camera is not easy to use. You MUST READ the instructions. If you get a bad pictures, it is not the camera, it is the operator. Distance and Macro shots are crystal clear. It is hard to a new E520S. They are still being produced in New Zealand in limited quantities. I use mine for close ups and in studio shots. A classic. If you have one, hang onto it."
1,A camera not worth buying...,It takes terrible pictures inside. It's even worse outside. Get ready to spend money on batteries because they will constantly run out. I would not recommend spending $10 on this camera.
5,This is my Grandfather!!,"I have not as of yet read the entire book, only excerpts from it, but I am sure that it will be amazing. This incredible story is about my Grandfather, Ed Robb!"
3,"Locations, locations, locations","The book doesn't quite live up to its subtitle: ""The City as Character,"" though the authors do a whole lot of talking about L.A. You have to admire the effort that went into tracking down all these film locations, though many of them (""Present-day tunnel through Bunker Hill where Steve Thomson is dropped of in Criss Cross"") are of the ""so what"" variety. Lots of film stills, but on the whole the book didn't seem worth the price. If you absolutely must have every book connected with noir films, then you might feel differently."
2,concert version,I recently saw a staged version of the damnation en direct from the Met in HD at a local cinema. No comparaison possible! I had to force myself to stay awake listening to the concert version on that cd; I had to hold my breath during the staged version!
4,Amethyst and Diamond hoop earrings,The earrings are dressy but versatile. They seem to be well made. My only concern is the security of the catch. If the catch slips open they will fall right out.
3,Deicent Quality OK for casual dress,This belt will do OK for Docker syle casual/jeans.The weight is of mid weight & of a smooth feel of surface. The illustration of a sheen finish is not the same.This one will do for the Timberland name.But I did expected a little more heft in weight often found in thier products.
1,No Response!!,I ordered the wrong item and I emailed the sender to find out my options for returining the item to get the right one and I still haven't received a response!!! Will not order from them again!!!
2,Work while lasted,"The strips worked great for a year. I was impressed that placing this small strips of rubber can prevent scratches, which is a constant headache since I park my car on streets of New York City.Unfortunately, after about a year the strips began to peal off from the edges. After some rain/snow, the trips completely fell off. The worst is that they leave ugly dirty glue marks on bumper surfaces. Even after cleaning the bumper I still can easily see marks on where the strips used to be. Now I can either (1) stick another trips on the same spot to hide the marks, or (2) have bumper repainted. I think I'll go with (2) and find other type of bumper guards."
3,Paced,don't put this on in cold weather it will not stick fyi found that out the hard way keep in mind
3,Where are these products made?,I have not installed them yet. They look okay however there is not any country of origin on the packaging and my email to the company requesting it is still unanswered. They do however push that the adhesive tape is made by 3M.The product itself looks good and was better than I was expecting other than not knowing where I was spending my dollars; as soon as it gets a little warmer in NY I will paint and install them..... more to follow
1,For $12.86 you get a .50 sight.,"This is my second sight. I returned the first one because I thought the first one was defective. I now know it was not, it is a poorly designed aiming device that is close to impossible to zero in. I can not describe the words I have call this sight. I have shot close to 200 pellets at a 12 x 12 inch target at 30 feet from a fixed platform making minor adjustments. The results were less than 1% hits in the 2 inch circle. I remove the Red Dot Sight and using the less than stellar sights that came with pistol I was able to place 4 with in the 2 inch circle. Save your money and look elsewhere.I must also state that my comments no way are against Amazon. They are a great company and I will continue to shop with them."
3,easy to mount clear directions,"I put this on a chinese break model pellett gun that I could not sight in. So I saw this and thoughht it would be perfect for my pellett gun. I found the sight adjustment knobs to be loose and difficult to keep in plsce.(I remedied that with a rubberband around the spindle)it seems to hold adjustment ok I had to cut away part of the battery cover to accomadate my rail.So overall for the price not bad. I can shoot 1"" @ 20 yards so not too bad"
2,TRASH !!,"Waste of time and money! You'd think that the company that builds the pistol would sell a red dot the works on the pistol,wrong ! Not enough elevation control to make it work on my 2240 pistol. Shoots 3"" high with it set all the way down. Mucho disappointment.! Too cheap to return but I'll save it anyhow. Crosman is getting a nasty email from me after I finish this."
5,Now I can acquire and actually hit something!,The red dot sight was a great price / value for old eyes that couldn't see that tiny front sight.
2,Poorly constructed,"There were several manufacturing defects that became evident upon delivery: 1) One of the two mounting screws had no threads. 2) Left/right adjustment knob was nonadjustable. It was frozen and would not move. 3) The up/down adjustment was too loose, which caused the sight to lose zero too easily.I ordered another sight for around $50 due to these defects. It is a shame. Without the above mentioned problems, it would be a nice and very cheap sight."
3,crossman red dot,"not bad for the but not a precision sight, Wouldnt buy it again. I bought it to replace scope that came with gun which was not much better."
2,Crosman Redot,"I purchased this about three weeks ago, the only reason was for the free shipping for the price I was not expecting much (Have low expection and you're never disappointed) so I was right product is Cheaply made hard to zero in, Standing less then 10-15 away using a Crosman SSP250 at first I thought it might be me so I removed it.start hitting the bullseye place it back on shooting high only thing I might say is may be I need to move the target back further or try placing it on my .22 cal rifle."
3,Hard to set,The sight is hard to set. It just does not work like I thought it would because I have been unable to get it sighted in.
1,Very disappointed,"I waited about a week for this product. I was happy because I never really bought a red dot sight and I thought that for the price it would be a good beginner product. Well I guess you really do get what you paid for because when I received it and opened the package, the switch to turn it on and off was a little loose and I though here we go, ""it's broken!"" So if you are looking for a beginner red dot sight, sadly to say with Crosman being a well-known brand, this is really not something you want to buy."
2,Defective,"Great concept for aiming, but this item was defective. As I tried to sight this in, I could not do so without maxing the windage all the way to one side. I realized that the screen was not installed correctly. It had a gap on one side between the glass (plastic) and the houseing, so that it was not perpendicular to the laser."
4,Crosman 0290 Red Dot Sight,"I purchased this sight about a week ago. It seems pretty solid in construction, although the power switch mechanism came loose about two days ago. The glass on the front is mirrored and hard to see through but from the end you will look through, it's relatively easy to see through it. The dot is pretty bright. Windage and elevation adjustments work well. Overall, it's not perfect, but it's definitely worth the $16."
4,Use on my M4,"I use this on my airsoft M4 it works good accurate, seems to be sturdy enough and has lasted through many battles."
5,Can't go wrong,"My grandson has a $40 Crosman Airsoft rifle. It's nice, but it's a pump shotgun design and doesn't have a sight. After searching around I bought this one. He's very happy with it.Yes, it's made primarily out of plasic, but come on folks, it's $12 and you're using it on an Airsoft rifle. If you want a metal sight you're simply going to have to pay more (a lot more).The sight comes with removeable brackets so it can be used on a dovetail mount or a Weaver mount. It also comes with a battery and a spare.The sight was very easy to zero in, good adjustments for up/down and right/left.Couldn't be happier."
1,bad,well when i got it i was really excited but as soon as i got it on my pulse r76 it didnt fit so before you buy this make sure you know.
1,Oops!,"I knew I was getting an inexpensive sight for an air gun, but i didn't expect it to break out of the box. It was used so I don't hold the manufacturer responsible. It looks like it has been super glued and the dot wasn't centered, so the dot is always to the right of center. My bad for buying used I guess. It will be fun to fiddle with since it is now worthless."
2,just too cheaply made.,I think if this sight had been made a little better it would work fine. The first one I received had a busted glass in viewfinder. The second one had the + terminal come unglued in battery compartment. I sent it back for a refund. The red dot seemed ok and fairly accurate...but not worth it. It was only $11 so there ya go.
2,Cheap,Cheap product. Don't bother. It is made of cheap plastic and everything on it is flimsy. I would definitely not recommend it to anyone.
1,Don't waste your money. The price says it all.,"I have spent hours trying to make this work for my application. Weak lighting and toy like quality.Yes it's for an air pistol, but you want it to add value. The price was to good to be true. My mistake, I know better. The 1377 pistol is worth the money. I'm investigating a decent laser instead for my 1377."
1,Cheap Junk,Item defective right out of the package.Red dot would not come on.One of the wires going to the cheap on/off switch was broken.I was able to pry off the switch [it was glued on] and fix the problem.This sight is poorly made and I would advise people to get something else.
1,This sight has a birth defect,"Even at point blank range, this sight couldn't do better than 8"" low and left. Defintely a manufacturing defect. It's so cheap (both price and performance) that I just trashed it rather than try to return it.Crossman has been a respected name but I would now hesitate to buy any Crossman product for my grandchildren."
