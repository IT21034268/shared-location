3,Eh...so-so,"I've used Mandrake 8.0, 8.1, and now 8.2. I have also switched to SuSE 8.0. I like Mandrake and I like some things they do. But, the problems are just too numerous to recommend, in my opinion. Mandrake tries to be a little too bleeding edge, and when I was testing 8.2, I had some issues that I could not resolve. On the other hand, SuSE 8.0 ran out of the box for me on both my home-built desktop and my Dell laptop. Absolutely no major issues on either machine.The other thing is that Mandrake is now releasing 9.0 beta to its testers. I don't understand Mandrake's accelerated release schedule. 8.2 just appeared in stores and they're already working on 9.0. Go figure.Anyway, keep an eye on Mandrake, they are a nice company and put out a nice distribution. I would just look elsewhere for now."
1,Impossible to register,"Unless you are courageous enough to venture out on your own without any customer support, this is probably NOT the product to buy. In order to get the 2 months of free customer support the product must be registered using the serial number in the box. However, when I tried to register my purchase, I would get an ""Invalid Number"" error when I tried to enter the serial number. After making many telephone calls (some of which were not toll free), I was told I needed a new registration number. After many more phone calls, I was given a phone number to fax a copy of my invoice and the UPC code on the box. This I did. I have not heard a word since. Meanwhile, the time remaining on my ""Two months"" of free customer support is quickly ebbing away."
1,Not Drifters,I did not enjoy the music - Nothing close to the original drifters - Too much improvising - should have tried to sound like the originals
4,side visibility for bike commuters with down low glow,"I have the single tube green down low glow and I'm pretty pleased with it so far. It was easy to mantle to the bike and a motorist would have to be blind not to see me coming down the street with the DLG turned on. The system is convenient in that it is made to work on a variety of bikes and you can turn it off when it isn't in use. The disadvantage I see is that the battery pack is not waterproof so you have to wrap it up if you are riding on wet days. Overall, I would recommend it to any bike commuter wanting to increase their side visibility for cars."
5,Multi-level Psychic SM Drama,"This is a work that has political, psychological, psychic, physical, sexual overtones. Power, sex and politics are intertwined into a cauldron of pain, passion, desire and submission. For those who seek the depths of the power to transform, subdue and the life force that ultimately triumphs over it all, this is a great book."
2,A disappointment.,This is not a cd I can recommend. The cover I read on the net implied that this was the Clarke Boland Big Band with Jimmy Guiffre. But it is two very different cds. They have absolutely nothing in common whatsoever. What fooled me was that the CBBB had recorded with Stan Getz as the guest sax player and this is what I believed this cd was about. The front face of the CD on the net clearly says Clarke - Boland Big Band Jimmy Guiffre with Bob Brookmeyer & Jim Hall. When I received the CD the cover illustration said something different and made it clear that it was two different cds.No more needs to be said.
3,Jamillennium review,"I went and saw Jamil play in New Orleans and I really enjoyed the music; so I decided to buy the cd. The cd is quite enjoyable, but I would rather have heard more of Jamil's original music. Many of the tracks are covers from other jazz greats, and although I will always enjoy these, I feel Jamil should emphasize his own music more. The originals that were on this cd were very good, though."
4,Quickoffice 6,I travel a lot to meetings and conference and use my Palm to keep organized while I am on the road. My desktop has Microsoft files and with this product I can build and edit files on the road and synchronize my work easily between my PDA and desktop when I get back to my office or at home. Very useful product!
1,Wrong Item Sent,"The seller advertised a motorcycle repair book for the years 1962-1975. The repair book that was delivered was for the years 1963-1974. My motorcycle is a 1975. This book does me no good. The seller failed to respond to this problem and then added information to their advertisement explaining that the book was actually from 1963-1974. AMAZON reimbursed me for the full amount. This was most likely a typo and the seller could have easily responded to the buyer to make the transaction right, but they did not respond at all."
5,"""Testimonies"" is an unforgettable story","I can only describe the book's effect on me. I was unable to put the book down until finished, and then unable to forget the story. Don't expect a happy ending story in the vein of OBrian's Seafaring historical novels. This novel is very different."
5,Ouch.,"This book hit me hard. Both with the sheer power of its carefully choosen words and the awesome might of its collective stories.And there is more than one story here. There is the tale of the rugged, unforgiving land of Wales and the equally hard people it has produced; there is the parable of a tragic entanglement between two people who do everything to avoid it; and there is the epic hint of a final justice for the characters, and a final truth for us all.I read this novel four years ago this summer and I can still vividly recall the ecstasy of emotion that I felt when I finished it."
5,This book really sneaks up on you,"I only bought this book because I'm a big fan of his seafaring series. I really did not like his Rendezvous at all.Normally I would much rather walk over hot coals than read a romance novel. But this book hooks you from the beginning. It starts in a timid way about a timid man and gradually builds toward a real tragedy.Descriptions of Wales and the people are well done. But kind of disheartening to read how unkind people can be towards each other ...for no real reason....just spite and meanness. I guess people are the same everywhere..As the other reviewer mentioned, this book will affect you. It stays with you after you finish it. Not normally something that happens to me."
4,One Roman leaders whose name is in infamy,"Paul L. Maier is obviously a scholar, and his novel about Pontius Pilate is the evidence. Providing endnotes to his facts, Maier paints a picture of a Pilate who is interested in preserving his own neck while making the correct political moves, yet too often the prefect ends up making the wrong alliances as well as the wrong calls. The novel is a little slow in some spots--even getting a little complex as one needs to keep track of the many characters, especially the ""Herods""-- but it's worthwhile sticking with it till the end. I only wonder what Pilate's fate really was, as Maier himself admits that his end is left up to speculation. All in all, Pontius Pilate is good reading, especially around the time of Lent and the days leading up to the Easter story."
4,great book,I have read Paul Maier's other books and he is very detailed on historical accuracy. This book is no different. Lots of facts and a story that will keep you interested and make you think about the man in maybe a different way.
4,Excellent historical page-turner,"Maier calls this book a ""documentary novel,"" meaning that no events contradict history and the events are typical of the time. His work is essentially a character sketch of Pontius Pilate that paints a clear picture of the time of Christ from a Roman point of view. His detailing of the politics of Rome and their relationship to Judea as well as the politics of Judea and their relationship to Rome was outstanding. Maier's writing still sounds a little much like a professor rather than a novelist (hence the 4 stars instead of 5), but for me the engrossing way in which the events unfold more than made up for the lack of powerful writing. Ultimately, this was a book I just couldn't put down--even though I was essentially learning world history from cover to cover."
5,Luciano Rules!,"The Maestro, the best there is and ever will be, at His glorious best! Live in the middle of Central Park - no studio ""fixes"" here. Superb mix of arias and Italian folk songs (as only He can do them). Only thing missing is something from Boheme, but if you love the Pav, you already have Boheme. The song ""Rondine al Nido"" is a heart-wringer. Please find the English translation -- and prepare to weep. In this selection, Himself goes where tenors fear to tread -- He matches flute! You'll see. This is more than a ""Concert in the Park"" -- this is Pavarotti in all his magnificence.Laura in the desert"
4,Enlightening,"""The Cultural Defense"" integrates an abstract theoretical discussion of cultural pluralism with a close and sensitive analysis of a wide range of concrete cases. The result is an illuminating account of the nature, logic, and limits of culture as a legitimate basis of differential treatment."" <BR"
5,CULTURAL DEFENSE,"From the Publisher:""Alison Dundes Renteln's ""The Cultural Defense"" is an extraordinarily effective combination of careful anthropology and incisive legal analysis. I am familiar with no other work that presents such a formidable case for revision of the evasions denying a place to minority culture in our legal universe."" --Judge John T. Noonan, Jr."
4,B HORROR FILM,"ACTUALLY C HORROR FLICKS , JUST FUN AND GROSS. IF YOU LIKE KAYO SYRUP THIS IS FOR YOU. PROBALY A LITTLE HERSHEYS TOO. NOT TO MENTION A PORN STAR, THE LAST ONE YOU THINK WOULD BE."
5,"Pretty, perfect print",I love flower prints. This print fits the bill perfectly for me. I love the design and the colors. The paper quality and price were added bonuses.
4,Plummer is the only Brit I've ever liked,"Just read a wonderful little book that I heartily recommend. It's called TALES OF A RAT-HUNTING MAN. It's the non-fiction memoirs of a British guy who is a rat hunting afficionado. It's all about ferrets and dogs and the killing of brown rats. But there is much more to it than that. It's an extended essay and apology (that is, defense) of a way of life in England that is almost impossible to sustain in that claustophobic culture--but somehow D. Brian Plummer has managed to keep a bit of freedom in the stratified rubble. This is really the only Englishman I think I could ever like. He's got a hell of a narrative voice, and is obviously no eccentric, though he enjoys playing one. Anyway, read this slender volume and you'll have a hard time fighting the urge to go hunt rats with a dog, ferret and stick. Plummer makes it seem so...alluring and cathartic."
1,Not Even Close,My mom bought me this cd and I was so excited until I heard it this is definitely not Bon Jovi and the people that sing on this cd don't come close to sounding like them.
4,"Never Mind The Songs, Gil & Gino Rock","Just one of a series of sports team salute discs, the New England Patriots disc is a must for Pats fans. The songs are the usual arena favs, but that's not why I bought the disc - it is the radio clips of great Pats moments that are the real draw.Gil Santos and Gino Cappeletti are the primary play-by-play callers for Patriots radio, and their calls of great Pats moments are a treat. Nostalgia rules in clips from 1978 and also from the clips of Pete Carroll's defeat of ex-Pats coach Bill Parcells in September 1997, of Drew Bledsoe's bombing runs on Minnesota in 1994, and of the slaughter of the Steelers in the 1996 season playoffs.For a future Pats disc, clips from 1999's Tuna Bowl V, Bledsoe's 21-point-gap erasure against the Colts a week later, and both his November 1998 comeback thrillers with a broken index finger should be included."
3,"Fun for Patriots fans, but could be better","The ""Patriots Greatest Hits"" CD is a treat for Patriots fans, especially those who have been to games at Foxboro Stadium. The collection contains popular songs played during games at Foxboro, as well as actual clips of game action culled from game broadcasts.While this disc is good, I feel it was not done as well as the ""Packers Greatest Hits"" collection CD from the same company. That disc is much more energetic, and even includes the ""Monday Night Football"" theme as well. The game sound bites are often too short, and (while this is not necessarily the fault of the CD company) the older ones can be staticy and hard to understand."
1,You Can't Be Serious!!!???,"Ok, I purchased this book for Kindle because it had very good reviews. Now that I'm about 1/3 of the way through it I'm wondering WTF??!!?? What kind of trickery is this? All you all related to the author? All of these good reviews for a book that I have no desire to even finish. This book is terribly written. The chapter breaks all seem to be in the wrong places. Overall, it's slow, unrealistic, boring and I regret purchasing it."
5,WHO CAN YOU TRUST?????,"This book was that work!!!!! For those that don't know the sequel is called DEAD MAN'S VENGEANCE which can be purchased at 4blunt.com, the book sells for $20 & some change."
4,The Ultimate Betrayal ...,"Chino and Donell were the best of friends; Chino and Shark were like family. Everything seemed to be cool, until Chino goes to the left. Chino betrays Donell and Shark in the worst ways, and wreaks havoc on their entire operation. After he betrays both of his friends, Chino finds himself being hunted down with a bounty on his head.B.L.U.N.T. makes you wonder if friends can really stay friends when power, drugs, money, love and sex are involved."
5,A Masterpiece of Genuine Entertainment,"If you haven't read this book, I strongly advise that you do. This book is the perfect pick-me-up for anyone who is having stressful days in their life. I'm not saying it's a cure for the blues, it's just a great way to end a stressful day without DVDs, video games, and junk food (it's great for parents too). Anyway, Candy Lane Craze is truly amazing. You will absolutely love the charming details about Sweet Little. This town is dreamy, stylish, and fancy. It's a terrific magical get-away for the young travelers in this story. The good news is, despite all the luxurious surroundings and the humorous mishaps, the kids want to come home to their parents (my favorite part). It's a great way to say that the world today is filled with nice places to go and nice things to buy, but the best place to be is at home with your family and friends who love you. Everyone in my family loves this story and I believe you will too."
3,A nice funny and heart-warming kids book,"I read Candy Lane Craze during my last semester in college because my little neices told me about it. They found the book on the Internet and then I borrowed their copy when they bought it. Although the plot is not entirely a winner, it's clearly a book of funny events that make you smile as you read it. I truly fell in love with the main characters Johnny, Sara, and Sabrina. They're so cute together, and I have to admit there were moments where I teared up because of the happy and sad chapters in the book. It's magical, it's fun, it's easy to read. I think I read the entire book in a week or so, it's definitely a page turner for kids that like strange and funny adventure stories."
1,Hate this router,"My old Netgear router was a cinch to set up compared to this. I'm running XP on a 6-month old laptop -- maybe it'll work OK with Vista but I've tried to set it up 3 times this week with no luck. Conflicting instructions on the CD, Manual and web-site (that's 3 sets of instructions) make it worse. After installing, it caused a shut-down error (two times) that required a system restore to fix. The IP address may or may not have to be entered manually at which point it overrides the wired network IP address which then has to be ""repaired"" in order to connect again. The whole thing is a mess. I looked at Flashing the firmware but honestly, it's not quite as easy it the other posts make it sound. Newegg reviews show several people with the same problems and Buffalo offers virtually NO tech support."
2,Overhyped Buffalo Chip,"I've owned and set up many routers and expected this one to good from the hype. Not only was its instruction manual totally useless, but its performance was never as good as even the average router performance I'd experienced previously.It totally died on me after a couple months.Dealing with their Customer Service was a nightmare I'll never again subject myself to. They also double as salesmen, trying to get more money from you. They tried to sell me a more expensive router at an inflated price, and several calls only taught me they are clueless about their own products. On the other hand, they must be trained well in trying to avoid RMA's.I took with a grain of salt the claims that Buffalo employees artificially pumped up their online ratings, until this experiencing their products/CS firsthand."
1,Requires constant power cycling to keep it up,"This router has been in operation for about 3 weeks. When it is functioning correctly, it is a pleasure to use. Unfortunately, it requires almost daily power cycling to keep it running - all the idiot lights show normal operation, but there's no wired or wireless connectivity until it's power cycled."
3,not as good as...,"I bought this router a month ago and I think it not as good as people says because I lose connection several times, I have to turn it off and on again to get the connection working properly."
2,Phone-it-in hack job,"As the author acknowledges in the foreword, any 'top 100' list is bound to be highly subjective. Unfortunately, the foreword is about the only place where an explanation/defense of the rankings can be found.The remainder of the book is a paint-by-numbers, term-paper rehash of each golfer's bio and records - information readily available elsewhere (and obviously the basis for this cut-and-paste edition).Spelling errors (""symbollic"", ""Colin Montgomery"") confirm the complete lack of effort.To use everybody's favorite Amazon cliche, don't waste your time or money."
5,Monteith's Mountains,I enjoyed reading Monteith's Mountains very much.At first was afraid it was going to be too sexual and gory but found out soon that it was neither. Kept me wanting to pick it up again and again. The descriptions of the places and beauty of the mountains also drew me into this book. I really think Skip Brooks needs to write us another one in this beautiful setting!
2,Intermittent reception,"I have not been impressed with the reception of this radio. As another reviewer stated, the antenna seems to be the wire of the earbuds. For me, this causes radio stations to have a rythmic swish of loud static as the cord swings while I run. I've tried putting the cord under my shirt, which stops the rhythm of the static, however, there is still a lot of static at times. It seems to be related to which cardinal direction I am facing and how the radio is oriented on my shorts. Last, the radio will sometimes just seem to lose a station... not matter how finely I turn the little dial, I simply can't get it to come in clearly. And for me, reception indoors is simply awful. All in all, it's highly annoying and I would gladly pay triple what this radio costs for one that could lock onto a station clearly."
3,Buyer Beware,"An excellent outline for the ACI 89/92 Code. However, it is NOT for the current ACI code! If you are designing with the older version of the Code, this book is great. If you are using the 2002 or 2005 Code, this book is essentially obsolete.I somehow missed that when I ordered the book.GH - PE"
5,Excellent Maine Humor,"As with all of John Gould's work, this collection of stories from Maine will keep you in varying stages of mirth, from smiles, through chuckles, to outright laughs and stomach hurting guffaws. If you have lived in Maine, or only visited, this will take you back, with pleasure."
1,dont buy it,THIS DVD WAS SHOT AT THE AVN OR PORN SHOW. IT COULD HAVE BEEN DONE ANYWHERE WITH OLD PORN STARS. IT IS NOT DONE ON THE STREETS OF LAS VEGAS. DONT WAST YOUR MONEY!
3,Disappointed with the type quality,"I looked forward to owning a Thompson Chain-Reference Bible, but had to return it. The copy I purchased was printed in Korea, and the type quality was uneven and not up to my expectations. Particularly in the New Testament red letter sections, some of the pages were pale pink and at least two pages were hard to read because the print was so faint. Sorry to not give a great review, but the quality doesn't match the reputation. Maybe they should reconsider the practice of printing it in Korea . . ."
3,For those complaining of the quality.,"I own thisThompson Chain Reference Bible (Style 539burgundy) - Handy Size KJV - Bonded Leatheredition of the Thompson Chain, I am a bit disappointed at the quality (I can't complain --- It's a gift), but for those that do not want a new Thompson because of quality issues, You may want to consider the Westminster Reference Bible from the Trinitarian Bible Society. The Trinitarian Bible Society outsources printing to the Cambridge University Press --- You know they make good stuff."
2,Letters are not large enough,"Although the Bible is called a a large print bible, in fact the words are too small to read if your sight is less than perfect"
4,Kept me guessing to the end,"What a great read. 450 pages is rather formidable for a mystery, and I was beginning to wonder if I would get ""hooked"" as I approached page 200 but, for me, the book took off lickety-split and raced to the end from there. I really enjoyed the entirely plausible ""red herrings"" the author tossed in and the way he anticipated the reader's (my) confusion in the persons of his inspectors. And he kept my in suspense about the identity of the murderer to the end. What piqued my interested initially and what kept me going was my passion for the music of Sibelius. The many references to the composer and his life, as well as the series of lectures being given throughout the mystery by the inspector's father, is a brilliant plot device. And, may I say, not too much for the casual reader or too little for the music lover. Altogether, a great read--and I learned some new things about the composer as well."
4,An Intellectual Murder Mystery,"This book is unique. It is an intellectual murder mystery. That sounds like an oxymoron, but Boswell manages to pull it off. I couldn't put the book down. My only criticism is that I wanted our heroine Miranda to achieve as much success and satisfaction in her personal (love) life as in her professional life."
3,I wish I could share the enthusiasm ...,"... of the other reviewers here. I don't often read mysteries, but shortly before taking in this one, I'd read another, the beautiful Bury Your Dead by Louise Penny. By comparison I found Symphonies clunky in style and over-plotted. And then I was fairly sure who did it by page 100 or so, and quite certain shortly after 300. I did enjoy the musicological lectures. The author clearly loves and understands Sibelius."
1,Musically Uninspiring,"I'm sorry to report that this musical performance is among the most flaccid I have seen. It completely lacks spontaneity and passion, and appears staged, contrived, and scripted, like something you'd see in a made-for-TV movie on cable. The audience looks like a rent-an-audience from some nearby info-mercial. Robby Kreiger appears dressed in a camo outfit that is inexplicably perfectly pressed. Not even his collar is wrinkled. Manzarek's organ doesn't sound like the original, and although his playing is technically proficient, it lacks power and passion, as do Astbury's vocals. It seems like each performer is simply going through the motions, even on such kick-butt pieces as L.A. Woman. It has all the fervor of a clinical medical exam."
2,JIM I HOPE YOU FORGIVE WHAT THEY DONE TO YOUR MUSIC,"THE MUSIC REAL GOOD, THE SINGER THE BAND USE FOR THIS CONCERT (IAN ASTBURY) IS NOT THE RIGHT GUY FOR SING IN THIS CONCERT HE SOUND SO STUPID IS LIKE PUT ALICE COOPER TO SING LIKE JIM MORRISON IS NO WAY, NICE TRY DOORS BUT GET THE PEYOTE OUT OF YOU EARS AND NEXT TIME LOOK FOR A BETTER SINGER SORRY I AM DISSAPOINTED WITH THIS CONCERT"
4,"Well worthwhile , they're not just in it for the money","Whether one is a fan of the Doors or not, what I liked about them was the style of the keyboard and guitar playing - both quite distinctive . I also loved the drumming .Though the singer died , they have found another singer who loves the music and takes the opportunity to sing for all the fans who deserve to hear the music performed again - as long as it's done well .This DVD shows all this was done with the best intentions and there is nothing worse than a musician who can still play and is not playing - it is a kind of living death .A lot of bands have gotten rich imitating the Doors .This is as close as we can get to the original sound , forgetting about the original drummer's lawsuit .Well done guys - I wish you more success ."
5,F*#%^&ing GREAT!,"Sure Morrison is gone, but this dude is prob the bets they couda got, fantastic job filling in. The Band is tight, great set list, great 5.1 sound....this DVD ROCKS!The only member missing (besides Jim) is drummer John Densmore, but who cares, hes just the drummer, you cannot replace Robby's guitar work and certainly not Ray's keyboard style. The Band does what wouda been the LA Woman tour....you must get this!"
3,FUN Nancy Allen film,Low budget cheapie starring Nancy Allen.At 46 Allen still looks good but there's a bit too much collagen in those lips - check it out! PS - forget that ugly DVD cover. Allen gives an OK performance. Best line Indian to Allen:This land filled with evil spirit. Allen to indian:No argument there! Good DVD print and GREAT sound.Opening scene with Allen on the run is the best. A must for all Allen fans
2,mediations in music,"It is really not a meditation music, so if you purchase it with this in mind, pass on..."
1,I feel violated.,"I was a huge fan of Mitchard's other books, but this one was just awful. Like other reviewers, I kept reading thinking that it would get better. IT DOESN'T! I don't understand how this book got published. The damage to Mitchard's standing will be long-lasting. (...) It was just awful!"
1,Twelve Times Bored,"I really have to wonder whether Mitchard had an editor on this one. Almost every line of French has a mistake in it (She can't even spell simple phrases like ""Comment vas-tu?"" correctly), almost every ballet step is misspelled (""chine"" turns for ""chaine"" turns), and, perhaps worst of all for a novel supposedly set in Massachusetts, she uses the phrase ""in Cape Cod,"" which a Cape Codder would never use; it's ""on Cape Cod""!Aside from the mistakes, the book is slow going and descends midway to the level of soap opera. Don't waste your time on this book."
1,Poorly Written Tripe!,"I am so glad I am not the only one that wanted to call Child Protective Services on True! I really tried to read this book but found it more and more difficult as Trues' character is revealed! She is so uncaring about her sons' safety and easily lets others make decisions for her. Hank is so vapid, I wonder what she ever saw in him. Of course, he is good-looking but come on, you must get out of bed sometime! I wonder what turmoil Mitchard was enduring when she wrote this book. IT is just terrible!! My advice is don't bother."
2,"A whole bunch of self-absorbed, exhausting characters",I plowed through this book. Several times I wondered if these characters EVER just stopped talking-mostly the women. The self-absorption and over-analysis of everything was exhausting. Was there even one likeable or believable woman in this story? I wanted to tell Hank to run!
2,2.5 stars,"really wanted to like this book: on her 43rd birthday, True is out celebrating with friends when she meets a younger man and falls in love.It was a good idea, but it failed for several reasons: these two (True & Hank) don't say what they mean and don't mean what they say. Most of the book was them fighting and not getting along because of their darn pride! Frustrating.The other big issue I had with this book is the overly long chapters and overall length of the book, 500 pages, about 200 pages too long. There are a lot of little side stories that are unimportant and serve no purpose, just wasting the reader's time.So between the wordiness and overall negative tone of the book, I can't recommend it."
2,Not Quite Blessed,"Better than The Most Wanted, not as good as Deep End or A Theory of Relativity. I so want her books to be good, but am again disappointed. Way too many characters (reflective of the author's personal life, I presume) and way too many swear words.I'm not a prude, but I can't share this book with my mother!"
1,I'm glad its not just me,"This had the potential to be a good book, but it took me forever to finish it; I had to actually force myself! It just seemed to go on and on...and on. So much of the manuscript could have been taken out..probably 200 pages. I'm glad it wasn't just me who thoguht this."
2,"Some parts are quite clever, but it gets old quickly","I bought this book on a whim, having seen an interview with the author on the Today Show when I was on vacation and on the lookout for a light read. There were some nice segments, but on the whole, it seemed somewhat self-indulgent on the author's part. My favorite part was the feeling in the beginning of the book that you were ""inside their heads"", but these explanations appeared to grow longer as we became more familiar with the characters rather than the reverse. It was like being with someone who loves the sound of their own voice--you may keep listening, but part of you tunes out.Having labored through the second half, with little additional (or unexpected) development, I wish I had skipped the last 200 pages and just read the last chapter. I didn't even give this one to the resale shop."
1,Horrible Book!,"My title says it all. This book is awful. The writing is sloppy and too wordy, the characters go from one strange quirk to the next, and the story isn't consistent at all. The minor characters are just that, when they could really add to the story in a meaningful way. I'm nearly finished with the book, I don't care how it ends, and I've quit reading it."
2,Still waiting for the story....,"About 170 pages into this book, I still had no idea where the author was attempting to go with the story as she was jumping all over the place and never really laid down a set story line to keep the reader glued. I figured out pretty quickly that is was a story of love, or whatever, between a younger guy/older woman but other then that, I'm not quite sure what to think. Luckily for me, my job allows for passing the time away, and that's really what this book did....so save it for a desperate, rainy day when you really have nothing else you could be doing!"
1,Mitchard is off-track,"The Deep End of the Ocean and The Most Wanted were two of the most creative, and well-written ""popular"" books, I have read. The creative process was flowing, and I had the feeling that these characters were so real, that Mitchard, herself, didn't know how the book would end until it was done. I think she was a pioneer in (once more, I'm using quotaion marks) ""popular"" literary fiction. A Theory of Relativity was disappointing. All writers, I suspect, have a book that is out-of-sync. However, with Twelve Times Blessed, this indicates a pattern. The characters were uninteresting; the plot pedestrian. Mitchard's narrative is excellent, and she can do this for $$$... All I can add, is I hope Mitchard regains her voice, and does not serve us any more pap."
1,Twelve Times Cursed,"This book is what you'd get if you inserted a thesaurus into a Mills & Boon novel - an overly long, excessively wordy, sappy romance.The characters are horribly underdeveloped; we know very little about them aside from their romantic foibles and sexual adventures. (And then there were several cases of Too Much Information.)A more positive review quotes ""'Once again, we readers are blessed with J.M.'s sensuous eye for detail"". Cursed, would seem more apt.Descriptions of young boys genitalia, the burgeoning of an erection, and several other unnecessary observations mentioned throughout this self-indulgent saga were disappointing.This is not Mitchard's best piece of work. The Deep End of The Ocean and The Most Wanted are exceptional novels; Twelve Times Blessed does not come close."
2,good idea that went awry,"Nobody -- or no editor -- put the brakes on this thing. Basically, there's too much of everything. Too much repetitive dialogue, too many pages, too much domestic life under a microscope and not enough plot, not enough motivation for characters, and while we're at it, a bit too much cutesy. Mitchard has personally been there done that (marrying a younger man), and it seems the reader is mostly just privvy to 500-plus pages of what that experience is like."
1,Snore,This book was a complete & total waste of my time. I kept reading it hoping that something would happen. It was too long and drawn out and had no action or movement of story whatsoever.I am very disappointed.
1,Very poorly written,"The plot isn't worth going into and the writing is poor--clearly no editor took much of a look at it. Some sentences simply don't make sense or adjectives are used to describe something in ways that don't seem to fit. Other times, the storyline isn't coherent--details suddenly change, almost like describing a character wearing a red coat and then two paragraphs later saying the person took off their blue coat. It reads like a book very hastily put together. Glad I got it out of the library-had I paid for it, I would want my money back."
1,Terrible,"Jacquelyn Mitchard's books are usually excellent. This one is terrible. I agree with most of what the other reviewers who panned this book wrote and will not bother to repeat their on-the-mark comments. One thing that has not been mentioned about this book, however, is Mitchard's incredible hostility toward Christians. Her Christian, homeschooling mother character, Genevra, is truly appalling, telling small children that they are headed to hell, something no Christian I know would dream of doing. She makes other anti-Christian statements in the book, including a paragraph where she accuses God of mistreating Jesus. Has it not occured to Ms. Mitchard that people of many faiths read her books and that quite a few of them would be offended by comments like these? I don't know if I will ever read another of her books."
3,"Not as good as earlier works, but still good...","I'm not surprised that this book is getting somewhat panned by other readers; it doesn't live up to Mitchard's other work. But if I didn't know it was written by her, and hadn't had the expectations that come with it, I would have considered it a good book. Actually, I put off reading it for awhile, because of the other reviews I'd read; once I picked it up yesterday I read the whole thing in about two days. I couldn't put it down! It is beautifully written, as Mitchard's earlier works. The characters are actually very realistic, as they are neither ""good"" nor ""bad"", but written like real people, stubborn, flawed, and difficult to communicate with. The book is messy and emotional, like life tends to be. So I recommend you give it a chance; just don't expect it to be a life-changing experience."
1,A very Disappointing Book,"I found this book to be very disappointing. The main characters are too much. Too effortlessly beautiful, rich, sexy, blah, blah, blah. As a reader, I didn't even care for them, much less what happened to them.I am an avid fan of Ms. Mitchard's past work and the weekly newspaper column she writes. She could do much better.I would not recommend this book."
1,Twelve Times Blessed,BORING!!! Its hard to believe that this book made the NY Times bestseller list! I kept reading hoping it would get more interesting and it just got worse! Don't waste your money on this one!
4,Deserves a better rap than it gets,"I just read this book after picking it up for a beach read. I also noticed some typos and places where editing was overlooked, but the story itself kept me highly interested while wondering what the fate of True and Hank would be in the end. I did not think any of it far-fetched---who wouldn't be flattered and enticed by the attentions of a younger man, especially after eight years of widowhood and raising a child on your own? While this book may not be one of Ms. Mitchard's best works, it does not deserve the bad rap it gets on this site!"
2,Twelve Times Blessed,"This novel by Jacquelyn Mitchard is very drawn out, boring and has way too many useless details. In ""Twelve Times Blessed"" True Dickenson (the main character) is a very succesful business woman,who marries a younger resturant owner. The story is about their lives as they learn to live with each others faults. Theybecome aware of many things they do not know about each otheras they became involved before they knew anything about theirprior lives or families. This book sometimes loses your interestby involving you in the details of people that are not the maininterest of the story. The story needed more detail on True andHank,less on small trivial details of other peoples lives."
3,A disappointing book,"I thought this book had such promise and I kept reading, but it was just mediocre. Mitchard tried too hard to develop a conflict that just didn't make sense. How absurd that two grown people would keep misunderstanding each other. But I did think her sex scenes were pretty good or did she use the word ""shaft"" - I think so and I hate that. If she's going to write graphically about sex, then call it what it is."
1,terribly written -- not to mention hate-filled,"A great deal of this book is devoted to Christian-bashing. The sole purpose of one of the characters is to serve as a vessel for the author's hatred of evangelical Christians. The character is introduced as a ""super-Christian"" who homeschools her children and is revealed to be a malicious, lying, violent, child-hating gossip.At another point, the main character and her best friend find themselves in a bed-and-breakfast with needlepoint Scripture verses on the walls, which they find frightening and disturbing.These are only two examples.Odd from an author who preaches ""tolerance"" in her newspaper column ..."
3,Blessed or Cursed?,"I've read most of these reviews so thought I would chip in my two cents worth. I think the main thing that bothered me was that Hank couldn't understand why his wife was upset, while he married to her with a baby to a late in life mother was on the way, rushes to the comfort of an old friend, one that he had been most in love with for 6 years. Also I couldn't understand why it took True so long to wonder about 3 people's references to all the letters he wrote to her that she hadn't received. Where was her head. And didn't her doctor tell her it was bed or hospital, which she conveniently ignored and then suffered for it. I don't hold out much hope for the future of that marriage, she is too jealous and concerned with her terrible weight(I should weigh that little) and her age. He is too wrapped up in himself and what he feels like doing at that very moment."
2,Disappointed,"I have enjoyed Mitchard's previous books, and was surprised to find this book did not continue with her earlier promise as an author. I thought the characters were not believable, which makes it difficult to care what happens to them. There simply is no depth to this book. I never quite understood the reasons why True and Hank separated. Their self absorption was wearying at best and the plot was too thin to hold a reader's interest. It was an effort to keep reading it. I do not recommend this book and hope that Ms. Mitchard gets back on track."
4,Historic,"An artifact of the exact moment when Maggie Smith grafted her comic personality off of Kenneth Williams' bush, tree - whatever it is. Dated, but witty and enjoyable, particularly for Anglophiles."
2,Plastic Arm Rests Break,"Agree 100% with CitizenOne. Everything about this chair is wonderful except for the arm rests. First the right broke about a year ago. HumanScale customer service was excellent and sent out a pair of arm rests (not just the right). I guess they knew that the left one would break, too. It did tonight. Fortunately I kept the left arm rest of the pair that HumanScale sent me originally, so I replaced it. At least I was not banging my arm against a sharp object."
3,Darn Arm Rests!,"I agree with the other reviews. I have had this chair for quite some time now and LOVE it, except the arm rests breaking. This would be a pretty easy design fix. (I am an engineer, Humanscale could hire me as a consultant to redesign this thing!) If that were fixed, it would result in the best desk chair I have ever used and a 5 star rating."
3,Too generic,"If you are totally new to sales and have absolutely no background at all, then perhaps this book is one that would be helpful to you. It is mostly common sense.There are simply too many good books out there, hundreds of them, to spend time on this much of a condensed and simple level. Perhaps for a young adult, high school age, this would be a good book to read as a primer for sales or maybe just to see if a career in sales might be something worth considering.As for myself, I skimmed through it and found nothing worth dwelling on as there was nothing here I hadn't already read else where."
3,Cute but Runs Small,"My title explains it all. Normally, I like my clothes at least a little loose fitting. I usually just buy Large in anything other than t-shirts. Well, every other time it's worked. But this tank runs small I guess because it's a large and it feels like it's made for a little girl. I'm not a fat girl or anything so it's not that. I wear size 9 jeans, which is average but not fat, if that gives you any idea. It just doesn't fit. It's so cute though! I wish I had gotten a little bigger size! Oh well. But jeez, I don't want you to buy it bigger and be like ""OMG! It's too big! That girls a liar!"" Maybe it was just mine? I doubt it though. I would say TRY IT ON FIRST!P.s. I bought the matching pants in a large too and they're slightly smaller as well."
5,You want [money] for what?!,"Just about the most fragrant set of lyrics you can't find in mainstream radio today. Melodic in nature, this album aims for spontaneous pleasure with thoughtful moods. I like that can listen to it both in H-1 traffic or candle-lit bath drawn with lavender salts. I pray for more from the Adult Film Stars in the very near future."
2,cheesy euro-pop,"This cd was released in 1999? It sounds like it came out about four or five years ago! Rockell's vocals are fine, and the beats are ok, but I cannot look at this song any differently than a track by La Bouche or Haddaway from 1995. The cd single's choices for remixes are pretty bad as well. The Radio Version, two remixes and their radio edits? Spend your money on something more substantial, that doesn't ALREADY sound dated."
1,Poor,"The seller was nasty and non professional replaying to an e-mail. He blamed defects on book on post office and his customer,he refused to assume responsability."
4,great sh#T,"yo, da ousidaz r da sh#t, cuz they got a unique rhyme style that not a whole buncha otherz got. they can rhyme stuff other rappers wouldnt dream of spittin. but anyway, this is da outz first mainstream lp and its pretty good, u shuld peep da trax. production is mostly good (handled by rocwilder, hotrunner, denaun porter, self-service, and dj twins.) and evry member goes pretty hard wit da rhymin' jo.best trax r: 2, 3 (featrin red n meth.), 6, 7 (funny skit), 8, 9, 11, 14,"
3,Just Ok,"Too much speculation / opinion vs solid facts. Too much back and forth, at one point the authors say you need a scorecard too keep up, and the are not kidding."
4,another view ?,"I liked the format of this book, researcher sharing comments and formulating their opinions. Perhaps a better way of looking at what happened than individual writers have done. Worth a look see."
1,Easy to Use But Unreliable,"We bought this phone two years ago. While the phone is pretty easy to use and has nice features (I've especially enjoyed the handsfree function on the handsets), we've found it to be extremely unreliable. The problems we've had are listed below:*very short battery life for the handsets*the screen on one of our handsets blanked out after only several months of use*the handsets go ""out of range"" when one takes them only a modest distance from the base (even though we have the base in the middle of our house, the handsets don't work at the ends-- and our house is not that big)*the handsets randomly become ""unregistered"" from the base and have to be reset (this has only become a problem in the past month)The issues we've had with this phone have frustrated us so much that we are now shopping for a new phone-- usually we'd expect such a purchase to last longer than two years."
2,Nice features but very unreliable,"I bought this phone for the great features and because I've had good luck with other Motorola products. The phones and answering machine are easy to set up but that is about the only redeeming quality that they have. The handsets frequently lose connection with the base unit. The only way to get them working again is to unplug and then replug the power to the base unit which loses the answering machine settings. Range on the handsets is only mediocre, I can't talk in the far corners of the house even with the base centrally located. Also, battery life is very limited. Overall the phones are very disappointing and I would definitely recommend not buying them."
4,MOTOROLA MD761 ANSWERING MACHINE REVIEW,THE MOTOROLA MD761 ANSWERING MACHINE IS A QIUCK AN EASY initial setup with custom settings such as ringertype and caller id. I was told that the system eats through batteries on the handset but i haven't owned it long enough to review this critique for my own. i like the system so far and reccomend both by seller and her product that she sold!
1,Avoid this phone!,"I bought this base unit and three of the individual phones for use in my home. They just don't hold a charge. I can't tell you the frustration you'll feel when the phone rings, and you pick it up directly from the charging base, only to have the call disconnect due to lack of power. It doesn't matter how long its in the charger. Although it's nice to look at, unless the fix the battery, avoid this one."
4,good phone,It's okay. The phone works well and is rugged. I think it's a good purchase. I highly recommend this phone.
1,A Bad Experience,"I bought this from Amazon along with an extra handset. My kids loved the features and the retro look. But the sound was awful, dropping syllables, and sometimes whole words, of the person on the line so you had to guess what they were saying. Motorola tech support told me to move the phone away from all interference: refridgerators, stereos, lamps. Lamps? ""I thought the 5.8 GHz was meant to resist interference."" ""No sir, these phones are very sensitive."" So I found a corner of my house away from everything, even lamps. Same problem. I returned it to Amazon, losing $40 in fees and postage. Bought a Uniden 5.8 GHz at Sears that turned out to have all the features plus crystal clear sound. Even right next to the lamp!"
5,Great Phone,"Finally, a cordless phone that sounds like a ""good old"" phone. ... meaning the calls sound better than any I've heard from a cordless. We like the handset grip and find it appealing."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS PHONE,Phones won't stay connected to Base Station. Read the review from the guy who's wife died while he could not dial 911. My wife has been yelling at me to get this two handsets fixed for 3 months. Don't BUY IT!!
2,Disappointing and Over-Priced!,"I did quite a bit of research before purchasing this phone - my first cordless - and I have been very disappointed with it. The problems:1. The sounds quality stinks. This could be a function of my apartment building or something in the environment, but I tend to think it's probably the phone.2. The set-up is inordinantly complicated, and needs to be repeated whenever the base gets unplugged.3. The battery life stinks. I've only had the phone for six months, and I can't even get 30 minutes out of the handset before it needs to be recharged.4. The casing around the battery is poorly made, and keeps falling out.5. The 'hand feel' of the handset is weird, and doesn't comform well to the head and hand.The only real 'pro' to this phone is that it looks really cool. Otherwise, it's not worth the money!"
3,its okay,The phone is okay. When i got it there were already missing pixils in the screen (bought it brand new) The battery life is very very small. It does have several ringtones which is nice. But is not very loud in my opinion. When the battery is low it begins to malfunction. I dont reconmend it to someone who needs the battery to last.
5,Wonderful book,"If you are interested in any one of the four authors represented here (Day, Merton, O'Connor, Percy) you will find the context and comparisons that Elie makes extremely illuminating. It is a challenging task to interweave four biographies in a way that is interesting and mutually enriching. Elie does it. He writes well and his comparisons of these four along with other important influences are always clear and helpful. Very well done piece of work."
5,Over the years we have come to expect a lot from Dave,"I have been a Dave McKenna fan for several years. During this time, Dave has spoiled me with his work. I have come to expect a lot from Dave and he always delivers. On this particular cd, Dave has overwhelmed me with exellence. I find that his unique arrangements are mindbogglingly good. I wonder what happened? He must be getting better with every year. Maybe this is his best cd of all time, I listen to this year round!For this cd, Dave used a good repertoire. I know he picked tunes that everyone who has class will enjoy. Like I said this is the best cd of his career, and is a highlight of his long lustrous career. Surely Dave, you've really outdone yourself with these timeless jazz and swing arrangements.Recommednation: If you are looking for beautiful swinging, jazzy, arrangemtns for christmas time or anytime this cd is for you, if you have any class at all you'll buy this, just listen to the samples and you'll hear why. [...]"
1,Over the years we have come to expect a lot from Dave,"I have been a D.M. fan for several years. During this time, Dave has spoiled me with his work. I have come to expect a lot from Dave and he usually delivers. On this particular cd, Dave has not delivered. I find that his unique arrangements are not there. I wonder what happened? Maybe he lost his rabbits foot!For this cd, Dave used a good repertoire. I thinked he picked tunes that most will enjoy. Like I said the only stumbling block for this cd was the ""A"" word. Surely Dave, you could have come up with some better arrangements.Recommednation: If you are looking for beautiful jazz arrangemtns for Chritmas carols, then you need to look somewhere else."
5,Geniuses NEVER fail...ever,"Great musicians, singers and performers the world over have trusted the musical genius of Dave for the better part of the last fifty years. No small wonder he's just that dependable.That said, I'm here to give my highest recommendation to his Concord CD Christmas Party: Holiday Piano. As with all of Dave's performances repeated listenings will reward the listener with deeper and deeper layers of the subtle sophistication Dave has made his hallmark all these many years. Like all great things of quality McKenna's Christmas CD combines a panorama of all the things that make a great solo piano recording; a warm personal sound, marvelously executed bass lines, layers upon layers of harmonic invention and above all melodies played in an engaging and familiar style but with Dave McKenna's personal stamp. My favorite (if it's possible to have just one favorite on this record) is Dave's blues composition ""Don't Want No Blues This Christmas"". Marshall Wood"
5,The Master plays Christmas songs,"Dave McKenna is unquestionably a master of jazz piano. This CD is one of his best efforts - combining his ability to swing hard on some Christmas songs and swing gently on others.It's hard to imagine Christmas tunes being played any better by a jazz pianist-your foot nevers stops tapping. Add to this, three originals that McKenna himself wrote - this is one of the greatest jazz Christmas CDs ever produced."

4,Old recipes play dress up!!,"I don't know about most people, but when I bought my crock pot I fell in love....at first. But after I made the more common crock pot recipes the love died. I found that the food I made was all pretty bland and all had a bit of the same crock pot flavor. My soups and stews all tasted alike. But that is mostly because a lot of the crock pot recipes all utilize similar spices.Well, when I bought New Flavors from your Crockery Cooker I got down my dusty crock pot and gave the new recipes a shot. I was pleased with most of the results. Mind you I have not tried every dish in this book. But I have realized that some of the dishes are pretty much the same as the every day beef stew everyone makes, but with a few little extra's like apple cider mixed in.All in all I think New Flavors from your Crockery Cooker is worth the addition to any culinary library. I mean who doesn't want to try chicken merlot with mushrooms, I did and it was great!!"
2,Never used it,"I bought this on a whim because I was making the same-old same-old when I used the crockpot. However, I never made a single recipe. There was either an ingredient that someone in the family didn't like, or an ingredient that would require a special trip to the store. Let's say we just never clicked. I jettisoned this one when a new cookbook was introduced into the kitchen bookshelf."
1,Dr. Stephen Rosen is Holding on to my Retainer,"I am an attorney in Southern California and retained Dr. Rosen for a case. I sent him a $3000 check for a retainer. After doing nothing and not responding to my calls/e-mails, he informed me that he is too busy for my case and would return my retainer check. That was last May and still no funds have been returned and no response to my calls or e-mails."
5,Extra Security,"I just purchased a used 2003 4RUNNER and the truck club fits perfectly. If you're paranoid like me, the truck club gives you that extra sense of security that your truck wont be stolen (unless someone really really wants your car)."
5,good purchase,"I bought this for my boyfriend for his birthday. He has an older Toyota 4runner, and travels frequently into the city. We had some concerns about the safety of the car, so this seemed like a good idea. So far, so good! I had thought to just purchase the regular size, but decided instead to purchase the SUV/truck size. I am glad I did. Even if someone gets into the car, there is no way they could steer it because this club is quite long. I recommend the product to anyone with concerns about their vehicles safety, especially older cars (which seem to be easier to break into)."
2,truck club,"i thought i would not have any problems with this product! but after installing it about 5 days in a row, the painted chrome is starting to flake off , and fall all over my black interior. but the locking mechanism works ok. thanks"
3,Tribulation Force,"Although I agree with the message of this movie and the purpose for making it, I am undecided about the actual quality of the film. It has its moments and certainly presents the gospel message more strongly than the first installment of the series, but there is something somehow unsatisfying about the final product. It's so difficult to portray God's message in a movie and therin may be the problem. However, I am glad that Christian movies are being made which will hopefully reach the hearts of seekers in an untraditional setting."
5,Best Fiction Movie of the Year,"If you followed the popular book series or not, you will glued to the screen watching this movie. I got it earlier (and cheaper) than most people because the store placed it out before the deadline, tomorrow. You must watch it and then compare the quality of special effect, amazing plot, and superb cast to say the least. Buy this one, it's worth every penny and more!..."
4,Left Behind II - Tribulation Force Review,It is entertaining fiction based on biblical prophesy. This takes prophesy primarily from Revelations and Daniel. In a subtle way it adds some of today's culture and political attitudes to create a story. It may not be an attempt to guess how all the events will unfold but rather to remind us they will come to pass in some fashion at some point in time.
3,"Good movie, but doesn't follow book.","Ive read Tribulation Force, and have seen the first movie,and have recently seen this one. Doesn't meet the same quality of the first movie, which closely followed the book. This movie cuts out almost half the book. I mean, it stopped after just showing the two witnesses. It cuts out the signing of the treaty, and Buck and Chloe's relationship, and wedding, along with Rayford new relationship with Amanda White. It just doesn't meet the same standard as the first Left Behind movie."
2,SOOOO much is left out,"Not being a big reader I chose to watch the movies first...Big Mistake, because I was left wanting to more story so I picked up boook 3 assumeing that is where movie 1 and 2 stopped....I was so lost becuase entire crucial characters were left out. Events like marriages were left out...the movies just do not follow the books. I had hoped they would have follwed the novels as closely as the harry potter movies followed the books but i was disappointed. Although the movie are still good to see but don't expect a pictorial depiction of the books."
4,Left Behind - It gets better!,"Left Behind II picks up where Left Behind closed. The plot has been well thought out but it was a surprise to realize that only half of book 2 was covered by the movie. The acting is as good as any I have seen in ""Hollywood"" movies, Kirk Cameron & Brad Johnson are particularly good in their roles as Buck & Rayford.A puzzling thing was the absence of Chaim.Overall, very good dramatic effect. It will be interesting to see how many movies will be done to cover the whole 12 books.Keep up the good work guys."
5,Awesome Movie,I have to tell you I was thrilled when I saw this movie. It has by far the clearest message ever in a movie. The story was compelling and the acting was supurb. I found it to be so much more interesting then the book was. And the best part is the book was split in two allowing for a second movie to take place. It left me wanting more and more.Gordon Currie rocked as the antichrist bringing his character to a new level. Clarence Gilyard stepped it up to probably his best performance in any movie. Way to go to the makers of this film it was such a huge improvment over the original movie in the series.
2,A wonderful film. A very great sequel,I thourghly enjoyed this film. The story line starts picking up pace as do the events. The message of salvation is constant but not preachy. Rayfords character is stronger and not so meekish as in the first movie. You really start to see Carpithia work his way through the ranks and take tighter control and see his hatred come out towards those who oppose him. The finale where Ben Judah meets the two witnesses (with the events around it) and later makes his annoucement to the world is quite emotional. No one should be disappointed.
4,"Great, but missing things.","I thought this movie was wonderful. It was suspenseful and kept you in your seat. The acting was better than the last movie, as some of the lines were kind of cheesy. The only thing is, they left out 3 major events! Chloe and Buck's wedding, Amanda and Rayford's wedding, (actually, they never even introduced her!), and most importantly, someones death. But I won't mention whose, for the sake of those who haven't seen the movie, or read the book. I did like this movie. I really did. I just have to wonder why they left these parts out."
1,What a boring film,"i think that the greatest problem for Evangelical filmmakers is that they don't understand moral conflict - you're either saved or not. There's no in between, hence they see nothing exciting or don't know how, I'm not sure, to write morally conflictive scenes, where there's a spiritual and temporal threat to the characters. Hence, they write dialogue-heavy, overbearing and certainly unrealistic ""religiousy"" dialogue, as though that were all that's needed to resolve every crisis, however dramatically interesting. Get a real writer for the next film, please. And don't be so darn cheap with the budget - you made lots on the 1st film."
2,If it's anything like the first one....,"My advice is that you save your money. Given the popularity of the book series, they could have put more time, effort, and perhaps money into the movie. The first movie was just lame. Don't expect much from this one either."
2,Not a very good movie at all,"I absolutely love the left behind books, but this movie did them no justice. It was creepy and very weird. I don't know what else to expect from the company that made it, however. It is a very weird company."
2,Left behind II,"I liked this movie, But it was lacking in several areas. For those of you who like the story line, which is about Revelation in the Bible, I've Got a much better series of movies. They are: Apocolypse (caught in the eye of the storm), Revelation, Tribulation and Apocolypse IV:Judgement.These 4 movies are one story, And they cover the events in much better detail. If you like Special effects, I also recomend Omega Code and Megiddo(Omega code 2) These Two movies star Michael York as the AntiChrist. And he plays it very well. These two movies really keep you on the egde of your seat."
2,Left Behind II should stay left behind!,I purchased Left Behind and Left Behind II. Left Behind left me frustrated with the ending and Left Behind II left me asleep by the end of the movie! The Apocolypse series are much more interesting to watch! I won't be buying Left Behind III. I should have saved my money and bought the book! It would have probably been more interesting.
1,Wow! This is really abominably bad!,"I simply am aghast at how horribly bad this movie is. The acting is flat, lifeless and it is obvious the actors are merely going through the motions. The special effects are laughable. Attempts at suspense are simply ludicrous and the whole plot is simply unbelievable. You should watch this only if someone pays you."
1,"Are you people crazy, this movie is terrible.","I watched the second film the other night. It was by far inferior to the first, and I'm not saying the first was any good. I watched the first one because Mike Severs directed it, however, he only played the lead in the second. If the books are anything like the films than they must be incredibly boring. I remember being leant the first Left Behind book. I think I read maybe two pages, when I shortly discovered that this is a horribly written book whose success feeds itself on the fears of other christians. It has the feel of a third grade research paper of the bible. Man, just read Revelations, don't support Mike's obvious attempt to bring himself into the limelight by pushing his way into the lead character, of a poorly written script, that he certainly cannot pull off. With all that in mind I'll still rent the third one."
5,Superb!,"This is a great DVD that adults and teenagers should see! If your kids are fans of the Left Behind the kids series, then they should see it, too. If you are a fan of DVDs that keep you on the edge of your seat, you should see this! If you are a Christian, then you will definitely like this movie! I find this project very enlightening of what is to come. It is an awesome DVD and you should definitely buy the first DVD and this one, too. It will keep your eyes riveted to the screen until the very end!"
4,A Great Low Budget Family Film!,"The books are fantastic and I was very excited to hear that the movies were being made. The only sad thing is that the budget for films like these are not high, so you don't get the ""matrix"" effects like big budget films. The cast and the rest of the crew did a fantastic job working with the budget they had. I look forward to seeing the same actors play in future Left Behind films."
1,"This long of a wait, and you give us.... WHAT??!?!?!!?","I will have to say, I hated the first one. I got this from the library. It was ok, but it got really cheesy. Especially Tsion Ben-Judah, he was like ""But... isn't Carpathia the Messiah?"" While in the book, he kept hidden his opinions from Buck, and he actually was a believer. Also Chris comitted suicide in the first book, before Rayford even left the ariport in the first book!! The angelic girl was annoying. Just skip this movie and read the books and/or listen the the ""experience in sound and drama"" a great alternative to the movie."
4,very enlightening,I think this video was very enligntening and that the authors are very good in trying to get God's message out to us
3,Improves upon original,"When I watched the first movie I was pretty disappointed. The acting didn't seem natural... but that might have to do with the script and the directing... and the special effects seemed a bit cheesy. I think this Left Behind II was written much, much better than the 1st.(In my humble opinion I will take better writing than special effects any day and Left Behind II delivered!) The part where Chloe is ministering to the fireman on his deathbed made me cry. I think Janaya Stephens is an exceptional actress. (I hope Hollywood can see what a gem she is!) I don't remember that being in the book but I am glad they added it to the movie."
2,I thought this was a movie about the book?,"Who wrote the script? they obviously didn't read the book. where was Chaim and Amanda? Where were the cookie scene and the fact that Buck and Chloe were married by the end of the book? What happened to the outbreak of WW3? where was alice? what happened to the arguements between buck and verna zee? and why, oh why, were two people still alive in that movie that died? bruce dies at the end of tribulation force, chris was dead at the start of left behind! i thought the idea was to protect the integrity of the books?I'm not saying it's necessarily a bad movie, i just wish it would have stayed closer to the books. that is the point after all. but i will say that the acting was good, and although the story wasn't true to its roots, it was overall a decent movie."
1,"Tainted Love Becomes More Tainted, Musically","Club 69 has earned the reputation of making horrible remixes. Let's start with Yaz's ""Don't Go"" and ""Situation"". The remixes for these classic songs were worthless and unnecessary. The same thing has occurred with Soft Cell's ""Tainted Love."" Not only are the beats monotonous, but become boring and tiresome to the ears. I must admit, as a DJ, I like to make mix tapes where two songs mix nicely with similar beats. I was able to mix a remix included in this CD with Depeche Mode's ""Personal Jesus"", as they both sound alike due to the drum background. For this, I give this production one star. Maybe If I had the remix equipment, I could've have done a better job. But for now, for get anything remixed by Club 69. By listening to it, you'll be wasting away your haircells that can be used to hear something more delightful, such as the original release."
2,"The best way to enter into the Linux world, for a beginner.","Mandrake Linux is, without a doubt, the most user-friendly, and probably least flexible, and most kiddyish, and frankly, somewhat idiotic, distribution of Linux there is.Now, let me say that this is the way to go for a beginner, who is looking for above average security, and a good level of every-day functionality (as well as a painless installation).That aside, I must say it's a ripoff to buy and not simply download, partially because there is a lack of decent commercial software, and partially because it's just rather bad as far as programming environments and user-control go. About as bad as Windows in the end.If you choose on going with Linux, and don't mind a bit of kernel configuration during, or after, the installation, I'd go with Slackware, RedHat (though it has a bit more bugs), or at least SuSE. That, or get yourself any distribution of UNIX (they're all good)."
1,Don't Buy!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"These cases suck, As stated in other reviews, they are flimsy and break very easily. Mine looked like they were left on the dash of a car for a year. After contacting seller, all they did was deny that they were broken, and accuse me of leaving false feedback just to get more cases for free. NOT! I don't think so! Why would I want more of your crap! The only offer they made, was to have me ship them back, and mabie they would cover the shipping. Losers! Dont buy from them! Don't leave a poor feedback, for they will be children and just leave you poor feedback as well. Grow up guys!"
1,YOU GET WAY YOU PAY FOR - no good,"Although this product is cheaper than most, you get what you pay for. The cases are flimsy, the locking tabs break off when you open or close the case and the clear cover tears easily. I was only able to use 8 out of 10 in each package (I bought 10 packages). I was VERY dissapointed and will never buy again. Highly recommend you shop around a pay a few dollars more for something that will last."
5,A fine product for heavy duty use,I use this gauge primarily for checking the tires on my motorhome. Dual wheels and 100psi make such a gauge necessary. For my auto a smaller gauge with finer graduations (1 pound incrememts) is more precise but occasionally if I have the Milton in my hand is use it on the car. It is a fine instrument and will probably give several lifetimes of use.I also have a Milton dual foot inflator with a built in gauge. The gauge on that unit reads about 4-5 pounds off so I use it for inflating to an approximate level then finish off with the S976.
2,Not as it appears,"The picture of this gage on Amazon suggests it has dual chucks, and is heavy duty. The s921 is a small, single-chuck automotive gage shown elsewhere on the Amazon site for two bucks less! Best to always check out model numbers with another source before ordering based on a picture."
1,POLITICALLY CORRECT DRECK,"Nothing is more interesting to me than first hand historical accounts. The book description certainly leads one to believe that this is what this book has to offer. It is, however, 82 pages of grandiose fluff with only occassional quotes from actual diaries. The book is classified as ""Women's Studies""; it is, at best, only for children young enough to know nothing of American History."
5,Peeked Interest,"""Heart of the Trail"" is an easy and fast read. If you want to be introduced to wagon train living and some general background this is one to consider. The book presence facts but, not so much as to bog you down. It enlightens you to some of the good times and bad that occurred during the several months of travel for these families heading West. The book is mostly a narrative with occasional quotes from the women's diaries or letters. The map of the trails was a big help in seeing how these travelers made it to their new homelands. This book is one that will either peek your interest to read more or it may be just enough of what you want or need to know."
3,It's Alright,"The Silk Epilator is a nice alternative to waxing because it's a lot cheaper in the long run. Your legs also stay smooth for a while afterwards, just like waxing. Unfortunantely it hurts much more than waxing does. A lot of times I'm tempted to just shave because it hurts a lot. Also, I've been having an excess of ingrown hairs, so after using the epilator, I have to go in with my tweezers and get those too. If you are willing to put up with the pain and the long amount of time it takes to do this, then this product is for you."
5,Excellent!,"Black Genesis is a welcome edition to the storied genre of boxing literature. Never before has there been an accurate book written on the history of the black boxer. Mr. Smith obviously did his homework, using a wide variety of long forgotten sources to deftly craft this fascinating story. I particualrly enjoyed the chapter on the tragic Tom Molineaux and also loved seeing the records of all the fighters in the back of the book. Smith did a very good job in capturing the feel and flavor of bareknuckle fighting as well, using detailed descriptions with the language and terms of the day to capture the grittier aspects of the sport.Overall, with the exception of a few typos, which must have alluded the wandering eye of Mr. Smith's editor, I found the book to be a wholly enlightening, entertaining and exhilirating ride through prizefighting history."
3,A Good Character Study-Not much of a Secret,"Joseph Mitchell takes two looks at the life of Joe Gould, a homeless denizen of NYC's Greenwich Village. From a well-known Massachussetts family and a Harvard grad, Gould lives from day to day on handouts to support his great work; An Oral History of Our Time, a mammoth undertaking which is said by Gould to be the longest book in the world. His story and its eventual sad end is reported by Mitchell with compassion and intelligence. Mitchell tells a solid tale but Gould is such an unlikeable character I felt distanced from him and never truly warmed to the book despite the author's obvious skill. I definitely will try some of his other work where the subject matter is not so limited."
1,Disappointed!,"Expected ""Oh Call Back Yesterday,Bid Time Return"" to echo the movie,""Somewhere In Time""! The book I received had *nothing* to do with thetheme of the movie! I'm not quite sure just what it had to do with anything save some woman's recall of her history in the plains states, or whatever! There was no love story to equal the movie's! A total waste of my time & money. Sorry!"
1,You get what you pay for,"Coby, a Korean company, makes a wide range of very inexpensive electronic products. You can find them at a lot of discount stores here in New York. I have a CD-Player as well as this noise-canceling headset, and I must say I'm happy with neither. Low prices are not necessarily a good thing!The problem with this product is simple: it doesn't really work. I needed something to use on the subway, to help cut down the ambient noise, but the cv190 doesn't do the job. Worst thing is, the sound quality is, how should I put it, totally lacking: flat, no bass, no clarity, the worst kind you can imagine. Even a cheaper Koss or Aiwa would sound infinitely better. Luckily, I got a refund. You can avoid the hassle by staying away from this.As for the CD player I got: it eats Energizer batteries like kimchee, and the ""anti-skip"" circuitry turns Celine Dion into a high-pitched witch."
2,Not Active NC,"Just a note that the CV-190 is not an ""active noise cancelling"" headphone. There are no electronics to reduce ambient noise, just the physical mass of the headphones themselves."
3,Ok...,"A mediocre modern-version remake of the Jungle Book. The story is rushed through, although actions for the voiceovers for the elephant Bono (Robert Quarry), and the tiger Sabre (Ross Hagen) the monkey Mantoo (Jenny Pulos) are good. Otherwise nothing really groundbreaking here.They could have made more of the animals in the movie.The villains where pretty cardboard, but the friendship between Krishna (Asif Mohammed Seth) and Anna (Leah Moreno) was sweet.All in all an entertaining one and half hours, but one of the lesser versions of the Jungle Book saga."
4,Family Moments,"After reading ""Big Annie"", my boys insisted on getting tug boats for Christmas. Then on Christmas morning, they took the rest of the family's presents out from under the tree and ""delivered"" them to each of us on their boats! This was a beautiful way to teach my sons about both Christmas selflessness and our family's history. The songs of the South meet the spirit of Christmas- it's a perfect combination of past and present African American culture."
4,Don't sweat it,"Mr. Chang, don't sweat any negative reviews. This is the book that Hip-Hop's been waiting for. IMHO, Hip-Hop is now in it's ""teen years"" so to speak. We've already gone through all the environmantal discovery that a child goes through, all the playing and such. But now in the teen years we are becoming more aware of ourselves, and Hip-Hop is growing it's own consciousness more than ever. In such a drastically changing time, we need a guide to know where we've been. You'll find that guide/mentor in this book. I've learned more from this book than I have growing up in tha LBC and surrounding areas.This book is essential and vital.We've been talkin it up over at http://www.templeofhiphop.orgAnd as a writer, I love Mr. Chang's use of words and masterful imagery that BOOM! explodes thru the pages.If you want an education, start here.Peace and one luv,~ LordShenhttp://www.thelordshen.com"
5,hip hop wont stop,"if you really want to know the history of Hip hop, pick this book out. it will give you a depth look into. is a long book but is so worth it. you will understand how things came about"
4,a complete history,"Chang's history of hip-hop starts at the beginning (in the 70s) and examines the phenomenon from musical, cultural, and political viewpoints. His main strength is that he refrains from discussing ""current"" events, lest the book become dated too quickly. Indeed, only the last couple of chapters deal with the last ten years, and at that it's a cursory look. Chang's writing is outstanding, if a little too focused on certain acts (Public Enemy seems to take up the entire mid-section of the book), but his depth of knowledge of his subject matter and his manner for conveying it are excellent. His primary weakness is that he has a definite political slant to his work, occasionally dropping his journalistic guard to take shots at right-wing causes/politicians. It doesn't get in the way of the text, but it does get annoying. It's hard to write a history of a person/event/phenomenon that is ongoing that actually seems like a history, but Chang has done an excellent job doing just that."
2,A lot of Info but...,"This book was very informative. It covered a wide range of topics under the umberalla of Hip Hop. It goes deep into the social and political climate, yet I really felt it lacked information concerning raw Hip Hop. It may not be the book, but as someone who wants to learn details about the origins and details oh ""Hip Hop"" I thought it missed the boat. It covered nicely the climate Hip Hop was spawned but left gaps in the development, and after the first early years we move swiflty and only cover sparse events until we arrive at gang warfare on the left coast. What I was looking for was a ""Yes Yes Ya'll"" type of book that concentrated on the early history and development. Mr. Chang's book does incorporate comments and stories from the people who were there but it just wasn't enoguh for me. In essence it was very cerebral and not enough grit for the ""purist""."
2,"Ain't knockin the content, but the author needs work","I'm reading this book for a college hip-hop class, and i like what the book is trying to say, but can't stop getting hung up on, what seems like, the author's inexperience in writing anything longer than a magazine article. I constantly find myself getting caught up on his structural sentence errors. Several times I have had to re-read a sentence so many times that by the time i figure out what it means i have to start the paragraph over again. Like the title says, i'm not saying the author doesn't know his facts, I just wish he knew how to write them."
1,Hated it!,I hate when people who don't know nothing about hip hop associate it wit' gang violence or turf war or being poor. If you want a real book on hip hop buy Fight The Power-The Vibe History of Hiphop-The Hiphop Generation-Hiphop America. Save ya' money on this one.
5,Illuminating,I have been practicing Medicine Buddha mantra for a decade now.... This book has illuminated my practice with extended knowledge and meditations which help me go deeper into this jewel.
2,really disappointing,"I am one of the biggest Andrew Gold fans there is, I love all his album from the 1970's, they were so melodic. His 80's work was also excellent with Wax.This album is practically devoid of all the melodic ballads that he is so well known for. I was stunned as the tuneless 'ain't it just' came on. And 'big fat daddy' is even worse. An awful start to the album.The only songs I like were 'hannah'. The one and only exceptional ballad on the album, which reminds of his earlier style. This would have been one ballad amongst many, but here it is really a stand alone. 'Don't talk about forever' is also nice enough. The other tracks of note are 'the night show'. A good melody shines through this one. Also the cover 'I think I love you' is quite catchy. And 'A little mercy' is an ok sounding ballad.But the rest is tuneless space filling pap.Oh, and I HATE 'Drama queen' it is cringe worthy and just plain awful."
4,Decent tea if price is right,"This is decent tea, I would value the box at $20 but no more. Get it when it's cheap or on special and it's worth it but the tea isn't anything specail."
4,Box in bad condition,"Bought this for a gift - box (wood grain tea chest""?) arrived in poor condition. Other than that - nice assortment of teas."
4,Great little set of teas,"While I was not over-the-moon about the woodgrain box, I purchased this as gift to give tea, not the package. I must say that I found the woodgrain chest/packaging completely appropriate for gift-giving, but if you are looking for a fancy wood tea chest, you should consider purchasing a nice one separately.This selection of teas offers a fairly nice variety. Mine all arrived very fresh with the chest sealed in plastic and the aroma of tea was evident before it was ever even opened. The tea was lightly flavorful and this is the way I like tea, so I'm very happy with my purchase and a gift that everyone can enjoy."
1,Bentley Teas,I am very disappointed in the quality of the teas in that lovely box. They all taste the same! I had never heard of Bentley Tea and don't expect to again. Now what do I do with 120 teabags that have no flavor?The box will make a nice jewelry container when I'm done.
4,Decent,"I bought this for my mom because she always has a hard time organizing her tea collection. The box is not of high quality wood, but it look nice, and the actual tea itself is quite tasty. I really like the red soft finish on the inside. My only problem is that some bigger tea packages don't fit into the slots, I made them fit with a little elbow grease though."
3,Weak tea,"I found the teas to be weaker than those I'm used to, like Twini*** and Sta**.The teas may have been old, they have the stated flavour but not as strong as other the other brands I've bought from Amazon.The box is a laminate, I thought it was plastic till I carved on it to be sure. I did not buy it for the box.A better buy if you think you'd like their tea is the 120 count tin box, twice the tea bags for 50% more money, $30 vs $40."
5,Great gift,"One of the nicest gifts I have found in a long time. We sent it to a 30 yr. old granddaughter recently engaged She loved it as much as I love mine. Will never be without.Bentley's Finest Teas Wood Grain Tea Chest, Variety Pack of 6 Flavors, Tea Bags, 120 Count Box"
2,"Bentley's Finest Teas Wood Grain Tea Chest, Variety Pack of 6 Flavors, Tea Bags, 120-Count Box","The tea was good, But I was looking for a box to keep around for a while and the felt lining hardly hides the fact that it's a cheap particle board box."
3,Nice gift,"I bought this as a gift and read the reviews before buying. It looked really nice when received and the people seemed to like it. I do agree that I was dissapointed about the felt moving away to show the partical box dividers. But I hear the tea is fantastic, so I really hope the box lasts a long time."
3,"Ok, but it is just tea",Tea is not just flavored colored water. Now this is good Americanish tea but it really is not real tea.Box is ok but still cheap when you handle it.
3,Not as good a value!,"Just opened the box and the teas are very aromatic, but the wooden boxis cheaply made and an embarrassment to present to your guests.I hope the teas will be the mitigating factor for this purchase."
3,Too wrinkled,"I loved the poster however when I received it, there was a huge wrinkle that went up the whole poster."
5,great pictures,"Very nice book, pictures and text are informative for all ages, will help with school prodjects. It did come with creases in lower portion of ""paper back"" book, U.S.P.S. did roll it in the mail box, try to order with other products so it is shipped in a box. First time having any problem with shipping from amazon, most likely U.S.P.S. issue."
4,Little Hoot,"There was a lot excellent photographs, but I found the book too short ant not as extensive a collection of the varieties of different species"
5,Keep the Change!,"The video is great. Just seeing Harry perform ""Sniper"" makes this video completely worth it. There is also a short part where Harry takes questions from the audience. I highly recommend this video to any Chapin fan."
3,Not my cup of tea,"There is nothing really wrong with this album technically speaking, and in theory it's a great idea -- taking popular worship songs and 'rockifying' them. And really, overall it works. Opener 'I love the Lord' is a lot of fun, and 'King of King's' is as well. However, I'm not a big fan of songs like 'Friends', which sounds rather bluesy, and the overly synthesized 'Hallowed' and 'Take Me In'.Indeed, this album doesnt' really inspire me all that much. I much rather prefer the more subdued, laidback, and occasionally rocky 'Petra Praise 2' which combines acoustic rock, rock and pop in an interesting vein ... and has very little synths (it's mostly all live). Indeed, maybe that is my main qualm about this album -- the synths take too much priority, and the songs sound a little too similiar to each other.Again, it's a good idea and should make a good album, but it just doesn't work all that well for me."
5,Proof that God loves the 80's.,"This album was my first intro to CCM. I love it, and I'm thinking that God does as well. After all, all, that's the purpose of this music- to worship and praise our God. AND... I know that our God is not tied to a particular style or genre, and I believe this music honors Him, so I think it is good."
2,the issue was the size,"I do want to say that i had no issues with the seller allowing me to return and issuing a refund within a timely manner. I GIVE THE SELLER 5 STARS!!!i was really excited when i found this because my mom is a fan of the original fendi, but me being the dunce that i am, didnt realize that .17 was a sample size, especially considering the price. It smelled perfect and arrived within a few days, but i was completely shocked by the size and price."
5,Perfume,I love this perfume! It is an expensive indulgence which I don`t tend to gravitate to very often! Good for special occasions!
1,"claimed to be ""new"" it was not only not ""new"" it was used!",very disappointed in the sender. I am not even sure it's parfume but rather a very expensive watered down version of the spray. Needless to say I am not a happy camper.
2,Not what I expected at all.,It's difficult to get any perfume out of the tiny bottle. Really not worth buying as a gift. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone.
1,not worth,"this perfume is sample, not for sale. this perfume because fendi is and is rare, some sellers selling it very expensive ."
5,Great Gift for the Student of Legend,"If you or someone you know is a student of Arthurian Legend, this makes a beautiful gift. It is a rich ""Who's Who"" of the various strains of the tales copiously illustrated by the appropriate family trees, facsimiles of medieval illumination, photographs of the historical sites and Pre-Raphaelite reproductions. Lovers of the legend will treasure this book!"
3,A nice set,"I've had this product about a year now. It was a nice set. It has a good range and works fine anywhere inside the house or outside around the house. I've not had any problems with it. Here and there I have to drop it on the base to re-register it or I'll have no dial tone.Sound quality seems fine compared to other devices. However, other people say it sometimes sound unclear or like I'm distant or in a box. I'd say many of the phones of owned recently are along these lines too and worse, so this one I think is better than most.Overall I am satisified with the product. I am a tough consumer because I think in general that products are overpriced and disappointing. I would not make an effort to buy this product again - its adequate but certainly not a great cost or just an amazing product. It servers its purpose but I would not rave about it."
1,Worst cordless phone I have ever seen,"Can't head calling party voice most of the time. No sure I can call it a phone with this behaviorAfter pulling out and putting in battery to reset phone, battery indicator shows all low even though before pulling out it was fully changedRoom monitor is completely useless unless I keep it attached to my ears.Deleting caller Id entry from one handset doesn't delete from other handset. You have to delete manually from both."
2,Terrible Quality Microphone,"This phone has a great feature set for the price. It is ergonomic and feature-rich. The earpiece sound is excellent and the range is quite good for a 5.8 GHz phone. So why only two stars? The microphone makes your voice sound as if you're speaking through a couple of sheets of wax paper.I heard complaints like this against Uniden a couple of years ago, but thought that the obviously capable Uniden R&D; folks must have addressed this relatively simple problem by now. No such luck. If the mic sound was halfway decent, this would be the best buy on the market for an expandable system, but the crummy outgoing audio makes it a sound like a $2.99 special from the local drugstore.This is a good system only if you don't care whether or not others can easily understand you. I sometimes speak to clients on my home phone and can't afford to sound cheap, so I returned mine."
5,Love this Phone System,"Buying a phone these days is complicated. Not only are there lots of choices, but each phone gets both positive and negative reviews. My daughter bought a Uniden phone system similar to the 8860 and kept encouraging us to get it. I spent weeks reading reviews of everything. I finally chose the brand that she had chosen, although her model # is no longer available. This is a great system. Truly ""plug and play"". The menus are simple. It has incredible capabilities. The sound is excellent, including the speakers. These are the best telephones we have ever had in our house. And I was able to go to the office supply store and purchase additional phones for the system at a reasonable price."
4,Great phone at a great price,"My wife and I bought this phone to replace a 2.4 GHz phone. It is exceptionally clear, (I can go outside to my mailbox without a hint of static).We love the features like message waiting light, and the baby monitor feature since we have a newborn in the house. And since it is 5.8 GHz, there won't be any dead spots for our wireless computer network.I don't understand other's saying they don't like how you have to delete the Caller ID on each handset. That is how my old expandable system was. I think it is a good option, since you might delete a number by accident.My only reason for not giving the phone five stars is that we don't know the expected talk and stand-by time. Uniden encourages you to keep the phone on the base between calls, but doesn't tell you how long you can expect the unit to last off the cradle."
1,Nice features but No range,This phone has about a 20 foot range before it starts cutting out. It has great features but you can't really move all about your home.
1,Both units defective,"One of the units works, but has a defective LCD screen, so has no display for caller ID or number dialed. The other unit does not hold a charge so is unusable. Even though these were refurbished units, this was not a good purchase!"
2,"Short lifespan, Mediocre phone","This phone worked okay for the first two years - nothing spectacular. By the third year it began to slowly and painfully die. The batteries held less and less power and eventually you could not use the speaker-phone & mute together or it would shut-off for a second, then return but with mute turned off.I would not buy this phone again."
1,Don't Order,"This trampoline came with a broken part and the handle of the carrier bag ripped as soon as I took it off the folded trampoline. I emailed the company but received NO RESPONSE. There was also no literature included. The mat on which you bounce seems too small, certainly not 40"". The springs show and are not covered by the edging. Wish I had picked another rebounder!!"
2,An adoptive parents reflection of love,"This journal is not at all what I expected. There are pages with questions at the top of each. You fill in the answers to each question. It is more of a ""getting to know your adoptive parents"" guide for your adopted child. I could have easily wrote a summary of my childhood in a much cheaper journal and gotten the same results."
5,"Brilliant, truthful, fun to read!","This book is a reading ""must"" for every person who is involved in the horse business.The author has done a wonderful job of compiling data for every area she covers. Whether you are a beginner, or someone who has chosen to make the equine industry your profession, you will indentify with the many areas that she covers.We can all learn from the contents of this witty book, and enjoy the reading adventure as well."
3,Nor very useful if you have a competent trainer/instructor,"This book contains a lot of personal anecdotes which may comfort the beginning showperson. However, if you have a good trainer/instructor, these questions will occur naturally either to you or to your trainer. Not a very worthwhile investment. Just ask someone you know who has shown!"
3,Good at teaching,This book is good for unexperinced riders. I liked it very much and I think you will to.
1,"No, no, no, no!!!!!!","I bought this film without really knowing a lot about it. I liked the cast so I went for it...Not a good move on my part.This whole film centers around a man who can't sleep, to the point that his body is dying. Okay.I haven't never seen so many good actors try so hard to make a bad film work. This film was poorly directed, written, and it hurts me to see so much talent wasted!I knew I was in trouble as a viewer when I started yelling at the screen, ""DIE ALREADY!""Needless my advice to all who might find this film interesting is; Don't bother."
2,Doesn't seem to work properly.,"I bought one of these, brand new. When I use it with a portable CD Player/Radio on the proper settings for my unit, the radio works for about 15 seconds, then shuts down. Like the other reviewer, I'm wondering if the voltages are off. Will try a meter..."
1,Don't buy it. Smoke coming out of it at the second use.,I used it the first time 3 months ago with my portable DVD player for about 15 minutes and it worked fine then. Yesterday I used it for the second time and it stopped working. I kept it plug in for a few minutes longer while trying to figure out why the power is still not on with the DVD player. The adapter started to get hot and a strange smell came out of the adapter. I immediately unplugged it and I saw smoke coming out of it. I am too scared to use it. It's definitely going to the trash now.
1,Seriously $4 for a tiny piece of plastic?,"I thought I would get a ""single pack"" of severla of these, but literally I got a single one in a giant padded envelope! The scraper works fine, but I am reeling against the fact that this cost $4.15 when my dentist used to give them away for free! Don't waste your money."
1,disappointed,cant hear a thing! save your money and get the more expensive one!! very disappointed!!
5,Good value for a gift,Used this as a graduation gift to nursing students. It was a great price when a number of them was needed.
2,Just a toy,"I think the fisher price doctor kit works better and lasted longer. It won't even stay together and you can't hear a heartbeat. It will work to amplify voice if you talk into it, so my three year old uses it for that."
5,Good read,"I found A GRIZZLY WAY TO DIE to be an engaging story, well told and full of surprises. Author James Corwin captured my interest from the start, and before it was over I had to force myself to put this book down. I found Corwin's characters to be both strong and believable, and I was fascinated by his protagonist's expertise in the unusual skills of tracking and man-trapping. All in all, I was thoroughly entertained by this book."
5,Slam dunk ripping yarn,"From start to finish this book moves like a panther. I couldn't put it down, but I am a sucker for an underdog adventure story. This could be a Die Hard plot, if ever there was one."
5,Good visual deterrent,"I like this because you can see it very well from outside the vehicle. It will deter the 'opportunistic' thief. If someone really wants your car, they will get it no matter what, but this provides a simple level of security. I would recommend this."
4,Entertaining if not a bit Heavy-Handed,"""The Status Civilization"", albeit a quick read, is highly entertaining as a satire and as a bit of science fiction. Scheckley's prose is terse and easy to read, the chapters well cut, and the stroyline quick moving that makes the book impossible to put down. The 150 pages disappear in a blink. The only part of the book that is laborious are the final few chapters, which act as a satire on modern living, and are a bit dense with criticism although tey do employ interesting satiric conventions. As a bit of dystopian/utopian literature, it is well worth reading, especially along side Kurt Vonnegut's ""Player Piano""."
2,Sheckley was better at short fiction than novels,"After reading Sheckley's short stories, this novel just seemed to drag on forever. Though it might have been entertaining in a short story, the premise seems thin for a novel. If you want to read his best work, read:The Masque Of Mananaand leave the novels alone."
3,"Interesting story, little romance","This story is listed under ""romance novel"" but there is surprisingly little romance involved with the story. The romantic aspect of the story is halting and feels a little artificial. The author even stops writing when the ""happily ever after"" part is about to begin. An odd choice, if you ask me. It's largely an artistic story about ancient Greeks, Amazons, and sea-dwelling humanoids. I'd probably label this under ""drama"" and ""fiction"" rather than romance, but it was an interesting read.Go for it!"
1,Poisoning For Profit,"Book was suppose to be in very good condition, but was received in fair condition at best. Very disappointed with purchase."
5,book,"The book was delivered in excellent condition, as described in the add. Delivery was fast. I would definately buy from this seller in the future."
5,Useful reference book,I borrowed this from my library before deciding that I needed to purchase it since I refer to it a few times per year. It has some detail about each type of tree/shrub including when to prune and other species specific info. This and a similar book are my go-to sources.
2,Could Hardly Follow It!,"Did not like the format of the story at all, and just not a good production.....left me speechless it was so badly done...sorry just being honest."
2,much smaller version,This is not the full length book you are probably looking for. This is a very small sampling of the handbook used in most groups.
5,"""Timeless Flight "" is the most beautiful music I ever heard!","If you like music that will take you away to a new dimension and make all your worries just drift away, this is the music for you. I love dancing and even walking to the rythyms of David Blonski! I first heard his kind of music in a little shop in Arcadia Maine several years ago and I never tire of his music. I tracked him down on the Web to buy a copy of it for a friend and it blew her away. It's the perfect escape music to help you either meditate or do Yoga. It's probably the best kept secret on Earth! ""Timeless Flight"" is the most beautiful New Age music you have ever heard! The title song ""Timeless Flight"" makes you feel your really flying and I'm NOT on drugs! No words to the music with this one, but who needs words when you can ""hear emotion"", it will bring out your Muse!"
1,Save Your Money!,"I was having a very difficult time in life and purchased this book among other similiar ones. What a waste of time! None of this works as a matter of fact things got worse! Keep the Faith! That is the only thing that will help, I'm sure!"
2,roller,not very good not as loud as asvertised was very easy to install but not as loud as i would like it good quality horn
4,"Similar to Decks, FX, and a 909","A catchy, more up-beat album, Hawtin's Closer To The Edit is more akin to his seminal Decks, FX, and a 909 album. Cutting up pieces of his favorite tracks into minimal chunks, the album keeps a constant, smooth beat."
5,it just sounds great,"I agree with reviewer John Taft, and I cant improve on his review of this album. hawtin is brilliant, the CD is complex and infinitely interesting, and the style is more mature than anything else i've heard in dance. Most importantly, though- it just sounds great. It's fun to listen to when chillin, cause the beats are so complex that your ears never tire; yet it can still fuel a party with relentless dance-floor rhythm. It may be described as minimal, but really this album just rocks. One of my desert island ten."
2,he does it again?,"Closer to the edit is indeed a flawless mix, there is a competency in every track mix. It is a studio mix not to be mistaken as a live set. There must over 909 editions of this mix, this ordained mix destined as the closer edit itself lives up to ""perfection"". As a long avid fan of his, it is somewhat difficult to reconcile on his old school sound with this cut."
5,The Real Thing,"If you read a lot of self improvement books and find the same information presented again and again, try Robert Anthony's material. All the newer ""gurus"" like Tony Robbins and Joe Vitale blatantly took Robert Anthony's material and re-wrote it. Badly.There may be typos in this particular book, but it's straightforward, easy to read, and is well-written (unlike most of the more modern hype).My daughter is a thirty-eight year old going for her PhD in Psych. She reads everything she can get her hands on regarding self help, self improvement, etc., and she's been complaining that everything is beginning to sound alike. I gave her a copy of Beyond Positive Thinking, and she loved it.Buy this book. Enough said."
5,Really good,I really liked this book. I would recommend it to others. I also plan on reading it again as there was a lot of things the author suggested to do.
5,THIS is the Holy Grail.,"I don't know how to convey how powerful, wise, and rare this book really is. I read hundreds to thousands of books. I've been on a self-improvement quest for decades. Never have I seen a book with this depth and practical power of this one. Not only is it easy to understand, but it works. It's that rare book that you want to give to friends, to help them understand how to take control of their lives and create their own reality. Get this book, and be sure to check out the audio CD's based on it at www.BeyondPositiveThinking.com - Joe Vitale"
5,Great book,This book is really cool IMO. it not only talks about what to do but also shows you how to apply it in real life. but the tells you that it is up to you to do it though. Which I believe is how it should be. I recommend it to anyone who wants to make changes/improvements.
5,THIS BOOK IS UNBELIEVABLY FANTASTIC!!!,"I have read several other positive thinking books. However, this book does a great job at summing up all of the content in the other books in a very clear and concise way. In addition, it includes things that other books dont have, such as the ""Write Your Own Script"" chapter.I have never written a book review, not that I dont feel a lot of books are worthy of a good review, but because I know how powerful this book is and the potential it has to change lives, and I want to encourage EVERYONE who is reading this to BUY THIS BOOK NOW. And not only to buy the book, but to USE AND PRACTICE EVERYTHING IN THE BOOK - NO EXCEPTIONS. If you do so, you will be blown away at the seemingly magical things that happen to you in your life!I hope you do buy the book and I know it will serve you well as long as you USE IT."
1,"Mediocre ideas, horribly written...","This book contains a good deal of helpful information. However, it is riddled with grammatical errors and/or spelling errors that take away from the readability and credibility of the book itself. Many of the ideas are poorly paraphrased concepts from better writers in this genre, like Stephen Covey. At many points in this book, I found the author to contradict himself *cough chapter 7 cough*. Parts of the book are so poorly written that it makes them almost incoherent.I read probably 4-5 books a week, many of them are of this nature, and I found this book to be painstakingly hard to get through. The text is so large I felt like I was reading a book for a first grader.This book is horrible. I wouldn't force it upon my worst enemy (and this is me being as positive about the book as possible)!"
3,Good book but too many grammatical mistakes.,"I would have enjoyed this book, but the numerous grammatical mistakes were distracting. You would think whoever was supposed to edit this book would have caught these errors. Shame on you."
1,don't waste your time,This book was horribly written. The amount of typos are endless. Don't bother buying this book. It is a complete and total waste of time. I wish I had known.
3,helpfull at times,"I found tis book to give alot of help with how to play a bugle, but not well with how to play the diffrent calls. the CD that came with it was not much of any help. the book does not explain a thing about the cd. and the cd does not do it well too"
3,Ehh... depends,"If you are a very maticulous reader, the book is filled with details not likely to be included in other texts. However, the book frequently goes off into random places and is difficult to grasp in terms of defining a concrete timeline. While not an impossible read, the organization and excessive details make this text a bit tedious."
5,Great Series,"This is one of the most fun and intelligently written series that has hit the air in recent years. There is a reason the fanbase is so rabid. Note that this is not a collection from Warner Bros., the rights holder which has not announced any plans for a complete series set. Amazon has chosen to shrinkwrap the separate products together so give buyers that option. (As such, they have limitations on the pricing discount.) The negative reviews out so far have been bashing the product release cycle, ignoring the quality of the product itself. I own the series in this format, purchased individually.Bottom line: if you want well written geeky fun that is equal parts action and comedy, you've found it here. Enjoy!"
1,PRICE??,If you add up the seasons individually it comes to $132 rounded up. How is this whole series on just 4 Discs for almost $40 more??
5,Chuck,I like Sarah Walker. The is a spy story with love elements. I look forward to seeing the original characters coming back.
3,Does the job,"These work just fine, but are a bit thinner than I would like. The older ones I had were of a thinker material. Wish they came in more sizes"
2,Sandwiched within the naive and frivolous fun is a vile disrespect for women,"Some fine performances, sets, cinematography and amusing sequences. Sandwiched within the naive and frivolous fun, though, is a vile disrespect for women that goes even beyond what was routine in the cinema of the time. That Rita Tushingham nearly manages to pull off her character credibly is a credit to her talent."
4,Amusing,"A very light-hearted look at dating in England in the mid nineteen sixties. Although not exactly a ""great"" film, it is very amusing and fun to watch."
1,A great book ...,Just a superb book! Not a bit of deviationism! Excellent for use in re-education! The author is a true member of the vanguard of the proletariat! A University Professor who is also a horny handed son of toil ... Herb is a guy who looks at the facts and sees the dialectical truth as laid out by Moscow!William Z. Foster
3,Hard To Install,"It took me more then an hour to install the holder. I had expected something easy, may be something that would just fit on after putting the screws on the wall. I still fear it might fall any time."
5,Great,"This book has so much information on individual herbs and on herbal mixes. Lists remedies for just about everything. I am a beginner and didn't find it to be ""too much""."
5,The Best Book on Herbology,I've been an herbalist for over 20 years and this book is the best book I've found on herbology. It is a great reference book. You can look up illnesses and it will list what herbs have been historically used for that illness. You can also look up a herb and it will list what illnesses it has been used for. There is also a great reference section on vitamins and on pregnancy.Buy this book!
5,SUPERB!!!,Most detailed and well documented compilation of information regarding the details of the events FOLLOWING the massacre in 1847 in New Mexico I have ever found!
2,Dont waste your money,"As one of the producers who had video reviewed in this book I can only say that the information regarding too many video is false and inaccurate. My Video ""stop in the name of sex"" is described as being composed of outakes from something called ""The Playground"" which accidently was shot at the same location as 'Stop"" but a couple of weeks later. ""Stop in the name of sex"" is shot all on location and is one of my best videos if not the best one.Besides Chronologicaly it was shot way before ""The Playground"". Well I suggest the writer of this book gets his facts straight before going public with this kind of false info. This book is not objective and fair but patronizing to some directors and puts down whoever the writer was not fond of. ""moon over Bangkok"" suffers from simillar inaccuracies. OH well , too bad this book was not printed on softer paper, you would know exactly what to do with it."
1,I quite hated it,"Where to start. I am not one of those ""they didn't stay true to the book"" people. But (and spoiler alert) when you kill off characters simply because you want to... that is ridiculous. The whole film doesn't even make sense in this version. It was a waste of time; a classic turned into mediocre rubbish. Don't bother with it. Read the book. Or rent the 1986 Merchant Ivory film. Or just go for a walk; but certainly don't watch this."
2,I've seen better,"Though I claim A Room With a View as one of my favorite novels, I would never expect a movie to be exactly dead on. And yet, even with lowered expectations, I was highly disappointed in Andrew Davies' adaptation. Not only are the characters somewhat unbelievable (the acting isn't exactly terrible, the writing just seems a bit dodgy), but it turned one of my favorite ""Yes! Life is to be lived!"" stories into something utterly depressing.The plot only roughly keeps to Forster's original, the characters are far from being similar and the ending was absolutely terrible.It's an ok movie if you're out for entertainment, but if you're looking for a good adaptation of a great book, stick with the James Ivory version with Helena Bonham Carter instead. It's much much better."
2,Can't compare to Merchant Ivory,"Having loved the Merchant Ivory production from 1985, I approached this new version apprehensively. I enjoyed the performances of Elaine Cassidy, Rafe Spall and Timothy Spall. I usually love Sophie Thompson, but nobody but Maggie Smith will ever be Charlotte Bartlett for me. Rafe Spall is an improvement over Julian Sands, so I was very disappointed by Andrew Davies' tacked on and very unnecessary ""twist"" at the end. Since the book was written in 1908, there certainly was never anything about WWI. The less-than-90-minute time frame is just too short to really do justice to these classics that PBS is redoing. Seems to ne that the beauty of TV is the freedom to make it as long as it needs to be.I plan to re-read the book and watch the old version a few times to purge the new ending from my memory."
2,Shocked,"I love the novel by Forster, and although I know movies have to leave out parts, nothing disappoints me more than when a screenwriter ADDS parts that were not in the book. I was in shock the whole movie wondering why he had to add so much. The books was excellent. Just tell the story."
2,Extremely Disappointing,"I was so excited to hear that Masterpiece Theatre was doing ""A Room With a View."" It is one of my favorite books, partly because the writing, story, and characters are wonderful, and partly because I just feel good at the end of it. I don't want to trivialize a wonderful piece of literature, but it is a feel good book.This adaptation took most of the joy out of the story. The filming was good, the scenery was beautiful, and the acting wasn't bad, but it lacked anything that made me happy to be watching it. I won't give away the ending, but it killed the whole thing for me. I just left feeling sad. It isn't just that it was not part of the book. I understand when things get changed a little bit because it is a movie and not a book. This however, added nothing to it. It revealed nothing more about the characters or the main themes of the story. It just sapped all of the joy out of the film. Watch the Merchant Ivory production, it was so much better."
2,Like One Of Those Final Plays Of A Game,"This is a novelty release to chronicle the ""new"" Cleveland Browns that is for collector's of such CDs or for fans who need every possible team-related item.There are snippets from major events surrounding the formation of the team and highlights from previous years, interspersed with music from a variety of genres/artists. It is this lack of focus that what makes the presentation more like a desperate throw into the endzone as time expires than a calculated drive to paydirt.The concept should have been based on Cleveland artists, with a few more choice audio cuts surrounding the return of the team. Then it would have truly been a nice salute to a special time in Cleveland/NFL history."
2,music to remember,"Music to Forget, I was ready to enjoy but what a surprise these songs were not the ones I remember hearing on the radio, if you like the originals Don't Buy."
5,Historians and bridge-lovers will enjoy this book.,"As an amateur historian, and fan of covered bridges, I found this book fascinating. There are at least 2 (and usually 3) old photos on each page. How fascinating it was to see bridges that I've driven across or seen on my travels around PA as they appeared 100 years ago. It's especially cool to see a covered bridge once stood where a steel bridge stands today. Included is a review of railroad and canal bridges."
1,Not For Everyone,"One of the many spoofs of ""Star Wars"" and the films it inspired, this one doesn't work for me. I get it, but I only chuckled twice and grinned once. I understand that the ineptness was deliberate, but the bad timing on the delivery of the jokes, which might have also been intentional, just made me groan.Based on most of the other reviews, I'm in the minority here. That's OK, but if you're considering purchasing or renting this one, consider the other movies the lovers of this one also liked. If you don't love two or more, you might want to skip this one."
3,classic cheesy sci-fi,Classic cheesy Sci-Fi that is fun to watch and enjoy. The rapid aging part is funny as heck. It was worth the purchase for humor.
4,This movie is ridiculous!,Funny... crazy... you might want to be sure to watch it first before you buy it... its terrible B movie material but so bad it's actually good!
4,A good laugh without guilt.,"It isn't Star Wars but, hey, it isn't pretending to be! It's pure fun with a great cast of lovable characters (Angelica Houston and Ron Pearlman, just to mention a few). The actors are having fun and you can't help but join them. This is a movie to watch with a group of friends - sit back and enjoy the ride. Science fiction at it's silliest but entertaining and endearing all the same. And who couldn't love the hilarious costumes the actors (and actresses) wear without shame. It's pure cheese and...you'll love every minute."
3,HILARIOUS!!!!!!,"I saw this movie MANY times on cable TV in the early-mid 1980s; one of the FUNNIEST movies, in a lame, stupid way, that I have EVER seen!!!!Yep, the ""Space-Herpy"" scene is priceless...This movie is exceptionally funny as some of the lead cast were not really comedy actors, but they pulled it off well!"
2,Sci-fi Pirates,"Not quite what I remembered it was like. Dont place to high of an expectation on the movie. It might have been good in its day, but todays standards really make it look amaturish."
2,Ice Pirates,"Movie just wasn't as funny as I remembered it to be, probably because that was so long ago."
2,Christmas White Elephant,So bad it's good (in the right situation) I watched it once then put it in the family white elephant trade off. I got one of those barrels of different flavored popcorn for it! About equal in my view.
2,Drive-In Movie,"This must be the original movie before "" Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy"". Science Fiction? I rather make out......"
1,It was awful,"I'm a big scifi fan. I'm also an Angelica Houston and Robert Urich fan: but what happened. That was the stupidest movie. I didn't laugh once. It was painful to watch. I was working a double shift when it came on at 3am. The woman I was working with loved it and wouldn't let me change the channel, no matter how much I pleaded. Here's the weird part. She doesn't even like science fiction. I guess this movie is for aquired tastes. Too violent, too silly, too cheesy and too boring for my taste."
3,Cheesy but entertaining,This was cheesy movie making at its finest. But it is worth watching. Some funny moments and entertaining.
5,One of the BETTER SCI-FI B Movies,"A Very Corny,But Entertaining Movie To While Away The Hours. It Has A Plot Line,Which Many B-Movies Just Seem to be Made of Slap-Stick and EFFECTS!!Robert Urich seems to be playing the role ""to the hilt"",while it seems like Mary Crosby was only filmed when she wasn't laughing her head off!!!Anjelica Huston seem to be playing her role,as if it would be her LAST MOVIE,just a little too seriously.While the late John Matuszak was having FUN!!!"
2,Lovely but uncomfortable,"This shoe has a very beautiful design, especally the low graceful heel. The leather is top quality and the shoe is well constructed. However, the toe was far too pointed and was terribly uncomfortable. I was unable to wear the shoes and had to return them."
1,Les 'orribles,"This book is a pity. Guy Windsor's ""The Swordman's Companion"" available from Amazon is a much, much better book. As has already been mentioned, this Medieval Swordsmanship is a horrid composition that has some technique and information, but highly disjointed and the filler between these bits is nonsensical diatribe firing off at a number of groups. In some respects, it is good that Clements wrote this book; he made mistakes that other writers in the Western Martial Arts community learned from. However, in reading his book, one has the impression that the majority of his failings would be repeated if he could write it again, out of sheer refusal to admit when he is simply wrong or ignorant."
2,Have to agree ...,"... there are much better books on this subject available today - Tobler, etc. Clements' work is well illustrated - good use of diagram figures, etc. - but it's disorganised and he wastes reams of paper slamming fencers, Hollywood, and everyone else who's ever picked up a sword."
2,"It's pretty good, would be better without all the knocking!","This is one of those ""love it or hate it"" books depending on how much of John Clements' style you can take. I really like the idea of a martial art based on medeival sword fighting, but Mr. Clements does waste a lot of time knocking other people. I think he is just so into what he's doing that he thinks everyone else is trying to do the same thing and getting it wrong. However, fantasy game players are not trying to do martial arts, they are just having fun! Evereyone knows that movie actors aren't really fighting, they are just acting! Parts of this book do came across like advertising for HACA, but that's fair enough. The pictures are good and there is a lot of information in this book that was new to me. I just wish he had stuck to the point. This book is not very organised and contains too much knocking!!"
2,A lost chance,"The idea was great and this could have been a really good book for beginners in medieval fencing.Unfortunately with the bad editing, the boring blundering about what other people are doing, the unfounded knowledge in the historic circumstances and largescale warfare and with complete disregard of naming sources it proves to be not very worthy for someone who wants to do meore historic than hitting each other with buffer-weapons.It might be a good idea to work the whole thing over (maybe with one of the shunned historians), get some reasonable lector and put the text down to half of its length by throwing away all emotional and non helping ranterings and filling the gaps with naming the sources.THEN it maybe would do, what it's intended to and gets more than an anti-everything pamphlet of his martial arts group.There are enough rivalries in the asian martial arts. Please try not to start the same, enerving stuff with the ""medieval"" martial arts."
4,A New Approach to an Old Discussion,"What were medieval swordsmen really like? Clements seeks to answer this question in this book. This is a very straightforward, no punches pulled look at what we see around us regarding this issue. There are times when his approach to debunking commonly misheld truths can be abrasive, but this seems to be an excellent resource for those who truly want to know how the sword (and a few other weapons) were used before the Renaissance"
3,May jeapordize your chances for sex with normal girls...,"This is a great book to dork out to and *almost* an excellent writers resource, but some of the techniques espoused seem to be taken verbatim from source material without much thought given to the realities of combat.Alternately this book doubles as a great source for sideways glances and ""D&D;"" jokes from girls who have no interest in this sort of thing."
4,Medieval Swordsmanship: Illustrated Methods and Techniques,A very usefull book with a very good weapon histiry. Good research in both Italian and German longsword and also sword & shield.
3,"Definitely outdated, but still useful for seeing how far we've come","The content of the book was actually good for it's time. However you gotta consider how slow the publishing industry goes vs. the advancement of these martial arts. By the time it finally hit shelves after years in the publishing process, it was already rather dated.(Like David Lindholm's ""Knightly Art of the Longsword"", and Christian Henry Tobler's ""Secrets of Medieval Swordsmanship"": both of which are only useful for their text facsimile of Ringeck's commentaries. Although no one singles them out for trivial personal reasons.)While it's definitely not the best resource out there for someone looking for up-to-date instruction of fencing, it's still a cool ""time capsule"" of sorts showing how far the whole field of Historical European Martial Arts have come since the early 2000's."
3,A little lighter on the diatribes please..,"A good introductory text for the field, which until very recently lacked any sort of instructional manuels. Since the time of its publication, and as research in the field has expanded, some of the information appears a bit dated and inadequate. A (further) revised edition would probably be in order.My greatest complaint, however, is the amount of ink wasted lambasting ""certain rattan-fencing groups."" Well, by that he means the SCA, which is fine, their fencing is decidedly not historically accurate, but the paper spent criticising them could have been better spent on useful, instructional material. In places Clements' vitriol sounds like George Silver foaming at the mouth about Italian rapiers.I'd love to see a new, updated edition, removing the diatribes about the SCA (which, to me, read like a defense or justification for this book...) and replacing that with solid, up-to-date, instructional materials."
3,hmmm....,"Well, I guess this is better than his last book (it is more in line with his expertise), but once again Mr. Clements gives us a lot of generalizations and a lot of non-specific advice. Given the state of resurrection of the Western Martial Arts, I'd say that you're better off with direct translations and interpretations of historical works (Christian Tobler's ""Secrets of German Medieval Swordsmanship"" is one example) or general interpretive pedagogies (Guy Windsor's ""The Swordsman's Companion""). However, for those SCA guys looking to find some quick, practical advice so that they can ""jump right in,"" then this is the book for you--it has just enough advice to get you going..."
2,Groan... if only not for the tone,"This book contains a whole lot of good information. The challenge is wading through the arrogant, condescending writing style. Yes, SCA fighters don't practice a ""real"" fighting art. For that matter, neither do Olympic fencers, boxers, or anyone else who competes in a rule-based tournament. After all, the law frowns on killing your opponent in a sporting competition. The historical references are quite good and the topic is interesting, even insightful, but I just can't handle the writing style. If Clements could lighten up a bit I'd rate this much higher...Lawrence KaneAuthor of Surviving Armed Assaults, The Way of Kata, and Martial Arts Instruction"
1,Pleaswe read this before you buy...,"Wow. This book is going to get someone hurt. Bad. In looking at his little stick figures, two things I find:1) It is difficult to figure what exactly is supposed to be happening here in each ""technique"",2)In the sword training that I received (not saying I'm a master, now), in the Kukishinden ryu, sword fights happen in 3 dimensions, not one, and that is where I feel Clements makes his biggest and most dangerous mistake: all I have ever seen him move in is one dimension: back and forth. This book reflects this.This trash belongs on the trash heap, where it won't get anyone hurt.P.S. this review may not mean a thing as the Kukishinden ryu of swordplay is for the battlefield. It is actual combat with a sword. This book suggests dueling."
2,"good, bad and indifferent...","I bet he wishes he could re-write this without the bitching and winging. Some good work ruined by lack of focus and opinionated ideas. Re-worked, this could make a pretty good starters book. Tobler's book is much better I'm afraid. (Secrets of German Medieval Swordsmanship)"
3,SRT-Diver!,"Well the books i okay. Maybe my own fault but I was expecting a lot more on ""surface breaking"" how to going up from water and secure and also on take yourself up on ships -assaults. Lonsdale goes into this but only meantion it. I know understand that it is a lot more when it come to SRT diving. Lonsdale cover everything like HAZMAT diving, Photography,Investigation & Recovery etc. He also give some ideas on equipment, which is good. What is really good is EOD hull search and underwater search techniques. The book is not bad, but like I said I was expecting more on the assautl tactics chapters -so 3 stars. 4 stars if something is really good -5 star.. then it should be really outstanding and that I haven't found yet."
5,"Great for me, DIE HARD hockey fan!","I am a die hard hockey fan and I love the Wings, Hawks, and Leafs! This is a great CD for someone trying to start a collection of hockey cds or just a collection. If you like any sports music like ESPN types you will love this, even if you aren't a hockey fan...... Buy it, TRUST ME it WON'T be a mistake! You'll love it."
5,Houde of Sand,"A beautifully photographed and moving saga of three generations of women, Waddington's ""Sand"" begins in 1910 and fast-forwards to 1919, 1942, and finally the Space Age, tracking Áurea's trials with her impetuous daughter Maria (Camilla Facundes), who longs for a life beyond the dunes. Over the decades, Áurea's experience will be shaped by death, tragedy, war, and romance with an astronomer, Luiz (Enrique Diaz), who seems to hold the promise of escape. Early on, she also receives help from Massu (Seu Jorge), one of the wary ex-slaves living nearby. Flawlessly acted, ""Sand"" is an ode to women's otherworldly strength. Note: the film really is a family affair- Montenegro and Torres are real life mother and daughter, and respectively, mother-in-law and wife of the director."
3,foreign movie,"didn't enjoy too much, but was my fault for not researching as well as I should of before purchasing."
4,Nice trick with double roles,"I was a bit fooled at first by the shifting role playing by the two women and the young girl. I thought I was watching some type of fantasy at first. Then I slowly realized that time had passed, and the daughter was now the older woman, etc etc. If you watch this, you will know what I mean. There's no great moral to this tale, I didn't think. It takes us to a place in Brazil where we will never go. Long periods of time pass. I enjoyed this."
5,SANDS OF TIME,"In 1910, a woman and her mother are stranded in the Brazilian desert, and are forced to make a home out of a house, far from modern civilization, which is literally sinking in the sand. Director Andrucha Waddington's allegorical sand swept domestic epic of a woman searching for a home where the heart is, moves through three generations of hardship, lust and love, and the pursuit of a freedom as evident and unreachable as the moon. Fernanda Montenegro and Fernanda Torres make a compelling mother and daughter team, (in real life they are indeed mother and daughter), and aside from an unconvincing account of a girl becoming an aimless, boozing flirt, after witnessing a lovemaking session with mommy and stepdad, the film is a beauty, probing gently into one's time and place on our civilized planet."
5,$30+ !??,just wondering why this is so expensive here?? I got this off her site months ago for like $8.that said...its worth $35!!
1,Are you kidding me?,"This book is far from Ultimate! The authors of this ""guide"" assume that a)you've never been to a wedding b)you must have a super-traditional wedding, and c) you have all the time in the world to fill out page after page of worksheets. You can tell a wedding coordinator wrote this book, because they imply in several places that you simply must hire a professional coordinator because you know nothing about weddings and they know everything. They also suggest that the best way to cut down on a the dress cost is to find someone getting married the same year and share a dress!! Seriously? This book is not for the modern bride."
1,dissapointed,"When I recived item ordered, it was cute, it looked like what I wanted, but it was broken. The fairy dancer that was suppose to be standing was broken off. It was a Christmas gift, I was dissappointed."
2,Poor quality.,Paper peeling off. Looks better in the photo that it does when it arrives. Not durable at all. I returned it.
3,Pretty but..,"My daughter really likes the box. It's pretty and seems to be made of reasonably durable cardboard, for the price. My quibble is with the drawers. The side drawers are really small; none of my 3 year old's age-appropriate jewelry fits in them. Bigger issue is that the drawers fall out really easily (there's no catch to keep them from sliding totally out), and she can't get them back in herself. Bottom line, I kind of wish I had purchased the more basic box. But, it is pretty, and she also loves the music."
4,Beautiful and well made,"I brought this along with the ""Mia"" ballerina jewelry box and even though at the time I paid the same price..this was by far the better purchase. It is beautiful, well made and well worth the price which is not much. I regret not ordering three of these and ordering the other box (see my review) Big Difference!"
3,Cute but not very sturdy,"The jewelry box is smaller than I thought it would be and the construction is not that great. The drawer stops are glued in with weak adhesive so if you pull the drawer at an angle, it comes right off. The graphics on it are very cute, though and the music is nice. Probably best for a 6-10 year old."
3,Just in case Music,I bought this for my granddaughter for part of her Christmas gift. She loves playing the music. I was a little disappointed in the quality of the jewelry box for the price. My daughter had thought of purchasing it for two of her nieces and I called her and told her not to.
1,A waste of money,I bought this on Amazon's recommendation when I purchased an OBD II reader here. The book is just a list of every car's code followed by a one sentence description. The OBD II reader provides the same information in its user's manual and online documentation. Hopefully you read this before you spend any money on this item.
3,Not as extensive as hoped,I bought this in conjunction with the Equus 3100c. I checked my fault code on my car to find it was not listed in the book nor was it listed in my factory service manual. The software included with the Equus 3100c had the complete information regarding the code. Perhaps this is an isolated instance but now I question whether the book is needed.
5,4000 fault codes in one place!,"Yes, it has over 4000 fault codes, unbelievable. This book is great for me because I work on cars (family and friends) on the weekend, and spare time. My fault code reader shows me the fault code and no text. I could go online and check what the faults mean, but the internet doesn't go where I am, plus not one site has a complete list. This book has helped me get the code definitions to repair what is wrong with the car. OBD II Diagnostics Secrets Reveled and this book has helped me go to the next level in fixing cars. I recommend this book to anyone who needs a Complete reference of OBD II fault codes. Great Book!"
3,OBD II Diagnostic Fault Codes,"This book, valuable as it may be, should have been included with it's sister book The OBDII Bible by the same author.As it covers the major European and Japanese models, it is certainly worth having."
2,google it,"i agree with the other reviewer - start by searching for ""obd ii fault codes"" - think about buying the book only if that fails to give you the info you need."
3,Not what I expected - but still ok,"It's going to take me a while to work through this entire DVD, not just because of the length but also the increasing intensity of the sequences. Basically, there are three levels (beginner, intermediate, challenging) with a variety of practices under each level. For instance, energize...there is a beginner, intermediate and challenging. Not only do they vary in intensity but also in length, each practice getting longer as you progress to the next level.This would be better if it would allow me to create my own sequences from the variety that they piecemeal together rather than only do the preselected workouts they have created. This is my only complaint because sometimes I would like to do the more vigorous vinyasas but dont have the 60-120 minutes to do the preset practice that these sequences are built into."
4,Great Yoga video!,"My friend and I are both beginners and found some of the routines to be a little bit difficult at first, but with practice we have seen and felt amazing results. We both find it fun to try more challenging positions. She has also had her 3 children ages 5,7, and 9 do some routines and said that they also enjoyed them! Having so many different routines on this one video makes it extremely versatile! We look forward to Yoga Wednsdays every week!!"
5,Wonderful for beginners and not so beginners,"I was looking for something to do with my Pilates workout (I have a Pilates DVD from this company and love it) so I got this DVD. It is fantastic in its own right. It moves with meticulous care through the poses so I never feel lost and I can really concentrate on my breathing and opening my body. Because the teacher holds the poses for a nice amount of time I can feel my body opening more and getting stronger. I also love her voice, it lilts so wonderfully. Highly recommended!"
2,A Little Too Slow For Me,"I am an at-home yoga practitioner without formal instruction. However, considering other yoga instructional videos (which include a few from Giam) this one is definitely not my favorite. There are many choices in workouts, which I commend them for, but the environment is sterile (like hospital yoga) and the music is a little aggravating. The video does not have flow between segments. Overall, a bit boring, sterile environment and choppy delivery. I guess my favorite part is savasana, but, of course, that is always the best part."
5,My favorite Yoga workout,"Of all the yoga DVDs I have tried, this one is my favorite. Although slow paced, by going slower, your workout is actually more intense - yet more relaxing at the same time. There are excellent pointers throughout to polish your technique. But the number one reason this is my favorite? The many choices of workouts ie duration or intensity, invigorating vs relaxing. And there are over 20 of them. By far beats the silly competitors who have only 2 or 3 workouts on them. This is one DVD you will always use. Oh, and the veiw of the sculpted man while working out is definitely a bonus ;)"
2,Wasn't what I had hoped for,"I purchased this dvd based on the reviews here. While it looked very promising with an accessible menu and many programs like my favorite entry level dvd by JJ Gormley, I quickly realized how repetitive and boring this dvd really is. I bought this because I was ready to move to more challenging exercises. There seems to be a concentration on the same movements and poses and they drraaaagggg ever so slowly through each and every program. This dvd would best be suited for entry level newbies to yoga. I feel my money was wasted and I cringe at the same poses over and over to the point where I probably won't be using this dvd much."
3,"It's OK, wasn't what I was looking for","I am an intermediate yoga student but found even the challenging routines on this video to be a little slow and repeating the same few poses. However, this is my fault for not reading closely because it says ""Slow Flow"" right on the back of the DVD. It still gives a good strength workout and the morning and bedtime routines were relaxing. But I would buy a different DVD if you are looking for a faster pace/faster flow."
2,One BIG flaw!,"This DVD has one BIG (so to speak) flaw. The man demonstrating the routine is wearing shorts which leave NOTHING to the imagination. Don't get me wrong; I congratulate him for being so well endowed, but I don't want to look at that while I'm trying to clear my mind and follow a yoga (or any workout) routine. Otherwise, it's a good routine, so you may want to pick this DVD up if you're into that sort of thing. I personally can't watch it."
3,Too Slow,"If you don't mind a really long and slow warm up and slow poses, then you might like this power yoga workout. It seems like it took 10-15 minutes just to get to the ""good stuff"". As others have said, I also didn't like having to have straps and such."
2,boring,"i guess i'm just a bigger fan of a little more upbeat yoga practice, although i understand its supposed to be for serenity more than working up a sweat. Good for those who are looking to slowing enhance their skills, but monotonous for those who just want to stretch and relieve tension.The man doing the poses bones stick out to kind of a disgusting level. It made me feel uncomfortable."
1,didn't like this video,I didn't care for this video at all. Boring and it moves too slowly for my taste. I have other videos i like alot better .
2,it won't play,"Hello retailer,Today was the first day for me to try this new Yoga DVD. I was so excited because it stated that there were multiple routines. Unfortunately, when I tried the prompt for each level (Beginner, Intermediate, and Advanced,) the routines would not play at all. Please help me this and write back at your earliest convenience so we can fix this. ThanksDiane Yee"
3,Many workouts but slow and with depressing atmosphere,"The DVD has really a lot of workouts for 3 categories: beginners, intermediate and advanced. However it is not my favorite because the poses are repetitive and really slow. Most depressing of all is the dark green-gray room where all the workouts are filmed. It just puts you in some bad mood. I like Rodney Yee's or Ali MacGraw's beautiful background nature because it relaxes you."
5,Love This Video,"A great video to work with if you want to try a power yoga workout that one that strengthens you with proper positioning and movement that really works will.It has routines for all levels of people, whether you are a beginner or more learned yoga person who needs things that are a bit more challenging. The moves are not hurky jerky or fast, instead the movements are geared to really increase power by controlled movements.I have definately felt progress working with this one and the person performing the moves is really good as is the intructor."
3,very informative but a little overdone,"I was never that interested in the same-sex marriage debate until I learned of the legal protections that are automatically granted straight people when they marry. Graff's history of marriage is very illuminating and her argument for same-sex marriage is persuasive, but she does tend to beat the reader over the head with it at times. Similarly, I enjoyed Graff's biting witticisms but also found it was overdone at times."
5,"A wonderful, well-researched read","This is a great book. It is not only well-researched, but also witty, insightful, and a very engaging read. It's impressive how accessible Graff has made this material; there's a lot of very detailed information packed into a small book, but it's never dry or difficult to read. Her arguments in favor of same-sex marriage are thoughtful and very well-reasoned -- I now feel much better prepared for discussing same-sex marriage with family and friends."
3,Bought for an Activity at a Harry Potter Birthday Party,"The coloring book was fine. At my son's Harry Potter birthday party, I carefully tore out pages for those kids who wanted to color but many (6-7-year-olds) chose not to. It came with maybe four crayons, but I have an almost infinite supply, so no matter. I think this was a little young and not realistic enought for 7-year-olds--maybe better for younger kids who enjoy coloring and Harry Potter."
5,Jeremy Brett's genius,"This book gives the reader an unique perspective into Jeremy Brett's talent and genius. His portrayal of the master sleuth is one of the best in the world even though his own nature was the sort to never ""cross the street"" to meet Sherlock Holmes if he were a real person. Brett's acting abilities are partially displayed to its true immensity in this book. Finally, a book that gives Jeremy Brett the credit he so rightfully deserved and deserves."
5,Must Buy,This is a great book for any Nirvana fans. You can see that the publishers have put a lot of effort into it and the tabs are 100% correct.
1,Can't wait for my stanley glue gun to arrive,"This thing didn't work out of the box. no way to get glue in or out. a few websites suggest putting the metal bit in the oven or heating with a hair dryer. but come on! not working as intended? that is bogus. having had glue guns before, this was a major let down"
2,Does not take standard/craft size glue sticks,"I bought this as a replacement for my girlfriend's glue gun that broke. It doesn't say in the product description, but you can not use standard size or craft size glue sticks in this gun. It takes only the fatter size ones. I asked why she couldn't just buy larger craft glue sticks? I didn't get it, but she said it just wouldn't work for why she needed it. Just wanted to warn anyone that wanted a glue gun for smaller projects that this is not the right choice."
3,could of bought a cheaper one at same quality,"not up to the standards of other arrow products, have had 2 weeks and already having to force feed the glue"
5,Predictable but amazing....,"I say predictable because BoC don't seem to have progressed much from the absolutely gorgeous masterpiece of Music Has The Right To Children. But, don't take this as a warning, but as a blessing, because this is a good thing. This ingenious album plays out like a soundtrack, from mellow beginning to silent end. Geogaddi's strong points (in my opinion) are definitely ""Music Is Math"", ""Gyroscope"", ""1969"", ""The Beach At Redpoint"", and ""You Could Feel The Sky"". I haven't quite grasped the point of ""Magic Window"", which is nothing but silence, but I'm sure Marcus and Michael are making some kind of statement...or I'm just dense.Beautiful, eerie, and a bit dark and melancholic at times, Geogaddi is another masterpiece from the musical geniuses only known as Boards of Canada."
4,"GOOD, BUT NOT AS GREAT AS MHTRTC!!!","Unlike the utterly brilliant ""Music Has the Right To Children"", ""Geogaddi"" is very slow and bleak, and the tracks/segues tend to meander a bit too much and too long before a beat finally comes in. Talk about uneasy listening, this puppy is it! ""Geogaddi"" may come across as ""eerie"" or ""disturbing"" or even ""evil"" at first listen to some, but it is, in fact, a contemplative effort designed (I guess) to chill you out. Inducing paranoia in ones mind it will do (I still feel like somebody's watching me!), but I don't think you will be brainwashed to worship the Devil or go out out and kill anyone after listening to it. ""Geogaddi"" pales in comparison to ""Music has the Right to Children,"" which had better grooves and more consistency. If you're curious about these guys like I was, please buy ""MHTRTC"" first and, get ""Geogaddi"" and Boards of Canda's other stuff later."
5,filmstrip-hop,"November 12, 1982....I remember sitting in science class,the lights all dimmed, the shade pulled down as well as the projector screen. The filmstrip machine beeped and advanced a frame. Ms. Davis had the volume of the tape loud so that we could all hear it and all it did was distort the synthesized music... I learned about gravity, molecules, fulcrums, mass and chloropyll.Boards of Canada brings me back to that scene every time I listen."
3,metal machine musick,"Apparently B. O. C. wanted this album to sound like it was recorded before the one before it. It does sound a bit like Twoism, but it really isn't the same, better or worse. The best tracks is ""In the Annexe"" and ""I saw drones"". Most of it, the album, is pretty self indulgent (or is it? time will tell), although Magic Window, however Philip Glass it may seem, sounds entirely different-- i hear sirens, clicks, breathing, humming, and the heating."
4,It takes time,"Don't expect to put on this album and be blown away. Reading the reviews and high marks, expectations are high.Everyone who awards this CD rave reviews has been listening to it for a while - and let it sink in. At first I thought it was repetitive and uninteresting, but I found myself playing it more and more.It's like this: the first listen is overhearing a child humming to himself while he plays. Repeated listenings is stepping into the child's head and experiencing the concocted symphonies from the inside."
5,BoC is legend,"Boards of Canada has a very nostalgic kind of ring to the music. its kind of creepy, but in literally the best possible way. love this album, love the brothers, and love the fact that I have never heard a BoC song that I did not enjoy."
3,dissapointment,"as a fan of nearly all of the warprecords related artists(tom jenkinson,r.d.james,most of replex crew)and a music listener delighted by b.o.c's debut ""music has right to the children"" album i must say im really dissapointed with geogaddi.dont get me wrong this album still has that warm nostalgia feeling with some really deep emotional touches here and there but compared to their first release programming really falls short.take a downtempo idm beat absolutely going nowhere(nowhere close to ""oh my god the beat is alive"" autechre:),add always welcome b.o.c style syth base line,plus soft&touching sapmles and there you go: 60 minutes of artificial intelligence....i don't think so.if you never heard of b.o.c don't even think for a second get music has right to the children,if you did but never heard of aphex twin's selected ambient works 1,get the purest music after bach on the planet."
3,"Good, but not as good as its predecessor","There are some true gems on this album, most notably ""1969"". On the whole though, it falls a bit short when compared to its predecessor. ""Music Has The Right To Children"" had more focus, leading to musically more intricate moments. This album seems to consist of more filler. I also sense a strained effort to make this album more dark and moody, which at times actually sounds a bit hokey."
4,very unconventional,"When I was younger I used to discuss with my friends who was the best guitarrist or the best drummer or the best pianist. Things have changed these days with electronic music. Can you really rate a musician for how skillfully he presses the keys of his computer's keyboard? What I mean is that rating electronic music doesn't go any further than applying the scale of really good to really bad or simple quality comments such as danceable, hip, boring, etc. So how can you criticize this CD? You can criticize it by simply saying: ""I really like it, it's awesome"" or ""this is not music, it's freaking weird"". I am in the middle of these two opinions. I like it and find it innovating but it doesn't really convince me 100% and sometimes the beats and the monotony get on my nerves and I hate having to skip tracks on a CD. But try it, I recommend it if you like adventuring into the world of electronic music. If you are looking for dance music don't even get close!"
4,Unique,"Not knowing what to expect or being the first to discover a group is always fun. You have never heard music like Geogaddi, Boards of Canada before. You will get hooked the first time you here any of their songs, they are all along the same lines, but are all even more unique than the one before it. If want you to know atleast something about their music the only way I can describe it is try to put ""mood music with a rave mix"". It is it's own sound, but it's very addicting. See for yourself."
5,Geogaddi,"single best ever complete/concept album.just perfect reflection of what 'fresh' meant in the electronica/warp/skam music scene in uk's 90's and 00's, and a beautiful dark fantasy puzzle of an album, a dream a recorded history of the 60's and 70's, an aesthetic sinister in its own paranoia and innocence.And a satanic undertone to boot.Every electronica fan's 'essential' item."
5,Great album!,"Solid, excellent recording! Electronic with an ambient edge. All of their albums are fantastic!"
5,Boards Of Canada....It's All About Salad Fingers,"I got hooked on Boards Of Canada after checking out the ""Salad Fingers"" videos, they do sum deep music and I digg that it is different! I usually listen to rap but I own a record company so I try to touch bases with all music and this is a great CD. A new sound (to me at least) that I can mos def. get into. Just check it out and DON'T BE SCARED OF SOMETHING NEW!!!!Beware The Friendly Stranger (HOTT TRACK, Best 1 On There)-Salad Fingers 4 Life"
2,Their debut ... all over again.,"This album is so much like their first release that it can only be called a disappointment. The sound is much the same: that 70s organ mixed with choppy, hip-hop beats. The structure of the album is almost identical. By that I mean that long tracks are interspersed with short ones just like their debut. The trippy vocal samples are added in much the same way as well. Heck it's as if they set out to make an updated version of their debut.Musically and creatively a disappointing effort.Those familiar with the back catalog are likely to be disappointed. Those new to Boards will likely love it, but that's because lack the context necessary to see the album in this light."
3,Better music available--hype is as usual misleading,"This CD is ok, that's about it--aphex twin and squarepusher blow this stuff out of the water, and although the comparison is not really fair, they are even on the same LABEL. I thought the pace of the songs is what frustrated me--the percussion and overall laying sound slightly amateur, I've done similar stuff with SF/ACID in a really short amount of time"
2,Beep-Beep-Boop-Boop...Thanks but No Thanks,"I like off-beat music, but this ""music"" is too much! This CD sounds more like a test pattern than modern music. I'll pass on this one and others like it."
3,Warm but Bulky!,"These gloves are very warm, but I wish they allowed my fingers to pick up small objects, such as my car keys. This task is nearly impossible with these bulky gloves on. When the temperatures were 11 degrees below zero, they keep all my fingers and hands warm while waiting for the heater in the car to warm up.(approx. 10 minutes)"
5,Surprising great value,"I liked the price for this basic cold weather glove, and am glad that I purchased two pairs, as they are very warm, just as other reviewers had written."
4,"Sav Ravrin's review of ""Going Home""",This movie pretty much kicks some major behind. I recommend this movie to anyone who loves to make door knobs and ski. The movie was filmed not far from where i live and grew up. Sally Kirkland was incredible. This is one of my favorite movies.
3,The Role of the Historian,"Freya Stark is a wonderful writer and a delight to follow along her outrageous travels, but her scholarship holds too closely to her citings from a rich variety of sources, and while it proves she has done her homework it lacks conviction. It wanders. It digresses. It strays too far from her own natural gift for language, which would be put to better use in descriptions of her own. She could tie up all the ends and commit herself to the process, instead of leaning on ancient historians. She would like, herself, to be considered an historian, but she doens't really qualify: she wants it both ways and it doesn't work. Otherwise, I adored the book because it just happens to deal with a region I know and love, but I had to invest my own enthusiasm, and my own references, for weaving some sense into it."
3,An average book,"This book came free with my embroidery machine. The companion cd has some cute shapes that I plan to use, but the projects are pretty lame. I would not have bought the book given a choice. But since it is the only one of its kind that I have, I'm using it and am about to finish a quilt with a shape from the cd."
5,The right choice,It's the right choice for your Capresso coffee-maker. Ours is not an espresso machine. This is the right fit and it was so easy to find on Amazon.com!
3,Carbon Shortage?,"Maybe the global warming folks have it wrong, maybe there isn't a carbon shortage? Why else would these filters go up $6 in less than 3 years? Just a theory. ;-)"
2,Size matters,"I searched for the filters for my coffee maker by looking for the coffee maker and seeing what Amazon 'suggested' people buy with it...big mistake. The filters are the wrong size. There's probably nothing wrong with the filters, but since SIZE MATTERS, I can't tell you for sure. Happy searching!"
5,Make a huge difference in coffee taste quality,Received in timely manner and as described.If you've never owned a Capresso coffee maker with the additional filter option you don't know what you're missing. Hands down the best coffee maker I've ever owned.
3,To Filter or not to Filter; that is the question!,"This is my 3rd Capresso 454 Coffee maker. I love them! Great coffee, all the time.The filters that are used (1 comes with it) are about $5 each...3 for $15. What a giant ripoff!!First, I think charcoal filters are a good idea....but Jeez, $5 per filter?!! These things should sell for $.50 each! A total ripoff!My suggestion (after buying a 3 pack) is to use filtered water...or tap water. I don't think you will see a difference.This filter is specially shaped to go into the little basket, so other filters won't work. What a great idea...One could spend a fortune on filters alone!Use plain cold water....tastes the same!"
4,capress 4440.90 3 pack charcoal water filters,i like the capresso coffee maker and the filters are necessary for its use to have good coffee. they are easy to use and i would recommend them to anyone who owns the coffee maker.
1,Filters Don't Fit!! DON'T BUY THESE!,"These filters were suppose to fit my coffee maker according to the description, and they were way too big!! Very disappointed."
5,Capresso 4440.90 3-pack Charcoal Water Filter,"We usually use filtered water to make coffee but then since we bought Capresso machine with the charcoal water filters, we don't need to do that anymore. The filter lasts 60 uses or up to 6 weeks after first use."
4,Coffee maker water filter,These filters seem to work fairly well. I just wish they were less expensive. Ordering through Amazon always easy. They are very easy to change.
3,Another perspective,"We've used Capresso 440 for a few years. I agree with other reviewers that the cost-effective way around using their 4440.09 filter is to use filtered water.However, most of those reviewers overlooked a significant benefit of using a filter in the water tank - it keeps coffee grounds from entering then clogging the internal plumbing and/or heater. The Capresso 440 has an important design flaw, in that when making a full pot the brew can overflow back into the tank. Larger grind particles can (and have in our case) get into the internal plumbing and disrupt proper flow through the heater.We have been using a small wad of cheesecloth instead of the 4440.09 since our unit was repaired (probably replaced).Good luck"
4,"hey, it's a coffee filter","Man do I love my Capresso drip coffee maker. My Capresso needs filters. That's fine. I'd give it gold bullion if it asked...Since they are not made of gold, these filters get a 4 for price being a bit too high."
3,Barely Opened it.,"I had to buy this textbook for a freshmen year college Intro Chem course, and barely ever opened it. It was incredibly similar to the textbook used in my AP Chem class in the topics it covered and the depth.If you're taking an Intro Chem course, or any Chem course which uses this text, and you feel confident in your abilities with Chemistry, I would skip buying it. It's a good text, but you probably won't need it if you can already grasp the idea of enthalpy and dissociation constants.If you're not confident in your ability, or are new with Chemistry, or have a professor which relies heavily on textbooks, then you may want to purchase the text."
5,If You Love Orchestra Baobab . . .,"One of the best CDs to come out of Africa in recent years, this outstanding project risks being overlooked because it came out on an obscure if distinguished German label known to only a small group of African music aficiandos. There is one compelling reason to buy this CD - it will provide you with endless hours of pure pleasure. In fact, it will have you dancing around your home in joyful abandon. The four vocalists are all living legends in their native nations of Gambia and Senegal. Yahya Fall, the lead guitarist who also did the superb arrangements, is one of the true greats in world music today. The music comes out of the same Senegalese Afro-Cuban scene that produced Orchestra Baobab but the sound here is a bit tougher; more ""rootsy"" and less nostalgic. Take my word for it: this one is so hot it will melt your CD player and quickly become one of your favorite discs."
5,His sultry voice is completely intoxicating.,"Tyrese has the kind of voice that can make you feel every note. Ever since the Coca-Cola commercial, everyone has known that he was going to be a star. He's talented, smart, sexy and all around delicious. If I were a betting lady, I put all I had on him, but since I'm not a betting lady, I'll settle for being a sweet lady."
5,THIS SONG IS THE BOMD I ADVISE EVERYONE TO LISTEN !,THIS MUST BE THE SONG OF THE YEAR TYRESE IS BLOWING IT UP ON THE WHOLE ABLUM RECCOMEND THIS ABLUM TO ANYONE SO RUSH AND GET IT
5,it's all that and more,i think this is the hottest love song this year. when i hear this song it make me think of the love of my life my fisrt love. and about someone i like to get with.
4,"I HAVE ONE WORD TO SAY : ""BEAUTIFUL""","THERE IS THIS CERTAIN ""SOMEONE"" THAT I WOULD JUST LOVE TO HERE SING THIS SONG TO ME. IT WON'T BE ANYTHING LIKE TYRESE BUT STILL THOSE WORDS WOULD MEAN SOSOSOOO MUCH TO ME. I WOULD FOR SURE MELT."
1,Not for the PG-rated reader!,"Although I can see why this book holds such fascination for many adult American readers, those of us who would rather not be reminded of the depths of depravity of the human mind would not enjoy it at all. I bought this book as a gift for my deep-thinking teen-aged daughter, thinking it would be a novelty for her to read, but as I skimmed through it before wrapping it, I realized what a bad choice I had made. Though there are some funny and inspiring tidbits throughout it, much of it was crude and offensive. No, I didn't read the whole thing, but what I read was enough to turn me off completely...and sadden me that our society has stooped to this level. My only comfort is that many of the sick things I read were meant to be kept private in the first place. I just wish they had been."

3,Only Stata,"If you are looking for an applied logistic book that has the useful code and/or applied instructions (for anything other than STATA) keep looking. The writing in this book is solid and there is a nice appendix with STATA code but the book is of very limited value if you are trying to use R, SAS or SPSS to do analyses. If you want similar ideas but with SAS or SPSS help try O'Connell's extremely well written bookLogistic Regression Models for Ordinal Response Variables (Quantitative Applications in the Social Sciences)."
3,Non Fiction,"A look at a particular mathematical technique for investigating models with several outcomes. The author looks at both the logit and probit models, and briefly mentions others, and gives some detail and examples of logistic multinomial regression and other application sof this mathematical theory. Quite a useful little text."
1,an umglik,"This CD has no redeeming qualities. I sent it back for a refund one hour after I tried it out in my computer. If anybody knows of a Yiddish language course on DVD, please let me know. This isn't it."
1,FLIES IN THIS SOUP,"THERE IS GOOD SCHMUTZ AND BAD SCHMUTZ. THIS BOOK IS EITHER FICTIONAL, OR BAD SCHMUTZ. THERE ARE GLARING ERRORS TO BOOT. CONTRARY TO THE AUTHOR'S HUGE MISTAKE, THE WIDOW OF THE FAMOUS RESTAURATEUR HENRI SOULE WAS UNSUCCESSFUL IN ALL OF HER LAWSUITS TO GET PART OF HIS ESTATE. AND WHY WOULD THE AUTHOR INCESSANTLY REFER TO SOULE'S LIFE PARTNER, MRS SPALTER, AS HIS ""MISTRESS"", OVER AND OVER? THIS ELDERLY COUPLE SHARED THEIR LIFE AND WORK 24 HOURS A DAY EVERY YEAR. ONE REFERENCE WAS BAD ENOUGH, WHY HAMMER IT OVER AND OVER?AND THE WORD IS NOT ""MATERIZED"", IT IS ""MADERIZED"", THAT IS, WINE THAT IS OXIDIZED DUE HEAT AND TURNED CARMEL COLORED. EVERYONE WHO DRINKS OR READS ABOUT WINES KNOWS THAT.THE CONCENSUS OF ALL REVIEWS TO DATE ALL ECHO THE SAME BASIC SUMMARY, THIS IS SCHMUTZY WITHOUT BEING FUN."
4,"Sex, Food and maybe a little too much honesty","I think you'd have to be or have been involved in the food biz to enjoy this book as much as I did. The author is quite smart and sassy and knows the food industry better than almost anyone in America.That being said, the book is a little too ""insider"" oriented, not to mention a little too candid with regard to Ms. Greene's sex life - and I'm someone who loves a little sexy gossip.But if for foodies and food industry pros, it is a mouth watering page turner shedding an interesting light on the inner workings of the food business over the past couple of decades. If you can get past a few pages of that kind of TMI that makes you squirm in your chair, take the time to read this book. You won't regret it."
1,Totally libtard and amoral woman...disgusting reading,"Ms. Green lives a totally amoral life. She embellishes herself in it and is proud. Kind of like Satan himself. Yes, she knows about food, but while reading her book (which I actually burned in finding it so disgusting), she has whored herself into her position and is quite proud of it. I truly feel sorry for her and her inherent feeling that she is such an expert in any thing other than food. She truly embarasses me as a woman and it is probably good that she had no children who would remain tremendously embarassed to have her as a mother.The few recipes she provides are worthless and other than providing her some income, this book is totally trash, as is she."
1,You disgust me,"Greene should have titled this The Repugnant Personality. Vapid idolatrous reverence for celebrities, intensely self-disgracing sexual indiscretions and pretentious food gibberish all rolled into one person! If there's any truth to her sexual stories, it just goes to prove Simon Murray's point, ""some men will put their most prized possession where I wouldn't stick the ferule of my umbrella."""
2,This book will leave you slightly queezy,"Sometimes interesting, this name dropping study in self delusion and food left me feeling in need of a juice fast and a shower. It seems amazing the the author avoided a stroke, heart attack or AIDS. Usually books about food inspire me to cook something fabulous, this one did not."
1,"I thought we'd buried the 70's in a deep, deep hole","I'm younger than the author so my experience of the 70's was different. It was like passing through a time warp reading Greene's account of the decade. It was a bit of a wicked pleasure recalling the excesses of the time but ultimately Greene's memoir leads to satiety and revulsion and reminds me so clearly why the 70's has been called ""the nostalgia-proof decade.""For goodness sake: Your opening volley is sleeping with Elvis? Where can you go from there?Really self absorbed, ridiculous, superficial."
4,Hard to put down,"I enjoyed this light, gossipy book, although I don't have an extreme fondness for cooking. It was hard to put down at times. Gael does a ""tell all"" on herself."
4,"Book about food, sex and more...","As a restaurant critic Gael Greene has had a life full of delicious meals, interesting travels and exciting encounters with the opposite sex, and not only. Her memoir captures both her life and the paths of her career but also the history of food and how it's importance evolved throughout the years. The book however does not focus on food. The descriptions of different types of food and restaurants accompanied by some deliciously -looking recipes are very well balanced with the descriptions of sometimes quite saucy relationships of the author.I thought it was a fun and interesting memoir showing a slightly different approach to a lot of things... To summarize the book I would just say - very spicy!!! And I'm not only talking about the food here..."
2,Edit Me Please- An Excess of Ego,"Will I ever finnish this tedious tome? An excess of ego and pointless information. Ruth Reichel's exsquiste ""Comfort Me with Apples"" benefitted from a genius of editing, I longed for more. With Insatiable I want less. Ms. Greene sometimes writes about food as if it were ad copy.I had to laugh when she wonders after her second one night stand with Clint Eastwood ""I wondered if there could have been something more beyond the hotel room that night""....I would urge anyone interested in food writing and personalities worth spending time with to read all three of Ruth Reichel's memiors, any of MFK Fisher, and Amanda Hesser's ""Cooking for Mr. Latte"". A rewarding read awaits you."
1,Bad Appetites,"Whoa, this badly written, unsexy epic could have used some serious editing. I'm surprised, since I've enjoyed GG's witty reviews, but there's hardly an amusing line in this tome, which mostly chronicles Greene's narcissistic pursuit of celebs to wine, dine, and bed her. Talk about TMI! You'll come away from these pages feeling like you've eaten mediocre swill at an overrated restaurant; Greene evidently had all the depth of a finger bowl. I agree with others that Reichl's memoirs -- not to mention Fisher's and Child's -- are far, far better reads."
1,Bad,My expectations weren't high and it still didn't meet them. This is such a bad book on so many levels.
4,- touches a reality that most of us dont want to face -,"This book gets to a matter that is very seldom explored by the people reading it - their own deep dark insecurities. The sex scenes were very real and the whole book exudes the 70s. I find it to be one of my all time favorites. I suggest it to someone who has been searching in their life, or better yet - to the person who can face the truth of what they are looking for."
4,Compelling...,"This book was lent to me by a friend in March 2003 and I didn't get around to reading it until June 2003. I'm so glad I took time out to read this book. It was sad, compelling, smart, provacative and intriguing-all in one. I won't spoil the story for anyone but it's one of the top 50 books ever written."
3,FORMIDABLE,"A haunted, troubled discourse loaded with loveless sex and episodes of violence, and saturated with tangibility and keenness."
5,"Daring, Provocative, Enlightening","""Ohitika Woman"" is a true confession of a life most American Women have never lived. From Wounded Knee to Washington, from rags to riches, from love to heartbreak. Mary Brave Bird talks openly about her life as a proud Lakota woman, who defends the best interest of her people in the best ways she knows how. She talks honestly about life growing up on a poor Indian reservation, and proudly of her time with the American Indian Movement during the seige of Wonded Knee during the massive Red Movement of the 1970's. She is is a remarkably head-strong woman, and has lived her life this way even against incredible odds. What I enjoyed most was her enduring strength and the need to succeed and never give up. For this, she is a true winner, and a true success. A book for all Americans, ""Ohitika Woman"" has something to teach us all. As a Native Canadian, I greatly admire her overwhelming courage, strength and passion in fighting for what she believes in!"
1,Lame,"This was given to my 5 year old for christmas and it's very lame and not worth the plastic it's housed in. Screen is very hard to see for anyone that looked at it including myself, no options, and very un entertaining. My 5 year old who loves spiderman and math hates this thing and finds it so boaring.Get them something they will use."
4,Very comfortable & they loook good,"After placing my order for these shoues, they arrived very soon.They're comfortable (and ideal for me because I have diabetes; the velcro allows you to adjust the tightness of the shoes). Great traction on the bottom. Very nice looking. They appear to be well constructed and should last many years."
4,almost happy,"Love product. Quick service. Misled by color ""sport white."" Assumed it was WHITE, turned out to be TANISH color. Had to keep as needed immediately. Otherwise, mostly happy."
3,Propet,"I have owned Propet Walkers before and was willing to go the extra money to purchase another pair. They are good at support. My one disappointment was that they were listed as ""wides"" and they don't seem very wide at all. The tongue is thick and adds to the difficulty of getting the straps all they way across."
4,very comfortable,"The sneakers were very comfortable as soon as I put them on. I immediately went for a walk and they felt great. The velcro straps probably could be an eighth of an inch longer to allow for extra tightening, but the shoes looked smart and I received compliments. They seem to be well made and I would buy Propet sneakers again."
5,prophet women's walker,I really liked this shoe. I did not need to break it in. I used it for walking 4 miles and it was great. It is not heavy and feels very comfy.
5,Excellent service!,"The shoes were easy to find, were just what we needed, and even arrived a week earlier than had been promised!"
1,Poor Sizing,"Propets are good shoes & I have happily owned several, however this particular model# 3902 runs large. Advise you order a half size smaller than your regular size. My one star rating is not intended to reflect the quality of Propet shoes, only the sizing. Another review stated they come up too high near the ankle bone & that reviewer is correct, they do!"
5,Comfortable Easy To Adjust Walking Shoe,The shoe itself is comfortable for my long walks and the velcro allows me to make quick adjustments that prevent me from making the shoe too tight.
2,"Stiff, clunky shoes","I bought these shoes at regular price, in my regular size, at another website. When they arrived, they were clearly too small, either cut skimpily or missized. The Velcro tabs were so short they could barely be fastened. I couldn't even walk in them. I returned them and bought a similar shoe in another well known name brand, in my regular size/width. No problem.Later, when I saw these shoes marked down at Amazon.com, I ordered them again (the price was so low, how could I not?), this time a half size larger. STILL too small - a bit short for my big toe, a bit snug for the ball of my left foot, the Velcro straps still too short - and all very stiff, awkward, and clunky. At best, they would have needed stretching and some serious break-in time. A flexible, supportive shoe that runs true to size should not require that, IMO.So - I have learned my lesson and would not buy these shoes again in any size, anywhere."
4,sneakers,"I read all the reviews on Amazon's website about these sneakers and I looked forward to receiving them. Based on the similar shoes I've had for some time I ordered the same size I've been wearing. However, these shoes are a little narrower across the toe and they squeezed a little, so back they went! I would rather have been able to just exchange than to refund and reorder, but I guess Amazon has some reason for that policy. I'll try again with a half size larger, I guess, although I haven't reordered yet."
3,tour walker,"Compared to a pair of shos I already owned, these were not as wide as advertised. I had to return them."
5,Great Shoes,"I love these shoes. This is my third pair. Each time I order them, they fit great and provide excellent support."
3,This is not a EEEE,Recently had to have a brace for my foot. Needed a 4EEEE. Ordered this shoe in a 4EEEE but this shoe is doing good to be a 1E. Kept them to wear the one on the good foot and bought another pair from Payless shoes that were half the price.
1,Not wide enough - had to give them away,This sneaker was a big disappointment. Ordered wide and they hurt. Went out and bought a pair of SAS sneakers in the same size and they fit great. I gave these sneakers away to someone who does not wear wide size and they fit -- so the sizing is a big lie.
5,1 of the best at any price.,"This is a quality lightweight shoe. I think you'd have a hard time finding a shoe of this type, as well made, at any price range. Very comfortable, very stylish."
3,Pretty good,"When I got the toy, I was so excited. This had been the only thing I had thought about for like 2 weeks. Once I actually ordered it, it came perfect. Although the glow-in-the-dark darts are kinda junky. All and all a pretty good toy."
5,Tales of the Cthulhu Mythos,"This is the BEST book i have EVER read! If you love sci-fi/horror books, you'll LOVE it. When i read this book i couldn't put it down! THIS IS A MUST READ FOR EVERYONE!"
5,Very good tire gauge,"Unlike other tire gauges, this one allows me to get the tire pressure very easily. It saves me lot of time to get the tire pressure. I'm very satisfied with this tire gauge. I don't hesitate to recommend it to you."
4,Pretty Good,"This air gauge is pretty good. Much more accurate than the gauge on my compressor. I'll overfill and then use the Milton air gauge to dial it back down. Sometimes it is hard to get the gauge to reset to zero. If it wasn't for that mechanical issue, I'd rate it five stars. It is a PITA to be fiddling with this thing when its 10*F and windy and you're trying to get the tires filled right."
5,MY GOOD FRIEND ROY ROGERS,"When i was growing up, i loved all of roy's movies, i could not get Enough of them. This movie, my pal trigger stuck to me like glue. except the name i forgot,I just could not remember it. So just before Roy left us he sold a lot of his horse's and i went there and met him for the first time. He was tired and came over where i was sitting down. We had a long talk, and i loved it. That was when i ask him about the movie,when he first got trigger,He said he liked all of his movies, but that was a special one of His. He said that one stands out for him too."
2,Annoying,"This movie was frustrating to watch because some of the main characters, including the local law enforcement, lacked intelligence and reason. Besides having an annoying plot, the film needed restoration. The sound quality was poor and the nighttime scenes were difficult to make out.Horse lovers may enjoy the many horse scenes.A better western: Riders in the Sky"
5,ROY & TRIGGER,THIS WAS PURCHASED AS A GIFT FOR A FRIEND WHO IS A ROY ROGERS FAN. SHE JUST RAVED ABOUT THE MOVIE AND HOW MUCH IT BROUGHT HER BACK TO HER CHILDHOOD.
5,My Pal Trigger,Surprisingly moving drama for a Roy Rogers B Western. Recommended in an Associated Press news article by Quentin Tarantino of all people.My Pal Trigger
3,Love old cowboy movies,Enjoyed watching when i was a kid and still enjoy as a big kid! Buy it youll like it! So will the grandkids.
2,Amphibigear Rain Jacket,"There really isn't much to this 'jacket'. If you want to stay warm in a chilly rain, you will need to wear something heavy underneath it. As they say, 'You get what you pay for'. I believe the 'low' price was a bit high for what I actually got. I will not buy anything like this ever again!"
1,fooled by omission,this should have been sold as disposable clothing for emergency use only.worn twice.felt stupid putting it on because of its appearance.second time it looked dowdy and fabric did not breathe at all.the fabric is used in enviro shopping bags and $2 labcoats.i purchased a nike on ebay for same money. it is real clothing not costume.
3,Shelley was Pretty!,"This two album Cd compilation is a very good sampling of Shelley Fabares (pronounced Fab-ray)and her attempt at singing. Her ""Johnny Angel"" was a number one smash in the summer of 1962. These songs were recorded when Shelley played (Mary Stone),Donna Reed's daughter on ABC-TV's Donna Reed Show 1960-1965. Shelley says in the liner notes ""I couldn't sing, but the people at COLUMBIA Pictures and COLPIX Records insisted that I make an album."" It was said that in the making of ""Johnny Angel"" Shelley recorded the song over 30 times and parts from every one of those 30 takes is used in the final product. But hearing Shelley sing is delightful. Anyone who remembers the early 60's will want to have this CD, simply because it's the homogenized way things were then and it brings back some great memories. By the way, you'll notice that Shelley is backed by some very good musicans and singers. If you are a Shelley Fabares fan, this will be a great CD for you."
2,Inferior collection of Shelley Fabares songs,"I can't find any reason to choose this cd. The cd contains a few of good Fabares songs, but most just are tasteless and superfluous covers of hits like Locomotion, Roses are Red, See you in September.Anybody who wants the real good music Fabares has made should go out and get the cd ""Best of Shelley Fabares"". It just contains her best original songs."
4,Great memories,"I always loved Shelly ever since she was on The Donna Reed Show, and was 10 years old when she sung Johnny Angel. The sound of her voice brings back lots of fond memories, which is why I purchased this CD.I also remember ""Where's It Gonna Get Me"" which was played a lot on the radio and was a fairly big hit for her, as well.I know she's not Adele, but her voice is good and very sweet.However, I do think the first album (""Shelly"")of this CD is the best - ""Things We Did Last Summer"" has a bad sound....sort of muffled, and to me, doesn't even sound like her.I would recommend this CD if only for the first several songs."
4,Shelley! / Things We Did Last Summer,"The of plate very good content,quality of good with purchase this product be satisfied and I command with different."
2,"Great Nostalgia, Good quality CD copy, poor singer","After having a crush on this gorgeous woman for now over 50 years, I thought I'd get one of her CDs. I never saw throughher beauty before to see how bad of a singer she really was. Fortunately, the background singers and music on most of her songs drownout her voice enough to where the music is actually decent to listen to.Buy this CD only for it's nostalgic value, not for it's entertainment value.The CD itself is not a normally manufactured CD. It clearly is a copy, with what appears to be an inkjet printed label. The tone quality and stereo separation is excellent however."
5,"Incredible, moving music","This music is some of the most tender and hauntingly beautiful I have ever heard. Only recently was I introduced to this treasure on the Home Shopping Network. I had fallen asleep on the couch, and awoke to the sounds of Esteban. I found myself absolutely taken away by the music. My wife gave me this cd and a live Esteban video for my birthday, and I am a fan for life!As a guitartist I am in awe of his incredible skill, but more so by the spirit and feeling with which he plays. Esteban's blend of flamenco, classical, jazz and other elements absolutely captivates. The music actually has a deeply spiritual feel.Esteban takes time-honored classics and crafts them with his fingernails against nylon strings like you've never heard them before. Try ""Never My Love"", ""Fernando"", ""Don't Cry For Me Argentina""...or my personal favorite...""Unchained Melody""Listen to it with someone you love, or while thinking about someone you love."
5,greeneyes,A very beautiful and relaxing CD of some of Esteban's best. I love guitar music and am very pleased with this.
5,Very relaxing,"I bought this CD for my baby to listen to in the car, it's very relaxing for her and us."
3,lot of dups,"The sound is great and the selections are good, just too many duplicates with other CD's of Esteban. But if this is your first or only CD of this artist then I would rate it 5 stars"
5,THIS WAS ONE OF THE GREATEST BOOKS I HAVE EVER READ!,"'The Reclamation Project' is quite possibly one of the most fascinating and intriguing books I have ever read! Ms. Davis writes a spellbinding tale that expertly weaves fact, fiction and biblical prophecy into a masterful literary creation. The characters are exceptionally well employed and uniquely described, affording a realism not often seen in the science fiction novels of today...I highly recommend this absolute work of art to anyone who enjoys truly good science fiction!"
5,This is good stuff.,"Ardery's account of his life as a B-24 pilot is excellent. From all the training it took to simply get into the planes, to combat in the skies over the Mediterranean and Northern Europe, Ardery's account is an even-handed account of what a bomber pilot's life was like.The chapter about Ploesti is especially fascinating. James Dugan and Carrol Stewart used Ardery as a source for their book on the subject, and the details of Ardery's part in the raid offer some really interesting stuff. Especially intruiging is the background and fate of Medal of Honor winner Lloyd Hughes, who was flying on Ardery's wing when when he perished.This book is really good stuff; Steven Ambrose's ""Wild Blue"" pales in comparison. Ardery doesn't place himself on a hero pedestal, he merely tells of his experiences in a very interesting and easy-to-digest style."
4,Good value,"Cheap and functional. Looks like a binder with plastic covers. Good for general use, but not durable enough to travel. If you want a more durable CD holder, get one with zipper and hard covers."
5,love these,"These are absolutely beautiful. I love that they hold more than one size candle. They have a stunning sparkle to them and the price is excellent, get some as a gift but be sure to get a set for yourself!"
5,Love it- adults and kids!,"This is a fun game for all ages. When we have adult game night, we love it because you have to think...but just a little. And for kids (probably 7 and above) they can learn how to add several numbers in a row to get to a certain point. easy to learn, fast to play....it's a blast!"
5,This book is underrated by literary scholars.,"The wisdom of literary scholars should be ignored as most of them dismiss this book. Personally, The Brothers Karamazov has been my least favorite of Dostoevsky's novels, and I have now read ten Dostoevsky novels. This book is excellent, though less explicitly philosophical and psychological as The Brothers Karamazov, which is clearly why literary scholars don't hold this book in as high esteem. However, this book is a better piece of ART. I have said it: I like The Adolescent more than The Brothers Karamazov."
4,"Been a while, but it's a good book.","Forgive me, it's been a while since I read this book, but I figured I'd review it.I really liked it. I mean I -really- liked it. I thought it got a bit heavy on philosophy I didn't quite understand. But then again, I was also an adolescent. I rather understood what he felt, being a bastard child myself, and now that life has taken an equally odd turn, I think it would probably behoove me to re-read it.But back to the point, I think the plot is excellent, though very thin. It pretty much focuses on letters and a supposed love-affair that occurred out of the country, where no one was watching.The only real let-down was the ending. It was very strange and seemed completely disconnected from the rest of the novel, as if he were in a rush to close it off and start on something else.As with many books, however, the enjoyment is the trip, not the destination. I think that definitely holds true for this book."
5,"Good Stuff Here, Folks","I've listened to this collection of tunes maybe hundreds of times now. The playing is, of course, first rate--and it's obvious they had a marvelous time recording--but it's the tunes themselves, especially the originals, that are the real stars here. These are new tunes worth learning and playing (or even just whistling on a walk.)"
4,"Good, fun music","Author ofThe Complete Idiot's Guide to Playing the Fiddle (Complete Idiot's Guide to)While some of my traditional music friends weren't so impressed with this recording, I have to say I love it. The music is happy, and the tunes are groovin' and uplifting. That said, if you are looking to really hear more of the technical genius of Frankie Gavin's fiddling or Sharon Shannon's accordian playing, etc, you should try one of their solo projects.The sound of ""Tunes"" is definitely an ensemble endeavor- though an enjoyable one that will get your feet tapping."
4,Great pulp story,"Just an enoyable, great pulp story from one of the lesser known, most prolific pulp masters of the golden era, Arthur D. Howden-Smith. ""Grey Maiden"" tells the tale of a fabled sword - like Excalibur or Tizona del Cid - which passes from hand to hand through different historical ages (kind of the same idea as used in the Western ""Winchester 73"")."
3,Not for my 5 year old.,The instructions aren't clear. I've had a hard time with it. I introduced it to my 5 year old. It sit on a shelf untouched. Hopefully in a few months she'll work with it again. I think it's for an older 6 year old.
5,Wonderful of my little craft daughter!,"My daughter was exposed to looming from preschool. She is now in first grade, the year she received it , and she couldn't put it down!"
2,Too Difficult,"The loom is a bare-bones loom, and the instructions are difficult even for an adult to understand. My daughter weaved about 8 lines with my help and just lost interest as you constantly need to rethread new yarn because it comes in strands rather than a continuous loop. Waste of money."
2,Has Potential-Is Uniden Listening?,"Short and sweet,Liked the 5.8 true digital signal to and from the handset.Liked the possibility of expandability.Liked the speakerphone.Didn't like how the letters imprinted on the face of the phone and answering unit began to wipe off within 5 months of use.Didn't like how it will continuously beep after a message has been received without an option to disable the beep-very annoying when trying to nap!Didn't like how the don't disturb mode doesn't turn ALL sounds off, in one sweep. The answer machine still can be heard as well as the base ringer. It'd be nice to have all sounds shutoff for naptime with my infant!Didn't like how the customer service wasn't available and didn't return my message when I was prompted to leave a message.I only purchased this phone after reading many favorable reviews (I forget where).I don't recommend this phone to anyone except as a giveaway to someone who can't afford a phone."
2,not as good as yoga toes,my wife bought a pair of yoga toes. I bought these toe-stretchers. the material is rigid and unpleasant to the touch. the yoga toes that my wife purchased are more pliable and comfortable.
4,Simply Beautiful,"As a newlywed, I have purchased several books to enhance my cooking skills recently. This book stood out because of the beautiful presentation of each item and promise of simplicity. Although I did have to call my mother-in-law aobut how to tie up a chicken (not explained) this book has turned some excellent entrees for myself and my husband. One complaint, the book is so large it is difficult to keep nearby while cooking without getting in the way or accidently becoming part of the cooking process. Overall it is a book that has taught me a lot about beautiful presentaion of simple dishes and is beautiful too look at."
5,"Delicious Recipes, Great Photographs and Detailed Descriptions","This is a true must have. This is an elegant and beautifully crafted book, that contains best simple recipes from the Chuck Williams Collection: Simple Italian Cooking, Simple French Cooking, and Simple American Cooking.The book includes nearly 200 recipes, beautifully formatted and at a great price. I say it again, a truly must have."
1,"Looks fun, but doesn't work","What a disappointment -- and a rather pricey mistake. The idea looks good on paper, but this toy was difficult to assemble (small hands couldn't push the pieces together) and the antenna was almost immediately broken by our 4-yr-old. Once my husband (an engineer) finally put it together, the gears kept binding up and it wouldn't go. I'm going to ask the manufacturer to issue a refund or credit towards one of their other products which has been kid-tested and less of a chore."
1,"Difficult toy, poorly made","We just bought this product (through another source) for our 4-year old. First of all, this is much too involved and complicated for a 4-year old to follow. Second, he broke it immediately. The tabs that the gears connect to are not very strong; this has made the motorized based unusable. The gear idea is cute, but I will stick to legos and tinker toys in the future."
1,"Looks cool but is very, very poorly made",1. Parts fit together so poorly it is doubtful most children could connect most of them. I bloodied my knuckle while trying to fit two pieces together and had to make many connections by pressing connected parts into the floor.2. Motor could not handle a vehicle--built directly from intructions--with many gears. I simplified the machine by removing about half the gears and the motor only worked at that point with some difficulty (with fresh batteries).3. Remote control and motor do not allow turning; vehicles constructed can only move forward and in reverse.
1,Just not worth it!,"Piece are hard to put together and harder to get apart. 4yo lost interest VERY quickly. Doesn't move properly in certain arrangements so you send even more time taking it apart and putting it together another way. Cute idea but, probably not worth the expense."
4,great idea but....,"My kids got this set a few years ago and the antena on the motor part got broken....so it went to the back of the closet. My mom ordered a new set for my son's 8th birthday and we had it for a day before my 6 year old son broke the antena on the motor again. We found that a new motor and remote was sold on learning resources website for 4.99 so we ordered 2 (one for each set.) When we got them one got broken right away. I highly recommmend this toy, but for older children or children who aren't so hard on their toys (are there any like this? lol) Also the peices are kind of hard for small fingers to take apart.... if those things could be fixed it would be a great toy."
2,"Interesting toy, but asssembly is difficult and quality is poor","Bought this toy with a lot of anticipation.Product turns out to be very difficult to assemble even for adults.Quality of parts are poor..if the axles break when dropped (which happens a lot by a toddler), they are rendered useless..especially modules.But when its working, my son and me had a great time.Learning resources should put in a little bit of effort in improving the quality of the product."
3,Caution when removing remote pieces from packaging,My kids were so excited to play with this toy that they couldn't wait for mom and dad to help them remove the parts. They broke the main gear box with the extendable remote for the car. The remote piece snapped off and it is impossible to glue back together because it is on a wheel. I would definately wait until your kids are at least 6 or 7 before purchasing this. Without the main part of the toy this car won't work.
5,two words (buy this),this cd is the best they have done since metal health. the new songs are well written rock classics. and the remakes of the classics are terrific. this is thier comeback cd. i cant wait until the next one
5,"THIS CD IS AWSOME, WHEN IS THE NEXT ONE COMMING OUT","Big Quiet Riot fan, have been waiting for this one. It starts out with some fresh new rock, then goes into some great remixes of some of the old stuff. Seen QR in Detroit on july 5, and got to meet the band after the show, What a way to finish off the night. If you get a chance to see these guys, get your tickets."
3,The Return of Quiet Riot,"have you noticed a lot of the old metal acts coming out lately? Quiet Riot makes it's return with their latest release ""alive and well"". although a good album overall, it has the same commercial feel that their earlier albums had. i have to hand it to them though, they're still churning out those hooky rock anthems (check out the first track), and they keep it simple (simple is a good thing). unless you are a die hard fan, i would consider buying their new release. Noel Lorusso"
3,Where is Cavazo's Guitar?,"I was a big QR fan after Metal Health came out, but dropped off after I bought Condition Critical which has horrible lyrics written by second graders. On Alive and Well the musicianship is great, but I think the lyrics were written by the same second graders that wrote Condition Critical. My other complaint on this album is that they must have been fighting with Carlos Cavazo when they re-recorded the songs at the end of the album because it is all drums and bass with the guitars way in the back where you can barely here them. With all that said, the song Alive and Well is one of their best ever."
2,"Excellent Idea, poorly done!","I was going to plan a gambling excursion around the world and bought this book as a reference guide. I was very excited when it came, it listed more casinos than I ever dreamed existed. As I got to reading it, I have never seen more typos in my life: wrong phone numbers, misspellings, and it continues. I am disgusted with it.I tried to contact the publisher on the web for a refund, and found their site is down. I would not be surprised if it is a sign of things to come for the company.Very hard to read: even just for reference. Look elsewhere!"
1,Unsafe for Pets - FDA Inspection Failure!,"FDA inspection Failed so the manufacturer was forced to stop production. It's not safe to feed to your pets. I ordered the same thing, just different shape - soft chews instead - but was only informed after the sale why it was discontinued."
3,ok,i didn't like judy blumes book superfudge i have however read other books of her and thought they were fantastic! i didn't think that judy blume lived up to her standard i thoguth that it was a good book i just thought that it could have beeen beter i still think that judy blume is a great writter i just didn't like this book as much as her others
2,Good and bad,I like the book but if a young child reads this and finds out that Santa is not real what will they do
4,For my son,"My youngest loves to read. In school as a class they read the fourth grade nothing. Accidentally, I was suppose to get the fourth grade nothing and clicked on super fudge. Even though, he loved it and had read about 6 chapters in one sitting. He's almost completed the whole collection of big Nate collection. He received the issue gone for broke and read the whole book in less than three weeks."
4,Super Fudge for older children,My second grader and I read Tales of a Forth Grade Nothing together and loved it. I assumed Super Fudge would be about the same. After starting the book I found some of the subject matter to be for older children. It was cute and funny but not for younger children.
4,Good for a Laugh,"I liked Super Fudge by Judy Blume. It's about a boy named Peter and his annoying little brother Fudge. When they move to New Jersey, Fudge starts annoying Peter more. Just when you think Peter had it his mom is having a baby. It's really funny and you can always get a good laugh out of it.by Keizo"
4,"Fudge is Back, and so is Peter","Judy Blume books are sure to please every time. I remember Superfudge from elementary school, and I have to say it was just as fun to reread as an adult. Peter has the unenviable task of being the oldest sibling to a precocious Fudge. Understandably he's not excited to learn yet another new sibling is on the way. I think he handles himself pretty well for his age, and Fudge is a riot. Just the idea that Fudge now has to see himself as an older sibling, just as Peter did when Fudge was born, was an interesting development. The parents fit their era, and Blume has provided a family drama most of us can relate to - children living with the decisions of their parents, and expected to be happy about it."
5,Good for all ages,"Superfudge is one of those books that is good for all ages. It instantly connects with your childhood id, reminding you of the events that shaped who you are today. If anything you can relax, knowing you weren't alone. Whether you grew up as Peter, grew up as Fudge, or grew up as something in between, Judy Blume understood your story. Could you ask for any more than that?"
1,Horrible,"This book was HORRIBBLE!!! I hated it so much that i slapped myself accross the face after reading it. Now I know to never ever ever ever ever ever ever, ever times a million, read another Judy Blume Book."
5,Superfudge- one the funniest books by Judy Blume,I bought the kindle edition of Superfudge for my niece and she loved the book. I give Superfudge five stars because my 2 adult children who are now in undergrad and graduate school always laughed when they read the book. That was years ago when they were in elementary school.
3,"Well written, but not as good as Fourth Grade Nothing","At age 9 I enjoyed this book but didn't like it as much asTales Of A Fourth Grade Nothing. For one thing, there were no pictureslike the previous book. Another thing, I felt like the Fudge series lost some of it's innocense with one of Peter's friends saying blankety-blank (they didn't actually print it out but hinted it) in front of Fudge and his pals. Peter's pal should have known better. I wouldn't recommend this book to really young readers for that reason, and it may be upsetting for some kids because of the fact that Blume gives the impression that there's no Santa. Now when I read it, I wasn't upset because I already knew. But I think it'd upset some children, and I thought it was sad that Fudge lost his childlike innocense by not believing in Santa anymore. So parents, I highly advise you to proof-read this book before handing it over to your kids, as with any questionable material."
2,WARNING! Do NOT allow kids who love Santa read this book!,"We love Judy Blume's books so far but, my God, what was this woman thinking? She writes a book that features an 11 year old but is read, let's face it, by 7-10 year olds. Many of these children cherish Santa Claus and this book basically kills it for them. I cannot believe that I unwittingly bought my young son a book, second in the series he loves, and had to face his tearful face asking me if it is true. This is an area that should be left to parents and children to discuss and decide for themselves. For shame, Judy Blume!"
2,Jacob is on my soccer team and he is realy good,"It was an ok book I really liked when Fudge got the talking bird. Judy Blume is the best author, But I still thougt it could have been better, and I have read a lot of better books."
1,Ruins Christmas,My kid's and I listened to this book on CD during our morning drive to school. I was shocked and disapointed that the author plainly tells children there is no Santa Clause (she's wrong of course). I found it reprehensible that she would take this position in a children's book.
5,Another great book by Judy Blume!,"This book would make a great gift for an older child. ""Superfudge"" is the sequel to ""Tales of a Fourth Grade Nothing,"" another classic children's story. Twelve-year-old Peter Hatcher and his family are moving to Princeton for a year. Peter and his brother Fudge don't always get along. Their mother is going to have a baby soon, adding more uncertainty to their lives. Will the baby be like Fudge? What could be worse for Peter?Kids, especially with younger brothers and sisters will relate to the problems Peter faces. The story moves quickly, keeping the reader's attention, and is filled with humor. The reader will definitely appreciate Blume's talent for writing a good tale.As a children's book author, I highly recommend ""Superfudge.""Richard W. Carlson Jr., author of ""Jeremy Grabowski's Crazy Summer in Stormville!"""
3,#13 jasmine,"There is a boy named Peter.Peter has a brother named Farily but they call him Fudge.Peter gets mad at his parents because, his mom is having a new baby.The babys name is tootie.Later in the story they move to Princeton because, mom wants to take a Art history class. Peter and his brother meets new friends like for instance Peter meets a boy named Alex and Fudge meets a kid named David. I realy suggest you read this book it is very funny.Do not only read SuperFudge read the other books of Judy Blume."
4,Fantastic!,"Superfudge is a great, funny and adventurous book. Peter is a twelve-year-old boy with a four-year-old brother named Fudge. Fudge is certain that he will grow up to be a bird; as far as Peter is concerned Fudge will grow up to be a big annoyance! This book is filled with fun adventures and great jokes. I strongly recommend that 8-10 year old kids read and enjoy it!By Stella"
4,Great book but be careful,"I have probably read this book a dozen times -- the first time being in second grade when I was shocked to discover that Santa did not exist. I was so ashamed about reading this that I continued to lead my parents on and pretended to believe for two more years.I think that the story itself is excellent and touching -- probably one of Judy Blume's best. But now that I am older, and will have children of my own shortly -- I will not let them read it until I know they do not believe in Santa anymore. It's truly devastating to find out the truth in a book available in the primamry section of the school library!!Perhaps it could be considered to publish a version without the no Santa Claus chapter???"
5,Even children's books should be reviewed by parents first.,"While I love this story, I feel I must address the area of the book where Santa no longer exists for Fudge. Yes, it's a shock, but things like this happen in real life, and I commend Judy Blume for tackling it. For those that either gave a believing child a copy, or had the myth dashed on audiotape- I want to ask why wasn't the material reviewed? You wouldn't let your kids watch a movie unless you had screened it, would you? I find it highly suspect that people today expect everyone else to police things for them. Would you feed your kids a meal where you knew nothing about the ingredients? Would you let your kids play with others you didn't know? If so, I think the bigger issue isn't the book."
4,Santa Spoiler Warning for tiny ears!!!!!!!!,"Don't get me wrong, I am a huuuuuuuuuge fan of Judy Blume and have read many of her books. However, we have this book on tape and having not read THIS one, didn't know that on side 2 of tape 2, chapter 10 entitled ""Santa who?"" is a Santa spoiler. We love books on tape/cd for the car and listen to them all the time.This is only a spoiler warning for parents who have kids who have not yet gotten to that point. It's perfectly fine, don't have a problem with it per se, just be careful if there are tender ears who still have a few Christmases left in the magical world where Santa is real.TAPE 2, SIDE 2, CHAPTER 10 ""SANTA WHO?"""
2,From a Parent: Not Recommended,"I read this book together with my 7-year old and we were both very dissapointed. He found a couple gags funny (like a myna bird that says, ""Bonjour, Stupid"")but the book goes nowhere and sucker-punches on Santa and Divorce. If your child still believes, stay away!"
1,Love the book but hated the Santa chapter,"As some other readers have commented - one has to beware of reading this to a 5 year old, or in the case of my daughter, an 8 year old. Thank God I didn't let her read it and was able to 'edit' that Chapter quite severely to protect the two of them. What a surprise to take a full frontal assault on Santa in such an otherwise incredible series. I didn't get the joke I guess. Destroying a young child's fantasy life is hardly appropriate material. I see the age recommendation is 9 and up, but still, that's an awfully young age to expose adult viewpoints on Christmas in my view. At least in this context it was."
1,Selected Poems and Two Plays of William Butler Yeats,Good condition but way too much writing all over the book. Hard to actually read the poetry.
1,Terrible,"Ok, yes, this book does describe certain Native American practices. But, about a million other books written by *actual* Native Americans do the same thing. I could not get through this book. This woman is so full of herself it's sickening. She touts her ordination from the ULC like it's some big accomplishment, when anyone who can type their name and go on the ULC's website gets ordained! This woman is a joke. It's new age hooey mixed with some stolen practices.If you are interested in Native Americans, you might as well read, ""Lame Deer, Seeker of Visions"" by John Lame Deer, along with ""Gift of Power"" by Archie Lame Deer (Lakota). ""Black Elk Speaks"" is also good. Also, there is ""Mother Earth Spirituality"" by Ed McGaa that talks about Lakota religion, and, if you just want to know about ceremonies without all the pompus crap in this book, try, ""American Indian Ceremonies"" by Medicine Hawk and Grey Cat, which focuses more on Cherokee practices."
1,blah blah blah blah,"This woman says she isnt an anthropologist,but she talks like one.Sheapproaches the spirit path like a scientist.She claims to be a ""medicinewoman"" but doesnt show it.Native American Medicine people dont write books.She illumined no onein this book,just gave generalizations that were self evident.She still calls herself a ""medicine woman"" giving ""psychic"" readingsonline.I found this book sadly lacking in real Native understanding.Shefalls very short of what it means to be an integrated soul.I am a sundancer,a pipe carrier,and have spent alot of time withseveral REAL medicine people.She spouts pure drivel."
1,Not what you'd expect,"This is not a live coverage of the 9/11 terrorist attack as it happened, but a CBS special show later that night. You get a brief glimpse of the event, followed by a lot of bureaucrats talking live in a press conference. Period.For the actual breaking news bulletins of that fateful day, link to YouTube. No DVD has them."
5,***Freedom under attack***,"The shock and awe of September 11, 2001 marked the beginning of an unprecedented assault on our liberty."
1,Showed up broken,"Mine showed up with a broken mechanical piece that probably holds the whole spring system together. I wrote to them but expect it is more expesive then the unit is worth to ship it back for repair or replacement. It looks ok if it would work, but is completely useless to me. They have written me with instructions to repair it myself and I will try and let you know if it works when I have the time."
1,Rather Useless Scale,"I purchased this in a moment of hopefulness--it seemed ideal. The design looked unobtrusive (glass) and a little interesting. The reality is, it is 5-10 pounds off, hard to read, easy to step on and bump into (glass), and is now taking up space in the closet and should be in the garbage!"
1,Yuk!,"This is by far the nastiest thing I have ever put in my mouth...My husband who will eat anything and I mean anything, even if he doesn't like it just so food doesn't go to waste, could not even stomach this. He told me to take it out of the fridge and just dump out the entire bottle."
1,I tried it because of the ratings,I tried this sauce with high hopes because so many people raved about it. All I can say is....YUCK! It tastes like ketchup with cinnamon. I was very disappointed and will never purchase this product again.
3,Tolerable,I thought it would have the samebtastevas the leading barbecue sauce. It is an acquired taste. You may have a different opinion.
1,yuck!,"This sauce is gross! I bought it knowing that it was a ""diet"" food, but didn't expect it to be that bad. It didn't taste anything like BBQ sauce. I can't even describe how awful it tasted or what it tastes like. Luckily I bought it at a local store, and didn't pay the higher rate on here or shipping."
1,Chemical aftertaste,"Give Walden Farms credit for making a no-carb sauce. It's just a shame it doesn't taste better. Still, I do buy it on occasion and mix it with other tastier sauces to lower the over all carb content. However, the smoke taste is so overwhelming that more than a proportion of 1:4 leaves only the taste of this product in your mouth. This product cannot begin to compare with the taste of the now-defunct Kraft's low-carb barbecue sauce. Mostly, I make my own low-carb sauce from scratch and then just add a bit of this to get the smoke taste, but too much and even the best batch of homemade sauce is ruined. However, if you are on an extreme low-carb diet (such as Dr. Bernstein's) this may be the only product that fits."
4,Helps with the HCG diet !,"There is only so much grilled chicken with spices you can endure before you start losing your mind and your will to keep dieting. This sauce suprised me on its flavor. It was nice and smokey and sweet. It is thin, but, do you want that many chemicals in your food to make it thick? Great change of pace!"
2,Chemical taste,"At first I thought it tasted ok. But after a few bites, it began to taste chemically. My husband doesn't like it either."
5,: ),"i've watched this at least 5 times now. i'm still amazed by it.if you feel the same, do whatever it takes to see ""the vertical ray of the sun"" by tran ahn hung."
3,NEEDS A LITTLE SEASONING AND SOY SAUCE....,"The characters are fine, the script's okay but the movie has no flavor or no personality. They should've made the plot more interesting and simplified it a little bit. Not everybody can pick up on storylines like this one. It's about one girl who's trying to secretly set her male friend up with her sister, her sister's real name is charolette but she introduce herself as darcy , and later on the sister wants darcy to come clean and tell him the truth but charolette is kind of reluctant. Theres more to the movie though, I Just felt that the screen writer or th director could have done a better job by making this movie a little bit more interesting. How ever I did like the music by cody."
4,eugenia and jacqueline anytime,very good film . all actors are good. eugenia yuan and jacqueline kim are a pleasure to view and play their parts well. very good ending. highly recommended.
1,negative stars if i could,"i agree with the reviewers giving this movie 1 star. this is absolutely the worse most horrible movie. in hollywood, the white guy is portrayed as the hero and the asian is protrayed as some wife-beating person. so everyone is waiting for change. this movie protrays the asian guy as some innocent person who prefers love over sex and the asian girl as some slut. yeah great retarded protrayal. I think all these people especially the writer should be permanently banned from the film business. for once, write a film that is actually about asian people and don't try to make the guy an all innocent retard and the girl the bad guy. asian people is like all people white, black, yellow, green. sheesh. being asian, i rather watch a hollywood film, wife-beating asian is better than this crap."
5,Beautiful,"This movie is totally beautiful both emotionally and photgraphically. I am so happy I got a copy and saw it. It reminds me of my time in Los Angeles.... I would see any other movie that the director, photographer and actors were involved in."
4,Alot of laughs,This is a pretty funny story and has some great actors in it. Although it could be considered a little on the odd side it definitely will get you laughing. There's always something going wrong and the comedy never stops!
4,Some adult viewing appeal,"MEN AT WORK has some adult viewing appeal. It begins with a plausible plot, some well-timed humor, and sharp lines of dialogue. Where did it go wrong? At a point when the writers decided to make idiots out of two patrolmen, it would seem. From that point the movie became a formula effort--the meaningless effort to hide a corpse, the ridiculous kidnapping of a pizza deliveryman, the absurd hitmen who can't hit--oh yes, the car chases. The humor became simply juvenile. In spite of its'shortcomings, the movie was entertaining. Sheen and Estevez are fun to watch. There are some adult gags mixed in with the junior high school bathroom humor. I'd watch this again, but not if a Woody Allen flic were handy."
1,ILL ADVISED ON 'REGION',I really like the movie so i wasnt to thrilled when i received it and found out i cant play it in the usa....
1,DVD that don't play,DVD would not play in PS3 or DVD player. Don't buy the DVD. I just threw it away because it wouldnt be worth the time to return it.
1,DIDNT WORK,This DVD did not work on any of the DVD players in our home. This was very disappointing asit was a gift to my son. He use to love this movie. Its' aggravating to have to send this back.What a hassle!
1,HELP'S TP RECEIVE PROPER REGION DVD..! (REGION 2 RECEIVED)<<??,"THIS IS JUST PLAIN COMMON SENSE I'D SAY. I LIVE IN THE U.S., I SPEAK ENGLISH, YOU'D THINK THE SELLER WOULD REALIZE THIS AND SEND A DVD IN REGION 1 SO IT WOULD WORK IN MY ""U.S. BOUGHT"" DVD PLAYER.... BUT NO, I RECEIVE A DVD IN REGION 2, WHICH IS ALL FOREIGN COUNTRIES... BOY OH BOY.. WELL, I SHOULD AT LEAST HAVE FREE EXPEDITED SHIPPING ON THE REPLACEMENT.. THAT'S THE LEAST THEY COULD DO TO HELP MAKE UP FOR THEIR MISTAKE...BRIAN S."
3,A Treat for Fans,"Fans of brothers Emilio Estevez and Charlie Sheen will love seeing them together in this movie. It's not the most perfect movie but it is entertaining, and there are a couple of breathtaking shots of the brothers together that will make you wish Martin Sheen had had many, many more sons. A real treat for the cadre of loyal fans - admittedly mostly sighing females like me - who love this family."
4,"This movie is not great, but many parts are memorable!","A simple plot...one character (Charlie Sheen) wants to live the good life, and the other (Emilio Estevez) just wants to become more... Thank goodness there is no bloody or sex scenes...it would have spoiled the plot. So many one liners that gave me belly laughs. An enjoyable and entertaining movie...the good guys prevail!"
3,Men at work is a classic comedy of the 80's,I used to watch this movie everytime it came on HBO back in the day! My dvd arrived quickly and in brand new shape!
5,funniest movie ever!,this is a really funny movie with these 2 brothers! it's one i can watch over and over and laugh every time! bought this dvd to replace my vhs copy as i no longer have a working vcr...
4,If you live in the LA Basin / So Cal - this is a MUST HAVE!,"Is this an Academy Award winner? NO! But it's a fun and silly and meaningless story that showcases Charlie & Emilio's very dry sense of humor. The real reason to see it and buy it is if you live in Southern California - LA region. Excluding indoor scenes, the entire movie was filmed all around the South Bay, from Palos Verdes to Venice Beach and inland as far as Torrance and Hawthorne. Watch the boys have a beer at Good Stuff in Hermosa....toss garbage cans on Avenue C & the Esplanade.....get into trouble with bad guys late at night, at a faux park staged at Torrance Beach.....fun to see your neighborhood highlighted! I rate it highly and recommend it if you know these towns."
4,"Old looks, new tricks","What can you ask of a toaster? It should heat things. Preferably to a crisp. Um, beyond that, toaster technology doesn't have to be all that high. However, the T75R features just enough minor luxury appointments to make you want to upgrade. The defrost button is particularly nice for fans of frozen waffles--it extends the cooking time just enough so that the item thaws and then goes immediately into toasting. The wide slots are perfect for bagels, and they cleverly close up for thinner items like Pop-Tarts. The brown level is easily adjustable and has an impressive range, from barely to blackened. And, no doubt, the thing looks cool. (Speaking of which, the ""cool steel"" part means the sides do not heat up during operation--the red parts are safe to touch during toasting.) I picked this up on a Gold Box offer and I'm glad I did; true to its name, it's classic and classy."
4,It toasts...really!,"OK, if you're reading this, you're probably already thinking, ""Why is it so hard to find a toaster that...well...toasts?"" And no matter how much, or how little, you spend, this ""simple"" appliance keeps missing the mark *by that much*? Well, buy this toaster! It looks cool (unlike some of the other weirdly-shaped, overly-techie versions out there); it is easy to de-crumb (without it divesting itself of the crumbs all over the counter); and, *most importantly* it toasts: any thickness of bread product, to any degree of darkness, evenly across the surfaces--and without charring the outside and leaving your frozen stuff icy in the centre, and without making PopTarts Flambe!"
1,Don't fall for the nostalgia,"For a 75th anniversary production piece, Toastmaster ought to find another line of work than producing toasters. Haven't thought much of this company for a number of years, but fell for the retro look, thinking it might also mean retro quality. Nice exterior. Too bad nice styling was married to lousy performance. Never tasted doughy toast before this experience--essentially browned on the outside and raw on the inside. Too, today, it's an easy matter for all toasters to include a ""lift"" feature that raises toast an extra fraction of an inch for those smaller than normal slices that don't extend beyond the top of the toaster when done. There's no reason to have to dig into the toaster to bring up the slices. Most toasters today don't hold a candle to their forerunners of the the pre-cheesy eras of the 50s and before. This model from Toastmaster looks beautiful, but if you're interested in more than decoration, buy another product."
2,Unimpressive,"I tried to like this book but failed miserably - the last straw was the apparent equation of Buddhist meditation techniques to Christian prayer. As Buddhism is agnostic while Christianity believes in a personal God with whom one enters into a personal relationship. I can cite the influence of Nestorian Christianity on Chan Buddhism or the influence of monotheist Islam on Tibetan Buddhism and I still can't make the leap the author does.The overemphasis, from my perspective, of the individual prayer and minimized reference to corporate prayer also clashes with my view of Christians composing the Body of Christ.On the positive side, some of her examples drawn from her role as spiritual director and her interest in playful prayer speaks of a woman of spiritual depth. This volume make speak to you in a way it fails to speak to me."
4,kids' spinning horse musical jewelry box,"My 7-year-old granddaughter loves this cute jewelry box; when you open the lid there is a small horse that spins around to the tune of ""My Old Kentucky Home."" It was advertised as playing ""Home on the Range"" but my granddaughter doesn't really care what tune it plays. It appears to be a sturdy little jewelry box, but I wouldn't give it to a child much younger than 7 because of the potential for breaking that delicate little horse off its spinner."
2,cheap cheap cheap,Not what I was expecting. The tool on the back to wind it up broke in the first 2 weeks.
5,Stallion stable music box,I obtained this for my granddaughter and I know she will love it. It is gorgeous and well made and worth the money I paid. The horse picture on the music box is beautiful and bigger than I expected. I tried to do the feedback but unable to finish.I would recommend this music box to any horse lover.
2,Very let down,"This is the first book I have purchased by this author, and probably the last. I was let down with the contents of the book. I expected something totally different than what I opened the book to read. I found the book was full of the different types of divination with little explanation about what it was. Many of the different kinds were not even explained in any manner other than a short description that was average... I expected this book to be at least a little above average after reading the description and seeing a few people recommend the book. The explanations were too brief."
5,Very Good Read,"My husband ordered this for us to read and before either of us could begin, our son borrowed it and has thoroughly enjoyed it. Highly recommend."
3,"I paid more for the shipping & handling, than I did for the wave cap.","I think this is ridiculous ...Item(s) Subtotal: $5.99Shipping & Handling: $6.05-----Total Before Tax: $12.04It's a nice wave cap, it's kind of tight, and has to be broken in like any of Titan's products ~lolThe reason I'm giving 3 stars, instead of just 1. Is because it's original. You won't find this type of hat/wave cap in the store. In your local Rite Aid stores, they sell these. ( but just the regular round ones )However, if this Black / Solid Spandex Pin Wheel Visor Cap was in Rite Aid. I would be getting 2 for the price of one. Considering, how I paid. $6.05 s&h; !"
4,Keep it with you,"This is a handy booklet to keep in your flyfishing equipment. The leader info is excellent though I found the diapgrams to tie a few of the noes a little confusing. My major beef isthat it is described as a ""streamside guide"" it should then come with a waterproof case or something to protect the pages. I use a small ziplock bag to keep mine dry"
2,Guide to fl fishing knots,This is a small quickly done booklet that lacks step by step instruction and contains confusing drawings. Take a look at some other knot books before you purchase.
4,Guide to Fly Fishing Knots.,"This pocket booklet has all the necessary fishing knots and angler will need in the field. It also has good diagrams on how to tie each knot. I will put this booklet in my fishing box or vest and carry it in the field all the time. It is not too big and not too small, but just the right size to put into a zip-lock bag."
5,Great Book,Worth the money. Great learning tool for knots and where to use them. I keep this in my tackle box.
1,Danse de Rue Review,I am a International Professor of Savate in France. Not impressed at all by this book. What is shown is not savate. it's a mixture of other martial arts incorporated to Savate and doen't follow the international guidelines for Savate. The Wip is form Spain and South America and TEXAS. It has NEVER been part of Savate.
5,The Kiss,"I'm buying this again as a gift for a friend , who like me is unmarried and terminally romantic. The final kiss in Persuasion is to my mind one of the great film kisses of all time, and certainly one of the great Masterpiece Classic ""moments"". Brilliant, just brilliant. It is iconic in its representation of the idealized culmination of romantic longing--longing which Austen so masterfully cultivated in her brilliant tales of fiercely ""modern"" women. Any educated woman with a pulse (also must have an ability to suspend cynicism for happy endings) will love this set!"
5,Sense & Sensibility,My friend and I watched it as we traveled with our husbands - it was so interesting and suspenseful. We both said we want to watch it again - we probably would enjoy watching it a several times. The acting was wonderful - and the chemistry of the cast was perfect.
4,Jane Austen films,"I really appreciate that these three films are available in one set, but I would have appreciated if the new version of Emma had been put in the set instead of Miss Austen Regrets. In addition, the packaging is a little annoying. Sense & Sensibility and Persuasion/Miss Austen Regrets have their own ""folders"" in the set box. I infinitely prefer BBC's packaging for Wives and Daughters/Cranford/North & South which has all the discs in one ""folder"". That style of packaging is a lot more convenient. But as for the Jane Austen films themselves, they run very smoothly and the editing is great. It is a joy to watch the films and see how the interpretations do the books justice."
3,Does Not Measure Up,"I love Jane Austen books/movies! This 2008 version suffers in comparison to the 1999 version. None of the actors in this version outperform those in the earlier version. This version boasted some spectacular scenery. The storyline, along with the performances, unfortunately, couldn't hold my attention."
1,Not happy !!!,I am really angry no one told me I could'nt play BBC DVDs on my DVD player. now I have to return it at my own expense!!
5,Excellent movies,Both movies are so well made. The use of actual locations takes you easily back in time to the days of Jane Austen. Such a wonderful series of movies with great actors playing their parts so well.
2,Poor Subtitles,"I would have given this DVD 5 stars: the story adaptation is excellent, the actors performances are excellent, the filming is excellent; but, if you have any hearing impaired viewers then skip this DVD. The subtitles/captioning is very poor. Usually only the first few words of a sentence. Impossible to follow the story line."
4,Sense & Sensibilities,Both my wife and I enjoyed this production very much although probably not as much as the version with Emma Thompson & Kate Winslet.
4,Great addition,A wonderful collection to our growing collection. Well acted and a bit of the unexpected in the story.
4,Jane would love it!,Wonderfully sublime! You won't be disappointed by this masterful rendition of Ms. Austin's classic.
5,It gives my wife something to do while I watch football,"My wife loves this stuff. Personally, I don't get it. But getting these movies for her for Christmas amounted to about 10 quality football hours for me, that's why I give this product 5 stars. Just make sure you have two televisions! Enjoy"
4,Very Well Done,"Easily the best BBC Jane Austen adaptations my wife and I have seen. Very well done with compelling casts. We wish that they had edited together the three Sense and Sensibility episodes rather than leaving in the 'next time on...' and 'previously on...' and maybe a little less of the racy beginning to that film.Though both were different in approach, to me both had leads that really helped you feel what they were feeling."
1,The dirge version,"OMG; how grim and dirge-like the pacing of this version is. With so little hint ofJane Austen's humor that, at times, even in the darkest passages,can be hilarious.I especially miss Willoughby's mentioning Sir John mentioningthe black pointer puppy during Willoughby's long, mostly sorrowful, apologia to Eleanor.It's emblematic of how much of what makes Austen Austen they have left out.It always takes me aback how TV or movie writers think they know more thanJane Austen who's been in print these two hundred years.The Emma Thompson/Ang Lee version may miss the mark in lots of ways, butstill has far more of the life of the original."
3,disappointed by the trailers in between each episode,"I watched the BBC production of Sense and Sensibility in the UK and really enjoyed it. I couldn't wait to get the dvd. You can imagine how very disappointed I was to find that at the end of an episode(there are 3)and the beginning of the next, there's "" previously"" or ""coming up next"" snippets. Who edited this dvd? It's awful. I want to see the production without that. I have the dvd, so why would I need that? It's lazy editing. I am requesting my money back or exchanging it for a dvd that does not have the mini trailers included."
3,Good but not great,"This version seems like it was only made to complete the Jane Austen series by Andrew Davies. This version certainly did not improve on the 1995 version with Emma Thompson and for the most part it imitated it, even some of the actors seem to be clearly chosen with the actors from the '95 adaptation in mind. I did appreciate it including the scene where Willoughby comes to talk to Elinor in the middle of the night after his unhappy marriage but, really whatever extra details were included the emotional intensity and depth of characters did not reach that of the previous Hollywood adaptation.As far as Miss Austen Regrets goes, it was a miserable movie but then again so was Jane Austen's life. Worth watching once, an interesting interpretation, but not the sort of thing you'd want to watch again and again."
5,You have to see this,"This is my very favorite version of Sense and Sensibility. It is so much better than the other version with Emma Thompson and Hugh Grant.. Dan Stevens who plays Edward is much more handsome and has that wonderful British accent. I also thought Hattie Morahan did a much better job of protraying Elinor and David Morrissey, as Colonel Brandon is so dashingly handsome. I am sorry but everytime I see Alan Rickman I only see Severus Snape on Harry Potter."
4,Almost completely wholesome,"I highly suggest fast forwarding through the first minute. The producers added a scene that was completely unnecessary. We don't really need to see Willoughby seduce a girl. Otherwise this movie would be completely family friendly. A great Jane Austen film. I liked it better than Emma T, Hugh Grant, & Kate Winslet's version."
3,"David Morrissey Steals Every Scene He's In, Thank Goodness","David Morrissey is the best reason to watch this program. He perfectly portrayed Colonel Brandon opposite a variety of miscast, less experienced actors. Morrissey shines in spite of Hattie Morahan's expressionless eyes, Charity Wakefield's whiny voice, and Dominic Cooper's lack of charisma.Andrew Davies did an excellent job of adapting Sense & Sensibility to a multipart series. But this program would really be a standout if the producers had done a better job of casting.The lame, unsatisfying ending only adds to the viewer's frustration. After 3 hours of watching the story progress, we're left with Edward Ferrars chasing chickens.Any movie producer attempting the next adaptation of Sense & Sensibility needs to budget for a wedding scene instead of cheaping out with chickens."
4,Collector's Set,"Sense & Sensibility excellent; adapted by the wonderful Andrew Davies; however, Emma Thompson's adaptation should not be missed; Persuasion disk was damaged which is a great disappointment"
4,Sense before Sensibility,"Some have said that this movie is too sensual and in that regard falls short of the Jane Austen novel. I can't comment on that since I have not read the novel. I assure the viewer though that everything in the movie has it's place and does not seem unwarranted. Each scene follows logically and is needed for the climax, which in Jane Austen's case is the fact that true love always triumphs. Andrew Davies is doing us no harm by showing how detrimental passion can be in a relationship if not regulated by attention to good moral behavior. A person's character, rather the goodness of his character, is the greatest protector of love, and we must all draw that lesson. I enjoyed the movie and wished for an even longer ending."
4,Austen almost as written.,"I have collected all the books by Jane Austen and various DVD treatments. Both Sense & Sensibility and Persuasion in this collection represent a more accurate rendering of the books then the other two dvd's I have. Don't get me wrong Emma Thompson's Sense and Sensibility is wonderful, but this version is more true to the book. The 1995 Persuasion with Amanda Root is very good, as is the acting, but the story is just too different from the book. I will be keeping all copies though because each one is a story of it's own."
4,Two Beautiful Stories Come To Life,"Two of Jane Austen's beloved tales are vividly brought to life in this set. Sense & Sensibility is done very well and surpasses the ""Emma Thompson"" version. The music is especially beautiful. Persuasion is enjoyable to watch but I greatly prefer the 1995 production starring Amanda Root and Ciaran Hinds. This version lacks something. Both are best enjoyed after reading the novels themselves. Miss Austen Regrets is included and I suppose that is because it would not sell on its own."
5,Wowza.,"This is awesome. Its a difficult novel to get right on the screen because there are so any levels to it and personalities hiding behind the stiff upper lips - but this version just has the right ""finish"". I've already watched it twice within 2 weeks. This is a great one to watch again and again and again and..."
3,Persuasion: film vs book=apples vs oranges,"The 2007 BBC version of Persuasion is pure soap opera. Then again, if the video Persuasion were true to Miss Austen's book, it would have to be 12 hours long! Still, real violence was done to the book at end of the video; instead of the leisurely tete-a-tete with her semi-invalided friend, Mrs Smith, in which all the devious and sinister machinations of her cousin are gradually revealed, in the film version Mrs Smith miraculously arrises from her sickbed and breathlessly meets Anne Elliott on the street, where she tells all--IN TEN SECONDS(!), after which Anne does a lot of running, hither and yon. I guess the director wanted to wind things up IN A HURRY, and didn't want the film to drag on for 4+ hours, like the earlier, 1970's BBC version. The 2007 BBC DVD version was good for the costumes and settings, a real ""costumer,"" but for those who haven't read the novel, I hope it will at least pique your interest enough to read it."
5,I love this movie. (or is that greatly esteem?).,"OK,Now look I am a guy. I don't own a ""Man Purse"", am not sure what Quiche is. But I love this movie. (or is that greatly esteem?).Now for you other men out there, be forewarned, this movie contains no violence involving weapons or explosions. But it does involve great battles of pride, propriety, and passion.This story, from Jane Austen, talks more to the human condition between men and women than anything you could find in the world of uncensored publications.This movie's production, the scenes, the actors, all show that although the social norms in the age of Jane Austen have since evolved, their essential nature continues.So, for you real men out there who wish to understand more about the other side, and perhaps a bit about yourself, put down your tools, and pick up this instruction manual.Regards,"
3,Sense and Sensibility,"While this story followed the book and was well acted, I was extremely disappointed with it. A made for TV movie was made into the DVD without being edited.It was divided into segments with what was to come next; what happened last segment; and credits in between.When selling this as a movie; especially with all of the current technology, surely it could have been cleaned up to take out these highly intrusive details."
3,Bought the collection from [...]...,"I ordered the Sense and Sensibility Collection with the following three films: Sense and Sensibility, Persuasion, and Miss Austen Regrets. I only received Sense and Sensibility and Persuasion. After speaking with Sandeep Kumar and returning the collection with the missing film, I received the same exact collection without Miss Austen Regrets. After speaking with Chai D., I was only refunded $[...], when I paid for about $[...] for all three films. If the price of three films is $[...], then I should have been able to receive $[...]. After years of being a loyal customer to Amazon, I felt that I could have done better with a different service. As a Legal Assistant in a law firm, I will discuss this matter with the attorneys I work for, and will continue to spread the word about this disservice."
3,authentic,Loved it! This version of Austen's Sense & Sensibility is one that follows the book closely. The acting is seamless and superb. I believe David Andrews has captured what i believe is the true feel of Austins' period.
4,"Yes They finally had a swordfight but did he kill, maim or just nick him a little",This particular incarnation plays fast and loose with the story line. This is one in which you need to forget about the book and enjoy the story. The sword fight fits in (but not in line with the book). Willoughby finally stuck it too far... but did it get nicked. Love wins out. Just differently than some expect. They also treated the Margaret character with a dose of existingEveryone forgets that the Ladies Dashwoods had servants.
4,Charming,"This is a very well done adapation of my favorite Jane Austen novel. I thought Hattie Morahan hit the role of Elinor perfectly and she had great chemistry with Dan Stevens as Edward Ferrars. I fell in love with Charity Wakefield by the end of the series and I hope to see more of her in the future. The production quality of the series was also very well done for a made-for-tv production, but then BBC usually does a good job. I highly recommend this wonderful mini series to everyone."
5,Excellent!,This version does justice to the book and is exquisitely filmed. The casting is perfect. I've watched every screenplay of Austen's works and this is perhaps the best of them all.
5,Amazon Service and the DVD are both SIX+++ stars!,"Amazon and the DVD are both SIX+++ stars! Amazon service, especially during the holiday, was awesome. I plan to do much more ""AMAZON shopping."" Thank you for exceptional service and quality material/products. Dr.Scott"
5,Breanna M.,"This version of the Austen classic was fantastic, far better than the version with the more well known actors. True to the story line and portrayed by outstanding artists."
4,Sense & Sensiblity Collector Set,This was a worthwhile investment try to the Jane Austin style these movie left we want to see more.
2,A bit empty!,"I am a Jane Austin fan. This movie lacked a lot! The actors and acting were very weak! There are good produced ""S & S"" movies made but not this one."
4,sense without sensibility,"the best ""sense & sensility"" is the one with Emma thompson and kate winslet this one is a grand production from the BBC but some caracters were lacking in passion and in their personality acording to the book. it was hard for me to believe their acting and get the feeling of the movie. like mrs dashwood and elinor and mr eduard ferrar and mrs jenkins.the music was beautiful and the scenary and the houses but still is not as good and touching as the old one."
4,"""Miss Austen Regrets"" a valuable portrait of Jane Austen.","Jane Austen was a complicated person who was very poorly represented in the calm placid portrait of her that is usually reproduced. ""Becoming Jane"" gave us a young athlete who planned a runaway elopement. This film balances that Jane at age 20 with a mature woman who has had disappointments and troubles. The script is much more fact-based and uses many of JA's words. Olivia Williams is a better image of Jane Austen than the prettied-up portrait her Victorian relatives created. However, the tone here is too grim. Even in the last months of her life, she was writing letters full of jokes to her nephew and nieces, began a very funny novel, ""Sanditon"" and wrote a long comic poem about Winchester."
4,ANOTHER PERSPECTIVE,"These versions are MOST EXCELLENT even though the earlier ""Persuasion"" with Ciarin Hinds and then Emma Thompson,Alan Rickman and Hugh Grant's,""Sense and Sensibility"" are hard to surpass. ""Miss Austin Regrets"" was a wonderful perspective on the life of Jane Austin. I will watch these versions again and again!"
5,Sense & Sensibility Collector set,"Excellent selection from the PBS mini-series of Jane Austen novels. The Sense and Sensibility was different from the one with Ema Thompson, but it was still excellent. Never read the novels though so I cannot tell which version was more accurate. Anyone interested in Jane Austen should view thiscollection."
2,my ears!!!,"I bought this scale to weigh food, with the added benefit that I could use it to weigh mail. unfortunately, I currently am not using it for either due to the fact that it emits an ear-percingly loud, high-pitched tone for several seconds after it is turned on. I think the tone is to tell you not to place anything on the scale while it calibrates, but what it actually does is prevent me from wanting to use the darned thing. I can find no reference to the tone in the very small instruction sheet and the only way I've been able to figure out to avoid the sound is to not use the scale."
1,It's NOT a kitchen scale,"I ordered this for a friend for Christmas, because she wanted a digital kitchen scale. I was VERY disappointed to get it and find it clearly labeled as a postage scale. It is not designed for easy use in the kitchen, but rather for, you guessed it, postage."
5,Best waflles,"I received a Toastmaster waffle baker, model 252 about 23 years ago, it still works well but it got dropped on the handle, so now it is difficult to manage. I came online to find another one just like the one I had. So I'm please to find another one. When the kids were home I would make waffles to get them out of bed."
2,Waffle Iron,I used my new waffle iron for the first time today. The light doesn't work so you have to guess when it is warm enough and when the waffles are done.
2,Get a Better (Working) Product,"...Now, I don't know, maybe it was just the particular one that I bought but the waffles were coming out perfect on the bottom but on the top, it was as if the iron wasn't even on. When I went to return it at the store, I saw another 3 people in line to do the same thing, so I'm thinking someone forgot to plug something into the right spot on this waffle maker while it was going through the assembly line.Hope you all have better luck than me with this!"
2,Ultimate Naked Fighting,Not by any stretch of the imagination can I call this fighting--However the girls are fine to look at.
5,Nice!,This is my boyfriend's favorite movie and so I purchased this and put it in a frame and it's hanging in our familyroom. Great quality! Thanks!
2,A Bit Let Down,I had high hopes for this book but feel somewhat disappointed. I saved it for my trip and in the end it could not keep my attention. It needed more of the human touch. Maybe it was me but I needed a little more humor and interest. Advice was a bit obvious.
3,Ferry please please get away from MOS albums,"Why oh why does a brilliant master of the trance genre feel he has to keep churning out turgid Ministry of Sound compilations?. These mixes are great for those just getting to grips with the sound but true fans look elsewhere. The MOS comilations seem have that 60s thing about the 3minute sound bite ie the mixes are way too short, the tracks used are usually old and found elsewhere months before release by MOS and lastly there are always too many fillers on anything they release. Ferry has done much much better and will do again, This album gets 3 stars for nothing more than the brilliant Armin Van Buuren mix of the best thing released in 2001- 'Rapture' by Iio."
2,Trance going downhill?,"I love Ferrys work...so i do not fault him for this CD. More and more, trance seems to be going vocal, to feed the appetite of those who cannot live without vocals in their songs. Its sad...seeing people depend so much on vocals in a song to make it a song. One of the reasons i got into trance is that there were no vocals...it was different, not distracting, and even at 140-160 BPM, it was relaxing. Now, with all the vocal releases coming into the scene, artists are concentrating less on melodies, and more on just banging out another track. I will not fault Ferry for this...it's just the scene. Look at the old classics we used to have (Binary Finary - 1998, Armin - Communication, System F (ferry) - Out of the Blue..) compared to whats ""hot"" now (Kosheen - Hide U, Tukan - Light a Rainbow, Gouryella (ferry) - Ligaya...) Its sad."
3,A good machine once it's modified,"The Toastmaster Food Slicer is a solid, well-built machine that slices well. I didn't like the safety-feature built into the power switch, which requires constant use of one hand to keep the power on, leaving only your one other hand to hold the food you're slicing, which is very inconvenient and could be a safety hazard; so the manufacturer's safety feature is somewhat self-defeating. I modified the machine to disable the safety feature, which yielded a machine whose performance I am very satisfied with."
5,Adorable,I treated myself to this pot as I have recently been brewing loose tea. I love the adorable raised fish pattern. I was also worried it would be hard to pour but it is balanced and pours very easily. I have not had a rusting problem and that may be because I'm not washing the pot after use....with the tea I'm making you are supposed to let the residue build up in the pot for the health benefits. Perhaps this reduces rusting? I leave the lid off when I'm done.
1,Completely Disappointing. A Couple Minutes of Preaching,The content is not even something that I would look at on TV for free. No message just a documentary/press tour.
3,5ive - 'Telestic Disfracture' (Tortuga),"Filled with collages of low-key guitar, 5ive's debut effort showcases some decent atmospheric mostly instrumental aggressive stoner rock. Not to be confused with the British 'boy band', for THIS 5ive is a Boston-based duo comprised of guitarist Ben Carr and drummer Charlie Harrold. 'Telestic Disfracture' has just six tracks, four of them run between eleven to seventeen minutes in length. I usually like long tracks, as I do here. Worth pulling out and giving a spin now and again. Able to hold my interest. Just might appeal to fans of Kyuss, Fu Manchu and Sons Of Otis."
5,Patterns also work for Barbie,"I bought this book as I have a couple of Gene dolls and thought it would be nice to try making some outfits for them. I have been making clothes for naked Barbie dolls until now.From reading reviews I was aware of the need to enlarge the patterns but, having recently bought a scanner,copier,printer I hoped I would be able to use it to do the enlargement. I can.However I was delighted to realise that the unenlarged patterns can also be utilised for my Barbie clothes. I have just made a 1940's 2 tone dress for a Mattel My Scene doll and whilst I used a stetch fabric (cotton lycra) in this case I reckon by adding a milimetre or 2 to the side seams I could use a non stretch fabric next time. The patterns that are not as close fitting will be perfect for the barbie dolls.This really is a great book with a lot of useful information."
4,PHAT,"This was a hilarious movie, almost nonstop laughter. This is a classic comedy and should be preserved on DVD."
4,3 Stooges style slapstick for mordern times,"The Fat Boys are perfectly cast as the bumbling, yet ""with it"" orderlies. The boys foil the feindish nephew's attempts with clever plans and hilarious results. The slapstick humor is bountiful and has a sound track that brings back memories from a time ""not so long ago"". A must buy for fans of the 3 Stooges/ Abbott & Costello."
5,LOVE IT!,"The Fat Boys are excellent comedy actors. If you are comedy fan, Disorderlies is a must have!"
2,Three Stooges Of Rap,"The Fat Boys are nurses aides, hired by Anthony Geary because he hopes their ineptness will hasten the death of his rich uncle, played by Ralph Bellamy. Very bad movie, with Geary overacting, and unecessary star cameos thrown in. Only the rap songs, esp. the Fat Boys' version of The Beatles' ""Baby, You're A Rich Man"" are tolerable."
5,Disorderlies,"Funny, slap-stick comedy. Happy to have found it on dvd. Our kids(teenagers) love this movie."
4,"I now know what a ""Florida Lie Detector"" is......","The Fat Boys appear in their one and only film as a trio of misfits fired from their original jobs as senior citizen caretakers (Orderlies, hence the title,) and are instead hired as the Orderlies of an aging and ailing multi-millionaire at the behest of his callous and gambling-addicted nephew. Although I had enjoyed watching the film non-stop for the first time last night, the real reason why I had purchased this movie was so that I could once again understand the meaning of what a ""Florida Lie Detector"" was, and thanks to the performance of Rick Zumwalt (who, along with Fat Boy Darren Robinson, passed away,)he lived up to that role perfectly. Rick Zumwalt had also made a few appearances in television shows such as Full House, Perfect Strangers, and my favorite Married With Children. He has also been cast in a few films such as The Disorderlies, Batman Returns, and a few others."
1,Flat,i like the Fat Boys.there beat-bopping is still one of a kind.as actors this film&music were really Flat.in fact the Fat Boys were better in Krush Groove than this film.
2,"Cheap Trick's Rick Nielsen appeares in this funny 1986 flick, from the time of the 'Tricksters fine ""The Doctor"" album","The lovable, chubby rapping Fat Boys did OK here - butthat isn't the problem with this poorly directed film.They are asked to do too much with a hasbeen cast (whywasn't Tom Petersson in it?)...Great Cameos by Brian Wilsonof the Beach Boys and brother Rick Nielsen of Cheap Trick,when they were real good - at the time of the The Doctor.Nielsen is seen wearing his 'The Doctor' t-shirt (XXL)and the 'Boys hijack him from his new '86 VolkswagenConvertible. The last real laugh in the film."
4,"Disorderlies = ""Must see movie""","This has been a favorite for a number of years, However living in New Zealand I could not find it anywhere so a few weeks ago i searched it on Amazon.This movie is funny, quirky and is definately a good watch.It revolves around 3 bumbling guys ""aka the fat boys"" who get picked to look after a desperate son's 'ailing' father. After a business deal gone wrong the son needs money fast and the dollar signs take over. In all there stubbling and bumbling they find a break thru that gives the father a new lease on life much to the son's despair. This is a great family movie, and is a far cry from the smut and dirty language that is taking over movies in the last few years."
5,ICarly:Season 2 Volume 2 Review,I chose this rating because I loved the second volume of icarly just like it first volume. I wished that it had more special features in it but i still liked it a lot. I would recommend this to anyone who is a fan of Icarly.
5,Great buy!,I bought this and the ICarly complete third season for my twin girls age 8. Since we cut our cable bill they do not watch much tv. It is really nice to for them to just pop in the dvd and watch their shows. Both dvd's have lots of their favoriate shows. It's definitely worth the money!
4,Perfect for a Tween.,"My `almost 6 year old' watched a few episodes of iCarly and really enjoyed them, although I am not sure she really understood anything that was going on. Miranda Cosgrove, who plays Carly is the host of a popular webshow and things tend to get a little crazy & silly. Something any tween would love to watch.I think it's fun that they take real situations from real viewers and work it into the show. Your child can go online and submit story ideas, comments, and videos, some of which will be used on air.While I think this TV show is fun & entertaining, it is definitely geared toward older children (I would say 10 years or older). It involves dating, flirting with, & crushing on boys which is definitely not something I want my daughter to learn anytime soon. On another note, if you have a tween, they will love this show. The language is clean & the story lines are a lot of fun!"
1,Expected more,We've had this set for almost 4 years now but it has not been a pleasant 4 years. We loved the pattern right away and the colors matched out kitchen so well but though they say 'microwave safe' they most certainly are not. The dish or mug gets dangerously hot but the food or drink does not. They say 'dishwasher safe' but the dishes chip and crack very easily and have some odd lines running through them. we're looking to replace them and I am sorry about that as I had also invested in some of the serving pieces as well. An expensive lesson.
3,Squatters and aborigines in the outback,"It's worth a read! My first contact with protagonist Detective Inspector Napoleon Bonaparte, motivates me to read more of Arthur Upfield's literary output.Gives us some notions about tribal aborigines in Australia half a century, much as a Tony Hillerman novel does for contempary Navajo. (Regretably, I am not competent to evaluate the reliability of these insights.)Has interesting characterizations of life among squatters in Queensland's outback. Comments on Australia's color line, whose artifacts only recently departed from public policy. Some bits intended to be quite enlightened fifty years ago may strike some readers today as racist. They should press on."
5,"Much more realistic than the movie ""Australia"" :-)","...actually, I liked the movie. But this book is much more hard boiled, full of a lot of detail about the bush ranches. There is a lot of description about the life and the details of the land. The detective sloooowly figures out what happened, with a lot of suspense along the way.--> ""Transformers"" or ""Terminator 3"" it ain't! If you like fast paced stuff and don't care for descriptive detail, this is not for you.Otherwise, it is a really good detective novel in a time-capsule kind of wrapper (by now)"
4,Not Free SF Reader,"The detective's name in this book is Napoleon Bonaparte, so you wouldwant people to call you by a nickname as well. He is a half-caste, sothis colors his perceptions of the world.What is interesting about this book are that Bony's religiousbeliefs are harming him. He is having the 'bone pointed' at him byelders, which will eventually kill him if he cannot solve the case."
4,"Only a little lesss than ideal,","A slightly less than perfect reference for the slightly more than serious amateur or the out of region professional.Somewhat, perhaps necessarily, overlarge for convenient use in the field.Rather beyond the Sunday stroll wildflower fancier.Like any so-called field guide in which all the images are collected in a separate section, actual field identification using PLANTS OF ARIZONA is troublesome. This is a criticism of the book's utility, not of its' excellent content."
4,good guide,"Wish it were more complete, about 1/4 of Arizona plants. Has taught me many flowers and shrubs I didn't know."
4,Good Book,Very informative with great pictures and descriptions. I use this book to identify wild flowers and weeds I find on my hikes in the desert.
2,Not for the curious,"This guide is for the serious students, not for the merely curious. In an effort to show everything, this book provides you with more information that you can use. There are so many plants that are so similar, it's difficult to tell one from the other. However, if you want this kind of detail, this is the book for you. For you, it might be a 5-star book!"
1,save your money!!!!!!!!!,"A B-FLICK IF THERE WAS EVER ONE. BAD ACTING - BAD VIDEO... LAME-LAME-LAME... THE TILTLE IS THE ONLY INTERESTING THING. I DID NOT KNOW WHAT TO EXPECT, AND WITH LOW EXPECTATIONS I WAS SERIOUSLY LET DOWN. THE DVD IS WORTH MORE THAN WHAT WAS BURNT ON TO IT. DO YOURSELF A FAVOR AND KEEP ON BROWSING. ALL ""FIGHTS"" TAKE PLACE IN AN APARTMENT LIVING ROOM, AND THE BUMB THAT LIVES THERE SHOULD NOT GET YOUR MONEY. FAIR WARNING.... THIS DVD SUX"
2,Product Dimensions over stated,"Stamp Pads Dimensions were identified as ""Stamp pads measure 2 1/4 in x 3 3/4 in"" but mine measured 2 1/8 in X 3 3/8 in . Product Dimensions - 4 x 3 x 1 inches make you think you are getting a bigger item then received."
4,Slammin Dance CD,"I have followed Safire since she emerged onto the music scene with her huge dance hit ""don't break my heart"" back in 86. I have seen her perform, and loved all her music videos. This is one true talent. She was by far one of the most popular entertainers in the latin dance/pop movement of the late 80's & early 90's & continues to be very popular. this cd is awesome, all of her dance/radio hits reworked & updated. All vocals are brand new. I understand she will ""retired"" from the freestyle genre to pursue another form of music. I look forward to her next project. safire is a true talent and deserves the attention she once garnered. i love you girl!"
3,Where are the original hits?,"I was anticipating this CD for weeks, and bought it the day it was released. And although I do like the new tunes very much (the duet with Cynthia is a highlight), I think they should have included more of the original hits and fewer remixes. The remixes feel as if they are trying too hard to be current. It's the original versions that jammed clubs back in the day. What would really rock would be a re-release of her debut album, ""Sa-Fire""."
3,interesting but poorly written,"This book, which tells the story of a successful Battle of Little Bighorn, is painstakingly well researched. Obviously, researcher Bill Moody did his job; all the ""players"" of the Gilded Age fall into their obvious roles. The comparisons to JFK don't stop at the brothers in the government or the youthful (unfaithful) President and his pretty wife, though Skimin claims that the book is not intended to be compared to ""Camelot.""The problem is that either Skimin is a terrible writer or his editors had it in for him. The book is riddled with grammatical and stylistic errors, especially ""it's"" for ""its."" At first it's just annoying, but after awhile the errors really detract from the enjoyment of the story."
1,Not worth the effort,"...and I hate to say that, because I was really, REALLY looking forward to reading this book! Alternate histories fascinate me (as they do many readers) and although I'm happy to say that the author appears to have a good grasp of Custer as a personality and doesn't paint him as a heartless, Indian-hating, glory-grabbing brute (which is refreshing!), his style is extremely dry. The research is sound, but it's more like reading a history textbook than a novel. So, if you're looking for a teeth-rattling page-turner, I'm afraid this isn't it. ""Marching to Valhalla"" is a much better bet!"
5,Great Unit,This is very easy to install and remove....Keep one key in the glove box and one one your key chain and you'll never have an uhh-oooh moment.
3,Pretty little girl jewelry music box,The description was clear and the illustration was done well. The grandchild that received this music box was so pleased especially to find the little hidden boxes in the sides of the jewelry box.
1,Opened and Returned,Huge disappointment. The drawers do not stay shut and just flop open when the box is moved even slightly. Considering the size of the box there is actually very little storage. Poor sound quality. Just overall a really bad product.
3,Pretty but Knob for Turning on Music Does Not Stay in Place,"This musical jewelry box is very pretty. It is displayed in my daughter's room, and she does not play with it. From the moment we received it, we noticed that the knob that one uses to turn on the music kept coming off. This is part of the reason we thought it would be a good idea to keep it out of her reach, since she is still young. This knob is a choking hazard. Someone moved her music box, not knowing that the knob falls off easily. Unfortunately, when we checked the box, sure enough, the knob was gone. We have not been able to find it. We have to use the knob from a different music box when we want to play the music. The box should be more durable that that."
5,Jewlrey Box,The box was a bit smaller than I would have thought... but it was beautiful and my granddaughter LOVED it! Beside what Santa got her I think it was her favorite thing. She loves horses and this jewelry box is just right for the little girl that wears jewlrey and loves horses!
5,Deluxe Sequence,It's a great family game that the whole family can enjoy together! My 2 young sons ask to play the game every night. I was extremely satisfied with the game.
5,Sequence game,"I bought one game for our 11 year old granddaughter for Christmas and one for my husband and I. We had played it with some friends awhile back and really enjoyed it with three couples playing. Our granddaughter loved the game, in fact, she got it out at Christmas and we all took turns playing and challenging each other for several days- there were eleven of us. I feel it helps the young teenagers think and strategize - good for mind acuity,"
5,Great card game for all ages!,A classic game that will never get old. Portable too to take on long trips or vacations! Kids will love this game as much as the adults. A great family game to have!
3,The item received,Very honest treatment I do recommended it to all my friends best regards to the dealer and the site management
5,DELUXE SEQUENCE,i LIKE THE DELUXE SEQUENCE GAME. THE MAT WAS BIG AND EASY TO SEE. WHAT A GREAT GAME TO PLAY!
5,Deluxe Sequence,This is the perfect game for all ages.It is competitive and so much fun.I play this game once a week with a group of friends;we play for three or four hours.
4,My 13-year-old stepson loves this game!,We can play this game for hours! It's deceptively simple but takes some strategy to win so we're all challenged...but not enough to really have to think hard enough to hurt. ;-)
3,To little,I ordered this one in error its to small I should have ordered the jumbo size but the box is already open.
4,Deluxe Sequence fun for young and mature,Played this game with a dozen of us participating and enjoyed it enough to buy one for us and our twin grandchildren!
4,Mental game,"This game combines a fun experience with using your brain to plan strategy several moves ahead. This deluxe version, however, has a game ""board"" that rolls up to fit in the box. Unfortunately, it doesn't flatten out completely when you play on it. A folded cardboard game board would be superior to this. I am disappointed that the ""deluxe"" version doesn't have the more secure game surface."
5,Fun with my Grandchildren,"Sequence is a fun card game for all the family. My grandchildren live across the entire US from my home state so I fly to see them. The internet helps me with all my visits. I order from Amazon and the purchase is there before I arrive with the grandchildren already excited and ready to play. I don't have to shop till I drop before the trip, lug the ""happy"" all over the airport, or try to find it somewhere in my luggage the minute I arrive. Thanks Amazon for excellent service."
4,Sequence Card game,"This is a great ADULT game, too. Have spent many hours enjoying it. Was introduced to it at a Ladies Night Social of about 10 women.I would recommend it highly."
4,Fun and challenging,"I love this game because it has to do with cards and has a strategic challenge. It's not a noisy game with lots of yelling and table smacking. You and your gaming friends get to team up in a comfortable quiet manner and play a game that involves of mix of multiple card games all in one. Only wish the roll up mat was a little thicker and unfolded instead of roll out but thats no big deal, well worth the cost for this fun game."
5,The Best chalenging game,"This game is fabulous, very easy to learn and very chalenging to win. It is a very mice tool for family fun coz it can chalenge all ages"
5,Great game for college.,"My fraternity brothers and I played this game way too much, but we had a blast doing it. You need a keen eye, attention to every possible way to place five chips in a row, and the guts to count on your opponent not having a remove jack. (Jacks either remove a chip or are wild depending on how many eyes they have!)A quality game to say the least and very easy to learn and one that takes time to master."
3,Stick with the Non-Deluxe Version,"Not impressed with the Deluxe Version. Not much different from the regular version. Only difference is a heavy duty vinyl mat with a non-skid back. Here's the problem: the mat, if you keep it stored in the game box, does not lie flat when you take it out. I'm not sure why MSRP is twice that of the original version."
3,Save money,"This is a fun game for family and friends. Easy to play, not a lot of strategy. The cheaper, basic version is just as much fun, no need to buy this deluxe version. I have both, and I prefer the less expensive."
5,GO COWBOYS!!!,I didnt think it was going to be one of my dads fav. things but its so beautiful. its better than it looks. Came on time and fast too. right before christmas.GO COWBOYS!!!!
2,Wandering and Tedious,There didn't seem to be much point to this story. The story wandered and it was not well pulled together.
4,Fresh take on jazz that won't make it to your radio,"Pianist David Berkman gives us a lilting, solid record of mostly original music (save one track, which I appreciate more and more from cats who play jazz these days) with an incredible band (Brain Blade - drums; Chris Cheek - tenor; Sam Newsome - soprano; Duick Oatts - alto/flute; Ugonna Okegwo - bass). The songs bounce and swing and fall squarely in the vein of, say, where Charles Fambrough was hitting back in the early/mid-ninties. This is what Joshua Redman hears in his head when he plays. Not smooth jazz and not dusty...a beautiful middle ground of traditions and voices. Track 8 best exemplifies what's right with this record all around, so go ahead and take a risk on an underrated album that'll make people notice you when you play it in the office, car or house party."
2,Why I'm upset,I needed this book for one of my college couses and have been using it. Then I have come to notice that a portion of the book i have to do my final on has 13 pages ripped out of it and 11 more in another chapter. Im pissed because I spent my money on this book that the dealer had stated was practically new and whole pages are ripped out of it. Pages I actually need for my class. So now I feel like I waisted my damn money.
2,disappointed,"I don't understand why the book deserved 5 stars (that misled my purchase), I think that it deserves 2 at most.I don't believe that it is all what Mark has to transmit us, its experience should surely be a lot richerit don't provide or describe important strokes, shots or hints (for example, what about the forearm pronation on smashes or clears). It also has, almost consecutively, repeated pictures without providing a new point of view.With determination, I don't recommend it (and I recommend Mark that don't let his name be used in such a way)."
1,Huh?,"I guess it's a masterpiece if you consider things done by junior high school theater departments with no budget a masterpiece. I'd say two words descriptions-- ""Super Eight"" or ""no budget"" or ""no acting"" or ""public airwaves"" or ""styrofoam sets"" or ""Halloween costumes"". If you want this done right, rent some early John Waters movies. This is only good if you are looking for a laugh at the directors expense."
5,Solar Passive Architecure,"Any book written by Prof N. K. Bansal is a masterpiece, which is a result of his contributions in research and development and his innovative thinking."
4,Insightful!,"The Origin and Evolution of New Businesses When Jann Wenner launched Rolling Stone magazine, he did no market research and considered himself merely an ""amateur journalist."" When Bill Gates and Paul Allen started Microsoft, they had no business plan, only a brainstorm that they should write a program in the BASIC computer language. Such seat-of-the pants planning is typical among entrepreneurs, says author Amar Bhide. Successful entrepreneurs don't need unique ideas and long resumes, Bhide writes. Rather, they must be able to adapt quickly to changing business conditions, and they must enter industries in a state of upheaval, where established players are lacking. Bhide offers a revealing look at the characteristics that make for successful start-ups. In spite of his often-dense prose, Bhide gives plenty of real-world examples to illustrate his concepts. We [...] recommend this book to entrepreneurs and to those thinking of starting their own companies."
4,Entrepreneurship,"An excelent buy, helps a lot to understand not how to be an entrepreneur, but how to avoid mistakes taken by new-entrepreneurs.A must read, in terms of developing our career, in a start-up time!"
4,This review of the larger 310 page book,"As usual, the Insight Guide relies heavy on photography for a visual feel of the country, probably 40% of the book is photographs, the quality of which is good to very good. With 80 pages of Maltese history, you will get more in depth history here than with any of the other travel guides.The text does not pull any punches with discussing Malta & its people when it comes to their love of killing birds, leaving trash around, stealing car parts, overbuilding the island, being stubborn, or being horrendous drivers. But there is also an understanding and appreciation for the natives. The essays on Maltese people, their vehicles, the architecture, and superstitions are good. The last 20 pages of travel tips are helpful, the hotel recommendations adequate, the description of the various areas of interest detailed.This book is too cumbersome to take along, this is more for pre-trip research. A good book if you are heavy into the history end..."
5,Vintage Grusin,"If you love Dave Grusin, you'll love this--his elegant playing is gorgeous throughout--laid back jazz piano with tasteful orchestrations. Beautiful, atmospheric, moody. Lush, smoky sax (wish there were a credit for who's playing!!!), shades of easy-listening, flavors of 50's/60's jazz, even a few classical overtones--all so well done and well recorded that the music is timeless. On ""I'm in the Mood for Love"" Dennis Quaid actually does a nicely serviceable vocal reminiscent of Chet Baker. Grusin is a treasure, one of our most gifted jazz pianists who has also composed/arranged many great movie scores--check them out in his Amazon store--you'll be surprised how many you recognize. This CD takes me to a wonderful place. ""Don't Dream It's Over"" by Crowded House is a nice last-track bonus."
5,ocean life set,"This is a wonderful product, that for me, served 2 purposes. One, the children ask questions all the time about sea life, the other, I have decorated my screen house with these critters, as I am an ocean lover and collect all things from the sea. A great product!"
2,open box,"The package arrived at my home in a banged up box that was already open. It was taped shut very poorly and aparently opened during shipping. The product was not damaged, but I was disappointed by the condition it arrived in."
3,Accuracy Off - Cannot erase memory,"The scale seems off by about 5 lbs showing the weight at about 5lbs less. I don't know if I simply got a lemon, (this looked like a unit that might have been returned by another customer, shipped to me from J&R) Also there seems to be no way to easily erase your memorized last shown weight if you don't want everyone else in your home seeing what it was."
5,Great Scale - No Guessing With This One,"OK, we all know how reliable scales can be; a pound off, 4 pounds off, they make you heavier, they make you lighter. Well after purchasing this one, I popped in some batteries and waited to be disappointed. I stood on the scale and it said I was 6 pounds heavier than the scale I was using previously. Par for the course, or so I thought. I stepped off, went to the kitchen closet and pulled out a brand new 10 pound bag of sugar we had kicking around. I hit the button, waited and stood the sugar on the scale --- 10 pounds on the button. My only disappointment was the realization that I was in fact 6 pounds heavier than I thought. A great scale; love the 5 memory buttons. There are four people in my family, so I've reserved the last button for the 10 pound bag of sugar."
5,the best scale ever,"This scale is true to form and never off [it is the doctor's office -- with all who use it every day -- is the scale that's off]. It stores past weight, measures to the ounce and I've only had to change the batteries once in a year! Absolutely recommend!!!"
5,Good,Works well and I love how it saves weights on individual settings. Don't particularly like the numbers I'm reading but that's another story.
2,not accurate,"I bought this scale and had it for about a week. I found that it gave me very different readings, one right after the other, by as much as 2-3 pounds. This was disappointing, and I have returned it. Perhaps it was just this unit, though I am hesitant to try it again. However, I did like the function of showing the last reading, and my children each had their own button."
1,Such a Disappointment!,"While it would be very helpful to be able to measure body fat percent daily, the methodology of this machine does not work for those taking diuretics. (Diuretic-taking people are thse high blood pressure who have to be very careful about their weight and body fat.)Tanita (the maker) notes that taking a diuretic will skew results, but their descriptions are unclear as to in which direction. The only advice to diuretic-takers in all of Tanita's provided liturature and on its website are to always ""take measurements under the same conditions.""Tanita provides no information as to the reference scales defining ""healthy,"" ""overfat,"" and ""obese"" for someone taking a diuretic. Are these ranges higher or lower for someone on a diuretic than for the ""standard person""? By how much?No answer.Under these conditions, this scale is useless."
1,Waste of Money,"I was shopping for a Scale and when I saw this was very impressed as it was a scale and a Body Fat Monitor at a reasonable rate. It does not give you an option to just weigh yourself. It's very slow and if you have more than 2 persons in your home then it's frustrating. Thought of returning it but Amazon was to charge me $10.0 for shipping. I got it for 20, so it was not worth returning and now I am stuck with it. I do not belive the bady fat monitor is accurate either."
3,User Friendly Rating,Customers with vision problems may find the read out too small. A lager readout is preferred. Otherwise a good product.
4,Not for athletes,"Even though it has been mentioned by other reviewers before I would like to emphasize two points.First, it gives amazingly consistent readings for weight and body fat and seems to be quite accurate. My previous scale was much more inconsistent and inaccurate even though it was a brand name electronic scale.Second, the instructions indicate this scale is not intended for the body fat measurement of athletes - those who work out an average 1 hour a day or more. I guess most people who keep track their body fat also do some kind of sports. And I also guess you need a more expensive Tanita with sports mode if you work out regularly and want to know your actual body fat percentage. Athletes have significantly different tissue composition (more muscle) to that of sedentary people and this is why researchers and companies use a different formula to calculate their body fat percentage."
4,"Weight seems accurate, Fat % less so","I got this scale for two reasons:- Our old scale was too easy to trick. (About 10 pounds depending on how you stood.)- I wanted to watch my fat content.This scale has definitely helped the first point. The scale provides weight acurate to 2/10 of a pound, and seems to be very consistent about it.The fat content on the other hand seems to vary wildly. The scale reports it in 1% increments, however I've seen readings fluctuate by 7%. I have no other way of verifying the fat readings, so it could be telling the truth. But it doesn't seem very consistent."
4,Good for its price,"I looked at a lot of other body-fat scales and read the reviews for them on amazon. Overall, this scale probably delivers the most bang for your buck.The scale delivers what it promises: fast and accurate body fat and weight. It lets you store two settings in the memory. If more than two people will use the scale, it has a guest setting that allows the user to enter age, sex, and height.The interface is not intuitive. I had to read the instructions before I could store my information and weigh in. But overall, it's been a great tool to help me get in shape."
2,Avoid.,I bought this about a year ago for fun. I kept in my purse to use as a place to keep cash I was holding on to in case of emergencies while out. I love the anime and thought it would be a lot of fun and maybe a conversation starter but it was really cheap. It is really hard to open at first and by the time you get any flexibility in to the wallet the image is all broken has crease lines throughout. The quality of this product is very low.
1,Defect,I just opened the stapler this morning and it has the same problem as all the other heavy duty staplers. It will not cut the staple to correct size like it claims. I can send it in for warranty work but then I have to pay to ship it to them. Not sure if it is worth sending it back or for warranty work.
3,Stories Seemed Good,"Had to return this product due to it being falsely advertise as NEW. However, looking through it when I had it...it was just what I wanted literature wise."
2,Misleading,"While these stories may have been handed down, they should specifiy that the content in some are actually quite vulgar and tasteless. This includes a male version of a Lorena Bobbit experience, i.e., husband cuts off his wife's lover's private member and feeding it to her.I had a hard time viewing any of these as a form of cultural insight. Being of Mayan and Aztec descent, I cringe at the possibility that this book may be serve as reference to either cultures' general standards and intelligence levels."
3,"First Time, Every Time?","I have always loved my Cross pens, but lately I am having a problem getting the pen to write the first word. I don't know if the problem is the one described by the other reviewer -- that the ink dries out. If I don't use the pen for 15 minutes, it almost always fails to write the first letter of the next word I write -- I can tell what checks I wrote with the Cross pen when the bank sends me the copies of checks that have been processed. If the check is dated in ""arch,"" ""uly"" or ""une,"" I know I wrote it with the Cross pen. I got these broad point refills hoping that the ink might flow more readily, but they're just as bad. I can't understand why Cross refills have gone from so liquid and reliable 30 years ago to being such a problem now."
2,Genuine Cross refill now Made In China,"I rate this refill 2 Stars for value. Not made in Lincoln R.I. U.S.A. any more, like the original one in my gold Cross pen. For the price I paid for this I expected different. 4 Dollars for what should be a fraction of that price for this Chinese-made pen refill. It does work, but it is still new. Will report back if/when it fails or leaks."
2,Doesn't dim well in our fixtures,"I'm a big proponent of CFLs, so when we bought a house with nineteen recessed ceiling fixtures on dimmers, I immediately looked for lamps for them. I ordered two of these bulbs to try them.Unfortunately, they do not work well in our fixtures. Perhaps it is the type of dimmer switches we have, but they will not dim much. They go from full brightness to maybe 75% of that light level. The incandescent lamps in the adjacent fixtures, meanwhile, go down to a faint yellowish glimmer.Clearly these lamps will not work in all dimmable fixtures. You may want to order just one and see."
2,"Dimmable CFL but it doesn't really, uhhh.... dim...","I'm a major fan of CFLs. I have them all over my house. I finally installed a dimmer with my newly installed recessed lights in my living room and looked all over the place to find these hard-to-find dimmable CFLs. I bought them and tried them along side my soft white incandescents. At full brightness, it is clearly whiter and brighter hands down. Unfortunately when I started dimming, these GEs barely dimmed at all. I would be generous to say that they dim to 50% brightness. What good is a light that's advertised to be dimmable but doesn't really dim? I'm going to return them in hopes that GE or some other company will develop one that actually dims as well as incandescents."
3,good but don't dim,"I really like the clean, crisp light that these produce and the delay is not really noticable and can be overlooked. NOTE: package says ""dimmable - works with most dimming switches"". I have high end Lutron ""designer"" dimmer switches - the GE 21710 does not dim on this switch AT ALL. 20% would be acceptable but I am at 100%. Unfortunately looks like I am stuck with regular incandescents to get my dimming feature which I use all the time."
4,"Works just fine with my dimmer, much lower power consumption","I'm happy with these bulbs which I use in my recessed lighting. The dimming works just fine, they don't get quite as ""dark"" as old-fashioned bulbs before simply turning off but that doesn't bother me. They provide enough light to help my guests find their way to the bathroom at night without being so bright as to keep them awake. I've gotten about a year and a half out of my bulbs with fairly regular use and they still work great. The package says they last 4 years with 4 hours of use per day, mine see 2-4 hours of use per day. I rarely get what the package advertises though. Play it safe and keep your receipt in case these bulbs die too soon."
1,"hey don't dim! Back to the drawing board, GE","I have dimmable recessed lighting in three main rooms facing north and west that are almost always light, even during daytime. So CFLs could make a major dent in our electricity bill, and ease the need to change bulbs in hard-to-reach locations. Dimming is critical in all locations.Tested on _all_ dimmers in our home - including two new ones - this bulb did not dim whatsoever. I tried leaving it on for a while, but the bulb ran a apparent full capacity even when all the incandescent R30s are barely lit. Moving the dimmer has a binary effect on this bulb - just on or off.One slight pro with this bulb is that unlike other CFLs, I've noticed that this one is at full brightness right away."
1,Worst bulbs I've ever bought,"I hate these bulbs. The light is not warm at all, more like industrial lighting. The dim-able statement is a farce. They barley dim at all and then suddenly shut off. If you turn the dimmer switch up the won't go back on until on full. Then you have to start over again. Just as you get a bit down, off they go! It is impossible and all for nothing. It's useless to even bother because they don't dim very much. I want my old expensive to run lights back. At lease I can run them on low and feel comfortable in my home,not in a department store... I'm going to try the new Led lights that dim. I'm hoping for a more comfortable relaxing glow when dimmed."
1,NOT Dimmable,"Avoid this product! These bulbs are advertised as ""Dimmable"" but they do not dim compared to the incandescent bulbs. The lowest setting on our dimmer and the bulb is still very bright. Avoid dimmable CFL style bulbs. They are a waste of money, especially at 6x the cost of incandescent."
2,Do not dim,"I guess I'm not adding anything new. Everyone seems to say they do not dim and I agree! I was hoping for a little more dimming, but there is very little dimming. For a replacement light, it gives good light and I have no complaints, but if the dimming feature is important to you, I don't know what the options are. There doesn't seem to be any CFLs on the market that get good reviews for dimming."
1,not good,oven does not maintain temperature. Tried to cook biscuits in it and they came out flat. Also the broiler burner comes on at high heat and burns the top before the inside is done.
1,Dangerous Item,I purchased this toastmaster # 7093S in March. The oven is dangerous. today 4/10/03 I had a round flat bread in the oven. After about 2 minits the glass door on the front exploaded and sent shattered glass up to 12 Ft. away. The oven is built a little shoddy and slow to do the cooking it should do. I would not recomend this item. Now i have to go thru the hastle of warranty and replacement. I certinly don't want another one of theese. I don't want my family or pets injured.
2,blown away,"bought new ,right before the waranty was up about 11 months the fan blew.sent it in they gave me a different one but it was refurbished with the door missaligned and the chrome coming off.sent it back got another with the front panel corner bent but i kept it .now 8 months later the fan blew on this one too.have to send this one back also .so it is 2 ovens in two years.it did cook well though"
4,Fine product-and great product for the price,"This product does a fine job, especially for the price.It is a convection oven, so the heated air is blown around, decreaseing cooking times, and keeping foods juicier.A couple of posters have had their windows break. This is always a possibility with glass windows in ovens, and often happens on 'regular' ovens as well. It happened to me on a oven I was using just a few weeks ago in a church kitchen. No one was within 10 feet of the oven and the door just exploded.As to one user having problems baking biscuits, I spoke to the owner of a large breakfast & lunch restaurant about baking biscuits recently, and he said that for some reason, biscuits always come out flat when cooked in a convection oven. So they have a dedicated non-convection oven just for biscuits in their kitchen.Anyway, for the money this is a great product."
4,Easy game all in one place.,This is a fun game that could easily be used to help improve math and logic skills although there is also a fair amount of chance invovled. The board seems a little flimsy and I'd be worried about traveling with it too much. I just use it in my home and it's fine. I wouldn't pay full price for it though.
1,Not worth the bother,We play the full sequence game and really enjoy it. This game basically has one location for each card and one deck of cards. There is little to think about and it's really not fun in anyway. The small pieces only make it more annoying. I would not suggest it to anyone for any purpose.
3,A good read about Victorian lady travellers,This book reports on the phenomemon of the Victorian lady traveller. I purchased it because one of my cousins from Scotland was such a traveller.I found it informative and entertaining. I am glad I purchased it.
4,joe,"Great cd, one suggestion is if you buy it go out and pick up a science fiction book like the lord of the rings and listen while reading. It puts you in another world."
3,Not Free SF Reader,"A decent period detective story, very English style, so to speak. You have an avuncular, likable, main character, who is sharper than he appears to those around him, and uses that to his advantage. A bit Middle English Midsomer Murders, almost, you could say, but that sort of style."
4,Cadfael scores again,"Having just visited the Abbey at Shrewsbury, the setting for the Cadfael books, and having had a guide who was very knowledgable about the Cadfael books, I read this one on the plane back to the USA and was enthralled. One warning: the Cadfael series on TV was filmed in Hungary, and TV's 'Shrewsbury Abbey' looks nothing like the real thing."
4,Pretty Good for Light Entertainment,"An English monastery's plan to bring back the bones of a Welsh saint runs into a deadly complication in this undemanding mystery. The setting, medieval England and Wales in the early 12th Century, is no obstacle to enjoying the stroy since the author provides all the historical background and the reader need only supply a little imagination. I found ""Bones"" worth my while largely because of the vivid characterizations and the way it brings the Middle Ages to life. One detail I especially liked was that Brother Cadfael had no regrets about his former life as a soldier in the Crusades. Quick take: While it keeps your attention, ""Bones"" won't make you stay up half the night to finish it."
2,I discern no love of the subject,"Though thisstory was set during mediaevaltimes, in an atmosphere involvingBenedictine monks and Christianliturgical practice, I detected no love on the author'spart of the subject matter at all.She merely used it as a background setting fora mystery.Thus it was a chore to plod throughthe book, as meanwhile the authoris seemingly snickering at these""backward"" ignorant monks.All except the hero, of course, who magicallyjust turns out to be modern-mindedand liberal, (very similar to the characterBrother William, that Umberto Ecoused in The Name of The Rose,to ridicule mediaeval thought).In other words it is a dead giveaway: straightout of the 20th century. Such an incongruitybetween the atmosphere and the main characterbecame a constant distraction and irritation.I do not recommend this book,nor am I moved to read herother works in this series."
2,AVERAGE STORY slow pace,I only listen to audio cds I have listened to many mysteries and enjoy some historical mysteries. I found the overall story line good but was so slow pace at times.I really had trouble finishing it. BUT I was determined to.This story reminds me of WORLD WITHOUT END by Ken Follet which I would give a 5 star to and his other in the series THE PILLARS OF THE EARTH I would rate 4star to.I know we don't all like the same books but if you like this story A MORBID TASTE FOR BONES you will absolutely LOVE the two by Ken Follet.I will not be buying anymore of Ellis Peters. Maybe his later books are a bit more up beat I hope so for his sake. Please so try this story and see what you think.
2,Perfect for insomniacs... will put you to sleep.,"This story starts out pretty successfully. We are shown the life of the brothers in the abbey and their daily routines. This seems to set the tone for a dull plot. Then, the reader experiences the sickness of a brother of the abbey and the mood of the story changes from the placidity of the abbey life to the chaos of trying to help the brother. This livens the book up some, but not enough. Very few exciting events happen between that point until the death of Rhisiart. After Rhsisiart's death, we are thrown back into that state of low-action; only this time, with the added commotion of trying to figure out the murderer's identity. The ending wasn't a huge shocker. It was almost too predictable from the beginning. So, all in all, I would not recommend this book unless you wanted to be easily put to sleep."
3,Might be too slow moving for some,"The story unfolds slowly. I felt that the author spent more time weaving together beautiful prose instead of a solid plot. The combination of medieval setting and murder mystery is compelling, but in the end I found the book to be too slow and predictable. I often found myself counting the pages until a chapter was finished. It was an effort to push through.It is not a bad book, nor is it a great book. If you are looking for a change of pace this may be a good selection. If you are looking for a great mystery, you can do better with Agatha Christie."
2,This book required more patience than I had,"Having seen a number of good recommendations for this novel, I looked forward to reading it, but alas I couldn't get into the story. I say this regretfully since I don't easily give up on books. It doesn't help that the narrative takes its time to get going, with this Brother talking to that Prior using a stilted, high language. Even the words themselves feel slow.Not necessarily a bad book, just not for me."
5,The Start of a Wonderful Series,"This, the original Brother Cadfael novel is great fun to read. It has a slightly different feel from the rest of the series, but it is still vintage Peters with the descriptive language and great humor."
3,"Bland food, but otherwise a good start","I've made a bunch of the recipes in this cookbook, and most have been really bland. Some of the combinations are downright weird and unpleasant. However, this cookbook will be useful to those who--* Have enough knowledge in the kitchen to figure out what the recipes are missing before you start your crock pots and head out for work.* Like bland, underseasoned food. (Hey, a lot of people do!)* Are in a huge hurry and don't mind sacrificing some taste for what are generally nutritious meals.* Are new to the world of slow cookers.Lkie I said, I've used this one a lot, and I find it helpful. It's a great as a beginner slow-cooker cookbook, so you can get used to the appliance and learn some basics like chili and stews. I use it as a guide to adapt other recipes for the slow cooker."
4,Cookbook Review,Lots of good recipes; can add or detract ingredients and still have very good flavor. Index needs to be more user friendly. Enough variety for a wide range of tastes.
5,"Good, simple recipes","There is something for everyone in this book. When my wife is away, I can even crack open this book to the recipes that require 5 or less ingredients and put something together that my kids actually like. There are a lot more recipes in here than I thought there would be when I purchased the book, which was a nice surprise. There are also desserts, stews, various meats, etc. If you want a book that lets you create easy slow-cooker recipes, this is the bible of them all. My only wish it that there were more actual photos of various meals so you could see the finished product."
4,DELECTIBLE SLOW-COOKED RECIPES,"There's just nothing like meat that's been slow-cooked for several hours until it's melt-in-your-mouth-tender. BH&G; slow cooking book provides 416 pages of great recipes and slow-cooking tips to make some of the most mouth-watering dishes ever! A real favorite is the section on one-dish dinners that are so simple to make with five ingredients and yet so incredibly delicious.Wonderful Soups, stews, roasts, ribs, even more exotic ethnic dishes can be found within the pages of this great book. You'll even find recipes for desserts, dips ,etc. Over 400 recipes in all.Slow-cooking is not for everyone..it takes some ambition and some planning to prepare your ingredients and then let it ""go"" byt iteself for as long as 12 hours, but I guarantee you will love the results. My only complaint is not pictures in the book. That is one of my pet peeves about any cookbook."
3,Great Additional Slow Cooker Book,"I really needed another slow cooker book, I had seemed to exhaust the few recipes from the other books, and quite frankly, my kids had too. This book lists so many new things, as stews and soups that this should keep my crocker on the cutting edge for a while. I would recommend this to someone who does not have another recipe book for their slow crocker."
1,"Would be better if they actually tried the recipes, perhaps","This cookbook has no pictures and the recipes are short on flavor. Making food from this book is an insult to the honest ingredients that go into it. Seriously, you could do a lot better with the raw ingredients than what you would get after following instructions in this book. Keep away!! Unless you WANT a big book of untested slow cooker recipes that were likely put together to meet a publishing deadline."
5,Tasty meals,"I've made a couple recipes so far (I just got the book a couple weeks ago), but every one that I've read and the ones that I've made all are very easy to prepare. Not alot of extra hassle for some good home cookin'!"
5,Great 1st recipe book!,I bought this for my daughter to show her the joys of slow cooking. I grew up using a slow cooker and recognized many of the recipes in here. I especially liked the 5 ingredients section. This book is easily four books in one - at a nice price!
5,Best Crock Pot Book,Many varied recipes that one would actually make and ingredients found in the average household. It's a great book when cooking for 2 as well.
4,The Buggest book of Slow Cook Recipes,"I purchased this slow cook recipe book on the advice of one of my daughters. She likes the book very much and encouraged me to buy one. The main reason that I agreed to purchase one is because it has a chapter of recipes with ""5 ingredients only"". I do not like using recipes with a lot of ingredients so I was pleased to find this book. I am very happy with it."
2,no pictures,"I haven't tried the recipes yet, but the book is uninspiring as there is no color and no pictures. Just print print print"
4,Slow Cooker Cookbook,This cookbook has easy to follow quick recipes that are interesting and inexpensive. I throw all the ingredients in the crock pot then off to work and there is nothing better than coming home to a fully cooked meal that is ready to go.
1,"Good if you like processed foods, I guess.","I recently bought this because I was looking for slow cooker recipes and the reviews for this book seemed very favorable. Our family has disliked 4 out of 4 recipes we've tried so far. They all tast very 'processed', almost canned or from a jar. We usually cook all our meals from scratch (not fancy or anything though), so if you're used to frozen meals or canned or pre-processed foods, maybe you'd like it more. All three of my kids had trouble getting through the dinners, for what it's worth."
2,Not very impressed,"As a meat & potatoes kind of guy I expected some basic, good eats. I guess my palate is just not refined enough."
4,"Good, not the best.","I did like this book, however I have given up with cookbooks for the most part and find recipes on the net. I did like the section requiring fewer ingredients."
3,"Not as good as I was hoping, but it works.","I was hoping to get a book with at least 10 good recipes to make for the family that could be easily made in my slow cooker. Some of the recipes are just repeats with a few items added or removed. I guess there really are just a few basic recipes you can make. Still an OK book to have, I did learn a couple of things but really feel like I could had found most of the recipes on the internet."
3,"Ideas are great, recipes are not...","I have yet to find a great crockery cookbook, and I've tried many. I had high hopes for this one, but so far I've tried 3 recipes and they all have fallen flat.The first recipe I tried was for carmelized onions & potatoes. It sounded great, but the end result was really bland. The second recipe was for a main dish - chicken with wine. My husband, who loves chicken, didn't finish it and said it wasn't very good. I tried it and while it wasn't inedible, it wasn't anything I'd make again. My last try was for a raisin pudding cake that sounded delicious. We had friends over and while they said it was good, both my husband and I thought it was way too sweet, and ended up throwing the rest away (and there was a lot).While I have found many cookbooks that have wonderful recipes for cooking using the stovetop or oven, my search continues for a slow-cooker/crockery book that delivers recipes for delicious (or even ""make this again"") meals."
2,less than impressed,"I bought this book due to the good reviews it got. I like gourmet food with a lot of flavor and this book just didn't deliver. I was excited to see the variety of recipes, but when I tried them I was disappointed. The curry recipe, for example, was very bland, I've had better luck adapting my regular recipes."
1,Biggest Book of Slow Cooker Recipes (Better Homes & Gardens),"This book is definitely not for the UK market. Quite a few of the ingredients mentioned were ""foreign"" to me such as Navy Beans. In addition, I feel that other ingredients could only be purchased from US Supermarkets.I was also surprised that none of the recipes suggested browning the meat content prior to placing it in the Slow Cooker.All in all,the brief recipe booklet which came with the Tefal 3-in-1 cooker has given me a better insight into how to get the best out of this appliance.RegardsJulia Milne"
1,what not to buy,"I have ""nearly"" a small library of cook books as an aficionado of ""always looking to something different"" in cuisine. I bought this book with great expectations considering ""just it's size""! The let down was bigsize also.I did not return it. I donated it to the Salvation Army. Maybe someone who has never owned one can use it. For me? It was a total waste ofmoney on something that had absolutely NOTHING new, nor relevant, nor even enticing that could live up to it's hype. Shame of B.H.&Gardens; for the deception of applying a popourri of slapstick food combinations to make $$. Out of some 400 pages I found only 10 that had ""some"" appeal.Slow cooker dressing that takes 4-1/2 hours to make? And then what? Another 8 hrs for the turkey? I'll have to rent a hotel for my guests."
2,Not So Good,"When I loked at the book, I found the recipes to be decidedly unappealing. I was looking for a book that would give me insight into the versatility of the hot pot, and provide techniques for maximizing the possibilities. This is not the book!"
2,Not Impressed!,I have made 2 recipes from the cookbook and both lacked flavor. I'm about to give birth to our first child and thought using a crock pot would make it easier for me. I'm going to continue the search for a good crock pot cookbok.
3,Translating job in Japan,"I avoid Brits for job, but shopping lots of books on the difference between Yanks and Brits. This book may be helpfulfor me too. Still I am not confident of understandingwhat Brits write and speak well. Less books in Japanintroducing the difference in English. Reading these kindsof books is interesting. Gradually Brits do not seem tobe aliens, a cause to fail in translation/interpretation."
1,They should outlaw test-bombing,"This movie was a total bomb; it was a failure in all cinematic categories. All the major players from the first movie save one (Jill Eikenberry who played Susan) return to star in this one, but whatever they did wasn't enough to save the picture. Sometimes, the best things you do are the things you don't do; this film is a prime example of that situation."
1,Dead mean tell no tales,"... or so we're told. A pity this is the exception to the rule.All the elements that made the original Arthur great, especially the one-liners, the cinematic flow and feel of the movie, Arthur's irrepressible personality, and the naturalness of the absurdity, are all disposed.The replacement is a series of hackneyed scenes, strung together in a formulaic and unbelievable setting. It suggests a film held hostage to its executive producer - the same Moore that was genius in the first movie - attempting to shoehorn a reality play and forced character development into an environment that was so charming due to its lack of either.Three thumbs down if that is possible."
2,Frank,I was very disappointed in this film. It doesn'tcompare at all to the Original Arthur Movie. Iwould prefer to watch the original many times!I cannot recommend this film.
4,What is I.O.L.?,"I've seen this movie at least three times by now. I can see why some may say they didn't like this movie. But I'll have to disagree with them. I thought Arthur: On The Rocks was actually very good, especially that scene on the stairs with the incredibly old apartment super and the slow-moving, electric chair. Very funny! The comedy in Arthur 2 reminds me a lot of the classic movies from the 30s and 40s that I like so much. If it had been made back in the 30s or 40s, I would think David Niven and Ginger Rogers would've been perfect for the lead roles and probably would've won Oscars for them. So to the sequel-phobic people out there, I say give Arthur 2 one more chance. Not only will you find out what I.O.L. is but you might like it the second time around."
5,Arthur 2 is dynamite,The movie is excellent and makes me miss Dudley Moore all the more. The interaction between all actors always makes me laugh and it really entertained me. I love the sparring with Liza and Dudley.
3,"Cute, but old news","The original ""Arthur"" is a classic, but this sequel is not as iconic. Arthur 2 is cute, but not all that fuffy. Even Dudley Moore, drunk acting was too staged and us inspired. Overall, I'd recommend it if you liked the first installment, but don't expect to much."
2,A mistake,"This was a movie that should not have been made. Arthur's behavior in the first flick was amusing. Here it becomes increasingly tiresome, and you begin to question his wife's sanity at putting up with it. The cast tries (Liza looks great), and it's lushly produced, but they should have better left alone. Gielgud is wasted, although he does get the film's best line."
2,Why did this film have to be done?,"Why, oh why did this film have to be done? It is not at all funny and touching at all. The only appearance that was worthwhile in this film was of John Gielgud as Arthur's butler, as an angel. This was not even worth it. They should just have left it where it was at the end of the first movie. Let's face it. That Gordon guy could have made a lot of good films, had he been alive. I could see a lot of excellent films just like Arthur. But when Gordon died, Arthur did too. It seems that the only reason this film was made was to try to reap the profits that the first one made. This film is not worth it in any way (Except for John Gielgud). Don't watch it, unless you are really bored one day."
3,More like a research project than a story,"While I can appreciate the level of research that Tallis must have done, he seems to have gotten carried away with it. For example, I didn't need to know that a shopper can get items at half price in one part of Vienna vs. another. This information contributed nothing to the story. I have been to Vienna, and he did capture the monuments, etc. very well. But ultimately, I read a novel for the story and characters, and I wish he had focused more on them."
4,Enjoyable Mystery in a different light,"I find that I read this book again and again. Mary Sage Elliot is no Nancy Drew. She has real problems that she would rather hide from, just like so many of us. During the first reading I had no idea who the killer was until the very end although in later readings I see the clues were there all of the time."
2,could be better,"i see that many reviewers like this band and this album. i am not one of them. i thought the songs all sounded the same. the songs were weak and unoriginal. there is music that you listen to and instantly i am up alive and kicking. the music just hits you and wakes you up from inside out. this is NOT BTS. there are bands that you listen to and maybe you dont like them, first time around but you dont not like them either. they grow on you listen after listen. this COULD BE BTS but it is not.the songs are weak, badly written and mundane. there is nothing original or unique here. im sorry kids, but i see many of you like this band buy BTS are not the greatest band in amercia right now. (there is no greatest band. any band i give, someone will always argue that ___ is better) there is nothing of substance to move me either musically or lyrically.my take is to seek greener pastures elsewhere."
3,Glossed-Over Spill?,"This album is a dissapointment mostly based on the fact that is has been preened, plucked and prettified until there's not too much solid material left. The vocals are as great as they've always been, but the sound of this CD is remniscient of something you'd find on a cheesy pop emo compilation. (REAL cheesy). Built to Spill has shed it's previous gritty, less studio-doctored feel for a shiny new face and this change is not for the better. However, worth noting, the first track ""Strange"" does not feature candied guitar-synths and is pretty damn good."
3,Give this album time to sink in,"I was very let down when I first heard this disc. It certainly didn't meet my expectations. PFNO is near perfect for long-form BTS jams. KILAS repackaged the layered guitar sound to short, pop perfection. But AMOTF doesn't seem like it improved upon either of these albums. Its sound can be described as falling between the two albums.Over time, though, the songs have really grown on me. Its not a perfect disc, and its not their best, but it is BTS and it is worth a listen. Their next album will really determine the course of the band and illustrate if they are on a downward spiral."
4,It's a shame...,"... that people review this after 1 or 2 listens. The melodies on this album are great - very distilled from normal BTS - but great. The flying guitars are not present here, and as such, it lacks what I used to think was that essential BTS-ness. But the songs do make you want to hum along. Treat it like a B-sides album. A very good one."
2,More of the same but less of the ROCK!,"On this release we see more of the same Built To Spill but with less of what we have come to love...quirky song writing and rad guitar work. Don't get me wrong this is a decent album, but it is not up to par with past releases. The album is saved, by STELLAR guest appearances by Quasi's San Coomes."
4,Built To Spill Have Done It Again,"Incredible! One thing everyone can agree on when listening to Built to Spill, is the fact that they are different. Poppy...yet technical. Although this album does not come close to their previous albums, (specifically ""There's Nothing Wrong With Love"" and ""Keep It Like A Secret""), it does make quite an impression. I can't really articulate the sheer joy of listening to some of these songs. They touch you on so many emotional levels. So in that sense it is everything we have come to expect from this great band. I know most fans of BTS aren't going to rely on some stupid review like mine to determine wheter to purchase this album. Because they know, as I know, this band can do no wrong. I think this album is kind of a mix between ""Perfect From Now On"" and ""KILAS"", meaning that the songs are short and catchy yet there is still something epic about them...Well I don't know if that made any sense but in any case, this album is great. Ok."
2,no.,"Sorry, but... no. Built to Spill have put out several fantastic CD's... in fact, up till now, all their CD's have been pretty much fantastic. However, listening to this, you'd never know. I'm at a loss as to exactly what to say- it's just plain bad. Boring, even. Please don't buy it. Please? It'll only encourage them to create more of the same. Someone needs to tell them this is just not the quality they're capable of- NOWHERE NEAR the quality of this band, this band that might just be the best band in the world in their finer moments."
4,New BTS!,"Ancient Melodies of the Future is definitely Built To Spill. Doug's voice and guitar stylings are still the same. AMOTF didn't reach out and grab me like some of their past albums, but BTS fans definitely need to complete their BTS collection with this release.I'd say Ancient Melodies of the Future is a cross between Perfect From Now On and some of their B sides from The Normal Years. They don't seem to take too many chances on this one, but then again, I haven't been able to spend much time with it yet.If you already dig Built To Spill, you'll enjoy Ancient Melodies of the Future. If you don't know much about them, I recommend you buy all of their albums in order of their releases."
5,"7 years later, and still amazing","I've never considered myself a big Built to Spill fan, but this record...WOW. I bought it 7 years ago, and today (July of 2008) I find myself listening to it several times a week. It's one of those ""onion"" type albums, that every time you think you've gotten the hang of it, you'll peel back another layer and find yet more substance and beauty waiting for you."
3,"get ""keep it like a secret"" instead","This album is pleasing and fun, but won't necessarily knock your socks off. For those who are new to BTS, a better place to begin is ""Keep it Like a Secret,"" which has a lot more personality."
4,"Great, and different, hits compilation","Great White is a great band. They can rock, roll and play the blues and ballads with the best of them. This CD is a nice, and different, hits compilation. Slow Ride is an awesome song and I don't know why it hasn't been released on other ""hits"" CDs.I do agree that the sound of this CD is not perfect but the version I recieved isn't what I would consider poor."
1,Piece of Junk,"Very loud. Jams easily. Vibrates right off the counter. Fortunately, it broke within the year so I can buy a different blender."
2,Not quite as easy as suggested.,This book falls far short of its promise to teach you to write chinese charcters. It starts off fine then it all runs together and when your done you neither have the motivation or skill to write and understand chinese characters.
2,I've read better.,The book should have had more pictures.The author should have spent more time on the explination of writing. The authors seems to be narcissitic.
5,Start with this book.,"This book teaches the principles of sound and beautiful writing - the names of the strokes, the order in which they are written, aesthetic principles, and the common radicals. Then it provides a famous poem to practice with, and a list of a hundred common characters, sorted by frequency of usage. When the simplified character differs from the traditional, both are given. Transliterations are in pin-yin. This is far and away the best book I've found for learning to write the characters. I regretted the transition away from this book to other resources, principally because other resources usually use the printed form that ignores the aesthetic principles and turns beauty into ugliness. That sounds harsh, doesn't it? But it's true! If you're going to learn to write, start with this book, so you won't have to go back later to correct bad habits."
4,Like camera but caution Memorex DVD-RW not working.,"I have only used this Sony Handycam DCR-DVD301 for 3 discs. One Sony DVD-RW disc and two Memorex DVD-RW. The Sony disc still works but the two Memorex disc have failed - they each get ""format error"". The Memorex discs recorded OK and played back on the handycam until I finalized the discs. They will now not play on the handycam or the DVD player. The Memorex disc package states that it may be used in Sony camcorders. I rated this camera a 4 based on it working with the Sony discs but would rate it lower if it will only work with Sony discs. I like the handycam based on the use with the Sony discs."
3,"Computer Savy, stay away!","I bought this camcorder (300 model) because I was having a horrible time converting my DVs into DVDs, mainly because of limitations on my computer.I am disappointed. It comes with USB2.0, no firewire. And to make matter worse, the bundled software (very poor quality) uses some legacy systems (or win socks?) to recognise it. No other software on my system (incluing Nero) can use it as video capture device. So you are stuck with what Sony deems fit for you.However, if you just like to get the DVDs from you camcorder and play it on your DVD player, you are OK. Please keep in mind that you may end up buying lots of DVD-R, because many DVD players still don't accept Sony's format of DVD-RW. Not to mention that DVD-R are still around $7 each."
2,Too many error messages,"I use this camera for training purposes. I need every recording to come out perfectly so that I amy critique the participants. The camera does everything it says it will do but it does not read discs well. Last week, of 3 participants in the room, the recordings failed twice. Bah, humbug Sony! I can't afford to lose a recording when my clients are paying for the training.I'm looking for another camera."
1,"No Ma'am, That's Not History","My only comment is to read Hugh Nibley's ""No Ma'am, That's Not History."" This will answer any questions about the remarks in Brodie's book"
1,Totally biased and false,"This book was written, using anti-Mormon documents as sources for the propoganda. Ms. Brodie was not writing this book as a true informative study of the LDS church. She was writing this as a way to spread intolerance. This book may be a convenient way for people to disprove Joseph Smith and the LDS church, but it is completely ignorant of the facts.Honestly, would you want to trust someone who started writing a book convinced that she was going to find out that the church isn't true and that Joseph Smith was a liar? Why would she even want to ""research""? She already knew what she wanted to find, so she was basically wasting her time.This book is definitely one to AVOID!"
1,True But Yet False,"This book clearly shows who Mr. Smith was. Mr. Smith was merely a con artist and like a good con artist he was able to convince others to follow him. Unlike, as other have point out in the reviews; he is nothing close to a profit or a preacher. Yes, he was human, but he chose to manipulate others in his ""quest"" to be perfect. The fact that he was human clearly says that he was never perfect and now that he has died shows that he will never be perfect in any stretch of the imagination. I have read book upon books about the Mormon cult (both for and against) and this is not a book that I would recommend to someone. I would especially not recommend this book to someone who would like to be apart of the cult as it is more one sided. A great book to read would be The Kingdom of the Cults By Walter Martin. Not only does this book tell the complete store of Smith but it also tells the changing history of the Mormons."
5,This will stay with you,I picked up No Man Knows My History because I like Fawn Brodie's work. It's not an attack on Mormonism. It's not an attack on Joseph Smith. If anything I was struck by the sympathetic portrayal of Smith and his followers. Fawn Brodie doesn't appear to enjoy writing unsavory things about her subject. I'd say the book is a fair and accurate one. The writing is so enjoyable. Brodie wrote nonfiction with a fiction author's flair. I picked it up at nine in the morning and kept coming back to it until I'd finnished it at around midnight.
5,Well-written and Researched--Read and Decide for Yourself.,"Without question, Fawn Brodie has produced a masterwork of religious history with this volume. I have been passionately interested in Latter-day Saint history and theology for several years, and feel it would be improper to formulate an opinion of Joseph Smith without consulting this work. Her conclusions will, of course, be attacked by members of the Latter-day Saint faith, but I would hope you would read it and form your own opinion.It's well-written, using a style that is both authoritative and approachable, well-paced and well-thought out. Please don't number me as an opponent of the Saints; I simply investigated their theology as part of a personal quest and found difficulties with it. Certainly, you should read more than one work dealing with subject, and make up your mind accordingly.Make sure, however, that this is a cornerstone of your search-I believe you will find it well worth your efforts."
4,A NON-SENSATIONALIST LOOK AT JOSEPH SMITH,"I FELT THIS BOOK TO BE A GOOD READ ALTHOUGH LESS SCANDALOUS THAN I THOUGHT IT WAS GOING TO BE. SHE DID NOT REALLY EXPLAIN WELL WHY THE MORMONS WERE SO HATED IN MISSOURI. IT IS BECAUSE THEY WERE THIEVING GENTILE PROPERTY AND THIS WAS NOT FULLY DEVELOPED IN HER NARRATIVE. ALSO , AND THIS IS A COMMON COMPLAINT, SHE TRIES TO GUESS AT HIS MOTIVES. A VERY DIFFICULT TASK INDEED. SHE IS NO PSYCHIATRIST YET SHE THEORISES ABOUT HIS BRAIN QUITE A LOT. I WOULD HAVE LIKED HER TO EXPLAIN IN THE BOOK WHY SHE DID NOT CONSIDER THE REPORTS OF HIS TIME IN AN INSANE INSTITUTION WORTH MENTIONING IN THE MAIN BODY OF HER WORK. HER POLITICS ALSO SEEPS INTO THE PAGES. DESPITE THESE CRITICISMS, IT IS OVERALL A VERY GOOD BOOK AND I RECOMMEND IT AS BASIC TO ANYONE CONSIDERING BECOMING A MORMON."
4,Better than I had been told,"I had always been under the assumption that this was a mean-spirited book about Joseph Smith. I was surprised to find that it wasn't. Obviously Brodie doesn't believe that Smith was a prophet, so this book is written from that perspective. But I found that she was very simpathetic and offered some interesting insight into his life. I came out respecting Smith for who he was and what he accomplished, regardless of whether I believed his claim or not."
5,Spellbinding and Beautifully Researched,"Mrs. Brodie, a highly respected historian, has written what must still be the definitive book on this charismatic and controversial American figure. Since she was raised a Mormon and had access to documents that the Church normally forbids to outsiders, she is able to separate out aspects of the ""official"" biographies of Smith from the realities of his life and times. I was struck by how admiring, in many ways, she is of him: unlike the Church's view, which paints him as completely unlearned (thereby strengthening the argument that the Book of Mormon had to be the word of God), she celebrates his energetic inventiveness, the facility with words and ideas that might have made him a novelist had he had a more conventional education. She also has meticulously researched the trends and climate of the times which inform practically every word of the Book of Mormon. A fair and admirable piece of history writing."
5,"Wonderfully written, thoroughly researched","Outstanding book, and one that's caused a fair bit of consternation among the Mormon faithful. I'd take their criticisms with a grain of salt."
3,The first intellectual biography of the latter-day prophet,"At the time of its release, Brodies work was either either a masterpiece or muckraking depending upon the vested interest one brought to the review. Time has not been kind to all of the books details or to the methods of psychological inquiry used by Brodie. Indeed Smith has proven to be far too complex a character for the biographer. Still if one is to engage in a serious study of early Mormonism or the life of America's prophet, Brodie is a foundation work if for no other reason than to set the parameters for what follows. The life of Joseph may never fully be realized in print and Donna Hill's work is actually much closer to reviving the man than is Brodies'. Still this work will hold its place in Mormon history for no other reason than that it motivated many others of all religous persuasions and scholastic ability to look seriously at the latter-day movement and attempt to explain its significance."
4,Joseph Smith Prophet? Seerer? Revelator?,"To be certain I had a balanced picture of Joseph Smith, undoubtedly an American original, I bought and read a short biography sold by Deseret Press. In the 160 pages, there was so little substance for so historical figure, I caught myself thinking ""get on with it"".That didn't happen. So, back to Fawn Brodie. Her volume gave me at least, starting places to research. This did not happen in the Deseret volume. Although Brodie could be accused of being biased, I believe she let the historical evidence take her where it would."
2,Brodies unique psychobiographical methodology,"Brodie fails to find Smith for the same reasons she fails to find other historical figures of whom she has written, and that is because she writes her conclusions first, and then marshalls her materials to find her way back to them.Many eminent scholars and biographers have found fault with Brodie's methodology.The shame is that sh eis capable of a high standard of work, but in Smith's case, as in others, she fails dismally to live up to her promises and abilities.As one reviewer, above, has written, she did dispose of the Spaulding Theory as the origin of the Book of Mormon, but then makes a partial retraction by saying that she could not rule it out.She makes significant contributions to the understanding of Smith and his times, but must be faulted by her determined efforts to justify her personal conclusions of him.Smith deserves better, and Brodie could do better."
1,"Why this thing pretends to be called ""history""?","Anybody can have and/or share whatever he/she wants. If I find someone's opinion unpleasant - I can't complain. This is called ""freedom."" However, this book is mainly a chain of ""must-have-felt's"" and ""deep-inside's"" guesses -- which would suit better a book of fiction. Why calling it ""history""? By any means, it is not. If things presented in it are ""honest"" and ""factual"", then my intestines can be called ""candy factory""."
1,Full of errors,"This book has been around for a long time because people who do not know the facts are deceived by it. This book takes quotes out of context, mixes them with pieces of other quotes, then tries to make the reader believe they were said in connection with each other. Many dates are wrong. The author reads into an event her own explanation and then says that is the only reason that event occured. Truth is totally obscured in this book. A waste of time and money. A ""friend"" loaned a copy to me and now I'm glad because I could then see what a piece of junk it is."
1,"No Ma'am, That Ain't History!","The so-called facts in this book have been debunked by Hugh Nibley's book, ""No Ma'am, That Ain't History."""
1,Blind and biased,"Before buying be aware that this book was written by a pro Mormon and that the majority of the available information was ignored by Ms. Brodie as the sources available were mostly ""biased"" in her opinion. ""Biased"" in the author's opinion was testimony which was either critical of Mr. Smith or originated from a non-Mormon, or was/is usual, both. I know of no real biography that is balanced, but quite honestly, balanced views of Jo Smith ARE negative, a definite problem for the ""balanced"" view."
1,A lie that is still in print,"This book is a cheap reconstruction of old anti-mormon beliefs of the past. In this book Brodie takes accounts that fit her intent to show that the Prophet Joseph Smith is a false prophet who means well. She uses accounts from people who are not reliable in there stories and who from the beginning didnt like the prophet. This is just another person trying to jump on the band wagon of anti-mormon books who likes to use lies to prove there point. Its time to get a life people and not continue trying to look for things that are not true to prove your point. You want to know the real history of the prophet Joseph Smith ask a missionary from the LDS church. Dont go to a Ford dealerhip to get information on a Chevy you'll get Ford's side of the story not Chevy's. Let think logical. Another book that you should read is ""Tinkling Cymbals and Sounding Brass"" by Hugh Nibley"
1,This book is ridiculous,"The autor clearly is a poor writer of history, she actually claims to know what the charactors are thinking. Very little research finds her sources unreliable to say the least.I also read Brodie's book on Thomas Jefferson and her same absurd way of writing is also in this book.Its not history, though entertaining to read.If you want an amusing ""fiction"" books on Smith or Jefferson go ahead, if you really want history there are plenty of better books available."
1,Fawn Brodie Distorts History,"Fawn Brodie is a woman who researched her subject carefully and then, and this can be proven, created her own make-believe sources and quoted them. She took actual events and then twisted them ever so slightly to add a negative bent to the event. How do I know this - I have spent the last two years in extensive research of Joseph Smith, Jr. I read dozens of books, diaries, letters and journals. Fawn Brodie's was by far, the worst one I read because she took a personal agenda and applied it to an historic subject. She should have stuck to the truth, not created quotes and sources, then she may have had a real book on Joseph Smith, Jr."
1,very biased opinion driven taken out of context history,The author has a clear opinion about joseph smith. She seems to be trying to prove him to be a fruad from the beginning instead of being a true scholarly historian and simply examining the facts. Instead of a history you get an opinion.
5,life of Joseph Smith,"This is a must read. It shows what someone with a great but warped imagination, charisma can accomplish with some theatrics. On the already established credibility of Christianity, this guy invented his own religion out of thin air."
2,It seems scholarly but it has its problems,"When Fawn Brodies book was first published it appeared to finally be a scholarly work on the prophet Joseph Smith. Although she did discredited some of the stories sensational stories about Joseph Smith, her book suffers from two major flaws.1. She tends to ignore information and resources that don't support her preconceived ideas.2. The book reads more like a novel than a true history. She knows more about what Joseph is thinking than any biographer can know. This criticism was dismissed by her supporters, but when she used the same technique on a biography of Thomas Jefferson, then those who knew better were strong in their denunciation of her work"
4,Truth disguised with passion,"As an ex-mormon I feel this book has many claims that are true and many that are most likely not based in fact. It is a decent account of the man. Hugh Nibley's Tinkling Cymbals and Sounding Brass does not deal handily with the issue however as mentioned above. Dr. Nibley ignores many of the issues Ms. Brodie brings up, he only negates the few that he can (and we know there are a few misinformations). This is a good starting point and a required reading for anyone planning on joing the Mormon church, I wish I would have.,"
3,Religion v/s con artist,"I have not finished reading yet but,it is an interesting 'read'..The author has done much research and appears to know & understand the 'subject matter'. I'm sorry, I find it difficult to BELIEVE so many people would fall for his 'gosple' and accept it as truth."
4,Joseph Smith: World's Greatest Salesman :),"This is a pretty good book. No, the author does not ""slam"" Joseph, as many Mormons who review this book seem to imply. Sometimes she tries to explain how she thinks Joesph may have been thinking, and/or his motives for certain things he says or does. This is quite helpful, because she is very well-aquainted with his life, being able to use her knowledge to help us understand him. I enjoyed this book quite well. Only thing I don't like is the ""older"" style of writing, but the book was written in the 1940's, so what do you expect? Great reading!-Bill Smith"
4,A Book That Can Produce Unexpected Conclusions,"I read Fawn Brodie's well written biography of Joseph Smith when I was a proud independent thinking agnostic. I gobbled up the book in two sittings (again it's very nicely written) and I was fascinated by Fawn Brodie's revelations of Joseph Smith as a confidence man and generally lovable rogue whose schemes succeeded beyond his wildest dreams.Also, her theory that freemason ritual provided the basis for Mormon Temple ceremonies is particularly interesting.However, after carefully pondering the book, I reached the conclusion that, for whatever reason, God had raised a Prophet on the New York frontier. After struggling with this belief for a few years, I finally joined the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints. I'm very glad I did. Today, as I've learned more about him, I easily acknowledge Joseph Smith as a Prophet, Seer, and Revelator.Who knows? Sometimes the message is conveyed in mysterious ways."
1,"save your money, inaccurate mind reading by author","When this author somehow supplies what Joseph Smith ""must have been thinking"" and puts together a senario from that, as to why things happened instead of looking at what he and others said is the reason, then readers should take care. If you have read other non prejudiced books then you will be able to see the distortions here. If anybody REALLY wants to know facts, get The Encyclopedia of Mormonism by McMillian, it is only four volumes and was not put out by the LDS (they took a year to review it before they endorsed it!) though many LDS were asked to submit articles (only makes sense if it is about them) there is even a whole subject on Anti-LDS of over several pages which gi ves titles of Anti-LDS books and authors!"
1,Can one give less than one star?,"How tiresome. If I were looking into Xerox, I wouldn't read reports on Xerox written by Ricoh, or even worse, a ""former"" Xerox employee. This book truly is a waste of time for anoyone looking into Mormonism or the life of Joseph Smith with an objective perspective. If you are an anti-Mormon, then have at it, but remember that none of the references withstand empirical investigation. They are all based on hearsay and fabricated documents that reference themselves.If you want to be objective, then be honest in your research and study the subject itself or the actual writings, not those of a biased source.Don't waste your time with this tripe."
1,"This touted ""Objetive"" work is a forum for a personal agenda","This oft quoted work is supposedly the model of objective research regarding Joseph Smith and the foundations of Mormonism. Brodie has been able to dig up some little known and little talked about events to be sure, but she places primary importance on these facts and pieces them together in a fashion that exposes a pretty strong personal agenda. Brodie is a master at brushing by events that do not support her agena. Much more than her poor presentation of facts, I am concerned that Brodie seems to ""know"" what Smith and others were thinking when the events unfolded. Most of her conclusions could be argued if not absolutely proven false. If you are looking for the truth about Mormonism, there are much better books out from both Mormon and Non-Mormon sources."
1,Unsubstantiated drivel,"This no biography, although Brodie would like you to think it is. She's simply a disgruntled ex-mormon who has an axe to grind. Many scholars have discredited her work. Read ""No Ma'am, That's Not History"" - ISBN 6097301243 (author Hugh Nibley) for example."
1,No M'am that's not history,"I am amazed that this book is still being sold and getting positive reviews. I spent two years researching the claims of this books and discovered that the woman is just a bald faced liar. She quotes out of context, to give a totally opposite meaning, and just plain makes up stuff. Brodie was a disaffected Mormon with a grudge. She also did some hatchet jobs on some of our nations' founding fathers. She presumes to read Joseph Smith's mind, omits important information, distorts and abuses the facts. A couple of little books written in rebuttle have been No Ma'am That's Not History, by Hugh Nibley, and Exploding the Myth about Joseph Smith, the Mormon Prophet, by F.L.Stewart. A fair book about Joseph Smith I would reccommend is Joseph Smith, an American Prophet by John Henry Evans (a non-Mormon) or the The History of Joseph Smith by his mother, Lucy Mack Smith. Don't waste your money on Brodie, unless you like sensationalized historical fiction."
5,Good Old Rock And Roll,"This music is a vanishing breed. Funny, melodic, swinging Rock and Roll! Plus a great cover of ""Dancing Queen"" to boot!"
3,Fear Not the Obvious,"It took a long time to get this. Therefore, I won't be ordering from this vender again, but am satisfied with the cd."
1,Cookie Cutter,"I would've given it zero stars if it were possible. I felt nothing for the characters. I simply didn't care about them one way or the other. The way women were portrayed was disgusting. Every typical, cookie cutter, gag for a teen sex comedy was used, so much so that I found this movie boring. A total waste of money."
2,Decent...,"This was a decent little movie. It was very low budget, but like an early reviewer said it doesn't feel like it after you continue to watch it. I almost turned it off in the first 15 minutes of the movie, but decided to stick it out. The storyline of the two bullies of the Frat picking on the smaller pledger had me hooked and I wanted to see the bullies get theirs.There are some some actors many will recognized in this movie (Sherminator for one) who all did a good job. The rest of the cast was pretty bad. I took this as just like one of those USA ""Up All Night"" movies. Its a ""American Pie/Animal House"" wannabee.Too much gross humor for me. Those are cheap laughs. I am starting to get tired of them and I everytime I see these movies I understand why the youth of America today doesn't truly know what funny is. Its sad. Have guys do their thing on a cookie and the last man to ""pop"" eat it is on NOT, I REPEAT NOT FUNNY. ITS GROSS."
2,interesing!,"One thing's for sure:GOING GREEK will never be shown in the fraternal society.Few Frat guys may ask why this movie is called GOING GREEK, but few may even ask if it is even neccessary to transform these teens from Avrg. teenagers into frat guys.Final thougts:I am advising college teens NOT towatch this for a study of live in fraternity.Or for un.It's just Boring.Boring Boring boring Boring."
1,Same as everything else,The jokes are lame and not funny. It brings scat humor to a new level. (...)
4,Funniest elevator scene ever!,"This frat comedy surprisingly has a lot of heart going for it, but besides that it's pretty damn funny. A really appealing cast completely engages the audience and much of the script and direction, oddly enough, has the ring of personal experience to it. And for outrageous laughs, the elevator scene alone is worth it: once seen, it can never be forgotten. But the real trick here is characters you actually care about--without that, the laughs would be empty."
2,Rusted,"I wanted to love these and I did at first, but, sadly they started rusting badly soon after we got them."
1,Infuriating device is a huge hassle,You have to get on your knees and enter in a plethora of information every time you want to check your body fat--it is incapable of storing even 1k worth of data.
3,Sent the wrong modle,They sent me the cheaper modle so if you order this scale make sure they don't cheat you too.
5,Great Product,Fantastic product. It makes a great night light to see the dash and console trays containing items. I wish I had found this item years ago.
4,Nice light but possibly overpriced,"These give off a pretty nice light but I was thinking they would be more noticably blue or at least really white. They are a bit pricier than other bulbs so I don't know if I'd buy them again. But, they still light up the road well so I can't complain too much."
4,Not cool blue But Super white,Great Lights But they are NOT Cool blue more like a Super bright white but i prefer them over the stock ones! Package took 3 day to get to my footsteps.
5,good lights,the lights have subtle blue color and dont look tacky.the only problem is that I think sylvania is not makeing them anymore. but im not positive on that. overall they look great
5,Excellent book with useful methods,This book contains a lot of useful techniques and excellent strategies for different type of clients. I am already using some of the methods from this book in my sessions with great success.
5,"Great Look, Great Sound, Great Price!","I've had this guitar for over a month now and I absolutely love it! For starters, it is a great looking instrument. And then you play it....And it has an absolutely beautiful sound. I am more than satisfied with this purchase! Not to mention that it is less than $200. It's practically a steal for that price."
2,"Not brilliant, approaching decent","This is a very rudimentary guitar. I had to return the first one because the tuning pegs kept falling out of the guitar, or wouldn't stick in well enough to keep the strings from popping constantly. The return was accepted and another one sent, and the second one also has the problem of the pegs not gripping and holding the strings in the bridge. I have had to rig them up in various ways to make them hold the strings in - thus string changes are frustrating, which are enough to worry about with a 12 string. And to beat the band I restrung my new guitar and now the string action has become high as the neck has begun to bend outward. I'm using light gauge strings - not heavy. I don't agree with the reviewers that say this guitar is well made. It might do the trick if you want a first 12 string, but it's the first guitar I'm not entirely happy having bought. It just screams of ""cheap, cheap, cheap""."
2,Disappointed with new voices,"We just purchased this item and when we got home and loaded it up, was very disappointed in the new voice they're using for Bob, Lofty and Spud! The video itself is great and they've introduced a new off-road 4x4 machine. But honestly, it just doesn't seem like a Bob the Builder without the main voices we're all used to."
2,not happy with new voices,"My son is 2 1/2 years old and he loves Bob, so when I put the dvd on he was really happy to watch.But after a little while I noticed he was not paying attencion as he usually does and then I noticed Bob's voice was not the same at all and also Scoop's voice.The story is really cute and I also like the new character Scrambler. Maybe he will get use to the new voice, but to me is just no the same Bob we are use to."
2,Too much change in new series!,"We just could not get over the drastic changes in the voices. Bob, Spud, Lofty, & Mr. Bentley all had different voices than the original series and movies. Bob & Spud were especially difficult to listen to. This movie did not hold my children's attention the way the other Bob the Builder movies have. I'm sure it's because of the voices. The environmental message was a bit overdone, but we could even tolerate that if the voices weren't so different! I would NOT rebuy this movie knowing what I know now. We should have borrowed it from the library instead."
1,Bob's Plan is to go PC in a big way,"First off, the voices of Bob and most/all the rest are different. Spud is British-- Farmer Pickles imports scarecrows?Bob is an anti-development, tie-dye wearing environmentalist. Instead of showing the positive and negatives of large developments in Sunflower Valley, developers are shown as bad guys. Bob has a nightmare, complete with menacing music, as big buildings grow from the ground everywhere, obliterating the idyllic valley.I love nature, and am for careful planning, but this is way over the top. And while reclycling is good, chanting ""Reduce Recycle Reuse"" cultishly is a bit too much for me. Overall this is really pretty heavy-handed politics for a kids show, and the producers should be ashamed."
2,Bobs american Plan,I did not like this version as the caracters had american accents.No offence to the american accent or Americans but after a year or more in an english accent it is hard to enjoy it being changed. Even my 2 and 3 year old do not like it. They just walk off and ask for Bob the builder even when this one is showing.Perhaps the discs need to mention that it has an american accents for the characters.
3,"A ""must own"" movie for Texans","If you're Texan, you have to own a copy of Fandango, just as you MUST own a copy of the Alamo and The Searchers. A coming of age road trip buddy flick set near the end of the War in Vietnam, the movie was filmed largely on location in West Texas and many sites are recognizable. This is easily Kevin Costner's best film, perhaps because he made it before he became occupied with being Kevin Costner. A trivia note on the film. One scene has the group visiting the site near Marfa where parts of Giant were filmed. The facade of the Giant mansion was a local landmark. A set of a burned out cantina used in Fandango is now a local landmark. It can be seen on the south side of IH-10 near Toyah, TX."
3,Fandango,A cool movie about friends who take one last road trip together after college and before going off to vietnam.
4,What a Fandango,"I love this movie....I had watched it a few years ago & thoughtIt was really cool,but the best thing about it I got to go to someof the movie sites, Chata Ortega's was sad kind of like in the movie, butthe wife and I walked thru it (carefully) and I got some cool pictures,didnot attempt the remains of the flight school since a security guard in atruck was driving over to see what we were doing so we took picture fromthe fence & he drove on by....Great memories & a great movie........"
5,Great Movie,This is a great movie. I loved the great west Texas scenery. Kevin Costner and Jud Nelson were great. Its a good buddy movie that takes place during the latter part of the Vietnam era. I give it 5 stars.
5,Love this - where can I get a version for Europe?,"I keep thinking about this movie and want a copy of it, but I can't seem to get it here in Ireland or a version that will work in video players here. Anyone know where I can get this?A bittersweet tale about the confrontation with reality in the aftermath of youthful passion, in particular as experienced by Judd Nelson's character near the end when he has trouble letting everybody go.Memorable scenes include a terrifying sky-diving sequence and a spontaneously planned, haunting wedding ceremony."
2,Ok but a bit tedious at times,"I don't get the love for this little known pic. I thought it got off to a woefully slow start - in fact, I fell asleep - but then picked up a bit for the big parachute sequence. The hippy dippy pilot is repulsive, but entertaining. Then it bogged down again for the wedding sequence. I saw little to nothing that was comic here. The soundtrack is ok, but the Pat Metheny jazz fusion under the wedding sequence did not fit with the rest of the music which was period rock, and incorrect at that. Actually, Elton John's ""Saturday Night's Alright for Fighting"" came out long after 1971 when this picture is set. Otherwise, there is little to nothing to signify that this was 1971 in the picture. I was disappointed about that."
5,What a great movie!,"Well, all I can say is this is my all time favorite movie!!! It has a little of everything in it, joy & sorrow, comedy & seriousness, and some great scenes that make this movie a one of a kind!!! Over all, is a great movie with some simply beautiful parts in it!!! I LOVE IT!!! PLEASE BUY IT, WATCH IT, KEEP IT!!!!"
5,Favorite Movie,We've had this movie for forever it seems on DVD and I was thrilled to find it on here and for such a great price. I bought it as one of the birthday gifts I got my husband and he watched it right away. It's great that we don't have to go through a lot of work to play that old DVD. I recommend this movie to everyone - it's a family favorite and one we share w/ company.
5,The long quest for Dom,"I'm hoping that my adding a review of this movie is gonna assist in it's DVD release, or at least replay on tv. I haven't seen/heard anything about this movie for ages, but EVERY single time i'm floating around car boot sales/video stands there's my good eye scouting for a copy of Fandango. This movie is inspiring in a word.I've only seen it once, about 8-10 years ago on UK TV, and unfotunately before we had a VCR, so i couldn't record it. I'm still waiting for a PAL version to be released/become available.It's the music that really got me in this film: the flying burrito bros lay superbly beneath the stunning photography of this picture. It's a film that bundles up a whole mixture of emotions and i would have to say has been the groundforce of any road movie i've ever seen.SO, if you get Fandango on tape/dvd/silver screen this year then merry chrimbo to ye. Watch it with all yer mates and get a stir going coz this film needs a second chance..."
5,I do believe in magic,"Well after seeing this film anyway. I remember where I first saw Fandango, I remember the time of day, the weather outside, those other college students there too and where they were exactly in relation to me as I felt my sides split from laughing, I remember how they and I had shifted in our seats as an inexplicable lump in my throat threatened to send me wailing from the room, I remember the glow of magic as the credits rolled, I remember having to re-negotiate my place in the real world again, shocked that I was no longer with those guys on their inspired odyssey, so sure I was there with them, so wanting to be. I am I think, as others will attest, quite the most forgetful of people."
5,Terrific movie,"I love this movie. One of those you can watch again and again and not get tired of it. One of the few times I've enjoyed Kevin Costner in a movie, and Judd Nelson is absolutely hilarious. My VCR is busted....When oh when does it come out on DVD???"
5,Where's the DVD?,This is a great movie that until recently I was made aware of. I can watch it time and time again. The tapes can get worn watching this. So where's the DVD?
4,Fandanged Good,"The first time I saw this movie, I thought it was hilarious. So much so that I didn't expect it to live up to my memory--I was wrong about that. The parachute jump school scenes (and the train-lasso) held up to my memory of them. Funny stuff. The anti-war/political/coming of age components are a bit thin, but as a comedy this one really works for me.Rabbi"
5,Fandango,"It hits my once young heart. To just jump in the car and drive? And what ever comes, comes. Or, throw the dice of life and see what happens.If you were young once (as we all were), and know how you have to let off some steam then you will love this movie.Great characters, great vistas (I moved to West Texas because of the views) and great scenes.The things this movie is missing is a sequel of all involved 20 to 25 years later just to see where all have gone and accomplished or not.My favorite movie of all time.GT"
5,Favorite Coming of Age Movie,"For me this great coming of age tale is about friendship and the value of relationships between men. The underlying theme of personal sacrifice for a friend is what makes the movie so wonderful. Well, that and the hilarious hijinks that go along with any good ""road"" movie. A great blend of sophmoric humor tied in with love of friends as they go on their own life paths. Oh and the music is pretty good too. Why they never released a soundtrack is beyond me. For the curious, the soaring instrumental at the wedding is ""It's for You"" by Pat Metheny.Updated 1/3/07Recommend buying the DVD version. Much better sound quality. STILL one of my top 10 movies of all times."
5,One of my absolute favorites,"If you've ever experienced a classic wild road trip with good buddies, performed a foolish act, or wish you had, you'll find many things to smile about in this film. I've been a huge fan of this flick since '85 and have easily seen it 25 - 30 times since. Have had the pleasure of discussing it briefly with Director Reynolds twice and that insight into his personna has given me even greater respect for what went into the movie. And like Reynolds, I too was a Baylor undergrad and understood the critical need to frequently distance myself from the monotonous trappings of life in boring Waco. It's an entertaining story, as carefree or deep as you want to make it. It did give three of us cause to travel out to the site (whose exact location will remain undisclosed) where Dom was buried, creating our own additional chapter to the tale. Enjoy, it's a nice story."
3,pen refills,"From looking at this product I thought I was getting 3 pen refills not one, the picture is a little misleading."
3,It's Fragil,"The point doesn't have good quality, I used it about a month and then it didn't write more, so i had to change the Ink Refill."
2,Cross Ion Ink Refills are terrible,"I have 2 cross ion pens, which work fine out of the box. I've also tried 12 different refills, and more than half of them stopped working after a few days or don't work at all. I've had the best luck with black (3/4 are good), but the other colors are all very sketchy. Purple doesn't work at all, oranges and reds and green might work if you write slow enough. On the other hand, Cross will replace the refills for free, but it's still a hassle and you'll likely get non-working refills as a replacement too."
1,poor quality refills,My Cross Ion pen worked great but every refill I have purchased so far has failed within a few days to a couple of months (of light use). Some refills have completely dried up and others the ink flow is such that you can only write very slowly. Good pens but unfortunately they are let down by poor quality refills.
1,Love the Pen - Hate the refill,I like blue ink - I've purchased at least 4 dozen blue refills - They dry up before I can use them or they dry up shortly after installation - The pen is a super idea for a blue collar guy - It fits in the pocket of my jeans but they need to solve the ink problem -
3,Slow but Kelly Brook Looks Hot,Like any movie on the sci fi channel this movie is slow. Lambert is his usual professional self playing his part well but this movie gets its 3 stars for the looks of model Kelly Brook.
1,Finally! Someone's made a cure for insomnia!,"A deadly virus kills 5 billion people in the year 2010, and everyone depends on a drug called Absolon to survive.The production design leaves a lot to the imagination. I don't care how low their budget was...they could have made it look better. It looks like they spent half their budget on a special effects shotin the beginning and a 3-D biohazard symbol in the opening credits. They would have been better off spending their money on better sets.The dialogue is full of wimpy clichés, and all of the acting is dry. Sadly, though, the dialogue is slightly less boring than the action scenes.This is the worst movie Christopher Lambert has been in since Highlander 2: The Quickening.I guess if you want to watch a stupid movie just to laugh at, you could go with this one."
3,It works BUT Hard to Install,"I recently purchased thePetSafe Deluxe Pet Panel Panels for Sliding Glass Doors 93-96"" Tall, Medium, Whitefor my dog so she could go in and out on here own. It is a great product but it is quite a project to install. Not easy unless you are really handy. Had to drill into the existing door to install properly...One screw was already stripped when I received it.Dog loves it but be prepared."
2,"doggie door falls short of perfect, but still a nice luxury","The fit isn't ideal as our sliding door is wider than the pet door so the locks couldn't align. When I called customer service hoping they'd have some spacers for what should be a common issue for them, they told me to use a stick in the patio door for security instead. Additionally, the weather stripping for the door just fell off from it's own weight, leaving the glue goop all over the sliding glass door in addition to the wind gushing in through the gaping gap. They are sending new weather stripping so I hope that proves better. Nice company service, but you'd think all these tweaks would be figured out by now. Nonetheless, we have jerry-rigged the doggie door and it offers great luxury for us. Overall a plus, just more frustrating to make work in the beginning."
5,value and economy and safety,"I shopped for paper cutters, believe it or not, for a birthday present for my 12 year old son. He's doing fantastic origami and was asking me to do precision cuts on paper for his projects. I looked at the guillotine cutters, and could see the potential for tragedy. Other cutters with wheels, obviously safer, were really nice but had hefty price tags. So I found this here, on amazon and it looked about right, the size, the nice scales built in all over the surface and the good safe wheel. It is perfect for his purposes, of course. It's sturdy, has rubber feet, clear markings, a good straight edge top and bottom and of course a razor sharp pizza wheel under a protective handle. I have been using it for clipping magazine copy and pictures for collages. It's really slick. I don't even remember what I paid for it, but I am very pleased with this product. Oh, it has optional wheels that cut wavy and pinked lines. I've no use for that, but the scrap book people will love this."
2,Cutter,It works okay but I'm not very happy with it. It doesn't seem to cut very straight. I would spend the extra money and buy a better one.
4,Good Deal,I've had this paper cutter for a few years and use it a few times a month on average. It's not heavy duty for say commercial use but it's a good value for home use.
3,Carl Cutter,"COMES WITH MAT & BLADE!!When I ordered this, the description said that it did not come with a mat or blade, so I ordered them seperately.Cuts great!"
2,You get what you pay for,"The old rule of thumb holds true for this trimmer. It's on the inexpensive side, and deservedly so. The rotary blade mechanism is mounted on a plastic bar that is not held firmly in place, therefore causing varying results.The value you find in this item depends on what you want to do with it. If you want something that cuts things for arts and crafts, and you are not finicky about how straight it is, then this item is for you.If you want to cut photo prints or artwork and require a true straight edge, you will be very disappointed with this item. I also own a Fiskars product which works much better for photos. Dahle makes nice trimmers as well. Both have securely mounted metal bars that the rotary mechanism is mounted to and therefore are much more accurate."
3,I wish it cut better.,"This is a decent product that cuts alright. It is not a professional quality cutter. Unless the user presses very hard, the cutter has a difficult time cutting all the way through high quality photo paper."
2,Not a percise cutter,"If you are looking for a cutter for trimming close to an edge, look for something else.I bought this cutter thinking it is a precise cutter as I need to trim 1/16"" from an edge of cards that I have (business card width).The concept of this cutter is great but when trying to cut so close to the edge the blade moves away from the plastic ruler to the outside of the card ending up in un-even cuts to no cuts at all.I ended up using the plastic ruler/holder to hold down the card and a utility knife to cut the card. Eventually the utility knife will damage the plastic ruler which at that point I will need to throw away the cutter.I didn't give the cutter 1 star because the concept is very good, they just need to prevent the blade from moving to make it a 5 star product."
2,"OK, but not Fantastic","Ok, it does what its supposed to do, but with extreme focus and effort. To ""lock"" your paper into place, you have to push on a piece of flimsy plastic that does not stay down evenly along the paper edge. So, with one hand, you push down in the front, and with the other hand at back with cutter in hand, you push the cutter down to cut and slide forward until your hands meet. It takes a LOT of pressure on the cutter for it to cleanly cut through 1 sheet of photo paper. Also, there are no printed directions on how to use it, except on the item itself. They are pretty minimal.In the end, I find it hard to use, and hard to get accurate straight cuts every time. Accuracy is probably 75%. So, I have to redo 1 of every 4 cuts. If you are doing 2 or 4 photos a time, it can be frustrating. Maybe it gets better with practice, but I'm not a big fan."
4,The Carl Rotary Trimmer at work,"The Carl Rotary Trimmer is a superb product, but it should be accompanied by more than one blade."
3,More realistic book than many others,"I've been in 2 marriages with step-baggage so I have personal experience here. This book was more realistic than others in the feelings a new wife may have, but it really doesn't get into the dirt. I never had bad feelings or jealousy toward my husband's first wife until she barged into our lives and started acting like she was still married to him. In no way should you be, as the author said ""the forgotten toy at the bottom of the toy box"". If you are, then you're doing it all wrong. I've (after much prodding from friends) have decided to write my own thoughts and maybe one day my book will be here. Until then, if you're a new wife and need some consoling that you are not crazy, selfish or alone in your feelings, then by all means read this book. Welcome to the sisterhood."
1,Did not help,This book is like all of the other books. It says be nice and look past everything. I can understand doing that to a certain point. I need a book to help me learn houw to deal with a bi-polar psycho! This woman throws away her children's stuff because my husband I bought the items. She lies to the child Support office about payments then we have to take checks she has signed to court and prove her wrong and she still does not get in trouble for these things. She signs me up for baby formula and magazines non stop. Where is a book to help you with this kind of person?
1,NOt helpful - just ranting,I ordered this book looking for helpful advice. All it gave was endless ranting about how awful being remarried (escpecially with step-children) can be. It left me feeling worse!
4,Good to feel normal!,"The beauty of this book is not in the advice (it has no tips, or practical tools) but in the opportunity it offers the reader to identify with the writer's situation. I am a divorced woman seriously dating a man with an ex-partner and a daugther and always felt ""weird"" due to the emotional reactions I had around certain situations, particularly those that involved his ex. Given that I had little support from family and friends (none are divorced or dating people with ex-es), the book was a welcomed reassurance that my emotions were NORMAL!"
1,waste of time and money,"This book doesn't really even try to offer advice, all it does is summarize the problems and explain how everything can go wrong. The closest is comes to offering advice is to say ""take a deep breath and keep trying."" or ""Ultimately, there's not a lot you can do except see it for what it is."""
3,Ex-Wives and Ex-Lives: Survival Guide for the Next Wife,"Although I generally liked the book, I would have liked to have had more ""solutions"" along with the scenarios Engler introduces."
1,"Somewhat informative, but disappointing","I did not get quite what I was looking for when I purchased this book. Was hoping there would be more information to help me get through and understand some difficult things in dealing with an ex-wife. It did help some, though."
1,Insulting,"I am a second wife and a step mother who continually seeks out books on how to navigate the dark waters of this challenging life choice. What I was searching for was a book that validated how I was feeling and gave me tips / recommendations on how to proceed. Well --The book's message can be summed up as follows: ""Being a second wife and a step mom sucks, and the reality is, your life sucks now, will continue to suck, and you're completely screwed. You're a 'second' wife because in life from this point forward, you will always be second.""I threw the book away and told my step mom's group to not even bother because trash belongs in the trash."
2,Ex wifes and Ex lives,This book is great to tell ex wifes what is coming or what is normal but it does not give steps or suggetions on how to deal with the situation which is what i thought survival guide meant. This did not help me.
4,Cookie Shapes,"This is a toddler friend's FAVORITE book and asks for it at bedtime every night. As a result he quickly learned all shapes. Plus, what a delicious subject!"
5,Very Dainty...,Super pretty ring. Very well made. Looks very dainty on the hand. Black Hills Gold is classic & always looks good w/ anything.
4,A Dry Read,"Good stuff, but a pretty dry read - definitely one that you can put down, but still good when taken in small parts."
3,Todd Rundgren in Columbus,Nice footage for the Todd fan. Video quality is not up to today's standards but it's a lot of fun and very authentic. Good Bonus features. A good trip down memory lane.
4,Utopian Time Capsule,"this captures an era gone by, the picture quality is low but let's face it, the disk is geared towards die hard Utopia/ Rundgren fans and they will ove it. In comparison to other DVD/Video releases, this one has a ton of material, nothing at all is left out. There are true gems on this offering including obscure Kasim and Roger solo songs. It will be tough to have your non-Todd fans watch it with you...but who cares!"
2,Bootleg...,"On the box, it says and looks like this product has really good animations, sounds, and pictures. But when you really try it out, it looks like one of those old Windows 95 games. The graphics are bad, and the navigation is horrible.I would recommend that you do not waste your money..."
2,sadly inadequate history reference,"Home Life in the Colonial DaysI purchased Home Life in Colonial Days and was very disappointed to discover that even though the text regularly refers to illustrations on this page or that, there is not even one included in the book. It's rather like listening to a movie. Not at all what I had expected."
2,OK for free but better options out there,"Not an easy read and it spent too much time on stuff like telling the reader how to make soap when I was more interested in stuff like how often they used the soap to wash their clothes - which was also included but I just could have done without the soap making instructions. So I wound up skimming over some parts like that. But there were some details here and there of interest. I found the modern textbook ""Family Life in 17th- And 18th-Century America"" much more focused on things of interest but of course it's expensive whereas this is free as an ebook."
2,"Holy repackaging, Batman!","The two ""non-album"" tracks are not only featured on the import releases of ""We Have The Facts..."", but are also on ""The Forbidden Love EP"", which tends to sell for less than this single and is much better. Also, every track on it had never been previousily released, which is a big plus. What I'm saying is that this single offers NOTHING that you wouldn't already have if you'd purchaced earlier releases. Still, as much as I hate record labels repackaging old stuff without adding anything new to sweeten the deal, I have a strange urge to buy this since it is three of thier best songs and I'm dying to see the cover art."
4,cute set,"Not as soft as expected, do not misunderstand description like I did. It really is not soft, but set is cute set and well made. I use the brush to help detangling."
3,"Good Info, Bad Set Up","At first I was going to give this only 1 star but the journal does give good information and the lay-out to log in your daily food count is well set up. The problem I have with it is, first of all the cover screams ""I Will LOSE WEIGHT THIS TIME DIET JOURAL"" which makes it embarrassing (to me anyhow) to take anywhere with me. Also the spiral- binding is cheap and goes only half way around... which makes it impossible to fold over backwards for ease of writing. In other words, at the end of the day, when you sit in a comforatable chair or in bed and you want to fill in your information, the book has to stay open to both pages and it's difficult to write. I took the plastic spiral out and used garbage bag ties so I could fold the book backwards to write on. it's much easier. The Little ""Away from Home"" diet journal is very good because it is small fits well into any pocket book.I bought 2 copies and I will be returning the one that I didn't touch."
1,Hickey and Boggs,"100% PURE DRECK! I am a former 35mm film collector who once hadthis print in my collection. I also am a union projectionist and ran this film in Detroit area theatres when it first came out. When you buy DVD you expect DVD quality. This copy looks like a third or fourth generation dub from a worn out VHS tape in SLP mode. Some day MGM/UA will release a pristine print. In the meantime, save your money!"
5,3 down 2 to go,"Having read the various reviews of the Hickey & Boggs dvd I have decided to wait to get the dvd until a quality print is available. I saw this movie when it was released in the theatres. It is one of my 5 movies from that era that are on my list to own. The others are The Long Goodbye, Point Blank, Vanishing Point(all finally on dvd) H & B and Darker Than Amber. I have a poor quality uncut version of Darker w/ Dutch subtitles on VHS and I have a fairly good copy Of Hickey & Boggs I made from TCM that I recorded on DVD. Once a good DVD of Darker (uncut) is released and Hickey & Boggs my quest will be fullfiled. By all means if only a good VHS of H & B is available, get it. The movie is a classic"
1,The other guy is right,"Do NOT buy this DVD. I have seen beeter looking bootleg tapes -- in fact, that's pretty much what this transfer looks like. The image jumps, the sound is terrible, and I'm out 13 bucks. Shame on Amazon too, for lending this piece of garbage the veneer of legitimacy by offering it."
3,Overrated,"I sill can't believe I sat through how much episodes? I think 70? Waiting for this to get good. I truly fell for the hype. I mean I was expecting some great revelation but no such luck. This anime had it's interesting parts and some of the characters were really well done but in the end it can not save it from really being 3 stars. This is watchable and at times enjoyable but not groundbreaking, don't fall for the hype."
5,"Suspenseful, Unpredictable, Thrilling, and Emotional with lots of Humanity Elements","I was born and raised in Japan so I've read a lot of manga in the past. I must say, this is my most favorite manga of all time. I was so excited to get the animation version of it. I watched the DVD in Japanese first and then in English. I loved both versions, surprisingly. They did such a good job with English version. The animation itself is excellent, as well. It's almost the same as the original manga and I could not be happier with the results.Highly recommended. I can't wait to get the box set 2."
1,So disappointed with Viz,"Along with Cowboy Bebop, this is one of my favorite anime of all time. I originally watched all 74 episodes of this as fansubbs a few years ago and was thrilled to learn of the official English release. I wanted to give these people my money to support the industry so I bought this set in 2009. I was extremely disappointed to learn that Viz had cancelled the release of the rest of the series, and also to learn that this is not the first time a series and its fans have been treated so by them.If they release the rest of Monster I'll certainly buy it. However, I will *never* buy another partial series from Viz again, since they have proven themselves unreliable. Fool me once..."
1,found a sub email for monster requests,so hey saw the ratings by sergio999 and others and found kindof an email for VIZ.comit must be their sister site its in the contact info of the VIZ site then down in viewing permission and takes you to new people entertainment and then you can email dont know if it will work but i sent email # 1 about the monster series ....and we still dont know if they are just waiting for blu ray requests....good luck
1,Do not buy it!!!!,Good product but do not buy it because it is from the end of 2009 that Viz.com does not produce the second box. They do not have email to collect info and it seems a blocked series. The company is not reliable...
3,"Works fine, but charger buzzes and interferes with other appliances","This battery charger is light in weight, easy to pack, and does the job of recharging my LG VX4400 cell phone's battery just fine. But a few things do bother me about it: there is no UL listing--it's not UL approved--and it buzzes quietly when in use, which for some reason also interferes with anything plugged into the same circuit in my house (televisions, plugged in home phones, etc.) so that, for example, a TV plugged into the same circuit becomes unusable (bands of interference obscure the TV's picture) if I try to charge my battery and watch TV at the same time. But for the price, and considering the light weight and that it does do what it's meant for, I gave it 3 stars. It would've been 5 stars if it had been UL-approved and didn't interfere with other appliances on the same circuit."
3,"Very good, simple stapler for the price","This stapler does a good job with regular staples and doesn't require any special staples. My only disappointment is that it needs to be plugged into an electrical outlet while in use. The way it is displayed in the picture leads one to believe that it can be charged and stand alone without a cord & a socket. Mine cannot. Although I have no problem with my work space accommodating a stapler that needs to be attached to the wall socket, some work spaces really need the freedom of a stand-alone stapler. It does a good job and, for the money, is a good deal. - F. Parker"
3,It needs to be heaver,if i was i little bit heaver it would have worked better but it works great when you hold it
1,sad :(,Spend the extra few bucks and get one that works. There is so much of your own energy put into this I may as well use the old fashion stapler!!
2,Not so hot!,"If you have only 2 or 3 pages, this stapler is useless. Either it won't staple, or the staples leave sharp edges sticking out. I put 8 pages in and it works fine, but I almost never have that many sheets to staple. Might be OK for some mass mailing project if there are lots of sheets to staple, but for me it's just an expensive paperweight."
1,old girl friends,KATE DUCHENE from the worst witch plays jeff's old girl friend in clips. I wish they gave her a bigger part.
3,Tall Guy review,"Cute comedy if you are a fan of Rowan Atkinson, and Jeff Golblum. Not necessarily their best work but a cute story nonetheless."
4,No Swing-Out Ruler!!,"I have purchased Carl brand trimmers for years. I do a lot of scrapbooking and this is the only trimmer that has stood the test of time. I had to get a new one only because I carelessly left it on the floor when it fell and it ended up under the chair leg when I sat down. Bummer!So, when I was searching for another one, I came across this listing that stated that this one had a ""swing out ruler arm."" My only complaint with my last one is that it didn't have one of these. Well, much to my dismay, the write-up given on this listing is for a different model of Carl trimmer. THE DC-100 DOES NOT HAVE A SWING-OUT RULER ARM. I still gave the item 4 stars because I do love this trimmer, and I did keep it. I'm just bummed that Carl hasn't made this trimmer with a swing-out ruler.I hope others read this before buying, since you will not get what the item title and description states. (BTW...this company has the same write-up on their website for this trimmer.)"
4,Comfort and style,One of the most comfortable pair of shoes (with a heel) I've purchased in a long time!
1,Something is terribly wrong,"This is not the time to buy this product; something is terribly wrong with this line of ink refills.The Pen is a great idea and I love it, but somewhere in time something has gone wrong with manufacturing the ink.I wondered why it became hard to find them in the stores, probably multiple returns. Start looking for a new portable pen, these are done."
4,Sentence Skills Practice,This is a good book for anyone who needs to practice the usage and mechanics of writing and more importantly know how the syntax and style of a sentence creates reader reaction.
1,I did bought two books and I got just one book from the sender !!!!!!,I did ordered (Qty. 2) two of this book. For me and my roommate and I did got just one book !The order dose had the receipt and it says are two !I did emailed him twice and no answer yet for me !
4,Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas meets A Confederacy of Dunces,"Imagine Ignatius J. Reilly, the protagonist in A Confederacy of Dunces, twenty years older, twenty years wiser (and more neurotic), and 150 pounds fatter. Now imagine that Reilly has escaped from a North Carolina lunatic asylum that's masquerading as a fat farm. He is on the loose in a stolen laundry truck, wearing nothing but a hospital gown. His brain is addled by the intensely powerful drugs that have been pumped into him by the asylum's Nazi-like director. Like the characters in Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, our hero's on a road trip where reality is mutable and paranoia is a given.This wonderful novel is a fine read and it goes down quickly, easily and pleasurably. My only complaint is that the author deserved better editing; there are some plot inconsistencies and typos that a competent editor would have corrected immediately. Nevertheless, I give the book a strong recommendation."
4,great quick read,"this is an original, interesting story. very witty, i actually laughed out loud on the train while i read it. got a bit ridiculous at the end, but the ridiculous added to the overall humor."
4,One of her better books,"This was one of Connie Mason's better books. You have to be careful with her selections - the heros are not much in some of them. This one was much better. It is the story of a woman from the north who needs a husband to escort her on a wagon train. She talks a man from the south into this ""job"" offering money at the end. It is a delightful tale between the two as they form a real marriage from a pretend one. He does not cheat on her nor shows any interest to - very refreshing and nice and she is dedicated to making him see past his vengeance and what a life for them together can be.It is worth your time and expense to read."
5,Malibu Insulated Picnic Tote,"I am very pleased with this cooler/picnic tote. I bought it for a wedding present for a couple who love the outdoors. Delivery was prompt and the quality of the product is great.As always, I am more than happy with my total transaction with Amazon"
3,Expensive Treat,"This came exactly as described.I wanted to have a suprise picnic,and knew it would always come in handy.After getting this, it really isn't worth the price.Quality and looks OK,but just not enough stuff.I would buy a real wicker picnic basket next time.(probably from Amazon)for a classier,although less mobile picnic.Guess you cant have it all!"
3,Perfect gift for wine lovers,"This item was a gift for our daughter. She and her husband are planning on taking it with them on treks and adventure walks while they live in Germany. Which is also a reason that I liked purchasing it from Amazon, because I could have it shipped to an APO while still using the Super Saver Shipping option.I looked all over the internet and Amazon was the least expensive place to purchase it, even with discounts from the actual vendor."
4,Great for couples,"This is a great couples basket. I got this for a gift but enjoyed it first hand a few times. This makes picnics for two very convenient, with a good amount of storage.Pros: insulated cooler, wine/beer bottle holders, plates/accessories, shoulder strap, cutting board, comes in many colorsCons: cheap cloth napkins, plastic wine glasses"
3,"Great shirt, but sizes are larger than they appeared","This is a Great shirt, the only bad thing is the size, American sizes are way too big for Latin American people. size M feels more like a size L. When I try this shirt on size M realize that is a little big for me, but I used anyways."
2,against homogenous music making!,"Wolfgang Press developed much like Cabaret Voltaire, unfortunately. Strong beginings and lackluster ""commercialy successful"" later years. So, If you dig cookie cutter production and tunes, late era 'press is for you. However, if you value independent voices in the arts, early 'press is the thing to go for. This is a complete-ish compilation, spanning the band's entire career, but it almost feels like two different bands altogether. Some of the early song mixes are very good, but it pales in comparison to early gems such as ""Coming Home,"" ""Tremble (My Girl Doesn't)"" and ""Heart of Stone"" which are not included.Skip this and buy the individual early rec's if you value wonderfully weird music . . .'nuff said"
3,Ok,I had this book as an addition to a course text book. It was just good to have one to relieve stress that I needed to read a 3-inch-thick text book. Contents are simple and organized but not so much precise.
3,The New Toastmaster 4 slice,"First thing is this toaster is only 1500 watts. That would be great for a two slice toaster, but, 750 watts per each 2 slice side is weak. The toaster does partially close at the top of the slots while toasting, wich somewhat shortens browning time. My old 2 slice Sunbeam toaster had a sensor that detected the browning of toast wich was much more accurate than todays chip timers; plus, at 1375 watts it made toast in about 1 minute. The exterior of this 4 slice toastmaster is cheap stamped metal and it looks it.I would recommend looking for a 2 slice toaster with a minimum of 1000 watts."
1,Don't buy it!,"I bought this toaster about five months ago. Within one week after I bought it the black knob broke off, as the plastic is apparently of poor quality and the design inadequate. I am not surprised to have discovered here that many others also have had this problem. This is something that should not happen. I paid $45.oo plus tax for the item. I use it properly and the knobs break off! And within one week? Nonsense. It also takes a long time for the toast to darken. I believe this is due to the low wattage. I called eSalton today to complain as I did with Target. Got nowhere. Promised that some knobs would be shipped. Sure!"
1,adjustment knobs no good,"We just purchased this toaster yesterday from Target. We were at first skeptical if we should purchase because the display model had a missing knob and the one side was broken. The slats that cover pastry did not retract. Well, we went ahead and purchased it. We got it home, took it out of the box and one of the knobs was already broken and the other knob broke in our hands as we were trying to adjust the lightness and darkness. Needless to say, I am returning the toaster this morning and AM NOT going to exchange it. I want my money back"
1,toaster delema,"I bought this toaster from a target store in NJ 3 months agoi like to have toast almost every morning . the toaster wore out meaning i'm anable to push down the lever on both sides to turn it on anymore it instantly pops back up, i called tech supprt toastmaster.com..they were not any more help than to tell me basicaly to buy another toaster. so i'm switching back to my good old black and decker I might have a rare toaster problem but after finding out from other people some parts are only plastic! .. good luck"
5,loved this product,I've always loved the osbournes since the show started. I was very young when I watched it so it's so nice to be able to watch my favorite disfunctional family again :)
5,100% Osbourne's fan from Oz,For all Osbourne fans I recommend this dvd. From the episodes to the fun little games at the end. The only thing I have against the dvd is the commentary. Both kelly and Amiee constantly complain and tear into either their siblings or parents and grandfather(aimee). Personally jack did a better job in the previous dvd(commentary sense)!
2,Garbage!!,The Osbournes have become a parady of themselves. MTV now milking the success of the show to no end just like the Real World series. Ozzy Osbourne has gone from a music legend to a fumbling clown for MTV to exploit. It's all just a sad mess. Hopefully this painful show will see it's last season!!
3,There were 20 Episodes in Season Two..,They just screwed everyone into buying another set is what they did.. And the one I have *does* has censored and uncensored language..
3,Bonus material is Bogus,"Just purchased this DVD, season 2. The 10 episodes are from the original airings on tv but they are ""bleeped"" out as when being aired. The packaging lists it as 10 censored and uncensored scenes. False ! The only uncensored scenes are on the bonus disc.And that disc covers some extremely vague dialogue of no interest and is a waste of time. I was dissapointed but still get a laugh out of the fumbling ways of this family. They're a family with true love and money but it never seems to amaze me of just how spoiled these children are and wonder how soon that they would crack under the pressures of the real world if anything should happen to Oz and Sharon. These antics will be played out in the years to come and we shouldn't be surprised by what we see !!! I know I won't. How fast we fall..."
1,Daftest family on the planet,"Ozzy, is a rock megastar, but thats music. As for this family, they are totally and utterly f***ed. Kelly Osbourne, can't sing, and would be nothing if it weren't for her father, Jack, the gormless kid with the drug problems is plain daft. And Sharon is a typical self centered women, who belives that she is actually intelligent, though if it weren't for 'daddys money' nobody would have ever heard of her. I can some up this family in one from watching this DVD and the word is 'SIMPLE'!"
1,GARBAGE!,"Why anyone would pay 2 see this is beyond me? Here are a list of reason's why:1.)The Osbourne family is sick and perverted. They love watching their dogs take a s--- on the carpet and think their house is all clean with just a quick spray of cleaning products over the filthy areas of their house. Kelly loves to make out with her dogs as often as possible.2.) Jack should be forced to keep his shirt on at all times until he does not lose AT LEAST 5 STONE.3.) Practically every inch of Ozzy's body is covered with tattoo's, he looks like a mad homeless man who has not taken a shower for weeks. As he is completely illiterate he does not know that you can become HIV positive/get hepatitis if the tatoo needle is not cleaned properly.4.)Ozzy is an idiot, recall 'I just bought 300 pounds worth of chocolate and I don't even like it'."
2,Get Season One!! Forget Season Two!,"Yes Season Two had some wonderful moments, but alot of it was just a phony show of wealth, and the kids trying to capitalize on their 15 minutes of fame. They are barely ever in the house together at the same time, they're always running to London or something. Kelly released her album during this time, and lets just say the charts speak for themselves. The first season was Osbournes at their best, this is like having to listen to Kelly screech while stepping in a turd from Lola"
1,do not buy,do not buy this if you buy this you are getting ripped off you can buy the same thing... well its not a stylus but every thing else and that is same quality but $3 at walgreens in the pens and other school/office things aisle
2,Not what I expected,"I was disappointed with this book. I bought it to teach myself multivariate techniques. With little experience I bought this since it was an ""Introduction"". I did not get anything out of it. It may be great if you want an introduction to the theoretical side of this subject but for a practical introduction it was worthless."
4,tearjerker,"The main character of this story is Comfort Snowberger, a ten year old whose family owns Snowberger Funeral Home in Snapfinger, Missississippi. Comfort experiences deaths in the family and goes through rough times with friends. As sad as the book was I was surprised that there were bits and pieces of comic relief. The book deals with death and gives the readers the understanding that death is a part of life and learning to appreciate life. Families and friends show their love by coming together and being there for family/friends at times like these. Growing up I've had deaths in the family but they were never close relationships. It wasn't till recently that I lost a close friend which made the book a little tougher for me to read. As morbid as the book was there was comic relief and I would recommend this book to someone who has lost a loved one. I think kids could relate to this book and could possibly help them if they are having a hard time coping after losing a loved one."
5,"Sweet, southern story","Sweet, southern story of life and death and the way we learn to handle both. It's a favorite of my 5th and 6th grade reading classes. My adult book club laughed and cried their way through it, also."
5,one of my favorite books,even though it was really sad the writing was fabulous (a quote from my 7 year old son). we read this aloud and really loved it. Worth keeping on your shelf and passing on!
5,Great book,My 4th grader loved this story! It dealt with some difficult issues in a way that was appropriate for the 8+ age group. We all enjoyed the humor in the story.
2,shyane143,These filters are good they are just getting harder and harder to find and the price on them is much too high. They have become so difficult to find and so pricy I have quit using this water pitcher.
2,Undeserving of its Subject,"First off, the ""remastering"" here is deplorable. Five off the rack Bob Hope retrospectives dating from the '60s through the '90's. No attempt to return to the source material and clean it up. Also, the packaging seems to suggest an elaborate anthology especially prepared for this DVD release (timed to coincide with Hope's 100th birthday). Not the case. A major disappointment truly unworthy of its subject, the great Bob Hope."
3,"Triangles are fine, storage box is trash","Purchased these as an emergency kit for my wife's car. Read most reviews that product was ok, but the storage box was junk. They are correct. Package arrived and the red plastic storage box that contains the triangles basically disintegrated. The cheapest, most fragile container I've ever seen. Will need to go to some container store to find a real box to store the triangles. Do not expect to use the storage box if you purchase this item. Simply understand that you are purchasing the reflective triangles (which seem to be ok, hence the 3 stars)"
1,cheap storage box,The storage box makes this a one star. I ordered three and all the boxes were damaged do to the cheap and ridgid plastic box.
4,A good history of the midwest.,We enjoyed the visual accuracy of the film. The farmlands of Nebraska were beautiful. The acting was very good. Worth seeing.
1,This is not the Vineyard,"The New York Times was right: This book makes the Vineyard look like ""a minimal-security prison for the criminally self-absorbed"". There are so many better Vineyard-based cookbooks (like The Martha's Vineyard Cookbook--out now in its 3rd edition!)The recipes are so-so but the text you have to wade through to get to them will ruin your appetite."
2,Big disappointment!,"Having owned and enjoyed Potter's ""Gratitude"" and witnessed his pyrotechnic playing with the Dave Holland Quintet on their most recent tour, I was looking forward to this album with anticipation. Unfortunately, I was seriously disappointed. While his playing may be technically flawless, the derivative songwriting undermines it all. The songs all sound like instrumental outtakes from a Steely Dan session. This may be enjoyable for some listeners, but given Potter's reputation as one of the young lions advancing jazz into the new millennium, it's not at all what I expected or wanted."
5,Potter finds his own,"Chris Potter has been an amazing sax player for more than a decade, and continues to develop his uniquely personal, rhythmically strong, technically superb, emotionally rich style.But what's more interesting is the way his MUSIC evolves. This latest output (so far) showcases his writing and general musical thinking a lot more than the previous albums. This is a step in the right direction for Potter - his style and qualities are maybe even greater in this modern organic fusion context than the straightahead. It's in touch with its time.The band members, long time collaborators, each give their important contribution to making this one of the most interesting and compelling releases within the genre this year. Hats of to Potter and cohorts!"
5,Live and Studio,I saw this band at Ryle's in Boston and it was happening!! They played many of the cuts from the CD and delivered all the goods from this incredible project. No guitar on the gig though. Highly recommended on both counts!
3,thanks....,"a little to old to get the full functions on Windows XP.It needs to be upgraded by the Company, the CD-ROM..."
4,Perfect -- almost!,"This is a can't -live-without- it reference product. It's got all sorts of ways to help the writer or speaker. Is it Antartic or Antarctic? Athelete or Athlete? What's a four letter word synonym for morose? What is the correct pronouncement of herb? Whet? What rhymes with storage? There are at least 15 valuable word tools in this relatively inexpensive program. I would pay twice the price.That said, I had difficulty installing the software on my iMac G5 running O.S. 10.4. I ordered the CD (so glad I did) and everything was a snap except ... no pronunciation unless the CD was inserted. This is fixable, but not without cnversations with M-W. And their instructions didn't work well. PCs? I couldn't say. What the hell -- take a chance."
4,Merriam Webster Review,"This is a very complete dictionary. The word derivations are quite good. Also more definitions than the competition (American Heritage and Collins Co Built).I will not give it a 5 star, as the definitions are definitely more difficult to grasp than the ones from the above competitors."
2,Thesaurus not comprehensive enough,"The thesaurus part of this program is unfortunately not comprehensive enough. For example, it did not have any sysnonyms for the following words I typed in right after I installed it: vicarious, obscurantist, thunderous, proverbial, encase. The number of synonyms it offers for many words is pitifully small--just a few in many cases. The thesaurus provided with WORD is already more comprehensive, so there is really no reason to purchase this program if you are mainly interested in the thesaurus. To be fair, though, the program is very easy to install and use."
2,Good to have,I have been using M-W products for quite a long time. They suffer some user unfriendly features.I like to see the following improvements in this product:1. Hot keys to navigate in different fields. For ex. (Ctr+1) to take me to definition field.2. A function key (say F3) to replace double mouse click for pronunciation.3. The window remembers its size.
1,Ugly Font Makes Viewing Distasteful,The font used in the entry window is plain ugly; so ugly in fact that I doubt I will replace my American Heritage Dictionary with this one. The characters are too close together and some portions of some characters are lined too heavily. My system is Microsoft Windows 2000. As a test I installed the product on another W2K system with the same result.Other notes: it tries to install Adobe Acrobat over a more recent version.
2,Problematic book structure,"I purchased this some time ago and give this only 2 stars because I discovered the tabs carved into the pages indicating the letters of the alphabet are in some cases incorrect..for example, open where it indicates the VZ entries should be and you will instead find ""biological names."" This is just carelessness on the part of the publisher and really quite inexcusable. For this reason, I wouldn't recommend this dictionary. Had I known this before I purchased it, I would not have bought it."
3,"Good, but it can not be run in XP","It is interesting that this software runs well at my home's XP, but not the XP in my office. It says there is some problem with xnmba500.dll. I don't know anybody can help me out of this problem."
1,"limited, buyer beware","it's nice to have the audio option but fails to have a comprehensive listing of words. and installation was very tricky. last but not least, don't know if it can be installed on more than one computer. bummer. buyer beware, can't get any customer service on the product either."
4,A picture complements a thousand words,"This book is exactly what it purports to be: a collection of photos documenting the RAF. Astrid Proll's short 1998 narrative and musings on her experiences makes somewhat interesting reading, but this is not a history or work of analysis, and readers who are seeking such will be disappointed. _Pictures on the Run_ serves as a unique and invaluable accompaniment to Stefan Aust's volume, and should be seen as such. If the reader isn't already familiar with the photo subjects, s/he will only be perplexed by the single line captions. If like me, however, you are intrigued by the RAF and the Deutsche Herbst, you will keep this book beside you as you read Aust, Becker, Vague, and Baumann. You will return to the pictures again and again, and some of the faces will haunt you."
5,Injustice,"The core founders of the Baader Meinhoff group Andreas Baader, Ulrike Meinhof and Gudrun Ensslin {an equal number were women} were murdered in their prison cells by authorities of the wealthy Federal Republic of Germany and then framed as suicides. Astrid Proll was a minor activist who served a jail sentence and then fled to England, she is not representative of this movement and some of her comments are wrong, but the photographs of these fallen young revolutionary's are intriguing."
1,A waste of money.,"While some of the accounts are informative, this book is simply a blatant project to make money. The crimes committed by the group were hideous and, how better to squeeze a little more out of the publicity by justifying them?The photographs in this book are bad, taken by an amateur and tell no story. They're of minimal interest and do nothing to help explain anything of what really went on behind these scenes. I do not understand how the reviewer from the New York times can describe the pictures as ""daunting"" ad ""carefully selected"". They're a haphazardly thrown together group of nothing. If these were the best of the bunch, the bad ones must have been terrible.I think I might be a little less hostile if this book were a lot cheaper, but I was expecting a lot more substance and pictures of more than marginal interest. My advice would be to try and check this book in the local library first to make sure it is what you thought it was."
1,what you get is not what is pictured,I ordered the Toastmast griddle and was sent a different Farberware griddle - be very careful about a switch in products!Toastmaster TG21W 21-Inch Griddle
1,Be Carefull,"I ordered this griddle through Amazon (Acehardware Outlet) and was sent something completely different. I have had a misserable time trying to return the inferior product to Acehardware Outlet. I am still trying to purchase a real Toastmaster 21"" griddle."
2,substituted a product without permission,A different griddle than ordered was susbstiiuted without checking.I had a special reason for odering the Toastmaster '21'. A Farberware griddle of smaller surface was sent under the guise of a Toastmster.Not good business!!!!JF.Metzger
4,It's Addicting...,If you like playing cards this is a great game. I think it's geared more for the older ages groups. Great way to unwind with a glass of wine and fun board game.
5,Great game for 2-9 people,"We had a lot of fun playing this game for the first time last night. I see this being pulled out frequently in our family and when playing with others. The strategy in the game is figuring out where best to place your pieces to get a sequence and also preventing others from getting a sequence. We liked the No Table Talk rule in which you lose a card (you only have 6) if you give hints or comments about plays or turns. This keeps it honest and also allows the other rule to kick in - if you don't pick up your card before the next person completes his/her turn by picking up a card, you lose out and you're left with fewer cards to play."
5,Sequence is fun for everyone,I played this game with family and friends and knew beforehand that I would like it when I bought it.
5,The best game ever,Everyone we introduce to Sequence absolutely loves it!!!!! And they all subsequently buy it. We have our three sons and their partners visiting at the moment and have bought it for them for Christmas.
4,Family fun,So much fun we lost track of time this is truly a game of strategies the use of the jacks made moves unpredictable and a whole lot of family fun? Make sure the seller does not send it media mail it does not qualify and cost me a additional $ 3.31
5,Sequence,Great game Makes you think how to out fox other players. My eight year old grandson can play this. A game for every age child to adult. It is more fun with 3 or 4 players.
4,Sequence,"not only have we enjoyed the game, all we have played it with did also.Some have purchased it, and this is our 3rd order."
5,We LOVE This Game!,"This is a fun and addictive game. I like the fact that any age can play the game as well. There is strategy involved and you find yourself lost as you try to remember what the strategy you had in your head the last round was.... but this is part of the fun. The game is well made and will last a long time. Our 5 year old has just as much fun as us playing the game. He may have a disadvantage as he is just places down the chips without using much strategy, but even still, manages to get a sequence now and then. I would recommend this game for great family fun."
5,Love it!,"My parents originally played this game on vacation in Florida but didn't have a lot of space for extra things in their camper. So my dad created a version of it on the bottom of the dog cage! We finally broke down and actually bought the game. Normally we play on teams (2 people to a team), but you don't have to play it that way. It is very engaging and strategic... and one of my all-time favorite board games!"
2,Not a lot of strategic depth,"The design of this game tends to constrain player choice heavily, preventing you from hatching and executing satisfying strategies. Most of the game result comes down to pure luck and good timing in the use of wildcards. The reason this is the case is that the game requires a 5 in a row to win, but the rows you can play are bingo style to cards you are drawing... So it ends up being mostly pure chance.I do like that the game is extremely easy to learn, so from that perspective its a plus, but there are a lot of card games and board games that are just as easy to learn, but significantly more interesting from a strategy perspective.While this is likely to be a fun family game, it's pretty terrible for adults who play board games in general"
4,St.Louis married couple,"This game is great for 2 or 3 people. I haven't tried the team version, but probably would work well with younger kids.Its takes strategy to and isn't as easy as you think."
5,Play for Hours...It's Addicting,"This game is so much fun. You can play one on one, or play in teams with a bunch of other people. It does however get really stressful when you lose, but that's what keeps drawing you back to play again...and possible win the next time. It's a great mix of luck and strategy. I discovered this game a while ago and everyone that I show it too gets hooked. Awesome game."
5,Cool,"This summer I worked at a kids camp, and this was the new game in the closet. I played it the first night and played 4-8 times a day for the whole week! We got addicted (and we are adults!). I had so much fun, and I think it is a very challenging game, because you are playing against teams. I can't wait to buy this game for my personal use. One of the ladies at the kids camp bought the game for her house a couple of weeks ago, after she taught her husband how to play, he got addicted too and started bringing the game to bed with them, ""Come on Honey, one quick game!"""
5,An easy to understand board game for ages 10 - 100,Excellent game for new players - they love it. We find it best when played by two teams of of two (4 people) though other combinations are possible. It is also a great tournament game for two to four tables of 4. There is scope for differing winning strategies.
4,Thoughtful Game,"Sequence is a game that's a nice mix of chance and strategy. In that sense, it is not as confrontational as a game might be if it were purely intellectual, e.g. chess or checkers. We also like the flexibility of being able to play with 2 to 12 players. Also like conventional card games, it provides virtually limitless situational variations."
5,Sequence is great!,Sequence is a great game for adults too. The rules are simple but it does make you think. You not only play your pieces but you have to watch the opponents too. Our family really enjoys it.
4,Fast,"I didn't open the package yet because I am planning to give as a gift. However, game in very good condition and the shipping was very fast. I like it"
4,Fun..... for a while,"Sequence is fun for the first few weeks after purchasing it, but after a while it becomes boring. It is a very simple game that anyone can understand. Although it does involve a bit of luck, it involves more skill and strategy that people would think.While the board and chips are strong, the cards are very flimsy. The rules state that you should play until someone gets 3(?) sequences, but I find it much more fun to play until either all the chips are used up or until there are no more cards left. Our family enjoys occasionally pulling out Sequence to play every once in a while.If you like strategy and want to play this game with young children, this game is great. I find it a bit dull and for anyone looking for a bit more excitement, I recommend that you purchase a different game."
2,I just don't get it I guess,"This game seems to get a lot of attention and praise. Some of my fellow revieweres here have even given it high ratings for educational value.. EDUCATIONAL VALUE?? I guess it helps in pattern and color recognition, and how to correctly count from one to five but this game has about as much educational value as watching old reruns of Leave it to Beaver and about as much strategy as connecting Legos. For good, fun and unique family games, try Carcassone, or Settlers of Catan (unfortunaly, Amazon does not carry the better board games, you have to get them elsewhere)"
1,No Skill Involved,"This game is one of the most pedantic, boring games I've ever played. It requires no skill. The idea is that you have a board with all the cards printed on it. Then you draw real cards from a deck. Then you put a chip on a printed card from one you have in your hand. The first person to get five in a row wins. What sort of strategy is that? You don't even have to be awake to play this game. But if you have a very precocious 9 month old, they may think it's fun. But I doubt it."
4,Good group strategy/party game,"The bigger the group, the more interesting this game becomes. Requires thought, but the strategy is pretty straightforward. Not the ideal game for those how prefer moving and shouting."
5,Game for the whole family,I bought this for my grandchildren. The rules are easy to learn and remember. 2 to 12 can play. Dealt playing cards are played to match the cards on the board. There are wild cards also. The object is to get five cards in a row which isn't as easy as it sounds. Ages 7 to 70 have enjoyed playing.
1,sequence game,This game is lots of fun for kids and adults. We had a birthday party for a 14 year old and none of the kids knew how to play. We taught them the game and they played for a couple of hours and wanted to start playin again the next morning.
4,Sequence game,"This game was recommended by co-workers. My husband and I enjoy playing Sequence. If I had known more about the game when ordering, I would have ordered the Jumbo Sequence version. There are many different versions available for children as well with educational value.Jan B."
5,A fun family game,"My 6 year old loves this game, yet it holds the interest of adults as well.I teaches a little bit of strategy to the young 'uns, forcing them to make decisions and plan ahead.It's a quick game to play, and remains a favorite in our family."
4,Sequence,"My husband and I never really like to play board games like some of our friends, but Sequence was introduced to us one evening by a couple we went to a Bed and Breakfast at a Winery and they brought the game. We spent the whole evening challenging each other and had so many laughs. I just had to order it from Amazon and now when friends come over we ask if they want to play Sequence and it helps past the time while having fun and enjoying conversation with our friends."
4,Great Family Game,"Sequence is one of those classic games that takes minutes to learn and much longer to master. Simply play cards from your hand to place a marker on the corresponding card on the board. Once you or your team have a sequence, or two, of 5 in a row, you win.The game teaches attention, forethought, and focus to younger kids. While there is a certain degree of skills required to be successful, there is also an element of luck that can help any player win.If you're looking for a light, social game, with high replayability, this could be a game for you."
5,BARNEY'S LAND OF MAKE BELIEVE,"Barney: The Land Of Make BelieveMy son is almost two years old. For some reason, this DVD is his favorite. There are many songs and dancing, and he just can't get enough of it. If there is anyone who's children love singing and dancing, I highly recommend trying this video with them. Everytime we put it in, his eyes light up with excitement and he sings and dances out every scene. It also plays continuously which is a good feature for us."
4,Barney's Land of Make Believe,This is such a great and exciting DVD - My grandchildren and I was glue to the TV and what was so special my grandson farourite trailer of the Wiggles included which was a bonus for him.
1,Worst Toaster Oven EVER!,"Burns the back edges of whatever is placed into it (no matter what the height of the rack) and leaves the front edges cold. What else do I need to say? It is over priced, does not work properly and is absolutely the worst toaster oven either my wife or I have ever even heard of let alone owned!"
1,Toastmaster Oven-Broiler Model TTOB4RL,"This is without a doubt the worst appliance I have ever owned. It takes 10 minutes to heat up and on the lowest setting, burns bread."
1,WORST TOASTER OVEN EVErrrrrrrrrrrrrrr,"SHOULD HAVE FOLLOWED MY INSTINCTS WITH THE OTHER REVIEWS. HOW ON EARTH COULD TOASTMASTER COME OUT WITH SUCH A HORRIBLE PRODUCT? AFTER GOING THROUGH A HALF A LOAF OF BREAD, I GIVE UP!!!!!!!!!!!! TAKES FOREVER FOR THIS OVEN TO HEAT UP & BURNS YOUR TOAST BEYOND RECOGNITION.... THOUGHT ABOUT DONATING IT TO SALVATION ARMY, BUT IT'S NOT EVEN WORTH THAT. WHAT A WASTE OF MY MONEY.... HOW SAD THAT ANYONE IS ABLE TO SELL THIS PRODUCT. MAKE SURE YOU TAKE YOUR BATTERIES OUT OF YOUR SMOKE ALARM. I DID GIVE THIS PRODUCT ONE STAR, BUT IF THERE WAS A ZERO THAT'S EXACTLY HOW I WOULD RATE IT.... A BIG FAT ZERO"
1,Your Toast will never be the same,"Is there anything more annoying than a toaster or toaster oven than cannot toast a piece of bread the same way twice? Leave the controls alone and watch, they'll all come out different. Which means this device is nothing more than an enormous pile of ...well, an enormous paperweight. Stay clear."
1,Great if you like burnt food...,"This toaster oven burns everything. If you make toast on the lightest setting, it will be black well before the timer goes off. I've burned things on the lowest temperature setting as well.I know that it is a flaw with the design, because I returned the first oven thinking it was defective. But no, the second oven burned just as well as the first!My advice: Stay far, far away from this item."
2,Vent cap,Not happy that Amazon shows the complete assembly when offering a part. Several times I wanted the complete assembly - the picture showed the complete assembly - but received only a part. No text to describe the product either. Result several returns before getting the correct item.
2,Not for the great unwashed,I guess I just don't make enough money to relate to the author and his tone throughout the book.Although he makes many statements that he is not a pipe snob or elitist this book comes acroos a written by a wealthy man FOR wealthy men (or wealthy pipe collectors). Those of us who smoke pipes that cost less than a years salary are left to feel somewhat.........well. like we are not quite up to the authors level of society and certainly could not understand how amazing it is to smoke or own an S Bang etc.It just left me feeling I had paid money to be told by a snob that I am not good enough for his club.
4,"Not only it's safer, but it makes it more comfortable.","In my car the way my XM radio is positioned, I was getting cramps in my arm and shoulder pressing the buttons all the time; think about it, with all those stations why stay on one station if they are not playing something you like. So for that reason I needed the remote ASAP!One complaint, and I think it happened twice so far. For no reason the remote failed to respond; I reseated the battery and all is well."
1,Not worth the money!,"Both my wife and I have this remote for our Delphi Roady 2 & Delphi Roady XT respectfully. We have the exact same problem with them. If it sits in the car on a hot summer day, it works fine. If I bring it in the house with my receiver to listen to XM inside - after a while, IT WILL NOT WORK! USELESS!! Please don't waste your money on this remote."
5,Who could have predicted I would have liked this vendor so much? Maybe the Oracle at -where else- Delphi?!? ;),"Really impressed with the quality of the Delphi Roady Remote control sent to me by vendor. Small enough to carry and keep in my car but large enough buttons to use without too many problems. If there's one minute drawback, it's that I can't really use it for my home XM radio due to the fact that it's range is limited (basically pointing right next to it). But, again, love it for my car as it allows me to run the range of preset stations without too much effort or looking away from my driving. Also loved the fact that it shipped so quickly from the vendor. Very satisfied with the very good product and great price (one caveat: you do have to buy batteries ;(. Oh, well ;). Thanks!"
5,Pleasantly Surprised,"Granted, I had to go get a battery, luckily the local pharmacy had one. I thought about taking the BIOS battery out of one of my computers. I'm glad I risked a whopping $2, this works with my XM OnyxXM XDNX1V1 Onyx Dock-and-Play Radio with Car Kit (Black)so I can use it in the car and keep my eyes on the road. I think it works best at home in the houseXM XADH1 Universal Dock-and-Play Home Kit (Black), I haven't bothered to see if my Dish remote can do it... it's programmable maybe I can, would still need this remote. Anywho, I'm rambling, if you have an Onyx and you use it in the house or you've mounted it uncomfortably far away, this is worth the few bucks..."
5,"Good Remote, you must buy a battery",The buttons on this remote are spaced nicely which allows you to feel them easily. This keeps you from looking down and taking your eyes off of the road (main reason I bought it). The buttons also glow in the dark. The size is perfect. Fits the hand nicely. No lag noticed when using for my roady2 receiver.The package states it comes with a battery(although amazon did not). Amazon is right. You need a CR2032 battery. This is the same size found in most garage door opener remotes.It is ridiculously low priced! You could get a few spares for what it costs! The batteries cost as much as the remote. Probably why they aren't included for this price.
4,it works fine,there is not a lot to say about it but to say it does what it need to the glow in the dark keys really not that great
4,Delphi SA10042 XM Radio Roady Remote Control,"I purchased the Delphi SA 10042 XM Radio Roady Remote Control, You sent it to me, I have been using it... I am happy, You are happy.. nuff said."
2,Does not work in the cold,I have had my roady for a couple of years and have noticed that when the weather is cold it does not work. I have to place it on my heat vent or sit on it to warm it up before it will work. Since it is even colder out now it takes almost my entire ride to work for the thing to warm up enough to work. It isn't a battery issue since I already bought new batteries to make sure it isn't the problem.
3,just *slightly* less COUNTER-INTUITIVE than the Roady2!,"...I mean, I'm glad I forked over $15 for this thing, since fiddling with my Roady 2 while driving was a certain deathwish because the buttons are so atrociously placed.But really, almost 2 months later, I *STILL* have to look down at this darn remote to do anything other than push one of the 10 preset buttons. When I compare this remote's ease of use and learning curve with that of my other remotes (the Pioneer car stereo, home audio receiver, home DVD player, etc.) it really is a hopeless mess.GRRRR! Whoever decided what each button does and where it gets placed on both the Roady *console* AND the Roady *remote* is either a total retard or a total sadist, and in either case deserves to be summarily shot!!!I also wish that this remote had backlit buttons for night operation.Maybe the people who design the XM satellite interfaces are the same people in charge of torturing detainees at Abu Gharib...lol"
5,New Model Army Live,"Great show, finally a DVD for US consumption. Good camera angles, good song list."
2,Hostile Makeover: A crime of Fashion Mystery,"Her books are to easy to put down. Not a top women's sleuth writer by any means. A romance that never happens,how long can you drag it out and keep readers interest. I gave it a fair chance, 3 books (which I had a hard time finishing) and I am definitely done with this writer. She drag things out for ever. Same story just a little different twist each time. Definitely overrated!"
1,Terrible,"This series didn't start out great, but now it's gotten just terrible.The author seems to be trying to go for ""snappy"" and ""witty"" with her dialogue and she's falling far short. It comes across as awkward, juvenile and cliched. And the italicized asides are very annoying -- if there wasn't so much drivel, the asides could be worked into the actual conversations, rather than distracting the reader by appearing after Lacey speaks.Rose and Cherise were like a couple of cartoon characters. There was nothing believable or enjoyable about them at all. And it made no sense that an independent adult like Lacey would drag them around with her and put them in danger, catering to their idea that crime solving is fun, rather than putting her foot down that she had to work and they couldn't come tag along with her.On top of all this, the ending was very predictable. You could figure out the murderer almost as soon as he appeared in the story.I gave this series enough chances. I'm done with it."
2,Great cure for insomnia,"If you need something to read before bed, that isn't fast paced or mind bending, this is book is for you. It's also a great read if you suffer from insomnia. I think the Lifetime movie was better and that's saying a lot since it was pretty awful in its own right. The dialogue is clipped, unfunny, and the lead character is annoying. I couldn't relate or sympathize with her character."
2,NOT MY FAVORITE BOOK,I have many of Ellen Byerrrum paperback books... I didn't like this one as much as others... Chapter 31 the ending seemed rather silly to me...it didnt have the punch of a solving of a murder mystery. The story line was good up until that point. I think the ending could have been better...
4,"cute, entertaining series","I really enjoy this series. Its not brain surgery or world peace, but its clever and entertaining and a lot of fun. Not the run-of-the-mill female detective type of book, nor is it a woman's romance novel. There's a little of both, plus a lot of wit and creative characters mixed in. A fun read!"
4,A woman's exploration into a coming of age romance that neve,"Having recently relocated from Chicago to Los Angeles with a new husband and her first love's daughter, Susan is thousands of miles away from home.Suddenly distraught over the death of her first love, Susan can't get Rick out of her thoughts. It doesn't help that his presence is felt strongly by both she and her new husband.In an intensely personal coming of age exploration, Susan discovers and relives, through flashbacks, her tormented relationship with Rick from beginning to end.Upon investigating his murder, Susan learns more about herself than she'd realized possible, and thus is finally able to let go of some of the pain that has haunted her for over twenty years.Through this confrontation, the past ceases to be a ball-and-chain; the future-still full of uncertainty-is no longer to be feared."
2,Fuel for the world's Lee Harvey Oswalds,"Piper premised ""A Planet for Texans"" (APFT) on the idea that you have a right to murder with impunity any democratically elected politician you don't like, and he showed it in action on a planet settled by descendants of Texans. I have to wonder if Lee Harvey Oswald got his inspiration from reading APFT before he assassinated President Kennedy in the terrestrial Texas in 1963. APFT doesn't look that far removed in spirit from ""The Turner Diaries,"" which inspired Timothy McVeigh to bomb the Murrah building in 1995."
3,Nice one but.......,"It is a nice book.But for me,I love Shleifer's ""Inefficient market"" more.This book focus on the Divident-to-price ratio and use it for the analysis of the market volatility.The writer does give us some insight about the market.But I doubt if it could stand for a long... since the market is changing all the time."
4,Great fun show...,"Probe was a tv pilot movie which eventually turn into Search (due to some rights issues) weekly series. The show was certainly ahead of its time in using the ""probe"" eye which can detect light spectrum,electro-magnetic waves,analyzed human respiration. Most of the episodes are smart & entertaining too bad it only lasted 1 season. I took away 1 star because Warner Bros did a sloppy job of transcribing to dvd even though it is a vod the movie looks good in some spots but especially in the beginning all the colors are washed away. I watch other WB archive discs like El Condor & Yes, Giorgio both films look sharp & pristine and both are vods. Don't know why Probe look so poorly and as far as I know Probe was never release in vhs format in North America, if WB use a superior vhs to transcribe it it should look half way decent."
2,"It wasn't well acted, filmed, cast needs a lot of help. It's easy to see why it only lasted one season",I enjoyed Hugh O'Brian in Wyatt Earp and some of his other attempts but this really was pretty bad. Acting and casting was pretty bad. It looked like a attempt to take a little from this current series and a little from that then put it a blender and hope it comes out right. It didn't work.
2,Technology '70s and just as bad,The story line is technology based and is more hardware than software. Shows its age. Everything is angular without momentum. Probably would be a good MysteryScience 2000 movie. 10 years before PCs.
3,Just barely veiwable.,"The plot is terrifyingly non-original, and the characters themselves remind me of any other anime character, so there is nothing of interest there as well. The desighns are not all that nice looking either. I wouldn't actually *buy* this tape."
5,Johnny Carson DVD Box Set,The item I purchased is wonderful. It is everything it was advertised to be and at a reasonable price also. The DVD set arrived in a timely matter also.
4,Thanks!,"This showed up as it was described, brand new. It took a little longer to arrive than I had anticipated, however it did make it before Christmas, as it was a gift to my father! Thanks!"
5,live longer... Laugh,"Outstanding, every Carson fan should own this. It's too bad we had to bid him farewell. The spontanious wit of Johnny Carson will keep em' rollin' in the aisles, and add a few extra years to our lifespan."
4,Nice DVD,"Bought for my dad for Christmas, he really enjoyed watching it. Would like to have seen a little more of each show, but pleased overall."
5,Hheeeerrrreeee'ssss Johnny!,"This is the best of the best of Johnny Carson and his humor. There is a good variety of guests and a great trip down memory lane to see all of these actors, etc. when they were much younger."
4,Johnny Carson Collection Vols. 1-3,This is the best and funniest compilation dvd of Johnny Carson I have ever seen. It is absolutely hilarious.
2,Disappointing,"The great comics that appeared for years on the Tonight Show, such as Don Rickles and Rodney Dangerfield, are largely ignored. All the great band music isn't here. Only one singer is featured, Bette Midler, crooning to Johnny on the final show. Only traces of the opening monologues appear. The best feature is a Steve Martin bit on the second disc: The Great Flydini. Now that's funny! But on the whole, this is a great disappointment, and certainly not worth the money."
3,The Ultimate Collection Lacks,"I am a huge fan of Johnny Carson and I debated on buying this DVD simply because of the price. I watched all of his shows rarely missing any. But this was a dissapointment as he has alot of shows with Richard Harris, Robin Williams, and alot of bands that would come sit with him the whole show and you would have a stomach ache the next day from laughing so hard. None of these were on this DVD. I would say out of the 30 odd years they only took maybe 5 years of shows out of it. I remember far funnier shows. He was the best there was, but if I could return this DVD I would cause it is lacking on so many great shows. I feel a little ripped off."
4,The Almost Original Johnny Carson Collection,"I bought the VHS version of the JOHNNY CARSON COLLECTION sometime in 1994 and I loved it. I watch that collection over and over again. When it came avalible for DVD, I knew that I had to get it upgraded to that format. I enjoyed all the unseen and added features that was on this new DVD box set. I was just disapointed in the fact that they edited a few skits out of the Collection. I love the skits with Johhny Carson and Julio Iglesias singing ""To All the Girls I've Love Before "" and the skit with the Smothers brothers. Perhaps there were some issues on copyright laws to add these musical numbers on the DVD collection. I hope to see these skits again someday even if I have to buy a used VHS copy of the TRUE original JOHNNY CARSON COLLECTION."
4,"Not enough material, but still very enjoyable","While I agree with many of the reviewers that there are far too few clips in this set, and they are often too short, there is still enough good material to be able to sit back and remember what Johnny Carson's Tonight Show was all about.Surprisingly, I found one of my favorite parts of the set to be ""Johnny Goes Home"", the 1982 documentary about Johnny's visit to his hometown. It's not a ""laugh-a-minute"" show, and obviously wasn't meant to be. It's a very warm, nostalgic trip back in time. It's not the least bit boring, as some reviewers have said.Let's hope the Carson family will decide to release more clips from the Tonight Show on DVD, perhaps even entire shows, so that those of us who fondly remember when Johnny was King of Late Night can see many more of our favorite moments."
4,Timeless Class Act in Carson Collection,I was a little kid when Johnny Carson left the Tonight Show but I have great memories of watching him on vacation in my families' Las Vegas hotel room.This dvd set is great. It captures all of the highlights of Johnny Carson's career in Late Night. It has many of the major guests you would expect to see except for the early years because the tapes have been erased. My major complaint with this dvd set is it does not have enough of the fabulous monoluges throughout the years.
2,Why do they do stupid !?@^$% like this?,"The video quality stinks, and it was apparently done on purpose.The DVD company reduced the image rate, removing half the video data in a headache-inducing attempt to simulate the look of movie film (instead of the original videotape look).It's hard on the eyes as well as inauthentic and ahistorical. I bought this as a replacement for the old laserdisc release, but I'll be keeping those laserdiscs because they look and sound much better.What is the point of deliberately degrading the quality of perfectly good source material?"
5,Johnny Carson episodes shown on Direct TV,I bought and watched the 3 dvd set. It was really geat. I remember a few years back that direct tv showed entire episodes for one year. I believe you got two or three episodes a week for 5.95 per month. I of course being a huge fan gladly paid the money. After one year the service was cancelled. When I asked direct tv why it was cancelled they said that the owners of the Crason material did not wish to continue the deal. I know for this reason that there are a lot of full episodes. I wish that Carson productions would offer this deal to direct tv again.
5,Awesome knife,Very nice and sharp knife. the knife is very small but still a good knife. The knife is beautiful looking also.
4,Trouble in North-Dakota,"Once again we meet Lois Masterson`s anti-heroic main character Morgan Kane in an action packed novel. This time his foes are indians on the rampage, canadian smugglers, wolves and grizzly bears, and last but not least the harsh unfriendly cold of the Dakota-winter. As normal the book is filled with breathtaking scenery-depictions and thorogh weapon-descriptions. A most interesting and exciting novel, though a bit short. Definately worth the money."
4,Great for extra help...,"With taking Geometry this year, I got stuck with a not so great teacher, and decided I needed extra help. We saw this product, and decided to purchase it. So far, it has great animated examples, quizzes, and tests. It also includes a ""game"" for when you pass a test with a good grade. This program contains eight discs starting at pre-algebra going up to calculus and also statistics, and ""real life math."" A great deal for brushing up or using for high school, like I am!"
2,Would not install correctly,"After installing the sound did not work on the computer (returning to a restore point fixed that). Their online support seems to indicate that this is a common problem. We run Windows XP with multiple users. I assume it couldn't handle that, at any rate I received many errors in path names when I tried to run it, although it did seem to come up. We are relatively computer astute, and maybe could have gone in and fiddled with things to make it work - but I don't want to. Its going back.Another down-side for me is that it consists of single CD's for each level of math, all of which need to be installed separately. Plus it has to be run from CD, not from the hard disk which is a negative for us since we want to make it as easy as possible for our kids to use!"
1,Very old design style - lame interactivity,"This uses Macromedia Director software to accomplish it's animation . .which is all fine and well until you realize they are stuffing you into a tiny box . . .with black backgrounds and white text. Do they know nothing about usability?I can't get very far into this, but throwing up some text on a small screen and reading it . .. is hardly dynamic.Might help some . .but with my screen resolution at 1024x768 I'd actually like to use more than 1/4 of my screen to learn.Lame, lame, lame."
3,Who knew?,"My wife ordered this without noticing that it was a Spanish translation. Since she doesn't read Spanish at all, it just sits in the Kindle."
2,dog laxative,This did not work on my little mini pin. Had to end taking him to the vet to get meds to help him which was mirlax.
2,not happy,First mobile pirchase through kindle. Not happy. I got a message that something was wrong. Under the impression i did not buy the book until i received your mail to review it
1,Boring,"I've read as many of Heyer's novels as I can find and there's something to like or love about every one EXCEPT for ""Royal Escape"". The characters are flat and there is no plot!! I only finished it because I hoped that it would get better and Ms. Heyer's wit would shine through. No luck- I didn't even like the character of the King. please, don't spend time on this when you could be reading the Alastair Trilogy (These Old Shades, Devil's Cub, etc.) or ""The Masqueraders"", all of which are absolutely marvelous."
3,"Not Heyer's best, but not that bad","If you love Heyer's light-hearted romances, or her mysteries, this may not be for you. It is more history than romance, and as the former reviewer stated, it's a little hard sometimes to distinquish the ""good guys."" Nevertheless, it is reasonably true to the period and the events. There were then, as now, Puritans and Puritans. Not all were exactly blameless - the ""Roundhead"" forces were guilty of as many atrocities as the other side. Incidents such as the one the former reviewer finds so objectionable did happen. To the Puritans, these people were Satan's tools as well as traitors. Many of the Catholics felt the same way about the Puritans, and Heyer does favor that side.As for the Stuart immorality - none of the royal houses of Europe of that period (or any?) were known for their blameless lives where the opposite sex was involved."
4,Surprisingly Good,"Heyer's historical novels are typically not my favorites, but this one--possibly because it's so accurate and well-paced--was fascinating and fun. Even had I no knowledge of the events, it would be a great read. But Heyer's able to flesh out the facts of the well-known story. Since, as her husband boasted, her research is thorough and flawless, I never had to wonder (as one must with so many authors of this ilk), ""Did it really happen like that?"" That's one of the things that makes Heyer such a comfortable author: she's trust-worthy."
3,The Flight,"Charles II, a king with a price on his head must flee England so as not to lose his head as was the fate of his father in Georgette Heyer's THE ROYAL ESCAPE. The story lacks the bounce and style of her wonderful Regencies, but then it is an often told true story. When everyone knows the story it does not have the spice of fiction and yet this is a beloved story of a young man who would later regain his thrown.Not the best of Heyer's works, but it is worth a read to explore other aspects of her writings.Nash Black, author of SINS OF THE FATHERS and HAINTS."
4,A suspence killer!,"This book is totally awesome! It is so full of suspence! If you want an exciting book to read go no farther for you have come to the right place. When you start reading this book it's hard to stop reading. Also you get a sudden rush of emotions while reading like anger,hatred,excitment,and love all rolled up into one book!"
3,HARRISVILLE LOOM .... IS NOT THE BEST LOOM DEAL,"I had intended to purchase this Harrisville Easyweaver, but after consulting with two very experienced weavers, was advised that there is a MUCH better quality, and very easy to use loom, available for a similar cost (actually slightly less).The loom that both experienced weavers recommended, is called the ""Little Quick Weaver"", and is a mom and pop product made in Michigan.The craftsmanship, and finish of the ""Little Quick Weaver"" is superb!I am very glad that I solicited the advice of two weaving experts, prior to actually making a loom purchase.If you type ""Little Quick Weaver"" into a search engine, or go to Ebay, you will find the ""Little Quick Weaver"" listed for sale there.UPDATE: Nov. 19th, 2012: I can no longer find the ""Little Quick Weaver"" listed for sale ... anywhere.I would like to buy another one. If anyone can find it please advise me."
3,Toy? or Mess!,"I purchased the Easy Weaver A used for myself. Expecting it to be ready for weaving, the entire loom was a tangled mess. After untangling all the yarn and figuring out how to get it going took most of a day. It was a good thing that it was not purchased for a child. I was looking for something simple to learn weaving with and thought I would buy used.When it arrived, I was very disappointed. I believe that the seller had misrepresented the item by not declaring that someone had cut the yarn at the base creating the mess. And it was definitely a mess.Next time I will spend the extra to buy new."
4,not as good as the first.,"Not as good as the first. it is a bit more poppy with less if the ""im totally wasted"" feel to it.its worth 10 bucks."
4,Hit and miss,"Most of the songs on this album range from good to okay, my favorite being track 1 and track 6. And yes, I will concede that track 6 sounds nothing like any of their other stuff, but as far as I'm concerned it's still a slice of dance-pop heaven. Perhaps this album isn't as focused as the first one, but it's worth a listen if you're a fan."
3,Allstars - Lead Singer = Stereo MCs + Fatboy Slim,"It's true. Having lost the most unique aspect of their cadre, the lead singer & lyricist (Wrekked Train), the Allstars now sound like a combination of Fatboy Slim and the Stereo MCs. These are not bad influences by any means, and their comeback is respectable but not impressive. I personally enjoyed the dark yet subtle sci-if/fantasy motif of the lyrics on How to Operate With a Blown Mind, and don't ask me why, but I love snotty British vocals when done well. Also, the drum/beat work isn't as pronounced on this album. Sure it's more danceable, but that's merely because it's more 'generic' than before.Not a bad purchase though, especially if you like the above mentioned artists."
3,Not the best of Susan Matthews but an okay read.,Although this novel does stand on its own it does tie in with Ms Matthews's earlier novels with a brief appearance of the Fleet Inquisitor of several earlier novels. For fans of those early novels it is nice to have the tie.I don't think this novel is as exciting as some of Ms. Matthew's others but it is still a good read. It is also nice not to have the serious torture violence theme as in earlier novels.
4,good gift item for your co-workers,"The product is made in China. The physical appearance is very close to the picture. The surface is smooth and the color is even. The packaging is so-so (paper box and plastic wrapping). Overall, it is a good gift item."
5,love all of karens books.....,Every book Karen writes moves me with such passion she places in theses characters.....i could not place it down..and you know what ....it was my first book of hers I'd read...with that i became an instant fan....I could read this book over and over again....
3,Deceived by Title,"I ordered the book because I believed it to take place on the island of Malta. I found that the island referred to is ""Malata"", somewhere in the South Pacific.I doubt that the story was originally published with ""Malta"" in it's title. Publisher, please correct.(It is, however, an enjoyable novella.)"
5,Wow,"I thought ""Wild Wonderful Purgatory"" was a great record, but ""Almost Heathen"" is one of the 5 best albums of 2001 easily. Incredible rhythms, songwriting and guitar work. A must have for anybody who truly knows rock and roll."
4,Good instrumental riff-rock,"Funny how some people decide how rock music gets monotonous when the singer is taken out of the equation. Throw a singer in here and those people wouldn't know what to say. Sometimes I like my music to have no singer. A lot of times I wish some bands didn't have singers (Dream Theater for one. Just about any death metal band for another). Point is . . . KTB is good background music for whatever you might want to do. Its lively. Its crunchy. Its fun. Sounds like Kyuss, but not as good. Sounds vaguely like Clutch, as others have said, but nowhere near as good (speaking of singers you want in the equation). My 2 cents worth."
2,pointless and boring,"One of the reviewers got it right ( wish I had read his review instead of the more complimentary ones ). This is sooo monotonous, that it quickly becomes irritating.The STRIPPED AWAY comment is also spot on. I just don't think that this much stripping was really necessary. These guys are so STRIPPED BACK, they almost make AC / DC sound like PROG ROCK. Had there been some cool solos as well as a bit more variety, this cd could have been a winner. ALAS there are no guitar solos and every track follows the same insipid formula. I suspect that the monotony is largely due to the limits in their ability as musiscians."
2,BUy this if you like monotony,"This was recommended by others, but dont be fooled. This disk is as monotonous as it was uninspiring. If you took Slayer, slowed it down, stripped away the solos and lyrics, you would have this disk. Ech!"
3,Player only!,"I should have read more of the reviews....this is a player only. It says it has a screen, but it is not the screen for viewing the movies. You have to hook this up to a TV. It is cute though."
2,MISLEADING description!!!,"This item description is horrible! After seeing how cute it was and the price, I was sold! However, although the description states that this item plays cds/dvd ect. it DOES NOT state that you must have it hooked up to a television to hear/see them! The description calls the cd tray a ""screen"" which it is not. I refuse to put a tv in my daughters bedroom, so this item was sent back. Please change the description to reflect that this requires a tv so others are not mislead too!!"
1,Not happy,This piece of equipment came to me with something loose inside th player and stopped working on the fourth day i had it. The teturn policy says must be returned in same condition as received and i just didnt feel that they would believe it came to me broken after i had used it. However i will not shop with that company again
1,Great for 30 days...Then junk.,I have had this DVD player for less then 30 days and I now have to return it. It will no longer read the disks and makes a clicking sound.
2,will not purchase another one,This is the second one of these DVD players that we have ordered within only six months! The first one just stopped working all together. Would not read a DVD at all. The second one arrived and the front will not stayed closed. In order to play a movie we have to tape it closed with a strong piece of packaging tape. The DVD player is not worth the hassle of having to return or exchange it through the mail. For the time being we will put up with the tape and buy a better quality DVD player when this one stops working.
1,NOT HAPPY,"Not what i wanted,i wanted a portable dvd player for my granddaughter as a christmas gift. when i asked for a childrens,portable dvd player this is what appeared,so i ordered it.BIG disappointment she already has one that's attached to her t.v..i wanted something she could carry with her in her lap when riding in the car."
4,Missing parts!,This is a great little dvd player and my daughter loves it. Problem is it didn't come with the remote control that it was supposed to have and Amazon doesn't give us any way to get one... any ideas???
4,Good but not quite great album,"I'm a big fan of Charlie Parker's ""Bird with Strings"" album and was hoping for a similar experience here. While it's not anywhere near the classic status of Bird's record it's still a nice listen. There are times when it does feel a bit formulaic however. On a number of songs you'll hear the orchestra play their lead in part then Dizzy comes in the same exact way each song. This occurs for maybe about a 1/4 of the album. Beyond these intro's the music is great as are the arrangements. It's an overall mellow record with a slightly subpar sound quality. It's not terrible but it's definitely not up to the quality of many remasters from this era. I've come to expect this from these ""Jazz in Paris"" albums (see Chet Baker's).If you're looking for some classic jazz with orchestra, or more specifically trumpet you really can't go wrong with this album."
5,great alternative to ketchup,I love this product its a great alternative to ketchup for not adding more calories to your daily diet.
3,"Roses are Red, Violets are Blue, this Book is Gray","Hello! Well this book was ok, an average book. However, not being divorced myself I may not appreciate the wisdom here fully. I believe in life long commitments and I don't believe in easy divorce. But this is more about life AFTER divorce, for those of you who have been through divorce whether out of stupidity or wisdom, out of selfishness or generosity, evil or good. Here, you get some tips to get your life back together. Although the casual attitude toward sex in this book may be a reflection of its time (the eighties before AIDS and HIV). So folks, if you have been divorced and still feel like living this may make the rolling Sisiphus ball more bearable for you. I would put my own advice: Never take marriage casually."
1,silly me!,"I ordered this hub by looking at the picture, big mistake, The picture shows studs on hub but what I got was bolts. I guess I should have read product description which says hub kit with bolts. lining up bolts threw a rim is a pain. I have bolts on my trailer now , thats why I ordered this hub. silly me."
4,A man's betrayal,The drama A soldier's play was an amazing book. Which is about sergeant that betrayed his men that unlimitedly led to his death now Devenport which is a black lawyer has to come and sort out this mess with a racist captian Taylor on his back. The left my at the edge of my seat anxious to turn the next page. But the ending will left me asking for more
4,A Book That Must Be Read,"A Soldier's Play by Charles Fuller is a good book to read if you like suspense. I liked the book because it kept me interested in what was going to happen next. The book is based on the murder of Sergeant Waters, a black sergeant during World War II. During this time period racism was occurring and the Ku Klux Klan were very popular. When the other soldiers first learn of the murder they suspect the Ku Klux Klan. Captain Davenport is a black man sent to investigate the murder. Many people think he will not succeed because he would not get any cooperation from the white soldiers. Read A Soldier's Play and find out who murdered Sergeant Water. Who's the killer of the Sergeant, the Ku Klux Klan or the unexpected? Can Captain Davenport, a black man find the killer?"
5,George Foreman Big Grill,I am very pleased with the George Foreman Big Grill. I had a smaller George Foreman grill and when cooking food on it tasted great. So I wanted to upgrade to a larger grill. I highly recommend this product...
