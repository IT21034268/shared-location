2,It had maybe 2 good songs it gets tiresome,All the songs sound the same sho-nuff and tired of balling are decent but the rest of the album is lame. It's not worth buying.
3,GREAT FOR JUST LOUNGIN,THIS ALBUM IS ONE OF TELAS BEST I GAVE IT THREE STARS BECAUSE IT HAS ALWAYS BEEN MY FAVORITE.. HIS LYRICS AND BEATS MAKES FOR A PERFECT ALBUM FOR JUST CHILLIN... BUY IT
4,The best editing software at the lowest price,This product deserves alot of praise not only for the quality of its structure but for the price that it is sold at. The film industry has never been cheap and digital film has revolutionised its prices and this software is the perfect tool for the buget concious film-maker who has just started out. It is simple to use and offers scene shifting options with a very simple drag and drop method. This revolutionary new techique has halved the time it takes me to rearrange the sections of my film. This program also offers a proffesional quality that can only be rivalled by such software as Adobe Photoshop 0.6. This software is the only contender for quality and price in the market. I would recommend this product to anyone interested in film making both profesionally or just for fun.
2,how can they be out of tempo and out of tune?,"This cd made me wince and actually shudder.The instruments were not in tempo with each other or in tune. Perhaps that is why neither the name of the conductor nor the name of the orchestra is on the cd . Because I love Bach, it is usually wonderful to hear interpretations. But this reminds me of my days in high school orchestras on the days we had just recieved our music. Shocking. Why 2 stars? because Bach can never be given 1 star and his name is on the jacket. It actually hurt to listen to the first cd so bad that I have not listened to the second to protect myself. OUCH! Possibly useful as a reflective device to signal for help?"
1,Disappointed in you pulling back my selection to raise the price!,Your company is just wrong. I placed this order when the item was only $10.00 You pulled it back from my order now you have jacked up the price to cash in on the demand of fans wanting to collect Whitney items.You should have honored my order. That was just wrong!
4,I found it true to size,"I order a 3.5 xw for my son after reading the recommendation, but had to reorder a size 3 xw because they were to big. These shoes is well constructed and attractive but I find that the xw fits like a w."
1,Weak and unrealistic,Sorry. I was not in the least interested in the people and context of this story. It was more a list of tradenames of shopping articles which brainless rich girls were seeking to own.
4,Used Book,The book arrived in good condition and was exactly like the description. It came very quickly; it was a gift for a student who was leaving the area.
4,A Different Kind of Teacher,"My grandson, age 10, and I listened to the audio version of this book. He was excited to be ""reading"" about a teacher that was an alien. The story kept his interest, inspite of getting a bit garbled down with silly details. At times the story was delightful to listen to, and at other times a bit garbled and way too far fetched (in spite of the title). My grandson said that he would recommend the book to others, but it was not one of his top 5 favorite books."
1,This isn't my kind of book sorry but it's not realistic.,"The only thing I like about this story is when they were in the attic, and they found the sub.teacher. I didn't like Mr. Broxholm or the way he tried to hide the sub. in the attic.However, I didn't like the plot because I didn't think that anything like this could ever really happen."
3,Kayleigh's Rating,I think My Teacher is an Alien was sort of a good book. I suppose other 6th graders will like it. In the book Susan Simmons sees somthing weird with her new teacher Mr.Smith. So she goes to his house and sneeks around. She finds out he may be an Alien! Do you think it's a dream? You should find out by reading My Teacher is an Alien.
4,My Teacher IS an Alien,"I read this book, and it's great for anyone who like Science Fiction.It's about these kids who get a substitute teacher. One of the kids suspects the sub and sneaks into his house only to see him ""take off his face"" and reveal an ugly alien. The kid tells another kid and they sneak in again together only to see their REAL teacher (before the sub) in a forcefield, and the teacher tells the kids that the alien is going to kidnap some kids in THE kids class. get it? ok. great. that's all!"
5,MY TEACHER IS AN ALIEN is so good you have to read it!,The book MY TEACHER IS AN ALIEN is a good book because it uses expression. In the begining of the book Susan follows her teacher home to his house. Then Susan finds out a big secret that her teacher was an alien. The teacher is going to take some kids to outer space with him. You will have to read the book. It is great!
1,Don't Buy,"If you do construction work, do not buy this item. I bought it for my husband for Christmas and after two uses, the plastic latch broke. Returned it for a refund."
2,No longer a high quality belt,"I've been using a Bucket Boss Builders Rig for about 10 years now. I volunteer twice a week at Habitat for Humanity, so it gets pretty heavy use. The first belt I bought lasted me about 5 years. The second one lasted two and was made of different material. The third one has only lasted a few months and the bags are falling apart. The material isn't as stiff as it used to be, so my cats paw falls through it's holder. There are two holes in the other bag already too. While I've enjoyed using this light-weight belt, I'm now searching for a better built replacement because Bucket Boss has reduced the quality of the material to the point where it isn't a good purchase anymore."
2,Tool Belt Chinsy,The tool bags themselves are acceptable albeit a little thin . The tool belt which I thought from the picture had velcro padded wrap around with tool belt closure is actually a thin nylon strap with waist adjustment that required me to sew it to size and the plastic clasp does not easily stay closed . Had I known I definitely would have purchased another only slightly more expensive tool bag.
1,Belt comes unbuckled constantly,"The belt is light, padding is nice, but the buckle itself has started constantly coming unbuckled a lot on it's own while I'm moving around. I've not even used it much, and the plastic in the buckle has just become very flexible/weak, and now it just unbuckles itself making the belt unusableMy advice is to get a belt buckle with prongs (normal style tool belt), which wouldn't have this problem."
3,Tool belt is OK,"Love the concept of this belt. I am a framer by trade, but the hammer loop in the front is too small for my 19 ounce vaughn hammer. Tape measure holder is way too big too for my 25' tape measure. Everything else is great about it. I can fit squares and nails and everything else I need. It is also perfect to carry drills around with me."
1,Builders rig is awkward,"I am a carpenter, and have been for sixteen years. I have tried many different bag setups over the years, from front pouches, which I find convienient but very hot on my legs and dificult to walk with while wearing, to my favorite, two seperate bags sitting on the outside of my hips. The Builders rig bags are way too short, so they sit up at an awkward hight and the tool pouches on the inside of the big pouches get jambed up with fasteners. The entire set up is very awkward. Not what you want to deal with at work."
5,wonderful,everytime I play this CD....I feel the hot desert sands...long kool sensuous nites. It was all that I expected !
1,cheap,"For particle board cheap furniture, it's not bad, but this stuff isn't made to last. The finishes scratch easily. In the Bush manual it says, ""Customer service you can depend on."" When I sent an e-mail to the customer service address, it bounced with an error saying the recipient was invalid. So much for Bush customer service."
3,*shrug*,"The quality is ok. Good enough for what I need them for (clamping fluid lines, getting a better grip on small things, etc.), but not good enough quality for real surgery use, especially the defective ones. Not even sure how they'll hold up in an autoclave. You pretty much get what you pay for, defects and all.I ordered two 5"" curved halstead mosquito forceps, but received a 3"" one and a 5"" one. Not sure how that happened. It's fine with me though since that was what I had originally wanted.Also, one of the forceps was very assymetrical to the point that one end was a thin sharp point and the other end was thick and blunt. It's as if the machine didn't evenly split the end down the middle. I'll just need to be careful when using that pair so that I don't accidentally skewer something with the sharp end. The other forcep was fine and did not have this defect."
1,Don't Buy,"Don't buy the MacBook Pros. Here's my experience: I bought a MacBook Pro a few months ago and it was dead-on-arrival. I immediately had it replaced with my current MacBook Pro, which also turned out to be defective. I sent it in for repairs through my local Apple store to Apple's repair facility in Texas. Unfortunately for me, the defective part is the logic board (the motherboard on this notebook) and that part is on backorder, which I can only assume to be the case because of the demand for this part for other defective MacBook Pros. Apple's repair facility has had my notebook for more than four weeks now, and even after numerous phone calls to Apple's service center, I still don't have my notebook. My advice is to stay away from the MacBook Pros until Apple figures out why so many of them are unreliable (known problems include, but are not limited to, excessive heat and noise from the MacBook Pros). Just check Apple's official discussion forums and see for yourself."
2,Defective,"1) Two pixels in the screen burst;2) The computer is overheating;3) It is very slow and I cannot open two programs at the same time;4) There is a strange noise, possibly the cooler.Please adviseLuiz F. P. Braconnot"
2,nice computer....but very defective.,"I have already had to replace my battery (wouldn't sustain charge), power cord (burned out and no longer worked), and now the part where my headphones goes in has become loose and is pretty much unusable. All within four months of owning the thing. I like the computer...but man...it sure is made pretty crappy."
2,"Good optics, but touch activated switch bad","I bought this for my girlfriend. It has very clear optics on the regular and magnified sides. The light is not really very powerful, but OK. The main problem is that after it was plugged in for a week it just started turning on and off by itself. Had to unplug it, what good is that?"
5,A fantastic opera and recording,"This recording revels all the dramatismo and power of this Giordanos'opera. Mario del Monaco is a passionate Andrea, his voice express the impetuous poet. Renata Tebaldi interprests with mastery and intense dramatism the role of Maddalena.Deserves prominence Fiorenza Cossotto as the courageous Bersi.A memorable recording!"
3,Good for staging,"These are great for staging and do the job. Would not use for sleep, purely decoration. Fits perfectly."
1,Cigarette and cologne smell,"These pillows arrived unwrapped, stuffed bare naked into a box. They smelled like some guys cologne and cigarettes.The stuffing is 95% feathers and 5% down. I did not find the stuffing anemic, like another reviewer said, but the cotton case is loud when you touch it, which makes me wonder if it is indeed 100% cotton."
1,They're PAPER thin,"I don't know how anyone has said they are happy with these. I didn't know I needed to watch out for 22 inch pillows stuffed with half of the feathers. I was so excited by the good deal but they're worthless to me. I have 19 inch pillow covers that I wanted stuffed nice and full. I thought 22 inch inserts should do the trick! But these come as a huge flat square. I fluffed and fluffed hoping eventually they'd turn out normal. I can make the pillow look decent sitting on the couch until someone leans on it a teenie bit and then it looks like a limp, mis-shapen mess. I've never take the time to review an item on here. But this was a big bummer to me."
4,exktra pillows,I am very pleased with my purchase of these pillows. They are serving their purpose for my extra bedrooms for visitors.
3,It's not firm,"This two feather Euro shams look as if they were firm, but no.. they are too wiggly! For this price it could have been better!!!"
2,Smelly Down pillows,These Pillows are under stuffed and smell terrible. I had to remove them from my room. Unhappy with these pillows.
4,basic info,"There's hardly any details here so: this CD is evidently a 14 track studio mix set.I still haven't heard it yet, but I had to look up whether this was a single or not and figured I'd spare everyone else the same trouble."
3,Very Dancey,I like it but it follows Fatboy's live shows and leans towards a dance side. Different from his studio stuff but still good.
5,excellent collection of essays,"If you're looking for a great and eclectic collection of essays, look no further. I've looked at and taught from a lot of them, and this is my favorite. Broadview is a relatively small and sympathetic press that publishes great books in an attractive format--something about the paper, the feel of the book, appeals to me.The selection is wonderful and gives you all the coverage you'd like, with great variety to race, gender, political perspective, and origin; the short questions after every selection work really well for journal entries, class discussion, or just private food for thought. What's perhaps more important, the book doesn't go overboard like a lot of textbooks that want to give you thousands of pages of stuff to have to choose from, or lengthy theoretical sections on how to read that everyone skips anyway. Broadview, in my mind, got it just right--and at a pretty good price too."
1,I misunderstood.,I don't hate the movie I tried to order a DVD and I misunderstood what video meant. I do not have the ability to download it.
1,Scottish Haggis,I had this particular brand of Haggis before and my husband and I really enjoyed it. I was so happy to find it again on-line. I ordered four cans for him for Christmas and he was thrilled to get it. Looking forward to some good dinners in the coming year.
4,Burns Night,Good for 2 years of Burn's Night and throw in some Scotch and bagpipes and your good for the evening.
3,Haggis in a can..... can't expect it to be the very best......,"This haggis order arrived today. I prepared it and well ...... I have had good haggis and I have had really awful haggis. This haggis is center good bad. Of course it's not going to be what you'd get if you were in Scotland. If you are sodium sensitive or on a sodium restrictive diet this is not the haggis for you. It is salty to the taste. It has 480 mg of sodium; maybe because it is in a can and needs a preservative to prolong shelf life, the salty taste can be a bit overwhelming. I can't give it a rave review. It's okay. If you are going to eat haggis, don't get it in a can....."
4,Scotish Haggis,"I'm not an expert, but this is comparable to haggis I tried on the Isle of Skye. Incidentally, true haggis includes lungs and other organs excluded from this U.S. recipe. Anyhow, forget trying to bring haggis into US. Your friendly 9mm-carrying Customs people will confiscate it. Local shipment was prompt."
5,"A braw, braw Haggis","Well, his honest sonsie face, was a bit dull due to being tinned and not in the traditional stomach pouch, and of course his hurdies were hardly like a distant hill for the same reason. But, I wielded the knife with rustic Labour dight, as you might expect and cut him up wi' ready slight and was impressed with gushing entrails bright, and best of all, a glorious sight, warm, reekin' , rich.I would say if anyone that owre his French ragout, or olio that wad staw a sow, or fricassee wad mak her spew wi perfect scunner, could possible look down wi sneering, scornfu view on this particular haggis. :)With my sincere apologies to Robert Burns. This was a fine haggis and I recommend it."
4,excellent use of body image metaphor and description,"While I agree with the above review which finds fault with some of the ""mawkishness"" of the novel, I find its metaphorical rhythm redeems it. Levin uses physical description and body image literalness and metaphor better than most any other writers. In fact, it is unusual to read a novel that cares so much about the body in all its aspects. And, she does not focus on the cultural icons of the woman's body, but broadens and deepens our relationship to the characters' physicality, and our own. Worth reading for that aspect alone. Also a good plot."
5,Hauntingly heroic!,I've read this book 3 times since I first bought it and every time leaves me with a feeling both sad and joyful for Babe's life. I recommend this book highly.
5,Fantastic performer,"I went to see her in Los Angeles in 2007 and this was hands down, the best concert I've ever been to. Her voice was in top-notch condition and the show was fun and reminded me of one of the old 1940's MGM hollywood musicals. Back to Basics is one of my all-time favorite albums and the show exceeded my expectations!"
5,AWESOME CONCERT,The sole purpose of me buying this DVD was because I actually went to this tour show 2 years ago...in BMORE...and it was AWESOME!!!!!Christina has an amazing voice...and I will tell anyone to purchase this DVD but if you ever get a chance to see her live...GO....Hearing her live is amazing...she has such a powerful voice and that is why besides Beyonce she is in my top 5 singers of all times right now
2,Very poor editing and camera work,"I enjoyed the concert and Christina's performance, but I though much of the concert was very poorly filmed and the spazmatic editing was very hard to take. It made enjoying the concert very difficult.The video framing was very poor with terrible zooming that made no sense. The half-second camera angle changes compounded the issue as did the very poor editing."
1,Highy disappointed! Won't recommend!,"I did not entertained when I bought this DVD. AT ALL.It sucks, and absolutely boring. Her songs all very emo! and makes me sleepy. All she does is screaming, yelling, screeching, straining her fcukin' voice. ALL THE TIME. So annoying. How is that ""VOICE of the generation"". She can't even control and runs her own voice. Her vocal runs technique is horrible and Xtina falsetto control are laughable compared with Beyonce. LMAO. And tell Xtina don't ever try to move or dancing cause she look retarded doing it. Thanks.Go buy the new Beyonce Experience and Justin's concert DVD instead. They both the best entertainers right now and will entertain you in every possible way. If you buy this, don't get mad at me, cause I've warn you, it will disappoint you. Unless you a REALLY obsessed fans of Xtina who don't care if she sucks at live or anything, then buy this. This is not a real show. Even Britney Onyx Hotel DVD show much better than this."
2,Nonbelievers beware,"An inetersing DVD which attempts to look into many different aspects of UFO's, from sightings to abductions. It also has so called secret reports, which sound intersting, but don't seem to be believable to anyone except true believers. If you are interested in UFO's this DVD may be interesting, but if you are looking for an athority source, look elsewhere"
4,Self Reflection,"i had the priveledge of meeting the author of this book before reading it. she indicated that the book was about ""her life"" , so i expected an autobiography of sorts. however, upon reading the acknowledgements,the dedication, the foreword and the completion of chapter 1, it is fair to say that her story, written in novel form, could easily be about my life, my grandmothers life, my mama's life,my husband's life, my neighbors life, your life, your mama's life ,your aunties life,your neighbors life, the women on the other side of the world, etc, etc,etc. the subtitle explains that this book addresses verbal, mental and emotional abuse. the contents forces you to take a look at yourself, and to tear down the walls of silence that will eventually lead you to a life of freedom and self preservation. a must read book if you're stuck in the middle, not knowing which way to go.an excellent read if you're trying to help someone else who is."
3,Good Book for Eberron Players,"I first tried reading this novel years ago when the D&D; game world of Eberron was first published and just couldn't get through it. However I recently joined my first Eberron based D&D; campaign and decided to give it another try. With a bit more knowledge about the game world this time, the novel was much more enjoyable.I also have to mention one of the main characters, Daine. When I first tried the book he seemed kind of annoying, a poor leader and worse fighter (he practically loses his sword in every fight). The second time around though I found him to be much more entertaining. A sort of everyman who is in over his head but doesn't know how to quit."
3,Nice First Effort,"I went into this book expecting decent things, not great things, and was given something that lived up to this billing. The story is interesting enough, and I'm sure my major complaint, of the most likable character being offed, will be reversed in the sequel books. I think 3 stars is just about right, maybe 3.5 since it is a completely new universe, albeit one that the author created himself."
4,Good start,"This book is very useful if you are working on a campaign in Eberron for D+D, whether you are a player or DM. It helps to set the scene and give a clear idea as to the flavor of this newest Dungeons and Dragons world. The story was not amazing, but it reads almost like an adventure would if you were following the characters along as they made their decisions. Which, I suppose, was sort of the goal. It was a quick read, and a good bit of fun! Nothing too complex, and not tons of character development, but fun nonetheless. It truly serves to paint the backdrop of Sharn, the City of Towers very clearly. i would recommend it to anyone who wants to explore this world without spending an arm and a leg.I agree with the earlier review about typos and grammatical errors. This book is rife with them for some reason. So roll with it and stumble past them as you follow the characters through their story."
2,So-So,"This book was a definite ""so-so.""First, the book has a lot of references to the Eberron setting. While this is a good thing if you've played and are familiar with the setting, it can be a huge turn off if you are not.Second, the amount of typos and grammatical errors is unacceptable and very distracting. Is WotC releasing books w/o proofreading/editing first?Third, the characters are a bit shallow (or at least the description thereof). They have no depth.Fourth, the plot is predictable and very linear.Fifth and lastly it overuses tired and shameless cliches.It's not a bad book, to be sure, but it's not nearly as good as I was expecting."
2,Awesome World Building,"I read this book without any prior knowledge of this author's world. And though I agree with previous reviews about the characters not being fleshed out very well, I was impressed with the imagination behind the setting.And the story moved along well enough and was involving enough, that I wasn't as bothered by the lack of character development that I otherwise would have been. I don't think I'd read another book in this series though, as good as the world building was."
4,Surprisingly fun first outing...,"Despite having been a gamer for decades, I generally avoid RPG-based novels like the plague, just because as a rule they're simply awful. However, I've been reading up on Eberron preparatory to starting a campaign, and decided to pick this upon a lark, just for background noise, and was very pleasantly surprised. Not exactly Lord of the Rings, of course, but really a remarkably fun and surprisingly well written fantasy with mystery overtones. Especially remarkable in that it's the first novel by Keith Baker, creator of the Eberron game world. Reasonably complex plot, nice characterizations, good description without being overly wordy, a nice quick read. Genuinely worth a look, and I look forward to checking out its sequels."
3,City of Towers Review,This wasn't too bad of a book. It's about what you'd expect from a novel based on an RPG. It's a good introduction to Eberron and the author showing what it's like to adventure in this setting.All I can say is thank God that annoying halfling is dead.
4,Great read!,This reads like a historical novel set in a fantasy world. Every page seems to turn another interesting corner....
1,Presto-Crapo!,"It's official! Wizards of the Coast opened a fresh page, squatted over it, and squeezed out the first book set in the gameworld called Eberron. I bought this book just to see if my world (which I didn't have the stones to submit) would have competed. Indeed, it would not have--it was a full five grade levels above it! But please, don't take my word for it--don't EVER take ANYONE'S word for it. If Jesus Christ himself said, ""thou shalt not read this book, it sucketh greatly"" read it anyway, just so you know for a fact how bad it is. I'm only writing this review to vent over my lost $7. Pay no attention to the man behind the curtain."
1,I can't believe this woman was an English teacher,"I was very excited about reading this book based on the review and when I finally got it, I was just so disappointed. It is terribly written (i.e. ""The Zuni Cafe is cool""). The meanderings bore me to tears and after three chapters, she still hasn't had a date. Her descriptions are cliched and there is nary a complete sentence in the book. I can hardly believe people are raving. I just don't get it. I give her credit for placing the ad and pursuing her dreams (or fantasies as the case may be), but that's about the only positive thing I can say about Round Heeled Woman."
3,An Un-Healed Woman: Her Late-Life Attempt to Overcome Abuse,"The writing is lovely. There are numerous finely observed scenes and the narrator is witty and amusing. However, Jane routinely drinks until she passes out, leaving her little boy alone, (ok people get a clue here, this is NOT NORMAL unless your idea of normal is nightly AA meetings)and also, Jane has been sleeping with her daddy for years. So, um folks, where does all of the praise for fulfilling elder-sex figure in here? This isn't some rolicking memoir of senior citizen happy hook-ups, this is a really sad story about a chick who needs serious counseling for substance abuse and childhood incest. I gave it three stars because Jane is a likeable heroine and you want her to win and to find her soul mate, but yeesh, she needs to kick the liquor addiction and Daddy-O, too. Lots of mixed messages in this slick package."
2,We Need to Value Ourselves More Than This Woman Values Herself,"I heard Jane Juska speak at an Author's Luncheon. She was fresh, funny and had great comedic timing. She was the hit of the event. So I bought her book with anticipation of more of the same. What a surprise! Yes, the comedic talent was still there but in small doses. What predominated was the portrait of a woman of little self-esteem, often of self-loathing, whose graphic descriptions of sex had little in the way of sex appeal. My mother who is 89 wants to read the book but I will warn her that, in the end, it is not an illuminating experience. And all of the men Jane has sex with are also having or recently have had sex with other women. What about the possiblity of STD's? No mention is made of taking precautions or of ""safe sex."" I hope all of us can move into our late-life years enjoying rewarding sexual relationships. But not at the risk of disease or damage to our self-worth or a suspension of our hard won values."
2,eh,"The idea is good, my problem is with the narrator. Juska is SO pretentious I can't stand it. She only goes out with the most erudite of men, then is disapointed when they turn out to be cads. How about opening yourself up to all types of men Jane? She thinks she's being young and hip by using words like ""cool,"" but you can see through the attempt. The writing often meanders on topics that HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH the personal ad. She is very naive trusting complete strangers when they tell her they have no std's. I don't know...I just found her annoying, naive and pretentious. Yeah, so she's over 60 and has sex. Woo-hoo."
1,Tedious and unpleasant,"Spare yourself this grindingly tawdry recounting of Ms. Juska's tedious, unpleasant encounters with tedious, unpleasant men. Far from being what her ad claims she wanted -- ""a lot of sex with a man I like,"" which sounds frisky and appealing -- it's actually a dreary tome primarily detailing two things: her unbelievable neediness and her nauseating tendencies to sweat, drip, ooze and otherwise leak under her politically correct drab Berkeley costumes. These absolutely endless descriptions are intercut with pompous philosophizing about Trollope and Bach and self-congratulatory droning about her work with prisoners.I feel sorry for the editor assigned to work with this tripe, oddly sympathetic to the poor men she hounded, and angry with myself for being stupid enough to buy this book."
2,disappointing,"What a great idea for a novel! When I started reading this book it reminded me of Anne Tyler's writing, with great, off-center characters who find themselves at small, turning points in their lives.Alas, the characters end up being shallow and uninteresting, and the story goes nowhere. It is mildly humorous at times, but overall, sad and empty.Such great potential here, squandered."
3,"Great premise, falls a little short on the execution","This book is advertised in a scintillating way: the late-life adventures in sex and romance of an English teacher who placed an ad in the NY Review of Books seeking to ""have a lot of sex with a man I like"" before she turns 67. The result had an identity disorder: Is this book a whirlwind of sexual escapades (as advertised)? Is it Juska's depressing memoirs, describing her failed marriage and her relationship with her son? It is a commentary on modern relationships? Each ensuing chapter pulls the reader in a different direction, detracting from the book as a whole.The sexual meetings were, frankly, boring. Give me Noelle Howey or Augusten Burroughs for sexual deviation any day. Also, Juska talked a lot, but never really let the reader inside her head. I never figured out why she was with Robert if he treated her so poorly, and she didn't explain her rationale."
2,The tale of a woman who still needs to find herself,"The hype released for this book was not honest. The writer who suffered much abuse and trauma does not become the free, sexual competent woman of the ads. She still lets herself be used by the jerks she choses to hop into bed with and from all the evidence in the book, is not really enjoying herself.She had made gains in losing weight and improving her self image, but she is by no means a model of a self assured, in control woman.Unfortunately, she has many sisters in this world."
5,Fun with Jane and dicks?,"So older women are sexy too? Thank goodness! What a great read from and of a fabulous dame. I guess others would call her a lady (yes, she is certainly that), but she is a lot more than a prim grandma type. And she writes beautifully. Thanks, Jane, for letting us come along for the ride. Great read."
3,I'm going to be that old someday and ...,"... I hope I'm better than the men this author met.Jane Juska's book about a woman suddenly deciding at 67 that ""she's just gotta have it"" is a hoot. Unfortunately, all the men she meets that are any where near her age let her down - one way or another. I would think that a woman with so much bravado would fare better. But then she hits the jackpot with a younger lover. So simultaneously you think, hurray for her but what's his problem."
3,Very witty but at times...depressing,"I enjoyed reading Jane Juska's book - love her wit and as a former teacher, I laughed at some of the antics in her classroom.BUT - what I found ironic was that as much as she was so apt to help the ""greater good"" i.e. volunteering at Planned Parenthood and at the prison, she overlooked the well-being of her SELF (dealing with alcoholism & weight issues) and her OWN SON. Typical of those who claim ""world peace"" and ""helping others"" - they neglect to find peace within themselves and in their households.The other ironic thing from the book is that the most mature of all the men she encountered was Graham - the 33 year old. So much for the ""maturity"" and ""wisdom"" of older men!At the very least she had some adventures in New York - THAT was the most valuable part of the book."
4,A good read,"This was eye-opening and fun to read. Ultimately a bit sad that she was hurt so often and didn't seem to find what she wanted, but a very interesting book. I enjoyed it and recommended it to a few older single women I know."
1,The Jane Contradiction: Great Sex With Young Lovers Only,"The premise of Jane Juska's book is that the elderly can enjoy sex too. Then she writes about her disappointing rendezvous with men her age. Her only enthuisiastic encounter was with a man substantially younger than she. The real message from Juska is that old people may engage in sexual activity, but if you are elderly and want great sex, get a young lover. What a disappointing book.... especially if you are elderly and can't find a young lover !!!!"
2,Very Sad,"Despite her feminist/liberal bleatings, Juska ends up sounding like a 14 year old girl pining away for true love. I ultimately found this book very sad. Her journey starts out interesting and beguiling, but midway through I found her pretentious, shallow, and horribly co-dependant. That she hadn't changed a bit by the end left me feeling cheated and irritated."
2,Okay.,I bought this book after reading the article about the author in Vogue Magazine. I didn't expect the author to be so slutty; I was embarrassed for her and hope other women don't act that stupid around men.
1,Dumb as a Box of Rocks,"This author just never got over her father. Because she lives her life exactly in opposition to what he expected of her, does not mean she won the game. At the ripe age of 67 she decides that sex will cure her past problems; i.e., bad decisions re lovers and husband, inability to raise her son and frightened of living by herself. Only an old hippie would pop into bed with men she really knows nothing about. She rants on about ""talk"" but thinks mainly about getting it on. Silly book."
3,A Round Heeled Woman,This was a somewhat interesting book about a woman's sexually exploits with different men that she met via a personal ad. She's not too smart for having one-night stands with people she hardly knows - like the thief - but she got a book deal out of it!
2,I don't get it,"Jane Juska decided to have a lot of sex with strange men before she turned 67. Luckily, she didn't run into a Ted Bundy or a Mr. Goodbar type. That's it. That's the book. One sexual romp after another. This book has been highly praised as being bold and empowering but it just struck me as being rather sad. It's better written thant the Sexual Life of Catherine M. but that's the best that be said for it."
2,"Fact, Fantasy, or Fiction",I am not at all sure where this book should go. If it is true the main problem she seems to be left with is cutting love out of the situation. It is also interesting that she attempts to transfer the reason for her mental situation on a handyman and her father.
3,A remarkably cold book,"After reading this unusual and rather cold book I had the very strong feeling that the author doesn't really understand men at all and makes very little attempt to do so. The very premise of the book -- woman advertises for sexual partners to quickly help break decades of self-imposed celibacy -- to me at least shows clearly that her prospective partners are little more than lumps of meat and this is how the book turns out. Yes, she does feel more fond of some lovers than others, and she shows us how clearly she appreciates deep intellectual conversations, but at the end of the book I can't help thinking that despite putting all these various males under the microscope, she doesn't have much luck finding out what makes them tick. For me the highlight of the book was the passages on her teaching career and what makes a good teacher, in part because it was the one time when she showed real emotion and passion about the topic at hand."
3,Jerry Springer for English Majors,"How does a person write a revealing memoir like this and still have the guts to go out in public? A Round-Heeled Woman reads like a personal diary. So I have to hand it to Juska, it took courage to publish this book.I was expecting a light-hearted memoir of adventures and misadventures in dating, with the twist being that the heroine is 67 years old. This memoir is occasionally light-hearted, but more often depressing, when Juska reminisces about her lonely childhood, or her even lonelier marriage. And when she starts dating again, after placing the personal ad, well, sometimes, I just wanted to shake her. She goes out with a series of men who are unsuitable in one way or another. Married, bonkers, or just plain cads. But she gives every one a chance and then some.A Round-Heeled Woman is like watching Jerry Springer (but with an English degree), and I have no one to blame for reading it all the way through except myself. I just couldn't look away."
3,49 and single,"and have tried online dating so I was interested in what the author had to say. The book was more about her and not so much about her sexual encounters. More about life as a single 60+ woman. It was amusing, sad, enlightening, entertaining. I passed it on to a 60+ (married friend) she also read it in less than 5 days. I would purchase another book by this author. I see she is now writing articles for Match.com."
4,fascinating book---but,"fascinating, good writer in a modern style, but why have all the women who shouted great and wonderful not mentioned the troubled relationships with not only the father and husband other lovers but mostly a son who ran from her to the streets of s.f. as a very young teen and continued to prefer that life to one with his mother...bill krause"
2,Doesn't deliver,"The writer of this book placed an ad in her sixties, searching for a lot of sex with a man she liked. She got many responses and travelled across the country to meet these men and have sex with some of them. However, only a small portion of the book was devoted to the actual premise of the book. Most of it was flashbacks to her teaching years, her students, her love of Bach, etc., most of which I found quite boring. I love to read but found myself skimming through all of this to get to the actual heart of the book, the journey, the men. And even here she skimped. She didn't develop the men well enough, didn't develop her time with them well enough. I felt she missed her goal and this book was a waste of time."
3,Sex As Bait...,"...never works unless of course, you're getting paid. What Jane needs is love; rather, men who are loving - and that my dear, comes at a price. Rule #1: You have to be loving too. Here is another woman who, again, confuses sex and love. Rule #2: You really have to know the difference. Why does it seem men have little trouble separating the two? Not that there is not valid reason for Jane's addiction (excuse me, confusion)and, as she comes to this realization, one is rooting for her to truly ""get real."" If anything, that is the value of reading this book. Still, I enjoyed it, in parts, and give her scads of credit for finally getting on the path to finding herself."
3,"Frank, but not appealing","I rather liked her candid frankness about her search for sex, but was put off that she seemed to confuse sex with love. As the adventures and soul-searching went on, I kept thinking, ""OH, grow up!"" That said, I DID read the whole book, and the sequel. So they are readable. Maybe it was fun to read about a woman my age and her life."
2,SOLO Liquid Sprayer,"Missing parts, nut and bolt to keep cup in place at bottom of sprayer, Where is QA?The rest of it is OK except that one of the most important things in a backpac sprayeris the sholder slings and these are very poor.You corporate fools need to produce QUALITY PRODUCTS to sell your products!"
3,Not as easy as I thought,"I love that I only have to fill my sprayer once or twice to do the entire yard. And I love that I don't have to use one arm to carry a heavy tank. However, it is difficult to get on my shoulders when it's resting on the ground and it's not the best balanced on the ground with the hose and pump sticking out all over the place. Would have been nice if it had some kind of handles or straps to lift it off the ground and put it on a table so that I can get it on my back. It's too heavy when it's filled to sling it over my shoulders like a back pack. The little plastic clip that holds the shoulder strap to the tank broke the first time I tried that. Would also be nice if the hose didn't get stuck under the stand when trying to put it on the ground.Once I have the tank filled and on my back the rest is duck soup, except that it leaks from the pressure gauge. I have yet to figure out how to fix that and think I'll be calling the manufacturer. Not sure if this is a defect or not."
5,Good technical bridge defense book,"A great book for defense technical tactics.Whereas most books strive for various common strategic defensive situations, this book is different. It strives to give you and your partner the best agreements of when to signal attitude, count, and suit preference. I learned several things I didn't know before, and I've been playing this game for over 40 years. Great on opening lead conventions, signals, and a lot of rules of thumb about when to cover and when not to, which is great because you need to do these things quickly and in tempo. This book will improve the bridge defense of virtually every player out there."
5,Great Teacher,"Kantar today is more noted as a bridge instructor than a bridge player. But one must remember that he is both and his latest book demonstrated both the instructional and practical sides. It is (as usual) clear, concise and ro the point. I like Kantar's prose, his ease of explanation and the way he sets just the right tone. Of course, he discusses the bid, the opponent and, most important, keeping track of the play while counting the cards (the one thing that separates the professional from the amateur). Good book with tons of examples."
3,"Great slice of 80s nostalgia, would have liked some extras!","Who was a teen in the 80s and did NOT feel an impact of this movie? Whether you liked or hated this film, it was one of the key examples of the unique mixture of music and movies that we saw in the 80s.Why just 3 stars, then? One complaint is that the music track does not play well on the DVD. This could just be my copy, and I was too lazy to try to return through Amazon to see if I just got a bad disc.The main reason is LACK OF EXTRAS! If a studio is going to re-release a movie on DVD and charge over $15 for it, there should be plenty of extras. How about the original music videos, or a documentary on dance in the 80s - especially breakdancing which had one of its first broad/public exposures in this film? Even interviews with cast/crew on the making of the film and the hype after its release? Something could have and should have been done.Almost exact same comments for Footloose, so you don't have to read that review, too."
5,Great movie to put you in a good mood,"If you are feeling low, watch this movie. It will leave you feeling terrific. I wish it was available on DVD, I would purchase it again. It is also a very SEXY movie but done it good taste. Flashdance is so much better than Dirty Dancing."
5,Yes! Special features now!!!,Great movie! Great sound! Anamorphic (enhanced for widescreen TVs) and special features too! This special collector's edition fills the widescreen TV screen at 1.78:1 for those of you who care about this kind of stuff.Awesome DVD.
3,"Total BS, but great music","ok ok this movie had great music and the dancing was the real star. I remember seeing this movie with my mother, who was a real construction worker. we both laught. No way she could do construction all day and dance all night, but its a movie right. Jennifer Beals was so hot when she did this movie, why didn't she do more films? Oh yeah, she can't act to save her life, but never mind that lets get back to the dancing. The Choreography was so cutting edge for the 80's. If you can choke down the bad acting and the weak story this is not such a bad film. If you like good dancing,and some of the best 80's music see it."
2,OK if you miss the early 80s,"Flashdance, supposedly inspired by a real-life welder-turned-dancer, comes off as a pretty lame flick, but it does bring back my fond memories of the early 80s. The story itself is predictable, uninspiring, and ends too abruptly. The dance numbers are ok, nothing extraordinary, although the girls do have beautiful legs. To be honest I found the movie boring. Jennifer Beals's interracial beauty was about the only thing that allowed me to finish watching the movie.The DVD is enhanced for 16:9 widescreen and preserves the film quality pretty well. The audio is too loud on music and too soft on dialogs. It doesn't have any extra features. But then, for $12, you get to watch some 80s dancing and some strip club scenes and relive the go-go days, so what more can you ask for?"
2,average,not much of a film now.very slick&shallow.very much a 80's film.the music was catchy.but the film is very dated now.it was average at the time.and hasn't changed.
2,"Loved the music, Hated the movie!!","It's been a while since I had the chance to see this movie again as my wife ordered the DVD. I didn't like the movie when it first came out and I didn't like it now. It's mostly because of the lowsy script by Joe Esterhaus. Jennifer Beals was a so-so actress. But I thought they would have done better if they had a dancer who could act (i.e. Leslie Caron). The only thing going for it is the music. If you like dancing, this is for you. If you want a spectacular movie, look elsewhere!"
2,The dog sells out.,"Flash -- yes. Dance -- well, only if it's still the 80's. It's all about selling yourself -- on the job; in the audition. The only character with any integrity is the dog. And, in the end, even he ends up with the greaseball. What's with that ribbon? MADD?"
5,80's Flashdance flashback is great fun,"This movie is probably considered a chick flick, but it's more than that. It has great music and really fun dance scenes. The 2 plots lines are very good. First where she is trying to get in to a serious dance school and second, her romance with the rich boss. You can't go wrong with this 80's flashback. It's really good fun."
1,Never received the item,Unfortunatelly I am still waiting for this item.I don't know what can I do to get refouded since the item never got to me.
1,STREET/BOOTLEGED QUALITY COPYING:BLURRY/HISSING THRU MOVIE & VILE ETHNIC STEREOTYPING IS DESPICABLE/PROFANE/UPSETTING - UGLY,"HORRIBLE ETHNIC STEREOTYPING IS DATED AND VERY DISTURBING. WITH TODAY'S STANDARDS, THE SOUND AND PICTURE QUALITY ARE, JUST, HORRIBLE. NOT RIGHT FOR TODAY - SEEMS LIKE A REAL LOSER WITH TODAY'S STANDARDS IN TECHNOLOGY AND DECENCY. DON'T BOTHER. WATCH FOOTLOOSE OR SAT NITE FEVER.HAS A VERY DATED AND BOOTLEGGED 50'S HORRIBLE QUALITY AND HISSING/SKIPPING THROUGHOUT.AGAIN, THE VILE BIGOTED AND RACIST STATEMENTS WILL MAKE ANY DECENT PERSON VERY UNCOMFORTABL.WILL DEFINATELY UPSET FRIENDS AND RELATIVES AND MAKE YOU LOOK VERY STUPID AND INSENSITIVE.STEREOTYPING AND ETHNIC BASHING IS VERY WRONG.HOWEVER IF YOU ARE A MEMBER OF THE KKK OR SKINHEADS; THIS MAY BE OF YOUR MENTALITY.ISN'T THERE ENOUGH HATE IN THE WORLD?!"
5,Love It,"In addition to loving the DVD, I love the music and the dancing in the movie and recommend it highly."
5,SEX!,I'm a guy.I like girls.I like rock 'n' roll music.This show has it all!I recommend it for guys like me.
3,It's Alright But It's Not All That,"I came across this interesting tidbit about ""Flashdance"":""Not all of the dance scenes for Jennifer Beals (I) were performed by Marine Jahan. The scene where she auditions and does the spin on the floor was actually performed by a male breakdancer from New York.""A male bodydouble for a female dancer? In a *nationwide* search, you couldn't find at least one pretty young woman who could act *and* dance? Anyway, the movie is enjoyable due mainly to the dancing. Other than the that, it's kind of cheesy and there are too many gaps in it. It's not as cheesy as ""Honey,"" though, and I do have to give Jessica Alba props for doing her own dance numbers. And in case you're wondering, yes, Pittsburgh was really that dirty in 1983 and it's still dirty in 2005. Avoid this dirty, boring place like the plague."
4,Great movie from the 80s,I'll just say the music helped a lot to make this movie great. If it wasn't the for the music the movie probably would be nothing. I mean great dancing definitly at the end. The end of the movie is probably my favorite part out of the whole movie.
2,What a feeling....not!,"I tried numerous times to like this '80s classic but I can't. Flashdance has a weak plot, bad and I mean BAD acting from Jennifer Beals, the only thing that saves this train wreck is the dancing. I give two stars for the hot as fire dancing and the soundtrack, otherwise than that, Flashdance is just too flashy for me."
5,Wonderful!,"This is a fantastic movie. The dancing is great, and Jennifer Beals does an incredible job. She is both beautiful and convincing in this role. When I was in Pittsburgh a few years ago, I actually saw a few of the places where this movie was filmed. This was one of the best movies of the 80's!"
5,Classic Movie. Still great after all these years!!!!,"Yes, I am a child of the 80's, so I am partial to this movie along with many other 80's movies as well, but I will say that this movie is one of the most memorable movies of it's time, and has stood the test of time well.It is still popular today with people of all ages.Jennifer Beals was HOT! Every guy I knew dreamed of being with her, and she made her mark with this movie.I totally recommend this movie to anyone, and it is truly one of the great movies.People still talk about it today!!!The dance scene at the end was incredible!!!"
4,musical inspiration,I remember when a group of friends went to see this film.... our lives changes (musicaly speaking)... Please realise it in DVD format! (excuse my english...I dont speak english everyday)
2,Too late.,"Houston Person is fine on reeds and Etta has her moments- my favorite her scatting on ""Orange Colored Sky"". But her wobbly vibrato and loss of upper range have already turned her into a limited singer. Listen to her Prestige recordings to get the real thing."
1,how about a little information?,"""product details"""" doesn't even include song titles?!how should anyone decide whether to buy this particular recording?i had to click on a star in order to submit comments."
3,Slow,"Fanny Crosby, the hymn writer, led a fascinating life. It's a shame this production makes it seem so boring. The production moves at a glacial pace. I would compare it to a 45-minute version of the film ""The Greatest Story Ever Told,"" which took the incredible life of Jesus and made it seem dull. Snappier editing and more upbeat narration would have been very helpful. Unfortunately this seems to be the only filmed version of this lady's remarkable life that is available. I would recommend a rental from Netflix rather than a purchase, unless you have a very specific purpose for owning a copy of this product."
5,Good DVD - True Account,"This dvd comprises facts about Fanny Crosby's early childhood, adult salvation experience and service to her Lord and mankind. It includes information about her marriage, child, and God-given skill to write an amazing collection of treasured hymns, many of which are memorialized in church music."
3,1950 hard blow,"This is a hard blowing bop session from 1950 propelled along by the driving drums of Art Blakey and featuring Stan Getz pre ultra-cool. The sound quality isn't perfect but it is certainly very listenable and very enjoyable. The band never lets up and the energy is high as they hit 'That Old Black Magic', 'Half Nelson' and more with JJ Johnson offering a couple of nimble trombone solos alongside the young Miles' straight ahead blowing. This is worth having in the collection alongside your 'Birth Of The Cool' and all the rest. In fact, just today I played 'The Birdland Sessions' (twice) and then immediately played 'Jean Pierre' and realised that those two albums are connected in a straight line. Love it."
3,Good series but incomplete,"The series were good but without being able to get the rest it remains incomplete.Have a slight problem concerning the colour, as it keeps going black and white, have no idea what is causing it?"
4,About bloody time!,I LOVED this show when it was on the air for the first two seasons (with Matthew Porretta) as Robin Hood. Of course I was in my teens then and had yet to inundate myself with all things production-wise. Watching it now that I'm older... apart from some dialogue and design things most likely due to the budget they had... I STILL LOVE IT!! I love the fantasy elements and some of the cheesiness. The show never promised anything more than roughly 45 minutes entertainment (rest of time for commercials) and family fun when it was on. It is like 'Hercules: The Legendary Journeys' in that respect. And watching both shows now with the education I've had... I still love them for what they are. I just hope the decision is made to release the second season! There was--what I recall to be--an awesome episode with Montel Williams as a guest star!
4,Fan of Robin Hood?,"If you like stories and movies of this sort, you'll probably enjoy this dvd set.I'm now waiting for season 2 of this.It showed on local TV here in the early to mid 90s, I believe.It stars Matthew Porretta, who was in Robin Hood Men in Tights, a hilarious movie... he was Will Scarlett O'hara... from Georgia. [that edited line makes sense if you've seen the movie.]Enjoy!"
2,Misled & Mad,"Because I pre-ordered this item, I was under the assumption that it was the 2 disc TV version. As I gave this as a gift, I can't hardly send it back, but am frustrated by the lack of information provided."
2,worship jamz,great music for my 8 yr.old to listen to when wanting to switch from the ordinary music on the radio. Excellent tunes to dance as well.
1,WHY!,I have a deep hatred of this CD! My grandparents bought this for me for Christmas and I was throughly dissapointed.One being: I'm an Atheist.Two being: I think Christainity is screwy.Three being: These children cannot sing.Four being: It's sad people have to make CD's like this.Five being: The music is all very annoying!Six being: It just sucks as a CD and should not be bought!Save yourself 30 bucks and go buy something worth your money!
1,False Advertisement,"Be advised! This CD only comes with 1 CD. Don't be fooled when you read the Jewels case ""As Seen On TV"". It's not. The one on TV comes with 2 CD."
2,What a scam!,"Just as the other people expressed, I'm very disappointed with getting one disc instead of two. This is ridiculous that it's not marked on the cd. I also have to pay the shipping now to send it back. This is a christian cd and now I feel like they are running a scam."
1,Disappointed,After my daughter excitely waited for this to arrive. I was greatly disappointed to find this only had one cd instead of two. I feel we were mislead. I am returning this item.
2,"Great music for kids, poor quality recording","I have no problem with the music in this collection itself. The style is great for kids, and the message is what is important. As far as that goes, I'd give it five stars. The problem I have with this product is the quality of the recording. All the bass is distorted for every song. Don't know if that was intentional or not. I'm a musician, so maybe I pay more attention to that sort of thing than most people, but personally, I think it sounds terrible."
5,IMPORTANT NOTE REGARDING WORSHIP JAMZ,"This version is NOT the same version that is on TV. This is an 18 song version that you can find in retail stores. The 30 song version is availalbe on TV or Amazon for $22.99. Please don't confuse these 2 items. Amazon is selling this retail only version for $13.99 which is a excellent value for an 18 song disc.Thank you for your understanding,Fuseic Music - Producer of Worship Jamz"
1,"Worship Jamz - ""Not As Seen On TV!""","My daughter pointed out her favorite songs are not on this CD. I purchased two ""Worship Jams"" paying the 13.99. I purchased these thinking they would be the original 2 CD set. Is this an illegal product? Why was it not stated that it was only a portion of the songs. I purchased this with a pre-release thinking it would be the same as seen on T.V. Customer feedback was not available at that time as the CD was a pre-sale of a music to be released. I will be returning the unopened gift CD I purchased. I will also be very hesitant to order again.L. Crull"
5,Master swimmer,Good fit. Substantial fabric. Great price. The test is in their durability and resistance to chlorine.
5,Perfect,great for tech math or financial math small face plate protected when not in use large digital read out great litlle calc
5,Canon Calculator is perfect.,"This Canon Calculator is excellent! I bought two, one for my wife and one for myself. They are perfect since they run off of battery and solar. We both really love this calculator."
3,Too big for cell phones,"I ordered this for my large Motorola flip phone. Once inside the pouch, I could barely reach the phone at the bottom of the pouch. I call this a pouch because it doesn't fit snugly around the phone, but has ample room for other items such as a charger, extra battery pack, or small gasoline powered electric generator. This holster would fit a cordless phone, but I don't know of any cell phones large enough to fit in this satchel."
4,Bucket Boss holster,"The product arrived on time and in perfect shape. First thing I noticed was that it was larger than I anticipated. However this is not necessarily a bad thing, as I can carry a pen and small swiss army knife. I like the fact that it doesn't have a swivel clip, which always drove me nuts, let alone dropping the phone all the time. Only time will tell how well it holds up. If the company would make a smaller version it would have been ideal!"
4,Changing it from belt clip to belt loop style,"Received it within two days, the phone fit nicely with the antenna to one side.However the thing popped off my web style belt too easily. Later, missing it I located it in the car where again, the holder had come off my belt.I used a cable tie (nylon wire tie) to fasten the open end of the belt clip closed. Now the device absolutely won't come off my belt.All's well now."
4,Bucket Boss,Delivered as promised and of the quality described. Larger than I thought it would be my cell phone was very loose in it. Not a good phone case but will work well for other items of the proper size.
5,great for portable home/office phone. Not cell.,"Very happy. W. product. Bought it for use at work where I needed a portable traditional phone (NOT cell), to be on me at all times as I moved about the company for the never ending phone calls. Sturdy clip, didn't try to pop phone out when I needed to grab the phone quick. If u use it like I do, you will want to cut off the cover so the flap doesn't obscure the pocket for faster answering. Otherwise, clip onto pocket of jeans in stead of waist band, and curl flap backwards into pocket. Worked for me. Would buy again. Great durable stitching. :)PS U can ue this if u have a thick durable construction worker type of cell phone too. Beware of height of holster vs. ur phone. It covered 1/2-3/4 or office portable phone. 3/4 if memory serves me correctly."
4,"Great book, but there are no penguins in the Arctic region..",I think this is an absolutely wonderful book. The illustations are fantastic and I highly recommend any books by Harry Horse (little lost rabbit for example). The only reason why I have given this book 4 instead of 5 stars is that the explorers bump into penguins in their quest to find polar bears.... There are no penguins in the Arctic region and I do want my children to know that.
2,There aren't any penguins in the North Pole,"The book has a lot of potential, but the fact that the author places penguins in the North Pole simply ruins it. Did he really not know?? While the book is charmingly illustrated, and the text has a nice touch of whimsy, the glaring placement of penguins where there are none makes me think the author is either utterly careless or simply doesn't care."
1,Tries to be whimsical but just silly,"This story is about the voyage of the narrator and his dog Roo to the Arctic to track down the 'the last polar bears'. While the illustrations do have some charm, they are outweighed by irritations such as the presence of penguins en route to the North Pole (coyly but unsatisfactorily justified in an author's note at the start of the book). There can be a fine line between whimsical and silly, and this story is often pointlessly silly. The ship's captain gives Roo a tin of macaroni cheese. Later on, the explorers are caught in a blizzard and all their equipment is blown away; Roo then 'brought out the tin of macaroni' (from where?) which they then manage to open, heat up and eat (with what?). The subplot about the last of the world's ice cream is equally silly and pointless, as is the author's anthropomorphising of Roo (""I wish she wouldn't waste her money"").However, I will have to admit that my five-year old likes the story! There's no accounting for taste."
3,PASHA DE CARTIER BY CARTIER FOR MEN,Good aroma. I just tested it. The spray does not provide a good mist; it's more than a squirt. The aroma seems real. That is my only remark.
2,Black marks all over faucet,"Currently, we're remodeling our bathroom and my uncle recommended this brand. When I first received this faucet, there were black marks all over the base. I requested a replacement and the second one had even more black marks. These marks can not be removed because they seem to be part of the finish. The faucet seems sturdy enough and would look fine if it wasn't for the marks. I am very disappointed with this purchase."
5,Good product,"In 30 years of remodeling, I have never had a problem with any Kohler product. Their faucets are solid, well built and operate very smoothly. I have also used Delta, Moen, Price Pfister, American Standard and cheaper faucets when the home owners budget required it. Kohler is hands down the best product, using heavy brass castings and far fewer plastic parts. I have a lot of customers I have served for almost 30 years and I have never had a call-back for any Kohler product. Delta offers free, no questions asked replacement parts for life, but I have never had a need to replace any parts with the Kohler product line."
5,Kohler faucet,"We had Kohler faucets in our new house and one delta. After a couple of months the delta faucet started dripping so we got on Amazon.com and found the kohler faucet to match the other bathrooms. It was a Kohler K-12182-cp Fairfax. When we got it I found out that I needed a multi hole faucet so I sent this one back, no questions asked and they sent me the one I needed."
5,Love it!,"Since I didn't know much about replacing my bathroom faucet, I wrongly ordered a single hole instead of a three hole.I ordered the new one and sent back the wrong one and the second one was in place within the week. I love the faucet, and working with Amazon. I actually designed my bathroom around the faucet because I love the style of it. I've had it around 2 weeks and haven't had any problems except it drains pretty slowly so I unscrew the stopper until the water goes down the drain faster. Easy to shine up!"
1,Ehhh,"Out of the 25 protective cases.4 were ripped off meaning the side were ripped off.Very disappointing. Normally i buy protective cases from the store, I tried amazon because they were cheaper.This is what i get for cheap stuff like this!"
3,Not what I expected,"When I put this video in, I was expecting to see 100 bone crushing hits, but I was disappointed. Don't get me wrong, there were some bone crushing hits, but alot of the tackles were on the list do to their importance on the game or the player who made the tackle. It was was still pretty good."
1,Bad,"This is the worst DVD I have ever purchased. Bad stories, bad editing, bad reporting, bad effects.Generally, it's bad."
4,dance 'til you drop,"just when you thought you couldn't possibly shake your groove thang any more, along comes ""I See You Baby"" and the dance floor beckons once again. a worthy successor to Fatboy Slim's ""The Rockafeller Skank"" and Apollo 440's ""Stop The Rock,"" Groove Armada's irresistible tune (made even more delectable by Fatboy Slim himself) gets your body moving in all the best ways and will likely be included on a gazillion compilations at the year's end. pop it in the stereo, crank it up, and git down. your booty will thank you later."
3,Got the job done but it broke!,"So we have this for a few months now, it has worked during that time. I've used on carpet, tile and linoleum. Well, my husband was using just recently and the bottom came off. I realize this would eventually happen but not so soon. I will try something different next time."
3,OK for the money,"Probably better for older children who like quiz games and want to memorize a few facts, this desktop mobile doesn't allow for flexible play for younger children. It only runs in quiz mode, which means if you aren't ""playing"" the quiz game, the sun won't stay lit longer than a few minutes. A little disappointing for a little kid who just wants to fly his ship around the planets for adventure. Also, the planets' colors are mostly inaccurate, and big features (like Jupiter's red spot) aren't included. Uh, Uranus is not blue and white, Discovery Planet Challenge guys..."
5,Evenhanded Intellectual History,"A wonderful introduction to and overview of the works of one of the only coherent intellectual ""schools"" of the 20th century. Jay describes the penetrating insights (and weaknesses) of the thought of Adorno, Horkheimer, Marcuse et al., with mercifully little of the psychologizing that one often finds in intellectual history. Ideas and their relation to historical context are the focus, rather than personalities and psyches. The book is readable enough to be attractive for non-academics and academics alike. It would have been nice to have more on the post-1950 period, but the as the subtitle makes clear, this is beyond Jay's purview for this book."
5,Finally a usability book for programmers,"I finally finished reading this book, and I have to say, in time it will give the other usability books a run for their money. This book is written for programmers, and the goal of the book is to help us programmers step into the shoes of the users. The other reviewer couldn't relate to the stories, but I sure could. The author fills the book with funny stories about strange things he's encountered over the years that have frustrated him. These stories show what it's like to be a user. When you take this knowledge and apply it to programming, you start to understand how to build software for the user. Also, unlike other usability books, this one actually gets into some programming, with real-live code samples in C++! This guy really *is* a programmer. He even talks about design patterns, and methodologies like the Rational Unified Process. Get this book, read it, and start making great software."
5,"Hullabaloo, Vol. 5-8","It was fun to go back and see some of my musical favorites. I was reminded that I was lucky enough to grow up in the GREATEST music era of all time. If you love rock & roll, this is a must. I have all volumes. My 21 yr. old son absolutely loves it. Great Fun. Lane Mende, Texas"
4,It is what it is...,"First off, if you're going to buy any one of the three DVDs that are available in this set; this is the one to get. Song for song, and performance for performance, this compilation captures the ""Best Of..."" Hullabaloo. The Rolling Stones performance of ""Get Off My Cloud"", alone, makes this ""the one"" to have.But, recognize that most of these performances are ""canned"" and that that the presentation is nothing short of corny. Try to imagine the Lovin Spoolful singing ""May the Bird of Paradise Fly Up Your Nose"" surrounded by franticly gyrating dancers! But, it was the mid-sixties, after all; and the frug, jerk and pony were actually wild dances performed in go-go boots by hormonally-charged teenagers. Anyway, if you were born in the early 1950s, you know exactly what I mean.So, take it for what it is: a period piece that captures the essence of music in the transitional mid-sixties...when you could let your hair down even if it was just barely over your ears."
2,Good shows - bad manufacturing,"It won't play in my laptop - and the manufacturer (MPI Video) says ""..I've been told by our sales department that most of them do notplay well on Computer DVD's and some do not play at all on them.""Okay I guess, if you never want to play it on a computer system."
4,As good as they say,"Was surprised how much fur came out of my Sheltie. She's already well groomed but has excess fur on what we call her ""pants"" around the back side and tail. The tool really worked through this difficult area and pulled tons of fur out. That being said, she didn't like it and think it wasn't comfortable for her even while trying to be gentle. We took breaks and did a little at a time. Pulling fur out is still ripping fur out so you need to be careful. Not using the jaws of death either- the regular tool was extreme enough and didn't want to torture her."
3,Worked Perfectly Until it Broke.,"This rake worked perfectly for de-matting our Goldendoodle until it cracked, rendering it nearly useless. Serious mattes deserve serious tools, I guess. We got what we paid for, which in this case was only about three months of use."
5,BEST GROOMING TOOL!,"I have two dogs, a Siberian Husky and a Border Collie mix. Every brush that I bought before this one couldn't keep the mats out of the border collie's fur! We were constantly having to hack away at her coat! But since I got this tool, her fur is cleaner (whcih means she smells better) and few mats! As far as the husky goes, well it takes no time at all to brush through her thick coat as well. Huskies shed heavily in the spring and fall, which used to mean I would have to brush her and pull large tufts of fur out for weeks! But since I got this tool, all it takes is a few swipes of the rake and her coat looks smooth and tuft free! There's less fur all over the floor, which means less vacumming, and both dogs are scratching less since they have less extra fur, not to mention, the fact that they are cleaner all around."
5,works better then i expected,this grooming tool is awesome. i bought it out when i was getting my pomeranian i tested it out on my cat. it worked great by the time i was done i had a clone on the floor. my pittbull loves the way it feels he almost falls down to the floor out of relaxation. its funny. i would recommend this product for any type of pet with or without shedding problems. great product im gonna by one for my mom.
2,de-matting blades way too dull to be effective,"The de-matting blades are very dull; I want a comb where the blades have rounded tips but a blade surface that will slice through the matt like butter--these blades require you to hack and saw and pull, and even then it ends up just pulling the hairs (of my shrieking, writhing dog) out by the root, rather than slicing through the matt and leaving the hairs still attached to my dog. If I wanted to just grab the matt and rip it out by the roots, I could use a comb for that purpose. This tool is essentially useless on my Havanese dog's coat."
1,"Terroble for undercoat, not effective at all","I bought this a long time ago after reading rave reviews. I dont have a dog with long hair but one with an undercoat and shedding is a huge issue everytime seasons change. I bought this expensive thing in the hope that if it works then money is not that much.But it doesnt do much to clear the undercoat. I go on it maybe 10 times on my dog and only get a very very small amount of undercoat. MY HANDS DO A BETTER JOB THAN THIS! No kidding...I am thinking of getting the FURminator at this point since this is just money down the drain, for my purpose atleast..."
4,# 3 a charm .,Third brush purchased for golden retriever (adopted).Furminator was good . This is much betterHas two sets of combs attached to handle ; 1 for undercoat other for dematting. Just flip the one you want in place and get ready.I don't normally rate items but this comb rated one . Better instructions would be 5 star.D.J.Fortes
3,Works ok,Not super happy with it as my dog is a chow and thought this is what I needed but dont work to well I dont think
5,"Doesn't look much, worked like a charm and then some","This brush may not look much at first, but the effectiveness cannot be overstated. I have a long hair husky that we brushed regularly and didn't think much of it until I got this brush. Even without the knot cutter (the long bladed edge), the rake itself is so functional that the first day we removed another bucket hair that we didn't even know was there. I am an online shopaholic, and she said this is the best $10 I spent!"
1,"DANGEROUS, now I'm afraid to use it on my poor dog","The rake type design is great, but the ends of these blades are EXTREMELY sharp. I was brushing the front coat of my Sheltie and the brush came out and hit my arm and put several deep holes in my arm. It didn't even hit my arm that hard. Now I scared to think of how it must feel on the poor dog if it reaches the skin and I scrap it along, and I'm using the short end of this flipping blade (you push one side of the blade down and the other side pops up. One side is short and one side much longer). If you buy this tool, you must be very careful how you use it. The smallest mistake could cause very bad cutting to the animal and you."
3,Good tool for the price- light use.,"Good punch set, but this is one of those, ""you get what you pay for tools"". For light uses, this performs great. But if you need it for heavy duty jobs, move to another more expensive one. The only thing that isn't good about this is the small ""screwdriver"" tool that comes with the punch. It is thin metal and bends almost instantly under minimal pressure. I would recommend it if you are on a budget without hesitation."
3,good metal punch,comes with full die set. dies have a tendency to dull and stick. Half the price of witney. Depth guide is cheap in construction and will bend easily in pouches. Dies are quick and easy to change
4,Nice for a hobbiest,"It's a nice tool the main part of the tool is ridged. It will punch holes with little effort. The postitive stop is kind of cheesey not really sure why it has a scale on it but hey it looks offical. The tool comes with it that is used to remove the bottom poriton of the punch bent the first time I used it, no biggie you can remove these by hand. Overall I would buy it again for the price."
4,works well,Works well but one set of Die Sets are no good and do not work at all. I would like to get them replaced.
5,Great deal,I got the item very fast and it looks just like the one I thought I had lost which I paid a lot more for. Very happy with this deal. A+++
5,hand punch quicker and cleaner than a drill,"This is the ideal solution for sheet metal as it will punch a quicker and cleaner hole than a drill. It leave a perfect hole which is virtually burr free. Why didnt I get one sooner? Didnt get around to it. Eh, I'll just drill a hole. Now that it is available it gets used all the time.Of course it cannot punch more than 2 "" past the edge, actually its just under in real life. And 16 gauge is its safe limit, but is an upper limit."
4,Works well,Does the job. Wish it was a tad cheaper like Harbor Freight jobbie or something... Using for sheet holes for rivets. Cuts through like butter. Even cuts through aluminum barstock.
5,A great gadget,"This article works very well for what I needed it for. It is able to assist me in placing holes in flat metal pieces. I have never changed the hole size because, the original hole size has been great. The ease at which this product works is dependent on the thickness of the metal. The only drawback I have found is that the mouth of the tool is occasional smaller than I would like. There are times I would like to put holes in pieces that are flat in the center but, are domed or have some angles. Otherwise, this product is great. Lastly, the shipping was extremely fast. I had almost opted to pay for express delivery and there was no need."
4,Nice Tool,Tool does what it is described for a reasonable price. Only request would be to have a better depth gauge and screwdriver.
3,"heavy, wish it made a couple more smaller holes","i haven't had this for long but i was able to punch through a 22-gauge copper sheet without a problem. it's sort of hard to see exactly where you're about to punch through, and i wish it made a couple more smaller holes, just to bring through a 24-gauge wire through (for jewelry). it does it what it needs to do, but is a bit heavy for my kid-sized hands."
4,Definitely heavy duty,"I got this for working with leather and multiple layers of heavy duty cloth. While I haven't put it to the full test yet, I'm sure it will fit the bill. My only issue with it, is that the handles open wider than my grip! I can't use it with only one hand, so I'll be struggling a bit for accuracy trying to use two hands to position my leather/fabric and operate the punch. But, a tool that will punch through these materials easily is half the battle."
3,Good product/ false advertising,"i love this product, goes through abs plastic with ease. however advertising says it can punch through 16 guage steel. tried it out and did not punch through anything over 20 guage."
3,hand punch,"it look cheap coming out of the box,should of went the 100.00 more to find quality product,I would not buy from this product online again, picture is deceiving............."
5,Punches holes with ease,"I noticed there were quite a few of these on Amazon, this one was prime and had a lot of good reviews so I got it. I build robots with 1/16th aluminum or steel sheets and this is able to punch large holes fast and easy. It beats drilling the metal for sure. I highly recommend this if you are doing any project that requires more than a few holes in sheet metal. The only slight problem is that the spacer between the handles is smaller than my fingers. So if I put a lot of pressure on the top handle, when the punch goes through my fingers will hit the bottom handle."
3,Interesting Overview of a Classic Series,Muir does a comprehansive episode by episode review of the 2 seasons of the show. I very much enjoyed his analyses of each episode though I found the comparisons with shows such as STAR TREK a little distracting. There were also errors of fact carried over from the original hardback version of this book; I would like to have seen the publishers give Muir the opportunity to revise the text before publishing this paperback version.I don't agree with all of Muir's comments by any means and I also think he short-changed Year 2. Granted in many ways it did not match the first season but it had a look and feel all of its own and I think Muir did not emphasise this enough.Overall a good read. Perhaps not the definitive analysis of Space 1999 but a good attempt. But be prepared to disagree with the author on some of his opinions!
4,The title fits,"I must say that the title was well suited for this book. When Zach receives divorce papers he is not believing it and is willing to try to make his marriage work although it has only been a year. Don't get me wrong, there are some marriages worth fighting for success while there are some that just aren't meant to be. The title tells you how much this man loved his woman and is determined to keep her in his life."
5,A Great Read,"I really enjoyed this novel, although I had a little trouble with his pushy ways. Any women in her right mind knows for a fact that him being so bossy and pushy would get on their last nerve. I finally got over that feeling once I continued to read the story. He loved Amanda alot and I guess for her to see it he had to push himself back into her life for her to see it. Once again great read I can't wait for a new novel to be published."
4,Good Read,I am a fan of Bette Ford and this book let me know that once again she is an excellent author. Zach has chosen to pledge his love to one woman and one woman only and he sets out to prove it. Amanda on the other hand has no problem doubting his true love and affection for her and sets out to prove him wrong. The chemistry between the two is amazing. The plot twists are not to wild but interesting none the less. An enjoyable read.
3,Okay Read,"I was dissapointed in this book. I thought it was dragged out and I was ready for it to be over with. I could have choked Amanda, I mean Zach didn't deserve that kind of treatment. It's like she forgot he also lost a child as well. I don't recomment this book but I will continue to read Mrs.ford books."
4,Truly helped me discover and avoid my allergies,"Offers a step-by-step plan to determine personal allergies and, by avoiding them, gain better health and avoid backaches, headaches, tiredness."
4,Bringing it all back,"Wow. I looked at the track listing, and thoughtI maybe recognised four or five of the songs.Putting the CD on, I found I knew maybe four orfive by heart, knew the first verse of four others,and liked the rest.My favourite has to be ""The Blood that Moves theBody"" -- is there another song about the Japanesetradition of seppuku? All these songs bring backmemories, especially ""Stay on these Roads"" whichcame out around the time my family emigratedfrom Ireland. A-ha did very well in Ireland, andI seem to recall several #1s. Even now the songsstand up to comparison with modern song writing,lyrically and melodically. ""The Living Daylights""is the only rival to Goldfinger for best Bondtheme, and ""Hunting High and Low"" has the creepysubtext of the best ballads (think ""Every BreathYou Take"").A concentrated hit of 80's nostalgia that won't betaken out of my CD player for a while."
4,"The best A-Ha CD in existence, great 80s compilation","Although of course best known for the ubiquitous synthdance confection, Take On Me, there's actually quite a lot to recommend here. All 16 tracks are excellent representations of the 80s New Wave movement; fans of Erasure, Depeche Mode, New Order, Pet Shop Boys, etc. will be quite pleased. Besides you-know-what, there's also Cry Wolf, a great dance song that saw little US airplay; a gorgeous remix of their finest ballad, Hunting High And Low; and, IMHO, their very finest dance track, The Sun Always Shines On TV. Everything else has minor flaws, but is still very enjoyable. If you want to remember the glittery 80s in all their hairsprayed MTV glory, get this CD!"
4,Almost as good as The Warrants...,"This album lived up to the expectations which were first created in 1985 with the release of the hit single (with the equally successful video clip) Take on me. But, it wasn't as good, or as fulfilling as John Doe and The Warrants: The Hits 1984 - 1990. My recomendation to any A-Ha, or Duran Duran fan is get yourself a copy of this, or any of their other hit albums (Sleep On Monday, Her Name was Lena)as you definitely won't be dissappointed.A top album - John Doe and The Warrants."
3,Brings you in the mood. The mood of the 80's. So sad. So 80,"Manhattan Skylines and The Sun Always Shines on Tv are the greastest song on this album. A mix of Scandinavian Pop and European syntheizer music. Some poor songs included. But, all in all an album, that brings me in a speciel mood. A mood of happy sadness (?) and going 15 years back in time. Love and unhapiness in a cold decade."
4,Headlines and Deadlines - The Hits of A-HA,"Headlines and Deadlines - The Hits of A-HA being a compilation album by the Norweigan band A-HA and was released 1991. A-HA's music is mix of synth pop, new wave and pop rock. My favorite tracks are ""I've been losing you"", ""Crying in the rain"" and ""The sun always shines on tv"". The booklet has no lyrics which is quite usual for a compilation. For each track we get a date of release but not a list of whom plays what. 4/5."
5,Max's 2nd Best,"I sat down and read this book completely through. Very well done. I see this as one of the best Christian books I have read. This is Max Lucado's second best. His absolute best is ""No Wonder They Call Him the Savior."""
5,An uplifting book that inspires and motivates the reader.,"I first read ""He Still Moves Stones"" several years ago when a friend loaned it to me. I've purchased several copies since. Max Lucado captures the wonder of God's grace. I read it again a month ago and cried again during the same passages. The book is layed out in a series of vignettes with common theme. I just gave a copy to a couple who are going through a tough time with a teenage child. He hasn't had a chance to read it, yet, but his wife is reading it. She told him today that she likes it very much and finds it motivational and uplifting."
4,The hardships of the people in the bible,"Although, I wish the audio version of this book could have been longer. But I think for once I actual got the story of Job. Also within the story he defines the role of the devil in the book. That despite the devil was banished from heaven he is still the servant of God whether he wants to be not. Many figures of the bible are represented from the bible are represented here and explains throught the majesty of God how he can still move stones."
4,He Still Moves Stones,"The book was very good, as all of Max Lucado's books. But, just as a heads up - the size of the print and the size of the book (dimensions of the pages) are very small. I would not have purchased it if I had been able to see it in person."
1,disappointing read.....,i was so excited to read this book as i adore the gorgeous syd.but this book was a big disappointment.
5,yahh,"worth the read, especially if you're a pink floyd/ Syd Barrett fan and you want to know the truth instead of w/e crap is spread around online"
4,NO ASSEMBLY REQUIRED!,I'm not exactly sure what everyone is complaining about when they speak of no instructions ... my lights came fully assembled. Well the stands did ... all you need to do is connect the clamps (which was pretty easily done by looking at the pictures on the box).I haven't tried the lights yet but just wanted to let everyone know that now they come nearly fully assembled.Also there was no mention of the actual bulbs being included (so I was concerned) but they did indeed come with light bulbs FTW!!
3,Need to know how to put it together?,Ok after it took me about an hour to figure out how to put this damn lights up. they worked fine. i have no problem with the lights them selve or the stands. they are all good and sturdy products. But what pisses me off is that it doesnt come with instructions on how to put it all together. I have to look at the picture on the box to see if what i did looked anything like what was on the box. I guess because it says quick and easy on the box they just assumed people would not how to assemble it. if it came with instructions i would recommend it. Cheap and good product. I guess when you pay more your paying for the instructions.
4,Okay calculator,Calculator is smaller than I expected (but may be fault of mine more than anything else). Calculator is 10x8 cm and the numbers are 2 cm tall. Numbers are easy to read even in dim light; is solar-powered as well so turns on immediately after opening. Buttons are pretty cheaply made (kind of jiggle in their spots) but I don't think it will be an issue really. Okay product for price (just wish I hadn't paid shipping on it).
1,calculator,calculator was a lot smaller than what you had advertised.i am really disatisfied with this item.i do not know if i will purshase any thing else from amazon/
5,Canon LS-82Z Calculator,"Just got this little calculator and love it. It is dual powered (solar & battery), has a small footprint (3.25"" x 4.25""), big 8 digit display, easy to use keys, and a tilt top. I recommend this product and may buy another one."
2,Disappointed in actual size,"I bought 3 of these thinking that the size would be adequate for a desk. It isn't. Though it works well, the size of the calculator is much smaller than what is alluded in the Amazon website. Yes, the dimensions were stated. But most calculators are larger...not humongous, just larger. Would not recommend to a friend."
3,Hmm...,"Works fine, great price, but too small. You don't realize a small calculator is annoying until you have one."
3,"Great calculator, but.....","I really like it, but I really notice how much I miss haveing a ""change sign"" button (the +/- that changes a positive number to a negative and vice versa). I'd give this calculator a 4.5 star if it had that."
2,So so,"Although the numbers display is ""large"" (relative to the size of the calculator, I did a ""large number calculator"" search on Google), the body of the calculator is dissappointingly small. Easy to hit more than one key at a time. I suppose the dimensions were posted in the ad for the product, but I didn't see them. Otherwise, I probably would have moved on. Does do basic calculations, though. Semi-portable, can fit in a largish pocket."
2,Not what I was hoping for,"I searched for ""Large Button Calculator"" and this was the first hit. It was inexpensive so I didn't think too much about it and ordered it. I should've checked the size first! It is only about 4-5 inches wide/tall and the buttons are very small. If you need a larger calculator for vision or just because you like a larger desk calculator, there is nothing large about this thing! It's downright petite! It's fine if you wanted a tiny compact purse calculator or something, but it's crummy for what I need it for, I'll have to buy something else. I gave it two stars because the display is nice and clear, and the solar/battery backup is good and quick... it's just not what I thought I was getting, which is why I rated it lower."
1,Picture is deceiving in size of calculator.,If a known blown up picture was supplied i would not of purschased this item. Picture of item is larger then the real item received.. but stuck with it now.
3,Smallish,"Definitely works, but is considerably smaller than your average desktop calculator. Also due to this I think, some of the buttons, notably the CE and ON buttons, are on the side of the number pad, not above it, as I am used to. Altho this would seem minor it makes for some fumbling around with the keys every time.If small is good for you think about this calkeylator, otherwise go for a regular one."
5,good little calc,"This thing is tiny, not like the one I had growing up. It's definitely pocket size and will work well for me taking it to the store as planned, works fine, love the solar or battery option. Batteries will cost you about three bucks to replace for this unit so beware that, it does not take double or triple a batteries, takes button cell, though with the solar, I'm guessing about once a year having to replace the internal battery. Good deal overall, I love the little thing. I have small hands this might be a problem for really big hands."
1,Much smaller than description says,I purchased this for my elderly Mother who has failing eyesight. I searched Amazon for large calculators and this looked good as description said 8.5 x 5 inches. The Calculator arrived and is actually about 3.5x 4.5 which is too small for my intended purpose.
5,One of Disney's Best,"I have a 16 year old son, and I have watched this movie at least 25 times with him since it came out. It is the moving epoch of a man whose only aim in life is to make his son happy, but he does it without regard to what his son sees as happiness. Goofy cannot see the opposition that his son gives to his plans for them, but what else would you expect from a man whose name is Goofy? In a world that treats fatherhood as an afterthought, this is a refreshing look at a man's unyielding love for his son. It ranks as one of the best all-time father-son movies."
3,"Great movie, but not-so-great DVD","Since this is one of my favorite Disney movies, I decided to get the DVD and see if it was worth the money, but unfortunatley it wasn't. One of the biggest problems with the DVD is that the film is not presented in its original aspect ratio. Another problem is the special features included. Out of all the stuff included, I was expecting a ""making of"" featurette, but Disney was too lazy to include it, not to mention one was already made back during the film's release and aired on the Disney Channel. Everything else seems ok, the VHS version of this movie is probably two times better. In other words, this is a great film, but the DVD is simlpy stupid."
3,Goofy,I thought movie was a cute and funny . However it's that the greatest kid movie ever. My son watched once but didn't want to again.
5,The best Disney movie ever made!,"Well, I don't like the original Disney movies because I outgrew them. I use to watch this movie a lot when I was in middle school and now I'm 23 and I still enjoy it. I think it's so funny. I enjoy some Disney movies like Aladdin, The Lion King, and Pinocchio but this one is far the best a lot better than the Goofy cartoons. I use to watch the Goof cartoons a lot everyday after school when I was very lil and when I heard that they made a movie out of it I was happy to hear that and it was the movie was awesome. I watched the sequel to A Goofy Movie and it was okay but the first one is really the best. You will enjoy it if your a Goofy fan."
5,I love this movie.,"I am in love with Goffy and I just am diggn' Max. If you haven't seen this movie go find it, or buy it here."
4,Wonderful movie with a lesson!,"A Goofy Movie is a wonderful children's movie that focuses on a father-son relationship that seems to get lost in the generation gap. It also sports a lesson to be learned in pretending to be what you are not as well as lessons on lying and on trust. Amidst these mainstreams, it is non-stop, fun filled, Goofy song and dance with just the right amount of humor. A great video in the Disney tradition for all ages!"
5,One of Disney's Best Unknown Movies,"The movie is about Max, Goofy's son, who has a crush on a girl and invites her to a party to watch a big radio star perform live. He's thrown for a loop though when his Dad announces they are going on a vacation for bonding. Max fibs to the crush, telling her he's going to be at the rock concert and that he'll join them onstage at the end. Then it's up to him to figure out how to get to CA instead of Lake Destiny for fishing.I have watched this movie with my nephew a hundred times and I still laugh at Big Foot dancing to the song Staying Alive. The songs are engaging and even as an adult I find myself enjoying them. The movie itself is witty, funny and teaches kids that honesty is the best policy and it's ok to love your weird family. It's easy to relate with Max, as a love struck teenager, and with Goofy, who just wants his son to be successful and law abiding.I cannot recommend this movie enough. It's not as popular as other Disney movies but it should be!"
3,Disney skimps,"There is no reason for this movie not to have been released as a widescreen edition. Except maybe Eisner was so greedy that he though by skimping on this he could boost his paycheck. Come on, Disney, do right by this movie and release the widescreen version to disk."
5,A definite classic,I used to watch the VHS copy of this with my son when he was very little. Now that he is 13 we still enjoy watching this movie. It has a great story and is very funny. A lot of parents could learn how to be a better parent by watching this movie.
5,Did not expect this!,"This movie kicked serious booty! It may not seem as good as it looks- but to me it was worth my while. Great character design, great animation, great storyline and very real in the way each generation is bizarrely different! I never liked goofy until i saw this movie. Max, Goofy's son, was clearly my favorite. Some of the road trip stops made me fall over laughing, and the climax/ outcomes of the movie were very unpredictable! I actually enjoyed the characters in the movie! Kids, teens and adults will like this movie. I liked it, and being a teenager myself, I don't feel embarrassed to comment the movie- I watched it when I was little, and now i watched it recently- honestly not expecting much- but i liked it! I enjoyed it so much I gave it 5 stars. The songs are slightly out of whack but I liked it all in all. Try it out!"
1,Should not be rated G -- viotent scenes.,"There is a scene when Goofy's son slaps a theme park character for no good reason. This scene was not funny and not necessary. I realize that they wanted to show his disappointment with the theme park, but Disney could have got the point across another way. There was another scene earlier in the movie when Goofy's son is on his way to school, and a girl punches his shoulder because he is acting not so cool. Also, the very beginning of the movie starts off with a nightmare, from which Goofy's son wakes up to punch the alarm clock. There is no need for any of this violence. I had to explain to my son too many times that this behavior is not acceptable in reality and this is only a cartoon. I wish Amazon would provide a refund. It is not what I expected from a movie that is rated G. It is definitely more like PG."
1,Day-Care Crud,"I'm suprised Disney would ever make a Day-Care video quality movie.But they did with A Goofy Movie.[The name suits it quite fine]A 1,at best."
4,Surprisingly Great Movie,"Amazon's in house reviewer above said ""strictly for young fans."" No, this is also for any adult who loves animation. I didn't like Goofy until i saw this movie. But I loved the way they wrapped a clever-thoughtful guy inside the awkward exterior. It gave me a new perspective.I'll admit a couple of the songs were a bit painful, but there are so many great gags and great sequences in this story I couldn't help but be impressed. This is way better than some of the high-budget princess movies Disney was grinding out at the same time. And this was done by Disney's second string animators... wow!It's a road movie, it's a buddy movie, it's a teen romance movie, it's a father-son movie, it's a whacky neighbor movie, it's a satire movie, it's a musical movie... all rolled into one."
5,It's the leaning tower of cheesa~~~,OH god this movie is great. I saw it for the first time when I was probably 8 or 9 and I used to hate Goofy. I saw the movie and I absolutely fell in love with it. I just bought the DVD a couple of days ago and still love it. It is definatly one of my favorite Disney movies--I can't go throught watching it once without cracking up hysterically every time. It's the movie I remember making me remember who Pauley Shore was and the first time I'd ever seen Bigfoot disco to the Bee Gees. It's definatly a classic.
4,Great!,"This movie is awesome, except for the fact that it endswith a kiss, ( which is kind of bad, with an exciting plot itjust ends with THAT.)"
3,"Not one of my favorites, but still nice for younger children","After first sitting through this movie with my elder sister, I wondered how she managed to rope me into it. I was tired, groaning inwardly, and vowing to avoid this movie at all costs. Why three stars then, if it was such a brain killer? Because, for children around 8-13, and the occasional person such as my dear sister, it was a smash hit that would be remembered for years, or at least for a week. The Goofy antics, and a star cameo by none other than Bigfoot, had her rolling in stiches of laughter even while I was just rolling my eyes. Goofy stays in clutzy form with the extra trouble of single dadhood, while Max is the stereotypical ""selfish only child"" for a good part of the movie. However, there are a few characters I have to sheepishly admit liking, no matter how... colorful they where. As a Father-Son bonding movie, with memorable characters, and crazy antics it's so-so for adults but great for children."
3,"Great movie, but why pan & scan?","A true family film, fun for all ages. Funny, well defined characters, and a good story. A Goofy Movie is likely one of the most over looked Disney films, it's also one of the best. I rate A Goofy movie right up there with Tarzan. So why did I only rate it a three? Pan and Scan. This Movie should be 1.66:1 not 1.33:1(full screen TV). They lopped a chunk of the picture off each side.Also check out ""An Extremely Goofy Movie"", it is just as much fun and the DVD version has not been hacked. The full original 1.66:1 picture is there."
3,Strong story ends with a weak ending,A Goofy Movie started out with a huge comical bang and strong storyline concerning father and son. The entire cast of toons and the music made it great fun. But just as Goofy snaps at his son on the edge of a road the writers feel the need to let Goofy's car roll off into the river. Thus killing the emotional compact that could have built up here. A Goofy movie fares as an average film due to this. And did we need to see Goofy and Max singing on top of a car floating in the river? This was the only lame musical number in the movie. A Goofy Movie had the potential to be a great film but sadly they tripped at the finish line.
3,"An entertaining movie for kids, but not a great story","This movie is not based on the original Goofy. The music and rhythm is certainly the 90s and the story takes place when Max was thirteen years old. This is definitely a movie for the youngsters and the recent teens, and is not aimed at the adults unless they are on a scientific trip."
4,a good movie,"the grandson laughed a lot at this movie, but at times would loose intrest due to slow or uninteresting parts."
5,Goofy Movie,My son is 2 1/2 and loves GOOFY! This is a big hit in our home! Very up to date and a loveable movie!
5,second greatest movie ever!,"I first decided to watch this movie because I heard that Jason Marsden (who is the cutest and most talented actor ever!) did the voice of Goofy's teenage son Max. But my best friend and I soon found ourselves watching it twice in a row and singing along with all of the catchy tunes (yes, I'm aware that sounds stupid) and reciting our favorite lines. I also saw the sequel (X-tremely Goofy Movie) and loved it as well. This movie was hilarious and is Disney's greatest accomplishment because it's a movie that both kids and parents can relate to. Next to one of Jason's other movies, ""White Squall"" (1996) this is the greatest movie I've ever seen. I'm going to buy the soundtrack and a copy of the movie itself. The cast did a brilliant job, the writers should be seriously congratulated, and the songs were terrific. This movie is outstanding and definitely deserves more than 5 stars."
5,Great for the Whole family!,"The very first time I saw this movie was while I was on a baby sitting job. The kids kept insisting we watch ""goofy movie! goofy movie!"" at first I was like ""Oh great, another little kids movie..."" but from the very beginning of the movie I was laughing. This is a great movie!Six years had past since then and I hadn't seen it in a while until it came on the Disney Channel. Upon seeing it again I knew I had to own the movie.The plot is sweet, and though Max shows obvious resentment towards his fathers ""goofy-ness"" and the obvious effect it has on him too, you get the sense that he really does love his father, he just forgot how to show it.I give the movie a 5, because I value family relationships over and above ANYthing else in a movie. Sure it was funny, but the family qualities in this movie are great."
4,Lucky Sevens,"I missed seeing Dave Carter for the first time by a week, at Falconridge Folk Festival, and having only recently discovered Drum, Hat, Buddha I was crushed to think there would be no more songs from this fantastic pair. Imagine my joy to learn this album had been released. I had some reservations, though, about an album released after Dave's death, thinking the songs would perhaps be poor quality demos or unfinished roughs. I need not have worried. This album, though not their best, doesn't fall short in any category, and in fact contains my new favorite song- Snake Handlin' Man. Thanks, Dave and Tracy."
4,"High as the Mountain, Deep as the Sea","Oh How I missed Dave Carter, and then this CD came out. We finally had more. And I was heartened by this cd. I really enjoyed it, especially the title song. Dave Carter is one of those musicians that you might not get at first, but if you tilt your head, or heart, and give him a few listens he will swoon right in. I, now, love his voice, and I think his songwriting is magnificent. I didn't like all of the songs on this album, but I like most of them and still enjoy it today. Thanks Dave, we miss ya."
3,A good DJ CD and a good buy (2 discs),"This album is not the greatest. There are some very melodic songs and some with pounding bass that dominates. 'Everybody's a Rockstar' is a pounding, standout track that everyone can get into. I personally like the track 'Be There' a lot as well. The remix's are excellent. Almost every one is really good. Some of the tracks can get too repetitive at times, but this is a minor problem. Overall this is a fairly good purchase if you enjoy house music. Most of my favorite DJ's are trance DJ's and this CD disappointed me somewhat. I do recommend artists such as Sasha and BT over Tall Paul. I think his style is not as interesting in some ways as other DJs."
1,Save your Money!,"I apologize for being so honest, however, this c.d. isn't worth much. Even at .75 cents, you'd be waisting your money. Unless, that is, you don't have some of the tracks on this disc. This is an old c.d., so the tracks are older. Some of the tracks are o.k., if you don't own them already.The second c.d. has the same tracks that are on the first c.d. but they're remixed by Paul. Some of these mixes are good, however, I still wouldn't waist your money. Buy one of his other c.d.s instead. Paul actually is an outstanding d.j.. I've seen him in Los Angeles several times. However, this c.d. is a waist of time listening and money on shipping. Considering that I paid .01 cent on Amazon for these c.d.s, I still paid too much. Sorry Paul, it's o.k. though, this is an old c.d. and one of his first c.d.s made. Thanks for reading! See my other reviews for great c.d.s."
1,hated this,Stupid movie with very bad acting. Didn't even watch it all the way through. Don't waste your time - it's bad!
5,What An Incredible book!!!!!!,I believe this book was terrific and helped me a lot in baseball. I feel all coaches and parents of baseball childeren should read this book. This book gives all pointers in how to field and bat using all kinds of techniques. I give this book a thumbs up and disagree to the people who think this book was dissapointing. I hope many people get to learn from this review and recommendation. Choose to read this book and you'll thank me.
5,On Point! If I could give her more stars I would...,I only heard this song once and I know I have to get the whole lp. The girl is on point and she aint showing off too much like most sistahs these days. She seems pretty real and I know a lot of people will feel the same.
4,"I haven't even BOUGHT this single, and I'm sold.","I saw the video a couple of days ago, and I just have to get it, and the LP when it comes out. ""Get Up"" is a great single with a nice groove and brisk lyrics, and Amel's voice brings it all together. She is another talented sister who is going for hers. I hope her new joint does well."
4,A Bright Future,"This girl has a bright future ahead of her. If you enjoy the works of other artists such as Erykah Badu or Sade, Amel Larrieux is definitely someone you should keep an eye out for. This is urban contemporary music at it's finest. The only thing that prevented me from giving this cd 5 stars is its inclusion of only 2 tracks. Perhaps Epic will eventually release a maxi-single with a few remixes or a non-album track. At this time however, there are no other options. Anyhow, be sure to check-out her debut solo album coming out in January 2000. I just hope that she gets the recognition and praise she deserves."
5,Excellent and challening book,Very challenging to read the true stories from around the world. Makes Jesus' words on suffering come true today.Very well written. Easy to read. Great devotional book. Excellent illustrations. Would recommend reading. Opens your eyes to the life of Christian around the world. We need to see God in action. Like the set up of the book. Every Christian pastor needs to read this.
2,Jesus Freaks repackaged?,"I was a bit disappointed with this book since a majority of the stories that I have read so far appear in the Jesus Freak books. Also, condensing the full stories of these amazing heroes of faith into little bite size devotional nuggets seems to lose some of the impact. That being said, Voice of The Martyrs is a great organization to support anyways, so go ahead and buy it."
5,a life changer,I highly recommend this book to every Christian out there. It is a serious book with heavy substance but worth every word. What makes it even more powerful is that these are real stories and real words coming from people like me and you who took a stand for the one who gave his life for us. This is not a book to be passed up!
3,Use Caution,"Our family has been reading this book after dinner. The narrative about the faith of the persecuted church and those who bore the Cross of Christ truly is a testimony we all should hear. This book would be better if it left it to the narrative without the editorializing. Some of the comments made by the editors are biblical; however some are just ""positive thinking"" and psychobabble. This is a travesty to the memory and testimony of these martyrs of the faith."
3,"Very strange, but satisfying.","I watched this on video rental, so you can imagine my concern when the screen went blank. Then I found out that a blank screen is part of the movie...and happens OFTEN. The director is also fond of giving us a picture of a place. Nothing happens, and then the character comes on screen and walks past the place. The camera then stays on the empty place. Unfortunately, the places were not that interesting.I think the whole idea of the movie is to give snapshots into a teen's life. I didn't read the part that tells what the movie is about...so at first, the boy's solemnity meant nothing to me. It just felt weird.In the end, there are some interesting characters, some precious moments. I was glad I watched it, but probably wouldn't want to see it again."
1,Not what you think.,"As a high school Model U.N. instructor I thought this would be a great way to introduce MUN to new students. In fact, the product description says the same thing. And I quote: ""An excellent way to introduce your students to the exuberance and value of Model U.N. participation."" So I bought the DVD and watched it first (luckily). The language is terrible. It's a reality show for MUN partipants. Not entirely a bad thing but when they started using the occasional expletive I began to be worried. THEN the insructor starts using the f-word! (multiple times) Very tacky and not a good reflection on the MUN program. Save your money."
3,Good..but get to the point already!!,"In the end, after all is said and done, I'll admit the characters were lively, and the plot very good. But I was exhausted by the time I finished reading this book! It took forEVER to get to the point of things, and there was a lot of repeated dialogue. Imagine pulling on a string, hoping to get to the end, and you find yourself tugging, and tugging, and tugging in frustration, but to no avail. That's how I felt when reading this novel."
5,This Book Caused Me to Become A Cookson Fan!,"While browsing through the shelves at my local library, the title of this book - A House Divided - caught my attention. I think it brought to mind some passage in the Bible referring to the fact that a house divided cannot stand. At any rate, reading this book caused me to become a Catherine Cookson fan. Even though it isn't now my favorite book of her works, it must have been pretty great to cause me to go back over and over again in search of her stories. When I had read every book that both the local library and a library in a nearby town had to offer, I began ordering the ones I had not read through Amazon. I have now read over 80 of her more than a hundred novels and I am still searching. Great author!"
2,"Good movie, Lousy DVD","They botched this DVD release something fierce, it's a 4:3 Pan & Scan copy with Dolby 2.0 Surround, while Region 2 and Region 4 got nice 16:9 widescreen release with Dolby Digital 5.1 surround sound, Commentary track, behind the scenes footage and more for HALF THE PRICE!!! 9.99 EUR which is $12.93 at time of writing this.If you can import the R2 or R4 version it's worth it. This version was a disappointment.I love the movie, but way to let me down Monarch Video."
2,"Good, but...","This movie was pretty good. But it's impossible to NOT compare to Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels and Snatch. It's basically the same thing. Lock, Stock involved poker, Snatch had boxing, and this one is about pool. All of them with your stereo-type gangster that is trying to screw the heroes out of money and at the same type keep 'em down so they know who is boss. Eventually I'll buy this one, just have a bunch ahead in the list."
1,Stickmen,This movie really stinks and the pool shooting what there is of it really stinks. This movie is not worth the film is was put on and any APA member could beat anyone of these guys on a table.
2,Stickmen,"My husband said it was an okay movie. But he's only watched it once since over a year ago when I got it for him. He said it was similar to some other movie he saw once, and the other movie was better. (if he remembers the name of the other movie I'll edit this and add the title)"
3,Good enough,If you like Pool or anything pool related movie is worth checking out. There arent too many Billiards movies out. This movie was made in New Zealand. At first the Aussie/Zealand accent was a bit weird but then I adjusted. This appears to be a low budget type of deal but its pretty well made an Directed. I think its worth a watch an enjoyed it enough. Im not a big movie person but i have watched it 3 times in past 7 or 8 months. That's a rarity for me as i cant normally stand watching a movie more than once.
3,Not exactly The Hustler,"Decent beer-swilling fare. Some acceptable laughs. But alas, the pool shooting is weak; if you're gonna call it Stickmen, let's see some shots as good as the Hustler or Color Of Money, please.A guy's flick, and not a bad one. But not a very good one either.Rack 'em up again."
3,Stickmen,"I found this movie to be more of a comedy than a drama. The pool matches were set up more like the APA/TAP League than your ordinary 1-vs-1 tournament style matches. Never-the-less, my 3 star rating is directed on the plot of the movie and not on the actual pool shooting or the footage of the shots."
2,Beautiful but dim,"The pluses: This makeup mirror is beautiful, the oval shape and the combination satin nickel and chrome finish is elegant and would probably go with any decor. The magnification level is great; anything more would be too much. The minuses: the touch on/off feature. I thought it would be convenient, but quite the opposite. Cleaning the mirror, moving it over, accidentally bumping it, my cat rubbing on it, everything turns it on. The light it produces, which I think is a primary function of a makeup mirror, is too dim. There are three settings, but even at the brightest one I have to have my other bathroom lights on to see well enough to pluck my eyebrows. If I had known the pros and cons when I bought it, I would not have gotten this one."
2,Not what I had hoped for...,"I was lured into buying this due to all the great reviews people had put up and when I got the product I was sorely disappointed. First, if you have the new style passport (the one with the RFID chip in it) you will have a hell of a time getting this in to the cover as you can't bend the passport covers without damaging the electronics in it. Second, the quality of the leather is ok at best. nothing to rave about. Finally, inside there was some plastic covers to hold it in and they were covered with some kind of black dust that if you hadn't noticed it and slipped your passport in would gotten all over the passport. So overall, a disappointment."
5,Passport cover,My secretary passed her US citizenship test and I wanted to buy her something special for her upcoming trip to her hometown of Columbia. I purchased the pink one. It came in the condition promised and she loved it.
4,Leather Passport Cover,"This was an entirely successful transaction. It was handled quickly and efficiently. I bought the Passport Cover for my Housekeeper who has recently passed her Citizenship Test. I thought the cover looked so good, I ordered another two - for me and my traveling companion. I agree with a previous reviewer who wished that the covers could be personalized. This would make it a really unique gift and be even more acceptable. I have seen this in one of the Catalogs."
4,OK,"The brown leather passport holder held up well, and my boyfriend really likes it.The pink one that I received has already started falling apart.Not too pricey... OK quality."
3,Lettering worn on cover,"Not the best quality, a bit flimsy but does its job. The gold stamp was also uneven making it also look cheap."
2,Embossing,"I believe the manufacturer/vendor needs a lesson on the definition of embossing.1 Carve or mold a design on (a surface) so that it stands out in relief: ""an embossed brass dish"".2 Decorate (a surface) with a raised design.This is a flat surface with some printed letters on it. Embossing is classy, this design is not."
2,Not the one I expected,"The quality of material and its flexibility does not permit good print jobs, so the edges of printed Passport and Logo are not crisp and clear, however it might be due to leather anyway next time I will pick up a vinyl product that has crisp and clear appearance of printed material on it (logo and letters)"
3,"It's OK, works as described, but not the most attractive.","For the price, this is a good buy. It's leather, and soft and seems to be pretty well made. The shortcomings are the tacky gold lettering on the cover (printed, not embossed). I have the dark blue/navy cover and it is close to the color of the actual US passport.The inside has two clear pockets for the front and back covers of the passport. These work fine, and you have to bend the passport cover backwards to get it in the leather cover. My issue with these little pockets is the unnecessarily large colored trim on the the end. A finer trim would have been much nicer here - instead it is very noticeable.I bought this as an added layer of protection for my passport as it gets tossed around during travel. I can't speak to the need to remove the passport from the cover for customs inspection, but given the plastic flap with the large colored trim I am fully expecting to have to take it out. All in all, it's functional but just OK."
4,Embossed Leather Passport Cover,"I purchased this product for my wife since she became a U.S Citizen recently. The leather seems to be of a good quality, however the color did not seem as projected. I bought the pink one and the color was not as vivid as in the picture at all, instead it was a dusty pink. She kept it anyways. Otherwise fits the passport nicely and you don't need to take the passport off every time you cross a border, because the inside is see thru, which is important."
3,For Beginer Backstreet Fans,"This Book Would Be Great To Read If You Just Started Liking The Backstreet Boys. There Is Information In It, But Not Enough To Please An Obsessed Backstreet Fan Like Myself. The Pics In It Are Not That Fab. There Is One That Makes A.J. Look Like He Has Mascara On, One Has Brian's Teeth Looking Fake, The Funniest Picture Is Of HowieD Wearing A Woman's Shirt!(ha ha). The Book Was Written In Early '98 So A Lot Of The Stuff Is Very Out-Dated. I Love Backstreet Boys But This Book Is A Definate No Go."
1,Good book but needs more!,"I bought this book while I was waiting in the airport! I had heard it was realy good!! The second I saw it I bought!! I was suprised how thin the book was!! I stuffed it in my back pac and went to the plane. I took it out and started to read it but, some of the info I knew they had switched around! It was really annoying!! The pic's were cool, but the book itself really wasn't that good!! I think the author needed to do their homework on BSB!!!"
2,NOT ENOUGH INFO!!!,"This book does not give enough info on BSB. Nice pics, but not enough info. If you like to buy books on BSB, buy it, but if you want a book that gives info, trash it."
2,Not the best book on the BSB!,"This book is okay to get if you just like buying books on the BSB. The information in the book is a bit wrong and it really doesn't go in to detail. Although the pictures aren't bad there is NOT enough information in this book. If you are looking for a book where you want to learn a lot more personal things about the group, I have read a lot of other books that are better."
3,Hangin' With The Backstreet Boys,I thought this was a really good book BUT some of the info was a LITTLE wrong! But hey everyone makes mistakes! The pictures are AWESOME! But it didn't have ENOUGH info!
4,Curacao Troubadour,"Oswin ""Chin"" Behilia is verifiably an authentic ""troubadour"" of Curacao music and cultural expression. Chin's music has for years been identified as having a high level of production and engineering values , thereby beautifully presenting the songs and lyrics in clear, crisp and finely mastered style.Some of his songs are also ""classics"" of the Curacao music scene.You will not be dis-appointed in any of Chin Behilia's records."
4,A theosophical treatment of alcoholism.,"Dr.Baker's cooperation with David Lane represents the blended effort of an esotericist and a recovering alcoholic to provide a guide to alcoholism.This is a unique,theosophical treatment of the problem,taking into account factors such as karma,the etheric body,the astral body,also the soul's purpose and the deeper meanings of alcoholism and its subtle effects on a number of occult components of the afflicted.Very interesting, though short are the flower remedies recommended for the recovering alcoholic.The picture emerging from this kind of treatment is one of hope for the addict and enlightenment for the esoteric healer."
1,This book is insult to anyone reading it!!!,"This book might of as well listed ""Finding your Husband in bed with another women!"" The Auther treats the reader as if they don't have a brain to formulate an idea. This book is nothing more than a ""Keen observation of the quite obvious!"" After looking through this book I was not sure if this was a real help book or a Novelty joke calendar. It is an insult to the readers intelligence! The time i spent reading it is lost forever, dont make the same mistake i did!"
3,cheating signs,The book was purchased for a friend of mine.It's soft cover and thin but a good guide for the do and don't s in investigating a cheating spouse.Mostly it confirms what you see in print so you stop living in denial and become proactive in your approachrather than inactive.
1,Need a crimp tool,I didn't realize that you need the crimp tool to properly install these.... I have not yet tried just a pair of pliers yetbut that's what's coming... so that's why such a low rating...
5,basics of healthy eating - loved it!,"The book consists of 20 chapters, with every chapter dealing with one topic (like ""drink pure water"", ""cut down on meat of all kinds"", ""cut back on salt"").The authors explain why you should cut back on so much or why certain things are that important in clear, understandable language. Although many things might not really be new to you (cut back on sugars and alcohol), you are starting to see what's good and bad much more clearly. I considered myself a healthy eater, but now I see there's still a lot I can change!"
3,Stories from Rural India,"A collection of short stories from India with a lot of local color. I'll call them ""mood stories:"" a lot of atmosphere but very little plot. In the title story, a young, artistic man grows up observing his neighbors and neighborhood and develops a crush on a young woman who is dying. He mainly sees her on family visits and makes artistic gifts for her. This is old India, so it's not like they are going to run up to the bedroom and close the door. Another story is a bit of a ghost story focused on an old house. Another is almost a medieval tale of a laborer who steals a peacock for his daughter from the royal zoo. In another story, a death leads to a family melee over the deceased's jewelry. There is some elegant writing but little action or even psychological depth. The stories are translated from Urdu, the language of Pakistan, but these tales are set in northeast India where that language is also spoken."
3,Size confusion,"I thought when I ordered this lovely print that the size was going to be 14 x 11, not including borders. The actual print is 11 x 8, so it looks a bit odd in my prematted frame. The quality is OK. Amazon was very understanding when I explained my confusion."
3,"""Angels With Dirty Faces"" out west","Boyhood pals Rock Hudson and Dean Martin grow up to live on opposite sides of the law in this entertaining Western that is a sort of variation on the theme of 1938's ""Angels With Dirty Faces"" with Martin taking over for James Cagney and Hudson stepping in for Pat O' Brien. Although, like a lot of Universal ""product"" at the time, it has TV stamped all over it (and both of the stars were headlining NBC shows during this period), and it was probably intended as nothing more than a fulfillment of a feature film clause in Hudson's ""McMillan and Wife"" contract with the studio, it somehow reaches beyond its modest beginnings to become something a little deeper and of higher quality than was perhaps intended."
1,Don't Bother With this One,The acting in this movie appears forced and is not very good.--It is not a good western. Looks like one that was made to fufill an obligation on an contract or something. Dean is at his lowest in this one. Western fans--Avoid this one!!!!!!
5,Awesome Trucking Tunes!,"Great Collection of Trucking Songs all in ONE CD!!! Looked for the Bobby Bare Song ""Six Days Back at Home"" everywhere & this was the only place I found it!"
1,Not even useful as Toilet Paper.,"Just... plain... suck. The opening scene mistakeningly promised a much better book, but once the prologue was over, so was my interest.It seemed that the Author decided to write ~200 Pages of Story, and added a filler statement relating to how the main character thinks she is fat between every sentance of dialogue.Speaking of the Fat thing, if the Main Character had such insecurity problems about her weight as the Author insinuates, shouldn't Freddy have played on that? If she hates being Fat, that opens up some great (and completely unused) Nightmare ideas.Freddy also ""forsakes"" the glove towards the end of the book, stating ""I don't need it anymore"". The hints at School killings being more than they were to end the book was not only cliche, but boring.All-in-all, I am a Nightmare fan, I would have read it anyway, but this novel will just collect dust. In closing, I URGE you not to read this book unless you absolutely must."
4,Pretty good!,"Well i went into it sureit would be great with an author like christa and it was! somethings were diaappointing though: No elm street, didnt get that ""Nightmare on elm street"" feel.but all in all a great read i could barely put it down with out yanking it up and seeing who dies next!"
2,Ehh...,This book didn't do much for me. Suffer The Children and Protege had me hooked instantly. This book seemed like it took forever to get things going. Some parts were so down-right boring I actually skimmed thru just to see if anything interesting was going to happen.
5,Great Replacement,I use a cable with 7-blade ends as the connection between the RV and the Toad car. We had been using a Blue Ox cable with the 4-pin plugs replaced with 7-blade plugs but the spring in the coils had petered out. A replacement cable from Blue Ox would have been $65.This Hopkins cable at $28 was for more cost effective especially since one end already had a 7-nlade plug on it.Icing on the cake is the LED inside the translucent plug that light when the running lights are on.
2,cautios!!!,"F.Babinger is a well-known historian but quite biased on this subject...Try Steven Runciman's The Fall of Constantinople, Nicolae Iorga's Ottoman History and Halil inalcik's works on Ottoman history..."
2,Dark,"I really wanted to like these, and unfortunately I bought all three. I'm a sci-fi buff, I love angels especially the Archangel St. Michael who is the leader in this series, and I'm always looking for something that will help my children embrace divine messages. I had hoped this would be a sort of sci-fi, teenage Veggie Tales. But that was not to be the case. I first watched this without my children. I thought it was awfully dark both visually and story wise, and I had trouble paying attention. Given that, I still decided to I let my children watch it. Granted, they are only 7 and 4 years old, but they didn't like it. When I tried to put it on a second time, they said ""No, not angels!"" Wow, that's not something I wanted to hear come out of their mouths."
1,very poor,"I bought this based on the actors. This is early in their careers and they do a poor performance. The audio commentary is equally poor. I am an amateur historian of this period and found the commentators very ill informed. I agree with the commentators that this should have been in black and white.As far as the quality of the script, it is no where near that of The Third Man or The Spy Who Came in From the Cold.It is one of many poor me toos cashing in on the success of early spy movies. Many professional critics also think that this is a poor movie."
1,Not worth seeing.,"George Segal is a good actor, but he is out of his element in this type of movie. He is much better in light-hearted movies like ""Fun With Dick and Jane.""The biggest disappointment is the dialog by Harold Pinter. The characters exchange meaningless small talk at cross purposes while nothing happens, and we all get bored.This spy movie is not even in the same league with ""Day of the Jackel"" and ""The Odessa File.""I threw away my copy of ""The Quiller Memorandum"" after watching it once. I can't imagine ever wanting to see it again."
2,a travesty,"When you deviate significantly from a pretty good cold war novel with a good serial character in a good series and then miscast the hero this badly, nothing can make up for it. Segal is not credible except in his usual fluffy comedy roles; e.g, ""Who is Killing the Great Chefs of Europe"" which I highly recommend, especially if you like to cook, but he's not a cold warrior. Here's a Segal quote from that Chefs movie: ""I can't even boil a pizza."""
2,Quiller Got Lost on the Way Home,"The Quiller Memorandum takes place back during the cold war. It represented a time and place in history that was true at that time. It accurately depicts an era that is now gone, that some of us lived through.The movie, by today's standards, is a little disjointed and incomplete.It jumps to a conclusion but lacks story development how it got there. Some scenes must have been edited on the cutting room floor back in the 60's or 70's in order to get a G or GP rating. As a result of those incomplete or cut scenes, part of the movie makes no sense. The movie would have been better served if it were produced closer to the author's original book.The most memorable part of the movie is the haunting score, including Matt Monroe's ""Wednesday's Child"". I was disappointed in viewing this movie again some 20 or 30 years later. Perhaps Wolfe was right when he said that we can never go home again. Quiller must have gotten lost on his way home!"
4,The Quiller Memorandum,"It's what you expect a espionage story to be intriquing and suspenseful, however; it wasn't as thrilling as the Jason Bourne and Harry Palmer series but more realistic than the James Bond fantasy of sex and gadgets."
4,Buy it but not from these jerks,"This is a good album. Do not, however, pay $40 for it like half of these scammers are charging when you can get it for $10 on best buy's website. It's not rare or collectible."
5,The original and best,"Accept no substitutes. Rabbit Habits and Six Demon Bag are great albums, they really are. This one sounds the most ""pure"" however. If you are just getting into Man Man or already have one of their albums, I highly recommend this one. ""Gold Teeth"" is easily one of the most beautiful songs ever, the subtlety of the percussion takes several listens on good headphones to discern."
3,too difficult to understand the whole idea,too difficult to understand the whole ideaand cannot understand the models in the book
1,How to throw away your money.,"Utterly, gloriously, preposterously illiterate. Shouldn't you go to college before you write an expose of it?"
5,Nice scent!,"I love huggies wipes, they don't fall apart like pampers wipes. They're thick and strong. The scent of these was something I thought I wouldn't like, but it's really very light and pleasant! My baby is 9 weeks old, and they don't bother his skin at all, either, so they're gentle. Can't beat the price, and I like not having to buy so many tubs to throw away, too."
4,Great for diaper change and general cleaning,"I used to use the seven generation wipes, it got too expensive. then i switched to costco kirkland brand which i like, but because it is so soft and thin that it doesn't wipe well w/ #2. Ever since I switched to this brand, the scented smell and strong sturdy wipes makes my baby fell fresh and every time. Not only do I use them on my baby, I also use them to clean and dust around the house."
4,good wipes !,these wipes are pretty good...they are better than pampers brand and softer than store brand...to smelly though...if i wipe my kids hands with it they are left with the taste of the smelly stuff...but they are great for cleaning up #2
3,"Good wipes, but I really don't like the smell","The wipes are good quality and strong, but I don't like the smell. If it were more faint, I would like the product more."
4,I Love my catbus!,"I Love my cat bus...because it IS a cat bus. Not the BEST quality, but i still LOVE it! Would like to buy a couple more, but the price is too high."
5,boy loves it!,perfect on all counts... would buy again...thanks for making our son so happy....keep up the great work...happy holidays! and a great new year!
2,sharp edges,I bought this product because the ad said it was made to be super comfortable...NOT. The so called padded closure has sharp edges on the top and the bottom that scratches. Very UNcomfortable.
1,Horrible horrible horrible. Do not buy!,I hated this bra. Fit was terrible. Material was itchy and extremely uncomfortable. Made my girls look like they were trying to escape to the floor.
2,Don't Like the FIt On Me,"This bra looks nice, good quality, is comfy, but doesn't fit me well as far as the cup goes. Seems to pull my girls down. I want to keep them up where they belong! I do not like the shape of this bra at all, not for me."
2,"Straps too short, bandds made small","I'm barely 5""4"" and the shoulder straps on this model - when set to as long as they can be - are a tad short so that brand new this bra pulls up the portion that goes across your back. I went back over to Victoria's Secret bra measuring guide before posting this just to be sure I wasn't off. I'd ordered the right size but the band that hooks in back is also made small, the cups are fine. These do not follow standard bra measuring guidelines."
5,Love it,I just love this bra. The best fitting bra ever. Looks and feel good. I couldn't find a 36DD in store. Order a DD and No more skin popping out. Now i can wear skin tight t-shirt. I ordered 3 more.
1,Very uncomfortable!!,"I usually wear Bali bras, and have several of this style, thought that these were the same as the ones that I have, and these are not.The ones that I had bought before came from a retail store and look just like these, except the other ones had the stretchy shoulder straps, that make them far more comfortable. These are very uncomfortable because the shoulder straps are not stretchy at all, so they dig into my shoulders, and they do not move with you at all. They just plain hurt! Which is not good.It would have been great if they mentioned that the shoulder straps are not made of stretchy material, had I known in advance, I wouldn't have ordered them."
3,not very comfortable,"Provides good support but it is not very comfortable. The cups are cut very high and the underarm area also is high, making the bra rub into the arm pit."
1,WORST BRA EVER!!!,"THIS IS BY FAR THE WORST BRA THAT I HAVE EVER, EVER PURCHASE... AFTER HAVING A BABY I WAS LOOKING FOR SOMETHING THAT WOULD BE ABLE TO GIVE ME SUPPORT AND COMFORT, AND THIS BRA FALLS WAY SHORT ON ITS PROMISE ON EITHER. I THOUGHT THAT AFTER READING SUCH 'GOOD' REVIEWS ON THIS BRA THAT I HAVE FINALLY FOUND WHAT I WAS LOOKING FOR BUT I WAS PROVEN WRONG.MY HUSBAND AND I WAS SO DISGUSTED WE LITERALLY WENT INTO THE BCKYARD AND LITE IT ON FIRE!!! CHEAP BUT NOT EVEN WORTH A PENNY!!!!"
4,"Great quality, huge cups","I love this bra. When I first saw it, I thought it wouldn't fit because the cups were just so big, but in fact it fit, even though the cups could be smaller. That would make this the perfect bra. The quality is awesome, a really solid product."
5,Most comfortable bra,"My customers just love this bra. It has a soft & supportive band under the bust.It has a padded back hook & eye section, front adjustable straps.Feedback I get from my customers ...""love it""""the most comfortable bra I have ever worn"""
4,Nice Bra,I have bought a few of these over the years. It is a bit of a granny bra with 4 hooks (I am sure due to my larger size) which takes a while to get used to. Otherwise it is a nice bra. Comes in different colors which is nice and they don't cost an arm and a leg.
3,Good support but Too thin in the cups.,"Unfortunately I canno wear it. The material is scratchy at the back an around, and it is too thin at cups, no padding. So I cant wear it outside due to visible nipple marks. It is supportine bra but not comfortable to wear. Wish I could return it, but I took off the lables."
3,Great Support,Superb support for a wire free bra. Only negative is that I would prefer that no lace.
5,"Great bra with perfect fit, purchased on Amazon",I've been wearing this bra for 10 years. Can't find any other to match it for fit or quality. They last forever.
4,Bali Spa Closure Bra,"My wife was extremely pleased with this product. It was attractive, comfortable and well worth the price. It offered average support for a wire-less bra."
4,bali bra comfort,"the fit of the bra was excellent, but the thread on the back hooks was slightly irritating. Felt like the stiff plastic type thread. otherwise an pretty good buy!"
4,bali bra,wonderful fit very comfortable can say enough nice things about this brand have tried many others will stick with bali great product
2,Double Support???,"I just received this bra in the mail, and I have to say, I was expecting better. It lifted me up a little, but it didn't hold anything in hardly at all. I'm a 34C."
4,Comfort,"My wife found this item very comfortable and supportive, it is also fairly sexy and attractive."
5,Hard to find locally,It's impossible to find my size locally but Amazon always has several to choose from. I even had a few choices in color! Really happy with the quality and the price.
4,Good fit,"Like the product. Only complaint is that the material is very itchy. I always was bras before I wear them for the first time, but even after the first was the material was still itchy."
3,Pretty pictures,"The scenery is great. The photography is great. The actual fishing time is fairly short. There isn't really anything in the way of show and tell, how-to, or gear time. I love to hear people talk about how and why they're doing what they're doing and discuss the gear they're using; none of that here.If you want pretty pictures and fly-by's ... this is for you. If you're looking for something like ""Successful Fly Fishing Strategies"" by Lafontaine and Sharron, you'll be disappointed."
5,nice cd,"this is a nice cd.i enjoy listening to dolly sing most anything.love the songs on the particular cd,and so glad to receive it."
5,It's All Here In 64 Minutes,"Dolly Parton is one of those artist's where the persona almost eclipses her true talent. We've seen her taking jabs from Johnny Carson. We've seen her try her hand at acting. And we've seen her play second fiddle to some guy named Porter. Here you get 20 slices of American apple pie. Dolly for what Dolly truly is----a fine singer of songs. From her self-penned classics ""Jolene"" and ""I Will Always Love You"" , to her duets with Kenny Rogers and Emmylou Harris (the ""To Know Him Is to Love Him"" cover is nothing short of brilliant) , and everything else in between. Great overview of a great career."
2,Another mix of the same old songs!,"In a career which has spanned four decades, why must BMG keep releasing the same songs over and over again? Dolly's actual involvement in this project makes it ""more official"" than other discs but there is still room for improvement! BMG should go back into their vaults and release new CD's of Dolly's older work with the original arkwork and packaging. That's what Dolly fans want. I wonder when they will start listening to us?"
3,Just one disc?,"When I hear the titel ""ultimate""....I think of a great bunch of songs (which Dolly has for sure). I wonder why they only release one disc. Dolly has so many more songs that should be on a compilation called ""ultimate""! If this was the german release of the compilation I d rate it with 5 stars. cos the german release has 36 songs on 2 discs. I wonder why they dont release the 2 disc version in the US. So be sure if you d rather buy the US release or the German release. oh and the UK release (also one disc) has one bonus track ""Early Morning Breeze"" (Remix by Bent Feat. B.J.Cole) !!!As a big Dolly fan I miss more re-releases of her older albums instead of one compilation after the other one.greetz, Mario"
4,Wonderful - And I'm not a Dolly Fan,The Lady has put together some of her best songs over the last 30 years on one CD. The pnotos alone are worth the cost of the CD. I can't help it; Dolly can tug at my heart like few other singers (even with her annoying put on twang).
4,"Confusing, but Good","What is the Pigman's Legacy? I can't figure it out! It'sfrustrating. However, the book itself was pretty cool."
1,balah and blah and blah,"I hate how this story is an exact mirror of the first story. No details, two stupid teenagers that are always getting tragically mixed up with dying old men, and the only new element,: A crazy lunch lady with weird style"
3,Touching and simply beautiful,"I hate sequels and seconds. They usually never live up to the original, with the exception of The Godfather, Part II and Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan. This sequel to The Pigman is also another exception of the very few good seconds to a movie or book. Zindel again writes the book at the two teenager's point of view. They've come across another old man about four months after the last time they've seen Mr. Pignati. Soon they're on a car ride to Atlantic City, about to hit the big bucks.I feel that this book has just about the same kind of emotion and distinguishness as the first. Trust me --- you'll enjoy this book. Zindel wrote it straight from the heart."
5,Medieval Exuberance,Anyone who enjoys alternative instrumentation to upbeat music will enjoy the energy of this CD. It creates a perfect atmosphere for concentration.
2,Late Bloomers Need History Lesson,"This is not a review, but a warning that early on, the book will lose its credibility. There is a profile of Harry Truman - one of the late bloomers. The author (I assume) has the years of Harry Trumans presidency wrong. Bad enough the book tilts to the literary/art crowd (guess all those failed authors are being hopeful), but no one at the publisher caught this. A problem for those publishing executives that only took english lit courses is that they have ignored the basic facts of history"
2,Didn't Speak to Me,"Most of the folks in this book are people you've already heard of; in addition, most are men. I was looking for a book on lesser-known individuals who had peaked later in life - this is NOT that book!"
3,Late Bloomers?,"When I think of late bloomers, I think of someone who hasn't used their full potential for most of their life. Most of the people profiled had success of one type or another early in life Many worked hard many years in their field to achieve the fame that they ultimately obtained later in life. For instance, Alice Hamilton and Mother Teresa both worked in their chosen fields early in life and their dedication to their early chosen field propelled them to do great things. In Mother Teresa's case she was forty when she opened her Missions of Charity but it was a continuation of a life of service. Others like Grandma Moses, who took up painting at age 76, were profiled and were more inline with what one might define ""late bloomers,"" While it was an interesting book to read, it really didn't do the title justice."
1,Software Looks Old,"I recently purcahsed this item and it is [not worth much]. It looks old, like the windows programs of the early 90's. It has a limited amount of recipes and the overall use of its other futures are very basic. Try one of the other recipe software items. It has got to be better than this."
1,Gourmet Cooking Suite,"This program sounds very good on the cover. When you open it, there are several programs, which make you feel as if you get alot for your money. However, there are serious flaws in the exercise/diet program. There is difficulty saving material. It often will shut down just as you are planning your menus. It may be a deal at 10 dollars, but not the 20 dollars originally asked."
1,This thing is terrible!,"I bought this thinking that it would be great to keep my 1 year old from slipping and sliding around the tub and also would not mildew like the traditional bath mats. Well, there is no way to keep the thing from floating! And it says it is long enough to cover the entire tub and it is not. It covers about half. Then you have to fight with keeping it down while you try to bathe your child. Definitely not worth the money I spent on it!"
4,Very good book that have helped me greatly as a man,"It has been great to go through each chapter day by day and learn something new plus it has been super refreshing for me being newly wedded. It was a book that i read while starting up my life here in Korea. I would like to suggest this book for all you men out there. I do not find this book tooo much in any way, but super easy to read and very balanced while it is cutting right to thencore of it allVery very good devotionalEmil"
5,An inspiration to and for REAL men.,"I shared this book with a couple of friends this past Christmas. It was my way of spreading the Gospel and telling them that it does pay to serve a true living God. Before giving it as a gift, I read it and it said all the things women want men to know about who they should be as men in Christ. The one message that resonates is that you must be in the place where your blessings are to receive them. God is waiting on men to come to that place, the blessing is already there. Bless Bishop Jakes for that insight."
4,"4 stars cause i like it, but the average person may hate it (1-2)","it was originally advertised as (an over the top) conspracy movie in the near future with opera music playing in the background. if you have that in mind, and you still watch it, you're ok. if you've never seen a preview, buy it and start watching you may be amazed that it was even finished. the acting is way over the top in many places and most of the main characters are people you would hate in real life (adulterers, pushy weasels, etc) but they are all extremists on opposite sides of a conspiracy so that works in this operatic show. someone noted the music was over the top, but again it fits the movie and it was made a while back when every other show seemed to have a music video going on as people drove down the road. So in short, if youve never seen in and want to buy it: its dramatic and over the top and old... find a trailer if you want, youve been warned."
2,Are you people insane?,"My Girlfriend and I just finished the last episode, and this was a horrible *horrible* show. A lot of motivations go unexplained, the acting is bad -especially Belushi, who has no range whatsoever. The actors try to convince you that your looking at a world rife with cultural, spiritual and political tension, but it just doesn't work. You don't feel it at all.It's painfully obvious someone wanted to make their own version of Twin Peaks but failed. I have to commend the effort, but to give this series anything above 3 stars is ludicrous. Only watch this movie if you want to yell at James Belushi for 5 hours."
1,omg & wtf!,"i bought this dvd set at a huge discount. i remember the series was out years ago and never followed it. and i got to say, what a mess. although based on a graphic novel, or comic, it seems like oliver stone's answer to Twin Peaks that finished up earlier. stone was clearly trying to imitate Twin Peaks and Blue Velvet and bombed in so doing. i'm amazed at how many positive reviews this has. none of the actors were strong, the music was over dramatic, using everything from Bethoven's 7th to the Animals and Rolling Stones. angie dickinson as a thug? come on! it was embarrassing to watch her: gouge someone's eyes out, bitch slap and gut punch another. cattrell was equally miscaste and her dramatic cry of ""it's my baby!"" was laughable. in trying to be bizarre, it failed miserably. there isn't any level that i would recommend this series. buy it used if you must waste your money."
2,No Cigar,When this product arrived it was missing the first of a 2 disk set. My plans to enjoy the mini series was placed on hold while I awaited the replacement. Left me a bit bitter.
4,Dated but fun,"1993's 'Wild Palms' isn't as edgy these days as it was twelve years ago - in fact, now that the virtual reality fad of the late '80s/early '90s has faded, the series is something of a period piece - but it's still an interesting take on the collision of government, technology, and religion. Great cast, too. Robert Loggia in particular delivers a jaw-droppingly over-the-top performance; no corner of the scenery is left unchewed, but he manages to make it work. I love Sakamoto's theme, but I have the feeling that he phoned the soundtrack in (maybe literally, as it's all synth and was apparently ""realized"" by someone else). Nice transfer, and an improvement over the crappy VHS version. And the price is certainly right.In reply to an earlier reviewer's comment: Some of us think '12 Monkeys' is an improvement on 'La Jetee.' And 'Wild Palms' may not be top-drawer SF (arguably, '12 Monkeys' is precisely that), but it's fun to watch and I'm glad it's finally out on DVD."
5,Haven't been able to forget...,I remember seeing this mini series when I was 13 years old. Ever since then I haven't been able to get it's images out of my mind. It is an awesome movie and a great cast. I would recommend this movie to anyone who wants to dive into fantasy and get lost in it's wonders.
1,Cat in a Leopord Spot: A Midnight Louie Mystery,"I was very excited to find a cat mystery series but was very disappointed when I started reading. The author jumps around so much it is hard to follow and keep interested. Also had a difficult time deciding which character was ""talking"" or ""thinking"". I put the book aside after only reading a very few chapters."
4,So This is Mystery,"Before Midnight Louie I had never read one single mystery. Then I got a cat named Louie, (most unlike the Midnight P.I.) but went off on a tear with these books. I happen to be getting very aware of the sanctuaries devoted to caring for abused, abandoned and neglected big cats, so this one had to be read out of order. She does a very creditable job describing the true plight of the big cats in horrible situations while somehow allowing Louie to lose none of his charm and swagger. Oh, yes, the human characters are interesting too! May help if you've visited Las Vegas, but not strictly necessary, her (and Louie's) descriptions are great."
5,Another Great album by the planet smashers,You would think that following the album life of the party would be impossible. Well the planet smashers did it. They made another great album. buy this album and you won't regret it.
2,An incomplete story,"The Madonnas of Leningrad could have been a terrific book but somewhere along the line the author decided to concentrate on the Alzheimer's and left out what happened at the end of the war, how the paintings were retrieved, details about how the couple found each other again (more than just a couple of paragraphs!). It was frustrating that so much was glossed over or ignored and we never find out what really happened!"
4,Great to read on a flight to St. Petersburg,"A friend recommended this book because she enjoyed it and knew I was headed to St. Petersburg. I also really enjoyed reading it. It enriched my experience of the Hermitage and I may skim it again now that I've seen the museum. Also, I keep thinking about some of the deeper issues of memory, identity, adversity and family that it raised. I especially think about how little we really know about the life experience of our elders."
5,"Beautiful, Haunting Story","Wow, LOVED this story. Very hard to put down. If you love art (or even if you don't, this author might tempt you to!) and history, this historical novel delivers. The horrible seige of Leningrad (now renamed St Petersburg as it was before the Communists) is a tale in itself, but the story of the famous museum the Hermitage, is another saga. Combining them both makes this move superb. I'm now researching more about both topics...she peaked my curiosity!"
3,"banal prose, flat characters","The author must be commended for the idea of this novel, which is excellent. And I do not know how many novelists have attempted to write from the point of view of a person with Alzheimers. Again, commendable. However, the prose in this book is so predictable and turgid that at several times during my reading I looked up and say to my husband, ""I hate this book."" Twice on the same page, the author describes different parts of the lobby of the Hermitage as ""a confection"". I've been there, and yeah, it's gilded overmuch, but should the prose be also? People in this book ""stare blankly"" or even ""stonily,"" they are ""mesmerized by awful beauty,"" etc. etc. Perhaps I have been spoiled; I just read ""City of Thieves"", a much better book set in Leningrad during the seige."
4,The Madonnas of Leningrad,"Had to read it quickly for book group so perhaps I am being unfair. There is a lot to think about, which is always good. Many layers."
4,Not our best choice,"Our book club choose this one for our November selection. A couple of our members gave it 4 stars, but most only 2 - 3"
4,Sweet and Economical,"A one-sit read, it is a tender story that does not delve too deeply into developing its characters nor the events unfolding around them. It's probably more a 3-1/2 stars for the total read, but Marina's last tour through the Hermitage is absolutely transcendent, so four stars it is."
5,A Memory Palace Back to Reality,"This is a beautiful strange mixture of a sad, poignant tale of a beautiful young women in Leningrad in 1941 awaiting the German takeover and her life now as an old woman who is fighting dementia and remembering the horror and beauty of that time.The author has a wonderful grasp of art history and critique and uses that knowledge extensively as she tells of Marina's memories of that time in Russia when just before the imminent arrival of the Germans, she was a docent at the Hermitage Museum. The recollection of these countless paintings is her link to the past and her link to her sanity.It is a beautiful prosaic story."
4,exceptional writing,"A book which captures the imagination. Characters are fictional, yes, however seem believable. Because the story is based on the history of Leningrad and the Hermitage,there is a dimension to the writing which is not often captured in most novels."
2,not what I was hoping for,"There are some pretty turns of phrases, but this book cannot decide what it is.Is it about Alzheimer's disease? Well, possibly. Is it about surviving the siege? Possibly.But I bought this believing that I'd have a unique approach to a woman's struggle during the long, devastating siege of Leningrad by the Germans. It does in that it touches on people starving, people dying, but the general focus is on her tenure as a guide (and packer) at the Hermitage and what her speeches were to this and that group. It attempts to be mystical and misses the mark. This book didn't hold together well for me.Chapters shifted back and forth between Marina's Russian life and her old age as her memory is receding...and the problems her husband has with her...and her daughter's lonely and complicated life...and you probably get the idea.The madonnas of the story are paintings."
5,Madonnas of Leningrad,I never finished the book. I just couldn't get into it. But it did arrive on time.
2,Slow,It took a long time to get there. Other books I ordered weeks later than this book arrived in less than a week. This book took almost three weeks.
2,The Madonnas of Leningrad,"The history in the book was interested; however, the story was very slow. If you have someone in your family with Alzheimer's, you really do not want to read this book."
2,Watch Where You Step,"The author is a great writer but I'm not sure what she thought this story was supposed to be about. Was it about the ravages of Alzheimer's disease? The saving of the precious artwork at Hermitage during the Siege of Leningrad? Marina's escape to America?It was none of the above for me and I was expecting so much more based on the great reviews here. The author has left more gaping holes in this story which pretty much ruined it for me. There was way too much time spent on describing paintings and not enough about the birth of Marina's son, how and when did the artwork get returned to the Hermitage, what happened to Marina's aunt and uncles children who were sent away?The author did too much analyzing of the painting and completely missed the mark on this one. Save your money and borrow it from your local library."
3,The Madonna of Leningrad,I thought the author had great balance between the two time periods. Characters were well developed. It was a fast and entertaining read.
4,Poignant and Piquant,"This is a sad tale of the trials and hardships of war and old age woven amidst a wonderful story of enduring love. The reader is guided between the ravages of Russia during World War II and, in flickering snippets, modern day America where our heroine, Marina, is gradually losing her grasp on reality. I read the reviews that focus on the love story. I, however, find the poignancy in Marina's present day loss of faculties and her almost heroic efforts of survival in war-torn Leningrad, the main theme."
4,The Madonnas of Leningrad,"In this novel by Debra Dean, we get glimpses into both the life of those battling to survive in Leningrad in 1941, and the battle with Alzheimers.During WW2 as an employee of The Hermatige museum in Leningrad, Marina along with the other employees are emptying the museum of all of its treasures to try to ensure their safety during the war. Living in the basement with little to no food rations she hears the bombing outside and sees the devastation from her watch on the rooftop.In present day, we find an elderly Marina and her husband travelling to a family wedding. Battling Alzheimer's Marina scarcely remembers her own daughter, but she is gripped by these memories of 60+ years ago.The author does a wonderful job of blending these two times together with seamless transitions from one era to the next and back again. In addition to the main story we are treated to some wonderful information about the treasures that were housed at the Hermatige museum."
5,what a great experience,the book was amaizing. it came when i expected it all was great. I recommend this book to everyone. it is short and to the point. and a story that you will always remember
3,swept away,"I was pretty much swept away by this story. I enjoyed the non-linear plotting and all the layering involved. I thought constantly of the film Russian Ark and also a friend who was born in a displaced persons camp where his Russian artist parents ended up after the war. It rang true that the parents, having experienced such horrors, avoided the details with their children.However, the modern parts of the story seemed perfunctory, particularly in contrast with the richness of the historical portions. That's too bad - it cheats the reader. Marina's daughter lacks passion and intellectual curiosity, which seems false given some of her life choices. I wonder what sort of book it could have been if there were more balance in the presentation of the two eras. My three-star assessment is recognition of a great story idea told half-well: not great literature, not total chick-lit trash, ultimately worth reading."
3,Madonnas of Leningrad,Was loving the book until the end. Beautifully written and initially engaging. However end was abrupt and author could have developed main character with her family and her past. Ms. Dean missed a great opportunity. Disappointed due to the ending.
3,Two stories in one,"Two stories about the same woman during different times in her life seamlessly brought together into one. I enjoyed the individual stories, but found the metaphors and symbolism predictable and boring. I would have enjoyed reading two separate stories instead as both were interesting in, and of, themselves. Worth reading, but not what I had expected."
2,Big gaps in plot,The author is very perceptive and accurate in her depiction of the ravages of Alzheimer's disease. The description of the art works in the Hermitage museum in pre-war Leningrad is awesome but carried to an extreme in seemingly endless descriptions of art that needs to be seen to be fully appreciated. But the weakest element is the parts of the story that defy credibility. The birth of a perfect child after months of a starvation diet that results from the German siege of Leningrad after other babies had been stillborn or deformed. The timing of the birth had no significance to the plot as it unfolded and the reunion of mother and child with the father needed some explanation to make it credible. The premise of the story was interesting but the execution was disappointing.
3,Great idea for a novel,"Debra Dean had a wonderful idea for a novel, but the novel itself never lived up to my expectations for it. The setting, a museum in Leningrad during wartime, was new to me, and all the details - the food rationing, the artwork, the human misery during that time - were fascinating. Sadly though, the characters never felt as three-dimensional as the setting; the paintings felt more well rounded than the people walking among them. A beautiful title, a beautiful cover, and a beautiful idea for a novel---surely with just a little more editing, a little more work on the part of the author, an exceptional novel would have been published, rather than just this rather run-of-the-mill book."
2,Major disappointment,"Someone recommended this book and I expected a lot more that I got. I was really disappointed as I expected a good read but, alas, I was mistaken."
2,poor first novel,"i read this for our book club. I have many relatives from Russia. There was not enough history for an historic novel. Way too much description of The Hermitage art. Not enough about WWII history in Russia. The book should describe when Marina gave birth to Andrei, and how she left Russia. I will not read another book by Debra Dean. Few people in our book club liked this book. It was recommended by two artists. Maybe artists would enjoy the myriad descriptions of Hermitage madonnas."
1,The Madonnas of Leningrad: A Novel,Love this book. It has parts that are sad and so much you realize is true during the war. I can't believe that a lot this actually happened.
4,"Fine first effort, but ending was a bit of a cop-out","I would have liked the ending to include ""reveals"" and ""resolutions"" between the mother and daughter. I loved the details of the paintings in the Hermitage. That part of the story was poignant and evocative. But in the end, the mother never uses her memory palace to any benefit of post-war or internal war which makes her survival a hollow victory over war and death. It's as if her memory palace was boarded up and abandoned after so much work and struggle to preserve its treasures. In that way the ending of the story was unfufilling, and to my way of thinking a cop-out.But, please keep writing. And if you so desire, please read my novel and tell me what you think.""The Dressage Chronicles"" by Karen McGoldrick"
4,Madonnas of Leningrad,"Now I want to visit St Petersburg, especially the Hermitage Museum. I visited the Hermitage website during the read and found Marina's descriptions very accurate. The seige was described with compelling authenticity especially for and author who didn't visit the Hermitage until after she had finished writing the book. A very good historical novel."
5,Great pens,"I love these pens, and will be very upset when they are gone.I find them to be the most comfortable ballpoint pens I've ever used!"
1,A poor excuse for a security textbook,"This book has seen better days. The author appears to have cut-and-pasted hundreds of UNIX references into the book ""in order to beef it up..."" I assume. If you look at the references in the back of the textbook, many of them date from the mid-1980s. For example, his discussion of viruses and worms make NO reference to Code Red (or subsequent worms) but have extensive cut-and-paste data from a 1985 IEEE paper. You get the picture. Most of his other chapters are the same."
2,Not a big fan,"This was the textbook for one of my Comp Science grad courses and I didn't really care for it. I think it put way too much emphasis on modeling and theory and none at all on practical implementation. You will not be able to secure a network after reading this book. This book will give you some information on security theory and really would only benefit designers of systems in the 70s-80s or academics, not IT practitioners."
3,Readability,"The text appears to be detailed and comprehensive. As an introduction to computer security, there were a few assumptions made about the readers. Abbreviations used throughout the text were difficult to decipher. A common practice is to write out the terms with the abbreviations used in parentheses immediately following. I did not find this in the text, requiring me to reread the chapters several times to get a feel for what is being described. This includes statistical nomenclature. Students taking an introductory course may not have had statistics and not understand the symbols presented. For symbols, an appendix should have been included which defines those labels for readers. Otherwise, I have found the examples to bring meaning to the content. It was through the examples that I was able to grasp the intent of each chapter."
3,Intro a seguridad,Chapters in the book explain concepts difficult to understand. Need to look for more references in order to understand well.
1,Slow Order Process,I could not imagine that the process of processing my order is is slow. It took more than a week just only to process my order. I would consider of buying book again on this site!
1,A Rather Sorry Style,"I investigated this author when a friend told me he develops some interesting characters. But I can't comment on the story line, because the writing style in the two books I've perused is so inferior I couldn't stick with them long enough to develop an opinion. The short, choppy sentences and unimaginative vocabulary were very displeasureable, I've read better from freshman lit students. Maybe the author's style had a purpose, but if it did I missed it and I have no desire to try his books again."
4,Rare look at a man we once feared,"When Comrade Nikita was ousted from being the head of the USSR, he did not just quietly ""fade away."" He lived many more yeas, and dictated his thoughts and memoirs for future generations to understand what he had experienced. In this, the last of the three books of his memoirs, he opens up on several subjects which were too politically sensitive before Gorbachev's time to publish.The events of the Cuban Missile Crisis, and other events that were tinged with controversy make their way to publication here, and therefore offers a great chance to get some idea of Khrushchev's opinion and motivations in some major issues."
2,I almost gave it three. . .,"This is a book that contains three adaptations from Star Trek: The Animated Series.These adaptations are from the episodes ""Once Upon a Planet"", ""Mudd's Passion"" and ""The Magics of Megas-Tu"".The first two episodes are relatively good and I give them both three stars.""The Magics of Megas-Tu"", however isn't nearly as succesfull.It has many elements in it that are simply absurd.Take the journey to the galaxy's core for instance. The time to get there with maximum warp would be measured in decades.This was, if I recall correctly, the very same error that made Gene Roddenberry declare the fifth movie non-canon. The physics sound absurd after a nano-second of consideration. And it doesn't help one bit that the rest of the episode is at least as childishly groundet. Wach the series, but don't read the book."
2,Not Like The Photo,"This shelf arrived today and I was pretty disappointed... from the photo on the page it looks not only like there were two shelves included, but the area of the shelf looks much more substantial. This could maybe hold a thin picture frame or something but nothing any wider than an inch and a half basically. Not a great purchase."
1,Crap,"When buying the shelves or rather shelf I thought there would be two becasue the photo shows two, but there was only one. Also the shelf was so thin. You could maybe put a very thin picture frame or something but really nothing else. Don't buy. It might look like a steal getting 2 for that price but when you see the quality of the product it's way overpriced and a HUGE waste of money!!!"
3,Very introductory,"I read this book in a parking lot waiting for my son to get out of college. It is a decent introductory book to using playing cards for divination but if you're looking for a ""hold my hand and guide me every step of the way"" style book in this you're not going to get it. It gives a brief overview of the system and then the majority of the book is ""If you are doing a 7 card spread then..."" and it gives an example spread and reading. Good for those who learn by example, I suppose."
5,A delghtful fantasy for children,"L. Frank Baum (1856-1919) became very famous a loved for his later books on Dorthy and Oz. This book written in 1903, and still delightful today, contains fourteen tales. Baum warns his readers that the stories are not true, ""they could not be true and be so marvelous. No one is expected to believe them; they were meant to excite laughter and to gladden the heart.""The monarch of Mo is a king of average size who is ""delightfully jolly when he is not sad, and seldom sad if he can possibly be jolly."" He does not deal in magic, but ""he leads such a queer life in such a queer country that his history will surely seem magical to us who inhabit civilized places."" Why is there no map of the land of Mo? Because the map-makers did not know about the land, but the readers who read Baum's book will learn what they do not know, and will enjoy doing so."
2,"Wonderful book, terrible edition","First off, let me say that I love the stories in this book; I read it for the first time many years ago. However, I just ordered this edition (Dodo Press), and the printing is terrible. The illustrations look like they are 3rd or 4th generation: very blurry. I appreciate that Dodo is trying to make books available that would not otherwise be available, but it really looks no better than if I typed the book, copied the PDF files of the illustrations, and slapped a cover on it. I returned my copy and bought the Dover edition (which was also cheaper)."
5,Reggae Rap @ KHJC Romero,"Yaga Yaga, Reggae fans here are some great Jams to take to a party.Example Bismark N.D.house party not knowing anyone loved reggae tunes when having a few. I was feelin pretty IRIE so I went out side to the car to get Terror Fabulous, I took the CD inside to see if they would jam it for me and I said maby you guys might like it. Guss what? they loved it they played it all night till I left they wanted me to stay longer cause I had the jams. I'm really glad I bought this album. So if you don't have this I would recomend it, just think of all the parties you'll go to or have. I do give this 5 stars. Still Jammin @ khjc."
1,I do not know what Sony was thinking...,"I bought mine at CC, and am returning it tomorrow. It only works with half of the DVDs I have tried in it. With the other half (which, by the way, work in a regular Sony DVD and in a Sony Vaio computer), the images froze every other minute, the rewind feature did not work, the scene selection neither, etc. The DVDs I have tried in it are, in many instances new, but still do not work (i.e., Seinfeld, Indiana Jones). When it works, the image is very good, and the sound also, but the infuriating habit of not playing 50% of the DVDs is more that I can stand."
1,Just stopped working,"I have had the player for approximately one year and hardly ever used it. I have played about 10 DVD's on it and when I got it out to use it the other day I started watching a movie and the screen all of a sudden froze. I tried to push fast forward, pause, and play and the player did nothing. I turned it off and back on and now all I get is No Disc or Disc Error on the screen. I believe the player should have been capable of playing at least a thousand DVD's before a failure. I kept the player in a case in my closet so it wasn't setting out in direct sunlight or anything. I am very disappointed in this product and have written Sony about it. I will have to wait and see how well they back the products they sell."
1,A piece of JUNK!!!!,"I purchased this item a few months ago, it is now a very expensive paper weight. It doesn't read any DVDs I have and getting it repaired is not even an option. I'm not surprised to see that others have had a similar history with this product. I'm surprised AMAZON has not pulled this product from their offerings."
1,Pile of Garbage,"I've had this unit 10 months. Firstly, you can't use it without a battery, even if its connected the mains. What a joke. So my first battery wouldn't recharge, and Sony charged me $258 for a new battery. Half what I paid for the whole DVD.That battery lasts 5 hours, and the system turns off. It won't recharge either. So today, they tell me my power adapter needs exchanging, and thats $158. I tell them to shove it, I'm never buying another piece of junk from this company ever again. I read they are struggling to prevent from going bankrupt. With this terrible service, I'll be happy if they never sell anything to anyone ever again."
5,Great Player,I'm not sure what all the bad reviews are for this unit has lasted me for years and that's with an 11 year old playing it to death. I really do get tired of Sony haters filling up all the reviews with bad data.
2,chili dipper,I read the book in one sitting but can't figure out why. There are too many unanswered questions. Great charactors that don't go anywhere. Nice writing style that doesn't really say anything.Golf lends itself well to fiction but this book doesn't finish what it starts.
3,"""Paging"" Jean Van de Velde","The first 252 pages of his novel were as good as the first 71 holes of Van de Velde's 1999 British Open. Sadly, Van de Velde finished stronger."
3,Enjoyable...if you approach it with reasonable expectations,"This book excels in several respects. While the title's reference to ""Gentleman's Game"" suggests the stereotypical picture of golf, the book is anything but that. It develops a diverse cast of characters and an unpredictable plot. Each time I thought that I knew what would happen next...the author was at least one step ahead of me. I loved both the dialogue and the visual images. The main weaknesses are the slow pace and the author's failure to bring together the sub-plots in an entirely satisfying way. Overall, if you approach this book with reasonable expectations, you will likely enjoy it...whether or not your are a golfer."
4,HOLE IN ONE!!,"Tom Coyne got it right his first time out! He grabbed my attention in the first line and held it through his surprising conclusion. I actually lost sleep the first night reading, as I rounded the turn, and lay awake wondering what would unfold on the back nine.In ""A Gentleman's Game"", Coyne vividly sets an affluent Country Club as the backdrop for a cast of diverse characters. He takes you into the world of Golf in a way you've never seen it before, crossing social barriers and commenting on the struggles of each class. He uses a likeable, 13 year old, golf prodigy to delve into the lives of characters we all know and characters we've never met. Using dialogue that is real and to the point, Coyne makes you feel like you are involved in the conversation. Words are never wasted. He makes you laugh, cry, and think!""A Gentleman's Game"" is entertaining, disturbing, sensitive, and soothing. It's a must read for Golfers and non-golfers alike!"
4,cool record,"I have seen this guy's records for a while. I thought he was kind of like John Vanderslice. This is a young English guy, who is 21 years old, and has released two records. He seems to have a lot of classical training. Everyone was to be a pop star nowadays. The music is really excellent. It sounds really distinguished. It's somewhere between The Divine Comedy and Momus. Yes it sounds decadent. It sounds arty. The first single ""The Libertine"" sounds literary and gives me that impression. Patrick Wolf combines folk music, rock, electronic and classical. Apparently Meredith Monk inspired him too. He's played with Hidden Cameras. This guy is the real thing. It's something to check out. It has real feeling to it. I want to see him play live soon. I love this song called ""Railway Song."" Patrick Wolf is worthy."
5,Wind in the Wires,Great album from Patrick Wolf. His maturity from Lycanthropy is very evident in his stylings from his voyages to his roots in Cornwall and Ireland.
3,Not Professional Quality,"I'm glad I bought 2 because the 1st one broke half way through the season. I have a lawn care business and spray weeds for about 50 residential properties. It comes with different tips which is nice, but the trigger broke in July. The plastic rocker point just pulled apart. When the next one goes I will replace it with one from Shindiawa for about $45.00."
3,"great insight into Montessori's mind, not a how to book","This book is great for explaining the very basics of the montessori manipulatives and their primary function. it's good for background and knowledge into Montessori's methods and thinking (for primary aged children). It is NOT, however, a how to or instruction guide for Montessori. you won't gleen much about how to use things (other than one or maybe two basic functions) from this book. for that you need montessori albums, which will cost you a considerable amount of money.i think this book is useful to people wanting to know more about Montessori and how she came up with the manips themselves or saw the children react to them but if you're trying to emulate the montessori method in your home and need more information, your money would be better spent elsewhere. for that i would recommend: Teaching Montessori in the Home by Elizabeth Hainstock."
3,Montesori for insiders,"I have purchased this book to get as close as possible to Dr Montessori's thoughts and get a big picture of what Montessori really is - straight from the author. This book is great at that, but I was very disappointed to find that the thin brochure has very poor layout - like a printed word document bound into paperback. And no figures are included at all, although they are mentioned in text. A list of Montessori tools is also useless without figures and illustrations, because one can not visualise what the text is describing. So, all in all, this does not help a parent in actually working the Montessori way - this is more or less just a chain of thoughts that are behind the method. For a practical demonstration some other book must be selected."
1,Drink Holder Material at best,"I had low expectations when buying this product, and this package failed to meet them. There are at least 3 different setup programs, none consistent, 2 of which are based on an old Windows 3.1 setup program, with 8.3 character expectations. After installing, 2 programs wouldn't run - ""couldn't find file xxxxxxxx.xxx"", so I don't actually know how these 2 run. The main 3d program launched, but is about useless. Your time is worth more than this."
1,This is a terrible product,"... I wanted to use the Landscape Design 3D to make a plot of my yard. The first thing I did was try to add a fence, and it didn't work. I could add a fence segment all right, but then the program was stuck in ""add fence"" mode and no combination of mouse clicks or key presses seemed to get me out of it. I had to go into Task Manager and ""end task"" to get out of it.Next, I tried adding a path. That worked OK, but the 3D view of it had some cropping issues such that the path appeared to be shaped like a semicircle instead of an arc.None of the other products were much better, and yes, the install process was flawed for me too.Don't buy this."
1,Pass this one by,"Well, this certainly was a waste of time and money. With dull prose, unoriginal ideas, and a complete lack of revelatory finds, this book seems created to take up space on a shelf without actually adding to anything (except perhaps the author's resume). Don't even both with it."
4,Are We There Yet? Starring Miles the Goose,"Very cute, very entertaining. It kept the interest of our kids ages 3, 6, 10 and 12."
4,Ice Cube the Babysitter,"Ice Cube sees Nia Long and falls in love almost at first sight. He will do just about anything to get at her. Even transporting her 2 kids across country. This is where the fun begins. What an adventure the ride turn out to be.This was a different type of role for Ice Cube. Taking on the challenge of working with kids was a bold move. Not sure if he'll do it again anytime soon. There were plenty of laughs in the movie. However, overall, the movie didn't do too well at the box office.Worth a rental to see one time only. Or see it on cable.Not terrible, but not great either."
1,Worst Movie Ever,"This is a movie with no plot or story. It is boring and impossible to watch without sleeping. Ice Cube acts like a child in this horrible movie. It is mainly about kids being horrible to Ice Cube when he is just trying to get them to their mother.The kids act like brats, if they were kind in the movie then it might have a chance of being rated 1 and a half stars.By, Victoria"
5,Are We There Yet?,"Nick, a smooth operator, is trying to land a date with a young, attractive divorcee, Suzanne. Problem is Suzanne is stuck working in Vancouver and miserable because she misses her kids. Seizing the opportunity, Nick gallantly offers to make her wish come true--and his own in the process--by bringing seven-year-old Kevin and eleven-year-old Lindsey up from Portland, Oregon to be reunited with their mom. What Nick doesn(tm)t know is that Suzanne's children think that no man is good enough for their mom and will do everything they can to make the trip a nightmare for him. Fasten your seat belts, it's going to be a bumpy ride. No special effects, just plain ole' fashion acting, it's worth seeing."
1,Is it finished yet?,"This film was right down there with the worst movies I have ever had the misfortune to view. My constant reaction to each additional assault on my entertainment receptors was ""is it finished yet?"" (please!!!). If my kids had enjoyed I could easy forgive this as I am obviously not the target audience, but they didn't wait for the finish (chores were more interesting)."
4,GOOD FUNNY FAMILY MOVIE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"THIS IS A GREAT FAMILY MOVIE TO WATCH. MY 4 YEAR OLD DAUGHTER IS ON LOVE WITH THIS MOVIE. THE MOVIE IS ABOUT ICE CUDE, WHO IS A SINGLE MAN WHO TRIES TO GET WITH NIA LONG, WHO IS SINGLE MOTHER IF TWO BAD KIDS! THE TWO KIDS TAKE ICE CUDE ON A LONG RIDE AS HE TRIED TO IMPRESS NIA LONG. HE TRIES REALLY HARD TOO. BUT THAT JUST MAY NOT BE ENOUGH TO IMPRESS NIA. YOU HAVE TO WATCH THE MOVIE TO SEE IF THEY END U 2GETHER OR NOT. BUT THE MOVIE IS GOOD. CHECK IT OUT!"
4,Worked for us,The kids were skeptical at first but the movie pulled them in and they enjoyed it. Every now and then they would be yelling out answers or something.
3,In the end it's cute,"At first I was appalled by this movie. The kids are complete brats, and the humor is like that of Home Alone (which was funny 15 years ago, but is old now) By the end of the movie, the heart is shown, and it's actually pretty cute. I just wish it got to the end quicker."
2,So bad I didn't finish it,"Ice Cube is right on as an actor. I thought he was just another tough guy wanna be as he started off in music (and let's face it, for rap music all you have to do is rhyme and get a producer with a good dance beat plus a video and you've got it made), but I see his real talents are in his acting. He actually has a flare for being the underdog, the everyman who you root for even when he gets kicked around.This movie, however, didn't make the most of his talents. The story had potential for a madcap adventure. The kids, unfortunately, were the biggest problem. They were just plain annoying. They were mean, calculating, and weren't even cute enough to make anyone in the audience go ""Awww, aren't they cute?"". If I were him, I'd say forget it and dump them at the next toll booth."
4,"It's a kids' fantasy, it's supposed to be exaggerated...","Just wanted to let other parents out there know that someone likes this movie. I understand others' compaints: especially, Ice Cube saying d*** a few times. But if you can overlook that and you don't insist on a realistic portrayal of how kids act then you might enjoy this. I laughed quite a bit, and I see a lot of family movies that put me to sleep. This movie is rather like Planes, Trains and Automobiles for kids. It also has a Home Alone/kids-versus-the-world feel to it. I don't think kids will take this literally. It's just fun. And in the end Ice Cube learns the importance of family and wins the kids' respect so that they are able to let their guard down and feel safe for once."
1,pure stuipedness.,This movie is A waste of time. An hour and Ahalf of my lifewasted.This movie is about A guy (Ice Cube)who's A player and likes this girlbut her bratty snotty kids have A problemwith that so they try to practicly runhim over.If you like this movieI reccomend snow dogs.
1,terrible service for amazon purchase,"After trying 2 times to order this DVD, they could not get it right. Although I did get my money back, I had to go through the hassle of returning it and they still didn't correct the order. I would have to go back to the start and re-order hoping they can read. Terrible experience!!!!!"
2,Not What I Expected,"We saw the move, ""Are We There Yet?"" in the theater and really enjoyed it, so we decided to purchase this DVD. It would be a good movie for kids if not for the swearing and bad attitudes of the children in the movie. We probabbly will not watch the DVD again (at least not with kids)."
4,I liked this movie!,"This is a pretty good film where two kids wreck havoc on their mothers new boyfriend!I only gave it four stars cause it does lack something,even though I don`t know what!You`re sure to atleast like it a little,though!It does have lots of big laughes!You may want to rent this movie before you spend your money on,just to make sure you like it enough!Thanks for reading my review~God Bless U All!!!!"
1,Horrible!!!!!,"it might sound crazy,but I truly beleive that Jerri curl era Ice cube could have pulled off this ""Be Be's Kids"" attempted at fim making.How Cube gets over with these films sometimes I have no idea.Nia Long was looking good as usual.but she is wasted in this tacky turkey of a film.I give ice cube Pimp props for rolling the safe accessible films,because Bro Man ain't slowing down on His Hollywood roll,but this was so cliched it wasn't even funny. heck the first scenes jacked Home alone.I give Cube Parlay Props from rolling the Music Hustle&now the Movie Hustle,but in terms of Quality He is dropping skunks."
3,Cute - but ... :-(,"This movie wasn't too bad. It had a good story line and was acted well, but at many times, it crossed the border from silly funny, to just plain stupid. While this obviously isn't a movie for Oscar consideration, I couldn't get passed the bratty, rude and undisiplined kids. They needed a good smack on their rears. Ice Cube is good. He's great whether he's in a comedy or drama and let me just say that he gets finer with each passing movie. Watch this and you'll have a laugh I guarantee, but if you can get past the annoying kids, you'll more than laugh, you'll enjoy it. Jay Mohr has a good role in this too."
4,Worth Watching,We watched this movie as a family and really had fun. It was well thought out and pulled at your heart strings making you hope right along with the kids that they would all end up together and they did!
3,lacked something,like depth! The story line was great. A single guy doing a favor for a female he wants to get to know better. The favor turns out to be more than he bargined for. This is not a family movie. Too bad!
4,"A somewhat a clean, fun comedy -- more like 3 1/2 stars","I thought this was a funny movie to some degree. At least there isn't any bad language in it and for a change it's fun to see a new Lincoln Navigator get abused.Sure, the plot isn't that special and the whole movie is a little flat to say the least, but I can say that the kids like the movie and have watched it already a few times over the last few days -- so it may become a babysitter standard -- we'll see.I would give this movie more like 3 1/2 stars if even that many, but overall the 4 stars are more a rating from my kids and the neighborhood kids who really liked this flick."
5,The best movies of this year,My children loved it.My husband and I love it. I think it a very good family movie. I think that some single man might just under stand what a father is. And maybe they'll think twice before date a women with kids. It was a heart warming movies. And maybe this movie would give us a open mind on life and the feelings of other.And maybe this way they won't be so many fatherless children out there.my husband even changes a little with our kids.I think it because what he saw in this heart warming movie. It might not as funny as you think but it haves values.and there is a message in the movie . Just watch the kids
3,For certain ages probably,"The kids behavior makes you think what a sad state of affairs parenting has become in this age of having to work, single parenting, etc. If you can get past the snotty behavior the children have and lack of respect they have for anything that doesn't benefit them well, good. The film tries to soften it by explaining their father has been absent and thus this excuses their actions, well I don't know. For me it was an uneasy way to view a movie."
5,great movie,Saw part of it at my mother in laws. I had to buy it so I could see the whole thing it is a very funny entertaining movie.
5,Are we there yet?,My daughter watch this movie everyday sometimes 3/4 times a day. . . Thx. . . . We love it. . . No scratches lik new
5,Absolutely hilarious! Highly recommended.,"This movie is great! I wasn't quite sure what to expect, but this went well beyond my expectations in terms of hilarity. Yes, a few of the scenes are over done and unrealistic, but they just add to the humor. It is also quite humorous to see a brand new, customized Lincoln get turned into a something not even worthy of a junkyard. Some of the other scenes are romantic ""nonsense"", but it doesn't detract from the movie much at all.I would definitely recommend that you see this movie at least once, and if possible, multiple times. It is well worth your time. Buying this movie would also be a great idea."
1,I wish they'd gotten there faster...,"...so the movie'd end faster.Okay, Ice Cube can't act for his life. Neither can kids. And the screenwriters think video games are rated ""G"". Don't even get me started on the bobblehead."
1,One of the worst movies ever,"First of all those kids were just so annoying. Ice Cube should have left them on the side of the road for a wolf pack. Did they really have to fill up another 5 minutes of time by letting that girl sing 'Respect'? I've heard American Idol rejects on crack who sing better than that. The little boy was uglier and even more annoying than the kid on Bernie Mac, and that's really saying something. This movie made me nautious. It has little entertainment value, is absolutly unbelievable (even for a comedy), and the acting is so dry and wooden, I was surprised nothing caught fire. Awful awful movie. Dig my eyes out with a plastic fork from Wendy's before subjecting me to this again."
3,SOMEWHAT BUMPY RIDE,"While this movie has some funny moments, the problem with ARE WE THERE YET is that the kids are soooo bad, I never ended up liking them, even after their semi-metamorphosis. Having been the product of a broken home, my parent's divorce did nothing quite so drastic to our homelife. The kids are out and out mean, and this makes me thing Nia Long's mother didn't have the parenting skills to deal with being a single mom either. I found nothing ""cute"" about their behavior and don't really understand how Ice Cube put up with them as well as he did.Touting this as a ""family"" movie is truly hypocritical, as it does nothing but give kids the go ahead to do mean and hateful things and then just laugh them off. Ice even manages to lose his very expensive Navigator and still wants to be a papa to the brats. I can't totally trash the movie, but I would not recommend it for any young children as it is certainly not the kind of movie I would want my little ones to see."
4,very good,This CD features 2 sides of reggaeton. the regular reggaeton and spanish rap. In my perspective I like the Spanish rap better. It has very cool beats and melodies.
5,An all-nighter,"Sunrise by Miranda Jarrett is a beautiful, stay-up-all-night- magic historical which set on Nantucket in the early 18th century. The love between the heroine, Juliette, who was washed up on the beach and rescued by the hero, Daniel Fairbourne, is exquisitely tender and beautiful. Their lives and growing passion are complicated by rumors of French smuggling, Juliette, unaware of who she is and where she came from, and suspicious townspeople who are ready to judge and condemn. Though Juliette and Daniel struggle to learn about who they are, in the process, they also learn about who and why they love. This book is simply wonderful.Orysia Earhart, President, Valley Forge Romance Writers."
3,Great Man and for the most part ... great music,"Ismael Miranda who sings ""Roberto"" and Andy Montanez who interprets ""Roberto y Tirabala"" still sound as good as ever, and for the most part, the album holds up well. Although, the track ""Jugando La Pelota"" sounds like it was haphazardly pieced together, and I found it strange that the ballad, ""Lo Mejor Que Dios Ha Hecho"" makes no real reference to Roberto Clemente. This track, although quite lovely, sounds as if it was a last minute ""throw-in"" on the album. Overall though, the love and respect for this great Latin Sports Figure shines through on the project. Pay particular attention to ""Somos La Fuerza Latina"" which highlights the contributions of all Spanish countries to the great sport of baseball."
4,"Gentle, Melodic Celtic Harp","Myrdhin is a Breton harpist in the tradition of Alan Stivell. He mixes traditional Celtic melodies with modern arrangements and instrumentation. This CD contains music that he recorded back in the early 80's (and a few tunes from the late 70s). Mostly, it's just Myrdhin playing steel-strung harp and singing, backed by a bit of percussion, flute, and a few other instruments from the two other musicians who make up the ""An Delen Dir"" trio. Very pretty, very melodic, and quite folksy. I'm reminded a bit of Stivell's ""Journee a la Maison"". If you liked that (or other mellow stuff by Stivell), you'll probably like this."
2,Not for the average reader,"This is a book you cannot read like a novel; even as a diary, it is hard to understand, because entries are short and there are many unintelligible initials and half-words. It is a book for scholars, not for the average reader."
2,Not for me,"This is, simply put, too salty. Even if used sparingly there's no heat to it, just saltiness. I won't be buying this again."
1,Not correct format,I was so excited to get this movie for my students. I had even completed a mini lesson on the topic. The students were also looking forward to it. Unfortunately when I received it. I noticed that it said that it was a European DVD. I do not understand why amazon would allow this to be sold to US customers without this being clearly communicated before my purchase. I am extremely disappointed. I have resolved to purchase my DVDs from Best Buy from now on to ensure that I get the correct formatting.
2,A lot of hype,"Somewhere I had read how great this movie was. I was pretty dissapointed! Definately not a high budget film, or even close! I would pay about 5 bucks for the movie, but nothing more!"
5,CAUTION! - This movie will scare the HELL out of you,This is not a documentary. It is a very realistic feeling movie walking you through the expected catalclismic events leading up to and following the eruption of the super volcano under Yellowstone National Park.I don't believe this movie will ever be telecast because it would cause such a panic. It was disturbing to watch because it was so realistically portrayed. It is a very exciting and dramatic story that may likely affect the world as we know it.
4,VERY pink,"I got this case because it would hold my Treo well, and I wouldn't have to remove the phone to use it. Fits well, does the trick, but the pink is a bit much for me. I mostly purhased it because it was one of the only Treo cases I could find that had a wrist strap - I'm a lady who wears dresses every once in a while, so a belt clip just doesn't work for me (plus I don't want a bluky phone on my hip, especially when I need to carry my baby). It would be nice if the manufacturers would realize that."
4,The problem is the mix,"This IS Lennon's craftmanship album, no doubt. And the songs themselves are highly listenable; however, the production is not. The Mind Games songs on Anthology, like the Rock n Roll songs on Anthology, when stripped of the ""wall of sound"" that was added in post-production, shine like rough diamonds. Unfortunately, on this album, Lennon shows an inability to produce his own work. If this album were totally remixed, it would astound. Out the Blue, Intuition, Mind Games, You are Here, I Know, and even Tight A$, are great songs; they're just buried in a muddy mix."
3,A mixed bag,"I'm looking at some of these lyrics here, and for the most part I'm not all that impressed. Which is sad, because John's supposed to be good at writing lyrics. You wouldn't know by listening to songs like ""Tight A$"", ""Aisumasen (I'm Sorry)"", ""Intuition"", or ""Meat City"", though. Musically, there are also a couple bad ideas (an enormous choir on ""One Day (At a Time)"", pedal steel on ""You Are Here""). So the best songs are the good ol' fashioned revolutionary ones: ""Bring on the Lucie (Freeda People)"", the wonderful title song; ""Only People"". And a couple of the above poorly-written songs have some merit: ""Intuition"" has a bouncy melody and interesting keyboards; ""Tight A$"", a slide guitar. And I do like the gentle, sensitive ""Out of the Blue"" and the almost Macca-like ""I Know (I Know)"". This is no better than Plastic Ono Band or even Imagine and Double Fantasy- it is a jumble of an album, after all. Just a moderately enjoyable one."
5,The scales fell from my ears,"I was always frustrated with Mind Games in the past, cuz it was such a muddy mix. Well, no more. With the remaster, everything is nice and clear, and I begin to hear instruments I never even knew were there. More importantly, the performances suddenly seem to have much more spirit and energy. I used to think it was a so-so album, but now I get all happy and excited when listening to it.Just to not seem like a one-sided cheerleader, this has way seventies production, which is groovily retro in general. But he has some backup vocals that I wish would go away. That's my only real complaint about the music. I would add that I'm a little skeptical about their claim that it was remixed. Remastered, for sure, but I think it may still be the original mix.Either way, it's a vast improvement, and a worthy addition to your collection."
5,Great Lennon album....,"John was on a roll with this, Imagine and the release after this oneWalls and Bridges. A lot of great Lennon writing on this album."
5,CRANK IT UP!,"Wow, what a great sounding and FUN album!Meat City almost knocked me off my sofa! After hundreds of listenings, I'm hearing tons of new harmonies, keyboard accents, great bass notes and crisp and clean sound altogether. Alright, this has always been a favorite John album of mine. I bought it new and grew to love it. This remastered version put the Plastic Ono Band IN my living room.Out The Blue, sung with great gusto and feeling, is an unknown classic, give it a listen. John's attitude is relaxed and seemingly content, especially in Freeda People (Bring on The Lucy).I know (I know) has great vocals displaying Lennon's 50s infulence.You Are Here featues great harmonies and keyboard by Ken Ascher...I thought it was Nicky Hopkins playing.Back to Meat City....what a lost A-side, in my opinion. Fun lyrics and a sizzling lead guitar. I'll always love this record..uhhh CD. God, I miss John Lennon...it really was the end of the innocence in life for me.."
3,Lennon Picks Up the Pieces,"Recovering from the critical and commercial failure of ""Some Time in New York City,"" John Lennon tries to recapture the ""Imagine"" spirit with this pleasant, inoffensive album. ""Mind Games"" (1973) benefits from its reggae-tinged title song, the underrated ballad ""Out of the Blue"" and punchy rockers such as ""Tight A$"" and ""Meat City."" Too bad the remaining tracks are undistinguished by Lennon standards. ""Bring on the Lucie (Freeda People)"" is a sloppy rehash of ""Power to the People"" - while ""Only People"" sounds like the lightweight commercial jingle it eventually became. Though uneven, ""Mind Games"" would prove a step in the right direction, as evidenced by John's harder-edged ""Walls and Bridges"" (1974)."
4,Almost Great!,"From the downright weird cover, to the unusual collection of songs, one gets the feeling that if Lennon would only have spent a bit more time and effort on this album that it would have been spectacular.""Intuition"" & ""One Day at a Time"" have aged well.If only he had tried a little harder............But well worth a few listens, much about this was good. The use of subtle harmony, and razor sharp wit, is typically Lennonesque."
2,I'm Sorry,"After the resounding flop of ""Some Time in New York City,"" one of the most hated and reviled albums of the rock era, John Lennon beat a hasty retreat with ""Mind Games."" On this record, gone are ""Some Time's"" naive agitprop lyrics and radical left cliches; gone is any trace of Yoko Ono as co-writer or duet partner (?!!); and also gone, sadly, are the great musicianship and exhilirating production. This is the worst set of songs Lennon ever recorded -- one limp, whining apology to Yoko after another. And the production, as my friend Sean MacFalls used to say, sounds like glue. If you're getting into solo Lennon, then stick with ""Plastic Ono Band,"" ""Imagine,"" and yes, even the notorious ""Some Time in NYC."""
4,Cult hits,"I would recommend MIND GAMES as much as I would any John Lennon album. Lennon's IMAGINE, DOUBLE FANTASY and WALLS AND BRIDGES contain most of his smash hits. But MIND GAMES has what I call John's cult hits, radio-ignored songs that people mention as favorites when I tell them I'm a Lennon fan: ""Meat City,"" ""One Day At A Time,"" ""Tight A$,"" and ""Bring On The Lucie."" Try it, you'll like it."
5,"Sometimes, its GOOD to play MIND GAMES :)","MoFi has updated yet another classic! Shawn Britton's mastering is as always - dead on, never betraying the initial vibe and intention of the ORIGINAL MASTER RECORDING, but delicously accentuating what is already there to maximum sonic fruition..."
4,"""Mind Games"" not quite complete","Like the other Lennon remasters, the sound is greatly improved. The disappointing factor is the abbreviated fade-out on ""Meat City"". During the fade on the vinyl LP, Lennon says ""Who is that? Who is that? Who is that? Who ... is ... that? And why are they doing ... those ... strange ...... things?"" When the original CD was issued years ago, the last word (""things"") was missing. Now this remastered edition omits the entire last question. I guess another ""improved"" version will arrive in a few years and I can buy this album again."
2,"2 1/2 stars, actually-- this one is far from essential","the title track is good, ""out the blue"" is good as well. but overall, this is a poorly produced album (it sounds cluttered and messy) of mediocre filler material from one of popular music's greatest. Lennon's singing isn't even particularly engaging on this one."
2,"It,s not great","Probably the worst vocal wise i ever heard by Lennon Maccartny and harrison just helped him better. Don,t get me wrong Lennons voice and gutar playing is great I think here though he just did not care. GodBless"
3,I'm a big Lennon fan. Anthology selections are better!!,"I was slightly disappointed with ONE DAY AT A TIME. The first time I ever heard it was on The Lennon Anthology. The anthology version is by far better, just him, his real voice, no layering effects, more mellow. I don't get Nutopian National Anthem, I don't know why!!! Is it because it's 3 seconds of blank space??? Other songs are great, though!!"
4,Amazing...,"Lennon creates a masterpiece without knowing it on this album. At first it seems overwhelming to most, but after repeated listenings it gets better and better.The Title track is eaisly the best song on the album. ""Meat City"" goes for second. ""Out of the Blue"" and ""Intuition"" are also great.The CD insert is also intresting. The drawings by Lennon are very entertaining.This Album falls short of 5 Stars because of the lack of worthwhile bonus tracks. The bonus tracks here are home versions of three of the songs and aren't worth the listen.An excellent album by a very talented musicain. Requried listening for all rock fans."
2,Sub-par album from one of rock's greats,"Mind Games is far from Lennon's best. Plastic Ono Band and Imagine tower above Mind Games like the Empire State Building. By 1973, Lennon, like much of his generation, was burning out, and Beatles fans know he was not in the best frame of mind at this point. The title track is good but it sounds like the little brother of ""Imagine,"" one of Lennon's best songs. Another song, ""You are here"" is an undiscovered gem, but the album as a whole is poorly-produced and the rockers sound tired. Buy this CD if you can find it used for a few bucks."
4,"The best song on this album is Born To Be a Cowboy, song #3","The best song on this album is song #3, Born To Be a Cowboy! (but, it's not on your song list) It was written by a true working cowboy and fellow NM singing buddy of Michael's, R.W. Hampton. It's great traveling music, dance music, and it sums up how most of us cowboys feel when we think of all those good memories. Michael has come along way from his rock and folk roots, it seems he understands a cowboy's heart."
1,please do not buy this book,"when i published this edition in 1997, it was useful for musicians trying to get their music played on radio. but the book is mostly a directory of contact information for radio stations, and a lot of this information has changed in the past five years. so be forewarned that most of the book's contents are out of date. thanks and best of luck. - gary hustwit."
2,An O.K. primer,"This book can give you some idea of how to go about getting airplay, but it is not the alpha and the omega on the subject.The interviews with music directors/DJ's/etc. give some insight into the ""radio mind"", and are interesting in that one often contradicts the next (!). The directory of US/Canadian radio stations has some useful information (frequency and wattage), but I found the address/phone/contact info to be incorrect more often than not.One can only hope that an author ""in the know"" will write a better book with more useful information for the self-release market."
1,bad ink catridges,I will never buy this item again. The first catridge ruined my Canon printer and I had to discard the rest of them.
4,Ultimate Travel Comfort!,"This product is great! Easy to inflate/deflate. Small and compact to take anywhere. Gives great support and comfort for the head and neck while traveling long distances. Made for a great convo piece because every time I used it, no one else had even thought of bringing one! The last time I used it was a long car ride to the beach. I may have forgotten other ""beach essentials"" like a towel, but I had my travel pillow. It's great!! THANX"
2,Great shape but doesnt stay inflated --> Sore neck,"I bought this for long flights. Really good shape to support your neck but leaked air on me after a couple uses. The finish on this is comfortable, and I liked the clasp on the front that holds two two sides together. This is probably the closest thing I could find to a neck brace, but when I try to sleep on an overnight flight in anything other than a lay flat bed in first class, thats exactly what I am looking for."
3,decent for the price,"Good pillow, but the button attachment is terrrrrrible. Just snaps off every few seconds, so it feels like the pillow would slip off your neck anytime! I need to figure out if I can attach a velcro closure (....without puncturing the pillow itself..arrrgh)"
1,Do NOT BUY IT!,This item is very uncomfortable and it smells like china right out the box. I would suggest just a regular stuffed neck pillow. Do not get one that is inflatable they just suck.
1,Not impressed,"I couldn't figure out how to get the thing to inflate. Maybe I'm a moron but the instructions were definitely vague. A small round piece of paper surrounding the value saying ""Pinch the valve to inflate"" seems a little inadequate. Yes I didn't have the time to call you and argue - I wish the product had worked easier. It's just lying around in the same condition - never used."
4,This item just puts me to sleep,I blew up this pillow while it was around my neck and said: Thiissss issn't verrrry comforrtablle. Then I let out a little air. Then I fell asleep for about 4 or 5 hours. Then I landed. Perfect
1,A complete waste of money,"I purchased two of these at one go. However I was not able to use either of them EVEN ONCE, because BOTH the pillows sprang leaks the VERY FIRST time I filled them with air. Don't waste your money like I did."
2,Obus Forme Inflatable Travel Pillow,"It is compact and easy enough to use. However, I have a long neck and it just does not provide the support I had hoped for."
2,Uncomfortable,"The seams leave grooves in your face and neck and the snap only works for people with extremely small necks. I have a 16 neck, which is within normal range and it chokes me if I try to snap it closed. Try another travel pillow."
1,"Poor quality, very disappointed","We bought two of these for an international trip and one had a tear in it right out of the box, so could never inflate it. While the other one stayed inflated, the fabric is scratchy, so it was very uncomfortable to use."
1,will not hold air after 1 use.,I guess these are meant to be disposable because it will not stay inflated after using it on a single flight- could not even use it roundtrip...
4,Not a permanent solution,"Mine worked wonderfully for the 24+ hour trip I took to get to China, which involved two bus rides, three plane rides, then another bus ride. And I used it a couple of times while in the country, like when I took an overnight train from Beijing to Shanghai.But by the time I was getting ready to go home, the pillow was no longer holding its air- it has a slow leak that, within 15 minutes, would make the pillow go from firm to unacceptably squishy and unsupportive. I threw it out before my flight home and bought another pillow in the airport.Do I regret the purchase? Not at all, since I got a lot of comfortable use out of it. Just be warned that you shouldn't expect this to last long if you use it heavily."
1,Too Small For My Neck,"This product needs to snap around your neck to fit properly, like a collar. I am under the height/weight indicated in the product description but it is too tight. I wear a shirt with a collar size of 17 (XL). Amazon or manufacturer should indicate a max collar size rather than a height/weight limit.Another point - As others have noted there is a bit of a seam along the inside. If you wear a collarless shirt such as a T-shirt or many women's shirts this might be irritating. Don't think it would be too bad if wearing a shirt with a collar - as you could wrap it around the outside of a collar.This goes back to Amazon."
2,less confort,"I purchased two kinds of inflatable pillows. This one is less comfort and rough around the inner neck diammeter. the material made of this is not comfort enough. The edges around the neck scratch and rub hard on the skin, causing irritation. If it were not the rubber meterial around the neck, it would be more relaxing."
2,Sharp edges,"This would be an excellent inflatable pillow but I don't know what they were thinking by not doing something about the inside seam. It is unbearable, it is sharp and scratchy and uncomfortable - the pillow is only useful if you are wearing a collar that you can turn up so that there is something between this pillow and your neck."
1,Disappointed,"Unfortunately, 2 out of the 4 I bought leaked after one use. One was hasn't been used yet and the other worked just fine. 2 are in the trash!"
3,"Okay, nothing great...","I had high hopes for this thing since we were going on a long plane trip. I tried and tried to get comfortable with it but it was too bulky. My daughter refused to try it since it looks so dorky. On the way home I didn't even take it out; a folded airline pillow worked better. I will probably keep it and try it for a car or train trip, then it's off to the thrift store. I have to remark that it didn't leak air; it's just too chunky for me and the surface tries to be fleecy but doesn't quite make it. Maybe it will work better for someone else."
4,Well worth it,"I've gone through a few travel pillows--some inflatable, some foam, one with cereal filler--but they've all been inadequate in keeping my head off my shoulder, and therefore in sleeping comfortably in a cramped airplane seat, until this one, which is also among the most reasonably priced."
1,Hole in the seam,I recieved this pillow with a hole along one of the seams so that you can not blow it up. There is a little plastic strip that seams together the 3 additional air pockets and the seam is unnattached along that plastic strip. It seams like it could easily tear in more places as well. Thats too bad. I also noticed the the inside seam around your neck could be uncomfortable as other users said. I would never buy another pillow like this one. At least Amazon will let me return it at no cost.
4,NICE PILLOW,THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IS THAT I WOULD BUY THIS PILLOW AGAIN. THE PILLOW WORKS GOOD THE ONLY MINOR PROBLEM I HAVE HAD IS WITH THE AIR VALVE. THE VALVE IS A LITTLE DIFFICULT TO SQUEEZE TO GET AIR INTO THE PILLOW. THE REAL CHALLENGE IS WHEN YOU DEFLATE THE PILLOW AND TRY TO PUT IT IN THE BAG THAT COMES WITH THE PILLOW. WHEN YOU FIRST GET THE PILLOW IN THE BAG TAKE A GOOD LOOK AT THE BAG BECAUSE THAT'S THE LAST TIME IN WILL EVER LOOK THAT SMALL AND FLAT.
2,Obus Forme Inflatable Travel Pillow - two weeks in Spain,The Obus Forme Inflatable Pillow was not very comfortable on the plane or on the tour bus. It was awkward to manage and it's outer cover was not comfortable without an additional coverlet -ie: a towel or small blanket. It was easily inflated and easy to travel with when deflated.
2,Didn't work for me,"Tried this on a red-eye from west to east coast. It probably didn't help that I couldn't get sleepy enough. Very uncomfortable. Like another reviewers, this pillow seemed very tight, even when air was let out. Seams on inside didn't help at all - bad idea. I'll try something else next time, like a sleeping pill."
2,so-so,"We purchased 3 pillows for a flight overseas. Two of the pillows were fine but the 3rd pillow got a hole in it very quickly. So, overall I'm not that pleased with the pillows. I didn't really think it helped me feel more comfortable on the plane. On the return trip I didn't end up using mine, I just used the airline's pillow."
1,Poor quality,"My obus forme inflatable travel pillow will not stay inflated. I blow it up, close it, seal it, and it immediately deflates. I purchased this as a birthday present for my mother before a long overseas trip, so I am pretty disappointed she is not able to use it."
4,Great Deal for a long trip,"I was a little wary of getting this for such a cheap price, but it was worth it. I took it on an 8 hour flight to Hawaii. You may have to play with the amount of air pressure inside to make it comfortable. Everyone is taking about the seam - but it didn't bother me at all. I actually took some tape with me to tape over it if it bothered me but it was no problem. Its not as comfortable as other foam pillows, but the best part is you can squeeze the air out and it folds up nice and compact. Air loss wasn't a problem. I blew it up when we got to altitude and it worked fine. I noticed that it lost some air when we landed - but that is due to the increase of pressure at sea level."
4,"Excellent, but be sure to use it with another book","I have yet to find the perfect AP prep book for any subject, so I HIGHLY recommend buying this with the PRINCETON REVIEW book because:-Cliffs has some of the most comprehensive review, though it doesnt have good review questions, at least not for AP preparation (assuming that's your intent).-Princeton R. has the BEST review QUESTIONS, AND the best AP practice exams, they virtually mimic College Board's--right down to the FONT! (don't know about the margins, though, haha)-Cliffs has THE BEST feature: timelines after every chapter to help with organization of the material covered.-Princeton does a pretty good job of covering key points for the DBQ and essay, but the key to nailing them is basically organization, a STRONG thesis, and a good knowledge of the content (which needs to be conveyed to the AP grader). That being said, these two books with definitely boost your knowledge and confidence when taking the AP exam. Peace, and good luck."
4,Should not be totally depended upon,"This book was thorough with explaining each of the main topics and it has everything major in european history that you need to know for the ap test. However, this book had NO MENTION whatsoever of the social aspect of european history. AP has begun to add more social history questions, and this book did not include any of it. In addition, there were grammar and spelling mistakes. There also weren't enough practice tests, but they gave a pretty good indicator of what you would get on the real AP, excluding the DBQ and essays. So this book is good to use if you want to use it as a supplemental book to your AP class, but do not solely use it for the AP."
1,European History (Cliffs AP),"Book is a text book for some type of school. Relates little to past history of Europe. Doesn't belong in the category of ""European History. I should not have bought it and threw it away."
2,"Don't get this one, it's not worth it","I became familiar with all three major books on this subject while studying (Cliffs, Princeton Review, & Kaplan) and this one is the worst. Its 2002 publication date is fatally old for a book that is supposed to cover a constantly morphing test, and most importantly, the practice exams in the back are WAY too easy.The summaries are good, but for your money, you might as well get one of the other two, since they have better practice tests. Princeton did it for me personally; they also have a good breakdown of how you need to take the test itself.I implore you not to waste your money here, at least until they publish an updated version."
4,"AP European History Exam was a booger, this book helped","I took AP European History over the '06-'07 school year. It's a good class to take. Now, European History is so broad that it is one of the hardest histories for people to understand.Use this book to review for your AP exam at least a month in advance.- I did not start early. This book is great if you have enough time to digest the contents. If you are starting late, get theCracking the AP European History Exam, 2006-2007 Edition (College Test Prep)instead.- Use this book throughout the school year. It would have been amazing to have when I was reviewing for test. It has great charts and graphs. There are also review checks after the end of each section.*Also note, one of the reasons that I gave this book a four was because of minor inaccuracies."
1,The weakest of the review books,My friends and I each got different AP Euro review books for the exam. I had the bad luck to get the Cliffs. We used them all for our study sessions. We all decided that Cliffs was the all time worst!It's like its for remedial not AP students. Too simple questions. Bad writing. Sketchy history review notes.We read the great review somebody in PA wrote and decided it must have been the author's relative.
1,I study everyday with this book since December and failed!,"I am a student of Galileo in San Francisco. I have been studying for the AP test since December. I used this book everyday and memorized the timelines and almost the entire book from left to right. On test day, I was f-cked by all the questions. The book's tests were too easy and the review turned out to be too general to do well on the AP test. I recommend reading and memorizing the notes you take from your teacher since they are almost always 1000 times more helpful than this book."
4,Excellent material and easy to follow,This is an easy to follow study guide which covers a wide range of European History. The practice tests seem practical and easy to follow. I'm sure that it will increase my daughter's score.
1,"maybe, maybe not","I guess there could possibly be a greater waste of time, but I cannot see how. Maybe I could coin a phrase to describe this mindlessness: celluloid torture."
1,Adam Sandler hits rock bottom with this movie!!!!,"This movie from the first 15 mins was already boring me and not getting a single laugh out of me. After seeing some great movies from Adam Sandler, this was a definite disappointment in every way. Every part you had seen in the previews were considered the funniest parts of the movie weren't even funny when the movie was put all together. Adam Sandler has to do 110% better to get all of his fans back, because this movie was by far the worst movie of his career! See it only if your curious. If not skip it all together!"
1,Jack and Jill,"By now, enough has been written about Jack and Jill that there's really no reason to beat up on it any more; that horse has been dead for a while. The most recent condemnation came when the Adam Sandler vehicle racked up a whopping 12 Razzie nominations, a feat made even more impressive by the fact that there are only 10 categories. Directed by Dennis Dugan, who has inexplicably cobbled together a career out of several terrible films, Jack and Jill is a screwball comedy about an advertising exec who receives an annual visit from his twin sister, who happens to drive him crazy. Despite an amusing extended cameo by Al Pacino -- playing himself -- Jack and Jill failed to impress me. If you're a big fan of Sandler's other films, you may get somewhat of a kick out of it, but if not, it's probably best to steer clear."
1,Waste of Time and Money,"The whole time I kept thinking ""what a waste of my time"". I kept waiting for funny moments, they never came. Adam Sandler just needs to stop making movies, he used to be good, not anymore."
2,Painful to Watch,"I really thought I would like this, as I am a fan of Adam Sandler, but this movie is just awful. Not because of the potty humor - Sandler is famous (infamous?) for that, it is what we expect. But watching the character of Jill is absolutely painful! It is simply way too over the top. I couldn't believe that someone attached to the movie (like the producer or director) would let this get through. I was also shocked that Al Pacino agreed to be in it. Part of the storyline is that Jack is trying to get Al Pacino to appear in a Dunkin Donuts commercial, which they figure he would never do. I'm not sure why, because this movie is far worse than any commercial I have ever seen. Sometimes I think they start out with the best of intentions but the movie never comes together. This is one of those cases."
1,I would give NEGATIVE stars if I could..BORING!,"Possibly the most boring movie I have ever sat thru. Thank goodness it was only an hour and a half. Right at the 30 minute mark, I was thinking..how in the world can they draw this terrible movie out another hour?!Yes, it really is THAT BAD. It isn't even funny..nothing stupid, or typical ""Adam Sandler"" about it. Save yourself the time and money and SKIP THIS ONE!The only reason we kept this one in and didn't turn it off is b/c my husband and I kept thinking it would improve. We were wrong. It got worse. It is like one of those bad SNL skits...the kind that are more stupid than funny and they don't know how or when to end it so they drag it out WAY longer than it should be.We just did not find any humor at all in this one. Very disappointing."
1,Movie,This may have been a very good movie but it was removed from my Kindle Fire before I had the time to actually watch it.
2,So disappointed.,"The best part about this movie is the real twin interviews at the beginning and end which isn't even part of the actual movie. The rest was a let down in my opinion. I love Adam Sandler but this movie sucked. There were so many talented people in it and it still sucked.On a side note, Al Pacino is a hack and couldn't act if he tried. He is the same character in every movie, how is that acting?"
2,It's an Adam Sandler movie. What did you expect?,"If you watched this movie knowing it starred Adam Sandler, then you must have known it would be his typical humor. I had preconceived notions on what to expect from this movie and it surely lived up to my expectations. If I wanted to watch an intelligent, complex and emotionally driven movie I would have chosen something else.This IS Adam Sandler and all of his movies smell the same."
2,"Just not a good film, a one time watcher","I have been a big fan of Adam Sandler over the years, and seeing the concept of the movie and the previews for it, it looked like it could have been another one of his classic style of comedies (Like Billy Madison, Mr. Deeds, Happy Gilmour), but after watching it, it just didn't come together. They have a good cast, great material for the twin thing to work, but huge story gaps at times that make the film jumpy, and script wise, it just didn't deliver on the laughs for me. The character development was set up enough, but it just wasn't there. I would highly recommend renting this, or catch it on a premium cable channel so you don't have to have this collecting dust on your shelf. A one time watch, then discard."
3,bahahahahahahaha,"It's Adam Sadler for goodness sakes! No one expected miracles, this movie is strictly for stupid fun. Alot of the stunts or jokes you see coming a mile away. Just plain fun!"
1,Remember Lot's wife,"Adam long ago joined the ranks of ""esteemed"" actorsthat have donned women's apparel for all the worldto see: Snipes, Russel, Liguizamo, Mackulay, Hanks,Hoffman, Murphy, Farley, Spade, Rock, Foxx, Curry,Swayze, Schrieber, Wayans Bros., Carey, Timberlake,Law, Depp, Lawrence, Travolta, Gylenhaal, Pearce,Rodman, Duchovny, Gooding Jr., Cilian Murphy, Tyson,Chan, Tucker, Schwarzenegger, Franco, Prince, Cera,De Niro, Meyers, Short, Carvey and Craig... just toname a few.One might get the impression that it's contractualobligation. Perhaps not, if you consider Chappelle'sunexpected trip to Africa.It's incredible what people do for filthy lucre;to possess temporal objects where moth and rustdoth corrupt.Deuteronomy 22:5"
4,I love stupid comedy!,"Some people say this movie is horrible, but not me. Its probably not for everyone. Unless you like stupid humor and Adam Sandler. I bought this movie for my Dad because he loved it when we saw it in the theater. Yes, its stupid but what did you expect with Adam Sandler. Besides, life is hard enough I""ll take humor where ever I can get it."
5,Jack and jill.,I rated it a five because when I watch the movie it was phenomenal. I like it so much because it is funny it is adventurous and it has the right actors like Jonny Depp and Adam Slandler.
2,Couldn't finish,"Oh man, I expected that all the negative reviews might have been people looking for something that wasn't there... which was true in a way I didn't expect. So glad I rented this and didn't buy it, it was painful from the minute I met Jill, Adam Sandler is a good actor, but this was overdoing it.Just to be clear, I can't think of a single movie I haven't just at least willed myself through, I mean, I paid for it, might as well watch it and hopefully it will get better. There was no way I was going to survive this whole movie, and I skipped around just to see if anything caught my attention."
2,I ain't gonna lie...,"The movie had it funny parts but it all revolved around potty and/or body humor. I have to say that Adam Sandlers girl character seemed to be funnier than his boy character in this movie, it almost seemed like Adam Sandler himself did not want to be in this movie as a guy. There are numerous cameos from a lot of movie and sports people. I also have to admit to falling asleep during the last 15 minutes or so (we rented the DVD) so the movie isn't engaging enough to keep you awake (strike 1). Not much else to say about this one, I am pretty sure there is no sequel in the future."
2,Adam Sandler not at his best....or worst.,Not very funny to me. Really did not live up to the hype. Should have paid more attention to the reviews.
2,Crap,"I'm a big fan of most Adam Sandler movies but I'll be blunt, this was a terrible movie... I don't know what Adam Sandler was thinking. I wish I could unsee this movie. That's pretty much all I have to say about it. I don't know how they loured Al Pacino into being a part of this disaster."
4,Silly,This is a funny movie I would recommend this to teenagers and up. Adam Sandler is a very funny man and he showed his sense of humor in this movie.
1,Would not play,The DVD would not play. I tried it on multiple DVD players so something must have gone wrong when it was copies.
1,One word: Atrocious,"Jack and Jill is an abomination. I've list of things your money would be better spent on than purchasing this movie:-Twenty McDonald's cheeseburgers-Putting a tire on layaway-Burning your money-Making a long distance phone call to somebody you don't know-Gallons of milk, then leaving them out in the sun for a week and pouring them all over your body-Printer paper-Paying somebody to slowly insert toothpicks into your eyeballs"
1,Booooorrrrrrriiiiinnnnngggggg!!!!!!,"I wouldn't spend two cents on this movie! What a totalwaste of time and acting ability. Good thing they hadsupporting actors, this was a flop."
1,An Embarrassment,"As I sat through this horrific piece of crap I kept thinking how embarrassed I was for such a great actor like Al Pacino to be in it. He needs to fire his agent or whoever it was that thought being a part of this travesty would be a good career move. Don't get me wrong, Adam Sander can be funny. The Wedding Singer, Big Daddy, and 50 First Dates are among his best. This film will rank as not only one of the worst Sandler films, but one of the worst films I've seen in a very long time."
3,"Pretty funny, but predictable funny","The movie was pretty good and funny with somewhat of a meaning behind it. If you are an Adam Sandler fan, it's worth the watch."
1,What Happened?,Jack and JillI am an Adam Sandler fan. I enjoy his comedy and can always find a laugh in what he does.Not this time folks. I have no idea what happened to him. JACK AND JILL was absolutely theworst movie I've seen in my 64 years. I can not believe that Mr. Sandler had the guts to actuallyput this out for the public to view.Adam plays Jack and his twin Sister. He should have found a female to be his sister. It might havemade this flop a slightly bit less terrible. I found nothing funny with his portrayal of a female / sister.Sandler just doesn't do women well or funny.We all know that Adam Sandler can be very funny and very believable. I would like him to go backto doing those things. I sure wasted my money this time. I bought this video based on his name.What a mistake that was.I am truly sorry Mr. Sandler. I wish this review could be better than terrible.
1,What a Disappointment,"I thought it was going to be a great film probably because I saw Adam Sandler, but it wasn't. Al Pacino is also here, but he was horrible as well. Katie Holmes is also here as well as Johnny Depp. They are okay, but they alone can't save this movie. I did not laugh at all, and I think this is supposed to be a comedy. So I won't recommend this film to anyone. Save your time and money or you'll be sorry."
4,"The funniest Adam Sandler movie I've seen in years, and the only one that is safe for kids to watch...","I watched this movie twice this past weekend - once with my wife, and then again with my kids. I found it to be very funny, and surprisingly free of profanity and sexual innuendos - something that I tend to expect with Adam Sandler movies. This was a nice change of pace for him, and for me. I laughed a lot in this movie, and after discovering that it was pretty safe for kids, I let them watch it with me the next night. Big, big laughs from my kids!I liked the movie a lot, and would definitely watch it again. It's pure amusement, so don't go into it expecting anything that will engage your brain, but some nights that's all you need."
3,It's OK,"This movie delivers a few laughs, but overall it's not that great. Jack and Jill is appropriate for most audiences which gives the movie a plus in terms of family entertainment. Al Pacino also stars in this film and Johnny Depp has a cameo. I can't determine who the old lady at the picnic is under that crazy disguise!"
2,Jack and Jill DVD Movie - very disappointing....,"I am sorry that I wasted my money purchasing this item. It seemed like it would be a great movie, but I did not enjoy it at all. Sorry guys...."
3,Jack and Jill,"People are being a bit dramatic. I think a lot of movies have predictable humor, but that doesn't make the movie terrible. I am a huge Sandler fan, so I might just be partial to anything with him in it, but I thought this movie was worth watching at least once, especially if you're a Sandler fan. JUST BECAUSE SOMEONE MAKES A MOVIE THAT YOU DON'T LIKE DOESN'T MEAN THEY SHOULD NEVER MAKE ANOTHER MOVIE. Sandler has PLENTY of amazing films. This one may not of been the best, but it's definitely not near as bad as people are making it out to be! Give it a try :)"
5,Another hit in the franchise!,"I loved this movie, rented and watched it twice , now im buying it. The physical comedy is tremendous, the writing clever pointed and side splitting. The only thing i questioned was the casting choice for his wife, i felt she was a flat note. I enjoyed sandler in duel roles, esp the jump rope scene. This is a movie about family. I question the motives of negative reviewers for this movie."
4,Kindof a Two-fer,"You know what to expect with an Adam Sandler movie: the humor even kids get (and sometimes ONLY kids get). ""Jack and Jill"" fulfills that expectation. The fart and diarrhea jokes are a bit too much, but the kids liked them. The basic premise for the story made this a family movie, the slap stick kind of humor helped to keep the kids entertained so they were still attentive when the moral came at the end."
1,What a Waste of Talent!,"I am a huge Adam Sandler and Al Pachino fan, but wow these guys must really need the money to take part in a horrible movie like this!Poor acting, script and horrible concept for a movie. I can't believe I wasted 90 minutes and $3.99 of my hard earned money on this waste of a film.Please, save your money and NEVER SEE THIS MOVIE!"
1,Sandler Hits an All-Time Low,"Throughout his largely misbegotten career, Adam Sandler has made a few decent comedies - ""The Wedding Singer"" comes to mind - but ""Jack and Jill"" (2011) is the pits. Sandler and his filmmaking buddies show contempt for their audience while delivering zero laughs. A bizarre cameo by Al Pacino (who should have known better) remains the sole redeeming feature of a truly wretched movie."
1,The Worst Movie of All Time?,"This is without a doubt, one of the worst movies ever made. It has been said that it was basically made as a way for Sandler to scam the studio out of several millions of dollars while giving his friends quick cameo roles for large salaries. Do not pay to see this movie."
1,Worst movie ever.,Just plain horrible....This movie just totally sucked...Do not waste your time or money. Price was totally nuts. Expected much more.
1,Don't waste your time,This was a horrible movie. My 11 year old son thought it was kind of funny. Husband couldn't even sit through half of it. I expect more from Adam Sandler.
1,Absolutely Horrible,"I want the hour and a half of my life that I wasted watching this atrocious film, I expected much more from Adam Sandler and Al Pacino. Their careers certainly have taken a nose dive. Save yourself the time, frustration, and money and don't rent or buy this movie."
4,better than expected,I laughed all the way through it. I had very low expectations so i was very pleasantly surprised by this film. Very very funny!!!
1,Check out the review for yourself.,"Really there isn't more to say than the fact that this has the lowest metacritic score ever.It is just one really long commercial with no heart or story. I really pity you if you have to watch this film. If you bought it, I would take it back."
1,worst movie I have seen,I was looking forward to seeing this movie... so I rented it for 5.00 on my cable on demand. I usually can watch dumb movies but this is far past dumb. I wasted 5 dollars and over an hour of my life I will never get back. Thinking of Adam Sandler I thought it would be a good movie. I was wrong it was horrible.
1,The worst movie I have seen. Period,"It's been a long time since I have watched a movie this bad. The bathroom humor is awful. F.Y.I. Don't see itwith a date. I was watching this movie and thought, isn't this embarrassing for Katie Holmes? Her rolewas very meek and mild wife of Sandler. The twin idea just didn't work. HUGE MESS OVERALL."
2,Two Thumbs Down,This movie had very few funny moments but overall not very funny. Al Pacino was interesting and very odd in this movie.
5,Sandler Strikes Again,"Sandler and his gang of good timers strikes again with a funny yet touching movie about twins. His schtick just improves with time, and may he keep going for years and years, because the movies will just be funnier and funnier."
3,Jack and Jill - Hysterical in its Awfulness,"I love Adam Sandler, so when this movie came out, despite the obvious flaws in the idea, I had to see it.I saw it.I am giving it 3 stars because it is such an awful movie that you just have to laugh. What was Adam Sandler thinking? Is he in debt? Did he just need an excuse to dress like a woman? I don't know but I do know that despite myself I found myself laughing at some of the tomfoolery on the screen so although I can't say I recommend it for its cinematography, I can recommend it to all of those who can appreciate a truly ill made, ill conceived movie."
3,It was cute,"If you like Adam Sandler you will probably enjoy this movie. He did a good job playing both parts. The story was different, not something that has been done to death."
3,IT HAS IT'S MOMENTS,"It has it's moments however few. Now don't get me wrong my wife laughed her backside off. Me, well I found a moment or two that made me chuckle; mainly the horse collapsing under Jill. Now spare me the that is cruel garbage. If I were to jump on that same horse the movie would have ended there for cruelty to animals. Ok it had a couple more but they elude me at the moment, it has been a couple of weeks since I watched it. Try to catch it in the Deal section. It is worth a couple of bucks."
3,Jack and Jill,"Didn't watch, one thing about a kindle fire, and Amazon, if u rent a movie and u have 30 days to watch it there is no where it is stored to remember u rented it..lol so forgot I rented it. but heard it is good!"
3,Not the Sandler I remember,"Sure, Adam Sandler has made much better movies. Sure Katie Holmes ruins any movie. But all in all this was ok. I laughed here and there, but seeing Adam in drag is worth the price. All great actors must go drag at some point, this is not Big Momma or Tootsie or even White Chicks, but for the few laughable moments and constant drag makeup I give it a passing grade of C. I love Sandler but this one was not up with his better films. I bought this without seeing it in theatres as planned, but I really do not regret it. It is just another addition to my Sandler collection."
2,So not funny it is painful to watch,"I recommend watching the review made by the guys from ""Half in the Bag"" from redlettermedia dot com and then if you still consider yourself a true Adam Sandler fan go ahead and watch the movie. The acting is horrible and mostly stupid, specially during the time when both Adams are in the screen. The jokes are racist most of the time and they aren't even that funny to begin with. To sum it up, there's literally a commercial for royal Caribbean inside the movie."
1,Horrible,The worst Adam Sandler movie yet. Completely unwatchable. Why was Al Pacino in this crap? Adam Sandler... please retire. If you can't write a movie any longer... don't.
1,Atrocious,"Stopped watching after 20 minutes, that's saying something of how awful it is. Adam Sandler is at his worst here. Not funny, stupid, waste of time. One of the worst movies of the year."
1,I there was a negative star option I would choose one.,"Lets put it this way, it is amazing that this didn't go straight to video. The story is bad, the acting is bad (which was strange because I usually like Adam Sandler movies)and it just wasn't funny."
3,Oh lighten up!,"I don't know, is it The Princess Bride? No! Is it clever - no. Is it Adam Sandler being Adam Sandler - yes. Not Adam Sandler in Punch Drunk Love or Spanglish, but Adam Sandler from every other fall down stupid over the top silly movie he's made. There are parts that are painfully awful, there are parts that are just laugh out loud funny, but I pretty much smiled through the whole thing, so did I get my $1.99 worth - yes, I did."
1,Product Placement Anyone?,"As I read through the reviews no one stressed the blatant product placement by the companies that Sandler has involvement in. This movie was so bad on so many levels. I found it also disheartening that so many people like diarrhea and fart jokes. What in the world is so incredibly funny about those things? The movie is also openly racist in addition to thinking it is funny to knock over old people? Where is the joke and why is that funny? What does that say about the American psyche that thinks that?This movie cost $79 million to make, lots of apperances by Sandler's buddies. Lots of money from advertisers, so where did the money go? Why so much? Anyone asking why it costs so much money to make such an incredibly lousy and lazy movie?"
5,We All Love This Movie,"First off, I know this movie received plenty of poor reviews. I honestly don't know why. This movie makes all of us laugh. We watch it about once a month and it never gets old. Adam Sandler has done it again."
2,"A lot of great people in the movie, horrible plot, not funny.","This movie really disappointed. The plot was stupid and even with Al Pacino and Adam Sandler, it still sucked. Adam Sandler movies are starting to go down hill. Not sure I'll waste my time on a next one; if there is a next one."
2,How can you have so many stars & such a stinker???,"Movie had potential, but was overtly unbelievable to the point that it wasnt too funny. Jill walked like a man (to put it mildly) and didnt really look feminine in any way. She was over the top in acting (or should I say adam sandler was). Such a shame because there were so many famous people in the movie that it had the opportunity to be hilarious and fun.....but Jill was just overly annoying. Maybe if it was a man with more slender legs, thinner hands and one that was capable of walking without his legs so far apart, like how a dude walks, and not so much yell talking by Jill, this maybe maybe could have been really funny."
2,Blah,"When I seen the previews for this movie... I was very excited to see a new Adam Sandler movie coming to theatres. Adam Sandler's brand of comedy is definitely unique, so I was very eager to see his spin on playing his ""twin"".There are funny scenes in the movie, but it seemed stale to me. Even with adding Al Pacino to the cast.. this movie still fell flat.I guess it time to pop in GROWN UPS dvd to get a real laugh from Adam.."
3,Worth watching/ especially through Redbox,"Al Pacino is awesome in this movie and while this movie isn't a 4 or 5 star rating it is worth watching. Don't read those 1 star reviews any longer because those people obviously were expecting ""Oscar"" level material when it is obvious this is simply a family fun type comedy."
1,Adam Sandler has lost it and is making garbage!,i SAW THIS MOVIE AND I THOUGHT I WAS CRAP FROM BEGINNING TO END. THE BEST PART ENDING CREDITS. DON'T WAIST YOUR MONEY.
3,Good cap,This cap looks great and it's the color I wanted. I ordered an XL because I thought I had a big melon head but I guess it wasn't that big should have ordered a large instead.
3,OK for the price but be careful of width.,"The shoes are nice looking for what they are. Not a real comfort shoe and seem a bit simple inside (like no padding), but I wanted them for a retro event and they look the part. I'm more of a size E and they are tight in the forward area or toe box so I'll be bringing them in to se if a repair shop can stretch a small amount. I think it's their only width and that's unfortunate. We'll see how it works out."
3,Pretty good,"I've always wanted a pair of these but didn't know what they were called until recently. I saw these shoes in a department store several years ago, but they don't carry them anymore. Luckily, they're available online.While these shoes are quite comfortable, they don't seem quite as well made as I was expecting. The shoelaces they came with are too short and I had to buy longer ones. The patent leather finish is a little too dressy for casual wear, so I'll save these for wearing with my suit or a tuxedo."
4,Piccolo's Revenge Continue,DragonballZ Frieza Revealed is a great DVD to own if you want to collect all of Dragonballz DVD's also if you like Piccolo. It starts of where the battle with Piccolo and Frieza left off in Transformation. Also Frieza transforms into his utlimate form and battles Vegeta the Prince of all Saiyans. Try to Collect the all of the DBZ DVD's because they include the orginal Japanese version.
4,The Many Forms of Frieza,"This DVD is great, Frieza goes from his second form to his final form throughout these 3 episodes. There's lots of action and great music. Although the voice acting isn't that great during this period, the Japanese version makes up for it. I really wish Funimation would put some new extras on these DVDs. My ultimate goal is to get all of the episodes on DVD and I'm getting tired of the same old commercials as extras. It would be nice if they added character profiles or interviews with the voice actors or something."
1,Do Not Purchase!,"I purchased this exact board from FRY's Outpost about 4 months ago. And I have had problems with it ever since. AMD is known to run hotter than Pen/Cel. but this is just crazy. Even with a fan it still no longer is working. I was checking my email, when all of a sudden my monitor just died. Went black. I tried changing monitors, graphic cards etc. Nothing works! However I know that it is still getting power. I contacted ECS and they told me to just contact my vendor. This was the 3rd time I would have had to return it. So, at this time I am fighting with the company, until they replace it. My advise, if you see the name ECS- RUN AWAY!!!"
1,mhhh....,If you love hip hop then don't buy this video. It's a mix of movements that are NOT hip hop.
4,Not bad,"Well if you dont know the moves, it is pretty good tool in learning it from this dvd but if you know a lot , might as well attend a dance class on hiphop.I had fun with this but I find this dvd put together so simply from a person who knows how to edit dvd but then again I have not seen the other products.THe instruction goes fast if you dont know how your body moves yet but replay and slow play playback helps."
4,The Seminal Work in Tool History,"During his lifetime, Henry Mercer was a lawyer, archaeologist, museum curator, promoter of lost crafts, and collector of a museum's worth (literally) of assorted stuff. One of his many interests was early American woodworking tools.Ancient Carpenter's Tools is a comprehensive look at 18th and 19th Century American woodworking tools. The book is divided into chapters by function (Measurement, Shaping, etc.) and then by type of tool. As American tools were heavily influenced by their European ancestors, Mercer also includes a history of each tool with references to Medieval and Classical tools. Each tool is illustrated with photographs and drawings.While this book was originally published in the 1920's (and occasionally shows its age) it remains useful for any student of tool history."
3,Kenny and Spenny Do Hollywood,"I am a fan of the Kenny and Spenny Show. I wanted to check out some of Kenny Hotz's documentary work and found 'Pitch' on DVD. I must say that it is a good and competant piece of film making. But I must also say that it is not 'great'. I am really kind of middle of the road about it so I gave it a 3 star review. It lacked a lot of the laughs that I thought we might see but it did show the 'Catch-22's', the run around and the almost ridiculous rat race that is Hollywood.I would recommend it to fans of the show and to fans of documentaries. It is not for everybody."
5,Danny Write - Real Romance,I like the way Danny plays the piano - he provides easy listening. I own most of his music and have enjoyed his style of playing for many years.
1,INTRODUCTION TO GEOPOLITICS,"The Ottoman Empire was not established in mid-1400s ! The Ottoman Empire was established in XIII th century, not in XV th century."
2,False advertising,"I had ordered this book from this seller because I needed it fairly quickly and their profile said it would ship from CA. I waited 1.5 weeks and finally emailed to inquire about the status of this shipment, only to find out the book had actually been shipped from the UK!! The comments are misleading by saying it may ship from a different location...why is the seller saying the book is available from CA if it's not!! ? Please be careful if you need speedy delivery."
1,"Poor design, cheap construction, difficult to adjust","This appears to be hand made one item at a time. Each unit is therefore slightly different with respect to fit, tolerances, dimensions. Poor design and manufacture. This looks like a cheap product. It is not finished. Wood is rough at edges, apparently not even sanded let alone finished or stained. Height adjustment not smooth. Very heavy, cumbersome, too large. Not at all pleasureful to use. Not even close to smoothness and efficiency of calf muscle exercise machines at gym. I ""used it"" (to the extent possible given flaws) once."
4,Needs more stability,"Overall I would say this is an excellent product for the price. The description says the plastic is rated to 500lbs, but when a 200lb person stands on it, it tends to sag. It also is not very non-slip as stated. The plastic has some grooves on it, but it doesn't really help. I may add some non-skid tape to it to make it safer. I am curious to see how long this product will last before breaking."
3,The Gift of Taking,"Dr. Jill Kahn and her husband Danny seemed to have it all, but still weren't happy. They ignored that emotional emptiness until Danny received a diagnosis of a malignant brain tumor. That wake-up call forced them to look at their lives more analytically. In her search, Dr. Jill learned if we constantly give of ourselves and never take the time or effort to ""fill our own wells"", we can't survive--physically or spiritually. We must first ask ourselves what we truly desire before we can pray to receive God's intended gifts.Read The Gift of Taking today and learn what she has taught many of her patients. You, too, can live a full, satisfying life. It's there just for the taking.--Becky at Author, Author!"
1,Worst thing ever,I hate this encyclopedia because it doent work for Macintosh computers!!!! If anyone gets a chance please tell them to make it for Macintosh computers!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
5,The perfect food for our senior cat.,"We have an 18 year old cat with serious digestion problems including regular vomiting and diarrhea to the point where she was dehydrated and very underweight. We were running out of things to try untill I heard of Wysong Geriatrx and decided to try it. All I can say is, this food has quite literally saved her life."
1,Cats do not like.,"After many weeks I realized the cat container of Wysong Geriatrix was not emptying. Cats do not like it anymore. It used to be one of their treats. Did the formula change, says new on a label."
1,Does not work,"Received order but no directions. Plugged it into my computer and nothing happens. Red light flashes, but thats it. Would not order again."
2,"Works but too slow, would not recommend it","Product works in general, but since it is thicker and wider than a regular USB thumb drive, you may run into interference with the other devices in the system. One major drawback of the device is it is way too slow for the USB 2.0 as advertised. I attempted to transfer a 4GB video file from a class 10 SD of a camera over to the hard drive; windows estimates it will take 160 minutes to complete. I aborted the copy after about 15 minutes. With built-in SD reader, this takes only just over five minutes to complete. Even changing file viewing from ""details"" to ""icon"" took several minutes for a card with over a hundred of pictures; and since it is so slow, you can not play video clip directly out of it. So if you are serious about using it for large file transfer, invest in something faster.Even for the low price, I would not recommend this product."
2,used no more than 20 times no longer works,got 2 ... one quit last week the other this weekthey were not abused..only sat in a bag in drawerwhen not in use.the sd cards & micro sd cards are fine...justwon't read in these adapters any morebig disappointment...no reason they should not last forever
1,Did not work,The product did not work. It has no inlet to plug in any of the SD cards - not even one and they claim 10 in 1.Thanks to the suppliers for promptly refunding the payment.
2,Computer doesn't recognize USB device,"I tried this on a Vista machine, Win 2K and also XP - none of them recognize the reader. Just says there is no driver for the device. Of course I tossed out the packaging so I can't send it back, but for $5, it's not worth it. Anybody else have this problem?"
1,Doesn't work,It plugs in. It flashes. Then it just sits there like a rock. I tried troubleshooting. I tried different cards. Nothing.
2,Does not fit 2000 BMW 323i,"This Pentius PAB5350 filter does NOT fit my 2000 BMW 323i, because the rubber molding on top is uneven and too thick/wide and the engine filter cover cannot completely close over the filter.Much better to go with the Fram CA 9007Fram CA9007 Extra Guard Flexible Panel Air, it is made exactly to BMW specifications and fits perfectly."
3,This book was O.K,"The overall book was pretty good, especially the part where amy went to the sleepover at the unicorns with ashley and Liz."
5,Great Collection of a under rated cartoon,"Lasting only one year, C.O.P.S. or the Central Office of Police Specialists was G.I. Joe, only with police officers. It was a light hearted show that deserved a special place in 1980's animation classics. You'll never see this type of work in an animated show ever again. If you grew up in the 80's, you might have never saw this good show. It's a very simple premise: Cops vs. super bad guys and it brings back lots of memories. For only 10 dollars or so you can get the volumes one and two. If you don't mind not getting the extras, it's a basic set of three discs with the first 32 episodes. The packaging is unusual in that the indivdual discs are in paper sleeves. They are still protected and preserved from harm though it's case. It was probably a cost saving move on the part of the company. If you can get past the good but untraditional packaging, it's an economical way to enjoy some great animation."
4,Great Solution to my Problem,"This product fixed my problem. Just as my 9 month old noticed that HDMI and Component cables are really fun to tug on I went and got this. Easily hides 2 hdmi, component, xbox, and a few RCA cables. You can paint this to match your wall. Only complaint is the 3m sticky tape, save yourself and screw this in as it peels away from latex paint."
1,Piece of Junk,"This company appears to make the worst ""budget"" DVDS (ie: sold in dollar stores) on the market. I've been burned before but I took a chance since I'm a fan of Richard Greene's and had never seen CAPTAIN SCARLETT. Well guess what - CAPTAIN SCARLETT is not on this DVD!!! In it's place we have the 1933 version of THE SCARLETT LETTER - with the opening and closing credits missing!!I flipped it over to check out MUTINY and it is there at least but the print is pretty bad, washed out colors, scratchy, lines, etc. I will do my best to avoid this company's product in the future - although I don't see the actual company name anywhere on the covers!! Unless it is ""Family Value Collections"" which is written in a small box on the box. The DVD covers are similar though for their various titles so they are easy to spot. I realize you can't expect perfection for a buck but at least you do have a right to expect the movie that is supposed to be on the DVD!!"
4,juicy! har har.,"sorry about the joke above. in short, the album's a miracle if for no other reason that it makes alt-rock moodiness look almost fresh again. structure-wise, there's only one real nod to their previous wonderfully dark album 'don ron' ('tear the sky'), but the snarling guitar diatribes like 'twilight' and barely-contained acoustic meditations like 'necessary evil' and 'the sight of you' kick you in the head, strew it with metaphors, shake it around a little, and leave one beautiful exit wound."
5,Offensive Line Drills,A great product specific to the positions on the field. Most general coaching manuals are way too vague - this one hits the nail on the head.
2,Not the same as when I was a toddler,"I ordered the videos for my son as I loved Paddington growing up. Well, my three year old was just as bored as I was."
1,Rings are not low,"These rings may say ""low"", but they are quite high. They are higher than the rings that came with my scope, and those were too high. With these rings, the distance from the top of the receiver to the bottom of the scope will be .622"". This is OK if you like a chin weld over a cheek weld. Very disappointed."
2,Good Practice,"The Kaplan MCAT workbook gives a couple helpful hints when taking the MCAT. The hints are about how you take the test and some information about what the MCAT is, but says nothing about what you should study. The workbook, however, has some work sections and a practice test that do reflect the real MCAT. If you want practice test though, actual past tests have been released which you can look over."
5,Great explanations,"I'm so glad I found this book! Yeah, I'm great at organic chem and calculus, but I HATE taking multiple-choice tests! But Kaplan's workbook let me practice, practice, practice, until I had the test-taking strategies down pat. And those questions I did get wrong were immediately clarified by the detailed explanations."
4,nice book,Good instruction and cute dolls. Maybe not current fads but that's okay. Some oldies are goodies! The book is in very good condition.
3,a decent book on a great topic,"This is an anthology by female law professors of color. They explore legal and political issues that affect women of color, emphasizing how most ppl think all the people of color are male and all the women are white. It has a range of articles by Black, Latina, and Asian women. My only critique is that it is overedited. I'd rather read an entire article by Patricia Williams or Angela Harris, rather than a snippet. I would say this book is a good starting point for ppl intent on studying other books and law articles for greater depth in the area."
5,Exceptional.,Exceptional and the essays are fluidly written. Good for both legal professionals and non-law trained thinkers.
1,Yuck,"No comments needed...his dog came out in the middle of the video and started playing with him!Funny, but this video sucked."
1,It's a copy of the 1st volume,This is a word for word copy of the first volume with part of the 1st chapter changed around a bit. What a disappointment! I've run into this sort of thing with a few authors and I don't like it. This one particularly bothers me because Lynn Abbey is one of my favorite authors to read.
3,"Good story line, but could of been written better","I didn't like this book much because, the writer skipped between the characters minds and I had a hard time following everytime she skipped between.The story plot, in its self, was good. I liked the way the plot ran and how it kept you wondering at the end.The only problem that I had was the writing. I would settle into the story as one persons point of view and then she would change it.Over all if you could deal with re-reading paragraphs to find out how shes talking about, the book it worth reading. I wouldn't read it again though."
1,Carven Vetiver Must be very old stock,"This Vetiver by Carven must have come from a truly ancient stock. The slight scent that remains virtually vanishes moments after spraying, leaving an unpleasant miasma vaguely reminiscent of Drano. I've had it from Saks and know what it should smell like. Too much trouble to return; buyer beware!"
1,No fragrance,"I am familiar with this product. My father started using it in the 1970s. I bought this as a present for someone else. I ended up keeping it for myself. I opened the package and bottle this weekend. The ""cologne"" had no fragrance. I don't know whether it was exposed to the sun or was too old, or what. What I got isn't cologne, it's a tinted bottle of alcohol."
1,Misleading information,"I received the wrong product, not the one in the advertised picture. It was misleading information. When trying to return, a message comes up staing that it cannot be returned for harzardous reasons.Careful, do NOT BUY THIS ITEM!!!!!!"
4,¡EXCELENTE!,Una excelente loción. El aroma del vetiver es de mis favoritos y Carven logro hacer un producto fantástico.
1,Abhorrent Sound Ruins It All,"Such a pity. Mehta, a master in interpreting Mahler's scores, does a sterling job of conducting the Israel Philharmonic, which does an equally sterling job of playing. The picture quality is razor sharp. And then along comes a sound track that has, throughout the tape, a background hiss that cannot be ignored (it's not the speakers---I'm running a Bose Lifestyle system.) The hiss is particularly noticeable and grating during the symphony's quiet passages, and dominated every bit of enjoyment I was trying so hard to maintain. Don't buy it. Wait until it comes out on DVD (if it does), and then check the reviews (if any) to see if the hiss was edited out during VHS/DVD transfer. Bottom Line: A major disappointment and a mark of technical shame on whatever sound studio was responsible for cutting the master tape."
4,Where there's a will there's a way.,I really enjoyed reading Stone Fox. I thought it was a good book. It shows a strong relationship between a boy and a grandfather. It talked about the bond between a boy and a dog during tough times. My favorite part was when Little Willy decieded to enter the dog sled race to win money to save his grandfathers farm. It showed courage and hope. It was very inspiring but sad at the same time.
1,CANNOT CHANGE BATTERY YOURSELF,"I liked the calculator size, ease of use, etc. Then I read the fine print that says not to attempt to change the battery yourself. You have to pay to send it or bring it to a Canon dealer to do it for you. I think the original price is plenty to pay for this calculator without having to pay extra every time you need to change a battery. I am requesting a refund. Buyers beware. Nowhere did I read on Amazon's description about having this extra headache. I want a calculator to reduce my headaches, not add to them. I don't want to have to worry about how long it will take to get the battery changed and therefore be without a calculator. It shouldn't be that hard to change a battery on a simple calculator. Just another way to make money for themselves. No thanks."
2,A Personal Bio,"I bought this book hoping for an objective assessment of the benefits of hip replacement versus hip resurfacing. It does not come close to the promise of its title. Basically, it is a description of the author's experience, which, though valid, does not provide an objective perspective. There are a few useful words of advice, but overall this book is an advocacy platform for resurfacing. Having said that, I did give an extra star because I now feel more compelled to look further into resurfacing than I would have otherwise done.January 2009 - an update: I looked further into resurfacing, and chose to go with this option for my hip. I am very happy with my choice, and strongly urge anyone who needs hip replacement to look at resurfacing. I still would not recommend this book, however."
1,Not really about choices,"As a potential candidate for hip replacement, I was eager to read the book to learn more details about how to compare and contrast the different options. Unfortunately I didn't get this from the book. Instead, it's almost an historical summary of this woman's step-by-step process through surgery. I hoped for so much more."
2,Hip Replacement or Hip Resurfacing:A Story of Choices,"Ok,like another reviewer said I gave it 2 stars as it got me to keep researching.I had my hip resurfaced just under 2 weeks ago.Her book rather underminded and glossed over the recovery,talking about other single hip surgery patients going out site seeing etc.The author had both hips done simultaneously.I went into this optimisticaly and in fairly good shape and fairly young. I wish I had spent the first week of recovery in a coma.This is major orthopedic surgery.I truly recommend the proceedure,but like a full hip replacement it is no walk in the park. (Pun intended)Go for it but with open eyes. Do your research.This proceedure is now FDA approved in the USA,Search Birmingham Hip also FDA approved for a certified surgeon.Best of Luck"
1,"Resurface Sycophants, this is for you!","Interesting, but not balanced. This book was published prior to information on the newer total hip replacement (THR) technologies and prior to the Birmingham Hip Resurfacing (BHR) procedure approval by the FDA for United States. I appreciate her enthusiasm, but the there is not a lot of good information in here; her writing style is painful.For people with hip issues, I strongly suggest that you do a lot of research on the web, talk to your orthopedist and understand the pluses and minuses of both techniques. Resurfacing looks like a great leap forward for people with severe hip problems (arthritis and displacia), but it is no silver bullet."
2,"Feels flimsy but hasn't broken, yet. Not reversible.","I wanted a cheap paper towel holder for our RV. I got what I paid for.This one is made from soft plastic, and when you have a roll on it and give the towels a yank to rip one loose, it flexes a lot. I'm expecting for it to break right off one of these times.Another issue is that there are slots molded on the back side, so if you turn it around to face the other way it's rather unsightly. I actually needed mount these where I'd able to load them from the left. Bad assumption on my part, but it's not clear from the description that it ISN'T reversible."
3,You have to face it right ... only.,"This will only hang one way, with the opening facing right because it's not finished on both sides. (Would have been nice if that had been mentioned in the listing.)This caused us some problems since we wanted to hang it under a cabinet just inches from our fridge. We attached the bracket as far left as possible, then discovered we couldn't attach the main swing-arm unit because it was blocked by the under-cabinet lip. Had to move the mounting bracket (drill more holes) to where it could all come together.Looks so simple ... pretty complicated to mount in areas with limited space.Oh, yeah, it's a swing-arm system ... and when the arm swings, it squeaks. How do you lubricate plastic?"
1,Poor design - very difficult to use,"We bought two of these, installed one, tried it for ten minutes, then uninstalled it and sent it back. Because:- If you mount it on a wall, the swivel design causes the roll to rest against the wall, and every towel you use will have wiped the wall first.- If you mount it under a cabinet it swings freely with no friction, so you need one hand to hold the roll steady and another to tear off a towel.- As others have noted, the open part of the arm must be on the right, because only one side of the holder is finished.Obviously we're in a minority, but for us this design is inferior to the tried-and-true approach in which the roll is gripped from both sides, with just enough friction to allow you to tear off a towel with one hand."
5,Paper Towel Holder,"This is my favorite towel holder, ever. It is white, so it matches the kitchen, and it is simple to put a new roll on... no opening the holder, just slip the new roll on the arm. I love the clean, simple look."
1,Not good,This is complete garbage. You really do get what you pay for. Instead I purchased the Simplehuman Wall Mount paper towel holder and it is really great.
3,ritm puts on the show!!!!!!!!!!!!!,holy shit i saw ritm at its like that with run dmc and ak 1200 that was the dopest rave ive ever been to ritm put on the show no dout keep it real hope ya come back to seattle soon not the greatest album though oh yea donald glaude put the sound in puget sound
2,"oh, baby, this can be much better","Oh, Dave Christopher is the man! But these remixes aren't no good. What's the matter Baby need some inspiration? 'cause I've got it right here, baby. Love you, Carisa."
1,"put out your own music, not these boring remixes!","instead of remixing bad songs, how about putting out good original songs. now if ritm were to release 'deeper' on a cd then i might consider buying it. if you've never heard 'deeper' before then you haven't heard anything worth listening to by them."
3,R.I.T.M. is MUCH better than this,"Im a raver from the Miami area and a big-time R.I.T.M. fan.I have been in raves like the ULTRA beach fest and seen Rabbit in the Moon completly take the crowd to a level of energy which would blow your mind.Dont take this as representation of them.(try Out of Body Experience,or in that case any of Rabbits previous releases) RABBIT IN THE MOOOOOOON,WE LOVE YOOOOOOOO!"
4,Remixes worth getting,Though it's not an album this is nonetheless a much welcomed release from these highly rated electronic producers. A collection of remixes done by the Florida based electronic dance act Rabbit in the Moon of various artists work.A good collection with highlights including the brilliant collaboration with Humate on 'East' and their stunning remix of Orbital's 'Are We Here?'.Any fan of Rabbit in the Moon should have this along with dance music fans who want something a bit different.
3,Rabbit in the Moon are definite house legends!,"Rabbit in the Moon really kick me in the face on a track to track basis, but this album, though good, could've used some improvement. Some of the mixes (the Garbage and White Zombie remixes in particular) seemed very monotonous and not well enough thought out. The best tracks on here are definitely the Sarah McLachlan and Goldie remixes (though their remix of Sarah's 'Possesion' and the 11 minute version of 'Inner City Life' would've been better additions). All in all a fairly good album, and I for one cannot wait until a proper album of theirs is released."
2,I must be the only one.,"I listend to this cd another time and I'm sticking with my original impression, disapointing. The Sara M. remix is pretty good, but the rest I found dismal. RITM is very creative and I appreciated a lot of the beats, but the cd is just to monatanous to be enjoyable. The songs are just to static to keep your attention. In a club this maybe a plus, but in my car, no way."
2,I eXpected far more,"This release isn't that good, sadly enough. It is obvious that RitM have skills via 'East,' which Sasha and John Digweed put into the 2-CD English version of Northern Exposure. Buy that compilation, not this sorry CD; besides the Opium Den version of 'East' only Sara M's 'Fear' is worth listening to."
3,Where did this come from?,"I've been an avid follower of R.I.T.M. for years, and I also love getting a hold of their vinyl, but this cd is a pale representation of what he's capable of. I'm afraid to see what kind of crowd will be at the shows if this is the only cd out."
3,Back to the 80's with S. B. Hawkins,Sophie B Hawkins has had a couple of hits but I must say that was about it. This album contains only two songs that I like and I was surprised that there were not more as those two songs I really did like. It's very 8o's in style which I normally don't mind because I grew up in the 80's but over all I was disappointed with this album.
3,uncomfortable vocal similarities to Michael Jackson,"I'm sure Sophie Hawkins is a very fine lady. I'm sure she has fans all across the world. But I'd never heard of her....had this title come up in my amazon.com recommendations so I sprung for a taste. I'm sorry but she sounds way too much like Michael Jackson, especially in the higher register moments. So, I'll stick with the other newfound amazon.com recommendation-artists that connected with me: Jann Arden, Rachael Yamagata, Amanda Marshall."
4,Damn...,"Sophie B Hawkins, best known for her hit single, ""Damn, I Wish I Was Your Lover,"" (by far her biggest and best hit) has now come out with this, her greatest hits album. Her follow up to her first single was ""As I Lay Me Down,"" with is also a great song.Hawkins has a very unique writing style that many will love. While you may not of heard much from her after ""As I Lay Me Down,"" the rest of the songs on this CD are still quality.A great album for any fan or Sophie or early 90s Pop/Rock. The nostalgia in this CD will surely have you reaching for the repeat button."
4,"""I can only offer myself""","To repay her father's embezzling debt and to prevent her dying father from going to prison during his last few days, Mikayla offers herself as mistress to the man embezzeled: Rafael Velez-Aguilera.She really did not expect him to accept her offer, but he did. Mistress for 15 months. Problem is, she is a virgin.At first Rafael seems a rat for going though with the contract, since he knows her father only embezzled to pay for her mothers medical bills. Her father was caught because he was trying to pay the money back. And now her father is dying and he wants to put her father in jail?As the time goes on though, we not only is he a good lover (hot!), but that a good percent of the time, he takes her needs into consideration. Helping her through difficult times.""Mistress By Contract"" is a good book to curl up with and dream. If you can sleep that is after all the hot scenes (grin)."
3,I thought this one was terrible...,"...but gave it 3 stars for the romantic scenes; otherwise the formula was everything I hate -- wimpy heroine; father-gets-himself-in-trouble-so-heroine-must-sacrifice-herself plot line; unbelieveable dialogues between the hero & heroine. Generally, I like this writer but this book was not a keeper."
5,A Keeper for sure,"This was the second book that I had read from this author and I sure was not disappointed. If you like men that are strong, in control, extremely rich and skillful lovers and women who are sassy, independent but vulnerable you will love this story.Although the two characters get together because of a contract, they quickly become attracted to each other and are a extremely suited couple. I love a story where the feisty woman is pitted against a man who likes having his commands followed without question. I have read book at least 15 times and I always enjoyed myself.The love scences are wonderful too!!!!"
5,Surprisingly enjoyable,"5 Stars for a book of its kind, restricted to a limited format to be part of a seriesWouldn't have imagined myself liking this kind of book, but this was very enjoyable. (On the strength of this, I bought another of hers, much earlier, and it was terrible - - so she must be improving like fine wine.)The characters were fun; they grow and change and develop in very interesting ways. There were times you wish she'd expand or develop a bit more, but the requirements were obviously very exact - to fit the size of this series of books.The situation that get things started is nicely thought out - - not easy to make the principal male into a villain. So the set-up is put in place, and you have sympathy for both the characters. Fun sparks fly, very amusing for reading in planes, waiting rooms, doing laundry, etc. -- above the usual standard."
1,Dishonest and fraudulent practices,I would like to bring your attention to the fraudulent practice of Clever Island (very appropriate name for this company - real clever!). I purchased an item online and a pop-up offering me my so called free gift. It was a free 10-day subscription to Clever Island. I closed the window after I found out it was for children 3-8 years old (my child is 21). I didn't put my credit card number in but my card was charged 69.00 exactly 10 days later. I sent this information to the National Fraud Information Center http://www.fraud.org/
1,Subscribed To Clever Island for Over Two Years-Please Read,"This site was offered to us originally with Time Warner Cable. We subscribed to it for several months for only $5.00 per month. My daughter loved it so much that when we moved to another city that did not offer Time Warner, I searched for Clever Island and finally found out where to subscribe. We kept the service for over two years paying more than $11 per month which was automatically drafted out of our account. It was a very neat program and she loved it, but when she outgrew it, we tried to cancel it. I have left numerous messages on the number they list 1-800-4-clever I think. They never returned my calls. I had to call my bank to stop the automatic drafts. They are still trying to draft our account. No returned calls EVER!!! Beware of this company. Too bad the customer service is so bad because their program is really cool."
5,I LOVE this show,"This show is fabulous - smart, fast-moving, and very entertaining. And the addition of Richard Armitage to the cast only makes it better!The characters are so interesting, and the plotlines of each episode grab you in. You HAVE to see this show!!!"
5,This the best TV series ever!,"After watching the wonderful stories about the British service, it is hard to go back to American TV. This is something you can watch over many times."
4,Season 7 - Richard Armitage speaking Russian - yum,"I've watched several seasons of ""Spooks/MI5"" and have seen so many agents ""go."" I have received my reward, seeing Richard Armitage in Season 7 speaking Russian - sexy."
5,amazing!,Started watching for Richard Armitage and I stayed for the plot. This is a brilliant season and show. I found this episode to be their most intriguing and best thought out. Very interested in the next season now.
4,very good show,loved it...well done stories lines kept you interested can't wait to watch season 8. too bad the ended the show.
5,The best series ever!,"I applaud BBC for it's accuracy and nonprejudiced approach to this very touchy subject of spies, terrorists and politics. You can't get anymore balanced than this. Excellent show and all around perfection. Richard Armitage is amazing once again. I can't wait for season 8 but I think I'll keep myself busy catching up with seasons 1-6."
4,"Works wonders, smells horrible...","I love love love this face lotion. I have problem skin and this stuff just makes me look like my skin is dewey and clean. I use it along with the purity made simple and highly recommend that combination. The only thing is that this lotion has such a bad smell that lingers a while after you apply it (and that is why it gets 4 stars). It has that ""fragrence free"" scent that just is not pleasant. But my skin looks great so I deal with it."
3,Wonderful moisturizer but stinky...,"I loved how this made my face feel. It made it feel soft, absorbed quickly, and didn't leave it feeling greasy. Plus, it's a whipped texture which is amazing! However, I could NOT stand the smell :/ it smells like a wet dog. It would make me sick evertime I would put it on plus, the smell would linger on my hands even after I washed them. This moisutrizer is too expensive to just not use but I just couldn't anymore. That's why I am giving it only 3 stars. I'm taking away a star for the smell and the price. It's a shame too. I really liked this. I hope they change the smell at least to make it beareable and pleasant."
3,Hope in a Jar-- Nice Feel but Horrible Smell!,"I just got a small jar of this as part of a Philosophy holiday kit. I have to say, I like the way it goes on-- not greasy or heavy. Moisturizer usually makes my skin more oily as the day goes on, but I didn't see this with Hope in a Jar. *However*, I don't think I have ever used a beauty product with a stronger smell than this! I put it on my face 7 hours ago and it is still very noticeable... and it is not an ""added fragrance"" smell, it is an unintentional chemical smell. It bums me out because this stuff would be so great if it didn't smell awful! I'm glad I didn't buy a full size jar of this... it seems to work though so I will probably start using it before bed so I don't have to smell it."
2,Not the best value,"I purchased this product from our local MCX for a change from my regular moisturizer, and two months later I'm less than enthused. I experienced no extreme medical issues, like some other unfortunate reviewers, but neither did I experience any sort of positive results. For the amount of money spent, I could have just as easily purchased a moisturizer from a local pharmacy for $5, gone for a nice lunch, and two months later had the same results.""Hope in a Jar"" did not work for me."
2,Smells funny,Smells a little like sour oranges. Difficult to get past the smell on my face. Other qualities of the cream seem fine.
2,BROKE MY FACE OUT,Gave it away...I was truly surprised but this product actually flared up my very light case of Rosacia and I found a better and cheaper face cleaning and moisturizing product at Walmart.
5,"great price, love amazon!","I have been using this product for years. I have very sensitive skin, always breaking out. This product has done wonders for me. And amazon, what an amazing price! Thanks!"
2,There's much better out there,"I started using Philosophy products with their set, called something like Makeup-Free Skin. This was in there, and I used it for a couple of years. It was my first jump up from drug store brands. I liked it well enough, but the lack of spf was kind of a bother, and I never really felt like it sunk in. In the summer, my skin can get kind of oily, so this may be part of it, but even right after washing my face it just wouldn't soak in, so I'd have to wait a while to put any makeup on. I was very conscious that I had moisturizer on my skin. Like I said, though, I used it for about two years, so I didn't think it was bad at the time. Since I've switched to other things, I can't imagine switching back to this."
1,This stuff smells horrid,"I don't like this product at all. It is greasy and smells. There is no hope, but talk in a jar."
2,Very Greasy!!,"This stuff is super greasy, I looked like I soaked my face in oil. It works great on my elbows though."
1,philosphy hope in a jar,This product has some great potential but the smell was so awful I threw it away...what a waste.
2,Smells like hell,"I am all for ""natural"" products... without any unnecessary additives, but philosophy made a mistake on this one. It is almost unbearable to me! It smells so metallic and harsh. Once upon my face, I have to keep smelling it for at least an hour...(Until either the smell wears off or I become accustomed to it)My husband hated it too, especially the smell. And honestly, it was no better than the 5 dollar creams you can buy at any drug store. NOT a miracle lotion... not really anything but hype."
1,Not what I ordered,I have been using Hope in a Jar for a few years now. I decided to order this online because it was a few dollars cheaper than Sephora. What I received is a watered down version of Hope in Jar. It's runny and has almost no scent at all. I happen to love the scent of HIAJ and the light consistency is what I love best. What I got is runny and greasy. I have used it a couple of times and thought I was losing my mind until I read a few other reviews and saw that I'm not the only one. Hopefully I will get a full refund. In the future I will spend the extra few bucks and buy it from Sephora.
5,love it!,"I have used Philosophy's moisturizers for about a year and found that the moisturizer for dry/sensitive skin works best for me. Before trying it, I couldn't seem to find a lotion that stayed with me the whole day, yet didn't feel too oily. This is best for me during the dry winter months when my skin is at it's driest. In the summer I'm ok with the normal skin Hope in a Jar. I also love it's fresh, clean smell."
2,Made my eyes burn,"Hope in a Jar is the product of marketing hype. This product smells like something out of a biologist's lab. It's also faintly yellow, and it reminded me of a chemistry experiment.When I put a huge blob on my cheek (before spreading it out), it left my eyes burning. Its smell and effects on my eyes make it difficult for me to believe in its goodness. At this price, people with sensitive skins are better off experimenting with brands such as Burt's Bees and Shiseido White Lucent (both tried and tested, in summer and winter. they worked)Skintype: Fair Asian, Normal - Dry skin in the US, combination in tropical Singapore"
1,Yuck,Thank goodness I was able to obtain a sample because I would be really upset if I paid for this horrible product.The minute I put it on I noticed the putrid smell. The second thing I noticed was my eyes burning and watering. About 15 minutes later my face was on fire. I had to go wash it off.Purity and Microdelivery seem to be an awesome products.
3,Like the cream but not the smell,"I have heard a lot about the Philosophy products so decided to try this out. The creamy moisturizer goes on smooth and seems perfect for all seasons since it is not too greasy. However, I do agree with other reviewers about the smell. For the price, I think they can work on a better smelling product - this smells a little strange. I had to wash my hands after applying the cream but the smell lingers. I wonder if I will get used to the smell; if not, this is going to be a one-time buy for me. Will post an update in a month!"
1,Worst smell ever,"I usually love Philosophy products, but this product smells so bad it makes me gag. I even tried putting almond extract in the jar, but the wretched smell overpowered even this very strong extract. I will stick with the other Philosophy products in the future."
1,can't get past the smell,"I received a sample of this recently and just put it on my face. As I put it on, I thought it felt nice and went to bed to read but couldn't get past the fact that I just smelled awful. I put my hands up to my face and smoothed my cheeks and then smelled my fingers to see if it was indeed the cream I was smelling and I couldn't believe it. Came online to read reviews and after reading these horrible reviews about people breaking out, I just washed my face and put on my beloved Erno Laszlo cream, which by the way, smells fantastic. This Philosophy cream was beyond awful. In the garbage it went."
2,Not for someone with oily skin,This product is not for someone who has somewhat oily to oily skin. It absorbs quickly. Within an hour I am oily all over.
3,"It's just ""alright""","I'm not a fan of this moisturizer. It has a neat texture, kind of a ""whipped"" feel, but it just didn't do that much for me. It moisturizes okay, but not great. If I put it on flaky skin overnight, it still is flaky in the morning. Yes, it makes my skin feel softer and it's pretty nice, but it doesn't do much more than my Mary Kay or drugstore moisturizers can do. It also smells weird, and the smell lingers for a long time. Some people like this, and I'm a fan of a lot of Philosophy's products, like Purity and the Microdelivery. However, I just don't feel this lotion is worth the price. It doesn't last long, and it doesn't work that great. Maybe it does more for older skin."
1,"God, the smell!",There are no words to describe how nasty the cream smells. I could only stand it for a few seconds before racing to wash it off my face. And then had to douse myself with perfume and talc trying to erase the stench from my memory. *shudder*
2,Caught up in the name,"I bought Hope in a Jar because I needed a moisurizer that was a step above what I can find at the store. I got caught up in the name of this product and it didn't really deliver and neither did the product description. I don't see a difference and I have used the moisturizer daily for almost a month. Also, it has an off-putting ""fishy"" scent which was hard to ignore. I'm glad I only bought the smallest jar. I'm bummed that I didn't get my 3 Sephora samples as promised with my order."
1,face lotion,"this is one of the worst product I have ever used. It didn't have a pleasant smell, and I started to have a breakout. I will never purchase anything from philosophy again."
3,Offensive odor,"I should have taken heed to the others who mentioned the bad odor. It doesn't go away, it stays. As far as the moisturizer part it's ok. Nothing spectacular. I have used other moisturizers that work just as well or better."
2,"Only used a couple times, not that great",Someone gave this to me for Christmas and I only used it a couple of times. Not that impressed with the product. I ended up throwing this away.
4,Great all around,"In the summer months, I use this as my all around, general face moisturizer. It's light and blends well. I use something heavier for the dry winter months. The only issue I have is the smell. Almost fishy. Not a fan but I can overlook it."
1,Philosophy's Hope in a Jar,"I was really excited to try ""Hope in a Jar"" I love trying out new facial moisturizers. I have Combination/Oily skin. So the first time I tried this product out was through a trial size I received as a gift. It works great as far as moisturizing my face. The only thing that I despise about the product is the smell. It seriously smells like a wet dog. I don't like how the smell lingers even after a night's sleep. When I wake up I can still smell it. Honestly this is the only thing that holds me back from purchasing the actual size."
4,Great Product,"I love this moisturizer, I am looking to purchase more of philosophy's product's, I hight recommend, this is my first time using their moisturizer, very impressed."
4,lives up to all the hype,"i had heard so much about this product in various different places that i considered not buying it just because i thought ther was no way it could live up to all the hype, but i was pleasantly suprised. my face feels softer and more plump(in a good,hydrated kind of way)i am very happy with it and will most likely purchase this again"
1,Smells nice but gave me a rash,"I love several of the philosophy fragrances so started trying their skin care line, including ""hope in a jar"" along with a few body lotions. While I do not have sensitive skin, 2 of 3 philosophy moisturizers made me break out in a bumpy rash within 2 days. I thought it was a fluke so months later I tried again with the same result. I've never had this problem with any other skin care products, even cheap drug store ones, so unfortunately will never spend money on philosophy skincare products again!"
1,Hype in a Jar,"EW!! GET IT OFF! GET IT OFF!I was unable to take home samples of the Philosophy products, and let the SA talk me into the $30 set of cleanser/retinol/moisturizer.I had high hopes for Hope in a Jar. But my gawd does this reek! As I'm sitting here typing this review, the occasional whiff of this craptacular moisturizer makes me sorry I didn't wash it off first.This doesn't have any kind of moisturizing feel or glide, it's like I rubbed liquid candles on my face. Stinky liquid candles. My skin feels tight, like there is a mask on it. A mask made out of the same stinky stink of the candles! My face feels very annoyed and irritated, to match the mood this smell is putting me in.If you can get a sample of it first, I'd recommend that. Or at least buy from a vendor with a generous return policy in case it doesn't work for you."
3,Good light moisturizer,"This product is great if you have normal to oily skin. It has a pleasant but light smell, and it feels great when you put it on. For me, I tend to run more dry, so it's not quite enough for me, so I am only giving 3 stars."
1,Watch out who you buy it from!,"I received this item in the mail just fine. However, when I opened the cream for the first time it was a a yellowish off white color and more liquidy. This is an old product especially when I noticed the seal wasn't so new looking either. The facial cream also gave off a weird odor. I went into a Sephora store to double check the actual product and remind myself what it is supposed to look like and the color was a white and a much thicker consistency. I also double checked all their other facial creams and NOTHING looked like what fragrance.net gave me. I returned it!!"
3,OK,This is and OK product. I have used it for 4 weeks. Haven't noticed much line difference. Feel very light and refreshing. Wish it was a more intense working item.
5,Hope for the Hopeless,I have used this moisturizer for the last 10 years and I love it more and more! I use this when I cleanse at night and wake up lovely!
4,product is good but smell is bad,"This product is very moist and comportable, just like icecream, but the smell is not acceptable, when the first time I use it, I really don't want to use it any more. But when I use it the 2nd time, I felt the smell is a little bit better.I heard that the cream for dry skin is better, I will try it next time!"
5,Philosophy is perfect,I love this face lotion it's not to heavy nor too light! This is the perfect size since a little goes a long way
2,I like it but it stinks!,"I wanted to try this moisturizer, I have other products by philosophy and I like to use them. Unfortunately, this moisturizer stinks. The creamy texture feels nice and I think it does hydrate the skin and it is not heavy like other moisturizers, but I can't stand the smell, it is terrible. It would be nice if this cream was non-scented."
2,"Good for really dry skin, but not for normal skin","It really works with my dry skin when weather changes. I usually have a mix to oily skin, kinda sensitive. I used this for less than a month, and it did NO good to my pimples and acne. It's too heavy and it's not natural. If your skin is really dry, it's good. If yours are not REALLY dry, don't use it. I have breakouts on my forehead!"
2,Very disappointed !,"I might have expected too much, after I read some of the reviews and heard Oprah say she has used this product for the last 10 years... I bought the variety for dry (and sensitive) skin. Yet the texture of the ""moisturizer"" is almost like a (white) paste, there's nothing moist(urizing) about it ! It looks like you've spread an almost dry white paste on your skin !!! Looks very unpleasant, and certainly didn't give my skin a good feeling.Furthermore, when I woke up in the morning, the area under my eyes was all swollen - not sure, if I was a bit allergic to the product, or if the the cream is just too ""heavy"", too dry-ish.I'm very disappointed."
2,P U,The first thing I noticed was the smell. It reminds me of vapor rub. Scent was too strong. Not something I was comfortable wearing. Good thing it was a gift.
3,Stinky,"It made my face feel moisturized but it stinks really bad. Like something sour .. and it lingers for a really long time. Besides that , it made my skin feel better. Nothing has changed in looks but it feels aight when you put it on. If you can get pass that smell."
1,Bad reaction,I too bought this product with high expectations. However after a week of use my skin has a horrible red pimple like rash! My T Zone area is actually more dry now then before the product. I will stick with my $5.00 Ponds
5,The best moisturizer,I ran out of this moisturizer and went about 2 weeks using another product. How fast I remembered just how good this felt on my face after using it again the first night. Not greasy at all. Looks and smells so nice.
3,Very small container,"Great product but very expensive. This jar is just about the size of 2 medicine cups. If used daily, probably will only last about s 2 weeks."
1,"Rosy glow, but not in a good way","My daughter gave me her hope in a jar original formula moisturizer because she said it made her face break out. I didn't think much of it because we have different skin types and I have never had a problem with any other product. At least not until now. After using this product for 2 days, my face looks like it has a bad diaper rash. The prouct label claims it will help give your skin a ""healthy rosy glow"". I don't think they were referring to the red, inflamed, bumpy skin I now have. I am using hydrocortisone cream to try to calm my skin, but so far it isn't effective. I have read good things about other philosophy products, but would be very hesitant to try any of them after this experience."
2,Fail,"I really do not like this moisturizer. It's a bit too greasy for my taste, although it does make my skin very soft and smooth. The worst thing about it is the scent, which is really bad. I don't understand why Philosophy can't make this stuff smell better. I do not recommend it at all."
3,Soft and smelly face,"This little jar lasts a long time. I just dab my finger on top to coat the end twice a day. Once before bed and before I put on my make-up in the morning. My face is noticeably softer. I had dry patches on my forehead and cheeks that are gone now (it took about a week and a half).The reason for my three star review is the smell. In the store I thought it was soft and powdery, but once I got it home I realized they were going for a ""fresh"" scent. It's a little sour/alcohol-like. My husband has not noticed the smell and I can't smell it after 2 minutes, but it makes the experience a little unpleasant."
3,It's not great for those dry areas,"The texture is great, and you don't need to use very much of it to cover your face. However, it doesn't smell great (I don't mind it that much), and it doesn't really moisturize my dry areas, especially in the winter. I like when I put on a moisturizer before bed, and wake up in the morning with my face still feeling soft and moisturized. When I put Hope in a Jar on before bed, sometimes I wake up with my dry areas peeling. I do like the texture and think it would be better to use this in the summer, when my skin isn't as dry. I think I'll go back to using my L'Oreal Youth Code Day/Night Cream for times when my skin is drier."
5,best moisturizer ever!,This is by far the best moisturizer I've ever used! My skin is combination and I put this on after I get out of the shower in the morning and it feels fresh and soft all day long! I will never use another one again!
2,Holy hell.. this stuff smells,`I am with a lot of other reviewers on here.. love the product but the smell reminds me of hair dye when you first put it on. I had to wash this off my face and unfortunately had to throw out the produc.
3,Wendy's Opinion,"I was a little disapointed when I tried this cream, I did not expect it to be so thick, I had used Laura Mercier Moisture before so I was expecting a similar or superior product,a few of my friends use philosophy and they are very happy with the results they get."
1,My acne prone skin did not like it,"I heard so much about this product and was excited to try it. I have acne prone skin with mild scarring. I did not like this moisturizer. It broke me out and I did not see any improvement in my skin texture, tone or hyperpigmentation. I will not repurchase."
3,it was just ok,"i thought i would try hope in a jar, well because of all the hype really. oprah likes it, its somewhat pricey so it must be the best, i thought. to be truthful, i have used other products that i think work just as well that i bought at walmart. also, the smell is weird, as some others had alluded to. not horrible, but not so much pleasant either. i bought the .5 oz jar just to try it and used the whole jar, but dont plan to buy any more of it. but really, everyone's skin is different. if you are thinking about buying it, i would recommend buying the small jar and just seeing what you think."
5,Great Book,Linda Blachman has written a really important book for mothers with cancer. Hearing the voices of other women is incredibly important for anyone who has struggled with this disease. This is a unique book that meets an urgent need.
5,An author who knows how to handle darkness,"Linda Blachman has done an amazing job of putting together deeply moving stories of mothers who have cancer. There are so few people in the field who can sit with darkness without trying to making it all better, who sit in unblinking compassion with the pain and unfairness of life.Ms. Blachman was equal to her subject in its profundity, depth, nuances, subtleties. Her voice in the book was the perfect witness to the stories that were told: she framed them, held them, and enhanced them through her comments. She weaved the stories into a meaningful narrative, just as each story itself was a meaningful narrative. All this was done with great insight,sensitivity, generosity of spirit, respect and psychological sophistication."
4,Not your average gumshoe.,"Travis McGee is not your average gumshoe. He doesn't have an office or a secretary. He lives on a houseboat called the Busted Flush which he won in a poker game. He drives an old Rolls Royce that somebody cut in half and turned into a pick-up truck.And the only time he works is when he needs money for his on again, off again retirement. He has a unique philosophy. He wants to remain as anonomous as possible and be retired as much as possible.When he needs money he looks for somebody who has lost something of considerable value and makes them a deal. If he can recover it he gets half it's value. The idea being: Half of something is better than half of nothing. ""Darker than Amber"" is the first book in the series and they only get better and better as they go along. I highly recommend the whole series if you like off-beat characters and unique plots."
4,Relax and learn,"In all my life working with PC , I always find problem occuring from time to time.This book shows me in depth knowledge of how to solve problems I could neverimagine I can. I could, for example, ever fixed 2 hard drives with corrupted DOS boot record and broughtit to life again with nothing lost.I'm not a techie but with an assistance of the book I can do it all.With his relaxed writing style, this book don't make me feel so terrified learning what I have never known.Pick it on your shelf. You'll find it useful when you've got problems with your own PC."
3,Check the back of the book.,"One guy here wrote on July 4 of last year that the cd was unhelpful because it only included lectures. Apparently he did not make it to the back of the book, where the excellent utility cd is located. There are two cd's with the hardcover edition.I agree that the history is interesting and may be helpful in legacy troubleshooting, but one of the most difficult techie things is staying abreast with the new developments. No one can write a paper text that is up to date unless they are using one of the new technology ""smartbooks"" that are self updating. It will be interesting to see if there is a book about repairing smartbooks."
4,A fine piece of work,"Minasi has done it again. This was a treat to read and as in previous editions skillfully walks the reader through the minefield of modern technology. Mark makes it seem easy and reading his work it is. The index is also very thorough which is essential when your on a new project and trying to piece together where you are., For us non techie types its easy to get lost in the middle of a problem. The index helps you find your way back. A great piece of work overall. F.C. Wendell"
2,"Many pages, but more info on ""older stuff"".","We used the book for a course in system support specialist program. The book give a lot of history about the evolution of the parts of the PC. The abundance of information about ""older stuff"" was little bit to long. Information of legacy equipment is not to relevant for today equipment."
2,Overpriced and the info is outdated.,"I just finished reading the book for a computer repair class that I was taking. The book does not talk about the new computers to any degree. I did like the fact that it included a history of computers but thought that the book could have been written in a style that was easier to understand or more exciting to read. I am looking forward to reading ""The Complete Computer Repair Textbook"" by Cheryl Schmidt and comparing it with the Minasi book. The book was highly overpriced at the $60 I had to pay for it."
3,Nice and pleasant to watch,It was cute and my grandkids did watch it.... but not with the enthusiasm they had for the original Annie musical version. We did enjoy it as entertainment.
3,Ashley Johnson made a good Annie!,"It wasn't the best Annie movie but it wasn't awful and Ashley Johnson was a pretty good Annie and quite believable, she didn't look like she was too old for the part to me and I thought she looked like she was around 12. Anyway I think it was supposed to take place a year or two after the first movie so of course making the character a bit older. So really I think Ashley Johnson and the other child actors did a fine job and the guy who played Daddy Warbucks was okay but most of the other adult actors hammed it up way too much and kind of ruined what could have been a great movie!"
2,global star cd/dvd labels,THe program you cant beat its wonderful but beware when you run out of labels(for the disc) you cant get them anymore but if there is a place someone knows about please let me know all in all its good
3,"So cute, but not exactly the vibrant color in the ad","I wanted these when they were on regular price, then the sale price of 65... then found the ""last pair"" when they were on close out for 19 bucks. I got them, and was glad I didn't spend the top dollar at first sight. They are really comfortable, and true to size. They color, however, is not as vibrant or bright in reality as they advertise. They do dress up a pair of jeans, though. And the heel isn't too high. They arrived a bit scuffed, (not worn, but the leather was a bit dry in areas) but I think some polish will do them good. Hey, what do you expect when they're on close out? I still think they were a steal."
5,Not easy to read but so definitely worth it,"If you no background whatsoever on Kazakhstan then it might be a bit difficult to follow all the events. Having said that, Martha Olcott is by far one of the biggest experts on Kazakhstan and if you want to see the opinion of the best then you should give this book a shot."
1,unreadable - next time please use a ghost writer and a story-line,"An unreadable tome! The catchy title promises, but does not deliver. ""What exactly was promised, and why is this (undeclared-) promise unfulfilled?"" Statement after statement is made as if the writer was having a private screening of all events having taken place. But surely the writer means to build a case, or at least make a point?! To no avail, the reader is left wandering through the history and wonders ""what DO you want to say? What IS your point?""Oh, and then the catchy add-on ""Revised Edition""! As if some serious editorial editing took place to make it more palatable! BIG disappointment - only more in-cohesive paragraphs.Having to choose between the Kazakhstan-bought/financed/sponsored authors or this author is easy: ""Leave all of them on the shelf gathering dust."""
3,Nice book but incomplete,"As anyone who is familiar with these compilations know, they are a great read. Unfortunately, this one ends half way through the second generation Miata. They should have waited to make it complete. It is missing the Mazdaspeed Miata (produced in 2004 and 2005); in my opinion, the best of the Miata special editions. This omission is unforgivable.You are better off spending a bit more and getting the Brookland Miata Performance Portfolios for the first and second generation Miatas. They are more complete, varied, and simply a better read. Once you get those, you'll rarely go back to this book."
4,Sakura Infinity Green,"I really like the dishes, however 2 of the bowls arrived broken during the shipment. My only options were to return the whole set for a refund, or keep the set with no refund, paying for the whole set but missing to bowls. I didn't think it is fair, because there weren't any more of the dishes available for a replacement set. I chose to keep the partial set, because I really like them and don't want to give them up. I don't think I should have been charged the full price."
4,"Don't call him ""Fatty""","You will have a hard time putting down this engrossing biography of silent film comedian Roscoe Arbuckle. Author Oderman has interviewed Arbuckle's first wife Minta Durfee extensively for this book. While other Arbuckle biographies may delve into his scandal and trial deeper, this one focuses on his personal life. The book illuminates Arbuckle's heart-breaking childhood, his personal failings and the reasons for the breakup of his marriage."
4,So Far So Good,"I am About halfway through this book but it is well written , informative and definitely holds your attention. I decided to get this book after reading Jerry Stahl's novel"" I ,Fatty"" so I could get more factual info on Roscoe Arbuclkle and this book delivers!!!"
4,Mr Oderman is a great teacher,My wife and I both had Mr Oderman as an english teacher at barringer high school. we have both read this book and it introduced me to a whole new world of comics. It even made me a fatty Arbuckle fan. E.R.Smith & Saaberah Smith
4,Great Navy Adventure,"This is truly a classic tale of heroics, patriotism, adventure, and even romance. It is great. Jack Higgins has done it once again with this novel. I, myself, have only read the Readers Digest condensed novel, but even it was excellent. I have always been looking for a great Navy adventure, I think I have found just that. I would recommend this book to everybody and anybody, because it has something for every one. Carey Reeve is a great main character, and the action scenes are quite suspenseful."
3,Did Not Hold My Attention,"I have always liked this author; I can always count on him for a good story. I was a little disappointed in this effort. Maybe it is because of the high hopes I had after reading some of his other works, but this book just did not hold my attention. He did a good job with an interesting story, one that I think he had to work more on due to it getting away from his standard fair. The characters drive this book and are done well. I guess I was not looking for a sea story and that is what this book is."
3,make belive,"The book emphasizes the humanity and dedication of the Germans who were fighting for the Nazi cause, but omits the horrible consequences for the victims of their aggression. The Germans who fought in WWII did so in support of a regime that chose to invade peaceful countries and then kill, torture and destroy innocent victims. The English and Americans were only defending themselves and saved the world but the book puts them on a par with the Germans. The book's efforts to humanize the Germans and talk about their families and aspirations disregards the evil nature of their acts and the destruction they caused to millions of innocents."

4,Really moves some wood,"If you need to move some wood with your chisels, this is the mallet you need. I do wish the weight was a little better seated in the head of the mallet. Very quiet and easy on the elbow."
4,Excellent Music for the Tai Chi Practitioner,This CD is an excellent companion for the practice of Yoga or Tai Chi. Its delightful melodies would also be a good companion for massage therapy or meditation.
5,Egyptian Tale of Romantic Fantasy,"Gods, goddesses, kings, queens, princess and princes all inhabit this romantic action fantasy; full of intrigue, murder and deceit...a tale full of Obamaesque charlatans and liars versus pure hearted lovers and noble rulers. Virtue triumphs over thick-lipped despots. A great tale."
1,Sorry. I didn't read it.,I did download it. But I didn't read it. So i am morally not fit to review it. yes i am bit lazy on reading !!!!!!!! hope other may find it worth reading
5,"Excellent Read - You Definitely DON""T Get What You Paid For","OK, I have to admit that I was a bit skeptical when I saw this ""free"" book written in the 1800s. I wouldn't exactly characterize myself as a learned reader of literary classics. I had just received my Kindle and figured, what have I got to loose?I was absolutely pulled in by this story and had problems putting it down. It's a captivating mystical love story about an Egyptian princess. This was the first Haggard book that I've ever read and I will definitely download his more famous literary works to read in the future."
3,It's OK,It was okay reading although not exactly my cup of tea. I like reading about other time periods. Became boring at times.
2,Bloated and self-absorbed,"I imagine there are some useful and perhaps even good ideas here. But the entire text is so self-obsessed that it's hard to see beyond the ""travelogue"" conceit. Franzosi seems to believe that his story-telling makes the book accessible - but instead it simply makes it annoying. Can one meaningfully go from words to numbers? No doubt the answer is yes. But the techniques for doing so will be best served by a more concise elaboration written by someone with less interest in sharing his stories with what Franzosi seems to imagine as an adoring readership."
5,Up-to-date complete reference,"This is a complete reference for PalmOS PDAs. The form is a step-by-step walkthrough of each function. Each page is cut in half with text on one side explaining the screenshots on the other side of the page. The chapters go through each function from managing contacts, using the calendar, reading and writing email, to surfing the web and synchronizing with your Mac or Windows box. This is very thorough and up-to-date book for Palm users who like the step-by-step approach that is thick with screenshots."
4,Certainly showed how to use Palm Pilots more extensively,"This book was positioned to get Palm Pilot users to the next level, using the device with their organization's network. There was a lot one could do with their PalmPilot, and I'm sure we all would have been doing those things. But then the device fell out of favor for new technologies, and it happened suddenly."
4,Beautiful peaceful music,A love to put this music on when I need to unwind from a hectic day. It's beautiful peaceful music. To be enjoyed.
5,Another John Saul Great,"As always, John Saul transports you to a different place in a different time. His description of places and events is so real that you can actually feel yourself there. I love all his books."
5,Great service,Great service. The item was in great condition just as described.I've really enjoyed reading this book!
5,Beautiful to watch!,"This intricate and beautiful ancient practice was absolutely fascinating to watch. When looking at the detail of the mandala, it's hard to imagine that it is made with sand. The skill and dedication of the Tibetan monks was captivating."
4,Fostering Friendship,A very good research study on social problem solving envolving children. I used this in my dissertation.
5,Edgy pop songs,"If you like the Foo Fighters, Replacements, Bad Examples, Dramarama and Smithereens then this is the album for you. Its not ""Joshua Tree"" material by any means but this album is full of well-crafted pop songs that maintain a rock basis. After a few listens, you'll be hooked. This is a CD that you can listen to from start to finish."
2,don't last,These batteries have not lasted as long as the original NiCad batteries they replace. My drill has very little torque or duration even immediately after charging.
4,Nice Improvement,I have recently used the new batteries and without a doubt see the improvement in performance. I use them mostly with my cordless drill and just like others have mentioned the batteries and charger do not fit in the drills case. I modified my plastic case by cutting the battery area a little larger and can now fit both batteries in the case(no battery on drill). I store the charger separately. I retired my new Hatchet saw because it never had enough power with the 18v nicads. I tried the new batteries on the Hatchet and the tool is brought back to life. The lights on the battery to show charge level is nice and functions well. I may purchase more of these if I catch them on sale. Four stars only because they don't fit in the case.
3,li-on only ok,im a residential electrician who uses milwaukee exclusivly.li-on batteries dont work below 32 degrees.(not good).i still buy the old ni-cad batteries for this reason also some times u get good ni-cads that last a couple years.right now i have 10 different 18 volt batteries and rely on the ni-cads.
3,to new for real review,"Just received these today so actual test for usage will come later. However a couple things are obvious;1. You cannot use ANY of your standard 18v chargers, in case you wondered.2. These will only go on the Ni-Cad tools in 1 direction, will not reverse. So you lose that ability.3. The charge indicator, works while charging, does not work on my standard 18 v NiCad tools, however the battery seems to work fine.I will let you know after a little usage how these hold up in a work environment. Also, FYI the 1st time you try to mount battery to charger may take a little work as the seem to fit extremely tight. First coupla times they did not seat properly and I got flashing lights, but after 2-3 tries it finally seated and all seems fine."
2,Li ion batteries are very disappointing,"I keep my combo tools in my truck. I can charge the batteries fully and leave them in my truck overnight. The next day, I check the charge lights before putting them in the tools and four lights appear. I start using them and they die almost immediately. The ni cads never had a problem. I have used this combo kit for six years and love the tools but the new batteries are very frustrating."
1,"Milwaukee abandoned the customer, sad","Are you joking me? These same batteries were at one time, just over 100 dollars, on this very site. And in three years, they have almost TRIPLED IN PRICE. Miliwaukee used to be a cut above the rest, quality, sturdy, dependable tools. I have owned the 18 volt set for almost 10 years. The initial batteries stunk, and I had to buy replacements, same ni-cad junk. They did give me years of use, but lived in the charger, thankfully I had 4 of them to keep my going. Now they are all dead, and I wish I had bought this set back in the days when it was reasonable. Now, you are better off buying a new tool combo kit, and with a different company. It appears that Miliwaukee has abandoned their loyal customers, and don't care one second about it.Go to dewault, or any brand that is not completely fleecing the customers with over-priced batteries, almost forcing you to buy new tools.They have won, I will buy new tools, NEVER MILIWAUKEE AGAIN."
1,Such a disappointment,"As a beginning, female mountaineer, battling some of the same addictions as Ms. Chisolm, I expected this book to be an inspiration. Instead, it was a great disappointment. Besides being POORLY written, I shudder to think of any other man or woman using Margo as a role model of recovery or mountaineering. After reading her book, I was actually disuaded for sometime from climbing as I saw her complete failure to find any balance in life. I saw no success or victory in her story - only confusion, isolation and self-centeredness.I have NO idea why Margo wants to climb - she sounds utterly miserable on every voyage. Sounds more like her journey is to feed her ego, not her soul."
1,poor little rich girl trading addictions,"This book clearly reveals the self-narcissism of the author as she uses her trust fund to subsidize her great ""adventure."" It would be more interesting if she focused on climbing and the journey into health instead of her journey in trading addictions--climbing for eating disorders."
2,Tale of personal struggle that happens to contain mountains.,Your enjoyment of this book depends on your expectation. I read it expecting a story about mountain climbs and backcountry experiences with a backdrop of a woman's struggle to overcome drugs and eating disorders. What I read was a book about a woman's struggle to overcome drugs and eating disorders that happened to have some mountain climbing info in it. This book is not for the serious climber looking for an inspirational book about mountains. The author spends so much time in self-diagnosis and criticism that the mountaineering pieces fade into the background.
2,whiney rich girl trades addictions,"as a substance abuse counselor I shudder to think of readers believing that this woman is moving into health through her self absorbed journey into ""accomplishment."" It is clear that she had traded addictions and needs to look seriously about parading her narcissistic 'adventures' as growth."
4,Live Performance Very Good,I have not heard the album.I heard the group live a couple of weeks ago. Very enjoyable and varied program (within the range of their music). Album appears to offer the same variety.
4,Water barometer,"Nice looking barometer with the white oak, colored water and glass. I was expecting a little more movement of the water on changes in pressure though. Otherwise I like it and would recommend it. You have to get use to it's position because their are no graduation marks for pressure. Great conversation piece."
3,Post-Modern Hoo-Hah,"Being a huge Post-Modern fan, I thought Barthelme would exercise a little more of a central narrative to keep this book from spinning off into a nexus of half-consciousness, character self-reflexivity and general alienation. I did find that the true impetus of the book is in Snow White's hair which proves to be a driving erotic (if broken) symbol for the other characters in the book. The bold printed authoritive text has some nice gleamings of wisdom that remind me of the moral messages of fables, but sometimes seem too obtuse in their lack of connecting tissue between the episodic chapters of the book. I am going to read ""The Dead Father"" so my brain jury is still out on Barthelme's writing being up my alley."
4,Uh,"Honestly, and I know many will have problems with this sort of thinking, most of the reviewers on this page are obviously just too stupid to understand this novel or enjoy it."
3,Biz is a vet in the game but still hot as hell!,"Even though this album comes a while after All Samples Cleared (also great!), it and biz himself are splendid. at the time of it's release this material surpassed a lot of the other songs in the game at the time (around 2003 I think)."
3,Good to go back once in a while,"This disc is pretty good, fun to take you back to when hip-hop wasn't so um...well, hip-hop is sort of a mess right now (with a few exceptions) and this goes back to when people concentrated a bit more on simple, yet effective beats with some lyrics you could actually decipher. Given, Biz was never really known for being a supreme lyricist, but he always had you entertained if nothing else.There are a lot of good tracks on this disc, but it loses a few stars on the ranking scale because of the samples in the middle of the cd. I'm not sure why you would lace those samples on tracks and then put the tracks one after another on the disc, makes for a good portion to skip.Anyway, still enjoyable and nice to see him back."
3,Nice but really complicated to assemble...and I'm no assembly nerd!,"This buffet is nice once it is assembled. However, I ended up having to pay someone to assemble the doggone thing. That cost me extra! The assembler was a professional and was noticebly frustrated with all of the many, many, many pieces."
4,Good value.,It was the perfect size and style. I thought it was fairly easy to put together - good instructions if you are handy. The only thing kind of disappointing is the finish on the wood stained top. It is not smooth at all. I refinish furniture and will need to do some work on the top to get it smooth and shiny. Overall it is very nice for the price and I had looked for a piece for a long time for this space.
5,Great Film From An Up and Coming Director,I saw Eastern College at a special screening in Chicago and really loved it. The film is a hilariously poignant; if you've ever stayed up until 4:00 am doing whip-its or passed out in an empty kiddie pool then you will surely agree. It's not a callow slacker movie of the Apatow variety though. It's directed with a sense of confidence and maturity and definitely earns artistic merit. James Francis Flynn is definitely a director in the independent film world to keep your eye on.
5,Something Lighting!,"I loved this story. Ms Poarch has a beautiful writing style. The story line for the book was great. The characters Clarice and Tylan are really made for each other. Neither one knows it but each shows the other things that they never thought they wanted in life, until they happen to meet each other. Much love to Ms Poarch. Try out her other books, she has a couple of books that are connected that I know you will enjoy!"
2,Standard coax cable...,Useful to connect auxiliaries to your TV or to split your cable to another TV. Product would be better if it had the push-on connectors instead of the screw-on connectors.
5,Guided tour down the Noble Eightfold Path,"Ayya Khema, who personified Theravada Buddhism in her meditative practice and compassionate life, leads you as if by hand to the isle of inner peace. Warmth and practicality permeate this book, which is more a teaching than a tour guide. Ayya Khema reveals important insights in such a way that you hardly notice you've been taken well down the Noble Eightfold Path. You arrive at the end of the journey ready to believe her final assertion: ""There is no reason why an intelligent, healthy, committed person should not be able to attain [mindfulness] with patience and perseverance."" Add this to your list of desert island readings."
5,SCARE DEM IS SO HOT,"SCARE DEM CREW JUST GOT IT GOING ON. ELEPHANT MAN WAS DOING FABULOS ON THE SINGLE WITH HARRY TODDLER ENTITLED ""HOT GAL"""
4,the greatest work done by scare dem crew..,outstanding there will never be anyother crew audio that's better..
5,Great series,I remember watching it on the Disney Channelback in the early 90s.It was on a show called Lunch Boxwhich had animated presentations of story booksand then I later bought two VHS tapes of it.It's about time they put the entire show on DVD.I agree with Darth's review.Even adults love it.And so do I.
4,Makes me so happy,Everyone who loves Totoro loves the cat bus. This toy is very cute and it is of really fine Japanese quality. I gave it four stars because it is smaller than I thought it would be (not their fault). It is about the size of a small loaf of bread. My advice - get the bigger one.
2,Wrong Cate Bus!!,"I ordered it for my wife who loves the movie Totoro and we were both excited to receive the scary yet cool cat bus. But the cat bus we received was a cheaper, poorly made knockoff."
5,Love it!,Great gift for child who love the move Totoro. The cat brings the story to life for our childrens enjoyment.
5,Love the CATBUS,"We love this CatBus! If you are a fan of ""My Neighbor Totoro"" then you will love this toy. It is way cute and soft. We placed it on our collectibles shelf so we could see its smile all day long!"
3,picture is misleading,"when I received my shipment I thought I WAS SENT THE WRONG ITEM BECAUSE IT WAS IN A DIFFERENT LOOKING CONTAINER FROM THE ONLINE PICTURE AND THE NAME ON THE CONTAINER ELIMINATED ""O2 ORIGINALS"" ALSO ON THE PACKAGE I RECEIVED IT HAS THAT IT IS ""CONDITIONING SERUM"" AND NOT ""SOOTHING POLISH"" AS IN THE PICTURE. I USED TO USE THIS PRODUCT YEARS AGO WHEN IT STILL CAME IN THE SAME PACKAGE AS THIS PICTURE SHOWS AND I THOUGHT IT HAD BEEN DISCONTINUED. SO WHEN I RECEIVED THIS ITEM IN A DIFFERENT PACKAGE I WAS SURE I HAD BEEN SENT THE WRONG ITEM, HOWEVER I EMAILED THE COMPANY THAT AMAZON ORDERED IT THROUGH AND I WAS ASSURED IT WAS THE CORRECT PRODUCT JUST WITH NEW PACKAGING. OTHER THAN ALL OF THIS CONFUSION I DO LIKE THIS PRODUCT.[ASIN:B000BW76LS Scruples Soothing Polish Conditioning Serum]Scruples O2 ORIGINALS Soothing Polish 3.4 oz]"
1,Incredibly Disappointing!,"I've used Scruples 02 Originals Soothing Polish for years and have always just loved it! It's fantastic and lasts for such a long time! So, when my last bottle finally ran out, I saw this ad and ordered a few more! Unfortuantely-it appears as though the manufacturer has decided to chanage the product and it is now in new packaging and not nearly as thick and nice-in fact, it's runny and greasy and feels awful in your hair. To make matters worse, the advertisement on Amazon and from the store where it came from has the picture of the old product but when I ordered it, the new product came. I have tried to contact them numerous times but no answer and no call-backs. Thankfully I made the purchase on AMEX who is now fighting with them for the refund! What a nightmare! Stay away from this company! One of those bad experiences to be avoided! Susan"
3,Needs improvements,"The material is excellent but it needs more size options. It does the job that it was designed to do and that is holding utensils that disabled people couldn't use without a lot of difficulty. The shipping in outrageous, more alternate shipping like ground delivery, please."
3,"These are OK, but not my favorite....","I purchased these for $25, which was full price. Now they are much less.I prefer the slacks hangers that have the foam coating, since they are less likely to make a crease in the pants."
5,Great hangers!,"These are the best pants hangers!! We now exclusively use them. Pants do not slip off, and the hangers have a slim profile, so you can fit more into your closet than with other hangers."
4,Great product!,Really like the quality of these hangers....they won't allow a crease in slacks which is exactly what I wanted when ordered.
4,Great Hangars,"Up until I purchased this product, I was using a similar product that had 4 bars on a single hangar. I purchased these hangars because it allows my work clothes to hang individually of each other. My previous hangars would always cause the outer pants to cover the inner ones and cause creases in them. They would also sometimes shed on the inner pants due to the design of the hangars.My only complaint with these hangars is that when placing the pants on the bar the hangar tries to run away every time. It a minor nuisance but overall I am very satisfied with this product and if you don't already have something similar, GET IT."
4,Handy hangers,"I love these hangers and have pretty much replaced all my old ones with these. They are space-efficient, and make the closet look very neat.They are easy to hang and easy to remove items, especially from higher closets. You do have to be careful to get the pants on squarely so they do not slip off."
2,Not the real Reno,The video is not very informative and it obmitted a lot of events and functions that make Reno a fun place to visit. More of a quick glance at what Reno/Tahoe has to offer. It did not show the neighborhoods or the people of Reno.
3,Not a bad start.,"I quite like this book. There's a picture for each of the recipes, fifty odd of them. There are however some problems which prevent the book from being really useful.The recipes are quite short, a page or less each. There's not much in the way of hints and tips, meaning that trial and error is required with some dishes. But I've still no idea firm my ""white dumplings"" really should be. I'm learning to make some assumptions, due to the instructions brevity, such as ""cook for three minutes"" means ""cook for three minutes over a medium heat"".I bought this book because I liked the concept, but a book three times this size is needed to do the subject justice."
4,Breaking stereotypes in a great story,"My son has two mommies. I wanted story books where he could see another child with two mommies. But I didn't want the story to be about 'having two mommies'. This is a quirky little story about a dragon with hurt tail - that goes to the doctor's office. The Doctor is a woman, the nurse is a man (which was a surprise to my-then-three year old). He still likes the story. I would highly recommend this book to anyone trying to teach acceptance to young people."
3,"Acceptable, but room for improvement.","Overall the writing style is generally easy to follow, but there are many confusing passages (where a new concept may be introduced with no real effort to explain it.) At times the author gives the impression that he expects the reader to know absolutely nothing about viruses but virtually everything else about biology and biochemistry. Undergraduates will likely find it confusing at times, while graduates will likely crave something deeper."
5,good,"The product was in good shape. It was delivered at the right time. I am satisfied with everything. As about the book, I have mixed opinion. Not the best around. But I did not have a choice since it is the text book."
1,I expected more,"I have not listened to these songs for years.After listening, I was not too excited."
1,Hair and wigs for the stage,"The photos are remedial and the contents are not appropriate for anyone past high school or community theatre. I teach on the University level and this book was of NO use to me in a teaching environment. I think that it is a book that is good for enjoying different styles and looking at techniques, but it is not up to the standard of other books on the same subject."
1,Home Office Suite by Activision,"I don't like it. It is hard to download, and then to open up. I don't know if I got a bad kit or what but it just doesn't do the job well and it isn't user friendly.I'd be better off sticking with Works.Wish I could get my money back. I bought it at Staples."
1,problems,I also had problems getting the mailing list portion to open. I went to the web site and was still unable to fix the problem. I dont think it is xp friendly
2,not durable,I've had this cable for about a year and it worked fine for the most part. Then the tip of one of the connectors came off and now its not much good. Looking at the part that comes off and where it connects and it does not look like a very durable joint so I'm not likely to buy another one of these.
2,Poor design,"I bought this cable to connect my laptop to my receiver, but the design is terrible. When the jack is placed all the way in the headphone port on my computer there is no sound whatsoever. I have to fiddle with the cable to get any sound to come out. When the sound is available it's poor quality and doesn't come through all my speakers. Try another cable."
3,Who fans - don't bother.,"The Who had a fantastic string of hit singles from 1965 to 1969 in the U.K. This documentary interviews music critics, fans, even Shel Talmy (who produced ""I Can't Explain"" and the ""My Generation"" album to discuss the era.Unfortunately, no one from the Who is involved in this project. It is not an offical Who product. But the biggest disappointment in this video is there is not a single video clip of The Who performing any of these singles in their entirety. Every video clip on this DVD has either been shown on ""The Kids Are Alright"", ""30 Years Of Maximum R&B;"" or ""Who's Better, Who's Best"" in their complete forms. If you are interested in starting a Who video collection, start with one of those titles. If you're a Who fan, don't bother with this one."
3,Flashes of vintage Deford,"Frank Defors is arguably one of the most gifted sports writers and commentators of our times. He is able to stand back and see the big picture. this compilation of Deford's NPR spots and columns spans a wide array of sports and sports figures. I think he is best when he profiles the people in sports. There are pieces on Pete Rose, Bobby Knight, Bill Russell, Keith VanHorn and those we may not know as well. What I like best is his obvious affection for and knowledge of the history of sports. The pieces in this book ars short enough that you can skip the ones which don't grab you immediately. His outlook is wry and affectionate. Some of these pieces are Deford at his best. The majority are merely good."
5,He has done better,"While this book is good, i don't think it displays the very best of Frank Deford. I first became acquainted with Frank Deford's writing when I read his book Alex: The Life of a Child. This book is among the best books I have ever read, reverberating not only with personal honesty and passion but written with all the love of a father for the daughter he is losing. There doesn't seem to be a false note anywhere in this book. I have re-read this book many, many times.It was this book which motivated me to read every book and column of Deford's I could get my hands on. Some of his best sports pieces are indeed in the book but it is an uneven mix.Writing the way he does "" at the top of his game"" is a gift, an art, and reading his words often leaves me feeling transfixed, enlightened and emotionally moved. I just wish the book ad been edited to truly include the best writing."
1,DeFord is grating,"Athletes are a strange breed. Most of them ruin their lives over sports, because they don't realize their minds offer them other ways to engage the world. Imagine then, the 'frustrated athlete,' who never had a chance to go professional, and instead wants to spend the rest of his life talking, and talking and talking about sports. Worse still is Frank Deford, the most prissy, irritating east-coaster who fits in that category; every over-mannered word that comes out of his mouth is excruciating. He just loves to find exagerrated, cosmic meaning in the tossing around of balls. When he comes on NPR I cannot reach the off button quickly enough. One wouldn't think this would provide a viable career, but there he is."
1,"Stale, Trite, Miasmic mess","One of the more boring and ill-thought out books I have read this decade. Deford is somewhat of a moron, yet thinks he is the gift to planet earth. I would not recommend reading this at all. I can't believe I gobbled it up at a used book store."
3,Textbook for Introduction to Women's Studies Course,"I used this textbook for an introduction to Women's Studies Course. It's a good textbook but each article or writing piece varies which can be taxing when you have a certain amount of readings to finish for a specific time. Anyways this was a core component of the women's studies course. But it's well done, representing several perspectives from various cultures."
3,way to much highlighting,The book has tons and tons of highlighting and a lot of written remarks all over it! I can hardly focus on the reading because almost everything is highlighted or underlined.
1,Needed more............,dAmn what's the deal we'll there is none.... if U are a fan of Pat you already have these songs and if you're not than U probably wouldn't buy it anyway he just don't write no more he's has smoked himself stupid and can no longer deliver on a consistent basis next album will probably be in 2010............. dAmn .............what a waist of talent...hah ha smOking will ruin your life GLAD I stopped..........
5,Beautiful,"The book has gorgeous photography, and is so very true to what I experienced on the Island. A wonderful keepsake of a fabulous vacation."
5,Extremely thought-provoking!,"Once again, Torey Hayden has yanked my heart from side to side! Venus, the seven year old in this story, is an amazingly brave soul. Just as Sheila was a ""fighter"" and ""survivor"" in Hayden's book, ONE CHILD, little Venus shows the same strength and courage in the face of what most of the world would consider insurmountable odds, although not necessarily in the same ways.This book stirred me in a most peculiar way. I always have a desire to ""help"" after I read Hayden's books, but this book dug even deeper into my heart. I guess there are some things in this world that the majority of us will just never be able to understand at all.I can tell already that I will be wondering for years, unless a sequel is written to answer my questions, what happened to Venus."
5,Slightly different voice - same wonderful storytelling,"Torey Hayden again tells the story of one of her special education classrooms. Again she is able to nearly hypnotize the reader, rendering them unable to put down the book. Again she knows how to use the perfect mixture of humor and pain to create a story told from truth.The only difference between this book and her others is the fact that there has been a large time gap between the writing of them. Torey has changed is some way concerning the way she writes, which makes the whole reading experience a little more exciting and special.Read this book - you won't regret doing so."
2,a lack of....,"Although Beautiful Child is helpful to educators, as I reader, I felt disappointed with the final text. Quite simply, it's all bone and no poetry. More shockingly--Torey seems capable of much more than this--she seems to waste space. Certain pages, for example, detail repetitious dialogue. ... This is what I paid hardcover price for?In her first books, Torey Hayden showed a certain passion that is simply absent from her current release. I felt she was simply stuck in a rut, churning out another book for a well-established fan base, and not really challenging her own artistic aptitudes (which, in One Child, were so prevalent).I still think Torey Hayden is an exceptional person, as many special educators and those in the humanities are, but I felt really let down this time. If you want a good read, I discourage anyone from picking this one up. If you want information, this is great. Just don't expect anything too moving or emotional."
5,Excellent Read,"Torey Hayden has come through again! This book is touching, funny, and inspiring. It is a can't put down book. When you purchase it, be ready to be awake reading it all night!!!"
4,Beautiful Story Despite Circumstances,"This is the story of Venus,who is deprived of food, clothes,soap and bathing.Her developmentally delayed older sisterbrings her to school in a sporatic system.However,the sister appears protective and loving within herability.Despite these enormous problems that take placein a special ed. program,Torey jumps right in to work herspecial magic with this child.I love all Torey's books and like to re-read them.In thisbook,what was lacking,was the method Torey has of havinga little taste of her own life paralleling the story.For this reason, it seemed a little cold.Maybe, Torey is married now and reluctant to rehash thepast.Part of the humaness is lost because of thisstyle of writing."
2,Maybe just me.,"One of my least favorite of Torey Hayden's books. It was long, slow, and frustrating! I've heard others who loved it though, so maybe I just felt frustrated by the ""lack of positive results."""
4,"Torey, you still have heart...","I just finished this book. It was very good. I have read every one of Torey L. Hayden's books and they are all excellent. Torey has got the heart and patience of a saint, with the honesty of a child. I will say that while this was definately not my favorite, it was still good reading. It did start out a little slow. About halfway through the book it began to speed up and I couldn't put it down from then on. I would defiantely reccomend this book to anyone though."
4,The views of a Butland,"I wanted to first say that Charles Butland is not only an entrepeneur and now author, he is first and foremost my uncle. He sent me the soft cover version of his book and then just recently the hard cover when it went to final copy. He called me the other day to tell me that I could see the rating for his book at Amazon.com.I have read through the book and found it funny and thought provoking. Most of the things are just distant memories that come bouncing back after seeing them in print. I loved walking down memory lane, and am proud to be associated with the man who wrote this fine book.Debbie (Butland) Bernier"
5,Something for everyone!(Especially the entrepreneur),"Down to earth, and very real... ""Charlie's Thoughts"" had me seriously reflecting on life one moment and laughing out loud the next. He touches on life, love, relationships, childhood and business. And while there really is something for everyone, entrepreneurs will find some of Charlie's stories especially humorous and inspirational. There are anecdotes of wisdom sprinkled throughout the book and I'm sure, like me, you'll pick a handful that will stay with you for the rest of your life. (And what a cool idea! The book comes with a music CD!)"
5,Bruce Rux really makes you *want* to believe.,"This book is excellent reading. Although confusing at times because of the many names of abductees, government officials and experts, I could not put this book down.Being a skeptic, I had a hard time believing a lot of what he wrote, but Rux has packed his book full with proof.It is certainly an interesting read, and eye-opening on the subject of UFO sightings and abductions. It is a little disappointing that he puts so much weight on the ""face on mars"" and the ""pyramids on mars"", since neither has been photographed up close, and are impossible to verify.In any case, I thought this book was great, and will pass it on to as many friends as I can."
5,Mr. Rux has likely solved the mystery behind UFOs.,"As a long-time student of the UFO phenomenon, as well as investigator & researcher, I was deeply impressed with this work. The premise of the author, made with starling clarity, logic and rock-solid research, ties together,finally ,all of the disparate elements of the enigma; everything from the ""nuts & bolts"" view, to inter/extra dimensional; from the various types of ""aliens"" described, to abductions, cattle mutilations, crop circles, Vallee's ""control system"" and Keel's ""cosmic tricksters""; from disinformation and coverups to duplicitous ""ufologists""; from the anomalies of Mars and the Moon to the origins of religions and mythologies. This book will be hard to take by the ""true believers"" (of an alien presence), but will most likely be cited in the future as the definitive answer to the UFO mystery."
2,Goofey,"Not bad but a little goofey at times. Some of his stuff isn't original at all and looks to be drawn from Alan Alford, Grahame Hancock and Atlantis Flemath. But its okay if you can bear the long winded chapters."
5,Love it!,Exactly what I needed for the new babies room and closet. Arrived right on time and was a very reasonable price!!
5,Works in baby's closet,Wifey did some research and these seemed to be priced best and were most functional. They come with labels as well but we are using them just as dividers for sorting purposes.
2,do not fit,"I dont know what kind of crazy closet bar we have, I know it is new and was purchased at a hardware store...and these do not fit. I really like that too =/"
5,Great product!,These small dividers are so helpful an they go from newborn to 8 but nice part is it also comes with extra stickers so you can actually use them for longer you just write what sz you wanna use them for great price an fast delivery!
5,Useful and helps with organizing!,I'm glad I made this purchase. Seems like something so small but this really helps with organizing my baby's clothes. Sort of gives me a timeline on when to start using the clothes and putting the smaller ones away. This would make a really cute baby shower gift as well. Would definitely recommend it!!
3,May not fit all closet racks,I ordered this product to help us get organized and ready for our baby's arrival. Sadly it doesn't fit my closet rack so I will have to figure something else out.
4,Pretty handy,"I liked the idea of being able to organize my son's clothes by age group, when they are that small they all look like the same size on the rack. my only wish is that the opening was a little larger, they are just barely able to fit on our closet rack"
4,Helpful,Helpful for organizing baby clothes and very easy to get on the closet rod. The only thing I don't like about it is that the stickers for labeling clothes sizes don't include 0-3 months.
4,LOVE these!!!,"These make keeping my daughter's closet organized a cinch! It also makes it so my fiance can find clothes that will fit her so he can get her dressed easily, and also so he can help put laundry away, yet not mess up my system! The only downside of them is we don't have much space between the rod and the shelf above the rod in the closet so they don't quite fit. They have to go on the rod at an angle rather than the size tab be right on top. This doesn't really bother me though as it makes seeing the size easier, in my opinion. Definitely worth the few dollars they cost! Everyone keeps asking me where I got them and how they wish they had some for their child's closet. We have so many baby clothes in so many sizes that it's nice to keep it all organized and know which article of clothing is which size to easily grab what fits her now. :-)"
5,LOVE IT!!!,"I didn't use these for my baby, I used it for a closet that is shared by 3 children. It has made it much easier using the tabs with their names on it, for them to keep their clothes separate from each other. Wonderful idea!"
2,Would have been nice,But these don't fit over older style wooden closet rods. I can get them on there but they're bent slightly and won't move. Probably better for nonhistoric homes.
2,Not what I was looking for,"It did describe depression well. My husband has it and I have found after 4 years of marriage, he can't make a decision. If I ask him to make a decision, we end up in a argument. So now instead of asking where he wants to go out for dinner, I just tell him where we will go and when. Works great for us. Also my sis has a depressed person as a friend and she says that is the same with him, just tell him and don't give him choices. Since it took me 4 years to find this out, I thought maybe this book would have more suggestions that would apply to my situation but it didn't. However it might apply to a lot of depressed persons--just not my husband."
5,Very Good,"This book is very helpful to people who interact with people who suffer from depression. Speaking as someone who has struggled with depression for years, it contains information and advice I didn't even think of and I would find helpful. It's not very technical and it's short and simple, but it is a great gift for someone who wants to help but doesn't know how."
5,"Gregg L. Friedman MD, Psychiatrist, Hallandale Beach, FL","Talking to Depression is a great book for anyone who is dealing with chronic depression. The book is well written and easy to understand. It covers the different treatment options for Major Depressive Disorder. By Gregg L. Friedman MD, Psychiatrist, Hallandale Beach, FL"
1,Can't record voice!,"This player says it's a recorder but after we got it, discovered that when we pushed record and talked into it, there was nothing on the tape! Turns out that it can only record from the radio -- there's no microphone hole! We are returning it for a refund, which is too bad because Amazon doesn't have many other small, low-priced, radio/cassette machines."
1,A piece of junk - deserves 0 stars.,I got this because the black model had a couple of favorable reviews. From now on I only trust the negative ones. RCA should never have made this & Amazon should not be selling it. Caveat emptor!
3,On the fence,"What I could read of the story was great. Not sure if it was an abbreviated version, but I felt like something was missing. I didnt feel as though I downloaded the entire book and some things were missed."
3,The Yellow Wallpaper,"Very odd. Unless you know about the authors background of postpartum depression, this short story is quite odd. Once you obtain the schema, this is a deep and sad story."
4,Creepy little short story,"This is a creepy little story about a woman that seems to be suffering from post-partum depression. This was, of course, not recognized as an illness in the time period the story was written, so her husband and brother, both physicians, thought the best thing for her was to be locked away in a room alone to rest for a few weeks. The room has a hideous, peeling, yellow, patterned wallpaper that she can't help but focus on as it aids her descent into madness.This was great as far as short stories go! It was very interesting and very creepy. I think it's a story I will remember for a long time."
4,A classic meant to be reread as an adult,"As many, I first read ""The Yellow Wallpaper"" in high school. Back then, I was intrigued by the story, and felt empathy towards the main character, but felt myself struggling more between an unfamiliar dialect and of course an impending test.Now that I am an adult, I decided to reread it, and found it fascinating. It is quite short, but contains incredible symbolism: we feel sorry for this woman, apparently a new mother suffering from severe post-partum depression, banned from doing something therapeutic: writing.J.R. Reardonauthor, ""Confidential Communications"""
3,It's okay,"The inner workings of someone who is obsessed with the yellow wallpaper. Good, but I could have lived without it."
2,Describes The Life of a 19th Century Woman: BORING,"While I appreciate that the author is likening the life of a 19th century woman to that of horrendous wallpaper I just found the story to be monotonous. Like wallpaper, a woman of her time was expected to be seen and not heard. Expected to look and act a certain way and if she didn't then there must have been something wrong with her. (So it was assumed... just like she imagines something is not quite right with the wallpaper.) But the tone of the story is definitely one of a woman off her rocker; a monotonous, frantic pace. I can't say that I thought it was a fantastic read and I probably would not tell anyone I know that they should read it. Two stars for just ok."
2,Ok short story,I was angry that the woman allowed her husband treat her like an invalid. Speak up woman and be strong. You allowed him to keep you weak.
4,"Very interesting ,makes a good fast read",An interesting story that was unimaginable makes a good fast read. the ending was almost twisted yet amusing in a way.
3,Pretty Similar to What is Expected,"Since the story is so short, the book is obviously going to be very thin. One thing to keep in mind, since this is a budget edition, it really isn't made to the highest quality. There is no title on the spine (since there isn't much of one) so if you had this on your shelf you would not be able to see what it is. Also, the yellow artwork on the front is very grainy (similar to if one were to stretch a photo very wide on an at home computer). These comments, obviously, do not pertain to the content of the book, so if it is simply the story you want, then this is a good buy."
2,The yellow wallpaper,Hard to follow. Psychological in nature. Set back in the early 19 hundreds. Not sure about the end. Didn't understand.
3,Much like Wallpaper,"The Yellow Wallpaper wasn't quite what I was expecting. What I was expecting, I don't quite know, but it was thought-provoking in many ways."
1,Do not purchase this copy,"My daughter asked for a copy of this book for Christmas. It looks like a manuscript with small print and no pictures. While my daughter is a teen, we were both very disappointed in the format."
2,Very disturbing book...,"I found this book was extremely disturbing and though alot of people liked the book, I thought it was pretty insignificant in the women's rights/feminism department.Not that great."
1,Did the author even know what she was doing?,"This was another book I had to read in women's writing. If I was teaching the class, I would not have included this. If you have read my review on Chopin's ""The Awakening,"" you will recall that I did not feel it was a really good piece of writing. But AT LEAST Chopin had a good idea. And AT LEAST Chopin put forward a good effort! The protagonist here does not really score a victory for the evolution of female protagonists. Nor is she memorable. In my opinion, she comes off as someone who is not mentally well. If you want to read a book that deals with the many pains women are subject to, read Edith Wharton's ""The House of Mirth."" If you want to see a female character who represents an important change in the use of female protagonists, read Charlotte Bronte's ""Jane Eyre."" If you are so determined to read this flop by Gilman, well, at least it is only 30 pages."
4,feminist horror,"The author drew largely on her own experience to write this gripping and harrowing tale of a woman sinking into madness despite (and in the author's opinion, partly because of) the efforts of her husband and doctor to help her get better. There's no violence or gore: the whole action is in the woman's mind as we witness the deterioration of her condition. Beautifully written and eerily scary."
3,How the other half lives,"Any red-blooded American alpha males who sufferedacademic ""forced exposure"" to this delightful littletale should seek out the short story ""A Piece OfLinoleum"" by Dr. David H. Keller, M.D. Reading itwill put you right again."
3,The Yellow Wallpaper Review,"The book is a classic. Yet, you need a certain taste for certain types of knowledge. Such as women and gender studies. As well as you certainly need to enjoy reading professional opinions."
3,"A little creepy, but what happened?","It was short, it took about 3 hours, fast paced, but I'll have to reread it because I just didn't get it in the end. Was the lady crazy to begin with or did her husband drive her crazy? Was it post partpartum depression or was she really part of the wallpaper? I guess we'll never know."
4,Suffragette-Style Feminism Still Ringing True,"The Yellow Wallpaper is a pinnacle of feminist literature, though most contemporary feminists wouldn't think so. This is the feminism of our great-grandmothers, suffragette-style.Charlotte Perkins Gilman explores independence, spiritual and mental wellbeing, and empowerment within the confines of early-20th century through this collection of short stories originally written for her feminist newspaper. She cunningly explores women's relationships with children, men, and other women in very accessible stories that nearly everyone can relate with on some level.These are stories of women doing it on their own and doing it well. Don't be spooked by the first story, but keep on reading and find yourself looking at women's empowerment from a whole new angle.Best of all, the Dover Thrift Edition costs only $1.50!"
3,"Cute, dim and I wish it flickered.","This is a cute nightlight but it is not very bright and it doesn't flicker like the tree candles made by the same company. It also has no light sensor, so it stays on all the time."
4,Santa suit,I have found that the three quarter length suits are very popular for family visits and for photo studios the past couple of years.
5,We've used it for almost 40 years,"We received three of these for our wedding back in 1969. We only kept one and should have kept all of them because we've used the book constantly and the one we kept is very ratty by now. The recipes are perfect for a couple of any age - delicious, easy, and make use of simple ingredients."
4,Wonderful Cookbook,"After having given my original ""Dinner for Two"" cookbook to my daughter when she got married, I started missing some of the really easy & simple receipes from this cookbook. Great to have found another copy in such good condition. Thank you."
3,Betty Crocker's Dinner for Two Cookbook,"I was not thrilled with the book's condition. I thought, from reading the condition described, it would be in better shape. However, I decided not to send it back, so I kept it. I didn't want the hassle."
1,Opportunity Slips,I did not like this book at all! Could not get into it no matter how I tried. Just not the book for me.
4,"Not I, but Christ","Any thing about Corrie Ten Boom is good as far as I am concerned, but this book givesyou not only nice pictures it tells you about what she is doing. although It is more like a documentry thanthe other books I have read."
3,this is not the book you need...,"ok, maybe i was a little bit harsh with the title... but i got disapointed when i realized that his book was not for me.i live outside the US, and i trade european stocks... IBD -his newspaper- is for no use to me...he should have explained how he calculates his stuff on his newspaper... but, if you wanna use his method... buy his book...this is called advertizing, isnt it?i was not able to really try his method, i think it is the same for many readers...up to you!"
1,Don't buy it,"It has no fundamentals, nothing that can help you, only a so called method that's garbage."
1,This book is for kids,"This book is garbage. My feeling is that it is full of common senses in a stock market! Nothing really useful to be a successful trader. Don't waste your money, like I did."
5,"The GREATEST,MOST VALUABLE,INFORMATIVE book written","Mr.William O'Neil has written the most informative,understandable,able to follow book on stock market investing ever written.Through his incredible God given genius he has helped many thousands of people become better investors and secure a better life for themselves and their loved ones.Buy the book,read it,study it, practice and build confidence and profit.Thank you Mr.O'Neil for all you've contributed to the sucessful investor."
2,Not for Value Investors,"William J. O'Neil begins his book ""How to Make Money in Stocks"" by describing the characteristic a company should have to be considered a growth stock. These characteristics include such things as current quarterly earnings per share, annual earnings increases, new products, new management, new highs, leader or laggard, institutional sponsorship, and market direction. Although some of the points he makes in these first few chapters are interesting and noteworthy, I feel that he goes overboard in the later chapters with trying to time the market based on technical analysis. This book is certainly not for value investors."
2,Weak book,"This is a bubble gum type of book that does not teach anything about making money on the markets. It is a platform to sell Investor Business Daily services. If you want to learn trading look for articles written by Toby Crabel or Arthur Merrill, even Linda Raschke. They are full time professional money managers that happend to write few articles... some of them you can probably find on Ebay for cheaper...."
2,The book does not measure up to how professional traders trade,"This book is really basic and it will help you get an understanding on how to buy and sell stocks. However, advanced or even mid-level subjects are not covered at all. Trading is not that simple. Don't let anybody fool you. So you need to study and learn from traders like Ed Seykota, Linda Raschke, Toby Crabel. These are professional traders. Check on EBAY if there is anything for sale from them. Buy it. Study them. They dont have time to write books because trading is their job. So yes, this book is ok primer, then move on to study the real traders"
3,Other books to consider,"O'Neil's book is a well-written, clear and succinct guide for momentum investors. He recommends that you buy stocks with positive earnings surprises and strong technical fundamentals. If you're attracted to the momentum investing approach, but want a more thorough and broader discussion of this investing style (including application of the style globally), then look also at ""The Hedge Fund Edge"" by Mark Boucher.The key problem with books like this is that they ignore the factor that statistically accounts for most performance: asset allocation. They encourage you to focus on stock picking rather than diversification; and the momentum style discourages you from rebalancing your portfolio when sectors get overheated. To put this book in that perspective, look at the material on sites like ABetterWayToInvest and ETFResources."
3,One of the best book in stocks!,"Pros:* I know nothing about the stock market until I read this book.* Very well explain on how to tackle the market during good times or bad.* Even you know nothing about stock, you can have better understanding on this industry once you have read this book.Cons:* This book is good for gaining more knowledge but does not provide any plan or action that we need to take in order to succeed in this business. Overall, it is still ok."
5,great book,This was the first investing book I ever read. And since then it still reamins to be one of the best. This book is ideal for all investors. I do not suggest it for trading or day trading though.
5,Best fundamental book analysis,"At the top with, Benjamin Graham's The Intelligent Investor. Great Great read."
4,a good read for beginners,"It is easy to read and understand. O'Neil's strategy in picking stocks is supper simple. It is easy to follow his strategy, although there is no garantee that it will make you win money."
3,His suggested system is a good starting point.,"This book leaves me with mixed feelings. The initial sections on CANSLIM are straightforward and make a fair amount of sense. However the technical analysis sections of the book are marred by a great deal of vagueness. For example, he shows pages and pages of charts, but often the suggested pattern is hard to see, or is ambiguous. He suggests different types of indicators like cup and handle, but doesn't mention simple ones like moving averages. Worst of all, rigour is limited. More explanations of relationships to the underlying economics or market would be appreciated."
4,"works, but you need the right kind of market","CANSLIM works, but you must have a momentum market to get the best results. In choppy or down markets, this strategy leaves a lot to be desired. For that type of market, see ""How Markets Really Work."""
3,Not for the beginner....,I was pretty confused by the charts and some of the concepts presented cos I'm a beginner. I also found that the book relied on the use of WON's IBD which is not applicable to companies outside the US....
2,A plug for IBD...,"I bought this book after I heard about the CAN SLIM method. This is the acronym of traits that O'Neil looks for in picking stocks. I'd say only 15% of the book is good, relevant information. And even less if you haven't read other books and are knowledgable of the lingo. The rest of the book is an advertisment for his Investors' Business Daily publication.I've learned alot more from other authors such as Tom and David Gardner and their Motley Fool collection."
2,not that good.very confusing,"I dont think that you will make a lot of money in his way.He is distant, doesnt explain cearly all his methods..He makes a lot of publicity of HIS ""investor daily publication"", and the more you read, the more you get confused.After reading a couple of good investing books by famous writers, I get more confused with his book ( cup with handle patern,can slim program, bla bla bla, ..)It doesnt follow any fundamental at all,and his cocepts are way outdated.I don't consider myself a novice, but really this book makes me fell like a jerk ,dont explain well,and didnt help me a ALL"
1,One of the worst investing books ever,"When I bought this book, I 'hoped' that it will help me invest better. Turns out, it's an entire ad for IBD and CANSLIM (more like CANSCAM). This book was probably the most useless book I've ever read. Why? Because he constantly talks about EPS and why it's the king of the stock market. Reality is, just because a company has a good EPS, or even a good percent increase in EPS, DOES NOT make it a good stock to buy!! And he drills the opposite into our heads with this book. I read the first 50 pages, and knew that this book was trash. At least I can return it and get my money back so I can invest it in a better book."
3,If his system is so successful...,"...then why is he telling you about it in this book, and not out there making money in the markets? Questions aside, O'Neil outlines the system he uses to select stocks in a very accessible, easy-to-understand manner. Like any system, it has its strengths and weaknesses and should not be viewed as a guaranteed ticket to instant wealth.If you are new to stock analysis, this book will give you an introduction to what makes stock prices go up (and down). I liked it because it was interesting to see what system he used and what kind of success he had with it. I have no problems recommending this book but it shouldn't be the only book on investing that you read."
1,Conflict of interests,"I have to agree with the reviewer equityanalyst, this book is garbage. Of course I am not surprised that the book continues to be a good seller since the average investor thinks that he is above average, and with a little guidance will beat the market. Guess what you won't. Technical analysis presupposes momentum in the market, which there isn't. Anybody that still believes technical analysis will make them rich, also believes in the January Effect, Hemline Effect and can even possibly predict bull and bear markets by studying weather patterns. Do yourself a favour don't waste your time or money looking for the investment ""holy grail"", educate yourself on efficient markets and investor psychology, and stop pouring money into this author's undeserving pocket, his interest is merely revenue maximisation, not your wealth creation."
5,How To Make Money In Stocks,"Anyone wanting to learn ALL about investing the RIGHT way NEEDS this book. If an ole country chicken farm boy can turn a 1000.00 30 times over in less than 21 months, anyone can do it. This is the ONLY book you need."
5,A must read for all investors!!!,By far one of the best written and easy to understand bookon investing. Mr. O'Neal has taken the myth out of consistantwinning on Wall Street. His approach is a far cry from thatof the main stream think on Wall Street. An absolute mustread
3,Not Bad,"This book has some common-sense strategies that any beginning investor should start with. His main focus is to remain emotionally detached and to set a limit where you sell even if you love the stock. That is a great piece of wisdom.The reason for 3 and not 4 stars on this book is that he heavily plugs his website as an added reference and doesn't hook us up with any math to back up some of his analysis. Still, this is a book that most investors would want in their bookshelf."
5,Infoormative Stock Market Knowledge,"Of all the books out there this is one of the best. It's poorly organized but the info is right on the money. Bill tells us how the market really works and this info should be part of every High School curriculum. Sadly, it is taught almost nowhere. For a well rounded overview also study Darvas' first book, ""How I Made 2 Million Dollars in the Stock Market"". You won't be sorry! Both books are somewhat dated but the fundamentals are there. Period!!!"
4,Great reading.,"Great book, full of information. Well studied strategies. Easy to understand - although a couple sections make take two readings."
5,This book changed my life.,"After consistently losing money in the markets for several years, I stumbled across this book. I have since retired from my profession at age 32, and now live a very comfortable and mentally satisfying life trading stocks. I would recommend this book to anyone serious about learning to trade stocks. Thank you so much Bill O'neil!"
2,Outdated,"This book was written before current day's market volatility. His number one lesson, cutting losses at 8%, is impractical in today's market. There are possibly a few good insights here and there, but it's mostly an advertisement for Investor's Business Daily...paid for by you (if you buy the book)!"
2,The author talks about,"cutting your losses at 5-7% down after 2 or three weeks of owning the stock. Geez, nowadays a stock can go down 5% in matter of hours, and be down 20% in a week.Second, the section on reading charts is confusing at best.Third, the book is seriously outdated in many ways."
1,Not good investment strategy,"The author's CAN-SLIM investment strategy has several shortcomings, the main one being that it involves market-timing. I do not believe that a person following the strategies in this book will attain satisfactory long-term returns in the stock market. The charts presented in the chapter on technical analysis do not represent the cup-and-handle patterns which he claims represent superior buying opportunities. They are very vague. The practice of concentrating a portfolio in small-cap stocks, and using a -7% stop loss is a good way to generate a 7% loss in your investments on an ongoing basis. On the positive side: his discussion of evaluating earnings reports is useful. Every investor should know how to read an earnings release, and evaluate a comany's balance and income statements."
1,Not a good book if your just learning.,"This was the first investment book I bought a few years back. The fundamental sections, regarding earnings growth is OK. The technical analysis sections are extremley un-clear, and poorly written. For example, he often talks about bases and recommends not buying a stock that is 5% above its base. The problem is he never really defines what constitutes a base. There are many more similar problems, and I promise that you will end up doing a lot of assuming. By the time you are done reading this book, you will have more questions than answers. Not a good way to build up confidence. If you are new to investing, you would be much better off buying a Motley Fool, book. If you are not new, and have already read several other books, I doubt you'll take anything worthwhile from this one."
5,Excellent book for getting started in stocks trading,"I haven't finished read, but so far it is a pretty good book for getting started in stocks trading, you will learn many basics and get several advised on what to do or not. Starting to learn how to read charts and which stocks to pick."
3,Lacks depth,"This book gives excellent common sense advice. Advice that many thought unnecessary in the 90's, but which has become very relevant during the past few years. One shortcomng of this book is that is does not show the reader how to use options to make his/her investments even safer. After absorbing the author's suggestions, read THE SHORT BOOK ON OPTIONS to find out how reduce the risk of stock ownership, yet still remain profitable."
1,Pandering for Investment money,"It is a sorry state of affairs when an investment guru panders you to buy his paper, the Investors Business Daily, instead of giving helpful advice as the title suggests. His circuitous and devious route will probably make him more money than he will investing in the stock market. His advice may have been the greatest thing since sliced bread in previous years but the rules are changing!"
3,Lost money following the patterns,"This book covers the fundamental analysis, but I found that the stock patterns(cup, cup with handles, double bottoms) described in this book is very difficult to understand. The times I tried to invest money when the stock broke out of base, I lost money. I don't know if Mr. O'Neal is just lucky. Don't trust the patterns described in this book."
2,OK,Decent book. Time could be better spent by finding an online article on CANSLIM. Far too much IBD (Investors Business Daily) promotion. If you're planning on subscribing to IBD I suppose with would serve as a good instruction manual with some old examples.
3,CAN SLIM - same as most diets,"The techniques suggested in the book are theoretically sound but like all security recommendations, once they are put into practice you realize that they are among the biggest frauds perpetrated on the American public."
2,Aging mix of basic conservatism,"To be fair, I've only skimmed this book, but I don't like things told to me in absolute terms, there are valid exceptions to most rules. For example the author insists it's a mistake to hold a fund less than 10 years, and he cursely dismisses day trading altogether. So far my impression of the book is 'sluggishly traditional', 'anti-innovative' and annoyingly conservative. Some of the basic ideas may have merit, but there's too much blasting of valid techniques, like selling short. I guess some allowance could be made for it being written some time ago, but I don't know how much."
4,Overall a well written book,"Overall a well written book with a sound fundamental strategy. I have only 2 criticisms. The cups and saucers pattern was not well explained, and there are excessive references and plugs for his newspaper. Nonetheless, this book is a great value, very readable and his strategy is sound."
5,Down to earth and successful,"William J. O'Neill writes this book in an absolutely arrogant and conceived way. But as Andrè Kostolany (a stock market expert widely known in Europe) says, in the stock market you have to be arrogant to and totally sure of your oppinion, because if you get affected by the oppionion of the mass, you lose. Given his success, and his astounding methods William J. O'Neill has every right to be arrogant. His system works and will work. Absolutely recommendable."
3,Not as cool as I thought they would be...,These socks didn't actually keep my feet cool during my hike... I picked up a pair of wool socks from another manufacturer that did the job so much better and actually fit my feet more snugly. These were a bit of a waste. I do not recommend this sock.
1,Review for Kindle Edition.,"The Kindle edition is broken. The text is abnormally large and absurdly formatted, which is genuinely distracting. Also, there is no access to the table of contents, why? Who knows? I have wasted about $3 on this, please do not do the same. I for one will be converting back to paper."
5,The great British poet laureate of the Victorian age,"This little book is a good and inexpensive introduction to Tennyson, who was every Victorian lady's favorite. From a purely technical level, he was absolutely ingenious, perhaps the best poet of Victorian times. His poems were also easy to remember and recite aloud. For example, ""The Lady of Shalott."" Give this poem a try and you'll see what I mean.David Rehakauthor of ""Poems From My Bleeding Heart"""

5,pleasure to meet you,"i haven't read the other reviews for this live album, but i'll wager that most of the other listeners have a history with King Crimson. well, this was the first time i listened to an entire album of theirs, and i was not only NOT disappointed, i felt that i got much more than i bargained for. since then, i've 'regressed' in a since, listening to their earlier work and finding out what the studio versions sound like. but Absent Lovers is like that first true love, the one who all the rest are competing against, unwittingly and ultimately in vain. one or both of these discs are almost always in rotation in my stereo."

4,Uplifting and inspiring,"'Brave Faith' is the CD I listen to most often for the time being. I find much inspiration in the texts, especially the song 'Increase my Faith'. The first time I heard it, I knew I had to order the set of twin CDs. It matches my feelings exactly - my theme song, so to speak.Thank you, Jana Stanfield!Maryanne RyggNorway"
3,Does the job. Hard to put on.,"This is like playing twister to get this thing on. The strong velcro does not help when it gets tangled either.Does help to support my shoulders and I use it when I will be at the keyboard for a while. Gets rid of some of the shoulder pain afterwards so worth the cost.It is tight around the belly (I have a ""gut"")."
1,very poor---Do not recommend,I get back spasms sometimes in my upper back and good support will most timeshelp them to get better. This product was not easy to get on and it has much too muchflexibility to provide much of any support to the back area. It is like wrapping an acebandage around you! You are better off to buy a good posture bra that hooks in the frontif you are a woman!
3,Mixed Feelings,"I don't think I've never read another book like this, so I'm not sure how to describe it. Very slow paced, not a lot of character development. Not a lot of explanation about where everyone went, I just didn't think enough how and why questions were answered early on. Interesting, but I really found it easy to put down. I also found some of the main character Ish's point of view about non-whites curious, yet somewhat disturbing. As if that was the way people viewed each other in the late 40s, and quite obvious lack of communication/knowledge about each other. There are some very interesting plot twists in here, none of them gory where they could be. Seems as if Stewart withheld gruesome details to focus on Ish's response to a completely changed world (no complaints here). I just find this book hard to recommend, but I wouldn't discourage anyone from reading this either."
5,Best apocalyptic novel,"I have read and reread this novel many times over the years, and this was just one of many copies I have bought to share with friends. It is the easiest reading but most thought provoking apocalyptic novel I have ever had the pleasure of reading."
3,"Worth reading, but disappointing","Considering all the raves, I was disappointed by Earth Abides. Although the premise was interesting, it never really went any place and kind of left me hanging. I thought the discussion of how man's departure from Earth affected other species was thought provoking and well done, but the rather dry writing style and lack of depth in the characters left me underwhelmed."
2,Depressing.,"I read this for a geography class in college. Boy, what a downer. Think Little House on the Prairie meets Mad Max, it's that skewed and contorted. Moments of trying to rebuild are perpetually dashed. In truth, what we have here is the story of a man trying to recreate the past, and how a world gone wrong prevents him from achieving his dream. He is in essence, powerless to do anything about it for the forces against him are nature itself.I do not recommend this book unless you like to read about characters who have no hope whatsoever. I think the one plus is that it's set in the San Francisco Bay Area, so there's a kind of tangibleness to it from this reader.Beyond that, I should've trashed or donated this thing ages ago."
1,"Book Great, Kindle Edition Sloppy","This is one of the great books of the 20th Century. Unfortunately, a poor job was done producing it for Kindle. It seems to me that the print edition was scanned using Optical Character Recognition software and not proofed. It is full of misspellings and incorrect words due to the software limitations. If Amazon expects us to pay for this, they should make some effort to be sure that their product is correct!"
3,Survivalist Sci Fi,"The story of a world decimated by a fast-moving plague, Earth Abides follows the life of Isherwood, a 29-year-old loner who, while camping, suffers a rattlesnake bite that saves his life. After recovering from the snakebite (and other symptoms), he makes his way back to the San Francisco Bay area, where he finds his parents gone and the city deserted. Indeed, only a few people remain after the scourge that killed millions.Written in 1949, Earth Abides is a philosophical sci fi classic--it takes place before rock and roll, before microwaves, and way before computers. As Ish bands together with a few survivors to found a new civilization, he must decide what is important to keep from the Old Times, and what can be abandoned. The charm of Earth Abides is that it is as much a portrait of the mid-20th century as it is a futuristic fiction. It is the story of the last Americans."
3,The end of the world as we know it,"I read this book about 35 years ago as a paperback and just decided to read it again as a Kindle edition. I liked it much more when I read it as a teen, now in my 50's it seemed kind of slow. It's not one of those books you read over and over again."
3,Early for the genre,"If seen only as an example of early writing in this genre - mankind after the apocalypse - this should be taken as an acceptable novel as compared to later attempts in the same vein. The characters don't really develop and just seem to stumble along without learning how to cope beyond what they knew ""before"", which makes for a somewhat plodding read."
5,Grandfather to all the post-apocolyptic literature of today.,"Read this book when you're really depressed. You will realize that things are not all that bad. Earth Abides provides hope. Even if everything we hold dear, everything we assume to be permanent, everything human disappears, the dream will survive.This is not the metaphysical good v. evil crap of Stephen King, nor the bang-bang rootin' shootin' end of the world of the pulps, but a quiet look at what the world would be like if mankind silently slipped away."
4,never to be forgotten,"This book has been torpedoed by some readers because it isn't ""The Stand."" While ""the Stand,"" is one of my favorite books, what happens after the world is wiped out by plague becomes highly supernatural. Much as I like that, Stewart shows a much more realistic side of what would happen to whatever few survivors this world might have if a plague took most of us out of circulation. Any possible community would be small, and battle dogs, ants, rats, diseases, and the like. The characters here are never to be forgotten--Ish, Em, Joey and Charlie above all, and the plot stays with you long after the book is finished. I read it in the '80s when I worked on a book assembly line. Imagine my delight that it is now available again. This is up there with ""Alas Babylon,"" and just a bit less depressing than ""On the Beach."""
3,"Decent, Interesting, but nothing spectacular.","I just finished this book, and I have to say it was interesting but nothing really special. I read The Stand many years ago, and loved it, although it was extremely unrealistic. Earth Abides has the realism, but it overdoes realism, without too much excitement. Basically if you have some time and want a quick read, pick this novel up, but if you are looking for a spectacular sci-fi or post apocolyptic book you are better off picking up another novel."
1,"Tedious, tedious, tedious","The book held great promise in the first few dozen pages... a believable plague and a believable reason for the protagonist to have survived. It goes rapidly downhill from there. The lead character, Ish, is pompous, self-absorbed, grating, and oh so very tedious. Even giving credit to the fact that the book was written in 1949, there are some very basic errors. Canned goods don't remain safe after 20 years, nor does gasoline remain usable. I kept reading hoping that the book would go somewhere, but it really never did. If you must download this book to your Kindle, do yourself a favor and pull down the sample. Read it, enjoy it, and move on. There's NOTHING more there. If you persist, don't say that I didn't warn you."
2,"I ""Ish"" I hadn't bothered to read this book","2 stars for the ""human"" emotional experience but the book lacked excitement and was mostly dull and depressing. The year of the rats, grasshoppers, etc. How original - not. The only thing the people did was marry more than one wife and breed. No one learned from ""George"" on how to keep the plumbing and houses in good order. No formal schools were set up so everyone learned to read so civilization could rebuild itself. They talked and made plans but never followed though.Ironic their small group refused to breed with a pretty but dim witted female because they didn't want dim witted children yet in terms of learning, each successive generation became dumber anyway. The author must like caveman because his little ""tribe"" is rapidly devolving into that era."
2,"Clever science, weak literature","Many of the rave reviews for Stewart's post-apocalyptic novel are by readers who first read it many years ago. After prodding from a trusted reader-friend, I read it last month for the first time. Our hero, Ish, is uninspiring, and the other characters are wooden. Although the premise is a clever one, and many of the events that occur are unexpected and therefore interesting, it's difficult to get caught up in this story of mankind's fate after a disease wipes out most of humanity.Everything in the novel occurs within one man's lifespan, and it is therefore not surprising that Stewart exaggerates character traits so that mankind will swiftly evolve. But the characters are so unenlightened - Ish is the only one interested in teaching children to read, and he gives up after a while - that it's hard to take seriously Ish's assurance (to himself?) that these are average Americans.In short, an interesting concept but flawed in the execution."
2,Dull,"I know this is considered a classic, but, in my opinion, it does not pass the test of time. None of the characters, including the narrator, Ish, is engaging, and the passivity of the survivors is hard to accept. I don't need zombies to make PA fiction exciting, but reading about survivors who basically just live as if nothing has changed, happy to eat canned food is dull and depressing."
1,This book is insulting,"It's been awhile since I read this book, but what I remember about this book is that it insults you and basically says that if you haven't gone to college and grad school that you cannot be intelligent or sire intelligent children. The author writes this book about the one truly intellegent person left alive. He portrays the rest of the survivors, who are average non-college educated, blue collar types, as little more than simpletons. The main character and the author doesn't even try to have the survivors learn to use the left over technology to help better their situation because they are too dumb. When they reproduce only Ish sires an intellegent child. The rest of the chilren are all dumb like their parents. Bah, that's it. My hatred for this book is off my chest. I don't reccommend it."
2,Boredom Abides,"I love post-apocalypse fiction, but I can't figure out why everyone likes this one. The first 1/3rd of the book is great, as the main character experiences what becomes of his world after everyone else dies. Then it's as if the last half of the book was written by a female. It's mostly introspective, about how the character feels, and nothing really happens. If you want a page turner from front to back, read 'Alas Babylon','One Second After', or 'Without Warning'. I would donate this book to my local library, but I would feel guilty knowing some poor guy might pick this up and waste as much time on it as I did."
1,Boring and poorly written,"I was very disappointed in this book. It was slow, boring, filled with uninteresting characters, and the writing was extremely stilted. And I couldn't suspend my disbelief enough to accept that automobiles would still operate after sitting around with gasoline in their tanks for thirty years. I skimmed through most of the book hoping something interesting would happen, but I was utterly dissappointed. There are better books in this genre, don't waste your time with this one."
5,Read it 3 times over 20 yrs. All time favorite. Timeless.,"Facinating concept. It's far ahead of it's time. Written in 1949 it could easily be updated to any time. It must have caused quite the controversy when originally published. Each time I've read it, I've found something new. A perfect book for discussion groups"
3,A Moving Story,"I had great expectations when I started this book and got out of it slightly unsatisfied. The book shows pretty well what civilisation is about and how much it is fragile. Also how much civilisation relies on a few individuals only. All the lost knowledge in the library no one can understand remains as a vivid image in my mind.In spite of some theories underlaying the story being already out of date, that book poses essential issues and the empathy we develop for Ish in his efforts and trials to answer them and maintain some civilisation makes the story moving."
3,"OK, of its type","If you like post-apocalyptic sci-fi, as I do, you'll probably enjoy this book. The book starts out strongly but peters out toward the middle after the narrator settles down and becomes embarrassingly introspective about how himself and what it takes to build a civilization. Parts of the book are clumsily written and pretentious. If you want better apocalyptic fiction, try John Wyndham or John Christopher."
1,Worst Apocolyptic Novel I've ever read...,"This book sucks. Cars don't run on 20 year old gas, canned goods go bad after time, You should probably learn how to grow your own food and get your own water before 20 years has passed... This book is not only dated, but just plain stupid in it's aspects of survivalism."
1,"Long and drawn out - this may be a classic, but it was extremely boring to me","First, let me start off stating that I know this is suppose to be a classic; however, I found little to like in this book. It is a very, very long story where nothing happens...really. After a couple hundred pages I started to skip forward, looking for something to peak my interest. Nothing ever happens in this book...let me sum it up for you. 1) Plague, 2) a few people find one another, 3) they plant plants, 4) they plant more plants, 5) they watch the ants and rats die out, 6) they have kids and scribble on a rock for 20 years, the end.If you want to read a great post-apocalypse book, get One Second After or The Road. Either of these books blows this dull piece out of the water."
3,Where are the Generators?,I liked the book but all the characters were technologically ignorant. Even in the forties they had small portable generators but this was ignored in the book. One part of the book basically said they let all the lights go out. People knew about generators then and if not you would've have soon found out.
1,Would have given it a Zero if the computer would let me,"I have been a fan of PA fiction for over 30 years. My first PA novel was the children's novel ""Beyond the Dark River"" by Monica Hughes - a novel which I read when I was eleven. It hooked me on PA fiction and ever since then I have been trying to find as many novels or movies that I could get my hands on.I had read good things about Earth Abides online and was looking forward to reading it. Can I say how disappointed I was? Perhaps it was the era in which it was written, but all I could think of throughout the book is that the new civilization would have been much better off without the pompous a$$ of the main character Ish. ""They thought of me as a God."" Good grief!If I could have rated this movie a zero I would have. Take this one out of the library if you must, you'll be glad that you didn't waste your money on it."
2,Stilted and Clunky Writing,"Even if Stephen King did base THE STAND on this book, he takes the idea of a world-wide plague and develops it much better than Stewart. I understand that EARTH ABIDES was written in the forties, but the stilted style of writing used and the attitudes and world view of Stewart's main characters are so jarringly anchronistic that I could never forget I was reading a book --- it never transported me into the world that the writer was trying to create. The italized asides within the chapter explaining what was happening elsewhere (i.e., lice, cats, ants, etc.) were interesting but not enough to save the book as a whole. LUCIFER'S HAMMER, WAR DAY, or THE STAND are all much better ""end of the world"" type books"
4,Well done!!!,"Earth Abides is well worth the read. It is difficult for me to suggest precisely why that is so, thus very little actually happens through the course of the book.I suppose there may lay its charm. It's simplicity seems to add plausibility. My impression is that there was much more hype than the title deserved, nevertheless, it certainly deserves some."
5,Earth Abides,Very well written and interesting plot. Kept reader wondering what was next. Could not put the book down. I have it on my e-reader and will read again
3,Not a fan,"I've read a lot of Science Fiction in the past 35 years and found this just ok. I guess I didn't get the underlying message. There was little action, little adventure and basically a bunch of slackers degenerating back into the middle ages. The main character Ish was an odd duck that I could not relate to. I guess I just don't get it."
3,monotony,I felt that this book is very monotonous in how the main character of the book travels around the country looking for people and answers to what happen to the world. he will go in to extreme detail in minor occurrences like seeing something like a body or a hammer. i think this book is very good and has a good plot and deep thesis but i wouldnt recommend this book because it is a slow pace dragging book.
3,A classic but dated...,"I realize this is a 'classic' of science fiction, but I couldn't find it in me to really love it. It''s good, but sooo dated in many respects. And frankly, I never really connected with Ish, the main character. Still I am glad I read it, because of its enduring status."
5,"I also found this spellbinding, decades ago","I read Earth Abides in the sixties as a teenager, and it is one of the few books that stays with me through the years. A beautiful, haunting book."
5,An Enduring Classic,"I first read this book when I was in high school. That would be early '60s. It was one of those stories that was foundational in my own thinking. It was a pleasure to read it again after all these years. It is one of the earliest of the apocalyptic genre and its themes are timeless and the characters unforgettable, as you yourself Ish well know. It is still fresh and engrossing to read."
4,Thought Provoking Original,"After having read many apocalyptic scifi novels; this is defenitely utopian. SPOILER: The disappearance of all the victim of the plague is suspiciously clean. Also, the simplification of the breakdown of infrastructure seem a bit too clean. However, having dealt with these questions, Stewart frees the book to deal with the most preponderous question: How do the Survivors of a great diaster rebuild civilization?"
4,Excellent book,George Steward did a great job writing a novel that is timeless in nature. I thought the book was well written and the characters in the book were believable and down to earth. I could not put the book down. The pace of the book was fast and exciting. Each page of the held a new twist or further clarity in the development of each character. I especially enjoyed the development of the relationship between Ish and Em as it spanned over time and life events. George Steward did a great job writing a novel that is timeless in nature George Steward did a great job writing a novel that is timeless in nature.
2,"Starts off decent, then gets painfully boring","I love the apocalyptic genre. I had high hopes for this book and it started off good as the main character travels across the country during the aftermath of the disease (which he did not witness first hand while it was happening). After he meets up with a group of fellow survivors, they form a small community and from then on the whole book just seems to be pointless and boring. I got excited when the main character's two sons decided to take a trip across country, but the story line did not follow them on their trip and we found out little of what they saw and experienced when they returned. That infuriated me. Overall, this book was disappointing."
5,WHAT A BOOK!,"I read this book over 15 years ago and to this day I still cannot get the story out of my head. I wish I can find another copy so I can read it again and even pass it onto my family and friends.What made this story so remarkable was how logical the story line flowed. Everytime I ponder that faitfull question of being one of few left on Earth, I try to take into account the possibilities of how Earth will ""reset"" iteslf around me. Would I want to stay in Florida, move back to California, or go on a quest to some distant land and build my own civilization?Anyway, I highly recommend this book for those who have ever pondered the question of being the ""last person on Earth."""
5,OUTSTANDING,"As a long time reader of sci-fi, this novel-EARTH ABIDESs is the single best story ever written. I have read it more than 30 times. From the time Ish begins his relent measures to understand what has happen, the start of rebuiding a social group, the developement years, and the final bridge location with Ishs' final thought of ""Men may come and go but Earth abides"" stirs thoughts of --how would you perform in a like setting."
4,"Earth Abides, slowly, subtly","I think this is a post-apocolypse classic because of the unique perspectives the author presents. Rather than focusing on theh flu epidemic that wipes out the majority of humanity, the author focuses on one man's experience of it through the rest of his life as he joins with other survivors and the beginnings of their ""tribe"" come together. There is really less ""action"" than one might expect as the author tells the story of ""post-flu"" life and the subtle, slow changes that emerge as human beings begin living more in balance with the planet. A very beautiful story really as humanity comes to know iteself apart from ""civilization."""
4,I can't wait for my 11 year-old son to read it!,"I have been looking for this book for a long time. I read this book for an Environmental Science class at Long Beach State about 20 years ago and it made such an impact on my thinking about the environment. Every time I see grass growing up through the cracks in the street or the roots wrapping around pipes I think of the book. While the environment seems quite fragile, it appears that it is not a fragile as we think and we are the fragile ones."
2,an old book that honestly doesn't hold up,"earth abides may have been original when it came out a zillion years ago but it's dated now and can't compete with stories being written today. the hero is some boob who survives the plague only by stepping on a rattlesnake? wow. and then he can't even teach children to read. why not? there are some good moments here and there, but in the end this book is a yawn."
2,Diarrhea of the pen,"Some good ideas. Some interesting speculations on the nature of man and society. Some interesting predictions of how the earth would respond to a die-off of humans. Ruined by needless wordiness, 2 dimensional characters and very little to say of a philosophical nature. A bore and a disappointment. Skimmed the last 100 pages."
1,A stupid endeavor,"This novel is possibly the worst piece of drivel I've ever tried to force myself through, and I didn't make it. I quit, and honestly I almost never do that. Ish is maybe the most detestable figure I have ever had the displeasure of meeting on the page. He's a passive aggressive psycho, a terrible father and leader, and the last man you would want to rebuild civilization. In this type of scenario, anyone with any intelligence that came into contact with him would disengage quickly. I simply might have shot him for being a drain of precious resources. If the whole point centers on the fact that most or any man would fail in this situation, I would have preferred that Stewart kill off Ish in a 20 page short story."
2,"Sorry, I just didn't get it.","I see many people loved this book, but having just finished it, I just don't get the appeal it has for so many people. I found it incredibly boring and tedious. I do not exaggerate when I say I spent an afternoon struggling with it, nodding off to sleep every two or three paragraphs. To his credit, Stewart raises a number of issues about science and human nature, but it is done in the context of an uneventful story. The first book in years that almost made me abandon it halfway through, but I fought it out to the end. I remained disappointed."
1,I hate Ish!!,"Wow I can't remember the last time I started to hope something bad would happen to the main character in a story. Worst main character in a book ever. Annoying, Lazy, sexist, racist, boring and anti-religionist. Maybe it was the slow story line. Maybe it was the fact that NOTHING happens to the characters after the first 100 pages. I don't know. But I hate this book. I felt like yelling ""Get up and do something!!"" The power goes out and he sits. The streets start to flood and he sits. The water stops running and he sits!! Then he starts to think of himself as a god!! haha. The best part of the book is the end. Why? (spoiler)he dies and you don't have to read anymore.Sorry to ramble but my mind is cloudy now from finishing that ""book"".Do not buy this book. Get it from the library read the first 75 pages then take it back."
1,Overrated,"This book is dull, slow, and predictable. I read most of it hoping that it would pick up but it never did. I usually like these type of disaster books too. Lucipher's Hammer is ten times better than this one. I really have no idea how this book could have 5 stars."
5,YOU COULD BE THERE!!! - EXCELLENT OUT-LOUD READING!!!!!,"Stewart did an excellent job of putting your hand on thehammer! Classic tale of ""What if I were the last man onearth?"" Best read out loud at least twice in your lifetime."
2,If this is who's left after then I hope I don't make it,"This book is about what is wrong with us as humans. The beginning of the book is very interesting as the main character, drives around the country to see what is left in the aftermath of the disease that has wiped out most of the population. After that the book goes downhill. The characters are not that likable. The children are brats, and the adults lack the conviction to make them better people. The items which are in the story aren't realistic (it is very unlikely that gas would not be usable after 20+ years even if stored well), and overall the story just wasn't very interesting to me."
2,Earth Abides,Was disappointed in this book. Expected there to be more action and survivors to be more aggressive in making a better life for themselves. In my opinion people would not act this way in a disaster. They would try to make things better.
5,A memorable book,"I first read this book when I was a teenager and read it again last week (30 years later.) I was surprised at how much I remembered from it (I have completely forgotten books I read 6 months ago!)Of course the book is dated, it was written over 50 years ago and of course technology and social attitudes have changed. Of course the main character is flawed and of course we think we could all have done better, but wouldn't fiction be boring if every character were perfect?I loved the descriptions (in italics) of the breakdown of civillisation, about how plants and animals evolve when ""man"" dissappears.I've looked at some of the reviews for this book and am not surprised that most enlightened readers have given this book 5 stars. Neither am I surprised to see the occasional reader give it one star and to read their vehement reviews. These show that the book has worked and all its readers have strong opinions about it."
5,One of the best books I've ever read,"This is a book everyone should read; a book worthy of being read over and over during a lifetime. I've read it twice and will probably read it several more times. The subject of a disastrous plague almost wiping out civilization is written in such a way that it's entirely believable. It's fascinating to see how Mr. Stewart's characters face survival. The very last part of the book is a bit confusing, but then life viewed from the point of a very old person may be very confusing."
2,Earth Abides: The Drinking Game,"Every time the protagonist passes judgement on other characters, have a drink.Every time the protagonist compares himself to a god or demi god, have a drinkEvery time the protagonist says ""Oh! Mother of Nations"" or ""Oh Joey!"" have a drink.Every time the protagonist refers to himself as the last American despite there being evidence that other communities of survivors have formed, likely with their own elders, take a drink.Every time you find an editing error, have a drink.You may want to take it one chapter at a time so you are not utterly intoxicated. The book was most interesting for the interpretation of what post pandemic America could be like. However, the story moves slowly and the dialogue is stilted and awkward. Not as good as I had hoped for."
2,Naive,I know this is the grandfather of post-apocalyptic fiction but some of the attitudes expressed in this book are so dated and unrealistic that they pulled me out of the story. There are lots of poetic passages and lyrical writing but the hero is surprisingly unsympathetic and uncharismatic for my taste.
2,"a beginning that sizzles, an ending that fizzles.","An aging story. I liked the book on a whole, but the middle and end dragged into tedium.The first half of the book was very interesting to me, and I enjoyed the writing immensely. The last half of the book, on the other had was very, very slow.By the time the end came I was ready for it to be over, and did not much care what happened to everybody after that. good riddance."
3,"OK, but not great","With so many books available to read, is this one worth your time? Ultimately, you'll have to make that decision, but I hope my review can help in some way.There are some technology issues with the story that clearly show it was written in the late 1940's; however, these don't detract too much from the story.There are also a few typos in the Kindle edition, which I assume is a scanning problem when converting to eBook format.The two main issues I had with the book are:1. Food - It is unrealistic to think that people would be subsisting off canned food for 20+ years, let alone, 40+ years at the end of the book.2. Future generations - Without ruining the ending, the book makes a plot decision on how Ish decides to pass knowledge on to future generations. I liked two aspects of what he did, but I thought the rest was foolish.I liked the book overall, but I didn't necessarily think it was a ""great"" work."
2,Ho Hum....Yawn,"I bought this book based on the overall good ratings.I speed read through most of it, hoping it would pick up. I can't stand the idea that these people weren't a little more intelligent and chose to preserve what they had and plan for the future without technology. They had a whole freakin' University Libary for pete's sake!Out of the whole book I got that Ish was the only inteliigent one but didn't have the teaching skills to subsequently teach the next generations.If you like post-apolcolytipic books, then I highly recommend ""One Second Later"" by Fortschen. The spelling may be off slighly....I don't have the book here. There is a line-up at work to read it. This book scared the hell out of me. And as a professional health care worker I could see the devastating domino effect happening like this book portrayed. Like the book ""One Second Later"" says, ""Its not IF, but WHEN."""
5,Memorable Book,"""Earth Abides"" is one of the best books I have ever read. Even though it was written in 1949, it seems to me like it could have been written yesterday. Very thought-provoking and memorable. I would definitely recommend this book to anyone who desires a good read. I couldn't put it down. I finished it several days ago and it still stays in my mind. I bought this book for my Kindle, but I think I am going to order a hard copy too - it was that good."
5,Long-cherished book.,I have been searching for this book for the past 35 years. It was a story I have never forgotten since reading it in my teens. I applaude the publisher who has reissued it. Can't wait to read it again and share it with my friends.
3,Survival after the collapse of civilization.,"Typical? maybe today, an age where every scenerio of doom has been played over and over again like some bad rock song. Fear not! This book is good. It was fresh once. . .now it reminds us of what fiction use to be written like. Like a good Doyle or Burroughs. I liked it."
1,Any book I don't care to finish gets 1 star,"I love to read, so there are very few books I don't finish. I usually slog through even the bad ones. Here's my take on this book. I was looking for a novel about how people came up with creative ideas about how to survive in a world after civilization is wiped out. This book dealt with that facet somewhat in the first hundred pages. After that most of the book deals with moral issues. ""What are the moral or ethical responsibilities of survivors"" is the main theme of the rest of the book. After an ok start, the whole rest of the book seemed preachy and a little like the author was trying to coerce me into agreeing with his point of view. Three-quarters of the way through the book I quit reading, because there were no characters I was interested in enough to care what happened to them."
1,Crap,"Written by a self-righteous professor of English Lit from Berkeley. The authors preconceived notions about the ignorance of rest of us comes across pretty clearly, as his protagonist constantly judges everyone based on his perception of their intelligence. Book was very poorly researched....the protagonist and his children live mostly off of 20-30 year old canned food for most of the book (something that would probably kill you). He fixes up a jeep and then fills it with 20 year old gasoline (which is unusable a year or two after its refined). He raises his offspring in total ignorance...his greatest achievement being to teach them how to make a bow and start a fire (teaching them to read was apparently not important). Worse end of the world book I've ever read."
2,"Slow, lengthy, overly expository.","I'm surprised so many people rated this book so highly. It's hideously dated, both in language, and in writing style. Not even in the same ballpark as something like The Stand. It was interesting to think about what path civilization would take without a unifying threat after an apocalypse, but the writing just ruined it for me. No great character development at any point, a lot of cliches and brushed over details. It kept me reading, barely, mostly to see if it went anywhere. Pretty disappointing though."
4,Lots of fun,"I saw the original version in Hungarian when I was a teenager and loved the movie very much. THe review above says it's a bad james bond movie from the 70's and 80's. Well, don't forget that the cartoon was made in the 80's. If all the fun is lost in the English version, maybe the English script writers should be blamed. I am looking forward to seeing it again."
3,Macskafogo,"I was looking for this DVD long time ago. When I was young I loved the movie and I wanted to watch it together with my husband. But when I last saw it I was around 16 and back then I saw the original hungarian version with excellent casting, different text, different names... This english version didn't take far the same telling effect on the 36 year old of me. I was watching the hungarian version alone.. That was much better. :)"
5,SO FREAKY FUNKY,"This album is THE BEST ONE the chili peppers ever made, you can't miss it!!It rocks, is funky and makes me wanna jump up and dance..."
1,Bad remaster -- a complete waste of money,"Basically they increased the volume and called it a remaster. I compared tracks side by side with the original CD release.As a comparison The Beatles remaster from 2010 was excellent. Previously unheard of instruments coming through without being drowned out by ""volume""."
2,Disappointed.....,This is early RHCP work and you can tell that. To me this album is pretty much indescibable rap and funk fused into someone that sounds like choking. I will not be listening to this album anymore and I gave it two stars (and lucky I did) because of two good songs in Backwoods and Behind The Sun. Everything else is a miss. Even the Bonus tracks all demos and studio scrubs are a waste of time to listen. This is the RHCP's young and not mature enough through experience.
5,Awesome,"This is a must have cd for a fan and collector, because its very up-beat, fun, and funky. Damn fine lyrics, and all. Reminds me of how cool Hillel Slovak was with the band. This album is a GREAT party cd."
5,THE FIRST GREAT ALBUM BY THE PEPPERS....,"This is the third album by the PEPPERS...and i gotta say is where they turn into a great funk rock band...Their first 2 albuns are too weird and bad produced, but on UPLIFT MOFO PARTY PLAN they bring some maturity to the songs...i like all the songs, like BACKWOODS, ME AND MY FRIENDS,FUNKY CRIME, WALKING DOWN THE ROAD and their hits FIGHT LIKE A BRAVE and BEHIND THE SUN."
3,Knowing how to party,"3 1/2There was a reason no one gave these guys lip for naming themselves what they did. From the start the Chili's defined adolescent aggression with an elegance rarely matched in the kind of recklessly abandoned, unhinged punk-funk these pioneered by these stale cucumbers. Ironically as the quality of compositions improved throughout the years, so the genuine energy level depleted."
4,Fun to own and listen to.,"I got into the Peppers in high school almost 10 years ago. I bought this album after Mother's Milk, which subsequently led me to buy the other previous albums as well. Uplift is a great album that I still enjoy. The songs are fun, fast, funky and great to jam in the car. This album is more raw and not as refined as Mother's Milk, and no where near as perfect as Blood Sugar Sex Magik, but a great album that I recommend to fans of the band. While their first two albums are fun to own and listen to as trivia and to be a ""true fan"", Uplift is a disc you will like. This album shows the potential of what the band will become."
5,A Hard-To-Find Classic,"This series displayed Moore at a level seldom equalled since. He is funny, original and penetrating without being quite as annoyingly earnest as he's become more recently.And we get a younger Janeane Garofalo at her irreverent best. Before she left Moore's gang to become a comedienne, she was a crusading investigative attack journalist, spearheading a landing party on a private Connecticut beach.The show was suprising for its time: it was a summer replacement on network TV, and the fact that it was actually shown was, truly, a bit unexpected. It showed a younger, fresher Moore, less strident and less self-important.A Moore I liked a lot better, and you will, too. Too bad this video is so hard to find!"
3,EP-mode gave poor quality,"This tape was recorded in the EP mode and my $400, 4-head VCR had difficulty tracking it. In fact, the video was snowy throughout and only passably watchable. The audio portion was fine. I've watched other EP-mode tapes, such as the ""Twin Peaks"" series that has five episodes per tape, with no problems. I got a second copy to see if it was just the tape. But the second one was just as bad. The content is fine, although rather than watching two episodes, I'd rather see greatest hits since the original shows had some weak moments. Beware if you don't have a fancy VCR that allows you to adjust tracking, you might have trouble watching this tape."
3,A different type of lock,"This lock has its advantages and disadvantages.The advantages are:-retractable cord makes it super portable and easy to store in your computer bag.Disadvantages:-the cord is short. Even though the cord goes 4 feet, it must loop back around to the base device making the effective distance from the thing you want to secure your computer to 2 feet. If you frequent a place where the only thing you can lock to is greater than 2 feet away from your computer, you should look elsewhere.-You continually have to take out the adapter when you want to secure your computer and you have put it back in when you are done."
2,Ok but out of date,I was a little disappointed but it my own fault. I knew that The AP Spanish Language exam had changed and hoped that it had more reading comprehension exercises and practice but as it is the book really is not adequate for the new test.It was very good for the old exam but several parts of the exam have been eliminated and therefore those practice exercises are irrelevant now.
5,"Lovely, but top-heavy","I had a whole set of these years ago. We broke one within the first hour after unpacking. Every last one was broken within three years. The problem is that they are rather top-heavy while the foot is not wide enough to handle that weight so they tend to tip over much too easily.They do have the heft of fine crystal and are very elegant, but before you spend money on them just know that they'll tip over on you if you so much as look at them funny."
1,Damaged Goblet,Order for the item was processed but never delivered. The merchant said the goblet was damaged and did not provide a replacement. This was a Christmas gift and I was not able to find a replacement in the remaining time. Poor performance....do not use this vendor if you want reliable service.
3,Too Verbose,"I enjoyed the book as to general content. However, there was way too much extraneous detail. As a result, I found myself skipping pages and had difficulty staying focused."
3,Not Enough Review Materials,"Princeton Review publishes many excellent prep books, but this isn't among them. The only recommended method for ""cracking"" the exam that I could find was the advice to read widely. I didn't need to spend good money to find that out. There is no survey or summary of the AP English Lit. syllabus, such as important books, literary movements, rhetoric or important authors to help fill in the gaps in one's knowledge. The sample tests give one a sense of the test format, but the answers won't be of much use beyond answering the particular question, in the unlikely event it shows up on the test you take."
3,Nice but not thick at all!!,"If you are looking for thick nice shirts to wear then this is NOT for you. The shirt is very nice and fits really well, I bought them for someone and ended up wearing them. However these are thin shirts and might suit more for under-shirts."
3,What can u say about tshirts?,"There tshirts, enough said. Except perhaps that they do shrink a bit and you absolutely get what you pay for. For the price they work."
3,Tee shirts,"These are decent undershirts. There are a few issues as they don't hold their shape well and are a little baggier than I am used to. That being said, I gave three stars due to the price point on these. Quick delivery also helps."
3,Looked smaller than a large,"The cotton is very soft and hopefully with many washings the shirts will not shrink any, they seem a little small."
5,comfortable.,"feels good on me. good fit and comfortable. no complaint. some reviewers mention the thinness of these t-shirts, i actually don't mind. in this time of rampant inflation & escalating gas prices, i think the price is reasonably fair. but you may differ."
1,"Don't buy, period.","I seldom post reviews, but I have to now. I purchased these because I wanted the ""thinner"" ""undershirt"" (see prior discussions on these topics). The good news is that they are thin as a undershirt should be. The bad news is that that they are useless. I bought a package and sent them to the washer. I washed in the warm/cold combo, dried them only to damp, and hung them to complete drying. Then I tried them on. Wow. Either there was carnival prize t-shirt shrinkage or they came off of the kid's line-up initially. They were tiny. They were so tiny I actually measured. The length of the sleeve underarm, in a size large, was 2 1/2 inches.I took them back and bought some Hanes. Washed and dried them the same way. They fit like they should, and had another two inches in under-sleeve length. Huge difference in quality.Beware the Fruit on this one."
2,Practically see through,"what else can I say? they are practically see through. material so thin, i can see my body in the mirror in a well light room. it is thinner than the Fruit of the Loom i have wore for three years.(but from what i have gathered, all brands are like super thin now?)Use five star review:- material: **, super thin; at least the cotton feels comfortable- fit: **, it bit big, because of wrong size info- length: ****, it is pretty long, can definitely tuck in nicelywon't recommend it to anyone who wants a high quality comfortable undershirt. looks like i have to shell out more money for designer brands?one more thing. Amazon.com has to improve its site a little. the size info on this product is totally wrong! the size info are for boxer and brief, NOT for t-shirt."
3,"Thin, But OK","As others have said, these are not the thicker T-shirts you may find at a retail store and they are a thinner shirt, but they work OK for me. Would I re-purchase? Possibly."
4,Good Quality For Price,Fruit of the Loom Men's Crewneck Tee 5 PackGood quality for the price. Not as thick as in the past but works very well in the Midwest with winter weather rapidly approaching.
1,"Poor Quality, not like described",Historically a trusted name brand. Took a chance and the shirts are a very poor quality that after two washes are not holding their shape. I wont by this product again.
3,Not the same quality as in stores - too thin,"We've bought Fruit of the Loom tees for years at local retailers. We trusted the brand since we've had such good experience with them. So we decided to try buying oline.These t-shirts were thinner than the ones in the store, almost see-through. That was disappointing, and it's not worth returning the item so we are pretty much stuck with them.Unless there was some way to guarantee the same quality as in the local stores, I think we'll stick with buying these locally where you can feel the material."
1,Rough!! Scratchy!!!,"These look like cotton t-shirts, but feel very coarse and scratchy. I would not buy them again. How now brown cow."
4,Great,These shirts were great for ye dying. Thick and the cotton were a good quality. I'll buy these again. Really
5,Does what a T-shirt is supposed to do,"Well...uhm...jeez... I never in my life was asked to rate my underwear. But, ok, they fit well and are comfortable, the tails are long enough so they don't pull out when you bend over, tagless, and the neckline doesn't distort, curl or warp out of shape - like Michael Jordan and the competition want you to believe every T-shirt except theirs does. A good product at a good price."
3,A bit on the lightweight side,I have worn them but my first impression was that they are not as rugged as I expected but then they are undershirts afterall
4,Dog Lover's Delight,"Gladys Taber presents a delightful and informative history of her life with her personal pets and as a breeder of cocker spaniels and Irish setters. Her first childhood pet, an Irish setter, was a reluctant gift from her father who had offered a diamond ring as a reward for good grades in school. Gladys preferred a dog and continued to lavish love and devotion on her dogs and cats throughout her life. Gladys Taber is a marvelous author who takes you back to a simpler time and makes the reader feel that they are there watching a beautiful sunset, smelling spicy aromas from her kitchen or watching her Irish setter run across the lawn at dusk. She gives very practical advice about the care of dogs and the steps involved for those who are interested in training and showing their pets. I grew to love her writing style from her other books and greatly enjoyed this one."
3,Coffee Machine is Great,"The Brewer is great the grinder isnot,too many parts, difficult programing. The grinder cover is not secure therefore grounds enter the coffee, so I personally donot use the grinder feature- sort of defeats the purpose I guess."
1,Are we in France?,And why would we want to purchase a single for more than the price of the whole album? Especially since this album has already been digitally remastered form from the original source tapes at remastering sessions that Ian Anderson himself sat in on to ensure the most true sonic quality.*sigh*
5,10 stars out of 5 possible.,"I could write a book about why this is an awesome album, going down to every little detail, but let's make this short.Great songwriting, the guitarist is out of this world - the guitar solos are as good as for ex. EUROPE's solos from the 80's, amazing, mystical atmosphere in the songs. Thrilling lyrical themes and a mysterious wonderful cover."
1,One of the worst books ever,"I'm a systems researcher myself. I can't believe this book is allowed to be in publication. The writing is shoddy, and the relevancy of the material is fragmented. The poor quality is perfectly encapsulated by the two luminaries praising the book on the back cover. One is from Centre College, some liberal arts college I had never heard of; the other is supposedly a professor from the University of California, but upon closer investigation, he's only a staff member, not a real professor. This book has a second-hand feel to it throughout. If you're a student forced to use this book in college, I suggest you change colleges."
2,Could have been better,"Like the title says, this could have been better. No doubt it's difficult to write a ""modern"" book on operating systems in such a tumultuous area. There were blatant errors, especially in examples, and it seemed like the ""In The Hangar"" sections were the most relevant parts of the book. However, coupled with the ""Kernel Projects for Linux"" book, it is much better. If you need it for a class, you have no choice. Otherwise I'd check out books by Tanenbaum or the ""dinosaur"" OS books."
1,Words cannot express how much I hate this book,"I only bought this book because it was required for my Operating Systems Design course. I find the book very difficult to follow and comprehend. The chapter exercises are frustrating because the answers to the questions are rarely in the chapter text! I know I speak for every one of my classmates when I say this is a poor textbook. If you are a professor and are reading this, PLEASE do not use this book. Find another one!"
2,overwrought ans underdone,a weak attempt at an introductory text...in trying to simplify the subject too much meat has been pared from the bones...the result is a sometimes confusing and often plainly erroneous text...spend the extra seven bucks and get either stallings or tanenbaum...if you buy this book I hope it is for a wedding gift to a couple you do not like...
2,You know something. You read this book on it. Now you don't know it anymore,"If you have to read it like me for a class, then there is no choice but to get it. However, if you have a choice, don't read it. Read the man pages... for they give a better understanding of it.Take a subject, like Public Key Encryption. Search Google on how it works, read wikipedia, and all that fun reads to get a good understanding of the subject. Now read the chapter of how Nutt describes it... You will question yourself if you really understand it. Worst of all, he knows that it is confusing and tries to explain it another way, but only loses you more.One of many examples..."
1,"Wordy, convoluted, boring","Nutt spends an amazing number of pages covering simple topics, yet his writing is so convoluted, learning from this book is very difficult. He attempts to take a mathematical approach to such simple topics as first-come-first-served scheduling algorithm where the math simply confuses the matter. Overall, this book is boring and hard to understand."
3,Not a bad book - tough to read in sections.,"Overall, this book covers the topic adequately with alot of examples and indepth applications. There are sections where Nutt can get alittle obtuse with his mathematical treatise on the subject matter. There are also alot of typo errors throughout the book so be sure to get the errata sheet. Keep in mind that computer science is a tough field and requires alot of discipline and mental apptitude. There are alot of people trying to enter this field who simply do not have the ability at this. Hence, some of the aforementioned criticisms of this book are not totally justified. The book does require work and that is what computer science is all about - HARD WORK!"
