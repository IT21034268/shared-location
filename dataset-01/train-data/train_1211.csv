5,I love it!,The product came in early and it was very nicely wrapped so the product would not get broken. I love it :)
5,AWESOME!,"That is what my 9 year old girl said when she opened it. She especially loved the dvd because she only has tv concert footage recorded on tape. I especially loved the price compared to in store ones. And I loved the fast service when it was just standard in December. Awesome, Amazon!"
3,not bad,"Yeah it's pretty good even through most of the solos and stuff are played by an extra guitarist, and the lyrics are kinda cheesy but except that I liked it"
1,BAD,"Why are these guy's so famous? I have no reason why??? They sing horrible!!!!!!!!It hurt my ears listening to them. They also thing that they are all that, because all of their interviews they act like they are the most awesome peope ever. There is not one good song on this album. I HATED IT"
4,Great CD,I purchased this cd for my 6 year old son but find myself listening to it when he is not around. Nice sound. Clean lyrics. I really enjoy it and don't mind my children listening to it.
5,Rockn' Blast of Youthful Fun,"My kids and I love this CD, fun for the whole family. These brothers rock. Can't wait for new ablum to come out."
3,non-essential but fun,"Zappa was not in top shape around this time, but still he turns out some tunes that never cease to amaze me: Tink, Luigi and Moggio are quintessential Zappa, while at the same time something of a surprise. I wonder how Godfather part 1-3 would benefit from the inclusion of Luigi in the soundtrack... I don't like his 'sprech-gesang' really (is this German because it's a typical German habit or what), but generally a good album."
3,Get The Vinyl--the CD version blows.,"The production on this CD blows. The scat/guitar sections, you cannot hear the guitar, whereas on the album, it's in your face. The drums on Cocains Decisons blow out your woofer, and the album is fat.It is a known fact that this remaster for CD is horrible. The sound and song orders are different, as well as arrangements are different.Do yourself a favor. Find a good copy of the album and convert it to CD. You will know what I mean."
3,"Not one of Zappa's best, but worth 9 dollars","Some good stuff mixed with some of his most offputting and annoying material. For FZ fans only; don't make this your first Zappa purchase or you'll probably never get by ""Jazz Discharge Party Hats"" or ""Dangerous Kitchen"", or buy anything else by him."
2,You Can Sleep Easy If You Miss It - But It Has It's Moments,"Not one of Zappa's most inspired albums. The instrumentals are good, but few of the 'joke' songs, which make up the bulk of the album, actually click. ""Cocaine Decisions"" is a keeper, and so is ""The Jazz Discharge Party Hats"". The rest isn't really that notable - ""SEX"" is just too flat & straight-forward for a man who has written so many more clever sex-related anthems. The extremely similar twins, ""The Dangerous Kitchen"" & ""The Radio Is Broken"" are kind of enjoyable for their silliness, but really aren't that funny or musically intriguing.Nothing essential here."
2,"bueno , esta bien, hasta los genios la pifian alguna vez.......","quizas ,para los fanaticos de zappa,debe ser dificil tener que comentar alguna placa que no sorprende, es mas, aburre por momentos. este disco, deja un gusto amargo en la boca y porque no decirlo, en los oidos tambien....erratico, monotono por momentos, predecible, repetido, en fin....siempre es cool alabar la obra de este musico genial, aunque a veces debemos sincerarnos y dejar este disco abandonado en ese lugar poco accesible de nuestra discoteca... ya vendrian mejores tiempos para el maestro..."
3,Some great songs to fill in a 'Worst of Zappa' album,"The cover is great, but the music and they lyrics are worse then the previous vocal albums (Joe's Garage, Sheik Yerbouti etc.).Baubling humor, sometimes annoying music. Some instrumentals like'Moggio' are good, but not enough to say, that's worth that I've bought this album. Don't start with this."
2,Something is going wrong,Unfortunately this FZ's album make me cry for the money i spend for it... Why Frank?
2,Inflated and flawed,"If you've seen the movie, you already know the biggest plot problem is the way the Genesis planet operates. What happens to Spock makes no -- forgive me -- logical sense. The author doesn't tidy up the gaping plot holes very much. She just puts a little more meat on the bones of story that already has skeletal flaws. Huge chunks of the novel were so close to word for word recitations of the movie's dialogue, they might as well have reprinted the actual script and sold that.And call me a stickler but I do wish these writers would study a bit more Star Trek cannon and the technical details rights. The Kirk's Enterprise is NOT a Constellation class starship. It's a Constitution class. Kruge's ship is a Bird of Prey not a ""fighter"". Getting the details right is not too much to ask in a book you could have written in a couple of weeks."
5,A Master Work,"I've been re-reading this book for 15 years and still find get something new from it each time. I judge all other sci-fi by this book and nothing has ever matched it. Jerry Pournelle once mentioned that he *attempted* to write a sequel to Space Viking but couldn't begin to match the details. The best part is that the reader never notices the acute attention to detail Mr. Piper must have paid to this . . you just enjoy the story. PS. no, I'm not related"
4,Bracing adventure sf with an historical perspective,"A great, now semi-forgotten space opera classic. Space Viking has the sheer readability and forward momentum of good pulp science fiction but with an extra historical dimension lacking in most pulp. Or to put it another way, this could be the best Heinlein-style novel not written by Heinlein. Also could well have been an influence on Star Wars, but don't let that put you off. Set in the same (""Terro-Human"") future history as Piper's Fuzzy novels, but after the breakup of the Federation. The stand-alone quality of Space Viking, plus the action and economy, put it a notch higher in my affection than the Fuzzy series. This was probably his best sf novel and should by rights be put back into print."
4,A good read.,Really enjoyed the book and will continue to look for other H. Beam Piper Kindle books. Especially all the free ones.
5,Power tools for your hand,"The saw is great. We all know they outperform all other hand saws. S0 fast and easy to use. Those old Japanese woodworkers really know their stuff.It doesn't matter if it's a fine cut or a rough cut. This saw kicks hiney! But you know what ? It pales into insignificance next to the prybar! I love this tool! You can't imagine how useful it is until you have one in your hand. All my other pry bars are gathering dust. The tip is so sharp you can easily slip it in behind delicate trim for easy removal. It makes a fine scraper for everything from glue to paint to concrete. The claw is so sharp that you don't even need a head to pull a nail with it. It will grip the shank like a vise. The design is much like the exhumer, but the other end is much more useful. Unbeleivable. I liked it so much, I bought 5 more so we would never be short on the job. Both sizes are perfect. Better get a bunch because your friends will want one too!"
4,Just Like Heaven,I liked it!I thought it was good!Just what I expected!Sort of like the movie.Good Bye!Thanks!
4,Great tunes!,"If you like this movie or not, you will love this soundtrack. Great tune by Beck and redo of Cure's song."
3,Highly Entertaining Throughout,This book took me on an adventurous ride throgh time with many unexpected twists.This was a delightful book. I enjoyed it greatly. Mary Stewart added a magical touch to this magnificant novel.-New York Times
5,A Rare Video Concert of an Incredible Musician,"Eric Johnson is one of those incredibly talented musicians that seems to have been missed by the mainstream media and public over the years for whatever reason. One reason probably was the lack of exposure; a handful of Austin City Limits shows on PBS late at night, and a handful of CD's that never got played on the radio. He won a Grammy for ""Cliffs of Dover,"" in 1991, which got radio airtime, but no one ever knew who played, ""that guitar song.""With this DVD, anyone, at anytime can now see and hear, what music fans in Austin, Texas and in concerts around the world have witnessed, probably the most talented guitarist, of various styles, that has ever played the instrument.If you've never seen or heard of Eric Johnson, after watching this DVD, you'll know why he's often referred to among guitar players, as one of, if not THE, greatest guitar gods of all time.The DVD is one amazing hour of Eric from 1988."
5,Very good,"Eric at his top. Sound quality is no good compared against the studio productions but performance is astonishing, in particular I am thrilled how Eric can change from a distorted sound to a clean one."
4,good for die-hard eric johnson fans.,"The audio quality of this DVD is not so great, but it is still a must have for die-hard Eric Johnson fans. Watching Mr. Johnson perform his guitar magic is worth the price."
4,Very Good,"I truly enjoyed the Eric Johnson DVD. The sound quality and picture quality were pretty good, considering the filming from the mid 80's and transfer from some older source. All the songs were really fun and have watched it numerous times. Compared to something like 'Orchestra Yes' DVD, it was inferior. I highly recommend this DVD; as I had looked on the web for copies of it for a few years and was hesitant to order some bootleg cheap version. I'm glad I waited. One can tell this is a young Johnson by his demeanor and after seeing him in the late 90's in Memphis, he has matured considerably in playing and audience repoire.Charles"
1,Save your money,"This bar looks like it would be a good buy if you are going to tear down a building or even a wall. Save your money my friend. It only looks good. It is clumsly as hell to get on an old nail that sticks up about 1/2 inch. The metal used in its construction is so soft that after pulling about a dozen nails the V bar was peeled back so much it won't grasp the head on the nail anymore. It looks mean and strong but it is heavy, clumsly and soft. Save your money and buy an old gooseneck model made of real steel."
1,Not son-in-law resistant,"The finish on the head is smooth enough to work on smoth wood without marking the wood. I had only used it lightly and was fairly satisfied except the nail pulling slots were not suitable for anything smaller than 16d. I loaned it to my son-in-law who broke the weld between the shaft and head tearing out the floor of a bathroom. I don't know what he did to it he claims ""nothing""."
4,Very good product,Protects the liver against chemical assault! Dosage is pretty high but definitely worth it. Much cheaper to buy on line vs at Whole foods.
3,Weird nasty smell,I've taken another brand and it had no odor. This one has a terrible smell when I open the bottle. I don't know if it is just this bottle or if it just the way this stuff is supposed to smell. I'll keep taking it until the bottle is finished but not sure whether I will buy this brand again.
4,It is good but too big portion.,If you buy it you have to split it if you want to use it for a regular intake.
1,dissatisfied in Ohio,the last two bottles I purchased of N-AcetylCyceine pills were a huge disappointment. I had to throw the one bottle away because the pills smelled like rotten eggs. So I opened up the new bottle just sent to me and they too are starting to smell like rotten eggs. Do not know why this is happening but I will never purchase this brand again.
3,poets or gangsters,"This isn't much more than gangsters rappin in spanish ova a catchy beat. Reggaetone has potential if it went towards its native roots and instruments,rather than american wannabe gangsters and cheap coast gangsta beats. All said its rather amazing how the genre is blowing up worlwide coming from a couple small islands."
4,"Perhaps, but please keep offending me like you do...","Same problem as Strictly commercial: you think that you have essential Zappa songs, but if you have any taste / musical integrity, you'll end up wanting more Zappa albums. This one has the added benefit of many new mixes and two new live versions, so you might consider it essential anyway"
2,Zappa doesn't shine like he normally does.,"The only reasons I gave this cd two stars are, first, the lyrics are quite good, and second, some late-Zappa fans might take a liking to this. However, if you are looking for some great Zappa guitar solos, look elsewhere, this cd contains maybe about ten chords and possibly a five second solo somewhere in there. Guitar aside, it's clear that these are the songs which Zappa put the least amount of effort into. So, if you're prepared to buy a cd merely for its amusing qualities and you're ready to turn all your musical tastes off, be my guest. If you want a fine Zappa album, again, look elsewhere. These are not good songs, and if you like them, I'm sorry if I am offending you, you're tone-deaf. Zappa should have called this cd, 'I don't even have to try and they'll buy this!'"
5,Informative and authoratitive,"I recently bought two books on the NY Subway to help me gain a greater understanding of how the system works. The other book (""The Subway : A Trip Through Time on New York's Rapid Transit"" by Stan Fischler) was far more anecdotal in nature, and for me the lesser of the two books.This book, however, was very informative and gave a comprehensive history of the Subway system, and seemed to be much easier to read (I got through it over a rainy weekend!). The pictures, while being in black and white, were of a good standard and crystal clear.A most enjoyable book, and I would recommend it highly."
1,"Great subject, poor writing","I want to know the history of the subway system in New York. It has always fascinated me from an engineering and histroical standpoint and as a frequent rider (mostly on the Green Lexington 4 Line, between Wall Street, Grand Central and Yanqui Stadium) I am a great fan.But try as I might, I could not finish this book. Turgid, it is. What a waste of a beautiful subject!"
1,not enough instruction,My kids were so excited to try this video. Boy were they disappointed. There is very little instruction. The dances are too hard. The instructor does not do enough teaching. He expects the kids to just follow along. I sure feel ripped off. Dont' waste your money.
1,"""Latest"" dance moves?","This video is outdated. I didn't notice the date when I bought it, but after playing it, I looked it up and found it was produced in 1996! So, the latest dance moves are not in this dvd. Some kids won't notice that, but the savvy ones sure will! It is definitely hard to follow, especially as the dancers are facing the viewers, making it harder to copy what they are doing with their feet."
5,Great,"This TV is the best that I have seen. I paid more for a 46"" 15 years ago and the picture quality was poor. This was a good buy and I am watching old movies that I have seen because of the great picture. Just like being in the movie theater. A joy to watch."
3,Great service - Great Product,"Great service and delivery from Amazon and its partner for this product. Easy to unpack and install. I used HDMI cables to pair my HD cable box and an up-converting Samsung DVD player. Picture is awesome in HD. It's like going to the movie theatre. I'm also using a Pioneer receiver for 5.1 surround sound. LED DLP offers great advantages over earlier models - no heat producing light bulp - no fan to cool it and make noise - no color wheel. All-in-all, a great value and a great product. Family and freinds are amazed at the picture quality."
1,Great Picture except for Banding.. and the fact it broke 3 times in under 5 years.,Worst TV purchase ever. First two repairs required a new power board because caps blew. I was thankfully able to buy the powerboard and install in myself the 2nd time. The first repair cost $500 from a Samsung Service tech. I fixed it the 2nd time for $80 in parts. The first repair occurred about 18 months after my purchase. Just outside of the warranty... The 2nd repair was needed 15 months later. And it finally died this year... about 5 years after my purchase. Half the screen went green/red... and the part to repair it cost $400 and was out of stock. Currently the TV is sitting in our guest room... Sadly they don't make Televisions like they used to. I did some research online and this TV in general is a lemon. I don't think anyone owns a working version of this set. They all have died or been repaired multiple times. Samsung is of no assistance.
2,How to fix this TV once it breaks,"This review is more for people who already bought the TV and wonder why it isn't working after a year and a half or so. Long story short is that it's probably the power supply.[...]ps: As a disclaimer, capacitors in tube tvs still hold a lethal charge even when they are unplugged. I know this isn't a tube TV, but I figure it wouldn't hurt to mention that."
1,Didn't last 3 days!,"When I first got the set, it was fantastic, however, by the third day, all i could see is a dark picture with sound. I have been waiting two weeks for my tv to be serviced right, unfortantly it hasn't. The engineer came twice two fix my TV. First he replased the main and then he replaced the sub power, both not doing anything to solve the propblem with the picture. The worst thing is that they didnt have any LED in stock which was the part that was badly needed! I'm currently waiting for a replacement."
1,This TV is Garbage and so is Samsung,"I purchased this TV in April of 2007 and it was faulty from the start. The screen kept flickering pink every once in a while, until about 2 weeks ago the screen went dark. No picture, no color, just sound... whatever happened to TVs lasting like 15-20 years like the ones my parents used to own.I called Samsung and they sent a request to their crappy middlemen service company. These idiot service people don't know anything about fixing TVs and they take their sweet time ordering parts from Samsung. It's been over a week and it could take another 2 more weeks.I find this UNACCEPTABLE. Samsung's TVs are garbage and so is their service."
1,The price will keep dropping -- for good reason,"Video and audio are out of sync. Blacks in non HD programming are often grainy. It has an audio optical out, but it does not pass along DD 5.1 signal, so it's pointless to use the tv's audio output. ""white glove"" delivery service is a total joke. That is, a disaster. Insufficient space to describe the entire chronology, but Eagle and their partners are buck-passing incompetents. To top it off, when set was finally delivered, I had to help the driver unload it from the truck and then help him place it on the stand. The final topper is that the price drops by more than $100 just after I purchase. Sometimes a bargain is not worth the $ you save. I would return this lemon if it were not for the myriad hoops through one has to leap."
2,not too happy,the LED board went out on this my tv after a year or so. i replaced it myself (after doing extensive research) and the tv got messed up again a year later. now the problem was something else that was going to cost $250 so i junked th tv and bought something else
2,great tv but didnit last long,"I got this tv 2 and a half years ago. It was a great easy to use tv but my tv is on its way out. About 3 of my friends got this tv around the same time. One of them is done dead mine is on the way out and the next guys is giving him trouble. So all i have to say is that i will never buy another DLP tv of any make or shape ever again. The best part is it would cost use $800 dollars to fix. I have purchase a LG lcd and writing this one off. You want my opinion never buy one, trouble trouble trouble."
5,Amazing HDTV,"This set has an incredibly sharp picture and excellent color. It dislays HD DVDs and Hi def satellite pictures with better clarity than I have ever seen (we also have a 1080p lcd, a 1080i crt projector, and a 720p plasma set) and it is incredible to think there are no bulbs to replace, no spinning color wheel, and no plasma burn in to worry about. My son notices a brief shimmering effect at times, but I have never seen it and the picture has always looked excellent to me. I will probably buy another one to replace the plasma, which looks inferior by comparison."
5,***AWESOME***,This TV is great. It is exactly what I wanted and at the right price. Dealing with Amazon was a chore - first one showed up broken and Samsung could not fix it - so 30 days after the first delivery I got the replacement - which is perfect.
1,misses the mark,"""An American Girl"" tries to be amusing in an off-hand way about tragedy: teen-age pregnancy, suicide, sexual molestation, low self-esteem and family abuse. It's a complete package in its misfiring: poorly written, badly acted and amateurishly directed. It wasn't as good as a thrown-together t.v. movie."
4,Awesome,The story is interesting and the characterare querky. Malone is great. I really enjoyed this different movie. Something that Hollywood couldnt and wouldnt put out.
4,Confessions,"Jena plays Rena Grubb, a pregnant teenager. She resides in a trailer home with her brother who may possibly be gay, her half-sister, and her mom. Her father is in prison. In addition to the various assorted issues at home, the movie leads up to a family visit to prison where a few more issues arise. This movie is an awakening for Rena and her family. Before the visit, Rena idolized her father, however, comes to see that he is a loser. Incredibly, by the end of the visit, the family came to realize they have each other and can begin to move on with their lives. Which is the redeeming feature of this witty dark humored movie. Although the movie was released in 2002 it is timely, especially in light of the television hit, ""Secret Life of the American Teenager."" If you are a Jena Malone fan and for some reason have not seen this movie, you need to see it. Jena Malone at her best."
5,LOVE IT,"GREAT PICTURE QUALITY, THE DISC WAS PERFECT, I LOVE THIS MOVIE BECAUSE ITS VERY OUT OF THE REGULAR. THE ACTORS WERE GREAT"
5,Chitty Chitty Bang Bang,"Bright, entertaining, and delightful fun. My family hums and sings the songs all the time. It's a great way to lift your spirits. If you don't have it, you should buy it!"
3,chitty chitty bang bang,this is a brill sound track great for the kids and for the older kid in all of us buy it a go back in time
2,Hard on the ears,"I don't know what album my fellow reviewers were listening to, but the music on my CD is recorded as if at a distance and smothered with a thick gooey echo reminiscent of sixties simulated stereo. The dialogue excerpts (likely from a film or video master) make the music sound worse because they're crisp and clear. (Although we can do without that dead Groucho joke about the elephant. Obviously the film wasn't a laff riot.) Yet another case of bad engineers wreaking havoc on good music, an enjoyable (though not especially memorable) Sherman Brothers concoction from the movie musical's last days. One hopes that whoever next acquires the rights to these ""MGM"" recordings (AAAAARGH!!!) will do them justice, and not just run old reels through a tape machine, and avoid printing the liner notes like a troublemaking road map."
3,Overrated,"The only quality song is ""Hushabye Mountain"" which is brilliant, and the title song is quite hummable and memorable. On a technical level this disc is well produced and Irwin Kostal's orchestrations are up to his usual high quality. Even with all of the weakness of the film and the songs I still have a soft spot for it, due to my childhood memories; hence, there are occasions when this soundtrack suits my mood, but it should have been a much better film and score with the talents involved."
5,Excellent music from a timeless film classic!,"I am sure many of you are familiar with the movie which airs almost every year around Thanksgiving. When I was young, I had the soundtrack on an old 33 RPM album. I played the record so much, you could barely hear the music any longer. Call me crazy, but the title song, ""Chitty Chitty Bang Bang,"" still ranks as one of my all time favorite songs. I tried in vain for years to replace the album; and forget about trying to find it on CD. Finally, it has been re-released, and on CD! Be a kid again! Enjoy the music for yourself! Recall the old days of a young Dick Van Dyke! And if you know where I can find one of the old Chitty Chitty Bang Bang toy cars, let me know!"
5,A childhood classic,"Although one can justifiably quibble with the consistency of the composers' work on this CD and the overall quality of the film itself, the effect of this music is worth more than the sum of its parts. There are endearing melodies and surprising lyrics(look at ""Posh"", observe the title track). There is a schmaltzy counterpoint(""Music Box/Truly Scrumptious"") that works despite itself. And the whole endeavour smells of the workshop that produced ""Mary Poppins"". Argue as you will, there were many of us touched by this flawed score and complicated film. We would be poorer without it."
4,Great Buy,I bought these for my Coast Tek Torch. They sent the wrong ones but with one email they promptly mailed out the correct ones. I have not used them real long but for the price I have no complaints.
3,OK quality at a good price.,"I purchased 2 of these units after having excellent service with former JVC VCR`s. The picture and sound quality is excellent using the ET-SVHS mode with standard tapes. With the [low] price though,many features are missing. In order to view the counter you must use the on screen display,there is no counter incorporated into the clock. The counter will also not operate if you have the superimpose feature turned off,a very annoying feature that floods the screen with all kinds of info. VCR+ is also missing on this unit,and if you turn off the unit after programming,it won`t record if you forget to press the timer button(expected on a VCR from 1985,not 2002). For people who tape many TV shows to watch at a later date,I`d suggest spending the extra [money]for the HRS390 model,which has retained the clock display counter,and VCR+. If you only watch movies on an irregular basis,then this model will suit you fine."
1,very poor performer,"I've had this machine for over a year and experienced recurring problems with its performance. It frequently distorts the picture and sound when playing pre-recorded tapes and when playing tapes recorded in this machine. It seems to be constantly adjusting its tracking, so the picture breaks up and disappears about once per minute. It has had this problem since it was brand new. When it works, the picture is very good, but it works less than half the time."
1,NEVER RECEIVED PRODUCT!,"I first received the wrong product. I contacted the company multiple times, with no response. They then sent me another package of products that I also did not order and said that they would send me the right product when they had in stock. I needed these shorts for something specific, and the time has already passed. I contacted the company again, and again received no response.I would like to refund, but Amazon will not help me out either. I will never order from Amazon again."
2,Unfortunate Event,The books were marked as new and had names written in the front cover. This was not written on the advertisement.
4,"Wickedly witty,delightfully droll...","Lemony Snicket's popular A SERIES OF UNFORTUNATE EVENTS continues with more miserable adventures for the Baudelaire orphans. In THE MISERABLE MILL,the children are sent to the dull town of Paltryville to work in the gloomy ""Lucky Smells Lumbermill"".In the next volume,THE AUSTERE ACADEMY,the Baudelaires attend the dreary ""Prufrok Prepatory School"" run by the dimwitted,meanspirited vice principal Nero.In the sixth episode,the Baudelaires are sent to their distant relatives, Jeremy and Esme Squalor, to live in their oversized penthouse. Lemony Snicket continues his mysterious references to his lost love Beatrice, humorous definitions of words and an ability to make young readers sympathize with the Baudelaire orphans.RATING:A-"
5,can I have my kid back yet??,"My 11 year old will not get his nose out of these books! They are very popular in his 5th grade classroom. Lemony Snicket simply cannot write fast enough to keep us reading! Lemony, please, more!!"
5,THE BAD BEGINNING,SOME PEOPLE WROTE THINGS LIKE THIS BOOK IS NOT FOR KIDS. BUT I THINK IT IS ONE OF THE BEST BOOKS EVER. I LIKE THESE BOOKS BECAUSE IT TEACHES LESSONS FROM TIME TO TIME. I CAN'T WAIT TO READ THE OTHER NINE BOOKS.
1,Not for young children,"Even though the writing style is for young children, the content can get pretty ugly. I'd say wait until they're 11 or 12. For younger children, you might want to check out Ann Tompert & Michael Garland's Saint Patrick or Joan of Arc: Heroine of France or Lisa Wheeler's books."
3,Plot Changes from the Novel,"The movie adaptation is pretty good, except for a couple of glaring changes which will confuse those who have read the novel. (If you haven't read the book, no problem.) The book is a prequel, set in the days when Tommy Lynley was engaged to Deborah (and she has not yet admitted her love for Simon, nor Simon his love for her.) The movie is set to be contemporary with the other stories, with Tommy engaged to Helen. Other than that confusion, the adaptation is well done, capturing Tommy's tension with his mother and her gentleman friend. And, of course, there is the obligatory murder with its investigation and aftermath."
1,VERY LACKLUSTER PERFORMANCE,"I'm a big fan of Zappa and especially enjoy his live work. This recording is WAY below average for two reasons... 1) Recording quality is abyssmal 2) Performance is unemotional.If you want the real ""Live"" magic try ""Live in New York"", ""Roxy and Elsewhere"", and ""The Best Band You Never Heard in Your Life"".With the last being the best IMHO."
4,Beautiful,"This is a folksy Appalachian poem about the end of the day and how the countryside and farm animals and children are getting ready for night time.. example: ""Katydids argue: 'Katydid! Katydidn't!' Cicadas fiddle on, but they all stay hidden."" The illustrations are absolutely beautiful. Just a beautiful book with a rhyme and simple story line that will lull you to dreamland."
2,Disappointed,"I eagerly bought this DVD and the book Yoga Tradition of Unification and am disappointed with both. I cannot see why Andrey is called an influencial yoga teacher. Not saying that his yoga postures are bad because he definately has ability for advanced postures but the style is very strange and the average person will not be able to perform them and without personal instruction, could hurt themselves. The book is a big disappointment with many parts that just seem like jiberish."
4,Good space-saving combo,"I have what I think may be an earlier model of this tv/vcr combo since mine doesn't have the V-chip and the remote control is different. Other than that it's the same thing. I've had mine for about five years now and am quite satisfied with it. One handy feature mine has is called ""Nite Mode"". This mode darkens the picture to make it easier on your eyes if you're watching at night with the lights off. VCR programming is easy and intuitive.The only major improvement I'd make is to the quality of the remote as certain buttons on mine have begun to stick or not work at all. I suppose it's normal wear and tear so I got a universal remote to deal with that. Another thing I'd like is the option of a rear A/V input as opposed to having them in front because this makes for some awkward running of cables around the set. Overall it's a good value for the money if you have limited space in your home and can't afford any electronics clutter on the TV stand."
2,Very disappointed,"I ordered this book in hardcover, as a Christmas gift for my granddaughter. It arrived in paperback (and the cover was blemished) and it was too late to return it and still make Christmas. Although I did get a refund and was told to keep the book ...it still put a damper on my excited and expectations for a Christmas gift."
5,"The Wicked, Wicked Ladies in the Haunted House",Lots of fun to read! My daughter read it in one afternoon!
2,different,"this story is certainly different. an old victorian (abandoned) house-a house witha history,some bratty modern kids,a leprechaun(!),and,time travel. these things should make for a great children's story but,it really does not.the little girl of the story,maureen,goes back in time(to live with the messerman family) and this is where the story becomes unsatisfying..... there were seven daughters in themesserman family who lived there with their' parents. they were young girls andvery selfish/self absorbed,interested only in their appearance-clothes. i thinkthat this could have been explored more but,it never was. it was difficult to understand how maureendid not know that she had gone back? the end i did not care for. i think there could have been a much better story here but,it never did materialize."
2,A Forgotten Classic That Could Stand to Be Forgotten,"I'd never heard of this ""forgotten classic"" before I picked up this retitled reissue. I see now that I wasn't missing much.The story rambles and meanders. The wicked, wicked ladies seem like they could be much more wicked, though I did enjoy the way they were introduced (via a series of portraits that hang in their ruined old house). I wish there had been other little gimmicks like that in the book, to make it stand out.If you want a book about running around in an old house, I recommend Ellen Raskin's ""The Westing Game"" or ""The House With a Clock in Its Walls"" by John Bellairs. Those books will stay with you for a long time, and they warrant rereading. The wicked, wicked ladies simply don't have much to recommend them."
3,Too Advanced,I bought this game for my three year old and it is just too advanced for her at this time.
4,works well,"My petipaws broke, so I decided to get something else. This works well. This model has 2 speeds. I use the low speed, which is still muchmore powerful than the petipaws.The sound is different, than the other unit.It took a short time for my dog to adjust to this, and for me to be comfortableand smoother in my movements.I won't have to grind my dogs nails so often, now that I have this unit. I would never go back."
4,Very good.,"This is the first time using these on my dog's nails. All things considered, she cooperates well. Very good buy. I will purchase more in the future."
3,Not part of my order,"I only ordered the small size of sanders that fit my tiny toe sander for my dog. But when I got my order, the larger size was there as well. They don't fit my sander so what am i supposed to do with them? Does anyone else want them? I will sell them. Let me know.Robin"
4,Good,"This CD does a fine job of capturing the Mothers' wacky stage lunacy. The theatrical part is funny and entertaining, but you probably won't want to listen to it more than once or twice. The remainder of the concert is excellent, with lots of looney mouth sounds from the various Mothers. One complaint though: were is the singing? Usually there is no singing at all, with the melodies just being played by instruments. Also, it is a bit lacking on guitar (although Frank really rips it up on ""Orange County Lumber Truck""). But still, an excellent CD."
3,TWO DISTINCTLY DIFFERENT PERFORMANCES,"THERE ARE SOME GREAT FRANK ZAPPA/MOI BOOTLEGS OUT THERE ON THE MARKET. THIS AIN'T ONE OF THEM. RECORDED LIVE IN 1968, THE FIRST HALF OF THE ALBUM IS HORRIBLE, A LOT OF STUPID ONSTAGE THEATRICS, BUT THE SECOND HALF OF THE ALBUM, STARTING WITH TRACK 11 (KING KONG)IS MORE INSTRUMENTAL IN NATURE AND IS MUCH MORE REPRESENTATIVE OF THE OLD ORIGINAL MOTHERS'. THE RECORDING QUALITY IS NOT SO GREAT. UNEVEN OUTPUT ON THIS CD, A LOT OF IT IS GOOD, BUT SOME OF IT CAN'T EVEN BE LISTENED TO, PARTICULARLY THE FIRST HALF."
5,I LOVED IT,"Lather will blow your mind. The first track, Regyptian strut is a wah, wah march, the various array of odd percussion, keyboards and guitars are Zappas essence in his finest. Alot of the songs have the most full lyrics with songs about the beach, the devil and ofcourse nocturnal gregarious wild swines. Yes Greggary Pecary is what I'm talking about the longest most entertaining musical monologue in history. Describing the life of a strange pig, evil hunchmen and the world's greatest living ""philostepher"" with stunning musical accompliment Greggary Peccary is guarenteed to give you laughs and enjoyment galore. The other musical peices such as Revenge of the Knick Knack people and Filthy habbits are fun and dangerous. Mr. Zappa. you are god!"
5,A treasure,"This three-disc set is amazing. So much of it was familiar from the previous (and unauthorized) LPs. I wore the grooves off of these albums back in high school. It's fantastic to finally be able to listen to them again. I was so disappointed whenSleep Dirtwas re-released with those wretched vocals--what a relief to be able to hear it again after all those years. (My vinyl collection was destroyed in the 1994 Northridge Earthquake, so I've been estranged from a lot of these tunes for many many years.)Buy it, rip it to your iPod, and listen to all three discs, one after another. It will quench your thirst with FZ's finest works."
5,Läther: the way it was meant to be...,"This posthumous 3-CD release by the Zappa Family Trust - essentially, and I use that term advisedly, an amalgamation of Zappa_In_ New_York, Studio_Tan, Sleep_Dirt, and Orchestral_Favorites (...and yes, all 4 albums are worth purchasing even if one already owns Läther. Or vice versa, as the case may be) - is how Frank Zappa originally intended the aforementioned records to be heard. Unfortunately, due to a dispute with Warner Bros., his grandiose scheme of releasing an ""8-sided album"" was quashed. Therefore, in December 1977, Zappa went on a local radio station, told the audience to get their recording equipment ready, whereupon he broadcast the album, in its entirety to an unexpecting public. Some sound bites of the (inebriated?) ""bogus temporary DJ"" are interspersed within this remastered album. The liner notes, a 38-page booklet, includes synopses of the songs contained therein. An unequivocal masterpiece by a true visionary genius!"
4,Keep coming back for inspiration,"Some coffee table books about cabins are so glamorous that they are completely useless. This book is a good guide to the different styles and shapes a waterfront property can take. There are some pricey properties, but they are done in a way that takes the land around it into account. The author even discusses how to make your property live within its environment.The photography for the properties is thorough and beautiful. It gives inspiration and ideas.The accompanying text is well received as well. It explains why certain things work and why they don't. It is in my top five for cabin related books."
1,useless,"The Hakuba LB 810 light box is useless without a plug in. Your ad states it can be used with ac or batteries - the batteries are not included. It does not state anything about an ac cord or adapter as not included. When I checked about the adapter-it stated it was not available. How am I to use a light box without a plug in. Don't tell me to use the batteries. The light box takes 6 Ds and they are heavy. Besides,most electronic devices use batteries or can be pluged in. It may be going back. Tom Buonomo"
4,GOOD,Im a benginer on movie making and my cast and crew agred that I needed some lighting for night..so i look around and saw this...only I can not hang it from the tops of trees or cielings so what im i supposd to do???????
4,Journey Through Time,"Not only is this movie amazing, so is the soundtrack. I read Orlando in one sitting, and immeadiatly saw the movie and watched it twice in a row. The sound adds so much to the movie. Even if I didn't like the movie I would definatly dig this soudtrack. I highly reccomend this CD!"
5,Went back to the theatre to LISTEN to the movie the next day,"When the lights came up after ""Coming"" blew me away I sat there stunned. My friends patiently waited for me as I recovered. The next day I went back to a matinee showing and sat in the almost empty theatre drinking in the sound of this film. The soundtrack is absolutely wonderful! I relive the movie in part when I listen to it. I had a roommate when this movie came out who bought the CD and he fell asleep to it every night for a month. Some of the transitions on the soundtrack are a wee bit abrupt, but no more so than other soundtracks (better in fact than a lot) I've worked ""Coming"" into my DJ sessions and always get great comments. Well worth owning if you liked the movie."
3,Necessary Glasses Glasses,"This item fits over your glasses well, but it is a little bulky. However, I think it goes with the turf. Good protection."
2,Not enough laughs,"I waited from this book to find funny stories about dancers from all over the world but there were just few stories that really were funny. Book was filled with stories by Jodette and Dallal, of which the first was really boring: maybe it was fun to live that life but for sure it was not fun to read... and what has the last story about Prince fan do in this book? There could have been so much more to read if the author was more concentrating to really fun and interesting stories instead of dropping famous names."
3,Excellent at first; shedding aluminum particles after 2 years,"This squeezer feels very solid and worked well for me at first. It effectively squeezes the juice out of limes. To get all the juice out it takes two maneuvers: first, squeeze half a lime with the cut side down. Then fold the squeezed lime in half and squeeze again.""What on earth is in my lime juice??""I peered into my glass and wondered where all the dark particles might be coming from. Not from the lime!! I didn't mind when the non-stick finish wore off, after a few months of use. But now the aluminum is flaking off, after about two years of daily use. This morning I tossed my trusty squeezer into the trash, with a twinge of sadness. I have ordered a stainless steel squeezer of another brand as a replacement, with the hopes that it will last longer and be more hygenic. It is regrettable that Oxo does not manufacture this product from longer lasting materials. Citrus juice eats through aluminum."
3,Meh,"This think works ok, except when the pin in the hinge falls out and you have to use pliers and a hammer to put it back in."
2,Limes only...,"This item is incredible for juicing limes. It does such a wonderful job and gets every last drop. However, it is horrible for juicing lemons. It is sad because if it was labeled as a lime juicer only, I would give it 5 stars. Then again, I probably wouldn't buy it if it was labeled as just a lime juicer."
4,"very good juicer, ridiculous packaging","Great for limes and lemons, too big for key limes. I got this to replace one of the enameled ones after all the enamel started flaking off. I believe the clear anodized finish will last much longer. This juicer came alone in a box the size of a litter box though, completely wasteful packaging."
3,"Decent, but could be better.","I believe this is the same Oxo model I picked up at a local store. It extracts lemon or lime juice fairly well, but I have two complaints:1. Longer handles would be helpful to provide better leverage;2. The anodized aluminum surface picks up a difficult to clean visible residue each time it is used to squeeze lemons or limes. The odor stays on the press even after washed with vinegar and baking soda. I believe a stainless steel press might be better in this regard.This is a very functional item for occasional home use but would be inadequate for heavy duty or professional service."
3,"Great for lemons, not so much for limes","Juicing limes is a pain regardless of which method you use - they just don't give up their juice as easily as other citrus fruits. I use a handheld juicing cone that fits over a bowl to juice my limes, but I decided to give this OXO squeezer a try, for limes as well as lemons.For lemons, I'd give this squeezer 4 stars. A bit of juice may spray out the sides from time to time if I press hard, but the tool is easy to use and juices lemons in no time flat. Most importantly, it extracts as much juice as the old-fashioned juicing bowl or reamer would.For limes, I'd recommend a reamer or juicing bowl. I like to get every last drop of juice I can from my limes, and this squeezer leaves quite a bit still in the fruit. Not good.Overall, this kind of tool just isn't the most effective way to juice limes. Get the squeezer for lemons, if nothing else - it will save you a lot of time and energy in the kitchen."
3,"works great for lemons, not so much for limes","I read the review of this item by Omar Siddique and immediately placed an order. For my cooking, I use about 10 times as many limes as I do lemons. But now that I've had the citrus squeezer a few months, I'm just not very happy with it for us with limes. It's got too large of a diameter for limes, and doesn't flip them inside out as it's supposed to do (and which it does just fine for lemons).I think I'll stow this one way in the back of my kitchen drawer and try a different product that is smaller and better suited for squeezing limes. I've been finding myself just squeezing limes by hand the past couple weeks, which must mean that this product just isn't providing me any value."
1,Get the more basic one instead (not made by oxo),"Let me preface this by saying that in general Oxo makes some great products. I'm a fan.This is probably one notable exception. I've owned several juicers of this type---you put the lemon in, and squeeze it out sort of like a garlic press. For some reason, Oxo's version has a little dimple upward in the lemon bowl. I'm not sure what purpose this dimple serves. Maybe it's to press out the juice more thoroughly. However, if you squeeze the juicer with any speed at all, most of the juice ends up coming out the side of the fruit holder, and not down the middle. Squeeze too fast like I just did, and juice goes everywhere. Thank god I was wearing glasses.This is NOT a problem on other juicers of this variety, only the Oxo one. The Norpro or Amco ones look like they don't have that stupid indentation. This one? It looks cool but is not suitable for bartending or other situations where you have to get the juice out fast. Stay away."
2,Not an effective juicer,"Normally, I love things from Oxo Good Grips. Their kitchen tools all seem to work well and effectively and to resolve all those little issues that other brands of tools do not. However, this juicer is the exception. I used it twice and then gave it away. I tried lemons and limes and both times it left lots of juice and pulp in the fruit. So much so that I had to take my reamer and rejuice it. This citrus squeezer is very hard to squeeze closed and even though I work out several times a week and am pretty strong ""for a girl"", I found it hard to use. I am going back to my reamer or my good old fashioed glass saucer juicer that have worked so well for so long."
5,Makes Life Easier!,"I inherited a lemon tree with my new place and lemons coming out my ears. After squeezing twenty lemons by hand I decided to buy the OXO squeezer. Wow, what a life saver. I've squeezed about a hundred lemons with this thing and it works great. The only improvement I could suggest is making it a little bigger. Some of my orange sized lemons won't fit completely inside the cup. However, I still get all the juice. Unless you get something motorized this is as good as I can imagine."
5,Great Citrus Squeezer,This is a great product. I was surprised how much more juice I can squeeze from using this device as opposed to just using my hand. Be careful about over-juidcing something. I made a broccoli juice that had way to much citrus.
4,Very Good Squeezer,"The OXO Good Grips Citrus Squeezer does an outstanding job on lemons and limes. I have wanted a squeezer since using one at my mother's house, but the ones I found in the store did not seem very sturdy. Not so with the OXO. This things seems built to last."
3,It leaves much to be desired,"The Oxo Citrus squeezer for use with lemons is quite imperfect. The problems:1. It will often spurt juice out of the sides no matter what kind of hand pressure one uses.2. It requires that you reverse or invert the fruit for a more complete extraction after the initial squeeze.3. Many lemons are too large for the bowl and must be trimmed.4. It requires a fair amount of hand strength to use without bracing it against something.Nonetheless, I use it frequently because while imperfect, it is handy and I don't know if another type would perform better."
1,My bare hands work better,"OXO is my favorite brand of utensil. What a shock to discover that they make such a lousy juicer. While the grips are fine, as OXO is known for, this juicer's utility is practically nil. After juicing either limes or lemons, and squeezing as hard as a 200 pound man can, I can still squeeze out another tablespoon out of the rind with my bare hands. I returned it to the store and I went back to my technique of slicing through the citrus pulp with an ice cream scoop and pressing the sides of the lime half together with my hands. Much more effective and less work."
3,"Sorry, OXO, you missed!",Let me just say that I'm a huge OXO fan and most of their products are spot-on but the juicer is a rather poorly designed. Its well made and sturdy but the goofy bubble in the top part really performs poorly. Save your money on this one.
1,"Oh no, OXO! This product is a lemon!","This citrus squeezer is probably fine for soft Meyer lemons. The aluminum is weak and brittle, and will eventually break--especially if you use it DAILY with tough-skinned lemons. My first one lasted perhaps 4 months before breaking. My second one didn't quite last two months. I'm very surprised, since I generally love OXO products, and (normally) find them to be of high quality. If you intend to use fresh lemon juice daily, I recommend investing in a citrus press. That's what I'm going to do!"
3,Coating peals away if used regularly,"The juicer works well and is still functioning as new after a year of regular (daily) use. So the item functions as advertized. However, the whole juicer is coated in a silver colored coating of some kind. This coating started deteriorating after about 4 months of use and after a year is mostly gone from the interior of the juicer (where the citrus comes in contact with the juicer. As I said above, this does not affect the functionality, but it doesn't make me very confident in the purity of my juice.If I were to purchase again I would go for a stainless version or a vintage aluminum model."
5,whipped through a bag of lemons and had lemon drops within the hour,I definitely think that simple=better. It has a nice handle and cup size. You can do a bunch of lemons in a snap and have cocktails ready. Now you just need a lemon tree!!
1,Not satisfactory,"Used once on the type of lime we get as a routine, medium-large, but smaller than a small lemon, it left 1/3 of the pulp unsqueezed, which I extracted with my teeth, yielding an estimated 1/4 of the juice obtained by the unit. The design looks like a hypothesis that failed. I've looked for the Ecko aluminum unit we used in Mexico, but haven't found it."
4,OXO Good Grips Citrus Sqeezer,"A good high-tech adaptation of a traditional Mexican design that has advantages over traditional citrus juicers, especially for small lemons and limes."
1,"Well made, poorly designed","It is a well made little gadget. However, the designers at OXO set out to improve the original Mexican design with the addition of a little mound in receptacle used for the lime or lemon. This actually prevents the fruit from being completely squeezed. So, while I like this little gadget, I will be buying a stainless steel one without the fancy design touches by OXO."
2,hard to use,"I bought this at linens and things a few days ago and was thinking about returning it. I have only used it for lemons, and it is very difficult to squeese and leaves a lot of wasted juice in the lemon. I think it may be more effective for my husband since he has stronger hands."
2,Did not like,"This juicer, when juicing key limes (which are small) has too large of a gap when fully compressed, leaving much of the juice and pulp unsqueezed. We came up with a workaround by stacking 2 or 3 squeezed halves together and squeezing them again. But this did not work very well. After a few minutes, I wanted to return it.Why is this? Why not form the two pieces so they fit snugly together, and let me decide how hard/much I want to squeeze a lime or lemon?I think this device would be better suited for full sized lemons, with thick rinds, and not key limes."
1,Don't Waste Your Money On This Cheap Bootleg!,"First off the film is fine low budget action/Sci Fi flick starring Blue Demon but the problem here is this cheap bootleg by EastWest Entertainment is incomplete. What's missing you ask? Why it's the ending, about the last ten minutes of the film are completely missing on this DVD so there's no point in watching this crummy version because it will leave you hanging. There is an official DVD from Mexico available which is complete of course but sadly for those of you who don't speak Spanish there aren't any subtitles available on that release same is the case with this cheap bootleg."
4,Great blower!,"Tho not as strong as the regular no-brush-head type blower, this 2 in 1 design comes quite handy still."
2,Quality of rubber material subpar,"I already use a an air blower called Giottos Rocket Air Blaster, but I wanted another one with an detachable brush, so I ordered one. Although one reviewer said it is of good quality, I deem it is of less quality compared to the Giottos. Good rubber should feel and smell like a car tyre; quality rubber should provide good grip (resistance from moving) and elasticity. IMO, the Hakuba does not. Also, because of its flatter shape, it squirts out much less air than the Giottos. Although the Giottos costs more than the Hakuba, I consider it a better product and much better value. The Giottos has three sizes, but I prefer the largest one."
5,DGA M-14 Basket,"I purchased the DMA M-14 basket based mainly on price and I am quite happy with it. It is as described, good price, light and portable. It is not the biggest, strongest basket you have ever seen but if it was, it would not be under 200 dollars and would not be easy to move. Just right for taking to the park."
4,Great for the price,"I've had one of these for two years now. It is easy to assemble and disassemble and is overall a great basket. My only complaint is disc catching. You'd have to double up on the inside circle of chains for this to catch like a pdga basket. I make about 25% less putts, but it's great for practice and a good basket for the money..."
4,Happy Father's Day,"My girls and I wanted to get my husband a fabulous Father's Day present, and that is just what happened. The basket is easily broken down for placing in our vehicle to take it wherever we feel like. The company that I did business with was great. The basket arrived when they said it would, and they treated me very well. I am always nervous about making purchases online, but this transaction was everything it should have been. Great product, good service and the end result was a Happy Father's day. I would recommend this company to anyone who wishes to be treated well while having their disc golf needs met."
4,Cha' Ching,This is a good basket for the back yard. It's fun to putt with. The fact that it only has 14 chains (as opposed to 24) will allow for some putts to blow through or bounce out but that doesn't detract from the fun. My first 1 I bought 5 years ago and it has been outside the whole time with no rust at all! I have three of them now- that in of itself is a testament to the quality and the fun.
5,Gratitude,I have been using this product for sometime now.I had spent a lot of money for years looking for a product that works.I have nothing that works even clost to the quality of this product. So I am a very satisfied customer.My thanks and god bless you.Jim W
5,Are You Liberally Educated?,"Physical chemistry is the backbone of reality and the balance ledger of the universe. For many, the only remaining question is, who cares? The answer to that is, educated people should care. Otherwise educated people or politicians must excuse their brutish ignorance by the litany, ""I wasn't good in science"". Despite the boring title, Laidler has struck a reasonable balance between deriving the Gibbs equations and fabricating a childrens book of inspiration. There are equations in the book (sorry Mr. President) but there are also diverting biographies of the colorful personalities who figured out how the world works without their needing to invent a mythical cosmogeny. Before anyone claims to have a liberal education, they should have read this book."
4,WORKED WELL FOR ME!!,"I'll agree that this item looks like a gimmick, but after having actually used it, I had no problems with this tool. It is set up to give you 16"" on center, and it works well if you use it properly. True, I probably would not use it to build an entire house, but it works better than most people think. It saves a lot of time in the long run."
5,Why didn't I know about this sooner?,I have built many walls while mumbling under my breath how miserable it was lining studs. A list here on Amazon led me to this tool and I ordered it immediately.
2,Why Junk,"I'm a do-it-your selfer,FrameMaster would help me in building a simple wall like a divider ect.If I needed a house built and a Framer showed up with FrameMaster I would question their ability."
1,Pure Junk,What kind of idiot would buy something like this? Not me. If I showed up with one of these my crew would laugh me off the job site.
1,bad choice,this is not a production tool it does not fit studs and only does one at a time this tool is a joke.
5,Firefighting Strategies and Tactics,I think this is a wonderful book. It kept me spellbound for hours.
4,Fun Deck,"The Fairy Tarot is a fun and lovely deck; since fairies are the focus, it is a great deck to tie in with nature and animals. I was only a little disappointed to find the hearts, bells, acorns, and leaves just printed on each card with the fairy drawing instead of incorporated into the actual drawing. I was pleased to find the accompanying booklet! It helps! The meanings vary some since it is a fairy focus. If you are looking for an entertaining, pretty deck, then you will enjoy this one."
4,Fear thy father/love thy martyr,"Ok, so many people seem to think that not only is this album weaker than ""What it is to burn"" but they seem to think the album is just ok at best (in general). I actually see it as better than WIITB. The band moved awway from some of their more emo-ish song writing and incorporated more varied tastes. A bit converge-light on ""The Casket of Roderick Usher"" Some jazz-meets-rock on ""A Man Alone"" and more soaring choruses akin to their own earlier song ""What it is to burn"". Give it more than one chance, as some music needs to grow, or like another reviewer, give it time on your shelf then pick it up again in later months, it might appeal more as you broaden your musical horizon. (and i only gave it four stars because five is reserved for a few special albums most recently Thrice-Vhiessu and Sigur Ros-Takk)"
3,"good, but different","Ever since What It Is To Burn came out, Finch has been my all time favorite band. I have listened to that CD almost daily. At one point I was counting down the days until this new CD came out. I went and bought it the day it came out and sadly, I was disappointed. I'm not saying the CD is bad because it definitely isn't. I like the CD just it sounds different from the band that I fell in love with. I'll still listen to this CD but not as much as Finch's debut album. If you want a really good album, buy What It Is To Burn.The songs on Say Hello To Sunshine that stand out to me are Revelation Song, Ink, and Bitemarks and Bloodstains."
2,What happened guys??,"I was so excited when this album came out since I hadn't heard anything new by Finch in a while. ""what it is to burn"" is one of my most favorite cds, So naturally i had high expectations for ""Say Hello to Sunshine"". One word: AWFUL! What happened guys?? I love it when bands mix up their sounds and try something new, but it just isn't working with these guys. I even tried to convinced that I like it, but it's just not working. Looks like it's going to sit on the shelf and collect dust!"
3,Slightly Dissapointing,"Honestly, I was more than a little excited when I heard about this album coming out, and after playing it, I am dissapointed. I follow the motto if it aint broke, don't fix it. Bottom line, ""What it is to Burn"" was an amazing album, and this album falls far from that marker. Not to say the album isn't ok, but thats really all it deserves. My favorite song is the first song on the cd, and in my past experience, I find that on average, when that is the case, the cd does not impress. Of course, it's all relative. If this were a new band, and I had not previously heard ""What it is to Burn,"" I would undoubtedly have a different opinion, but needless to say, I had high standards going in."
1,"The joke is over, right?","Where did Finch go? Oh yes, the new, trendy ""thing to do"" within the encompassing rock genre, ""Let's reinvent ourselves!"" NO! Bad trend, bad idea, bad album! Finch definitely did not sell out. In fact, ""What It Is To Burn"" is probably more poppish than this album. ""Worms...."" had to give one the feeling that Finch were leaning towards an edgier, darker sound. But you know what, I want Finch to sound like Finch, I want Glassjaw to sound like Glassjaw, and for the love of God I want Incubus to sound like Incubus. Oh well, to each his own!"
1,worst sophomore album of all time,"Finch follows up an original, catchy, widely popular album with a colossal piece of crap. I agree with the remark that this album sounds INCREDIBLY like Incubus' ""Morning View""...except it doesn't even come close to being on par with Morning View cause they have all the harcore screamo crap thrown in. There are a certain percentage of people out there who consider themselves ""hardcore"" who will embrace this album because its a different move for Finch but honestly if I wanted to liste to growling hardcore Finch is not the band im listening to. Finch was well liked for their poppy heartfelt cheesy lyrics and they'll never be a hardcore band...now they just suck"
3,dissapointed...,"to me this was the most anticiapted album of 2005, once i heard what it is to burn, i instantly fell in love with this group and purchased myself the CD...and they quickly became one of my favorite bands...i'm not saying this CD is horrible, it has it's share of decent songs, but nothing even close to their previous album, i am giving this 3 stars and i'm being generous...i was truly disapointed listening thru it.."
2,Review from the Synthesis,"The vindictive allure of a group whose nonconformity clashes with their lack of innovation never ceases to sell records. That being said, it's no surprise that Finch's latest offering, Say Hello to Sunshine, is full of derivative and mostly heartless drivel. Moments of clarity only peak out in the beginning tracks like the urgent opus ""Revelation Song,"" but the rays of light are few and far between. Electronic manipulations flanked by hook-heavy guitar thuds and rampant screaming only serves to validate a clear sense of indecision on the part of the group. Regardless, I'm sure there are more than enough Finch fans who'll find diamonds in the rough here, I'm just not one of them.- Ryan PradoSynthesis.net"
2,PLEASE READ,"After listening to and LOVING What it is to Burn i bought this album without a second thought. My reaction when I put it in my CD player: ""Huh?"" .... How could they follow up such an amazing CD with this garbage? Im currently on my like 3rd listen through still trying to find a song or two to justify my purchase, but no luck so far.Please at least preview the songs on this album before buying it, there is no need to throw your money away. I rarely write reviews but I feel obligated to make an attempt to save everyone that I can.Buy What it is to Burn. Leave Say Hello to Sunshine on the shelf."
1,i'm a naysayer,"Anything that you have to try really, REALLY hard to listen to, isn't worth listening to in the first place. Metalcore gives me a headache. i hate you, finch."
5,awesome new sound,"Ok, I have read a bunch of reviews on this new Finch cd, and I give props to the ones who recognize it's maturation and progression. The shallow reviews, you guys shouldn't waste your time... anyways, this is an awesome sophomore effort by Finch. Nate's singing is more intense, and the band varies from song to song. And it is good that it sounds different from What it is to Burn ,cuz i dont want to hear a dupilacate of that cd. Good going guys... other bands who are alike Finch: Thrice"
4,Progress with a smile!,"Finch, FInch, Finch. Now, when ""What it is to burn"" came out, I liked it. It was new to me. Over the last 4 years I have progressed thanks to bands such as The Mars Volta, Rush, At The Drive-In,and the Pixies. This cd fits in perfect with my ratation of prog/alt. music. The timing changes along with the lovely melodies makes me think of Incubus, but with an emo twist. Overall, if you like progressive music with a bit of catchiness, check this cd out. Otherwise, buy The Starting lines new Cd (Their new one is good and I hate myself for liking it.). ""Say Hello to Sunshine"" is for the open hearted/minded. Enjoy"
4,Glassjaw meets Faith No More well kinda....,"I have listened to this album about 4-5 times now. When I first heard it I was a bit disappointed, I knew it was not going to sound like What it is to burn, but the change was so radical it just shocked me. After a few listens I recognized how good of a rock album this is.Although this album in my opinion is very unique, for those that want an idea of what to expect I would say take the raw aggresive sound from Glassjaw's Worship and tribute mixed with a singing style in between Glassjaw, Older Finch and that of Faith no More from the Album King for a Day.Music is no longer pop-punk, this is a pure bread rock album."
2,4 years for this........,"I honestly didnt think finch would take this turn. Well anyways there is two or three good songs on the cd, and those songs are mediocre at best. Most of the song sound awkward, guitars sound......i dont know how to say this...like crap. The cd sounds like they put it together in a matter of days, and not 4 years. There is no harmony/melody, its just a bunch of random sounds that dont make any sense and they dont go together. If you liked the first one, more than likely you wont like this one. I would not buy this cd again, its not worth it. The cd would be better if nate wouldnt have taken a different direction with his voice."
5,"Hello Sunshine, Good-bye Sophomore Curse","Finch's second full-length release, Say Hello To Sunshine, in many ways outshines 2002's What It Is To Burn. Already one of my favorite bands, Finch does not disappoint with this album. Stand-out tracks include ""Brother Bleed Brother,"" ""Ink,"" ""Reduced To Teeth,"" and ""A Man Alone."" Finch seem to be shying away from their more ""pop-""orientated musicology from their former album; instead, trudging through with more complex, often harder instrumentation. Personally, it is also satisfying to see their bassist (Derek Doherty) playing a larger role, as in the intro riff for ""Fireflies."" If you are expecting Finch, this is definitely something different. But different isn't always bad."
2,Close but no cigar,This album is a step up for Finch but all in all falls very short of even being decent. They need to dump this emo crap or move outa the way.
2,Flunking out Sophmore year?,"I grew up listening to punk and over the last couple of years have sort of fallen into the ""scremo"" scene. I really enjoyed Finch's first album WIITB and their LP. The fast rifs and screamo chorus worked awsome together. My little cousin sent me WIITB when I was deployed during OIF I and it was the perfect album to to get psyched to when in the gym or rolling out on missions. In their seoncd album, Finch has completely altered their sound and lost the hard edge that I found so appealing. The angry and emotional lyrics that were so cool on the first album have been replaced by annoying whines and whispers. Bottom line: Finch is no longer the in-your-grill rockers that they once were and this album was a big let down. Check out the band Rise Against for some good new school punk tunes with a screamo edge."
2,CAN I LIVE?,"What happened to Finch?! Do not buy this album cuz it is NOTHING like ""What It Is To Burn"". Pretty disappointed :("
2,Not as good at all,"Ever since WIITB came out, i was instantly hooked on the cd. Ever since 2002 ive been listening to the album. And when the second album, SHTS came out, i ran to the store and bought it, expecting to be blown away. But, i was extremely dissapointed. With the exception of ""Ink"" (the only reason i gave this 2 stars) this cd is terrible. Nothing else to say."
1,FINCH...,"One star for one good track and a nice album cover. Sounds like every other trendy emo/punk/boy band. No sign of creativty or even direction in these 14 tracks. Finchs' music has taken a turn for the worst, If you own Incubus' ""a crow left the murder"" just listen to that cuz it sounds exactly the same. The bands first LP was so good that I just bought ""Say Hello to Sunshine"" without even hearing a song and I have regretted it since... Anyway for you FINCH fans dont judge and book by its cover. Listen to your friends copy or on itunes or just download some track and save some money."
2,"""this is the worst thing that you have ever done!""","I tried very hard to like this cd. I just couldnt admit that Finch made a cd that I didnt like. I loved what it is to burn and I was happy to hear that they made some changes so that they would not sound like all the other screamo bands that copied finch. Changing their sound was a great idea, but they did not go in the right direction. This cd has some screamo influence (mostly glassjaw) but most of this cd sounds like mainstream metal bands such as slipknot, incubus, sevendust, system of a down, disturbed (ironic since finch and disturbed once had a fight becasue finch said disturbed's music was terrible). I can understand changing your sound because a thousand bands copy you but by doing so...they copied a thousand bands....they went from being copied to copying. Not to mention they picked some of the most horrible bands to rip off. some songs arent as bad but I can't get into this cd."
2,Not worth the wait,"This album is one of the biggest disappointments I've known. This is not the band that I fell in love with. Their sound has completely altered from ""What it is.."" and not for the better I may add. Some people say this change is for the better, yet how can it be when a very, very large portion of their fans are left in the dust?You will not find anything remotely like...Letters to youPerfection through silencePostscriptStay with meWithout you hereWhat it is to burn (demo ver.)WaitingBury meApologetic theoryEnder...on this new album. This is almost an entirely different band."
1,where did the feeling go?,"This was by far the most dissapointing CD I have ever purchased. Finch's ""What it is to Burn"" album was so great that I expected this one to be even better. ""Say Hello to Sunshine"" was an all around bad album. There were a couple good tracks, but I still had to force myself to hear this CD all the way through. This new Finch sound just doesn't flow right. Their music and lyrics have lost the feeling that made their ""What it is to Burn"" album so extraordinary. I hope we see the old Finch in their next album."
1,Don't understand how anyone could really like this.,"Crap. Absolute crap. I really liked their last album. I wanted to like this album. Listened to some songs several times trying to like them, but couldn't find a single song I thought was very good. Bitemarks & Bloddstains was the closest they came. The guitar on this sounds horrible, no power behind it. The lyrics a re crap. I like vague lyrics, i think the Deftones are great, I think they tried a little to hard to be vague and original & ended up with crap.On a side note I don't understand how someon could compare this nu-metal. Is the new thing to do compare anything you don't like to nu-metal. This CD doesn't approach metal, not even nu-metal."
1,Crap,"Finch made an amazing record in 2002 with ""What it is to burn"". This album is much different. They ditched the pop-punk hooks and went for a sound similar to Faith No More. In my opinion finch is trying too hard to sound different, the songs are terrible. The recording sounds way too flat, sounds like they didn't want it to sound overproduced. Don't waste your money on this album."
1,Say *Hello* To Garbage,"I was pretty impressed with finch's debut ""what it is to burn"". It was a good mix of punk/rock/hxc and techno. I'll be the first to admit that I've never been a fan-boy for this band, but I did enjoy their music enough to buy ""say hello to sunshine"".After listening to the first two songs, I was ready to throw it out my car window. I understand that bands like to change, but if you're going to completely redo your music, you should change the name of your band as well.Change can be good, sometimes. Finch is one of those bands however that just cannot pull it off. I can't imagine they'll be keeping too many fans with this crap.If you enjoyed the debut, buy with caution. I'd almost suggest going into this record as if it were a completely different band, fronted by nate. That way, your expectations won't be letdown. Don't think so? I promise that if you even half way liked the debut, you'll *hate* ""say hello to sunshine""."
4,say hello to finch's new album,"Finch's latest effort, ""Say Hello to Sunshine,"" is considerably darker and heavier than their other works. ""Say Hello to Sunshine"" is obviously Finch's own, rather than the Glassjaw-injected ""What It Is to Burn"" album which was released in 2002. With songs inspired by Poe's ""Fall From the House of Usher,"" among other literay works, this album is a must have for all hardcore/screamo fans."
3,Not impressive.,"I'll say that this is not a bad CD, but there are so many things that make it difficult to listen to. The biggest thing to me is the recording quality. The guitar tone is total crap, with no punch, and makes the songs seem really dead. If there was a powerful hitting tone, think of how much harder the beginning of the song Piece of Mind could be. It just seems really sloppy in that retrospect. If you're looking for the same finch that released What It Is to Burn than you will be disspointed. If you can accept that they're different, than you may like it. Look at is as just the music, and not music by Finch, and decide for yourself."
5,"Sorry emo boys and girls, Emo is in critical condition","Well the people who rated this CD a 1 star or low stars apparently still listen to there 8th grade pop...Finch did not want to do that...this album is one of the best ive heard...there is not any other band out there that sounds like this CD...although you may not like it the first few times through, if you play in a band and listen to the elements of the song, they will blow you away. Top songs on the CD are definately Ink, Fireflies, A Man Alone, Ravenous, The Casket of Roderic Usher, and my personal favorite Dreams of a Psilocybin.If you emo boys or girls are looking for what it is to burn 2, listen to puss bands like taking back sunday, senses fail, or the used. Definately my highest anticipated album next to THE TRANSPLANTS HAUNTED CITITES OUT JUNE 21"
2,Tricked =(,"Hey, this is my first review. Last night I was watching TV and saw the video for ""Bitemarks and Bloodstains"" and I was like ""Wow, Finch has a new CD"". I liked the song so I went to the website and then it played ""Ink"" and I was like ""this is pretty good"". So now I go the album and I listened to ""Ink"" and ""Bitmarks and Bloodstains"" then I went on to all the other songs and I was like ""Wait? What is this (...)?"" Everything was almost the same and I hated all of it. I'm just finishing up listening to the album right now and I'm almost falling asleep it's so boring but I can't because there is too much annoying yelling. I can't listen to this anymore."
5,My opinion.,"Well,I was waiting for this CD to come out for a while actually.Then I got it, day one! Was hella excited.I put it in, and it was different.It wasn't like the first CD.Finch has changed. Although I love their old stuff, their new stuff is excellent as well. It is darker and more grown up.Everyone changes.Change is good"
2,how is this a new boundary?,"after reading these reviews, those that bring up things like ""a great new sound"" or ""theyre no longer emo"" is all a bunch of bs. for one finch was never emo so dont even bring that up if you want emo look at get up kids. second, they had a unique sound and this new album is not unique. you can look through lists and lists of hardcore bands and find crap like this everywhere. it is nothing new. another thing, this is not maturing to go into this darker crap, it is more emo now than it was before if you think that way with all the complaining in this album. one of the things that made what it is to burn such a good thorough album is that it had a wide variety of everything. this album is simply boring and repetitive. that is my piece"
2,A great disappointment,"I've been reading a lot of reviews while suffering through this tragedy of an album, and it seems like the reasoning behind the people who actually rated it well goes something like this: ""I've always loved Finch, Finch is cool! All my friends like Finch too, so this album rocks! I've only listened to the sample clips on the website, and they didn't seem that great but they were only clips anyway so I love this CD!"" Once you sift through and discard all those crappy impressionable-twelve-year-old reviews, you find that nobody really has anything good to say about this album at all. I don't blame them."
2,I'm so disappointed,"I'm not sure what kind of feedback Finch got to What It Is To Burn to put out this sort of follow up album.To be honest, there was hardly a song I could connect with in some way. The entire album seemed to be made to make my ears grate. ""Brother Bleed Brother"" is a good song, but very unlike What It Is To Burn, I just couldn't find a place to stop and love life.I'm...let down."
2,"""maturing"" as a band","So I'm guessing that their third CD will have a country sound...Don't worry though, they'll be ""maturing as a band""."
2,This is not the same band.,"I am in the same boat as everyone who has listened to their previous album and still can't get enought of every song on it.Say Hello to Sunshine was easily my most anticipated album in a long time. Every song I had heard from Finch had been amazing, but this album truly is a dissapointment. I honestly cannot believe this is the same band who put out What it is to Burn.After listening to this album 5 times all the way through on my way to work, I have given up on it. I can't imagine a scenario when I would ever listen to anything on this album again.You can say change is good and the band has matured, but I have to disagree. All I can think of when I listen to this allbum is cookie cutter Nu-Metal circa year 2000. Nothing on this album shows originality or maturity. Hopefully Finch will listen to the fans and make up for this on their next album and go back to the original sound that we know and love."
4,Say hello to sunshine,"After a two year lapse of any new material, Finch finally came out with their second full length cd, ""Say Hello To Sunshine."" Wrapping up from what it is to burn, Finch came in with a totally new music style. They have gone from a slightly dark punk band in ""What it is to Burn"", into a big screamo music style which is seen in ""Say Hello To Sunshine."" At first I did not enjoy the new style that Finch has brought to the table, but after a while I have grown to like the cd. There are some songs that I still do dislike but overall the cd is pretty good, not as good to me though as ""What it is to Burn"" was. Overall it was a good investment but I would say that if you could get it burned from a friend, then do that."
4,"different, but still the shit","I was really hoping for something very similar to their first album, but I didn't get it. At first listen I was dissapointed because it wasn't as poppy as expected. After a few listens I decided that this is just plain and simple awesome rock record. I think most people giving this a bad review can't handle stuff that doesn't have a super catchy chorus. If you thrive on pop records, just say no, but if you want a quality rock cd purchase this."
3,I miss What it is to Burn...,"Alright well when I first got this cd I was excited because I thought it was going to be awesome. Well it kind of was. It still does not even compare to ""What it is to burn"". That cd is just amazing. The first time I heard it, I fell in love with it. This cd is alright, I really like the songs ""Insomniatic Meat"" and ""Bitemarks and Bloodstains"". They're probably my favorites; as for the other ones, yeah they're alright. But could be better. I was looking forward to more screaming, because I'm into that kind of stuff. But hey this is just a reveiw, so you don't have to take my advice. But my overall outlook on this cd is that it deffinately could have been better. What it is to Burn still rules over all!"
1,The change in sound is not the problem ...,"... bad songwriting is the problem. This pathetic collection sounds like something from the bottom of the Glassjaw reject bin. There is not one song on here worth listening to more than once (that even proved to be too much). Their last CD wasn't bad, and I'm all for changing styles if it can be done with proficiency. However, all that happened here is that Finch has shown us all that they have very little talent."
1,"If you're a Finch fan, don't buy this album","Being such a hardcore fan of Finch (especially ""What it is to Burn""), I must truly admit what a disappointment this album is. Gone are the days of ear-grabbing riffs, mind-blowing melodies and tear-jerking lyrics...i.e. everything that made us love Finch in the first place. If they were looking to harness the next revolutionary/evolutionary progression of their music, they failed misserably and come off (in this album) as an Incubus ""Morning View"" ripoff, with overdone screamo to hide their lack of effort. I can't encourage you enough to buy ""What it is to Burn"" and really get a knack for this band...but in the mean time, save your 15 bucks and invest it manure...cause at least it smells better than this."
1,Faith No More Wannabes,"I bought a ticket to a Finch show before I ever heard the band. Only because a good band, Rx Bandits, is opening up for them. So, I thought I'd pick up Finch's CD so I'd have an idea who I was going to see. Can anybody say ,""Cheap Faith No More rip off?"" Like a thousand bands before them, (Korn, Incubus, etc.)Finch has stolen Mike Patton's signature sound and bastardized it. This time under the mask of whiny emo-punk. Save your money and buy the ""Real Thing"". Don't waste it on these unoriginal phonies. Myself, I'll be walking out the doors before Finch ever hits the stage."
2,wtf finch,"i feel terrible writing this about Finch, cause i love them i think that ""Falling Into Place"" and ""What It Is To Burn"" were awesome cds, even songs I've just randomly downloaded off the net by them such as ""Frail"", ""Apologetic Theory"", and ""Bury Me"", those cds and songs are what make Finch. What happen to them during this new album release? This cd is so boring and absolutely no songs stand out, I could barely tell when one song ended and the next started. Songs like ""The Casket of Roderic Usher"" don't even have the right to exist, thank the gods that song was only 1m 50s, cause its absolutely pointless. You will not find who you think is Finch in this record, be warned."
3,Not Too Impressed,"Finch's old album (What it is to Burn) was raved about when it was first released even though it sounded a lot like most other screamo bands that were all the rave at the time. But for the most part, i still enjoyed the old album (4 stars).I figured the band would grow, develop, and so forth with time. So when 3 years went by and they finally got around to releasing another album, i had pretty high expectations. But their new album to me just plain sounds boring. There isnt one track on the new album that really stands out as an ingenious piece.They did however tend to break away from the traditional verse, chorus, transition way of constructing tracks, but it just all sounds like filler to me.The new album sounds like a alien ant farm/finger eleven colaboration. Which is super if you like those bands; but i dont."
1,"If you liked What it is to burn, DON'T WASTE YOUR $$","Finch's new album is a complete departure from there previous album. I had extremely high hopes for this album, and I am very disappointed. I just don't get how they could have spent soo long writing this ablum, and STILL make it suck so bad. There guitar tone is gone, catchy hooks are a thing of the past, and they must have drank a whole bunch of suck juice. Seriously - DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!! I bought it for $10 bucks...and I want it back.If you want an awesome ablum....buy What it is to burn."
2,Dremel Brush 443,"This Brush is not a good as the other 2 Carbon Steel Brush bits, the end is to compact for the use I wanted, i.e. polishing stones. I have no doubt it would be good for other applications."
2,Overpriced - go here instead,"These are great wheels, as long as you don't want one to last more than about two minutes. That is why I started looking around, and found a place on the web called Widgetsupply.com. There I discovered I could buy 100 of these, with two mandrels thrown in, for under six dollars. In different grits and any size, if I wanted to. I recently told my dog groomer, who was going through a pack of these per dog, using the Dremel brand. They switched immediately. I don't see any difference, and I use them in various places in my wood shop, especially in guitar building and repair.One other little trick on the mandrels. The rubber gets hot and the drum will slip after a while on the rubber. Take it apart, and slip a miniature O-ring, (available at most hardware stores for pennies), onto the shaft, put back on the rubber on the shaft, put on a drum, tighten the screw and it is like new. The O-ring is usually found in places like Ace or other good hardware stores."
2,Does the job - for a little bit,"These sanding bands are great - for a little while. They just don't last for very long and are hard to find and over priced. If you need them, you need them - just be aware of the down side."
3,mistaken purchase,"I purchased a dremel for trimming our greyhounds nails, and couldn't find in the description whether there were any sanding bands in the package, so I went by what other folks had ordered when purchasing this item. Turns out, they were the wrong size, and there were bands in the package."
4,"DREMEL 1/4"" SANDING BANDS","Ordered with dremel, but cannot use because it does not fit with the pet dremel that I ordered. I think it needs a different top to which to attach. Not sure what to do to get the adaptor. IT IS OF NO USE RIGHT NOW until I can figure out how to change from the 1/2"" to 1/4"". If anyone knows what I need to get and where I can get it, please let me know. Thank you."
4,they word,these work just fine. i use them to file dogs nails and they do the job. will buy again when needed
4,Good Product!,A six pack to go! Works well with my Dremel 7300-PT 4.8 volt grinder for regular maintenance of my pet's nails.
1,Don't make this same purchase mistake!,"On 08/06/2008, I purchased these sander bands at the same time I purchased the Dremel 750-02 Minimite 13,000 RPM 2 Speed 4.8-Volt Cordless Rotary Tool. However the sander bands do not fit this tool. Amazon's Web-site did not clearly state otherwise.MCox, San Diego, CA"
4,dremel product,Same as in the store but they are not available in my area anymore so I have to buy them on line
5,MORE MONDO PSYCHOTRONIC MIND WARPING FROM JOHNNY LEGEND,"Take a low budget 1960 exploitation film about dope smugglers, throw in a couple dozen bizarre juvenile delinquent trailers and an insane introduction by host Johnny Legend, and you've got Deadly Doubles Vol. 1 - Naked Youth / Teen Mania. Fix yourself a rum & coke, grab a pack of smokes and settle in for two bizarre hours of cinemania. (For those who care, though it shows some wear, the print quality is razor sharp)"
3,Greenies are wonderful for dogs however these are overpriced,"We rescued a Shepard and her teeth aren't in real good shape. So, we thought in addition to other things we are doing, Greenies would be excellent (my Saint loves them). And they are excellent. However these are way overpriced. I don't know why I didn't realize it when I bought them, for some reason I thought there were going to be more. Anyway, I will continue to buy, but not here."
5,I loved this book!,"This is an exciting novel that really made me care about the characters and also become interested in the Titanic mystery. The compelling story draws one of it's strengths from the ease with which the author goes from the present to the era of the Titanic. I liked her stye of writing, which made it easy to forget the time and keep turning pages."
5,Captain's Karma,"This book grabbed me right away. I especially like the way the author would go from one time to another. The Titanic history is so interesting, and brings out a lot of things that aren't generally known. I do hope this author is successful with the sale of this book, which will encourage her to write more historical novels. I really enjoy historical novels and hope there are more."
4,Billy the Mountain is enough reason to buy this CD.,"While this CD does contain a seemingly endless collection of intrusive and often oppressive tape recorded snippets from life with the Mothers on the road, this CD is still a MUST for Zappa fans. Why? Three words: Billy the Mountain. This epic half-hour-long tune will take you on a musical journey alonside Billy (an actual mountain) and his wife Ethel (a tree growing out his side) as they spread havoc across America, on their way to New York to collect royalties for all the postcards they's unknowingly posed for. Musically, it is vintage early-70s Zappa, with Flo and Eddie wailing over Frank's bizarre chord progressions and unpredictable rythms, making for a wild, but compelling, musical ride. Billy the Mountain in concert is an experience that is well worth sifting through the less-inspiring content on this CD."
3,Zappa's 62nd release - get the other 61 FIRST,"Or you're bound to be disappointed. Well, let's not exaggerate - have at least 40 Zappa albums in your collection before you think of getting this one. It's more of historical interest and won't be something you put on at parties, unless you want an early evening. Otherwise, for the fan it can be interesting to listen to, although some parts more than others, in particular the historic performances mentioned by reviewers below. Other parts you may not want to publicly admit you listen to."
3,A flashback to the 1970-71 Mothers,"A taste of one of the better Mothers line-ups, it certainly captures some of the frenetic lifestyle pace of a popular, touring band. While it is fun, musicially, there's not much to offer, simply because most of the disk is dialogue. So while I am a true Zappa fanatic, the truth is that this one doesn't get spun very often.If you enjoy the ""Flo and Eddie"" era of the Mothers (as I do), or if ""200 Motels"" is your cup of tea and you want more of the same, you should have this album. But in the final analysis, this two-disc set is a substandard representation of the musical genius of one of the most innovative composers of our time."
1,Pointless really ...,"I admire Zappa but this release has got to be the single worst thing he put out. He covered the whole 'life on the road' ad nauseum throughout his long career (including the Flo & Eddie line-up documented here, but more creatively & musically way-back with them in the early 70s with the '200 Motels' double album & movie. With this set, originally issued in 1992, it's like he's going over really old turf again and it's nothing fresh, enlightening or special at all. In fact, it's unfunny, tiring & a real indulgent snoozefest. We've seen & heard most of the stuff presented here before along time ago essentially; the dialog, the themes, the little music presented...including the few Lennon/Yoko live tracks which aren't magical (or even good), and Yoko's unmusical yelping & wailing is annoying."
2,The dregs of the dregs,"To be kind, this album gives insight into how Zappa worked and has a few interesting cuts on it. To be honest, Plaground Psychotics is the dregs of the dregs."
1,Utter Trash.,"When a friend and I first got into Zappa we went nuts and between the two of us probably had close to fifty or sixty of his albums. Unfortunately, this was one that my friend purchased. He was [mad] to say the least. This piece of [crud] was promptly sold after a few days. There is just nothing here of ANY interest to ANYONE. Dull, self-indulgent, and pointless. Most importantly, NO MUSIC as I remember it. And who wants to listen to random ramblings over the course of two cd's? Ouch. Pass."
3,Playground Psychotics,"I'm not a big Frank Zappa Fan. I give this three stars just because there is something I love. The only tracks that would pass are: Well, Say Please, Scumbag, and A Small Eternity With Yoko Ono. The rest of the songs on the album fail. Here are those credits...Well (A.K.A. Well (Baby Please Don't Go): written by Walter WardSay Please (A.K.A. Jamrag): written by John Lennon and Yoko OnoScumbag: written by John Lennon, Yoko Ono, and Frank ZappaA Small Eternity With Yoko Ono (A.K.A. Au): John Lennon and Yoko OnoThe rest of the album is worthless and the rest of his albums."
4,Economy Rotor,"The Power Stop AR8161 is a fair economy rotor for the 2003 Ford Focus. Did not feature and fully machined hub area as pictured, and as expected no protective coating/painting of non-friction surfaces (This was the case with the model I received 5-months ago). A better ""looking"" choice other than the Power Stop AR8161 is the IAP/Dura International BR54079 which works just as well, and features a fully machined hub area with a cross-hatched ground braking surface and again no protective coating. Ordered the one IAP/Dura and one Power Stop rotor due to there only being one Power Stop in stock at time of order ... prefer the IAP/Dura. I don't normally mix parts like this, though it turned out okay for me."
4,Good product with reasonable price,"This is my first portable cd player. I use it with a Sennheiser MX500 Earbud.The soundstage is open, wide, dynamic.I like it."
4,Quality lacking compared to other Wow toys.,"I was really excited to see this camper at such a great price. We have the WOW garbage truck and love it. WOW seems to make toys that are lots of fun without batteries! A rarity these days.The camper, however, doesn't seem as well made as the garbage truck. My 3 year old likes to play with it, but the back door keeps falling off, which is a source of frustration for him. And then I have to step in and reattach the darn thing, which is a source of frustration for me. The camper also has some sticker designs on it - of course my son began peeling them off immediately. So now it looks beat up and used and we've only had it for a few weeks.I will definitely buy more WOW toys in the future - but I will choose more carefully. I think this might be an older model (newer toys aren't produced with sticker designs)."
1,NOT FOR RUNNING SHOES,"These laces are elastic. I read the other review where someone used them to replace their Salomon laces, which is what I needed done. I don't run in Salomon's anymore but did like the lacing system, so I have purchased Salomon replacement laces in the past and used them on other running shoes, so I thought I'd give this cheaper set a shot.My shoe size is 9.5 and these laces barely were able to fit the shoe. They are elastic so I am still able to slip the shoe on but I have no need to tighten the laces. In fact they are a little too snug. First run I did in them I had to stop to adjust the laces because they were cutting off circulation.If you are looking to use something for running spend the money and buy a Salomon pair."
5,Just What I Needed~,"I needed a Euro Pillow to fit the sham that came with my ""bed in a bag"" comforter set. Found one easily at Amazon.com. It came fast and in good shape! I was pleased!"
2,disappointing,Not worth the money. Super cheap covering and the filling was just a rolled up ball of poly fill that needed lots of pulling and shaping to fill out the form. You'd be better off buying your own poly fill and sewing your own little square.
1,disappointed,You get what you pay for. Not at all what I expected. Foam filling. no feather/down included in pillow. Do not recommend buying
4,Great sturdy hammer with a flawed handle,"First off this is all around a great hammer, almost gave it a 5 star review. I've been doing a lot of demolition with this sucker as well as used it to ""persuade"" objects into place and of course the usual hammer business of driving nails: it does all of this extremely well and the weight is very comfortable for me.However, the handle is slippery as hell if you're wearing gloves. I have the Mechanix gloves with leather palms and once I have accidentally thrown this hammer across the room after some tiring demo work. Without gloves it is no problem to grip the handle, and it very well may be that once I break it in some more the handle gets more grippy - but for now just be warned that this is one slippery handle."
3,urrgggg,"Of course, Amazon shipping was perfect.As other reviewers have stated, you buy this hammer because of the leather handle. I have my 16 oz. from when I started building in 1975.It seems that Estwing has listened to the complaints about the stickers ruining the handle - mine came with no stickers on the handle! Yay!Except that one of the rings of leather on the handle was flawed, but they just went ahead and lacquered it and shipped it anyway. The gap in the leather was obvious, but passed Estwing's quality control nonetheless.Should I send it back? I'm not going to. I guess this is my time to give up hope for others' pursuit of quality... Made in USA... yay...whatever..."
3,Epoxy in the wrong places,"While the leather washer handle is an interesting concept, there were a few problems with the one I received. The epoxy coating to protect the leather was missing on the lower part of the handle, and there was epoxy on the face and claws of the hammer. The hammer states that it is made in the USA."
4,A good history of a team without much.,"The Seattle Mariners for a long time were the laughing stock of major league baseball like most expansion teams such as the Mets, Expos, and currently the Devilrays. This book tells of their turn around and how they went from joke to contender. This is the organization that scouted and developed Randy Johnson, Ken Griffey Jr, and Alex Rodriguez. Although they are short on history, one game will forever live in my memory. This is when the Mariners had to play the New York Yankees in a playoff game, winner take all. The mighty Goliath Yankees against the David of a team Mariners. And who would be the hero of that game, the smallest of them all, Joey Cora. This is a good book to show how an expansion team has to build itself to catch up with the teams that have been in the league for a century."
4,Great Sports Writing,"You'd think a book on a team that DIDN'T make it to the World Series would be a bust, but Thiel did such a great job of telling the story that it's well worth the investment."
4,Fun behind the scenes look,"This was a fun read to relive the magic of the M's from the early days though the 1995 season, up to the 2003 season. A lot of quotes from the main players with some nice behind the scenes peaks at major league baseball.A must-have for any Mariner fan."
4,A VERY GOOD READ,"THIS BOOK COVERS THE HISTORY OF THE SEATLE MARINERS IN VERY GOOD DETAIL. IT IS QUITE INTERESTING AND VERY WELL WRITTEN. I FOUND SOME OF THE HIGHLIGHTS TO BE THE STORIES CONCERNING PINELLA, A-ROD, GRIFFEY AND THE BIG UNIT. IT COVERS FROM THE EARLY MAJOR LEAGUE TEAM IN SEATTLE AT THE TIME, THE PILOTS UP TO 2003. ALSO I ENJOYED THE STORY OF THE OWNERSHIP ESPECIALLY WHEN THE JAPANESE BOUGHT THE TEAM. TO PUT THIS IN A NUTSHELL, I RECOMMEND THIS FOR ALL MARINER AND ALL BASEBALL FANS."
5,Used,The book helped me in my Scientific writing course even though I fell apart after I finished but it's cool.
1,Unreal and Complicated,I do not believe I will ever make any of the dishes in this book. Full of offbeat and hard to obtain ingredients. Perhaps suitable for a professional chef who has access to such items as fresh squid-ink pasta or pickle masala. Real food? Simple? Nope.
4,"Great Yarn, Very Soft","I bought this yarn after learning how to knit less than 2 days prior. It is strong, doesn't untwist too easily and as incredibly easy to knit with. I am making a scarf with this. I ended up needing to purchase a second spool. I'm using size 11 needles and have 16 stitches across.The fabric does shed a bit when working so you will have to vacuum up afterwords."
3,Night City Stories,"This is an adventure/campaign book for Cyberpunk 2020, the roleplaying game of the Dark future. Having played the campaign, its pretty good - the missions are based around your usual extraction and corporate saboutage, but each one has an interesting twist. The difficulty and tech levels are moderate - suitable for a beginning party - and there is enough guidance to help you get your teeth into it. On the other hand, advanced teams might find things rather linear, and the plot does hinge on certain characters staying alive."
2,Worth a try for the true DEVO fan.,"CD liner states that this was recorded on a 4 Track tape deck. It sounds like it also!!! First five tracks are pretty good, I like ""Praying Hands"" the best. I don't quite understand the last five or six tracks on this CD. There appears to be somesort of a show that the band is putting on but we as listeners can't figure it out! Again, for the true DEVO fan that can afford to throw away the $$$."
3,Good screen but the stink is not going away!!,I've been using the screen for a couple of months now and happy with the quality. But the smell just won't go away!!!I've left it open for weeks but it doesn't seem to help.Any suggestions?
2,bojangles is an imposter,"This album cannot possibly be as godawful as the samples...supplied. Jerry Jeff never sang as badly as the Bojangles cut even when he was falling down drunk.I'm going to keep browsing. Somewhere there must be a re-release of the old ""Bojangles"" LP, the one with Bromberg's picture on the back."
4,Darn fine hat.,"Let me start out by saying that I hate hats. Last week I shaved my head so I needed something to keep the sun off. I bought myself a fitted Miami Heat cap and this for my dad. The heat hat was made out of some material that doesn't breath so it made my head itch and peel. I borrowed the hat a gave my dad not 3 days earlier. I love it. It is cotton so it breathes well, the plastic adjuster strip is of fairly good quality, but only has one row of studs. The brim is also fine; it takes alot to crease it. Do yourselves a favor, buy the Death Stick Skull and Crossbones Hat."
1,misrepresentation,"Back of hat does not read ""make the nail bleed"" as stated in the advertiment, but rather Dead on Tools. I was very disappointed."
3,"Nice Hat, but Poor Choice of Maker","I like the hat, it looks good, and has a quality adjustment strap [not one of those cheap plastic straps we all hate], but.......Made in China?Look if ""Dead On"" want's to supply the American Worker with quality tools, I think it's wise to sell us ""Amarican Made"" hats and other products too."
1,Sell out,"Ok i bought the hammer, thought it was cool being pro-america and labelled ""American to the bone.""Then I got the hat and it's MADE IN CHINA. Thats a load of crap and Dead On Tools is a bunch of sellouts. If you want to support overseas market share increase and put Americans out of a job buy this product!"
1,Brainless Crapola!,What! $17 for a baseball cap - you are nuts. How poser chic. Skulls and death are so.....yesterday.
3,I think the book is an excellant introductory reference,"Through reading this book, I gathered valueble information in the earth science fields of meteorology, climatology and oceanography. I consider this book to be a useful reference tool in introductory courses of the aforementioned fields. I think the author did an exceptional job of describing terms ""in layman"". I will purchase the book in the future for my meteorological library."
3,Oscar Wilde book,I was surprised to see this was an old library book. Sadly two of the pages were torn and there was permanent marker on the inside cover and title page. Thankfully the recipient did not mind these.
2,A disappointment,"After her brilliant ""Where Oh Where"" disc, the best disc of Broadway songs since 1959's B. Cook Rodgers & Hart Album, Judy sings to overblown arrangements of great songs. The nightclubby orchestrations minimize the power of each song. None of her great trills, deep emotions and ubridled joy displayed on the ""Where Oh Where' album are in evidence here. Honoring various Broadway Divas was a great idea. Sad to say it is not up to her best standards."
5,why arn't these tapes being made any longer?,"I've been searching for this tape for awhile now and had a hard time searching for it..thank gosh I found this website. But, my only concern would be that they're not making these tapes anymore as noted on this website. I was primarily looking for the ""Errand boy"". I would like to purchase the collectable tapes. Either way am still going to do the purchase.Thanks."
3,The Curse of the Maniacal,"This book is not going to be for everyone. Although I can get into Nabokov's ecstasies as much as the next guy, this book is hard to get into.The reason for that is admirable, I think, in that it seems to be exploring the mind of someone incredibly unstable and, because of that, the book itself is unstable and hard to follow. It's interesting, the way that Luzhin's wanderings and feeble fight against his own dementia drives him to improbably awkward moments of absurdity. However, this also makes the book irreconcilably sprawling and directionless.Some people will enjoy this treatment, ultimately the only realistic one this subject would warrant--but aside from its insanity, the ending of the book was also less than satisfying in many ways, and to me that's a dealbreaker."
5,People As Specimens,"Vladimir Nabokov's ""The Defense"" -- is about a chess genius who is something of an idiot savant. Nabokovexamined people much as he did butterflies (he was a great amateur lepidopterist, you know?): that is, he wastaken by the miracle of them, in all their myriad variations. He was both objective and empathetic as he pinnedhis characters to the page, at once a scientist and a poet -- and he told a good story, besides. This is a short book,only a bit more than 200 pages and, for me, one of his best."
5,Works great.,"I also bought this for my salt lamp and it works great. Am hoping it lasts a long time. This item is hard to find in my area, so I will definitely reorder this on Amazon."
4,Needed it for brother sawing machine.,Did the job. My only problem was that the bulb is not shaped evenly. it was lopsided so little hard to fit in the already small space on the machine. but it did and works great.....STILL.
3,Beautiful but,"I love the look and quality. However it is not a travel nice as I would like. I carry it down many plane isle as it's to wide to roll smoothly and it does not fit under all seats. Isle sets almost never. I have only used it on Delta flights but have been on 24 planes, carried it on at least 12 of them and it did not fit under the seat on 4 or 5 of them."
1,If you had less than one star I would use it,"My staff bought this item for what they thought would be a very nice gift. It was bulky, stiff, small on the inside, did I mention stiff, the zippers are uncooperative and stiff. The mismatched seams and thread make it look cheap - which it isn't.and if you try to return it, you are slapped with a $29.41 restocking fee (not mentioned in the advertisement) plus shipping.If there was a rating below 1 star, I would use it. I would give this thing a -7"
2,its leather alright,very stiff leather!! hard time getting laptop in and out. so much so that i am not using it. sorry
5,Excellent case!,"This case is roomy enough for my 15"" laptop and accessories, yet it can fit under an airplane seat when you remove the wheel frame. The telescoping handle opens and closes easily. The case even comes with a raincoat (protective cover)! Very good quality and quite stylish."
2,Not necessarily good value,"This price is too good to be true. The greensand that is delivered is wet, not dry, and so the 40# amount is not just greensand but also whatever liquid has been added. The amount of greensand that I got is probably more like 15-20# of dry greensand. Very disappointing, but I should have known better! I won't be buying from this company again."
5,Rank & File CD from Amazon.com sounds great!,"I never thought I'd find a CD of this band's work but there it was, on Amazon. While I would have gladly settled for a used CD in good shape, I found a seller with new CDs to offer. Service/shipping were terrific and the CD sounds great!"
5,Oeming giveth and Bendis taketh away.,This mini is where Marvel traded in a cheesy villian version of the greek god for a true God of War.
4,Nostalgia in black and white,"Don't think of Lili Marlene only as a popular song among german soldiers during World War II. It's mainly the story of a girl standing under a street lamp in front of barracks, while the fog is darkening the streets of a little town ; and who will stand with her when the night falls and the shadows are swirling around? Although there are a few modern songs on the CD, most of the songs recorded here are nostalgic of bygone days, of men who wan't come back, of flowers on the graves. The voice of Marlene Dietrich is a bit hard and hoarse, a voice in black and white. It reminds you of all these fascinating movies in black and white of the thirties (think of Lang, Murnau,...). Technically speaking, the rythm, here and there, is too fast, and the recording is not very good, but it's not so important. Just listen and and take a dive in the crooked and foggy (and disturbing) streets of pre-war Europe and the smoky cabarets of Berlin."
5,"soulful sincere vocals, smooth transparent procuction","This is one of the most beautiful albums to come along in a long time.In a world where just about anything can be and often is machine or software manufactured along comes an album that just knocks all those ideas aside. These songs are the words you've always wanted to hear from a loved one to yourself, from a parent to a child, a friend to a friend. Words of encouragement, love, devotion and faith.They are simply and honestly told and reach the heart in ways this listener appreciates more and more with each listen.The production is kept sparse and very sincere with authentic sounds that compliment the singer from every angle. It caresses, supports, lifts and suspends the vocals at every turn in ways that are now and again transparent and yet still mellifluous.If you want to tell someone you care about them buy this CD and send it to them. They will feel treasured.I do.Sincerely,Catte Adams--singer/songwriter/producer"
5,Long Time Coming,I have waited a long time to find an artist who truly speaks to the heart. These songs are FANTASTIC!! Do you have any other items from this artist? A true gift to those of us who enjoy music. Rare to find an artist whose music is as good as their voice!!!! 5 Stars
5,Pure Joy in a disk....A great voice.....incredible,"This is a must for any collector of fine male voices. Ron Sorensen's voice is pure. Listening to his stories in song takes you away, it's the music you hear when your in your special place. A definate chill up the spine when he hits that certain note."
3,disapointing,"For the past couple of years I've been seeing Bob Hicok's work in various journals and anthologies. I always found the poems interesting and pretty good, if not stellar. And I've seen some good reviews for Animal Soul, so I was rather excited when I finally picked up this book. And I found it a bit disapointing. I'll admit, these weren't the most awful poems I've read, but Hicok's rambling all over the place in a single poem weakened the good work. And I found that his line breaks generally seemed arbitrary and disrupting to the flow of the poem. But the poems I've read of Hicok's that I like should be in his next book, so I'll keep my eye open for it."
5,great book,"This is an amazing book by one of the best young poets working today. I've followed his work for some time and it gets better with each book. I never know what he's going to say or how he'll say it. The poems have a great deal of energy, they pop without sacrificing content. I can't wait to see where he goes next."
5,Animal Soul,"It's no surprise this book was a finalist for the National Book Critics Circle Award. Hicok is blessed with both imagination and purpose. His poems often surprise, in language and content, but always toward some end. More than anything, what comes across is his interest in people, a curiosity about who we are and how we behave. This is one of the best collections I've read in years."
2,"Warning - cog wheel cracks, phone falls off","The Sydney Harbour case is great until the cog wheel that connects the case to the clip cracks apart. Even if just a little piece comes off, the phone will easily fall off the clip. This happened once and I exchanged the case - the vendor was very accommodating - but it has now happened again. The clip needs to be made with a metal insert and not brittle dimpled plastic."
4,Good performance,"Works great, has kept screens/surfaces looking great with obvious exception of areas NOT covered. Have had minor issues with my phone flipping open ""on its own"" but no harm done from that yet that I'm aware of.Very sturdy thus far!"
1,NO PICTURES in an art book?,"How can an artist purchase a book with NO PICTURES TO see what I'm buying!! What the heckis that about? Didn't purchase for a few reasons, 1 . one reviewer also disappointed no pics. 2. Want to SEEwhat I'm buying ... also 3. I'm an artist, don't need to be any more depressed by the author's psychological viewpoint! Sounded too depressing!Seldom look any further at a book if I can't search inside and see color photos ... lots!"
1,The reviews stopped me from buying the book...,"I don't even know what the book looks like.I was interested in the paintings.Now that i have read the reviews, I have no compulsionto support another angst-ridden author lookingfor a way of putting his ideas of lifeon a defenseless painter of the 19th century.Transparent, mirror-image writing by an insecurewriter helps none of us that are not like-minded.So...the reviews were helpful."
5,An excellent beginning,"This book made me hungry for more texts on the topic. It examines fascinating questions and is excellent for the inquisitive physics or beginning philosophy student. As a physics major, I found parts of the chapter on dispositions heavy going, far deeper than I would prefer. The chapters on electromagnetism were pure delight, however. Towards the end of the book, the author and I parted ways over the issue of relativity; it takes rather a lot of nerve to tell the entire physics community, ""you're doing it wrong,"" about a subject upon which they are constantly fending off attacks already.I have read the book through twice, taken extensive notes, and will likely read much of it again. I have yet to find another text on the topic that touched so many of the interesting questions of ontology in physics, and I have been looking."
4,"Retire the 33s, a good collection","Being a die hard Havens fan, I'm glad this collection is out there. Slide this puppy into the cd player in the old VW van, fill the tank and buzz down the road like old times. In fact, maybe better cause cassette tapes were lousy then. Flash a peace sign as you travel."
2,This doesn't need a book,"This is just a flipbook of websites, along with the names of the studios that designed them. There's no additional commentary or analysis. You could Google ""web design studios"" to find many of the same sites (and better ones), in all their glorious detail and interactivity."
4,Slightly better than the Proxxon,"I have both this one and the Proxxon drill press, the table is slightly better on the Micor-mark and it comes with the chuck.The movement on the micromark seems slightly tighter, but that may be from lot differences.Handy little unit."
2,"Get the 24"" or 36""","Stream Machines are loads of fun on a hot day. In a pool, lake, or river where reloading is easy.But get the24 inch modelor36 inch model. Way better than the 12"", which has so little capacity and range.Stream Machine quality has gone down hill since 2002. They are lighter and more breakable but still, there is nothing better for serious hot-weather water fights."
3,Get the Single Barrel,"Stream Machines are loads of fun on a hot day. In a pool, lake, or river where reloading is easy.Double barrel looks impressive, but you'll have about half the range. Single barrels will pulverate you. Go 36-inch. Or 24-inch for younger kids."
4,"Great hammer, but not stainless","This is a great hammer with great features. But stainless it is not. One of the main reasons I got it was the stainless head, but mine started to rust within days."
1,Not even worth 1 star,"Ok, so it wasn't the movie that was bad but the dvd quality. I've seen the movie before so I decided to buy it on dvd....bad mistake. The dvd was so bad I wasn't even able to make out their faces. It was probably pirated. If you buy this dvd buy directly from amazon..yes the dvd is more expensive but its worth it."
4,minnesota iron ranger,this router bit like all other dremel bits i have purchased in the past is of high quality and will continue purchasing.
4,Better than average-worth the price!,"JVC XL-PG37 Personal CD Player with 45 Seconds of Anti-Shock Protection (Diamond Black)My soldier son wanted a good cd player to carry with him when traveling and otherwise permitted. He was looking for good sound and reliability, and says he got both in this player. When I asked him whether it was worth the 3-4 times higher than the average cd player price, his answer was an unqualified ""YES."" The only reasons this doesn't get a 5 star rating is that the player doesn't appear to be the sturdiest thing (despite its anti-shock characteristics), and that it comes with no protective case or rechargeable batteries. It is hard to find a better than average cd player that will play all types of cds these days, but this one fills the bill!"
4,my scenes rock bratz stink!!!,who ever said my scene are ugly is wrong they do not know what there talking about i like myscene bratz have big ugly heads and they act like big fat idiots!!!!!
1,LETS JUST SEE ABOUT THAT!,"MY SCENE ARE PUT WITH THE BARBIES AT THE STORE. BARBIE IS NUMBER ONE! SHE HAS BEEN AND ALWAYS WILL BE! AND AT THE STORE THERES WAY MORE PEOPLE BUYING MATTEL PRODUCTS! 14 GIRLKS MIGHT OF LOOKED AT THEM, BUT 14 GIRLS MIGHT NOT OF BOUGHT THEM!"
1,Bad spelling!,"These Bratz products are making little girls think that everything that ends in 's', ends in 'z'. Could we get some correct grammer here? Altleast My Scene is properly spelled!"
3,It's Ok,"This is not a bad movie, but it's not exactly a good movie either. My 8 year old daughter enjoyed it. Also, please don't review a movie if you haven't seen the movie. It's not fair to people who are looking for ratings based on people who have actually seen the movie."
1,I agree with you Sara Siblini!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I have readed all your reviews about the my scene dolls.""MY SCENE GOES HOLLYWOOD CHELSEA""3 TIMES.Yes thats right.I must get Barbie and the Magic of Pegasus and My scene goes Hollywood insted.Bratz dolls realy suck.Yes thats right.They are realy ugly.I am 8 years old and I love my scene and Barbie."
1,EWW!!!BRATZ?????,This movie looks terrible and Bratz are bad because they have percing in thier stomach and a tatoo in this band.This thing is bad for little girls.Get my scene or Barbie is much better.
1,Wrong Again...,"We have lives beause a review only takes so long to write. The My Scene boys were in a band, and competing to get a demo recorded. The Bratz started the copying from the Diva Starz. It's not like the My Scene copies everything from Bratz. Mattel made them to give MGA a taste of their own medicine, NOT the other way around. Nobody said that this movie sucked, and would we be saying that if we haven't seen it? NO! CGI animatin is cool, but Barbie had it first. The animation was terrible, so I guessed thats why they changed it. And if Bratz were 1,000,000,000 times better than My Scene, that would make them supernatural... not in this lifetime!!! The movie copied EVERYTHING from Mattel movies, so don't buy it. And I don't think it sounds cool!"
5,My Scene dolls suck,"They are ugly and slutty and dumb. You My Scene fans are pathetic. If you hate Bratz dolls, then why do you come here, huh? That is because you do not have a life. Besides, Bratz dolls are better then my Scene dolls. My Scene dolls have copied Bratz dolls all the time, and MGA was getting tired of that, so they copy them to see how they like it, and maybe if they don't like it, then they will stop. My Scene dolls are ugly and slutty and skimpy and discusting. Bratz rule and My Scene drule."
1,"""I DON'T THINK THIS MOVIE IS COOL"" IS 100% RIGHT!","Mattel's movies are way better than bratz movies. All MGA has that is a ""hotseller"" is Bratz. Mattel has Barbie, My Scene, Polly Pocket, and many other toys that are selling. This movie and the dolls are trash. The cgi animation was copied from the Barbie movies, the band/demo record was copied from the first My Scene movie, the look was copied from the Diva Starz, the doll movie thing was copied from mattel, and the song albums from the movie was copied from Mattel as well. The My Scene dolls wear beautiful colors , normal hairstyles, have a great movie, and a well-behaved celeb that a lot of girls look up to(the stories are ALL rumors). So get that movie, and the awesome Barbie movie. Please, though it may be tempting, don't support the wanna-be copying copany, MGA."
1,There are a number of words that can explain this dvd:,"1.vile2.disgusting3. freaky4. dumb5. superficial5. childish6. annoying7. putrid8. disgusting9. retarted.DUMB BRATZ FANS ARE SO ANNOYING, U ARE FREAKY, OBSESSED PPL, U OUGHT TO BE ASHAMBED OF BEING SO OBSESSED WITH A DUMB BUNCH OF TOYS...TOYS????? HOW STUPID ARE U GUYS IN LOVE WITH DOLLS"
4,SHUT UP!,You stupid little children who are dissing Bratz are the stupidest idiots EVER! Bratz and my scene are the exact same because the unoriginal my scene people copy every idea that MGAE has! You Bratz dissers are the lamest sluts ever! And I hope my scene gets pulled off the shelves until they can come up with their own ideas!
5,I want this movie,"I want this movie so bad, it looks awsome.And you My Scene fans need to go away, My Scene dolls suck and Bratz rule.this movie looks 100%times better then the My Scene movie. Linsey Lohan sucks just like My Scene dolls.Bratz are better then My Scene dolls, and this movie looks awsome.Get this movie, it sounds awsome."
1,I think we have an answer,"Having trawled through 200+ reviews on this film, I've come to the conclusion that Bratz obviously retards the intelligence of those that collect them. At least 40% of the reviews on here are repeats, 5% seem to be about the movie and the rest is Bratz and My Scene fans calling each other names, with the Bratz fans making the dumbest statements.Face it, you whinge about Barbie being a bad example for the young, but honestly the Bratz tagline is 'girls with a passion for fashion and boys' So the only important things in life are clothes and dating, hey if that ain't sexism what is? At least barbie (not my scene) got to be a doctor."
1,Are you trying to avoid Barbie?,"Sure, My Scene may of copied a little off of Bratz but what about Bratz copying Barbie?! And Diva Starz?! Face it. Bratz have been copying these for a long time! Without Mattel, MGA would be nothing!"
1,My Scene Rox!!!,"Get the My Sene Movie! That movie will be 1,000 times better than the Bratz strippers! My Scene will always be 1,000% better than stupid, ugly, slutty, gay, retarted Bratz!"
3,Bratz vs My scene,Bratz are pretty and they are really cool but I like My scene because they are GORGEOUS from HEAD to TOE literally! Sorry I can't say that about Bratz because they have no TOES!!!
1,UNCOOL!,"This movie looks absolutly unfabulous! I listened to the songs and went to the cd/dvd site, and it ALL looks unamazing! I'm not a fan of Roxxi, and I don't know much about her, but that's not about to change!!! Trust me! This is a lot dumber that that cool-looking My Scene movie!!! That My Scene movie looks fabulous! Buy that movie, not this movie!!!"
1,Another rock star story!,"Oh great. I read it cuz I love dolls but not only are the dolls ugly, their movie is too. I know a lot about this and it's really boring. They're pretty much wearing the same outfit. Don't get it."
1,DON'T BUY IT!!!,"Everyone here is right! MGA copied Mattel. If you accuse My Scene of copying Bratz, that's okay, because Bratz definately copied Diva Starz (no doubt about it!). So you end up saying Mattel copied Mattel. Anyway, I agree with everyone who says don't buy this movie, get the much better MATTEL movies, because Mattel had the great ideas first. MGA justs copies them. So, don't buy this movies. If you do, you'll be helping the bad guys, and hurting the good guys. So please, try to understand."
1,I AGREE WITH EVERYONE ELSE,"This movie is so a copy of everything from mattel. If your going to accuse mattel of copying MGA (making a My Scene movie when MGA was making a My Scene movie), well ,HELLO! Mattel made doll movies first. Don't buy this Bratz movie. Get the more wholesome, cooler, popular, and better Mattel movies coming out. Get Barbie in the Magic of Pegasus and My Scene Goes Hollywood. If you buy this movie, you will be supporting a fake and a bad role model. I don't think that that is what you want. Is it?"
1,It's a copy!,It's so plain and clear that this movie copied off of many mattel products. I mean come on!!! MATTEL made dolls. MGA made dolls. Mattel made mopvies. MGA made movies. Mattel made song tracks. MGA made soundtracts. Will they ever stop copying off of Mattel?
5,Can't Wait!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"This movie looks so cool! And then we get to play it on video game! Its way more alive than myscene. Myscene isen't original, they have to put a celeb in their movie to make some money. They don't have their own ideas. Bratz Rock Angelz looks more fun. Whereas myscene looks like alot of drama about some boys, like always. So what do they do thru the whole movie? Ask where Madison is? I like Disney movies but not myscene disney movies. Bratz Rock Angelz looks better and is more cool! Neither doll is ugly, but Mattel copied the Bratz, so basically Mattel really likes how the Bratz look otherwise they wouldn't have made the myscene look like Bratz. Bratz Rock Angelz rock the doll world! Theres a 170 reviews!"
3,All right Michelle and Morgan!!!!!!!Fighting is over!,"This is stupid we are fighting about dolls.By the way,if I hated Bratz or you hated my scene,they are just dolls made of plastic.OK!!!!They are something you can play with and have fun,even if they are ugly.I think this movie looks ok.I must see it.OK!!!!Michelle and Morgan.You`re saying I am stupid and I never rock.I don`t wont to here people saying this word on me.This thing is bad.We must get alife and forget about something stupid.Like fighting about dolls.Just like babies.I must watch this movie.I am going to get it+my scene goes Hollywood and Barbie and the Magic of Pegasus.OK???????????UNDERSTAND???????????Fighting is over and deal with it.SARA!!!!!!!!!Come on.We are Fighting about dolls and we are 12 years old.We are just like babies.We must forget about this thing and getalife.PROMESS ME ABOUT IT.OK???????"
5,Bratz Rock Angelz Rock!,"I really want to see this movie--I can't wait until it comes out on September 13! Also, I can't wait for the T.V. series--which starts on 4KidsTV (channel 5, I think) on the morning of September 10! I hope that this review helped!"
3,let's get 1 thing straight:,"I'm a guy, and I have not seen this movie. I keep seeing the commercials on cartoon network (My favorite channel), and I was curious about it so I looked this up. But then someone in a review for the audio CD said there was 'sexual references' and nudity in this movie. Please, God, don't let America's youth be watching things like that...- Brian Morrison"
2,Listen Here Michelle!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Even Bratz or my scene are just dolls Understand?They are just fantasy and dolls you can have fun and play with.Even if I hate Bratz or you hate my scene.I don`t know how the movie looks like,but I must see it.SARA SIBLINI!!!!!!!!!!!!!!YOU ARE A STUPID GIRL MICHELLE!!!!!!!STOP ME AGAIN.I DON`T CARE ABOUT IT!!!!!!"
1,OH MY GOD!!!!!,First of all this is the worst animation I've seen in my life!!! There like what 14-16 and they look like they have fake lips! Their hair is the worst!!! Overall.... HATED IT!!!!
3,What's Ugly?,"What I want to know is what is so ugly about My Scene dolls? Those dolls have pretty hair,eyes,and nice shapes. As a matter of fact they look more like ""real girls."" And they have shapes similar to J-Lo. Bratz have big heads,skinny bodies,and FAKE GIANT FEET! Now what real girl would want to look like that? The only thing I like about Bratz are their faces and their clothes are really cool,but they do not look real like My Scene."
5,Great Book for Parents and Parents-to-Be,"I'm a new father and was given this book as a gift. I didn't really know what to think about it until I started reading and fell in love with it. It made me realize that I am now a part of this huge tribe of parents, that my wife and I are not alone. I reccommend it to all parents and it makes a great baby shower gift for parents-to-be. It's simply a lovingly-written, heart-warming book."
4,Sweet and sentimental,"Geared especially toward first-time parents, My Heart's First Steps will find a ready audience among those for whom it is intended. The construction itself, with short chapters, essays, and poems, will make it appealing to those first-timers in the dizzy world of parenting in which some days success is measured by having found time to brush your teeth, make the bed, and decide what you're having for dinner. Not actually prepared it and served it, mind you: just decided what to fix. The entries are short enough to be read in the 5-10 minutes at a stretch that are all new parents feel they can call their own.It's meant to be sweet and sentimental - and it is. I did find myself, at points, wishing for a little more of the gritty and grizzly side of new parenting issues, more of an Annie Lamott take on how very difficult it often is to devote yourself to a 10-pound morsel of demanding humanity."
1,False Advertizement,This appears to be a case of advertizing one item but delivering a lessor item. I ordered the pictured bullfloat and the recommended handle. What was delivered was different from the picture bullfloat and the handle could not be used with the bullfloat delivered. I contacted the company they re-delivered the identical item. I have returned the first bullfloat and await instructions to return the second bullfloat and the handle that I have no use for without the pictured bullfloat. I would appreciate contact with a customer service individual that can correct this problem. I can be contacted at (910)987-7590.
4,Incorrect advertisement,"Here is what it should say for advertisement:Extruded from magnesium alloyComes with clevis style bracketUse with No. 9 or No. 10 handles (sold separately)Made in the U.S.A.This was copied and pasted straight from the marshalltown website!This product does not come with the fancy rocker bracket that is pictured. Please visit the marshalltown site before buying.I rated this product as a 4 because its exactly what is described by the manufacturer. However, description on amazon equals -1 stars."
1,Disappointing quality,The quality of this part is substandard. The door lock toggle fits very loosely and wants to fall out. I would not buy these again or recommend them.
3,Not a Tensioner Pulley ( = no grooves in this item) ....,This product is not Tensioner Pulley for a 2007 Focus; no outer grooves.... don't buy this product. The correct product has grooves on outside of the pulley area.
2,Please rent,"I am a huge proponent of Two Can Play That Game and I am a big fan of Vivica Fox but THIS movie is not what's up. I'm sorry... I tried watching it and it took me like 3 days to finish it. I couldn't sit through it... it's difficult to be still long enough. It did not capture my interest and it wasn't really that funny. I gave this movie 2 stars only because my girl Vivica was in it. I suppose if I had not seen Two Can Play That Game, it would have been a little better but I was constantly comparing the two and... well there is no comparison. I wanted to be able to give this movie good reviews but I simply cannot. It's just not good. Jason George is quite handsome, though. :)"
2,Disapponting,This movie was not even close to being as good as the first movie. The only thing that prevented me from cutting it off was Tony Rock. The story line was horrible. It seemed as if the movie was rushed and there was a lot of over acting in this movie. Horrible!!!!!!!
4,no more games,I was slightly disappointed with the movie but it did entertain.You should always no when to stop and do not spoil a good thing. Its now time to stop.
2,Horrible sequel to a really good movie,"I had high hopes for this movie but after I bought it, I learned it went straight to DVD after being made and I knew that can't be good. THe only good thing about the movie was that the women were hot, that's it. Save your money and wait till the price goes down to like $2 or somthing before deciding to buy it, you are probably better of renting the movie but trust me, it's really not worth it, this was a huge dropoff from the first movie."
1,THREE CAN PLAY THAT GAME,I found the movie boring nothing like the first one at all. I would not recommend this movie to anyone.
2,just ok,"i dug two can play that game, but this one felt generic and predictable and didn't really have enough balance. it was lacking some overall depth and good humor. it was just ok overall on a whole."
2,dog trainer and puppeteer,"The Trainee is on the ropes; the boss lady wants herpiece of him, his best friend ( a fly/ player type) wants his perks too.But his best girl finds a counselor who has a five stepplan. The sparks begin to fly as the relationship progressesand the games go on.If a relationship is real, no games are necessary?Too many hands spoiled to soup pot.The end is predictable."
3,historical artifact,"Alice cooper is soon to be in the rock and roll hall of fame,he has created some of rocks greatest songs like 'I'm 18"" a song that everyone of that age should hear.he had tons of hit singles, but this was from that period when rock shows were interspaced with a 'movie'it is of it's time in that regard but the concert footage and the movie do feature the original band. One of the poor guys has passed away too so this is a chance to see the original 'alice cooper'. the newer live stuff is better though like 'live at montreax' etc. and the newest edition live at hamersmith. But this one is a worth owning for alice fans for the vintage footage , the movie parts can be seen once I would say and then it's better to just jam with the band."
2,bloodfans only,"This is a typical consert movie from the seventies where they try to destroy the consert with a surrealistic and completely idiotic additional movie. They all did it, Abba, Led Zeppelin,Neil Young, the Who and many more. but at least some of them have a good sound and they don`t interupt the consert all the time. When both sound and picture is way under average it dosen`t help that you can play the consert only under bonusmaterial. Pick the Montreux blue ray and skip this one."
2,math through paper folding,"This book was in really good condition, and the seller's description concerning that was quite accurate. However, I didn't have much info about the content of the book. It turned out to be boring text and too complicated for my elementary age students to create. I basically wasted my money. Not the seller's fault, though."
2,Ripped off,"I have taken Belly Dance classes, which have been much more engaging, fun, and well-done than this DVD. The woman in this video seems to know what she is doing and is pleasant, she's just fine, but the moves and boring, lengthy repetition were quite disappointing. I was so excited to use this video, but I decided to pay for another class at the YMCA and won't be using this DVD.The very worst thing, that I find quite deceptive, is that a great deal of the footage on this DVD and the one titled ""Perfect Hips Belly Dance Workout"" are exactly the same - they are the same footage. I feel ripped off with this."
5,great,I bought this to use whem I am making Greek yogurt. It works fabulous and has really been a time saver. I would highly recommend this to use for this purpose. Also it has no metal on the rim so it will not be a problem with rusting.
5,A spendy but totally worth it purchase.,"I Love home made greek yogurt. Rather than the hassle of cheese cloth, I bit the bullet and bought this strainer. The only thing you have to work around is that when a product needs to filter for a long while and be refrigerated, you need some kind of container. This strainer is very long. I found that it works over a plastic waste paper can. It does a really efficient job and I don't have to work with cheese cloth. I'm glad that I bought this."
5,Yonex Portable Badminton Court,"I like it. It is portable and easy to set up and put away. The only thing is, the width is not that wide for a doubles play. Aside from that I am very happy with my purchase. Thanks :)"
5,Excellent Outdoor Badminton Net,The Yonex Portable Badminton Court (Net & Stand) is extremely easy to put together and take down. You honestly don't even need to read the instuctions. It takes about 5 minutes to put up and a little less to take down. It is is very well constructed and sturdy enough to use even under slightly windy outdoor condition. The net is tight and does not sag. It comes with a carrying bag to cleanly store everything when taken down. I am very pleased with the purchase. My wife and I played for an hour the first day we put up the net and only had to stop when the rain came.
1,"Great Net, Too Small","This net design is GREAT, but it is just way too small in length.I DID NOT see the dimensions in the product description? Make sure to check."
5,Wonderful for the beach!,We brought the Eureka Solar Shade to Newport Beach and it was absolutely wonderful! It was relatively easy to set up and we had no trouble with it whatsoever throughout the day. This shade allowed our family to enjoy the beach for the entire day since those who don't like being in the sun could duck inside at any time. We love this!!! Great purchase!
5,Easy to use. MUST HAVE for children.,"We got this for our Hawaii vacation. It is extremely easy to set up. It takes two people: one to hold the fabric and the other to guide in the poles (2 separate poles). We did a practice run in the living before our trip to make sure we knew how it was done. On the beach, it only took 5 mins to assemble and 5 mins to take down. It provides excellent shade protection for babies, children, and adults. The fabric floor also helps minimize sitting in sand. We got a medium and it was plenty of space for 3 adults and a baby. It packs down into a nice size case of its own. On the plane it can be checked into a large suitcase. We'll use this again and again for afternoons at the beach and the park all summer long."
5,Solar Shade AWSOME,"Once a year our family takes vacations together. We have three grand-children that we thought the Eureka Solar Shade would be perfect for. We were so surprised of the actual size of the Solar Shade and found it perfect for adults as well as the children. It is so easy to set up and break down. All I can say is, ""AWSOME""."
2,Too small,"We purchased the medium size for two adults. The plan was for shade so we could spend more time at the beach to read. However the back slope is so steep that even sitting in the smallest chairs we could buy our heads were against the fabric , our legs in the sun. There is a trick to setting it up - only push the rods into place never pull. By the third set up it was easy."
2,Definitely NOT for beach use.,"While this shade looks good overall and may work for your purposes, I do not recommend it for the beach. It does set up easy, but the slightest breeze will cause it to collapse in on itself. It does pop back out but is very irritating to be constantly bumped in the head when the wind blows. Even with the sandbags full it still would lift off the ground in a breeze. We had to bury the base in sand and put coolers inside along the edges to hold it down. I am talking about 3-6 mph breezes. Another poor design is the windows. One day a light shower came while on the beach and because the window closure panels are on the inside the rain came right in and soaked the inside. If you just want some shade in your yard or at a festival where there will be no breeze or rain showers this may work for you. It wasn't up to our use and we sent it back."
3,Takes too long to set up,"We purchased this shade tent when our first child was born 3 years ago. We go to the beach a lot and needed a way to keep the baby in the shade as well as a discreet place to nurse and change diapers. We liked it at first b/c it's big enough for 3-4 to sit in comfortably and it can zip closed to be used as a changing tent. However, we found that if we weren't planning to spend several hours at the beach it wasn't worth the time and effort to set up and it doesn't perform well in wind. There are also three separate bags and several loose pieces that were often getting misplaced. After the first year, we rarely used the tent and we were not disappointed when one of the poles finally broke b/c it gave us an excuse to buy a Sport Brella."
4,Eureka Medium Solar Shade Tent,I am very satisfied with this tent. I use it at ball games for the infant. Easy to set up and take down. I just wish that the windows zipped because in the wind it blows the window covers up. I would recommend this purchase.
5,Eureka medium solar shade tent,"Awesome purchase! I was debating getting the large, but medium is plenty big and keeps the sunburns away. In a pink it can also be used for camping."
3,tent,"Don't use this on a windy day at the beach if you want to face the water. The tent acts like a kite and wants to blow away if the wind is blowing into it. We had to turn it sideways, so that we were looking at down the beach instead of at the water. We were disappointed.If you are going somewhere other that the beach with low wind and need a shaded tent this would be good."
4,Recommended,"Works as expected. Despite other comments, I had no difficulty setting this up on the beach, although I did do a trial run at home beforehand. Would recommend for anyone looking for this type of product."
3,Not what I'd hoped,"I was looking for a small, easy-up screen room to give a retreat from rain and bugs while camping. I called Eureka to make sure it had a closeable screen door, and they assured me that it did. Alas, they were wrong. It's usable only as a sun shade, so I had to send it back. Like other Eureka products, though, it is pretty good quality for what it is. The on-line catalogs need to make its nature clearer so others won't make the same mistake."
5,Best Bra Ever Made,"I discovered this bra quite a few years ago, and have been wearing it ever since. It is the most comfortable bra that I have found, and believe me I have worn a lot of them in my 57 yrs.They work very well with styles where you do not want a bra strap showing, so I use the criss-cross option. Also so works for gals like me where one shoulder is lower than the other, the criss-cross keeps the straps from falling down.Love them and will continue to wear them as long as Playtex will make them.Thank you Amazon for making it easy to find and order them."
2,seams are too visible,"I agree with the last poster, the seams on the cup are way too visible thru t-shirts! Also I don't like the satin poly fabric, looks very cheap. I don't know why the listing title says ""cotton bra"" because the only part that's cotton is the lining. Misleading.The cups are a little too pointy for my taste. I like a rounded cup. Basically if you don't like the look of an overdone breast (unnatural), don't get this one."
4,uplifting underwire,I like the way this product is made except for the seams are too pronounced. I like the fit and the way it makes me feel secure wearing it.
4,Spencer PT2-S,"I found this hammer to be even better than what I had expected. I would buy more in the future, as long as they are available. The Spencer hammers seem to be in much demand. I was happy to find these for sale on Amazon.com."
4,Not Bad!,"this is a real cool book and shows lot's of wonderful pictures you just can't resist! plus, it so real I can't believe it but the pictures do look like the real thing!"
4,Grows with time,"I have been a carpenter for 17 years and have used every kind of hammer you can think of. At first I was not sure about the death stick handle. But after about a day or so I noticed much more control with the curved handle. The handle has a oblong feel to it. If you have small hands look for another hammer. The hammer has a great impact force! The Magnet on my hammer should be a little bit stronger, but it still holds the nail fine as long as you swing soft. The handle is only 17 1/2"", not 19"". It is a driving hammer not a pulling hammer. The claw is great but you can not beat a metal hammer for demo. If you just frame houses, for the price, this is the hammer."
4,Great Hammer,"I received my Death Stick a month ago and have been extremely pleased with it. After reading the other reviews I gave it a real work out the first couple weeks and it has stood up to every test. I've used it for everything already, framing, demolition and stripping concrete forms and it is one tough son of a gun, there are not any signs of wear in the steel as of yet. Very worthwhile purchase."
2,"Meh, there are MUCH better hammers out there","Well to be honest I pick this up merely on the fact it's called the ""deathstick"" (marketing at its best eh?)Well, 3 months in there is no longer a waffle pattern, the magnet fell out, and it didn't do a very good job of pulling nails.Go get aUS TAPE PT-2 21 Ounce Smooth Face, Axe Handle Striker Hammerand be happy."
2,Don't buy it,"I bought this hammer and used it for three months before it was stolen--thank god. At first I loved it. The swing was nice and it drove nails well, but the finish wore quickly as did the cross hatching on the face. After the three months, the face was almost as smooth as my decking hammer. The face of the hammer is also rounded more than most which is fine until the face goes smooth, then the face starts slipping off the nail unless the blow is dead on. I have more success driving nails with my Hart decking hammer and will use it until I break down and buy another Hart or Douglas framing hammer."
5,Search is over,I'm a carpentry contractor who has been searching for the perfect framing hammer for 33 years and where do I finaly find it? Of all places a bookstore! Hammers with curved handles make it easy to drive 8d nails with one whack; 2 whacks for a 16. Unfortunatly my last curved handle framing hammer had a weird head positioning which made it difficult to toe nail floor joists. No problem with the DS24-C. The magnetic nail holder is the best method for nailing out of reach and it should become standard on all hammers. Warning to novices: Hitting your fingers with this or any other waffle head hammer always produces almost intolerable pain and a bloody mess.
2,Not happy,I recently purchased a Death Stick from a local sales person and I find the Death Stick to be very disappointing.The magnet will not stay intact if the hammer is used to proform normal carpentry procedures.Also the material used to cast the head of the hammer is to soft and chips very easily.
2,Not so deadly,"I bought this hammer because of alot of hype. I don't really like the handle so much, it hurts my hand. The magnet is a good idea, but I have only used it a couple of times in the past 3 months. They need to find a better way to keep the magnet in there, I glued mine back in."
1,a good looking piece of junk,"While steel headed death sticks have a nice feel when you swing them, these hammers will rust without every day oiling, they wear out very quickly and I don't recomend them to anyone. I do however recomend the high quality line of titanium death stick hammers which last a long time and can't rust. If a titanium hammer is out of your price range and you want a decent checkered face ripping claw hammer, your best bet is probably a 22 ounce fatmax which is made by stanley."
1,The smell of rotting spuds,"This cd shows what can happen to a once great band that runs out of ideas,forgets how to write decent songs and is getting old. What is such a band to do? Why, just take some classic songs from your past glory days, slow them down, suck the life out of them, make them ""accesible"" to grandma and grandpa!!!"
3,Never meant for everyone,"From what I've learned this CD was a fan club release, thus, only for DEVO fanatics. But even so I can't imagine every die-hard DEVO fan being all too crazy about this either, as it basically tears down the very music for which we love DEVO. But also take in the fact that the band is (almost) always doing new, usually very interesting, ideas. I can't say this is their most fascinating, let alone best quality effort, but if you take it for what it is--an intentionally cheesy self-mockery--you just might really get into it.For me, however, I can't say I actually like most of the music, as many of the tracks seem hardly recognizable from their parents, but if you're looking from something fun, unique, and overall something DEVO-esque, this is it."
4,Devo makes elevator muzak!,"Before buying this disc you had best be aware that it is not anything close to the style of music you would expect from Devo. It is a clever muzak adaptation of the bands hits (and misses). I wish more artists put out records like this. If you are a hard-core Devo fan that's open-minded you will most definitely get a kick out of this. On the other hand, if the only thing you've heard from them is ""Whip it"", may I suggest doing your Devo homework first."
3,No indicator of what was to come,"This CD is interesting only becasue it is an early recording of Anita Baker. ""I Just Wanna Be Your Girl"" is okay, but nothing special. To hear Anita's voice over Disco thumpery is quite a jarring experience (imagine Aretha Franklin doing a gangster-rap duet with Eminem or Bob Marley giving square-dance instructions and you'll get the idea). Only for music historians and completists."
1,VERY POOR QUALITY,"I got this CD today not only was it scratched up, but it looked as if it had been to battle. This teaches me never to buy used. When I received it the CD was coming out of the case, and the little prongs inside the CD case that hold the CD in place were non-existing. I only listened to 1 song, because I was so disillusioned with the condition. I will not send it back, because I can't be bothered with the hassle. Lesson learned. If ever I see the seller pandering their wear, I no to avoid it....."
2,Preview of Coming Attractions,"Though the album has a very disco feel, Anita Baker shines brightly and is a great appetizer for her future work. ""I Just Wanna Be Your Girl"" is given that jazzy treatment that Baker always gives to every song. Though her vocals sound a bit constrained, they are hers and very lovely."
4,Well Worth The Money,"Great DVD/Receiver combo. It has a great flicker free picture and plays a variety of media. The receiver combo makes it easy to have a realitively high powered system with only this piece, a TV, and speaker system. No other bulky components to clutter your shelves. Being a 500 watt receive does make it get quite warm so suggest an open shelf, not inside a cabinet unless it has good ventilation. So far, no complaints. A great start for a Home Theater System."
2,Don't waste your money . . .,"Through trial and error, I have finally learned my lesson and come to the conclusion that the only decent prints of Bobby Breen films are to be found in the Roan Group releases of ""Fisherman's Wharf"" and ""Way Down South"". Though these are only two of the six or seven films Breen did at RKO, the quality of the Roan Group's releases far surpasses any other public domain offerings.ALPHA's double feature release of Bobby's films should be avoided. It is no improvement over the myriad of other versions already on the market.And, to whoever owns the rights to these wonderful pictures, whether it be Bobby Breen Productions or Warner Home Video, how about a break -- please release these titles for us fans to enjoy again."
4,none,"One of SF's most eclectically intelligent writer. Watson provides the reader with a plethora of ideas; the strange, weird, mundane, and eerie, then blends in his own brand of originality and supburb story mastery to give the reader a taste for more of his work, and it's nothing short of brilliant. Gary S. Potter Author/Poet"
5,Great Fun!!,"I had already seen this move and took a friend who was in a ""funk"" mood.Once the film started, she began to smile and didn't stop throughout the movie!! Her comment: That was great! It took me out of crabby into happy!!!"
2,Not impressed,We didn't get very far into the movie before we quit watching. What we saw was a bit crude and the story was rather slow. Maybe it would have gotten better but we were not inspired to persevere!
1,really boring!,"This was really hard to watch. Dumb and uninteresting throughout. My husband and I had to keep fast forwarding to see if something would happen other than at a snail's pace. So the guy met a girl. Big deal! there was no chemistry, no fun, no action, no laughs, no good acting, not even great scenery. Just a terrible waste of time. Tony Shaloub was great as Mr. Monk, but he is terrible here. How sad!"
2,Sloooooow to get nowhere,"I watched this movie based on the positive reviews. While I must say that I loved the characters, the movie was absolutely pointless."
3,"Slow, but okay","The acting in this movie was good. Tony Shaloub was his brilliant self. However, the plot was predictable and unexciting, except for the badger's appearance.And, there was a lot of license with the cold, which made the feel less than authentic."
1,Lame,This didn't do exactly what I expected. I assumed this would increase the aspect ratio of the camera- but in reality it simply added a magnifying glass to my lens. Which means I had to be zoomed in just to use the attachment.
1,If you want a clear film try...,"You should try the ""invisible shield"" (google it). It works great (no scrathes!) and is absolutrly clear. Alot of my friends have tryed skins and say they leave lots of scrathes when you take them off. For a case, I know one person who swears by Agent 18. Hope this was helpful!"
3,Not really a merry read for me,"I have to agree with one of the reviewers that this book dragged too long based on just couple of lies. I also thought the heroine was an unlikable character--She was stubborn and impetuous. Although she valued her freedom and independence highly, hated anyone (even her father and her long-time neighbor Ian) to ""manipulate"" her life, disregarding whether it was out of their love for her or not. Unfortunately, most of her willful decisions turned out to be with terrible consequences. This non-sensible female really did not deserve Ian's steadfast love in my eye, I felt it was a very lop-sided courtship. But I did like the hero and his romantic determination of wooing his intended."
2,If this had been in an anthology,"While this book had interesting characters, it didn't have enough plot to support this length book. Having a few lies keep the hero and heroine apart for the entire book tires well before the end."
5,A Book for All Women to be Inspired By,"I found the stories to be varied, interesting, uplifting and deep. Women everywhere can take heed and realize we are the ones who control our lives. It was a privilege to have my story, ""Just One American Beauty Rose,"" included in the collection. Kudos to editors Dianne and Anne."
2,Is it live or is it....?,"As an academic novel, Koestler's Call Girls has relatively little to recommend it, perhaps in part because it cuts so close the bone. Reading Koester's description of a small conference of academic ""call girls"" is all too similar to the real thing. The pompous posturing and politicking of such a group is every bit as tedious on the printed page as it is in person. If one is looking for an enjoyable academic satire, try David Lodge's Changing Places or Small World, try Richard Russo's Straight Man, or even try Jane Smiley's Moo; for a somewhat more serious expose, try Carl Djerassi's Cantor's Dilemma.Not that I wish to dismiss this work entirely; Koestler's novel is far more successful as a bleak commentary on the direction of the human race, mostly due to the two brilliant short pieces which frame the centeral academic tale. These pieces remaing brilliant and haunting despite the dry centerpiece."
2,I love Koestler. Don't start here.,"The Call-Girls is a novel evidently intended as a ""popularization"" -- since people like to read novels! -- of ideas that Koestler covered more exhaustively in his book-length essays, in particular The Ghost in the Machine and Janus: A Summing Up. The fictional structure is really little more than a skeletal frame into which Koestler has dumped (sometimes verbatim) arguments that he formulated elsewhere: A dozen ""quirky"" professor-types (one giggles, one blushes, one's outspoken and gay, one does ten things at once, etc.) -- the jetsetting symposia-attending call-girls of the title -- come together in Switzerland to discuss how mankind is to be saved from itself. So that's what they do. As story, this is less than gripping; and either of the abovementioned nonfiction titles will serve as a better introduction to Koestler's ideas, which ARE gripping."
4,Bel RX55,"Bel has made big improvements to their detectors over the years. They definitely manufacture the highest quality low-price units, and their overall product quality is right at the top w/ Escort & Valentine. This RX55 is very easy to use, and is not prone to the ""panic-type"" alerts of older models (which was a set-up to help drivers when encountering instant-on radar; but was very inaccurate). The mounting system is also hugely improved (Thanks, company partner Escort). For the money, it's a good buy. If you don't travel too much over the limit, or if this is a first detector - it's a good one. However, if you can swing it, the RX65 or Passport 8500 is a much better performer. That ""next step"" in detector pricing brings w/ it A LOT more sensitivity."
2,Not a great detector,I tried this RX-55 and found a lot of false alerts -- it seemed to just go off for no reason and I passed like 4 police cars and nothing. I researched online and asked radar experts and they agree -- the better one is the vector 955. Either upgrade to the rx65 or get the cheaper vector 955. I only write this to save many of you the hassle and unhappiness that I went through.
2,Not Reliable,"I have this enclosure and other brand. the other one works fine every time. The Adaptec doesn't recognize by the computer. I checked everything, and it is still not recognized."
3,"Decent performance, poor SACD (PCM-derived)","I was disappointed in the sound quality of the (stereo-only) SACD layer. Upon checking the liner notes, my fears were confirmed. The SACD layer was taken from a 96/24 PCM recording, and so sounds no better than that. Pure analog to DSD recordings (e.g. the RCS Living Stereo series) seem to produce a warmer sound with greater dynamics."
4,Superb performance,"This is clearly a great performance of the 9th symphony. Von Karajon leads a well prepared orchestra and conducts with a briskness that displays deep emotion without being hurried. I would give this 5 stars, however the sound is not as clear as with the RCA red Seal SACD's as performed by artists such as Reiner, Van Klibern, and Rubinstein. If RCA can develop a superior sound with older recordings, I can't understand why DG is technically inferior."
3,"2-Channel Stereo, Not 5.1 Surround","Just a quick note to warn buyers that this is a 2-channel stereo recording, not a 5.1 surround sound recording. I had presumed that all SACD recordings were surround sound, and I bought this disc based on that presumption, looking forward to being totally immersed in Beethoven's Ninth. I was very disappointed to discover that this SACD is not surround sound. I can find no indication anywhere on the product page that this is a 2 channel SACD, so I thought I'd post a warning for others expecting a 5.1 mix."
5,Brilliant!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,A superb performance and recording of the ninth symphony. It is right up there with the Toscanini gold label version. Excellence to the max.
5,The best Beethoven ever?,"Amazing perfomance, excelente sound, magistral maestro.The top 5 of all times Beethoven's 9 Symphony."
1,Carbide Grout Tool,I don't know what grade of carbide was used but it did not hold up. I bought a new one at Lowe's and it held up real well
5,Great & durable bit,"Great and durable bit for grout removal and other things where a 1/8th"" slot or hole is desirable - anywhere carbide will do the job this is it."
2,Didn't work for me.,I managed to get about 6 inches of grout removed and then the cutter was so dull it stopped cutting grout. Very dissapointing. I ended up using a $2 hand grout removal tool tot cut through the grout on the 5 tiles I was removing.
2,Not tough,"Could have been made tougher. It does the job, until it breaks. And it will break sooner or later."
2,Dremel 570 1/8-inch Carbide Grout Removal Bit,"i had about 7 mtrs of tiles to remove the the grout from.At first it was good but after doing half , the carbide coating wore of and i had to finish with a hand tool.Yours tulyGerald"
1,Easy Money,"Great fan of the man they call 'Sugar' Zucchero, but this outing is really below par. This CD consists of rerecordings of older songs, with the addition of other famous singers. Did he send the original recordings to these people, en did they ad little pieces here and there? It sounds like it! None of the songs have gotten' better compared to the originals.To me this cd is a total rip off intended to make easy money (and get more attention for 'Sugar' outside of Italy?). Don't buy it, get 'Oro', 'Shake' or 'Blue Sugar' instead!"
5,Great Show!,"I can't believe it. An import car motor sport DVD that's really about import car motor sports. I've seen other DVDs on drifting and import car racing, but they're more into ""T&A"" than the actual sport. Pure Drifting is like a real ""TV"" documentary that really tells all about the American drifting scene. The whole thing is great. The drifting shots, the interviews with drivers, everything is really well done.This isn't a wannabe Fast & Furious/Girls Gone Wild thing, so if that's what you're looking for, this probably isn't for you. BUT, if you're really interested in drifting and what it's all about, this is it. Pure Drifting is great."
2,"Eh, it's merely ""OK"".","I was pretty disappointed with this DVD. All it tells you is HOW to get into drifting. I just want to see some cool drifting clips, not be told every little thing that I have to do to be involved with it. If there were less interviews and more drifting clips, it'd be alright, but I bought this particular DVD because of all the good reviews that it had here on Amazon, but once I watched it, I knew I had been let down. After the fact, I have been told to stick with any ""Best Motoring"" DVD when it comes to drifting. Just thought I'd pass on the message."
5,Celtic Tiger show and soundtrack,This was the best show i have ever seen plus a fantastic soundtrack.THE BEST PART WAS I ACTUALLY GOT TO SEE MICHAEL FLATLEY LIVE WHICH HAS BEEN MY DREAM SINCE FOREVER!!!!!!!! I'm an irish dancer and would love to be in this show when i'm old enough!!!!
2,Michael Flatley's Celtic Tiger,Very disappointing - Nothing like Riverdance Would not recommend and I am avid fan
2,You know exactly what you are going to get...,"Michael Flatley's feet fly like a racehorse, but he is really a one trick pony. Now, if you like that one trick, you will like this (and every other) cd,and stageshow of his. If you are looking for something new, a progression of creativity, and expression, look elsewhere.When Riverdance first appeared, I was a fan of the inovative blending of Broadway, traditional Irish step dancing, and new age mysticism. And The talent of all involved is undeniable.But after other troops appear imitating the idea,and doing so almost as well. You must wonder why this artist deserves the loyalty of consumers buying the same , repackaged material over and over again.Darwin would say that those things that don't evolve and adapt will become extinct. Unfortunately, it appears to be a slow lumbering death,for the thundering feet of this dinosaur."
3,Not Claire's best,"I'm a Claire McNab fan and have been for a very long time. From the beginning of her Carol Ashton detective series, through to her most recent Denise Cleever ones. This book steps away from the genre, into romance/fun. Unfortunately, it doesn't make a graceful transformation. Some of it is fun for sure, but the entire premise is rather silly and geared towards teens. I would love to see Claire write a romantic story but the characters need to grow up and the story line would need to be a more mature one. It is not the worse read I've ever had, but it is not even close to the best. If this is the best Ms. McNab can do with romance, she should stick with her detectives, they are far more credible and interesting."
2,Writing My Love,Clare McNab is one of my favorite writers. This particular book was a disappointointment both in content and storyline. The plot and storyline was sophmoric at best. Stick with the detective.
4,writing,WritingThis book had me thinking of why the author did it this way? As I read the book I understood why in that she was hiding her identity because she was scared that she would be turned down by the person she has attraction to. I did like it wouldn't stop reading the authors books.
1,Can't handle a ground fault,"I purchased this product from a local merchant at double the price of Amazon because I couldn't wait a day or two. The specification sheet says ""This device does not include an internal Ground Fault Circuit Interrupt (GFCI)."" That statement lead me to believe that I could use the PI-400 to power my ground faulted device. I plugged in my known ground faulted device and the PI-400 went into immediate alarm with the red light and beeping. When the PI-400 was powered down and the ground faulted device removed, I then powered up the PI-400 and it continues to beep and stay in the alarm mode with nothing plugged into it. It's totally unusable. Cycling it off and back on any number of times only reestablishes the alarm state. I would expect it to recover, but it doesn't. It's going back to the vendor for a refund."
4,great if it didnt break,"i bought this nail puller for my boyfriend. he was using it on the job site, putting down plywood on a roof,when he went to pull the nail,which was a 16 common. the claw on the nail puller broke and almost caused him to fall. he said he would be pleased with the product if it was more durable. why would it break? isnt it suppose to be a nail puller?"
5,Husband won't use any other kind!,I have bought my husband two of these...the first one was lost. He loves it and won't use any other kind!
1,"Looks cool, functionally useless.","I bought this item today at the big orange box store to tear up a 300 sq ft deck. Within the first hour, one of the teeth on the straight edge chipped. By the end of the day, chunks were missing from all over. This item is made from poor quality steel. Furthermore, the circular saw wrench would constantly strike my thumb knuckle. Took it back to the store to get an Estwing. I took the opportunity to compare the stated manufacturing origin and material qualities when exchanging this item. The Estwing is drop forged and made in Japan. The Dead on makes no mention of forging, tempering, or hardening, and is made in China."
3,we'll see...,"I had ordered the shark puller but received this wicked looking thing instead. Too much of a hassle to return to Amazon, so I'll keep it. Right off the bat, this thing was taking indentations with just a couple whacks of my hammer. It is very capable of digging nails out, however, but the steel is obviously not very hard. The saw wrench is okay, but the large head of the nail pick makes it a little tricky to get on the nut. It will work on the fly, but a crescent or fitted wrench works way better. The bottle opener is also pretty poorly designed and takes a couple of tries before you can pry off the cap. It's a flashy tool, but I have my doubts as to how long it will hold up. Oh well, when it breaks, I'll just order the Shark again."
2,it was good...,it started out really good and i after using it for about 6 months it it pretty much useless b/c it wore so now it will not even grab a nail head anymore.
1,Can't pull it's own weight,Four members of the framing crew I work for got this nail puller because it finished off the DeathStick hammer and bags. Everyone of these nail pullers broke in the same spot just after a few weeks. The Shark Corp 21-2028 nail puller is the ultimate. We all will never use anything else but a Shark.
1,Dead on Exhumer a big P.O.S.,My husband thought this would be cool as heck to have with the features and finally tracked one down. 5 nails into using it for the first time one claw snapped clean off. Biggest waste of hard earned money ever not to mention costing him down time on the job. Didn't even scratch the paint on the hammer part and its worthless. Thanks a bundle for producing a HUGE P.O.S. product. He's going back to the inexpensive yet reliable Vaughn.
2,Great author-disappointing story!!,"I've been reading Harlequin books for a very long time. I especially like reading books by most of the popular authors but this book by Cait London was so disappointing that I could not finish it. The female protagonist, Jessica Sterling, is so boring and unpredictable (not in a good way!), that you cannot feel any sympathy for her; the male protagonist is a little bit more interesting, but not enough to make me continue reading. I will continue reading London's books even though this one did not meet her normal standards."
1,BEND OVER AMERICA,"This ""enhanced"" piece of garbage adds four very short bits of film dialogue to already available tracks, proving again that there is no limit to the greed of record companies. DO NOT BUY THIS ENHANCED VERSION. It is a complete rip off."
4,Deluxe Soundtrack,"Rancho Deluxe is a forgotten movie. Released in 1975, it starred a young Jeff Bridges and Sam Waterson and was dubbed as a modern western. The film flopped, as did the soundtrack by Jimmy Buffett. It is the only movie score that Mr. Buffett has done (although he has subsequently written songs for movies like Fast Times At Ridgemont High) and the subject was perfect for his persona at the time. The soundtrack is nicely repackaged and remastered by MGM and contains snippets of dialogue along side Mr. Buffett's mix of country & folk. Good stuff."
4,Raw Buffett In All Its Glory,"This is an album to complete your Buffett library. All tracks are raw and old school Buffett. If you like Before the Beach (High Cumberland Jubilee, Down to Earth) then this is a good one to have. This album, however, is not for the ""Fins,"" ""Cheeseburger"" lovin' fan. If you've never been to ""Dixies Diner"" then you might want to avoid the ""Rancho."""
1,Very dissapointed,Not what I expected. I expected songs by Jimmy Buffett but got a bunch of mish mash ttttttthat was not good.
3,Delux Rancho Delux,I was very happy to get this after many hours searching for several of the songs. They are worth the effort.
5,dozens of dolls,"This book is full of excellent costumes to fit every ocasion, and use. Balls, walks in the park, traveling, court presentations; ""George and Jane"" are prepared for it all. The dolls have been great fun and very useful for everything from period dioramas to costume ideas. Even the undergarments on the dolls are apropriate for the period. Certainly my favorite of the Tierney's I own."
2,The illustrations were okay...,"The dresses looked like they were hanging off the arms on some of the illustrations, the figures were drawn a little out of proportion. The dress details were lovely."
3,Lovely pictures but a lot of guessing without captions,"I enjoyed this book, but it would have been really helpful for the author to have just given a couple of lines on each page to describe the outfits. For example ""Silk ballgown, 1812"" or ""Muslin pelisse 1815,"" would have made this book more than just a child's cut out toy. Just a few words on the page would have made all the difference and given this book historical weight...and a fun learning experience. A real shame."
4,Cases on Commercial Law,"The book is a law book, case study method. A decent book. This copy predates a changes in the law that are relevant to the law."
3,NO ROXY OR ROCK MUSIC HERE. 19TH CENTURY INSTRUMENTALS.,"I EXPECTED TO HEAR MANZANERA AND MACKAY ROCKING OUT ON THESE CHRISTMAS CLASSICS, BUT YOU WON'T RECOGNIZE THEM ON THIS CD. THE PLAYERS PROVIDE AN OLD FASHIONED INTERPRETATION ON INSTRUMENTS RARELY HEARD IN THIS CENTURY. A PLEASANT LISTEN WITH THE TREE LIT UP. I PURCHASED 5 COPIES FOR CHRISTMAS PRESENTS."
5,Hammer of Thor,"I can't imagine ever owning a different brand of hammer than this Estwing. It's solid, so it'll never break, it fits perfectly in your hand and the balance is superb. It also makes a very impressive pinging sound when you hammer nails, sounding like the Thunder God working at his anvil. Do yourself a favor; if you're buying hammers, buy Estwing."
2,Stick With The Original,"I enjoy all sorts of stage shows, and have an ever-expanding collection of soundtrack CD's thanks to Amazon, but there is just not much in this sequel to the original. None of the songs stick in your head once done listening. I give the show's creator an A for effort in the liner notes for his enthusiasm (he gushes about how good the show is), but in the end it's one show you probably won't listen to more than once."
2,Great while it lasted,"Finally bought an AIW 9600 AGP Board (Retail Pack). Paid almost $200.00 and thought the good times were coming. Asked for help with installation (Friend a real expert with computers) and carefully followed the installation directions which were vague at best. After many frustrating hours, card worked for a few hours and then the TV Tuner just stopped working. Nothing, I repeat, nothing including a total re-installation worked. No help from ATI. Downloads (Drivers) very confusing and no tech assistance. What a nightmare. Never do it again."
4,Good Horn - Great Price,"This was a replacement horn, and there are only two manufacturers who make this model. This one was well-packed, easy to open, easy to install, looks great, and works fine."
4,Satisfied with purchase,It is a little noisey and slow when you open and close the tray as it cylces through and searches the discs each time. Other than that it plays real well and has nice features.
3,Pleased but not sure it will last as long as our previous Sony,"We purchased this item to replace a Sony 5-CD disc changer that we had been using since 1986. The item was shipped from an Amazon partner, but it came in a timely manner and was easy to connect and begin using. We had a problem with the Random function at first, i.e., the CDs wouldn't move properly. It seemed to calm down the next time we used it and has been fine ever since...hopefully we won't have a future problem. There is quite a bit of clunky noice when the CDs shift, but it isn't much different than the 5-CD disc changer that we used to have. While now all is fine, it seems likely to us that it won't last as long as our last one since there is more complexity to the 7 disc changer. Having said that, having 7 is definitely better than 5. Give it a try!"
4,Country Western Version of Wagner's Ring (?!?!?!?),"Poor Wagner -- First Anna Russell makes a career of telling an accurate version of the Ring and getting her biggest laugh when she accurately says ""I'm not making this up!"" and now this. Don't mistake it for a highlisghts disk of the Ring! This is the country-western version of the Ring Cycle set in cowboy Texas and is, in its way, a pretty good telling of the Ring Cycle. I doubt it is going to convert a lot of country fans to Wagner, but if you like Wagner at all, it is a very, very funny retelling of the Alberich/Wotan/Brunnhilde/Siegfried story set to country music. It was a fun stage show (presented in Seattle when the Ring was being produced) and the album captured the goofy spirit of the show. This is a good album for folks who don't always take their Wagner too, too seriously. It is certainly good for a couple of listens, so enjoy. The Amazon sound clips are pretty representative of the show."
5,Good adapter!,"I used this adapter for my marshalltown fresno, works great and fits on my poles very easily and quickly."
4,The borderland between the occult and true crime,When I discovered this book I was immediately excited from memories of the extraordinary 'House on the Borderland' and the evocative but arduous challenge of 'The Nightland'. Hodgson is a true visionary with imagery that has a vividness unusual for his time (in my experience any way).In this collection of short stories you will find occult stories that hinted at Charles Williams. But there are stories reminiscent of Conan Doyle too. The fact that both of these were mixed in the one volume was somewhat unsettling in that I never knew whether I was reading a detective story (and they are ingenious) or a true dip into the occult.other recommendations:'The House on the Borderland' - WH Hodgson'The Nightland' - WH Hodgson'The Place of the Lion' - Charles Williams'The Devil's Pool' - George Sand
4,good stories stories,The Casebook of Carnacki the Ghost Finder (Wordsworth Mystery & Supernatural) (Tales of Mystery & the Supernatural)by William Hope Hodgson; this was my first exposure to Hodgson and I found it very satisfying reading... this book was a series of short stories featuring the ghost hunter Carnacki relating his adventures to his friends. Several were found to be hoaxes... but several were not.
2,finding what?,"mostly it turns out not to be supernatural. the first story is a beauty. the stories have lousy climaxes, built up sometimes too slow, more unnatural than mysterious."
4,Sneakers,These walking shoes are very comfortable. I work at a school so I am on my feet most of the day.
1,Just say no,"Smoker from the get-go. Has an ice-crushing speed, but I don't think so. Fine, I guess, if you're just going to make non-frozen, thin things."
1,Dangerous Defect in Mine,"Yesterday, while I was in the living room I heard a sudden loud whirring sound, coming from the kitchen. I was home alone at the time. The sound was coming from this blender, somehow it spontaneously turned itself on and was operating at a very high speed. I purchased it about a month ago. Thank goodness I was home. Hopefully these machines don't pose the danger of causing a fire if left on for too long a period of time. I am returning mine. Please beware. I am now unplugging all my counter-top kitchen appliances when they are not in use. I don't think quality control in manufactured goods is what it used to be. With so many items being manufactured abroad, one wonders if some of those countries have quality control standards that exist in the US. Another example is the Dell laptop PCs which have batteries that spontaneously combust. Dell has a huge recall going on now."
5,Best thermo book,"The best part of this book is the examples. There are plenty of examples to teach you the process. The exercises are well designed. I've used other thermo books, and I always come back to this one.The book is laid out so very well. First it teaches control mass applications, then moves on to control volume. It is a damn shame that the book has not been updated since 1977, but then why ruin a good thing?"
5,Wonderful story.,I loved this story about how an elderly lady influenced a young woman in a wonderfully positive and beautiful way.
5,Sarah's Song,This book is very good but all of Karen Kingsbury's books are. You feel like you are there with the character.
1,Haven't read yet,I understand that this is the first of other books by Ms. Kingsbury. I Hope to read all of them.
3,"Second thoughts on whether this is ""it""","When I first bought this book and tried it, I was impressed, because my husband and I both suffer from heartburn and the recommendations for the types of foods we should avoid, DID help. BUT...it didn't answer all of my questions as to 'why' this was happening, and I hated that I could no longer eat peppers and hot foods and certain meats and on and on and on. I lost a ""few"" pounds, and I felt..eh, ok but not great.I was advised to read ""Dr. Gundry's Diet Evolution"" by a dietician friend of mine, and FINALLY, I got the answers I wanted (yes, you can find it here on Amazon).I have recycled the blood diet book -- it's not the whole story, in my opinion."
1,from the editorial review...,"""Nobody spends more time on his knees than George W. Bush.""True that! LOL!!!"
1,What Rubbish,"This DVD is bad enough to convince me to write the only review I have ever written. It seems to be intended for a really uninformed audience of beneath average intelligence. The dubbing of G W Bush (God Bless his deceased intellect) is atrocious and painfully ""door to door"" salesman in it's presentation.The documentary rambles on in the most horrific and laborious monotony of a preacher suffereing from an overdose of anti depressants and the only message appears to be an extremely unconvincing argument that the current President is the absolute epitome of Christian graciousness and self suffering.What absolute rubbish. Anyone who finds this work of any interest or value really does deserve to be forced through the entire excrutiating experience of watching the film from beginning to end.The only thing I liked about it was the relief that it was not too long and that it did, EVENTUALLY, come to an end."
1,Offensively Bad (and I believe in God!),"Unintentional comedy. The people who made this ""documentary"" should be ashamed of themselves. The Bush administration is the most spiritually empty group of profiteers I have ever seen. And I am not an atheist. I believe in God. I believe George believes in God. I also believe he will go down in history as a lesson to future generations about the dangers of unchecked power, arrogance and greed. If I set out to make a satire on the GOP and it's pact with organized religion, it's distortion of what true compassion is, I couldn't have done a better job. I want to show this film as a comedy to friends. My only question is, how do I get a copy without having a nickel go to the people who made it? I have to stop this review so I can get down on my knees and pray that the wave of hatred coming over me will pass! I know I'll feel better tommorow because I plan to help someone less fortunate than me. Not bomb them."
4,interesting,I home school my kids and wanted a video that would show them how Christian values in the White House are beneficial to our country. I was surprised at how much I learned from this video. I did not know a lot of how deep George W. Bush's faith is. I enjoyed this video. My 10 year old did as well. It really got her interested in politics. I am glad I purchased this dvd.
4,Good movie. Great soundtrack!!,Good performance by Mick Jagger as the out law Ned Kelly. Compelling story of the conflict between the poor Australians and the lordly English. The best part though is the music. Irish ballads by Mick Jaggger and ballads by Waylon Jennings and Kris Kristoferson make this worth buying for the music as well as the movie. The sound track is worth buying separately too.
3,GREAT SOUNDTRACK!,I bought this video for the Waylon Jennings soundtrack. The songs are SUPER! But the movie had too much violence for my taste. So I will look for a Waylon soundtrack CD just to hear the music.
1,Grossly inaccurate,"I'm an Australian and have been researching Ned Kelly for 25 years. I watched this film at the movies when it came out. It was terrible then, and is even more terrible to watch now. If you are interested in the Kelly Gang, there are some very good books: recommended ""A Short Life"" by Ian Jones. See if Amazon has it! It is a very accurate account of the life of Edward Kelly, which is more than I can say for this movie."
3,Kelly YES..Jagger NO,"as a straight forward attempt to tell Kelly's story it succeeds. but Jagger, sadly, is Mick Jagger, not Edward Kelly. Unartistic as a film, it nevertheless tells a great story quite well, and i must confess, whenit first came out (1970) it started me on a Kelly quest that has lasted ever since. So BRAVO for Tony Richardson's attmept....and I like Mick and found SOME of his work here ""ok""...but if you watch a movie on Kelly and can only see Mick Jagger, then the casting director should be fired!!"
2,Where's the script?,"There were some good things about this movie: the photography was nice. The action scenes weren't too bad. I somewhat liked the music.If only there had been a real screenplay to hold it all together. I can't tell whether the acting was any good, because they had so little to work with. As for historical content, it's amazing that so much of it was incorrect, given how little of it there was.I'd recommend this only if you think Mick Jagger looks good with that beard. Otherwise I'd say buy a book on the Kelly gang if you want to learn more, buy the soundtrack if you want the music, or watch the Heath Ledger version."
5,Marked as a child,"I first saw this movie as a small child. Now, 3 decades later, I have been unable to forget it.An Australian legend, similar to Brittain's Robin Hood, or America's Jessie James, ""Ned Kelly"" is a shockingly graphic depiction of freedom and justice.Waylon Jennings and the soundtrack music is unforgettable. While having an aversion to mick jagger, I believe he contributed much to the feel of this film, and this may be his finest performance."
1,A Big casting mistake,"Ok, the only reason I watched this was because I'm a big Stones fan but I didn't really expect it to be too good or even memerable and its not. One thing is that I read somewhere that Ned Kelly was a big guy, about 200 pounds, and so I don't think Mick Jagger was a very good pick for him since Mick is so skinny. Another thing is the beard. It just looks hideous. The accent Mick puts on is also hideous, anyway, he mumbles the whole way through and his acting is VERY flat. The other actors weren't too good or memoralbe either. The script must not have been too hot because the only scenes that I really remember are the wrestling match and the end when he gets captured. If you want to watch a good movie with Mick Jagger in it watch Performance instead."
3,don't expect any Big Aqaee,"He looked like he had a good time making it, Seemed to fall asleep while viewing from time to time.t"
5,Kelly music rings true,"The making of the movie caused something of an uproar in Glenrowan Town - Mick Jagger, a skinny pommie rock singer playing our Ned, a true blue big fella Ozzie bloke. Forget the movie, this soundtrack has been ringing in our ears ever since. No other music has captured the essence of the people, places & history of the stringybark country as this soundtrack has. Shel Silverstein's words & music, Waylon Jenning's gravelly voice & Kris Kristofferson's 'The Kelly's Keep Comin' - its said to this day on the ranges between Benalla and Glenrowan a tall shadowy figure walks thru' the mist of each dawn clanging in his armour, laughing deeply . . . rings true"
4,Kolpin Seat cover,We installed this seat cover on a Honda rancher and am happy with the fit. I was a little disappointed in the velco fastening straps and would have preferred straps with the plastic snaps that you can pull tight. The covers are comfortable to sit on and provide great protection of the original seat cover.
3,cover,got the cover from ups opened it up and it looks great put it on and its kind of wrinkley but we will see how it holds up to the sun and weather
1,These Don't Fit!,Bottom Line...These covers don't fit any ATV. They are too small for even a child size ATV. I contacted the store and got NO response! I bought 2 of them and was out a lot of money.
2,a first view at Object Oriented Programming,"If you are already used to program with the OO paradigm, this book is not for you. It's a first approach to what is oo programming and there are only generalities. The major default of this book is it's too old. Java is not even listed in the history of OO languages. UML was not yet invented, and a lot of concepts explained here have changed or are now out of date. The concept is good because it focuses on learning OOD and makes it distinct from learning an OO language which only is the tool. But if you are a beginner, you can find far better book. Not enough examples in this one. And the given examples are very simple and with no interest. This book only gives you a broad picture of what OO is and never really enter in the detail. Nothing really concrete."
5,It's the hammer Grandpa used.,"My Grandpa used one of these near every day. I use it near every day. Great balance, surprisingly little shock through the metal, can swing this thing all day long without missing a beat. The leather wrapped handle lasts YEARS. In fact, I still have my Grandpa's hammer at home. Bought a new one to keep in my truck... it's my go-to hammer for near all framing, finish work and general mayhem."
1,Too Lite,I have the 12 oz leather handle rip claw hammer I had for several years and decided to purchase the 16 oz hammer and well when it arrived it looked good but I noticed that the thing felt no heavier than my 12 oz and after weighing it on a set of good scales it was only 1.6 oz heavier than the 12 oz hammer just the handle a little longer and after contacting Estwing they don't want to do anything so if you are in the market for one don't expect it to be 4 oz heavier like it should and Estwing does not really give a hoot.
2,Not for Floor tiles,"I needed to trim a broken floor tile with a curved cut on it. Upon receiving this item for my dremel, it pretty clearly said (NOT FOR FLOOR TILES). Awesome. Wish I knew that before I ordered it. I used it anyhow on the ceramic floor tile; Not surprisingly, It didn't cut."
3,Decent Cutting Bit,"I had to cut a couple of tiles, and bought this bit. Like the many other reviewers, this bit worked well for the first tile, and basically wore out after a 12' of cutting. At this price point, I really wished the bit would have lasted longer. Would recommend this only for small quick projects."
3,just no use for this,"just could not find a use for this bit, of all the tiles bits i bought i just did not need this, the grinding set i bought did the job better........cuts way too slow.."
4,I Don't Use It the Way You Might Expect...,"I work with plastics and aluminum a lot.I've discovered that this bit is great for punching small holes, grinding inside-edges to precision-shapes and rounding outside corners. I use a battery-powered rotary tool, hold it like a pencil and gently carve into the materials.If you're a computer case-modder, you may find it an indispensable aid.Beware that plunging the spinning bit quickly into plastic may generate enough heat to lock it in. The trick is to take your time and carve away a little bit at a time and if you're drilling a hole with it, to use a slow in-out motion."
5,Perfect price.,I opted to pick this bit up online instead of hitting the local stores. The price was also a deciding factor. The price was 10% less on Amazon as well. I use this bit primarily to cut patterns into terracotta pots and it works perfectly.
5,It works great,Dremel 562 Tile Cutting BitThis bit did a better job than I expected in making the precision cuts that I needed .
3,Good price quick delivery,Bit was a good price and arrived quickly. Used the bit for one tile job and the bit was burned up. I was able to finish the job but after just a few tiles the bit was not cutting very good.
2,"It works, just not too well.","The bit grinds rather than cuts. Cutting a 3"" notch in a piece of porcelin tile took about 30 minutes. Very tedious. I would think there are better alternatives."
3,EdUK for kids,I would consider the book just somewhat interesting for someone studying this type of educating.
2,Needs work!,"I bought this book and the teachers addition at the same time. The information is useful but the presentation is impossible. It looks self published, needs editing, re-organization and much better design/graphics. It looks like a 3rd grader but it together. My son is 4 and reads at 5th grade level amoung other things. I am always looking for good information to help his development. You will find some here, but struggle to but it into an organized structure for presentation to your child."
5,Particular emphasis is placed on learning to focus upon the most refreshing and nourishing aspects of all that surrounds one,"Vietnamese Buddhist monk Thich Nhat Hanh (whose commitment to nonviolence prompted Martin Luther King Jr. to nominate him for the Nobel Peace Prize in 1967) presents Touching Peace: Practicing the Art of Mindful Living, which continues his testimony concerning how to extend the benefits of the meditation discipline into one's day-to-day life. Particular emphasis is placed on learning to focus upon the most refreshing and nourishing aspects of all that surrounds one. Chapters include ""Love in Action"", ""Sangha Building"", ""Realizing Ultimate Reality"", and much more. Written in plain terms accessible to readers of all backgrounds, Touching Peace is a useful and practical guide for any who would strive to find harmony and balance in their lives through the tradition of mindful living. Also highly recommended is Thich Nhat Hanh's previous testimony on mindfulness, ""Being Peace""."
3,needs help,"The message is priceless; however, it takes too much mental energy to stay focused. It would be be better if a clear speaking actor recited the message - like Ben Kingsley or Liam Niessen."
5,Highly Recommend!,Excellent read. If you are on the path of self discovery and/or peaceful living on Mother Earth I rerommend this. Also could for meditation ideas.
4,Excellent sound,"The sound is excellent for a boom box, and the fit, finish and feel of the unit is tops. My only criticism is that both the remote and the unit are a bit skimpy on the number of buttons, only the minimum number are on the unit. The remote is sufficient, but you will have to read the manual to figure out all of the functions."
4,JVC Could Have Done Better,"The system is very good in soundbutdon't use them outdoor during winter it does not work when it's cold.blasting the volume makes CD jump due to vibrations8 size ""D"" battery don't last longscratch easyjust be sure you don't drop them accidentally - it's not worth it to fix em"
3,Good brush,The brass brush worked well. The only problem is that the brass thread tends to fall off even when operate at the recommended speed.
2,"It works, but wear safety goggles and a welding mask","DANGER! I bought this to use with my Dremel to clean my golf clubs at the end of the season. It does work for cleaning, but it's like a brass bristle machine gun! The second I touched it to my first club, I took a bristle about 1cm from my eye, which scared me enough to dig out the safety glasses. The glasses helped but I was constantly feeling bristles bounce off my cheeks and arms. It just ended up not being worth it and I switched to a regular brush and towel."
2,Don't forget the goggles!,"I agree with the others that this simply sheds its skin in a matter of seconds. I tried it on a low RPM and at a higher RPM and it sends metal shards hurdling at your face on both settings. In case you were wondering, ALWAYS wear protective gear. I do need this for polishing certain things, and it does do its job. But I now keep two on hand when working on a project."
2,Pro Tools Surround Sound Mixing,"This book looks nice when you look at the content on the nett. But when you get the book it is a disapointment. There are a lot of pictures and litle text on each page. But since I also has read ""5.1 surround sound"" there was not any new information what so ever. It does'nt go very deep at all, you would be better off reading the protools manual to get the same information. I would recomend buying this book insteadSurround Sound, Second Edition: Up and runningIt's much better!"
3,"Plain unit, short on the details","Easy setup, although you have to be patient during the auto mode. Universal remote was not so universal. It had a short list of supported TV's. JVC's answer was to try all the codes and hope for the best. The unit construction was not impressive. If you are using the unit with a cable box, the AUTO clock feature can not be used and the manual setup does not appear to have a battery back-up, which could lead to frustration with power interuptions. Picture quality is good, about the same as the Toshiba SVHS unit I purchased eight years ago."
3,"Great CD, docked two stars for...","...the worst and most insulting liner notes in the history of recorded music. Every member of the All-Starr band from '92 is a great musician, but you'd never know from these wise-guy, unfunny liner notes. These musicians deserve better, Ringo deserved better, and you deserve better."
3,"Not a bad book, but title is misleading","This is an interesting book and full of facts about the history of Arizona but the title is misleading. The author does not cover the history of the state, It would be hard to imagine that anyone could in a small format paperback with about 170 pages. Instead there are about 20 brief chapters each briefly describing a specific event or topic. For example there is a chapter on the Bisbee Deportation and another on Higher Education in Arizona. The topics are sporadic and probably reflect areas that interest the author. If you really want to learn about the history of the state, Sheridan's book ""Arizona"" is a much better source. Trimble's books are also good and often entertaining."
1,Not a history and most certainly not well written,"As someone who will shortly be moving to Tucson, AZ, I thought it would be nice to know at least a little history of the state and what to expect. While this book has a few interesting facts and does cover some historical material, I have to say it is the most poorly written book I have ever read. It is littered with typos, grammatical errors, and outright mistakes. It also appears to be not the product of the author but a compilation of essays by his graduate students (whom I dearly hope will never graduate!). There is no consistency of style and chapters are disjointed and poorly put together. Whatever institution of higher learning gave this guy his Ph.D. should hang its head in shame. Honestly, a sixth grade class project could have put together a better work than this."
3,disappointed,I bought this set to add to an existing set of the same design. The quality of this set is nowhere near as nice as my older set. The pattern matches but the quality is less than great.
3,Grinds!,hooray. It grinds just as it should. But it cannot make a cup of coffee. You can live with that.
1,NOT 8-pack as advertised,"Watch Out!! Not a 8-pack as advertised. I only received 1 so I called DS Homesolutions...they went through a long song and dance about it being Amazon's fault (which I don't care who's fault it is), then finally agreed to issue me a full refund . We'll see if I get the refund, or if I have to initiate a chargeback. Either way there's no excuse for this.Still no refund!! Do not purchase anything from this seller as they will tell you one thing then do another!I can't understand why it's still listed as a 8 pack since Amazon and the seller have been notified weeks ago."
5,Its Great,"I have always loved Brown Bear but this takes it to a whole new level adding the God touch just makes it wonderful to own, share at Sunday School, etc. Its catchy just like Brown Bear and you find yourself repeating it over and over."
1,Not happy,If you believe in fine print I didnt see it on this cd. The songs that are on this cd are not the original recording like it might lead you to believe.
3,Buyer Beware!!,Be very careful when ordering this particular item. I was not aware that some of the tracks on the CD were sung by someone other than the original artist. The description gives the impression that all of these are the original recordings by the original artists and that just isn't the case.
3,It Works,"Used the diamond wheel on small glass tubing to see if it would cut well. It did cut, but not even close to the clean cut I was looking for, also slower at cutting then I expected."
4,Once a cut up ------ - --- --,I like almost everything about it except the diameter could be a little bit bigger. Works great on everything I tried !
4,nice little tool,"I have been using this for a few years and have been happy. It does seem very accurate, really to the point I can use it's measurements to cut trim, not just as rough measurements. My only gripe is it measures in feet and inches. So instead of reading 55"" it would read 4'-7"" Not a big deal, but not the way we normally measure, so it takes a little getting used to."
4,Ashtray for cars,Very good ashtray - fits in rear cupholder of my Mercury Marquis. The light is a very nice feature for night smoking
1,Completely wrong picture,The picture for the item shows a brushed aluminum looking ashtray which is why I bought it in the first place. The item I received however was solid black. If I wanted black I could have bought one locally for $5.
1,They lied.,"It should fit any cup holder. Wrong! My cup holders are adjustable and this ashtry dosen't fit #$&!. My first TypeS is much better, but has no light. This one is to short and has little capacity. I improvised by cutting a foam can drink cooler to the level of one of my cup holders. The tray fits in well. So,I use one by day and the other by night. I do like the light, but if I had not found a way to use this ashtray, I would have giving a zero."
3,OK for the price,"Needed a router bit for a single project, so the price was right, about a fourth of the price of a similar bit for a standard router."
2,Learn At Home Series,"Re: Learn At Home Grade 6: The reading list suggested was not very good - rather out dated...The social studies curriculum focuses on United States History, which is a 5th grade curriculum - at least it is in Texas. The science curriculum was not in line with what is taught in the sixth grade either. Overall, this book was a waste of money. I would not recommend it."
1,None of this garbage worked! Save your hard-earned cash!,"I was truly dissapointed with this book. Not only did it have absolutely NO results, I threw $12 right out the window! If you want real magic, try ""Voodoo, Spells, Incantations, Potions, and other works of Magick, both Good and Evil"". That book had it goin' on. But this? There aren't words to describe it's lack of effectivness. (P.S.: This book got 1 star from me because Amazon doesn't have a lower rating available.)"
5,Great Book,"Bob Brier is a great author, and I would recommend him to anyone interested in ancient Egypt. This was a interesting read and I have had a lot of fun trying out some of the spells."
4,Easy & pleasant,I found this book very easy to read and understand the Egyptian life for anyone who has no particular background in ancient Egyptian history and magic.
2,Where's the Heka ?,"Pardon the 2 star review but if you're going to write a book on Egyptian magic you have to mention the god Heka of magicians and wizards, and his magic which is also called Heka. For a quick lesson type in ""Heka Egyptian"" at google. I do have affection for this book but it is also dated but for a pleasent little romp in introductory Egyptology, give it a ride. But don't look back !"
2,mine does not work very well,"I got this to use as a GP bit, as it is sold, and have tried it on wood and plastic. In both instances it did not cut very well when trying to move through the materials, vibrated excessively, and jumped around quite a bit. I would not buy another until I figured out if this one was broke or I was using it improperly, and it could be operator error as of now. I would say to buy with caution, don't have to high of expectations. Also, for the price its almost not worth it to send it back to Amazon. Would not buy as gift."
2,Doesn't work at all.,"I've used this on several different kinds of matterial, including pine (which if you've never worked with it, It is extrodinarily soft). I tried to do a plunge cut and had to turn off the tool and rush water to the scene because the wood stared smoking! once I got it through it made the most horrible screaching noise! In the end I gave up using it and bought the XPR Multisaw."
2,Not sure about this one...,"I really had a difficult time controlling this bit, and probably only used it twice. Even at low speeds I just couldn't get it to do what I needed. I have to admit that I am not a Dremel master by any stretch. Good news is that the part is tough and sharp. Someone with more experience could most likely use it effectively. I did have great luck with Dremel 114 High Speed Cutter, also here on Amazon."
2,Bit broke very quickly,I used this bit in my basement remodel to cut a hole in my air ducts to add more lines. The bit broke after cutting two holes.
3,Sizing issues Email issues,"The sizing on these are all wrong. They do not fit properly even after my careful measuring. I ordered a size large, when I should have been ordering a size medium. Sure, it fits my hips ""ok"" but it's definitely not clingy near the crotch or thighs.When I tried to exchange the item for a smaller size I never got a return email with an RMA (return merchandise authorization) and they do not answer their phones.ETA: I received a replacement pair rather unexpectedly in the mail today, and while I'm very happy (and they do fit, yay!) I still wish they'd answer the phones and emails.) I'd change my rating to a 4, but it doesn't allow it."
3,The Fox Westerns w/John Wayne,"I bought this for my husband because he is a John Wayne fan - I was not happy to see that most of the movies were black and white, I did not realize that they were that old."
3,Poor Quality,All Movies stopped at approx. 1 hour into the picture. You have to restart them. I watched other discs later and had no problem.
5,John Wayne an American Hero,"I bought this movie for my husband as he enjoys John Wayne movies, especially he wanted North to Alaska and the rest were a bonus. North to Alaska is a light hearted, fun movie."
4,"is it a book about "" principles of digital behavior"" ?","I seldom get a book which can reflect the rapid change of the design methodology. But I do think other books written by Gajski are very excellent. So, after I reading this book, I will post more detail review about it."
1,Buy the Newer Translation,"Wallace's translation of Hegel's ""Encyclopaedia Logic"" is terrible. Buy the newer--and much more faithful--translation by Gereats, Suchting and Harris, available through Hackett Publishing Company."
3,This stereo makes me laugh,"this stereo, lol. i would expect more from jvc. i think the MXGT700 has alot more bass and more proformance than this thing. i mean 4x4 6"" subs cant stand up2 2 7-7 8"" subs and the giga-tube."
4,Great price,Such a deal on this mat. This is a great brand that will stand the test of time. There are cheaper ones but they need to be replaced more often.
3,Smelly!!!,"Product is great, but it has a horrible smell. I tried the suggestions on the OLFA website but didn't seem to make a difference. Product works though."
4,Great mat,"This mat works great. It seems to really be ""self-healing."" I thought that it would be hard and wouldn't bend. Instead it is thin and seems kind of flimsy, but I guess that makes it more lightweight. I wish that it was a little more sturdy. But this works great. It fits perfectly on my Cosco long table that I do crafts on. I'm happy with my purchase."
5,incense reminder,"This scent is really different, and I have tried a lot of colognes. It reminds me of when I go to church on Christmas Eve, and the minister swings the incense burner around. It is a very calming scent not to be worn by teens. If you are over 30, you should try it!"
5,Signature scent,my hubby loves it. and i love it. not overpowering but definitely has enough kick! his new signature scent! fast shipping too. will definitely buy again!
5,sooooo freakin good!!!!!!,"the first time i sprayed this cologne, i kept sniffing my shirt for the following 2 or 3 hours... enough said?"
4,Nice but beware its sweet,This is nice cologne but very sweet too sweet for a mans perfum John Varvatos its better than vintage...
2,Who Lives in a Pineapple Under the Sea?,"Yes, Varvatos is high on the tres chic list. However, as Varvatos Vintage is advertised, I did not find it to be ""woody, warm, elegant"" at all. I'll agree with the ""fruity"" part of Vintage though, as in pineapple! In that I've never aspired to smell like a pineapple, I'll pass on this fragrance."
1,Disappointed.,"I checked this product out at a Nordstrom, tested the sample, and fell in love with the smell. I decided to not purchase it at the department store and went to Amazon. At first I was skeptical of the price Amazon was charging but realized it was being shipped from Amazon so it had to be the legit product. Item shipped quickly and well packaged. Unfortunately I was disappointed by the smell due to its strong alcohol content. It sure wasn't the same and the smell didn't last long. I went to the department store to retest the scents and it was obvious from not only me but my girlfriend as well, that the smell was not the same. The Amazon version had too much alcohol, and well, smelled cheap. From what I understand I can not return this product to amazon for a refund/exchange due to be a fragrance, and in the end (for the first time) I am no content with my amazon purchase. :("
1,Great Disappointment,I thought that I could save a few dollars(40%) by buying this product on-line as compared to a department store. I found that the product once sprayed on would last only a few minutes... the blend is heavy on the alcohol and short on the oils! I wont make this mistake again!
4,ONE OF MY FAVS,"Wanted a different smell for my boyfriend as opposed to everyone and their brother who wears Aqua di Gio or Dolce and Gabbana Light Blue, etc.. He has gone through 3 bottles of this and we both still love it. Very masculine with a sexy edge.. not soapy or musky. Very nice fragrance. Would recommend if you are looking for something a little less mainstream!"
2,Cheap product. Wires fly off even at the lowest Dremel speeds,Must be made in China. Not even near as good as Dremel brand products. Do not use unless you ware real good protective glasses
2,Intermittant connection = terrible,Do not buy this piece of junk. I recently set up an office for one of my clients and I wanted to save some money so I bought the less expensive linksys WRT54G and the matching linksys pci cards with speedbooster. This set up has not been consistent since day one. I am replacing the entire thing with a netgear router and netgear cards.
4,Excellent Card,Typical of Linksys products this is a simple reliable card. I installed it in my Dell XPS in under 15 minutes. A bit of simple configuration and I was up and running on my network.Well worth the money
1,sucks,i got such a low signal that i decided to buy a patch cable and run a line to my room . i shouldve done that in the first place and saved some cash
3,Thoroughly adequate,"Good price and quick ship from Deal Barn.I don't think (but don't quote me) that the Boost thing works on Vista / Win7. Just XP/2K, according to one of the blurbs on the box.Like another reviewer or two mentioned, I got a number of exceptions and crappy, non-working installs using the included CD and the Linksys instructions. So I just uninstalled the whole damn thing, removed the driver, turned things back on and let Win7 figure it out. And everything worked fine. I wish I had done that the first time.Net - perfectly good hardware, supported in Windows better than by the proprietary driver / network manager. Not an -n card, but only $20. Works better than my Dell 1450 USB piece of junk adapter that it is replacing."
2,Linksys SRX Network,"Have setup three wireless networks. Couldn't have setup the Linksys w/o prior experience. Setup wizard didn't complete installation. Op System is plain vanilla, MS XP home w/ current windows updates. Item had generally poor documentation. A ""quick-start"" guide would have been helpful. Very good conductivity and speed once operating but harder than it should have been to get there, not user friendly."
3,Speedbooster works ONLY with Speedbooster accesspoint,"It works fine as a 802.11G network adapter. The 35% performance gain ONLY if you have a Linksys Wireless Router with Speedboost (makes sense). I was told that the adapter by itself has a 35% performance boost... NOT TRUE... TRUE if-and-only-if used with a Linksys Wireless Router.Checkout Linksys info by doing search for Speedbooster.Not slaming it; just be aware that by, and of itself, speed boost does NOTHING to help."
2,Linksys Quality is terrible,"As a field technician of my own corporation. Linksys over the years has been doing a terrible job on all of there products. Very terrible quality and compatibility. I recently bought quite of few of these wireless N and G network cards for customers and hand hardware errors after install. (The blue screen of death) I will never recommend or buy another linksys network card again. There routers are O.K. but those to are getting made with poor quality also. I will recommend D-link and NET GEAR. These campanies make each product so simple to install and the software that comes with there products are amazing, so is the quality. Hope this helps.."
1,Worthless item,"Despite other reviews warning me about this item, I bought it anyway because I have a Linksys wireless router. I thought that they should communicate without much trouble. Wrong! After several hours of fussing around trying to get the Wireless-G PCI card to function properly, I finally gave up. It is now sitting on my shelf. I couldn't find the receipt for a return, so I view this as a total waste of money. As an alternative, I bought a competitor's card, and it worked right away."
1,"Wow, piece of junk","This card is really bad, i missed up my computer made it very slow. Couldn't make it work at all till i removed the software that came with it and let window manage the wireless connection but now my computer is very very slow it take about 10 minutes to start. Save yourself the trouble and buy a different brand."
1,Only gets one because there's not a rating lower,"Absolutely the worst wi-fi product I've ever had the misfortune to try to run. I'm tech-savvy, but that only works when the product is marginally functional. The card can see the wireless network, tell you all about it (SSID, Channel, etc.) and absolutely refuses to connect (associate.) The ""SecureEasySetup"" is a joke and the antenna is long, inconvenient and apparently serves no purpose except to make the card look like it has something to do with wireless.I'm in the process of returning the entire Linksys network I purchased (router and two cards.) Linksys support was insulting and the quality of the product was non-existent. Buy ANYTHING else."
3,"XP USERS, DO NOT INSTALL SOFTWARE ON DISC","Do not use install disc to install driver. I did as cd said and installed software before I plugged in the card. BIG MISTAKE!! The monitor program that comes with install disc made my system freeze repeatedly. When it wasn't frozen, it ran extremely slow. After researching the issue, I found that you should just plug in the card then have windows find the driver on the cd-rom. Do not use the install feature on the disc. It will save you tons of time and frustration. The card works and has no trouble finding my Airport extreme."
4,"Worked, but then...","O.k. for three years this product has worked. Recently our Apple AirPort router died, so we replaced it with a Netgear ""N"" Router. This router is working fine for two of our home computers (both Apples). However, the Dell Desktop using this Linksys Wireless-G cannot connect to the Internet. Spoke with the Netgear folks, they DO NOT speak English very well - that was fun and time-consuming. The problem was not solved and they said to call Linksys who informed us that our Warranty was up (we knew that).Right now we see Netgear working (service stinks!!), and Linksys has worked but...what to do? Anyone have this issue?"
3,Know The Minimum Requirements,Easy installation and works good out of the box. I ended up having to redo my network because I did not pay attention to the mininum requirements. This card requires a system have a processor of 500 MHz or greater. (I originally planned to install in a 333MHz system) I also ended up purchasing the WRE54G range expander because every time we used the microwave I would lose my connection. So know what system you have and where you will use it!
2,"Encountered problems with Windows XP Home, SP2","Overall I was pleased with this network adapter (connected to a Linksys WRT54G wireless router) and it was working well...that is, until I installed Windows XP SP2 (service pack 2). Once I had installed SP2 the connection died. After a call to tech support I was told that the latest drivers for the network adapter weren't compatible with SP2 and the only solution was to uninstall. The rep said that he wasn't sure if Linksys would come out with drivers that worked with SP2 so I had no choice but to uninstall SP2. I find it poor that Linksys doesn't adequately support their product, especially since SP2 wasn't just a trivial release by Microsoft. I have seen some reviewers who got it working with SP2 but from what Linksys told me it sounds like you are on your own if you attempt it!Good product, bad support!"
2,You get what you pay for.,"When I bought this product I had the Linksys router to go along with it on another computer and this wireless card was receiving the signal not even 20 feet away on the same floor, and the signal is only about 66 percent which is horrible, the only thing that helps is the speedbooster but not enough to pay extra for it. This card loses connection constantly, even when I am not on the internet, the signal is horrible and the card itself is flimsy looking. My advice is to get something a little more expensive and spare yourself the personal anguish of this product."
3,Speed boost???,"This card works fine don't get me wrong, but if think it will be any faster than a card without speed boost you will be disappointed. The only reason I gave this a 3 star rating rather than a 5 is that I feel the advertising of speed boost when there is not one is cheating the consumer"
4,Wireless connectivity for hard to reach PCs,"I have an office in my attic space that was converted to living space. But my cable Internet was not strong enough to make a direct connection with the router in that area. Hence, I bought this wireless card for the PC. Though the antenna is not positioned ideally, I was delighted that the hardware installation went so smoothly. However, the software installation did not go as smoothly. I had many compatibility issue and failed starts. Suffice it to say, after some tweaking, I got the software installed and configured without resorting to a phone call. Now it works fine after clicking through some pop-up error screens on startup."
1,Junk!,"I have had nothing but problems with this card! The install did not want to work out, and the speed is not very good at all!"
2,it is not the best Wireless Card...,"You get what you pay for. Speed boost is not working and only with compatible router. The signal reception strength is so poor. i have my notebook's wifi card doing better job than this wireless card with same distance from the AP/Router.Do you want wireless; you get it... performance .. yes it is wireless and can remove the wire in your premisesIf you are not expecting more than 50 feet, use this one or else go for other type of adaptors.. use a USB one would be better than these PCI cards... I will never buy a PCI type card anymore.."
3,"OK, not usual ""Linksys"" quality.","It took me over 4 hours to get this working, and I am fairly tech savvy. Even though it was connecting with a Linksys router, it didn't work after installation. Next, long and complicated story, it messed up the entire network. I had to reset the network on each computer. In hindsight, I would've been better off with a less expensive product (I paid a premium for ease of use). I give it 3 stars, because after resetting my entire network, it's working well now for a few months."
5,Linksys WRT54GS is a snap to install,"I upgraded from a Linksys wired router to the wireless. I had the new wireless router up and running in less than 30 minutes. The wireless notebook is a Sony Viao with a built-in wireless interface. I have the network locked down with MAC address filtering and 128-bit WEP. Still using DHCP with no trouble at all getting IP addresses for both wired and wireless devices. Haven't measured throughput, but it's quick. Very quick on startup, too. I have no complaints about this router at all."
2,It works... kind of,"The card works but DO NOT INSTALL the software that comes with it.Install the care (machine off) turn it on and let windows do its thing. If it needs a driver put the CD in and point it to the driver. DO NOT INSTALL the software.The software eats up memory, refuses to turn off, would not uninstall (even in safe mode), randomly lost network connection (even though it said it was fine), and resulted in many other problems in the registry and network devices.Good work Linksys, or Cisco."
4,Good card from Linksys,"Pros:- Easy to install- Work well with Vista- Good price from amazonCons:- Do not see advantage yet from SpeedBoosterDon't worry, it works with Vista. That's make sure you do exactly the installation. SpeedBooster is useless, but generally it does good job in main function."
2,"Easy to install, couldn't keep connection","When you get the correlating linksys speed boost router, you do get the advertised 50mbps.I found it fairly easy to install.Once setup though, I found I lost the wireless connection. I would then have to drag an ethernet cord from my computer to the router, and go thru the wizard to re-set it. This happened probably once a day for a week.A 10 minute hassle that I wasn't willing to go on with. I still am not sure if I should blame the card or the routerAlso, I use my computer for gaming and decided that 50mbps wasn't good enough for me. (ironforge lag anyone?) So i returned the wireless card, and kept the router. I'm using it like a regular-old router with an ethernet, and it works just fine."
4,Watch out for System Requirements,"Amazon said that this card is compatible with 95SE, that is why I bought it:Features:Compatible with Windows 98SE, Me, 2000 or XPYet Syslink driver supports only Windows 2000 or XP:WMP54GS - Wireless-G PCI Adapter with SpeedboosterDriver Date: 4/28/2005Driver Release Version: 3.100.46.0Driver File Size: 6.02 MBDriver Operating System: Windows 2000,Windows XPUnless you are running 2000 or XP do not buy this card. It is not supported for other Windows systems."
1,"If you have Windows 98SE, look elsewhere!","I spent 4 hours trying to get this card to work with my pc... I called Linksys to see if they could help... well after 5 minutes of quick tests, the operator told me that they have had many problems with these cards and 98SE. He had no work arrounds, the only things he could suggest was to return the card & purchase the Linksys WMP11PCI card (as this works well with 98SE). I will be returning this card back to Amazon & be purchasing a WMP11... hopefully I can get this to work."
3,Disappointing product,I bought this because my previous Linksys product (WRT54G router) was great. But I am wrong about this PCI card. It's expensive comparing with competitor's product. The installation process is awkward. Does not integrate well with WinXP wireless control function. Antenna is interfering with other cables. The worst thing is signal reception is really poor even though my router is just one room away. All my laptops are able to get perfect signal at the same spot.
5,Worked perfectly,"A Linksys WRT54GS wireless router is used with the ""master"" computer, a Dell Precision Workstation, and this Linksys PCI card is used within an older Pentium III computer running Windows 2000. I was expecting a few problems with the installation. Nevertheless, everything worked beautifully, and I am able to take full advantage of my Roadrunner broadband with no obvious speed loss. Highly recommended!"
3,a known Installation problem,Installation cannot be done and it is a known problem. This means that you cannot take an advantage of using the speedbooster.
3,couldnt get signal,it wasnt hard to install. but it couldnt seem to get a wifi signal. i dont know it was because of the item or if the signal just wasnt there.
3,Delayed Shipment,"Item was listed as ""in stock"" however, after oder was placed the shipping date was delayed by approximately 7 days. Was not an issue since the PC that it was to be used with was also delayed by a different vendor."
1,Worthless,A total waste of 4 hours. Buy a USB wireless adapter and don't bother wasting your time with this card.
1,Misrepresented Title,"If you're looking for J. Walker McSpadden's ""Famous Ghost Stories"", this ain't it.In fact, there's only one ghost story in the whole book. The title of this book is misrepresented here. What you'll receive is ""Famous Psychic Stories"".The only thing ghostly about this book are the missing ghost stories and the missing dollars from my wallet.Ooooo! Chilling, isn't it?"
2,this is not a music cd.,must have for dead heads but there is no music on this cd. robert hunter reads his poetry/writings. if poetry readings interest you than this is for you. interesting musings from grateful dead lyricist.
5,Passed the test!,"This is the most complete and up-to-date book on PIX firewalls I have read. I looked at the Cisco Press book, but it was way out of date. The Richard Deal book is missing some topics, and isn't enough to pass the exam. This one covers it all, and each topic is covered in detail. I passed 9E0-111 today. Two more exams to go to get my CCSP!!!"
5,Good book for PIX,"Our company uses all of the PIX models from the 501 to the 535s. We are also now using 6.2 I was looking for a book that had coverage on all the models and also was written to v6.2. I got this book, becuase it looked like it would cover all of this, and I just finished reading it last night. The stuff I learned in the book combined with my on the job experience, I now feel like I know just about verything there is. The book was well written with a good level of detail, and it also has lots of output and some pretty good diagrams that help to get the point across."
5,Best PIX Book,"I've read all of the PIX books out there, and while the others are good, this one is by far the best. It is more up to date on the product line and the exam, and it is also a lot more comprehensive."
2,Csico PIX 515 E,"I bought this book to learn about the Cisco Pix 515E but, this book as little to do with the Cisco Pix 515E. I have not found any training material that teaches you what you need to about cisco from to back."
4,Great Looking Shoes,I've owned the shoes for about 2 weeks. Beautiful shoes with exceptional finish. This is my first pair of Cole Haan shoes (I've worn Born shoes quite a bit) and I am adjusting to the fact that the shoe sits lower on the back of the heel of my foot (than the Borns). Lots of support as compared to other dress shoes.
2,Too expensive to just not wear.,"I bought these shoes believing Cole Haan would provide me a comfortable yet stylish work shoe, which is really all I wanted. I wear a 15 EE, so trying shoes on in the store is not an option. After reading other reviews I decided to give it a go. Well, it's been a few months and I'm still not happy with my shoes.From the start, they were narrow as all get out, and since returning them wasn't an option, I just kept wearing them until they finally broke in, which took about a month. The current problem I have is that the ""visible NIKE AIR Technology in the heel"" isn't doing ANYTHING. The sole is HARD, and when I walk in them, I can feel the impact of each step.On the plus side, the leather and stitching is top-notch. However, that's not enough for me. For my next work shoe purchase, I'll be trying a different brand. In the meantime, these are too expensive to just not wear..."
3,A little bit of a let down,"I have owned several dress shoes and buy at least a pair a year because I wear them so much. When I needed a new pair of brown shoes I thought I would try Cole Haan with Nike air. These shoes rub my feet and hurt them, I might have the wrong size but the size down from my normal size felt too small. I have a pair of Clark's ( a lot less money) that are much most comfortable. These shoes really need sizing help."
2,nice but not nice,"nice looking shoe but not made for the wider foot....must be the most uncomfortable shoe that i have paid 100 dollars fot...if you have narrow feet, you might haver better luck...they are sitting in my closet right now after one wearing....thats too bad"
4,Best framing hammer i've owned,"I've been framer for over 10years and used a lot of different hammers.i bought my first deathstick framing hammer about 3 years ago havent used any other brands since.in 3yrs i have broken a couple handles pulling nails,which isnt unusual with any woodenhandled framing hammer over 16""long.since sinking a nail is my first objective i concern myself more with a hammers ability to drive nails. the sweet spot on this hammer is awesome.it feels like you hit nail deadcenter on every swing."
2,loved it until.....,"i really liked this hammer....until i tryed to pull a stubborn nail. crack! the head separated from the handle. tryed fixing it with wedges and epoxy but it was toast. i had the same thing happen with the stanley fat max look alike.as a professional carpenter, the value of a good hammer is tenfold. i have given up on wood handled hammers and have found the perfect hammer in the stanley anti-vibe with solid steel shaft. about the same price as the estwing, but better ergonomics.the only wood handle i would be willing to try is the hart. but until i lose my anti-vibe, i wont be trying another."
5,One of the best puppet books ever written!,"I have had this book on my shelf for a couple of months and didn't take the time to look at it in depth. This week I have read parts of it during lunch and found it to be one of the best puppet books in my library. True there are no color pictures, but the black and white drawings are very discriptive and thorough. This book covers most types of puppetry and especially goes into construction, which is what I am researching, marionettes in particular. This book is a classic liken unto ""The Dwiggins Marionettes"" but more user friendly...and less expensive!"
3,Re-titling of old book,"When I started reading this book, I thought it looked pretty good. Then I started to see goofy assertions about how the author thought C++ should be coded (which were downright wrong). It makes me mad when people assume that the way to program in C++ is the way MFC is programmed. This book perpertuates this idea. Telling people that multiple inheritance in bad has no place in this book. If the author does not understand the proper use of this C++ feature, then they should not discuss it. It is hardly pertinent to the subject in the first place.I also noticed that the book was originally OLE stuff that has been re-purposed for ActiveX.There are nuggets of information if you want to wade through this book though."
4,OMG I LOVE BROWN!!,"OMG I LOVE BROWN!!The choir scene during the credits was GREAT lol....""Put me on the Program, let me get on the program he was my daddy too"" hhahaha Anyone that is familiar with TP movies and plays knows Brown is SUPPOSE to be over the top, that is his character and I LOVE IT, he keeps me in stitches. I agree that TP needs to come with topics outside of black women being wronged from time to time to keep some interested and bring more people in but personally I have not grown tiresome. I know that if I want to watch a hilarious, feel good movie with a good message in the end, TP is the way to go."
1,Ummm.... No.,"Okay, this one was the worse in my opinion. The first one (diary of a mad...) was the best because the love interests HAD CHEMISTRY! The second one (family reunion) there was a little less chemistry, but there was some. This one - nadda. Angie B. was good in the part of a struggling single mom, but when it came to the romance - I thought she was little stiff. And R. Fox - for.get.it. I mean I know he's not an actor, but dayum! And yes - it was all very, very predictable & wrapped up in a neat little bow @ the end. Sorry, Tyler; I bought this one to keep my collection going, but sheesh."
2,Same Story.... Different Characters,"This is just the same story Tyler Perry does over and over with just a different set of characters. He has another black woman who is horribly mistreated by a man only to be saved by a big muscular hunk. I'm often very unhappy with the sterotypical ways Mr. Perry portrays blacks. The ignorant banter of Mr. Brown sets us back by about 50 years. This time he threw in a loud, obnoxious Latino to add to the sterotyping. I do think I could get over that though if he would come up with a different storyline. I truly don't understand what the love for these movies is all about. They alway deal with poor mistreated woman, a very mean man, a very nice handsome man, a loud obnoxious relative or 2, and a beautiful wedding."
3,kiawest,Meet The Browns was OKAY. I enjoyed it up until the funeral scene. The funeral scene was a bit much and got a little ridiculous but for the must part if you enjoy Tamala and David Mann's performances you'll enjoy this.
4,great,Meet the Brown's was awesome it was a sit down and think hard about it play. If you haven't seen it you got to sit back & enjoy the Browns..:-]
5,excellant.,I thought the Paynes was as funny as it gets untill I saw the Browns.I have never laughed so much in all my life.I love all of them.they are the BEST ever.
1,tyler perry's worst movie so far,"I love ""Diary of a Mad Black Woman"" and ""Why did I get Married"" but this movie lacks in all the aspects of film making. The characters are awful except for Rick Fox's performance and the Mom's son ( unknown). It's not funny at all. It has no heart like his other movies. It's just bad. There's also the annoying Lee Roy Brown and Hispanic lady characters. Bottom line, you are wasting you're money if you buy or even rent this movie."
1,TRULY DISAPPOINTED,"From watching the previews on TV, I expected more from this movie. When it was over I just asked ""Is that it?"". I barely laughed. I'm a huge fan of Tyler Perry but this movie gets a thumbs down from me. Sorry TP."
5,Rock Solid,Very entertaining. Good storyline. Anyone in line with Tyler Perry will really enjoy this movie.
2,Meet the browns was a let down,"The std was not what one is used to from Tyler Perry. I was a little dissappointed in the story line, the jokes were a little excessive."
2,Meet the Browns?We've met them Over and Over again,"First of all,I think Tyler Perry is a wonderfull writer,director,and a great Man who deserves his success after what he's been through .I've seen just about all of his films,and Loved Madia's family reunion.""Meet the Browns"" is not his best work,and its the same type of movie I've seen from him over and over again,and I agree with the other reviewers,Angela Bassett as a YOUNG unwed Mother with 3 kids?one of them under5Years of age ?SHE'S 51!!!,and lets face it,this actress OVER ACTS in every movie she's in.Less is More.I'd like to know what this film is.A screw ball Comedy?A serious drama?Then all of a sudden Madia turns up in a police case for a brief cameo,Then of course you have the wedding like all the other endings of Perry's movies when the girl finally realizes the man of her dreams is not a bad guy.Meet the Browns? I've met them over and over again."
5,another great Tyler Perry movie,"I always enjoy Tyler Perry's movies because of the message he projects.You usually have a woman who has or is being abused, either physically or emotionally. Who is afraid to be emotionally involved in a new relationship with a man, and a man who is patient and Godly. Mixed in with Madea, hiliarious characters, a Christian message of tolerance, grace, unconditional love, and God's mercy. I can't get enough of his movies. You come away feeling optimistic and happy. Keep em coming Tyler.... we love you!"
5,Family,"What can I say, it's Tyler Perry! It was very good and much humor, even though Medea was very much missed. It had its moments where it dragged out too long, but it was more good moments than bad. This had you thinking about how you and your family would act in certain situations. I enjoyed it very much and can't wait until the next Tyler Perry play/movie."
3,It was alright...,"...I saw this about a week ago and I must admit, it wasn't as good as I expected it to be. Don't get me wrong, it had it's funny parts but it wasn't just funny all the way through. Mr. Brown is a fool..he had me laughing but I don't know if it was the supporting cast or what but it really didn't make me laugh out loud alot.I am looking forward to seeing 'Madea Goes to Jail' starting sometime next year. I also want to see the movie version of 'Diary of a Mad Black Woman'.If Madea was in this one, it probably would have been alot funnier to see Mr. Brown and Madea bounce off each other but..without Madea...it was Alright."
4,Classic Tyler Perry,"If you like Tyler Perry movies, you won't be disappointed with this one. The protagonist in this film is a single mom who has to deal with a deadbeat ex boyfriend who won't give one single penny in child support to help her raise their son even though he has a decent job. But bam, Mom comes into an unexpected windfall (a reasonable one) and gets an opportunity to start a new life with her son, and a man who is so much better than her loser ex. Overall great movie, and Madea as always shines in her role."
4,Good Disc,This Disc Captures The Film very Well.Hearing Bobby WOmack Singing the title SOng Alone Still is a Powerful thing to the Ear Drums.J.J Johnson&Band are Great.they capture A Great Feel as well.The Music&Film have held up really well.
5,Great business book about a true legend,"I had read Monica Langley's excellent book Tearing Down the Wall's on Sandy Weill and when I saw this I knew I had to read it too. Since it was a business autobiography, which tend to be poorly written I didn't except much. I was suprised, this book is very well written and a true page turner that I simply could not put down - I finished it in a week.Sandy Weill is the real deal, he reshaped the financial services industry forever. Of particular interest is how he had a falling out with Peter Cohen, Jamie Dimon and later John Reid. It is a shame that like Hank Greenberg, a true legends career had to end under the ruthless self-promoting Elliot Spitzer and sad to read the toll it took on Sandy but like almost all else he has overcome everything and his legacy is one of greatness."
1,Boring and Lacking in Useful Information,"I read ""The Real Deal"" in the hope of gaining insight on how to be a good manager. The book did not help; the main ""insight"" I gained was the suspicion that Weill's success was largely due to his having strong people as operational assistants - eg. Cohen at Shearson, and Dimon at Citigroup.The one other potential insight I took away from the book was Weill's endorsement of requiring top executives to hold most of their stock until retirement (thus avoiding the incentive for short-term manipulations); it was also somewhat interesting (and disappointing) to read of the key role played by politics at American Express while Weill was there."
1,No Deal at All,"For all its girth, this book is shockingly shallow and a huge disappointment for anyone hoping to learn real secrets behind the author's successful business career. There is a lot of score-settling and finger-pointing at those who he felt mistreated him (like proteges Peter Cohen and Jamie Dimon), but very little in 'take-away' value about what to look for in building a successful business. I was reading this book simultaneously with Danny Meyer's ""Setting the Table"" and the contrast could not be more striking. In a much shorter but infinitely richer and more rewarding volume, Meyer painstaking reveals all his business success secrets; the reader feels totally cared for which emulates the experience of being in his restaurants, whereas the Weill volume left me feeling that Mr. Weill cared not one whit for his readers because it imparted so few useful insights."
2,"Me, myself, and I","A self-congratulating collection of ramblings from a king who has been sent to exile by ungrateful underlings. The words me, myself, I and my are the most used ones throughout the book. Any problem that is out there is with someone else."
5,An Unappreciated Album!,"This CD was unavailable for many years. It is superbly recorded with fantastic classics, the best being ""Station To Station"", ""Heroes"" (a rousing guitar piece) and all the ""Ziggy Stardust"" classics. If you've ever wondered how a slow song like ""Warsawza"" could have ever been good in concert - just take a listen. It's hypnotizing! This double CD is tough to find and will not last long here at Amazon, so I recommend getting it while you can."
4,Get it this time if you didn't on Ryko the last time...,"Of the two re-releases (David Live and Stage) this is the one to get if you did not get the Rykodisc incarnation early in the last decade as David Live is readily available in its older form. For some reason, the late 1990s reissues skipped the two live albums, excepting the ""Station to Station"" live version that made it onto the Christiane F. soundtrack reissue. Do you really need a synthed up version of ""Ziggy""? If you need ask this, you should have just stopped with ChangesBowie or another best-of.Why is it only four stars? I don't understand why the decrease in the quality of packaging for every release since Aladdin Sane. Both of them (Ziggy and Aladdin) were in hardcover book forms and this one, I can see why it was only fifteen dollars due to the crap packaging. Still, Bowie before 1985 is like pizza. Even when it's bad, it's still pretty good.Signed,epsteinsmutha"
2,Adrian Belew Ruins This!!!,"This live disc set is ruined by the horrible ""playing"" of Adrian Belew. He stunk up both Zappa and King Crimson, and DB made one of his few band leader missteps in getting him to play on this tour. His inappropriate noises are total buzzkill. Hopefully, he is back playing in that Nasville bar from whence he crawled from. AVOID!!!"
5,David Bowie: Stage,"For the real fan this is the very finest live Bowie that you legally buy. Bowie at the very height of his powers and I'd at say at most most interesting. The incredible take on ""Ziggy Stardust"" alone sells the record."
2,don't waste your time,If you are serious about your camping then go and get a decent tent from one of the more specialized retailers like REI. I have had tents like this and I can assure you that unless you are absolutely cash strapped your money is better spent on a more durable and feature rich product. ...
1,This is the worst tent I have ever owned.,"This tent is not waterproof by any reasonable standards. All of the seams and zippers leak. After setting the tent up with the rainfly, the tent continually leaked for over fourteen hours forcing me to sleep in my car. I suppose it is a good thing that I had not hiked twenty miles into the woods to find this out. The tent was quick and easy to put up. I put it up in about four minutes. The opening in the tent is rather hard to get in and out of if you are tall. I am six feet tall and hit my back coming in and out of the tent opening every single time. The zippers were caught on the tent most of the time and took a bit of time to untangle. This tent is mediocre if you are expecting dry weather."
3,Missions life,"It's an OK book, however not what I was looking for. Covers a lot of the practical aspects of planning a mission trip which is important."
3,Good sound quality but lousy electronics quality,"I must say that this system is loud, and clear. But, I had to send mine back 2 times. First the cd player stopped working after 6 hours. It wouldn't even spit them out or anything. Then the second one had a problem with the amplifier and would only put sound out to one side.(yes I switched the wires to confirm it was the amp) After all that trouble the system is very slow and must be given ample time (10 sec) to complete any task thrown at it (changing a song). Like I said good sound but lousy electronics quality."
1,not great,"The sound didn't stand out at all, and the components used to assemble it were VERY poor.For using the JVC name, this was real garbage; a huge let down."
3,Whole V Parts,"I thought that on the whole it was a good movie, worth watching, unless you want torrid love scenes and people droping dead ever five minutes.It's a good Winter movie."
2,Would not recommend,"Interesting concept, but boring. Fast forward through most, even with impressive cast. Not very entertaining, depressing actually. Do not recommend."
2,Stellar cast can't enliven this dull film,"It is amazing that a first-rate cast (Aaron Eckhart, Ian McKellen, William Hurt, Nick Nolte, Jessica Lange, Britney Murphy, Alan Cumming, and an interesting premise on paper can turn out to be such a sleep-inducing film, but ""Neverwas"" is just that. The film was made in 2005 and never got a commercial release and was eventually shown on a cable network. Eckhart plays a psychiatrist who accepts a position at a mental institution where his father committed suicide. There, he reconnects with friends from his childhood as well as a patient (McKellen) who knew his father well and helps Eckhart undercover buried secrets, among them the secret fantasy world that his father created in a popular book. The film has a colorful visual style but it is not enough to bring any interest to this terribly boring film. Eckhart and McKellen are fine in their roles but actors like Jessica Lange, William Hurt and Alan Cumming are wasted."
2,Umm....,"I haven't made up my mind about this movie yet. My first thought was ""this is one of the worst movies I have ever seen, it is so stupid."" But at that time I thought the movie was a fantasy, by the time I got to the end and realized it was much different than I expected, I thought ""I would have to watch it a second time to really appreciate it""... unfortunately the movie is not good enough to waist my time on a second viewing."
3,NEVERWAS IS!,"A movie with a developing plot that unfolds in its own time, Likable characters, a few interesting twists and turns, almost a child's story, but very much adult. Worth a watch."
3,Narnia Like Movie,"A Narnia type mix of psychology and mental illness situations that provided for an interesting movie. Nothing to write home about, however, was not a waste of time either."
5,worth getting it from Amazon,these are one of the best chocolates I have ever tasted and they're not too expensive. comes about 1. 25 a piece. NOT BAD
2,Seemed like a great idea at first.,I am remodeling my basement and a have lot of dry wall to cut. Using this bit seemed like a great idea at first but after having used it a few times I quit and went back to my dry wall saw. The bit had a tendency to wander and produce very inaccurate cuts. The accuracy of my cut outs is far superior with my hand held saw and quicker I might add.
3,"""Number One Super Guy""",If you're a Scatman Crothers super fan like myself you'll probably find this book a little lacking. Still a fine read and definitely worth checking out if you have even a passing interest in Mr. Crothers. I just wish it was a little more in depth.
2,Scatman: An Authorized Biography of Scatman Crothers,"Scatman is a very good book at the begining but gets reallyboring towards the middle. I think whoever wrote the bookshouldn't have concentrated on so many dry facts in Scatman'slife, by telling more of a story. Everytime the writer attemptsto tell stories in the book it's interesting but evertime hekeeps refering back to small details that shouldn't have madeit in the book. The most interesting thing that I learn in thebook is how Rap (Hip Hop of Today)has been around for decades!Back in the 1920s jazz musicians where using a style referedto as scat jazz in which they used their voices to make soundsof various instruments. This required a great deal of patienceand intellegience to come up with a style like this. As blackmale I think this is a good book to read for this month BlackHistory month to let us know what types of racisms we as a peoplehad to face to accomplish things in the past."
5,Great Deal,"I saw this exact hammer in a home improvement chain store for ten dollars more than what is asked for it on Amazon. Estwing manufactures a quality product, so long as you stick with the made in USA models. This hammer is very well balanced with enough weight to drive the nail for you. Excellent all purpose model and I am very pleased with it."
3,Great hammer if you are deaf,"I bought this hammer from the big box chain, and now realize I did not get a top notch deal. However, the hammer does exactly what it is supposed to do, drive nails all day. The handle is comfortable and the head is such that nails don't automatically cave over. In short, it would be a pleasure to work with if it wasn't for the ring. Every whack it goes ""poiiiing"", and drives me batty. I just replaced the nice new shiny non marring non bending Estwing with my old trusty Stanley that bends nails all the time, just because I couldn't handle the tuning fork noise. I tried winding electrical tape on the handle, the stem or whatever and could not get rid of the noise. I know it is kind of ""soft"" to complain of noise of a hammer, but this is just too much.If I was deaf however, or enjoyed wearing earplugs, this hammer would be impossible to beat.What hammer should I get now?F."
3,An Australian Master,"Twenty-odd years ago a Chemistry professor friend gave me a story--an essay, perhaps--by Walter Murdoch. It was about visiting an island in the South Pacific, inhabited by the descendants of late-nineteenth century English immigrants who had been shipwrecked on their way to ASustralia. I have told people--students, other friends--Murdoch's story hundreds of times, from memory. The photocopy Tom Dunn had given me was long since lost, so I decided I to let Amazon find a copy for me. This volume of selected essays is what I got--and it's a treasure. Walter Murdoch is a writer we need to rediscover. I would recommend his essays to anybody who likes to read and think.Bert Hornback"
1,Didn't use this product because my Doctor said it was for women,I went to my Doctor with this product. He advised me to not use the product because it causes a female hormone to occur.
2,Definitely not DURABLE ...,"Think of the cheapest plastic possible and this is what this item is. Two weeks after I bought this, it cracked in two different spots, both at the bottom edges.So - why buy this?? Unfortunately - there is nothing else for this phone..."
4,Excited,I bought this clock for my stepson because we were redecorating his room in oakland raiders and he absolutely loved it of course he is a big Randy Moss fan.
4,Satisfacory product,"I have been using LVC-9006 VCR / DVD Recorderfor about four months. My major problem withthis product is its remote control. It issimply not the kind you expect to see in 2005.The physical layout of the remote is fine.But, the buttons on it are too tall (about1/16th inch) with sharp edges.It is NOT one of those remotes that youcan sweep its buttons easily with your fingersand find the button you want quickly.Its too bad that such good unit gets rated basedon poor design of its remote control buttons."
2,Recording problems,This maching worked great until 1 month ago. I've had it for 16 months so it's past warranty. Only records 1 out of 10 attempts. Very frustrating.I'm not sure if it's worth getting fixed.
2,Help???,Can anyone tell me how to take the counter/timer off? It only records in 30 miinute intervals then I have to hit the record button again...Help!!Thanks
1,Wonderful beginning -- miserable ending,"For the first 12 months of ownership this recorder worked great in all respects. I felt I had a winner. Its on-screen ""Easy Guider"" system made it a snap to operate. I was happy. But in the 13th month (it had a 12 month warranty) it stopped dead in its tracks and couldn't be budged to do anything. The unit's front panel display read ""Hello,"" but didn't proceed beyond that. I couldn't play, record, eject my tape cassette or DVD disk, and I could not even turn the machine off unless I disconnected the power cord.When I asked the Lite-On support team for help, I was told to return the unit to the store where I bought it for repair. The store told me to return it to the manufacturer. After 13 months of ownership with light usage I'm stuck with a dead machine. I'm not happy now."
1,A Piece of Junk,"I was happy when I first bought this. I made 10 DVD's without a problem. Then the DVD recorder started making junk. I had to pay $38 to return it to the manufacturer because it was still under warranty (I bought the extended 2-year warranty)When I got it back 8 weeks later, the VHS wouldn't play right - the picture jiggled from side to side so badly I couldn't watch the movie.To get it fixed I had to pay another $38 to return it to get it fixed (it was still under the manufacturer warranty). It's only beenI WILL NOT BUY ANOTHER LITE-ON PRODUCT - EVER. I WILL NOT ORDER ANOTHER PRODUCT FROM AMAZON.COM. If I can't get the merchandise from a local store, I just will not purchase it."
1,Junk,"I installed all of 12 rivet nuts with this before it broke. And by broke I mean the cheaply made item simply spread apart no longer pulling the rivets to crush them into the hole that was drilled. Then bars that pull the head wore a grove in them and then the tool actually started to fall apart. I took it apart to see if I could squeeze the sides together to hold it, no good since the metal lugs that are inside won't stay there. Cheaply made chinese junk...save your money and time, get a good one, unless you only have to install 5 to 10 rivets, then throw it away, might work then. Guess you get what you pay for."
4,Nice product if it had what was advertised,"This product worked as intended. The only problem was I needed the 10-24 insert and it was shipped with two 10-32 inserts and no 10-24 insert. It took an extra day to receive the correct insert, but the Surebonder sent one out immediately without question, and they were super to work with."
4,Quality system,"We just got this system for Christmas and we are impressed. It is going to replace both our clock/radio and our stereo in the bedroom. So far, it does everything we want, and has features that are not listed in the description. Those features are: a full function remote control, timer and sleep timer. The timer works just like an alarm, but it only 'wakes to music' not a beep or buzz.Some negatives - we lay our unit horizontal. We couldn't see the clock when it was vertical. Also, the button labels are in an a red. I would prefer a less bright color."
5,Phenomenal,"Urban's history is at once a sound history and a suspenseful, compelling read. The author documents the achievements of George Scovell, one-time apprentice to an engraver, who rose through the ranks of Wellington's Army to be responsible -- no-less than more famous actors -- for the British victory over Napoleon. While the history examines Scovell's masterful feat of ingenuity, it also narrates the events and context of military engagements throughout the campaign.This underappreciated gem gets an enthusiastic five stars."
5,Nothing like it,"Gene LeBell's ability with the club, nightstick and pr24 will surprise some people but anyone who has trained with Judo Gene knows that his knowledge of all aspects of combat is the equal of any teacher alive. Combining grappling and police application with stick use is innovative and has applications for all martial art systems."
3,Gene Lebell,"Gene Lebell is truely the grappling master, His expertise is shown by all of his accomplishments. To learn from him, even through a book, will surely help you become a winner in the ring. Buy this book to further your knowledge of grappling"
4,Great for Dog,"I have small dog and these Greenies are the perfect size for her. She is a super picky eater, but she really enjoys chewing on them and I hope over time they improve her breath. Some days it could knock you over :-) I know all the chewing will be good for her gums."
5,Great Doggie treat,"Keeps my dog entertained as well as not so smelly.My dog always wants to eat the cat treats I feed our cat, so I got her some Greenies too.She likes to play with them as well as eat them.They are like an edible chew toy for her.A nice treat!"
5,Crowd Pleaser,"Greenies are the house crowd pleaser...my westie, who is NOT food oriented, will pull out every trick in her repertoire before I can ask to get one of these. My lab starts to drool when he sees one. My shihvanese practically does back flips! Everyone loves greenies. I like how they leave my dogs' breath sweet smelling and teeth clean. Easily digestible, senior formulas with joint help, great on their digestive system, just a great, great product! Can't recommend it enough.I will say though...if your dog is a gulper, please make sure you watch them while they eat/chew. They seem to like it so much that you really need to be on hand just in case, as is true with any chewy product for your furkids!"
4,Teenie Greenies,"So my dog has very bad breath lately. We are schedulilng her for ultrasonic teeth cleaning next year to see if that helps, but in the meantime I was looking for something that made her breath more tolerable because it was starting to smell like her poop. While my dog, a 5 year old bloodhound and 65 lbs is not a teenie dog, I wanted to get the teenie greenies so they were like cookies to her. I was surprised to find they did work. After about 5 greenies her breath did improve. My only compliant on these would be that I wish they had a grain free option since my dog does develop ear infections if she eats grain. But, breaking her off the grain to give her these for her breath was well worth it. She seems to enjoy them and she's pretty picky on what she eats so to dogs they must be tasty!"
5,Great treat for my dog!,"My little dog loves these greenies, and they're great for his teeth. He loves to chew on them while relaxing on the floor."
5,Informative and FUN - what a concept!,"I bought this book for a co-worker who just had a baby, and he loved it! It's loaded with valuable information, but it is still incredibly easy to read (unlike some reviews I've read recently). The tone is light and playful, but the message is a serious one. It's well-organized in easy-to-reference chapters, and full of practical tips that just might not have crossed the busy new parent's mind. While it doesn't profess to be the only reference a first-time parent needs, it may likely be the easiest one to fit into her busy schedule!"
2,Disappointing,I grabbed it thinking it would be a fun read. Not much useful information. Others in my playgroup felt the same when I showed it.
2,Saris Cycle On Rack,"The bike rack is fine, although surprisingly heavy compared with others of its ilk (Thule and Yakima). The value of this rack lies in the rock solid mounts for any sized bike along a fixed run tray. The front wheel adjusters are excellent and solid. My only complaint was discovering that the box was missing dozens of parts that had to be ordered from Saris directly at a cost of $58. Amazon offered no help even though it was their fault that the parts were missing. Ultimately Amazon credited me for the cost of the parts, but it was nearly 4 weeks before I had both a functioning rack and at the price I paid for it."
5,JAG on DVD,"When will JAG be released on DVD, I have been a huge fan from the start and would love to own it in my DVD collection"
5,JAG -A-HOLIC,"JAG is probably the only show I have watch consistantly since Season 1 through to season 8 (including the pilot episode). I have been through them over and over again. I too hope that Hallmark in the UK will continue to show JAG and buy the rights to season 9. Please, please, please can we have DVD's of the show."
5,gotta love it,"Watch JAG faithfully every noc--reruns on week nights, current episodes on Tuesday. Never get tired of it. Would love full video collection as well as other JAG memorabilia such as hat, shirts or ????"
5,MOAWB - Mother of all wrecking bars!,"This wrecking and pry bar is a beast.Strong reverse angle on the cat's paw end that enables easy pick-prying.Long and strong.This is thing is like a poor man's halligan tool; big, mean, capable, and a good equalizer if you find yourself in a rumble with something that doesn't want to go your way."
5,The Mother of all Wrecker Bars,"This bar of steel is a real tool. It is heavy, but it has to be. I removed 850 sq.ft. of decking with it. It was not easy, but would have been impossible without the wrecker bar. It is a tool in equal stature to visegrips and duct tape."
4,Big & Sturdy,"I was trying to match this product to one I already had, this one turned out to be bigger and sturdier than I was expecting."
5,Not for the weak,"I purchased this tool and was surprised it was made in a town across the river from where I grew up.But I digress.Upon recieveing this tool I was amazed at the weight. This is not a tool for light duty work. If you need a top quality demolition hand tool and find yourself bending crowbars, or find that they never are angled correctly, then get this item.This tool should last a lifetime.I purcahsed the 48"" variety."
5,great movie,"I love this movie, always would watch if it popped up on TVGrant and Dunne act very well together, there is a good chemistrynice comedy with a cute ending -recommend to anyone who likes Cary Grant and/or Irene Dunneand to those who have not seen them act together beforequality of DVD is very good, picture and sound quality"
5,One of my favorite movies of all time.,I discovered this movie at the libary in Washington state. I have watched it with my daughter's over the years. My youngest daughter told me a few weeks ago that she hoped to have her own copies of all of the old movies we have shared together. This is a gift for her.
3,Good up until the half.,"I checked this movie out of my local library and I found it to be enjoyable, up to a point. It opens with a courtroom scene in which Cary Grant in his role as a lawyer is petitioning to have his wife declared legally dead since she's been missing for seven years with no word of her whereabouts during that time. He is doing this so he can marry again. Well all goes well, until his first wife returns! And right in time for the honeymoon too. The movie would be strong except that about midway through Cary Grant's character gets alarmed when he learns his wife didn't spend seven years on an abandoned island all alone. His reticence to believe his wife remained true gets to be a drag throughout the film. However, there are some cute scenes. One scene takes on a different meaning than intended now that the orientation of both male protagonists is known. Nonetheless, the movie is enjoyable. Although, the viewer will be ready for it to be over when it ends."
5,Color?,"The 5 stars are based on faith. I haven't actually watched this dvd or read any review about it, so this is just a speculation, but I'm quite sure the copy on this dvd will be a B&W, not a hideously colorized one. The dvd of Destination Tokyo, belonging to this same collection, includes indeed a black and white copy of the movie (according to a review I have read in the Home Theatre Forum), even though it's advertised as ""format: color"" in the Amazon description.I am convinced there is a mistake in the Amazon description of this dvd, and the format is B&W and not color. If someone could confirm this, the matter would be put to rest. It would be a shame if sales of this splendid dvd were to suffer because of a simple confusion like this."
1,Cary Grant NOT at his best,"I love Cary Grant movies, but this one was a huge disappointment! As he finds himself in the predicament of just having married the second time, then his first wife who has been presumed dead for seven years shows up, what is he to do? He dearly loves his first wife, the mother of his two children, but he can't bring himself to tell the second wife. He is spineless and the biggest wimp of a man I have ever seen. Not the Cary Grant I know!"
2,I hate to say it...,"...but this is a pretty weak movie. I'm a huge Cary Grant fan and think his charisma, versatility, and impeccable comic timing are justly legendary. My Favorite Wife just barely slides by on those strengths, along with Irene Dunne's charm. The writing is clunky, clumsy, and--worst of all--rarely particularly funny. The situations in this movie could have been flat-out hilarious but instead only manage to be mildly amusing. Unless you're a Grant completist, there's no rush to get this one. (Just wait until TCM inevitably airs it again.) There are many far funnier, better scripted and directed Grant comedies.2.5 stars"
1,"Huh? Colorized Version? But Why? Shame on You, Warner!","I was about to order this one until I read the comments by the reviewer from Holladay, UT. Just proves you have to carefully check out the description of a DVD before ordering. I couldn't conceive that this film would be released other than in black and white.What could Warner be thinking by releasing the ""Crayola"" version? Didn't the studios realize a long time ago that their experiment with colorization was a big disaster?Amazon.com should provide reviewers with a ""0-stars"" option to deal with situations like this one. Being forced to award Warner 1 star for this tragedy is very painful."
1,Too Bad It's Been Colorized,"I can't believe it! One of my favorite Cary Grant movies, finally released on DVD, and they chose to use the colorized version!!!WHO WAS THE MARKETING GENIUS THAT COME UP WITH THIS ONE?I love this little movie, but now I'll have to take a pass on buying the DVD.Sorry Warner Home Video, you messed up on this one........"
5,I just love Carey Grant,"Movies today just seem to a lot of ""In your face"" action, that is one of reasons that I so much enjoy older movies like ""My Favorite Wife"" with Carey Grant and Irene Dunne.Lawyer Nick Arden (Carey Grant) is man with a serious problem. On the day that his first wife Ellen (Irene Dunne) was declared dead and he get remarried to Bianca (Gail Patrick), Ellen shows up a live and well after being stuck on a south pacific island for the last seven years. Needless to say comedy happens as Ellen tries to reclaim her husband and family.Some viewers will relize that ""Move over Darling"" with Doris Day and James Garner is a remake of ""My Favorite Wife"" but let assure you ""My Favorite Wife"" is much better due the acting of both Dunne and Grant and should not be missed."
4,Travel Agency Necessity,"With the increase in the number of gay/lesbian travelers and the vast interestsof them, it is important that every agency have this book on hand to assist inthe planning of tours in Europe."
4,If only it was a full season release,"I remembered watching ""Naked City"" reruns late at night on a local NYC station when I was younger so when I saw that some episodes were released on dvd in a ""best of"" format, I thought I'd buy a set and refresh my memory. I've been hooked ever since. This is a great show, and a great showcase of '60s New York. A scene in one episode, not necessarily on this set, was filmed in the original Penn Station. I was born after it was razed and, while I've seen photos of it in books, nothing compares to actual footage. It's a shame that Sony/Columbia has not released full season sets of this show, and that Image Entertainment only released ""best of"" sets. Hopefully someday all 4 seasons of this show will see the light of day on dvd."
5,Great purchase,It fit what I needed to do and it was the right size. It was a great gift from a relative.
4,P.S. I Love You: The Best of the Hilltoppers,i always remember listening years ago and i think the first formation were the best and that they more than held their own with their contempories.it is a very good collection but i still think [untill the real thing comes along which was a hit in england with only you on the other side]should always be included in their best collection.i think they were a college group.anyway thats just my opinion.jeff.
5,there are no more great things to say about EC...,"just read all the reviews of this and his other albums, and you'll see what I mean. but then, when you're talking about brilliant, glittering talent such as Elvis', I suppose it can't hurt to add just a little more praise. I actually bought this album for ONE song... I know, I know, and I have made mistakes before with other artist's albums. the song that sold me was ""poison moon,"" from the bonus disc, and it alone was worth the second investment. But this was far from a mistake--what a smashing second disc we get for very little $$$! included are some rougher versions of hits we already know, as well as some really pretty tunes done in honky-tonk fashion--very interesting. the ""quieter"" tracks give one glimpses of a younger Elvis, and the live tracks transport the listener to a hot, crowded concert hall some 25 years ago. this is brilliant stuff, and not to be missed..."
4,The big debut,"The debut album of my so nerdy he's cool man. Not surprisingly, this is the place to start with when going back to the early genius that was Mr. Costello. ""Allison"", ""Watching The Detectives"", ""Red Shoes"", ""Welcome To The Work Week"" - all the cool tunes are here in their two minute punky new wave glory. Plus it's the remastered version complete with a ton of liner notes and a whole separate disc of rarities. Now if they would only stop re-issuing it every two years I'd be happy."
1,Agreed: Too many versions!,"Sure, it would be nice to have the 2nd disc of live material, but I just can't see buying this CD a third time. Release it separately for those of us who have at least 2 versions of MAIT, or offer a discount or something. Is it any wonder why people don't buy much music anymore? They are too busy buying the same thing, released several different ways. I'm a completist, I have (pretty much) every Elvis Costello cd (most, 2 versions) and I guess I'm just getting tired of this cycle. As far as the music, I'm not even a big fan of MAIT; his work after this is much better."
1,Re-Re-Re-Re-Release? PATHETIC!!!!,"Elvis Costello is my favorite artist. He is one of the most prolific and talented artists in the history of music. An incredible concert performer. Sadly, he has also become a shameless gouger of his loyal fan base. He has re-re-re-re-released his catalog over and over and over again, with slight changes and additional outtakes and versions. It has gotten completely out of hand. Elvis, please stop this nonsense."
1,Yeah...,"This will be at least the 4th time I have bought this album, and I'm buying it because of the live disc. I've bought a lot of Hendrix. I've bought a lot of Led Zep. And I've got a lot of Grateful Dead. But I've never had to resort to buying an album 4 times to get live material before."
1,STAY AWAY FROM THIS EXCEPT FOR LIVE STUFF,Please read my review on the '2007 original' listed elsewhere. The quality on the main LP is absolutely awful. The live stuff is really good.
2,Shame on you Elvis......Music=5 stars...Greed=0 stars,Ok....I've got this record in the following forms1) Original LP2) Box set3) First re-release ( with a 2nd CD of unrealeased material )4) Second re-release ( with a 2nd CD of still more unreleased material.......but pricing this new release as a full priced 2 CD set ???!!!!Shame on you and or your record company.You make great music.....but have a clue about marketing the same old stuff for the umpteenth time....and have a clue about your fan base.Very disappointing.I'll wait for the a used CD version of this.
4,"For a debut, it's great...","...as every review I've read on this CD (Rolling Stone) seems to say over and over. Rhino has once again done an incredible job with reissuing classic albums (not that Ryko didn't), as they are taking their time with EC's extensive catalog. And the songs are great--we even hear a little country on the bonus disc years before he did Almost Blue. The only complaint I have with this album is that it sounds a little too soft-rock in places. I don't lay the blame with EC, though, but with the backing band he used (which later became Huey Lewis and the News...the less said the better). That having been said though, a solid debut followed up by an album I hope Rhino reissues soon--This Year's Model. The Attractions rock."
2,Greedy,I agree with all the other comments. This is a classic album but there is no excuse for $27. Simply grossly over-priced
4,An Intro. to Costello,"This is a quintessential Elvis Costello album. If you don't own an Elvis Costello album, then this album will be a great introduction. Every song is on here is catchy and stands on its own as a rock hit. Costello has a unique style unlike a lot of Rock, yet when listening to his songs I think that this is what Rock and Roll is about. With catchy lyrics and upbeat rhythms, My Aim is True will have you coming back to listen to it over and over again."
3,Rock and roll blasphemy?,"I admit I'm an anomaly...an EC fan who does not love My Aim Is True. I place it high in a second tier of Costello's standard recordings.'No Dancing', 'Mystery Dance' and 'Angels' are in my Top 50 EC favorites as is 'Stranger in the House' from the Rykodisc/Rhino reissues. 'Welcome to the Working Week' is enjoyable. I also like 'Radio Sweetheart' and 'Cheap Reward' from the R/R extended discs.I'm not going to bash the rest of 'Aim'. I simply don't find it as appealing as most of the reviewers here.A final note...Live versions of 'Aim' songs can be found on some of the second discs of Rhino's reissues and the hard to find 'Costello and Nieve'. They are typically superior to the studio versions and are worthseeking out."
5,One of the top 10 albums ever produced.,"There is very few albums that compare to this masterpiece. Every track is superb. One of the top 10 albums ever produced. Intelligent and quick witted lyrics, addictive melodies and clean pure energy, this album has it all.The funny thing is I could issue a similar endorsement for E.C.'s next two albums as well. 1977's My Aim Is True, 1978's This Years Model & 1979's Armed Forces, may very well be the best three consecutive albums ever released by any one artist.Other artists have had larger impacts on our history and influences to or culture (Beatles, Stones & that other Elvis) But for musical excellence Elvis Costello is second to none."
5,Just great songs,"I remember having a very bad image of Elvis, lumping him into the ""new wave"" phenomenon for years. Then I finally listened to this cd. The songs are nothing short of incredible. Not a bad one in the bunch. The production is stark but that just enhances the power of the tunes to stand out on their own without gimmicks. I'm not sure he ever made another album as complete as this one, though I followed him through several more excellent lps. This one's a definite keeper."
5,Opened my doors of perception,"Scene One; A sixteen year old boy is happily sitting in suburban Detroit. The soundtrack to his life is what would later come to be known as Classic Rock Radio. There are rumors of punk rock and new wave from England, however these are not audible yet in the midwest. One Saturday evening, he sits down to watch SNL with special musical guest Elvis Costello. Snap! That was the sound of a dropping jaw breaking the coffee table as Mr. Costello (looking like an exhumed Buddy Holly) plays Radio Radio. Scene Two; Said boy brings home My Aim is True. His mind is blown. Every song sounds like a hit single. He is amazed. Maybe there are other unheard things out there like this. Epilogue; This album helped open my doors to Punk, New Wave, Reggae, Ska, Jazz, Blues, World Music, Country, well you get the idea. Thank you Mr. McManus. One classic album."
5,Great Pop/Rock With Intelligence and an Attitude!,"Dylan may have changed the lyrical content of rock and pop, but I feel Elvis Costello with this debut, changed the song structure of rock. These are punchy 3 minute gems with strong melodies. But it's the lyrics that stick to your mind like a character from your past. The album starts off with ""Now that your picture's in the paper being perfectly admired.."" Well, you know this guy is different..but he writes so good. My favorites are The Angels Want To Wear My Red Shoes, Alison, Miricle Man and Watching The Detectives. But really the whole album is a rock and roll joy! When I first purchased the album over 20 years ago, the lady working at the album store said ""My he looks like Buddy Holly, but his name is ELVIS?...COSTELLO? There's a little bit of all of the best of rock in E.C. If you don't like this album, you are not a true rocker. The new CD sound by the way, is marvelous!"
5,The Angry Young Man Strikes Hard!,"I first heard Allison on the radio when I was 17. I didn't buy the album right away though. Then I saw him perform on SNL. He was supposed to do Watching the Detectives or Allison but defied the tv execs and did Radio, Radio. What a performance! Every song on this cd is true to rock and its roots. Listen to the urgency of Mystery Dance or the rebellious lyrics of Radio, Radio and you'll know right away. This was Elvis first in a string of fantastic albums. I own fourteen of his albums and this is by far one of my favorites. If you want some good time, angry, in-your-face rock, then this is a must for your collections."
5,Pop music at its best,"I am stingy with my stars. But, this could be one of the finest pop albums recorded of its era (mid 70's - early 80's). Each song is perfectly crafted and, like Sinatra at his best, Elvis doesn't linger past the point when each song should end. Another subtle point about the album is that the lyrics are intelligent and dark thus providing a nice counterpoint to the upbeat music. Finally, Elvis brilliantly left his music uncluttered - note that much of the songs are driven by the bass and the drums. The melody was either picked up by Elvis, his guitar or a keyboard. Only rarely was there more than one tenor or alto melody line in each song. Brilliant, simple and soaringly beutiful music. It is one of the few albums that I can listen to over and over again and still hear fresh nuances that excite me."
4,Whoops...I almost forgot to put a title here...,"With Costello, it's hard to know what to take notice of; the words; the music; the melodies; the voice; the guitar playing (hehe).My Aim is True is a really great debut. This album, in its pretty short running time defines Costello as someone completely new, someone who could make rock and roll dangerous, irreverent and literate.This CD, costello's interesting sleeve notes explain that this was recorded in 24 hours of studio time. Impressive effort!These songs are witty and catchy, Costello is a great singer - he's not everyone's cup of tea, but I really like it.My only problems with this CD are not Costello related. First, I'm not a fan of the 'sound' of this CD. It sounds very 'tinny', even for its time.Second, I'm not a fan of Clover, especially its guitar player. This CD is full of annoying little guitar fills that really bother me.Despite this, it's a really great CD. Maybe This Year's Model is a better starting point."
5,Great classic Elvis (Costello that is!),"Terrific album, point of note though on description here... Maybe I've got the wrong cut but listed track 13 (Watching the Detectives) is actually track 7 on my album and other tracks are shifted down accordingly. Just an FYI. Elvis Rocks!!!"
2,OK for the money but there must be a better guide available,"This publication has some useful statistics but falls short on providing essential information such as adjustments for loaders, adjustments for high or low hours, what to expect for hours for a given model year . Information for some models incomplete, for others prices appear to be based on only a few sales or listings."
4,* Kitty devours this flavor and brand *,"I've tried various flavors of this brand and other manufacturers, which Boo (my kitty), wouldn't touch. But she loves the Hairball Solution gel chicken flavor.Those of you who may have a ""plugged up"" cat (if you know what I mean) this product works great as a laxative. Although not right away, within hours your cat should experience some relief. I squeeze about an inch or more in the palm of my hand, and let her lick from there. It was hard for her to eat this substance from a bowl for some reason. Try both ways :)Also, the gel can be difficult to squeeze from tube...I wish the manufacturer would address this issue. Otherwise I would give it five stars."
2,My cats won't touch it.,"Both of my cats have longer hair and lots of it. One was taken to the vet because he got pretty sick. Seems hairballs were the problem. I initialy used petroleum jelly. They won't just take it off your finger so I rub it onto their paws. They hate it, but that's why they lick it off.I figured i'd give this a try. It's flavored so maybe I could spare pissing them off and they would like licking the stuff right from my finger. This was not the case. So I thought, fine, I'll just put it on their paws. BAD IDEA. They slung it all over the walls and my bedding. It doesn't have the same consistency as petroleum jelly.I have been feeding them food designed to help them pass hairballs. There are a few out there and I recommend you find one they like because you are not going to want the hassle of administering this product as many times as you have to. I recommend petroleum jelly in the mean time. Seems the food takes a little time to start being effective."
1,cats hate it,My cats hate this and won't touch it. I hoped it would be a good substitute for the petromalt since they changed their formula but it was not. Please note - I just bought petromalt at the store and they are back to barley malt syrup so my cats are back to eating it.
1,Cats hate it...,"I've tried other malt flavored hairball prevention products from online pet product vendors and my cats didn't hesitate to eat them straight from my finger. I have 7 cats, none of whom would take a lick of this product. Even after putting this in the fridge and mushing it up in the tube before dispensing, the goop is way to viscous and drips right off of my finger, leaving a sticky mess on the floor. I can't tell you how well it helps with fur balls because my cats won't touch this product. I was very optimistic based on the reviews but feel gipped after trying it."
3,"Great Item, but noisy...","This is my second toaster of the exact same kind. I really love all you can do in this size toaster/oven. It is very sturdy and easy to clean. The only down side is that it is really noisy. I thought the first one was a little noisy until I purchased the second one. If you can stand hearing it, it really does a great job with toast, panini, sandwiches, pizza, appetizers, etc...Anna Maria, Orland Park, IL"
2,Not as good as I expected,"This is the first Susan Squires book I read, but I have read many vampire novels, am a big Christine Feehan and Susan Sizemore fan. It was just an okay read, not romantic and a bit on the disgusting side, i.e. too much talk about villianess vampire sucking her victims dry. Oh and there is an ancient vampire who is described as if it is an alien from space. The constant doubt of the character Beth is annoying, she always thinks of herself as unattractive; it gets a bit old."
4,Companion Series,"I have really enjoyed The Companion Series by Susan Squiers! She is a very bold and vivid writer. I can't seem to put the books down once I am started and while I enjoy getting to and knowing how the story is ending I'm very disappointed that the journey is over.Her version of ""vampirism"" is very well thought out and credible."
4,The Companion (Regency Vampire Novels),"I enjoyed reading it, Ian Rufford and Elizabeth Rochewell are characters well defined and the book storyline was reeling in my head (helped by my imagination) like a movie."
4,Read this Second,"I read the series out of order and started with ""The Hunger."" If you haven't read this book yet, I recommend reading ""The Hunger"" first. I enjoyed both books, but ""The Companion"" (first book to be written) is set several years after ""The Hunger."" I enjoyed the writing style, characters, and setting in both books. While the book isn't really a cliff-hanger, she's set it up to continue the story, and I'm looking forward to finding out what happens next."
3,"A good, short bio.","Michael Justin Davis' 1977 biography of William Blake serves as a good, basic introduction to Blake's life and poetry, with brief explications of the major poems interspersed throughout the narrative of Blake's life. Being only 181 pages, though, I felt he needed more discussion of many important topics, sometimes leaving his reader with bare assertions rather than developed argument, and it's sometimes unclear where he was getting his information from. Overall, it's a readable, short, professional biography of Blake, but lacks the personality of Gilchrist's biography or the depth of Bentley's."
4,Replacement for the Lawn Mower Sharpener Kit Stone,I have a smaller yard so I only need to sharpen my lawn mower blade a few times each season but this will only barely last through one of those seasons. Gets the job done though. It is not a perfect system but good enough so that the grass is not getting brown tips from being ripped rather than cut.
2,zipper broke,"Coat is well made except for the zipper. within a week of wearing the jacket, the zipper teeth broke towards the bottom & can no longer be zipped. The jacket was not worn for work, so a lot of tension was not put on it."
3,Fair quality of book; quick delivery,"I can't remember if the condition of this book was labeled as ""fair"" or ""good"". If it was labeled as ""fair"", then it meets expectations. But, if it was originally labeled as ""good"", then I believe this estimate is a little high. It was good enough for myself, but there was an excess amount of highlighting and marking and the binding was broken. Like I said, okay enough for myself, but others may have been disappointed. Overall, I'm happy with the transaction. It was delivered very promptly."
3,Introduces the world to schools of thought,"The history of sociological theory is not exactly the most facinating course material. Even if you have a great instructor, the basic content is both dry and monotone.By intergrating questions of social justice into this text, Collins draws in current day readers. Far from being stodgy, Sociologists/sociologists in the making were some of the world's most visible radicals during their time."
4,A Warning,"I ordered this CD because I thought it would contain The Makropoulos Case in its entirety; but NO, it actually contains only an orchestral suite derived from the opera! So now I've warned you; if you're looking for the whole Makropoulos Case, look somewhere else because it's not here, folks.That being said, the CD sounds wonderful; very well played, so 5 stars for the musicians, 3 stars for the misleading packaging!"
4,"Smoggy, but Gold...","While I do not hear what I have come to associate with with the amalgamated band in this initial release, its sound and its songs are well-done. It is not particularly good for any reason apart from sounding happy, making me enjoy classic rock without deep insight or limitations based on personal dislikes of certain groups. While I'd never buy a Thin Lizzy or Bad Co. album of my own, I wouldn't discredit these renditions for any Jayhawks or Soul Asylum song to take thier places. A good, fun thing."
3,A Delicious Before Dinner Snack,"A precursor to their later super collaberation ""Down by the Old Mainstream,"" this short and fun collection is a rocking must have for anyone whose ever admired the likes of Soul Asylum, Wilco, the Jayhawks, Uncle Tupelo, Son Volt, Run Westy Run, or any other member of the No Depression, Wheatfield Soul movement. Combines the elements of rock, country/bluegrass and others to make a smorgesborg of sound."
1,Poor attempt,"This is an older disk, so do not think that all Golden Smog work is poor. Clearly anything with Jeff Tweedy is of a superior class, and he is not on this album. Buy the newer stuff."
5,Yes!!! Perfect Book!,"Just like the Blues, ""The Language of the Blues: From Alcorub to Zuzu"" by Debra DeSalvo, is the nitty gritty real deal with stories and definitions from Blues masters, not from non-musician researchers who think they're the authorities. This book is informative and fun rather than dry and scholarly. You will not be disappointed if you buy it.It's this type of work that will make sure the Blues and Blues history lives on!"
5,Comprehensive to say the least!,"Being from Chicago, the ""home away from home' of the Mississippi blues roots, as well as being a heavily blues influenced guitarist here for over 20 years, having even opened a show for Muddy Waters, I thought I knew most all there was about blues vernacular. Then I read Debra DeSalvo's ""The Language Of The Blues"" and realized how much I didn't know...This book is the most comprehensive title I've ever read on the blues and the history of the blues. If you read blues history, bluesman's biographies, or are even a scholar of the genre, this book is as invaluable as Roget's Thesaurus to any author.Excellent piece of work and should be required reading in any school of music teaching the blues as the art form it is."
3,OK Book,"Shania is my fav singer right now, and her life is very interesting, but his book is sort of, I don't know, plain. I did a BIO report on Shania, it gave me all the info, but, it's plain. I reccomend searching for another one, but this one's good to. Oh, this book isn't as small as you think it is. It's about 12""x9"""
5,Nice Rack!,"All jokes aside, this rack is a great value for money.When assembled correctly there is almost no wobbling or creaking. The adjustability and number attachments available for this piece are fantastic.Only con (if you want to call it that) is that the pull-up bar is pretty smooth, so when your hands get sweaty it becomes hard to use. (This is just physics though - the bar is metal) You can fix this with some $0.79 tennis grip tape. Just wrap the non-knurled parts of the bar and you've got yourself a perfect rack."
4,Soooothing,A little bit redundant but very nice and soothing. Works great for settling down our new baby.
2,"Drip, Drip..","Not recommended for those with diabetes or enlarged prostate, as they feel the urge to micturate frequently enough as it is."
5,Summer Rain,"This is one of my favorites. If you want to hear rain without any thunder, this is the CD for you. It is very relaxing and starts out as a gentle rain to a harder rain and then back down to a gentle rain again. I highly recommend this one."
2,A do not buy,"Unless you are doing very small projects, this is not the rasp for you. The dimensions are misleading. It is tiny and was worthless for my woodworking need."
4,An Excellent Book by an Excellent Writer,"This is a beautiful, moving story by a writer who doesn't get much attention, but is better at what he does than many of the ""bestselling"" Christian writers in the marketplace.A Lance Wubbels story always gives me the feeling I've learned something important, but haven't been hit over the head learning it. Most of all, I just enjoy his characters and his stories.If you like a good, wholesome story, this man delivers."
2,Only an OK read,"There are better ""friends become lovers"" books out there than this one, although the other two reviewers don't agree...I thought the heroine's reasons for not loving the sexy, sweet and understanding hero-friend sooner seem false. Not a keeper, but, an OK read. I must say that practically no other romance writer can maintain sexual tension between the h/h like Ms. Cresswell aka Jasmine Craig does, which helps raise this story up a bit. She really has a talent for writing wonderful heroes, but her heroine's motivations in this instance needed work."
2,"Good idea, poor execution.","I purchased two of these when they first came out. The retractable cord was great, but I have found two problems with these mice. On one of the mice the retractor mechanism broke. Now, my other one is fine, and I will probably chalk it up to my fater being a bit too rough on it. The other problem is much more annoying, and is present on BOTH of my mice. The problem is with the scroll wheel. The wheel has a tendency to ""stick"" between knotches causing the screen to jump up and down erratically. It is very difficult to use the wheel without this problem popping up. I have never had this problem with ""quality"" scroll mice, only cheap ones. I think Kensington cut corners on it's design. On the other hand, their WIRELESS Pocketmouse resolved both of my issues and is a FANTASTIC mouse."
1,"good hardware, bad XP drivers","Don't bother. The XP driver is beta, and won't uninstall. The first clue something is wrong is the fact that they don't ship software with the mouse, but expect you to download it from their website before installing the hardware. Sounds like they needed a little more time to cook the software to me...but it is still not ready yet! Now my Dell Inspiron 8200 laptop ""blue screens"" several times a day. So I bought a Microsoft optical mouse instead, and now my system thinks it is still a Kensington mouse. I guess I have to reinstall XP to kill the mouse.Save yourself and stay away from this product!"

4,Indispensible slice of history and histrionics,"Uninitiated fans such as myself will find more than enough tidbits for intelligent Zappa chats in the extensive liner booklet (a la ""Yellow Shark). Every track has a background check; these and the description of Zappa's lair (i.e. Reagan reich poster) enhance the experience greatly. This is a nostalgia trip that will engage and corrupt the mind. Fans must have it; nonfans need to be offended by it."
3,For committed fans only,"As a fan of FZ from the late 60's, I found this album to be an interesting curiosity. I certainly wouldn't recommend it to anyone who had not heard FZ's music before, as it is mainly from the weird side of his repertoire. If you have a sizeable collection of Frank's records this one is certainly worthwhile, as it has tracks I had never heard before as well as different versions of tracks I know well"
2,"Cd's fit, but don't hold your breath...",I found this to be a bit annoying. The CD's fit (pretty much) but the pockets were not big enough to put in the CD cover as well. I like order in my life and it is hard to keep all the CD's in an order when you have no idea where the CD belongs once you are finished with it (that is assuming that you have a few empty pockets.So if you like something that you can keep the cover with the CD...look elsewhere!
2,My thoughts of this book,I realy didn't enjoy it that much. When it starts talking about golfing and about the characters its to borring. Well thats my opinion any ways. later on in the book it gets better. Oh ya there is also alot of punctuation eras in it.
1,Mamet is not the talent everyone would have you believe,"After my wife and I forced ourselves to watch the whole thing through to the end, we did a quick mental review of all the Mamet films we could think of in order to try to figure out why we had had this idea he was such a great writer. American Buffalo, The Edge, Oleana (sp?), The Spanish Prisoner and, I think, State and Main. None of them are deserving of the reputation Mamet enjoys. The Spanish Prisoner is mildly interesting, I suppose, but none of the others fall anywhere near the top of my greatest films list.This movie was just a dull action film dressed up (and not very convincingly) as an art film or as something with intellectual appeal. The dialogue gets so fast and furious at points that, if it weren't for the all the frequent repetitions, you'd have to be rewinding all the time to hear what was said.We gave it our best effort, but in the end, we both agreed that we'll pass on any future Mamet productions."
4,Spartan,"I don't usually let good movies like this slip by, but somehow I didn't catch Spartan when it first released. Fortunately I rented it and now I'm here to buy it. Exceptionally taut and rapid developing story never lets up. You will feel you are with Val Kilmer training special forces recruits and then trailing the disappearance of a young girl. Interviews with suspects quickly lead them to a slave trade and then preparation for an overseas flight to take down the gang. News of her death while yachting doesn't ring true when his partner indicates he saw signs of her at the entry point of the slave trade. You best sit tight and pause if you have to leave the room because you will not want to miss a minute of this action thriller. I for one was never sure what to expect next and you may find yourself wondering who Kilmer will kill including his team. I highly recommend it. Good quality DVD with standard extras. If you enjoyed this catchMindhunters.CA Luster"
4,The uses and abuses of media,I went to see this film because it was by David Mamet. I wasn't disappointed.But I really loved the cello theme at the end. Mark Isham has outdone himself. I actually sat through the credits to find out who played the cello; hats off to David Speltz. It's a shame this score has never been released on CD.
3,Mr Kilmer and his lack of expression,"Don't get me wrong; I've been watching Val Kilmer movies since ""Willow"", but it seems the older he gets, the less expression he shows on his face. Is it just me???"
3,Too Extreme,"The corruption was too extreme to be believable, but I'd watch Val Kilmer in anything. I did enjoy the sparse dialog style"
3,"Great movie, middling playback",Streaming gave us issues. Complete stop halfway through. But the movie is great. Terse and tense. Great dialogue from Mamet!
3,very good,"i tried to get this movie for 4 years until now, and it's perfect, the bad thing is that there is no blu-ray format for this one any way it looks great."
4,Mamet can write thrillers as well--yowza!,"This is an excellent thriller mostly thanks to the storyline that takes a few nice twists and the excellent lead role played by Val Kilmer. Supporting cast is first-rate and the tension built throughout the movie is there in spades.DVD is a waste, though, as all you get is a Kilmer commentary track. Rent it don't buy which is why this gets a ""4"" rather than a ""5."""
3,great spy film,"I like the way the workings of ""the unit"" and spy stuff is just presented without explanation. A lot of nods and understood things without abnormal explanatory dialog explaining everything that would never occur in real life unless they were in the presence of politicians, managers or other complete idiots. It's a very good spy film, believable and shocking. Makes old Jack Baur look like a Boy Scout, which is a good thing. They didn't have whoop-de-doo electronics that are fake (like 24 does some), and wild fire ball explosions that are fake (like 99% of Hollywood movies). It was good, I enjoyed it. Val is always excellent."
2,cryptic messages,"Roger and Ebert loved this movie. I cannot tell you why. Val Kilmer plays a secret agent in charge of rescuing the President's kidnapped daughter. Derek Luke is kind of like a partner. On their way, they discover that this was a conspiracy that started at the top, in the White House. The story for this movie was actually pretty decent. It was the dialogue that I had a problem with. The lines between the different characters was so bizarre, and so cryptic, you often found that you had lost track of the important moments because you were too busy trying to figure out what the hell they were trying to say to one another. One of my favorites was ""You gotta get me to the tall corn"". It sounded very Dora the Explorer-like."
1,Mamet is coasting,"on Glengarry Glen Ross...still!I endured this last night and will now try to spare you the experience.I had a bad feeling during the first few minutes. Then, about 10 minutes in, there is a scene where two Delta trainees are in a room together. Oh man, I could feel it coming, but I didn't want to believe it. Sure enough, the training sargent issues his instructions and steps back. Last man standing joins the unit.At times I laughed, but basically by the end of the movie I was sick to my stomach that I had paid $4 and two hours of my life watching this. Although when the wooden Kilmer leans over his female accomplice at the end and says, ""Oh baby"", I did have one last chuckle.No more Mamet for me."
1,I think the director and producer were on crack...,"I can honestly say this is the worst movie I've ever seen.The acting is stilted and disjointed to start. The diaglog is as banal as it gets, and most of the time it doesn't even make any sense. The scenes jump from one to another with no intelligible transitions.This could have been a good movie, but it seems like everything about it was based on chance with no planing whatsoever."
1,Just another stupid action flick.,"When I read about this movie I thought it would be a political thriler or something close to that. Boy, was I missguided. The screenplay sucks big time!!! It's just a stupid patriotic action movie where 10 people have to die just to save a slut who happens to be the U.S. Presidents daughter. C'mon Hollywood you can do better than that!!! And as a Val Kilmer fan I have to say "" What's wrong with you Val? You can't be so desperate!"""
1,Baaaaaad!,Get a lobotomy if you want to hope to enjoy this movie. It was so bad I wanted to yell at the screen. I rented this movie and so wish Amazon offered returns on online rentals/
3,"Worth the watch, don't think too much.","It is a great looking well made cross and double cross film that despite the obvious plot holes and some scenes that will make zero sense, is still fun to watch. David Mamet is always a solid director and while hardly one of his best films, it was fun. Solid cast."
5,Val Kilmer at his best,"It was great, pure and simple just great. Good triller, good surprises and great acting. The entire cast was wonderful."
4,Under-rated...,"Intriguing movie with as many layers as an onion. There is also a surprising, rare commentary by star Val Kilmer (one of the most under rated actors of the day) in which he alternately teases and admires with warmth, director David Mamet (""Dav-eed Mam-ay""), as well as the Black Ops/Rangers-types he plays in Spartan.Best to go into the film unspoiled and be surprised, several times over. For anyone who loves espionage with a twist, this one won't disappoint."
4,Talk,"Mamet, master of dialogue, manages a good action flick, filled with cameos. But a bad guy's laughable exposition with news crew nearby spoils a lean, tough thriller. I wish movies would hire bad guys we don't know, so we wouldn't keep looking for the well-known talented individual to pop up,invariably they do,up to no good."
2,Holy cow! It's so bad!!!,"The amazon review has it right in that it's somehow a watchable movie, but oh man oh man is it bad. Kilmer is typically awful. Ed O'Neil is Ed O'Neil. The dialogue and stage directions and everything about the script are like they came out of a student film... but not human students.... maybe gerbil students. Dumb gerbils."
2,Poor and Chaotic,This movie is poorly written. The plot is chaotic and meandering and greatly suffers from a lack of coherence and believability.Val Kilmer plays a Secret Service agent tasked to rescue a senator's daughter after she was abducted and sent to the Middle East to be sold into the sex trade. It turns out it is hard to tell the good guys from the bad guys and nefarious plots are afoot. But as the plot unfolds it is flat and really not well conceived.Thumbs down.
1,Oh Puleeze,"This is not worth your time. Trust me. The plot has merit, and the acting is good, but the storyline is a jumble of piecemeal segments that are quite tedious. I can't believe I watched the whole thing."
1,"Starts good, but lacks good plot and is political biased","This movie starts good, but oh what a bumer in the end. Just when you start to get currious about this movie, it turns more unrealistic every minute. The whole story just made no sence to me, why do the characters what they do, they seem to have so many more options that are much more likely. But what bothered me more is the kind of sick ideas that are the basis of the film. I think that we should always question state power, also the presidents power, but I can not happen to think that this plot idea has something todo with political inspirations that only Hollywood liberals have. Who else can tie the war on terror wich such a visious idea about the presidency, as is done in this movie."
2,LARRY,"AN INTERESTING START. LOUSY DISORGANIZED ENDING.ONCE YOU MEET THE KIDNAPPED GIRL , YOU THINK NO ONE WOULD BOTHER TO CONTINUE TO TRY AND SAVE HER. ONE OF THE MOST REPULSIVE IDIOTIC CHARACTERS EVER DEVELOPED ON FILM. LOUSY."
3,Very mixed review,"The story is interesting (if a bit implausible). The action is good. This is like a James Bond movie for adults (rather than teenagers). Orinally, I loved this movie and actually saw it three times in the theater (don't ask me why). I now have it on DVD, and I have one ""issue"" with it. It is WAY overwritten. Noone talks that way. And the actors basically proclaim their lines, like they are doing theater, instead of the lines naturally coming, out of the character and the situation. It is like you put someone at point X and he declames his lines. I couldn't believe how bad that is. Val Kilmer could have had his lines come from within, rather than proclaiming them in such a wooden way. I still would recommend this, but it is just odd, the way the dialog comes off in this movie. Still, good movie with a good plot and lots of interesting turns and twists. It just seemed way overengineered to me."
1,Mindless drivel,"This and Van Helsing are the worst movies I have seen in the past 5 years. The entire film was utterly painful to watch, and the dialogue seemed like it was written by a retarded monkey. I would sooner pay $8 to have the memory of this film erased from my mind. The only thing that kept me from drowning myself in the toilet after seeing that film was to write this review in hopes of deterring others from making the same mistake I did."
4,I have seen the sign,"The president's daughter is stolen and it requires all the US secret resources to find and bring her back before the people that did the abduction know who she is.Looks like it is too late so everything will be called off. No wait Curtis (Derek Luke) has seen the sign. What does this mean? A movie that was well done. Lots of action, good acting, and emotion.Yes this is a formula movie and the theme is older the hills. But that is why we watch these movies. We suspect who the good buys and bad guys are but never know until they turn on us.And is it my imagination or is Val Kilmer getting better?"
4,Mamet Comes Through Yet Again,"David Mamet is one of the most interesting screen writers out there. The dialouge in his films are always somewhat mechanical, yet poetic. If you've seen the brilliant Spanish Prisoner, then you should have an idea of what I'm talking about. Spartan delivers that same layered, hand-crafted dialouge again.The story is interesting, as are the characters. The president's daughter is missing, and so Kilmer, who is a sort of Rouge government agent, who does as he is told, no more or no less, is hired along with a partner who has a knack for questioning everything. A very Mamet-like plot then unfolds with all of the conspiracies that you'd expect from a Mamet film.I enjoyed this film immensly. The acting, while not excellent, is appropriate, and as I said before, the script is to be savored by all fans of conspiracy/mystery thriller films."
5,Enlightening Music,"While out shopping one day (in Japan), I happened into a very hip & modern looking shop with the most grooviest, exotic music I've heard in a long time, playing on their system. I had to have it...and now I use it all the time while teaching Yoga. My students are always asking about it...and since I bought the last one in the store here, I was really happy to see that Amazon is also selling it. I'm going to be sure and let everyone know where to get it now."
3,It is Just OK,I was really looking for a book to identify the birds at my feeders. This book is ok but I am not thrilled. I am going to look for another book that is simpler and more basic and where the bird pictures are a bid bigger with more visible detail. I will keep this book as I think I will grow into it. But I feel this i more a book for someone with a bit of experience.
5,The only field guide to birds you'll ever need.,"I'm an ornithologist, a bander, and a rehabilitator. This is the only book I ever use, period. It's pretty much ideal for identifying adults, though I do wish he had more pictures of juveniles and fledglings - but I hear he's coming out with a new book soon enough! :)"
4,Birds of Eastern North America,"Well, the book was as advertised. It has been helpful to my identifying a couple of sparrows in my vicinity. It has also spurred me into more photography of birds. Also, the book arrived in due time and was in the shape they said it would be."
4,Compared to Petersens,I've used the Petersen's Field Guide for many years but saw on reviews that some thought Sibley's was better. It is more convenient as habitat maps are on the same page. I think it also lists more sub-species.My one complaint is the drawings are not as large as Petersen's and the different distinctions and markings are not as emphasized as Petersen's. I keep the two books together and I'm not discarding my Petersen's.
5,great reference book for a novice,This is a great reference book if you're new to bird identification. Its very easy to use quickly to identify and packed with info for times you're looking for further information. And the price is great too.
5,"I mean, it's the Sibley Guide","This guide is transportable and handy. It fits easily in a coat pocket and can be navigated around binoculars, but still has enough information to identify a bird reliably. If nothing else, use this for reference in the field and keep the big guide at home. I have never had a problem with a Sibley guide, and this is a marvelous little product."
4,Bird-Watcher,Outstanding guide for quick reference in the field or at home. Enough info for the non-professional ornothalogist.
4,A good field guide for visual identification.,"This is a good field guide, and the drawings of different birds are nice. I especially like the fact that there are, very often, drawings of juvenile birds alongside the drawings of the adults, and there are usually drawings of both male and female adults. However, the listings for each type of bird are rather short and don't offer much detail. This book is good for visual identification of different birds, but I'll have to stick to other books if I want a more in-depth look at behavior, breeding and nesting habits, etc."
5,A VERY USEFUL GUIDE - HIGHLY RECOMMEND!,"This is one of those guides I finally got around to purchasing and am quite grateful I did...wish I had done it sooner! I own quite a large number of guides dating back well over fifty years when I first stated birding. I carry several (never just one) in the field and this latest addition to my collection is now always present. It is quite accurate, well organized and very easy to pack and use. I have found that younger people, for what ever reason, seem to like this work (they sort of roll their eyes when I keep draging out my old worn Peterson) and if it works for them and encourages them in this wonderful passion, then I am all for it. Recommend it highly."
5,Sibley's Best Field Guides,"Recently moved from California to the East. Sibley's guide for Western North America was the guide my mentor in birding used the most, so I knew when I arrived at my new home that getting this guide for Eastern birds was a priority. I was not disappointed. It is my only guide for this area, and I have no need for an alternative/backup guide. It is very user friendly for novice birdwatching identification, yet challenges me to go deeper with my general bird knowledge. Strongly recommended to all birdwatchers, from novices to the experienced."
4,SIBLEY BIRD BOOK,FIRST NEW BIRD BOOK IN 35 YEARS. I FIND THE BOOK VERY WELL ORGANIZED AND THE PICS ARE GREAT.
4,Good book for a good price,"The book is a very useful guide for who wants to do birdwatching, and who has a basic knowledge of birds. In the case you don't have a basic knowledge of birds but you are a good watcher, the guide is still helpful as it make a summary of some concepts."
4,Excellent.,The book is an excellent resource for amatuer bird watchers or Field Ecologists like myself. It's easy to read and follow and full of figures and drawings for identification of species of birds in my area. Good purchase for anyone who is interested in birds.
4,Bird Watching 101!!,"I belong to the Cornell Orinthology Bird Watching. I love to watch the birds from the 8-10 feeders in my yard. My girlfriend is also an avid bird watcher, and recommended this book to me. I have found it VERY resourceful in identifying birds and tidbits of information about them. I take this book with me when I travel, so I can identify birds in other parts of the U.S. The only downfall is the way some birds are listed in the index-you sometimes have to look under various names to find the type of bird you're looking for."
2,A useful field reference.,"This is a handy pocket-size to carry with you. It is designed to be handy in the field, thus the most important and quick ID pointers label the plates.Beyond that however there are flaws. I find the illustrations a bit unsubstantial. They are accurate in terms of structure, but to me lack depth or interest. Also the maps feature too many different colour codes to remember."
4,Great beginner field guide,"For my first field guides, I purchased this and the National Geographic. I was actually suppose to get the Western one but ordered the wrong one, but I digress. After comparing both books, I find the Sibley a great book for beginners. Although I am currently using the National Geographic one more, the simple yet detailed illustrations are helpful for novice birders. The descriptions are very helpful and the various illustrations of the different plumage for a certain species is helpful in identification. Overall, the illustrations seem to lack a bit of impact which kind of turns me off on using this book first before the National Geographic. However, I like to use both books to confirm any hard ID's and the Sibley is a wonderful guide to use. Definitely recommended but I would check out the National Geographic one as well!"
3,birds,"Not as intuitive as I would have liked. Hard to find the bird I am looking for. Was labeled Field Guide to Birds of Eastern North America, but it includes all of North American birds."
2,Cheap electronics,"The batteries provided can barely power the motor. The on/off switch is a 3 cycle mechanism with 2 buttons. On to get low power, off, on again for high power. Already the electronics inside are 'loose' and you need to tap the handle to get the motor to run. I've had the item for about 4 hours."
1,bad purchase,"Great idea but needs R&D because the batteries only last one or 2 days, which is rediculous and not worth the aggravation. I don't even use it..a total waste of money."
1,Hated It,I got the Spin Spa a few years ago. You can't get enough pressure for the brush to do any good. I wasted a lot of money on this and it hung in my batheroom and gathered dust. I used the suction hook for a better hand held brush.
3,Good for the money!,I have been using the brush every day for almost 4 weeks now and I have to say that I never had a problem so far and it still works on the same rechargable batteries without having to charge them again. It helps exfoliate and feels good in the morning to massage your back with. We will see how long it lasts.
2,Spin Spa,"When I received these items I had to fix them to work. The spring where the batteries go was bent on both products. It took me a bit to get a screwdriver and try to bend the springs so they made contact. I almost sent them back! My review, I give it a 2."
3,not as powerful as i'd like,The spa brush is very nice and a handy accessory. but. the brush is not strong at all. after applying a bit of pressure on skin in the shower the brush head doesn't spin. it tries to but isn't powerful enough to scrub the way i'd like.
3,Spin Spa just a little let down,"It's O.K. except that when I put pressure on the brush, it stops spinning. The soap dispenser will not dispense, unless I add water as well."
1,Don't waste your money,"At first I really like it, even tho it was underpowered. Then I changed the batteries. And it stopped working. Then I sent it back. I am disappointed, because I too believe this has the potential to be a great product. Just needs more engineering by someone who is interested in more than just ripping off the public."
1,Garbage.,"If you waste your money on this product, you will have no one to blame but yourself. The concept is desirable; that's the only thing this item hits on. It sucks the life out of your batteries and for the FIVE MINUTES precious new batteries will put into it, it won't survive pressure you need to use to get the thing to spin. You will be disappointed. I promise."
1,Good concept but weak power,"This product was wonderful for the first run. Good concept for the price. However, it run out of juice after one run with brand new batteries and even with brand new rechargeable batteries. Having the replaced batteries almost each use is too much.If they make it where batteries last a little longer, I would be gladly to pay more than $15 for this product."
2,Needs More Power,"I bought this product once it was available at department stores. I was quite excited to try it out. It's very easy to work with, but lacks power. If you turn the product on without an attachment, you can immediately notice that there is more power in the gears than with an attachment. This in itself is mildly disappointing. When you use it in the shower, you cannot apply pressure to the Spin Spa because it will stop spinning. In my opinion, it feels like you get an insufficient result simply due to the lack of torque in the brush."
1,Not worth the Box it comes in,"I bought this product expecting it to last a couple years, at least. While it worked it was almost worthless at best. The slightest amount of pressure would slow the spin head down to a stop, even with brand new batteries. About the 3rd week, it slipped out of my hand ( water, soap.... no non-slip handle) and fell to the tile floor. It LOOKED ok but I could hear something rattling inside, and it never spun its little head again. It's junk, in my opinion."
3,"If not for breaking all the time, it would be a 5 star review","I've bought about three of these things (10 bucks every 6 months is not a bad thing.. I think) because there is nothing else out there like it. Bed, Bath and Beyond used to carry it. I'm on my fourth purchase of it.Yes it breaks ALL THE TIME> One time it was because I accidentally dropped it in the shower. The wires inside are so bad that it stopped working.The second time, it just lost power. I think something happened with the battery connections.The third time, just stopped working one day.But this has been going on for two years so the investment of 10 bucks is no big deal for me.For 10 bucks, it isn't going to last a life time.I think I'm going to try to fix the one I've got, learn a little electronics. But in the meantime, I miss my spinny spa.Off to buy another : )~meegan"
1,The Spinning Spa Brush,This is a very poorly made product. When used with any kind of pressure the attachment comes flying off. I actually returned the item.
2,Power,This has little or no power so it does not spin well nor does it do the job. I would pass on this product.
1,horrible waste of money,"i got this for my wife as a present.. i paid about 25 bucks. PEOPLE SAVE YOUR SELF THE MONEY AND EMBARRASMENT. do not buy this for your self or anyone else. first of all it wasnt powerfull at all we changed the bateries and it stayed the same, yeah it spins fast but once you press against your sking a tooth brush would do a better job. as well after sitting in the shower for a while it got all moldy."
3,AS seen on tv,"yea those things are always cheap. it doesnt have much pressure, but still it made a cute christmas present for my mom. it works, it just has that ""cheap ready to break"" feeeling that you get wwith alll ""as seen on tv"" items."
2,Performance dissapointing,"I thought that this product would have more power than it actually has. When a moderate amount of pressure is applied, the product's spinning power declines quite a bit and does not perform as antisipated. If someone were to ask me about purchasing this product, I would tell them that I would not as I felt that it is not worth it."
1,JUNK!,"Do not waste your money on this worthless piece of junk, the attachments stink and the motor is not as it looks on the infomercial, needless to say it stopped working, I wish I would have saved my money on this battery guzzling piece of junk! Do Not Buy! Not worth your time money or effort! Ugh! Amazon should not be selling this type of garbage!"
5,A GREAT COMPILATION,From the gentle beginning of How Come to the last note of the cover of the Stones' Sweet Virginia this is a compilation that doesn't let down the listner. The acoustic ballad with a strong english folk influence predominates and Lane's talent for inspiring melody is revealed on most tracks. The collected solo singles of the main creative talent behind the Faces and Small Faces is definitely worth having.
4,Wide eyed,"My sister and me realy LOVE this cd. Oh, wow. I'm a poet and i didn't even realize it. anyways, back to Nicole Nordeman. my sister likes 'River God' and 'Wide Eyed' best, but i like 'Is it any wonder' and 'To say thanks'. it is a realy cool cd!! and you will realy love to get it. im serious, you will!!!"
5,BEST THING I'VE HEARD IN A LONG TIME,THIS ALBUM IS SO INTIMATE AND HAS WON ME OVER. I CAN'T PUT IT DOWN. KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK.
4,Great CCM Album By A Wonderfully Talented New Artist,"I was surprisingly impressed with this CD. I was captured by the title tune to the CD, ""Wide Eyed"" so I decided to buy the CD; I was not dissapointed. Ms. Nordeman is an excellent songwriter and a great singer. This CD is very refreshing. Some other great cuts on it include ""Burnin'"", ""Is It Any Wonder"" and ""To Know You"". I hope to hear more from this great young, inspiring artist."
5,Moving,Nichole elegantly writes of the struggle and doubts which come and go in following God and faith. She also sings about God's love in a unique way. The songs are haunting and moving and beautiful. I heard her sing in a small venue in Baton Rouge in October of 1998 and was completely entranced. I purchased my CD there and have been listening to it ever since.
5,ONE OF THE BEST CHRISTIAN MUSIC ARTIEST EVER!,"I bought this album on a whim. I never heard of Nichole Nordeman,until I bought it. Now I listen to it all the TIME! My favorite song are ""Wide Eyed."" All the songs on this album are great though."
5,One SERIOUS Wheelbarrow!!,"Moving heavy loads of sand, dirt, concrete, or bricks was always a painful chore with my lightweight single wheel barrow. But this double-wheel beauty makes those jobs so much easier. No tilting, loss-of-control dumped loads anymore. Heavy duty construction, and it was very easy to assemble. If you really need a heavy duty wheelbarrow, you can't go wrong with this one."
5,This sucker lasts a lifetime!,"In the past I have used Jackson and Truetemper, now that I found Brentwood Wheelbarrows I will never try another brand ever! The thickness of the pan is so much heavier than what you see on the market these days. Also, if you compare the steel to what's on the market there is no competition at all. Basically, the old saying ""You get what you pay for"" speaks for itself. I paid a little more but this lasts forever!Thanks Brentwood!"
5,New style for a wheelbarrow,The product itself is amazing. Directions for assembly need help (difficult to follow the drawings as to what to put where) and Amazon shipped the wrong top part. Toll-free Company support helped get things assembled correctly without returning item. I found I could actually push heavier loads over rough terrain since use of two wheels spread out the load weight. Not very good for small areas and for turning quickly.
3,Yard and Garden Helpmate,"Our new Brentwood heavy duty two wheel barrow is just what we needed as a helping hand in our yard and garden. The 6 cubic foot capicity holds much more then the two of us could carry at one time from one area to another. The two wheels help to balance the load and makes it easy for either of us to use it. Even though I have a handicap, I am able to use it for lighter loads of cuttings. It helps me to feel more useful in our garden and yard area. I love to work outside and this wheel barrow helps me carry my tools and garden stool to my work area without making many trips. We passed our smaller metal one wheel barrow on to someone else."
3,Heavy duty Wheelbarrow,"This wheelbarrow is not going to come apart after a few uses. The double wheels enable you to carry heavier loads, but makes it much more difficult to maneuver."
2,Two wheel barrow,"This item is VERY awkward to use. It is heavy, does NOT STEER well and has been a great disapointment!!!!!"
1,DON'T BUY THIS!!!!!,"Instead, buy Cheap Thrills. If you are looking at this and thinking that this ""Best Of"" CD would be good to buy because you want to get into Zappa, DON'T! Cheap Thrills is a much better representation of Zappa's catalogue. It includes many of his classics such as Joe's Garage and Catholic Girls and some live stuff and is generally a much better compilation than this. Also, if you end up not liking Zappa (which I doubt will happen) Cheap Thrills is (as the name says) cheap. Amazon has it for like 7 bucks and I got it at a music store for around 3 bucks. So, in conclusion, DON'T BUY THIS!! Buy Cheap Thrills, and if you like it, buy Son of Cheap Thrills, and if you still like it then go to the You Can't Do That On Stage Anymore series and so on..."
5,"""Strictly FROM Commercial"" is the expression...","...and the lyric. How lame to NOT get the expression right. Who edited this? Someone totally cluess, apparently."
4,SOME of his best.,"Ok I admit, this is a pretty decent and lengthy collection, and it's the more accessible side of Frank Zappa. I won't even attempt to say what's missing. Instead I'll point out the great inclusions like ""Dancin' Fool"", the social commentary of ""Trouble Every Day"", the hysterical ""Valley Girl"", the dreams of ""Montana"", and ""Cosmik Debris"". ""Joe's Garage"" is edited, but at least it's here. Every track here is at least good or interesting, even if it's also weird and wacky. ""Strictly Commercial"" is an obvious choice for your first or only Frank Zappa disc, as is the point."
5,Start here!,"This is not a comprehensive collection, but it is a great place to start if you are new to Zappa. This was my first Zappa album and some 35 albums later I still crave more."
2,I Don't Get It,"Take some stale puns and rehashed jokes that wouldn't have made the cut on Saturday Night Live, a guitarist who thinks playing fast is playing well, a second-rate band that can't decide if it's rock or jazz, and you've got Frank Zappa. He was a trailblazer for freedom of speech and I admire him for that. But if you want funny, try Loudon Wainwright."
1,A good reason to know not to pursue any futher Frank Zappa,"This disk had one or two good tracks (""Sexual Harrassment in the Workplace""), but most of it was just musically uninteresting-- and this is the evaluation of a person that listens to and enjoys just about all forms of music.If this is the most commercially successful material that he could produce, this CD is a good warning to avoid Frank Zappa.Not worth more than $5."
3,The Best?,"This is not the Best of Frank Zappa. It is designed to attract new consumers, with songs close to the 3 min format that could have been played on the radio. His greatest hit 'Boby brown goes down' is not even included due to his obscene language.These are mostly 'rock songs', which are only the tip of the iceberg of Zappa's work. My recommendation: skip this album and get the Apostrophe or Overnite sensations albums, which will be familiar to any rock fan. Even the Cheap thrills compilation is a better place to start (and cheaper)."
5,Don't eat the yellow snow,Pure genius. This is my first Zappa cd I got and it will not be my last. It also has a little article by Terry Gilliam (one of the greatest directors ever) and gives you a history of each song and what album to look for them on. I'm already eyeing all the original albums in CD stores. The first song is great and I can never stop listening to it. I suggest anyone that loves and lives music should buy this cd.
4,"Meant as an introduction, but that's almost impossible","I was overwhelmed by the vast amount of output that this musical genius has produced and was looking for an album that summarized his most accessible songs. In that sense, this album does a fine job, but in time I realize that his less accessible music is actually a lot more interesting to hear. The point is that once you discover that, there's no end to what you can buy from him - and it can't be summarized on one disc. Zappa is the artist that you either hate or love - meaning that you own nothing or everything. There's really nothing inbetween and in that sense, the added value of this album may be questioned."
2,So funny I forgot to laugh,"I gather from the other reviews here (and elsewhere) that this is supposed to be a well-chosen compilation and a good introduction to Zappa. Well, if this is the best he could do, I certainly don't need to hear any more.This is nothing more than Weird Al Yankovic with better instrumentation. And it's not funny. It's puerile. Sure Frank's a good enough guitar player, but his solos are not worth having to sit through all of this unlistenable garbage. Sorry, I tried to get it, but I just don't."
4,"Decent compilation, but his ""best""? Nah.","The music on this disc is the closest to the mainstream that Frank got. It's good stuff, but he was at his best when live. Check out the ""You can't do that on stage anymore"" series from Ryko. I suppose if you want to get a cross section of his music this will suffice, but I can't say it's really representative of his larger work."
1,Good idea but falls way short,"Zappa (like the Grateful Dead) requires more than a compilation of short snipets to get the real picture. Instead of this, start out with Apostrophe or One Size Fits All. Then move on to the really GOOD stuff: Roxy and Elsewhere, Fillmore or the You Can't Do That collection. Like the Dead, its the live stuff that will get ya."
2,Misleading.,"""Strictly Commercial"". The title says it all. Zappa was incredible, but this collection does not reveal to the new listener what Frank was capable of. None of these songs are bad, but most of them are just novelty songs (""Be in my video"", ""valley girl"", ""disco boy"", etc. ) that get old FAST. Peaches en regalia is wonderful, but rather than buy this collection you should get ""Hot Rats"", the album which it originally appeared on. I saw that at least one reviewer on this list was turned off by Strictly Commercial, and that's really a shame. If only that individual had bought a different Zappa album first I suspect he might have had a more positive response. I think curious new listeners should avoid this and try ""One Size Fits All"" as a first step into Zappa's world. Or maybe ""Lather"", or ""Chunga's Revenge"", or ""Absolutely Free"", or ""Shut up n play your guitar"", or..."
1,Lacks conceptual continuity,"Admittedly I don't like ""greatest hits"" albums; this one is especially odious. Strictly Commercial, produced after Zappa's death, collects nineteen songs from sixteen albums (Hot Rats, Apostrophe, Over-nite Sensation, We're Only In It For the Money, Sheik Yerbouti, One Size Fits All, Joe's Garage, Them or Us, Weasels Ripped My Flesh, Freak Out!, Zoot Allures, Guitar, Tinsel Town Rebellion, Chunga's Revenge, Ship Arriving Too Late to Save a Drowning Witch, and Bongo Fury) and three singles. Each single is inferior to its album version. As far as I am familiar with the source albums (owning and liking twelve of the sixteen), each original album is more enjoyable than this item. I cannot recommend Strictly Commercial over any of Zappa's original works."
2,Take the title literally.,"I'm new to Zappa - but I would say this is a disappointing compilation, particularly having since heard Steve Vai's excellent compilation of FZ Original Recordings. Check it out instead: it actually gets to the bottom line of the artist. This compilation doesn't, and is another example of how bland compilation albums created by the music publisher typically are."
3,For the casual fan.,"Strictly Commercial is for anyone who is curious about Frank Zappa and wants a mild intro into his rather eclectic world. I am not a huge admirer of his music(Though I am a big fan of his First Amendment stand)and found this to be a mostly humorous compilation of oddities like ""Don't Eat That Yellow Snow"" and ""Valley Girl."" If it takes you into a Zappa fandom it served its purpose. For me it's more like a Dr. Demento collection. Fun, but with no real staying power."
2,take my name away!,"someone gave me this album and I've only been able to hear it all a little at a time. I never listen to it now. Zappa could shred on guitar, he played with other competent musicians, so why do I dislike Zappa's music? It's a question of taste. I dislike his STYLE. I don't find it clever or funny - just stupid. And very, very SELF-INDULGENT. Have you ever seen ""200 Motels?"" That has to be the most self-indulgent dung heap ever committed to celluloid. I guess I like Zappa best when he's just playing as on HOT RATS, but even his instrumentals seem to scream, ""look how clever I am!""Zappa himself was actually a very cool dude and I would recommend to anyone ""The Real Frank Zappa Book."" I have heard some of his other albums, and believe me, I love experimentalism (Faust, Mr. Bungle, etc.) but I can't get behind someone recording idle conversation into a covered grand piano as if it was an ingeniously clever thing to do. Uh, no. No, thanks."
2,Not my cup of tea.,"If you like Rock/Folk from late 60's thru 70's, maybe this might click with you. I do like genre of music, BUT not FZ."
4,Strictly Commercial: The Best of Frank Zappa,Strictly Commercial: The Best of Frank Zappa is a compilation album by Zappa and was released 2 years after his death to great reviews by the critics. Allmusic gave it 4 1/2 stars and since I can not give half stars on amazon I therefore give it 4 stars. Zappa is a one of a kind of an artist and a rebel like Iggy Pop and Willy Deville. 4/5.
3,For the Statistically Savvy Only,"I am now using this textbook for a graduate statistics course. I personally do not find it to be the most accessible book for those who are not already highly schooled in statistics, linear algebra, and calculus. There is an attempt at the back of the book to introduce you to the only linear algebra and calculus you ""need"" to understand the book. But I think the book continues to go far beyond what is accessible to someone being introduced to this information for the first time.I think the book is probably excellent if you are already familiar with regression, calculus, and linear algebra. However, for those who are not, I would recommend Paul Allison's ""Multiple Regression: A Primer"" to get OLS and Pampel's ""Logistic Regression: A Primer"" to get Logistic. These books introduce you to the same concepts but without all the extra stuff that most people won't use anyway."
3,Useful but disorganized,"This book is a useful first book in linear regression. Fox covers the basics effectively, and the book nicely complements Fox's guide to Regression in R and S Plus.My biggest problem with the book is Fox's meandering prose style. Few of his paragraphs start with topic sentences, and the formatting of the text means it's almost impossible to figure out what the take-away points are. (It would have been nice for Fox to reverse-engineer his chapters from the end-of-chapter summaries, which are the most helpful guide to his book, and actually happen to be organized.For a more organized and more clearly written guide to regression, see Basic Econometrics by Gujarati."
1,Not suitable as an introduction to regression analysis,"While this book is no doubt useful to students with a solid background in math and statistics, I certainly would NOT recommend it as an introduction to regression analysis. The explanations tend to be far too complex and inaccessible for most graduate students in the social sciences. Put it this way: after having spent almost $100 on this book, I've had more success finding useful explanations of some of the book's topics on Google than I have had by reading the book itself."
2,Needs better description,"Nice quality and color matches my other kohler fixtures, but no where does it inlude or say what it works with. After purchasing this, i had to return it because it does not work with the ez connect garbage disposal system and is intended primarily for the insinkerator or three prong system."
3,didn't need it for installation of the new garbage disposal,"It was ""hinted"" that if I bought the Waste King Garbage Disposal that ""people who bought the disposal also bought this item"". It was not needed, as the garbage disposal came with everything it needed."
2,Finish chipped off already =(,"Being that this is made by Kohler, I thought the finish would have lasted a lifetime. Here it is 2 months later, and it's already chipped on me. Kind of frustrating.Otherwise, works as expected and it's very nice looking. Just make sure to not hit it with anything."
1,Watch out,"You don't need this item at all for your waste king 1hp, they said is better but you don't need it, besides you will need an extended sink flange . That is not included in your waste king disposer. So in my case I only threw my good dllrs. away."
2,Sony MD-Case4 Minidisc Walkman Armband Carry Case,"Overall, case looks good but as soon I placed my minidisc into the unit, I noticed that the fit was wrong. The dimensions on the case was uneven, I believed it was a result of a manufacturing and quality assurance error. Also the Velcro sawing was undone on one side. I'm not completely satisfied with this item but for the amount of use it was intended and considering MD's are obsolete it will have to do."
3,does not fit the Sont Walkman S545,"I bought this for the Sony Walkman S545 16GB mp3 player.... does not fit that product, my fault for not reading more into it."
1,A complete waste of money and materials,"This product just wasn't very well-designed from the get-go. It's hardly big enough to fit my slimline Hi-MD player into, and it's also supposed to have enough room left over to fit an additional minidisc inside. Good luck with that. There's not really anywhere on it to clip on the remote stick except a little plastic loop that doesn't really do the job. The velcro armband isn't particularly effective unless you tighten it SO much as to literally cut off the circulation in your arm, otherwise it just slides down your arm until it gets to your wrist. I tried to use it for about two weeks and decided it was just easier to put my discman in my front pants pocket. I'm sorry I wasted the money on this thing. Oh, and could they have picked an uglier color for it? I don't think so."
3,Band not to elastic,"First I had a little trouble because the company sent the wrong case, but they were really good about sending me the correct item and including a prepaid envelope to send the incorrect item back. I purchased the case to allow me to workout, but the strap for holding the player on the arm is Velcro and non-elastic. This does not allow for arm motion when performing curls or rows. I realize that the player is kind of bulky to have strapped to the arm which is not the cases fault. The construction is good and if all you are doing is cardio this case works well. Other wise just keep the player in your pocket and save your money."
4,"""better than keeping the MD player in your pocket""","This case worked out great, get the music going and forget that its even on your arm, good travel case as well. G"
3,not the best design!,"well I purchased this case 4 my Hi-MD NH-600D, which this case states on the side of the box that it will fit this model player. well let me be the first. to say that it doesn't fit this model at all. In fact, it doesn't even come close to fitting the NH-600D minidisc at all. Luckily, I was able to find the older Mdcase3 on Ebay and that case fits all of my minidisc perfectly."
5,these are better than pampered chef,"I love these! they work they are dishwasher safe, and the handles are heavier than plastic, being metal, so they wont get tossed around in the dishwasher and land on the heating coil... My pampered chef spatulas were destroyed, every one of them, that way. They are less expensive, and better. I recommend them."
2,Good for Crap from China but aint great...,Sometimes crap from china is better than other times. This time junk from china is pretty good. This one is pretty good but way overpriced. Wait till you can get this junk again for less than 10 dollars cause it ain't worth all that much. Then again what kitchen gear is not made by communist woman torturers?
3,Sooo many rubber spatulas,"Nice quality, but let's be honest. Who the heck needs that many rubber spatulas. I use them maybe once a week, so that doesn't justify me having 8 of them. No complaints about the product itself though..."
4,These are the only spatulas I use now,"These are the best, easy to clean, and great for scraping out every last bit of food. I love the later part as I hate wasting food. My only complain is that these may not be as durable. One of them broke after few months of use, and I tried to contact the amazon service to provide me the details of manufacturer. I did not get any response by email or phone."
5,A Spatula for almost every need; look great too!,"This set of eight differently sized and shaped spatulas provides one for (nearly) every need. (The only one that seems missing is a long, narrow one.) They are a cheerful, bright red. They hold up well through multiple trips though the dishwasher; I have waited to write this review until I could see how they did with heavy use and washing, and they have done wonderfully.Because it doesn't fit with my decor, I haven't used the stainless canister holder, but it is clearly a quality-looking item and would likely fit into most kitchens very nicely. I have felt that the spatulas were so handy, as well as attractive in my own Portmeirion canisters, that the cost was well worth it."
5,These last for years,"I received this set as a gift in February 2008. It is now May 2010 and I still love these spatulas! They have survived the dishwasher, many hot pots, a big move, and still work like a charm. The variety of sizes is great, and the durability and versatility of this set can't be beat."
3,My wife loves em! 'nuff said.,"This is a very high quality cannister and very high quality spatulas. I'm having a little trouble keeping up with the pastries, not to mention keeping my weight down since I bought them for her.If she loves them; I love them.Update: 1 year later. One of the spatuals broke off at the handle. No guarantee or replacement. Guess I'll stick with the $2.00 wooden handled ones. The cheapie I have has been with us for over 10 years and still going strong."
5,Really nice set,"I bought this for my daughter who is moving ""off campus"" and needs to set up a kitchen for the first time. When it came, I ""claimed"" a few of the spatulas (as it comes with a gazillion of them)and have used them almost every day since. Really nice long comfy handles."
2,Too soft for my use,"I put this on my wish list and got it as a birthday gift. I just loved the way it looked and it had such great reviews. Unfortunately, I personally don't like them very much after trying them out for 6 months. I find that the silicone pads are too soft and wobbly so I don't have much control.I do like the spoonula as that is a bit sturdier. I have 2 oxo spatulas and I find that I reach for them instead whenever I need a silicon spatula. I like the varying sizes but who needs so many of them!I'm glad they work well for others but I'm not a fan."
4,Great Value!,"Well made, quality materials and construction, and excellent attention paid to fit, finish, and design. Great value for the low price! Set could have included some more variety, like the odd-jar sizes that can be hard to reach, but for the costs, it's plenty useful! The Stainless Canister is nice and heavy enough to stuff with a few other goodies, and no worries about it falling over. It's not thin junk, this is very nice, and I'm impressed for the low price!Buy it, you'll be happy, and it's very capable to do what you need."
5,WOW! These are GREAT!,My husband can't quit raving about this set. I also think it is by far better to use than spoons to cook with. Even use them to cook scrambbled eggs. Throw in the dish washer afterwards...buy this set..you won't regret it.
5,Good! But metal handles clang & clank on glass jars.,"UPDATE: When left submerged in water, water seeps into the hollow handles. Later, when up-ended, the water drains into the canister holder -- leaving rust stains (from stainless steel!). I still like 'em; I am just a little more careful (and have inserted a folded paper towel in bottom of canister to catch any drip I missed). Tue, 24 June 2008.I use them. I like them. They clean up easily and in a foolproof manner -- never have to rewash any of them because some food is still caked on somewhere.I frequently use them to clean out large jars which do not have particularly wide mouths and I have to remember not to be too vigorous as the metal handle will bang & clang with the rim of the jars.Would buy again, if needed, or give as gift."
2,Poor Value,"I do not know whay Toshiba would want to make such a small set.It just does not make sense.To enjoy real DVD,you need at least a 19-inch TV.It just does not make any sense."
5,Good Product - Good Company,"Tired of spending $$$ bucks for kids sunglasses that are likely to get lost in a couple of months? Product is sturdy, UV rated and designed for kids. Company did a great job delivering as promised!"
4,COPPER IS NOT BROWN,"THE ILITE PRODUCTS ARE GREAT. THE ONLY REASON I HAVEN'T GIVEN THIS 5 STARS IS THE COLOR. WHEN PURCHASING, THE PICTURE LOOKS BROWN - WHICH IS WHAT I WAS LOOKING FOR. I HAVE KEPT THIS BECAUSE I DIDN'T WANT TO PAY SHIPPING TO SEND IT BACK, BUT I'M NOT HAVING AN EASY TIME FINDING OTHER PIECES TO MATCH AT A REASONABLE PRICE. THE PICTURE SHOULD BE CHANGED AS TO NOT MISLEAD ANY OTHER CUSTOMER."
5,Very Sharp Picture and Playback,"This is one of the better combination TV-VCRs I have seen. Panasonic and Sony also both make good 9-inch TVs. Toshiba's combination TV-VCRs often gets overlooked. However, this is an excellent set and performs equally well. The picture is crisp and sharp. The built-in Digital tracking 2 head VCR makes VHS tapes look very good. You get front A/V (RCA type) inputs with a TV/game switch. The VCR has good high-speed fast-forward and rewind performance. It also has time-shift recording capability and a built-in head cleaner. The front panel features a useful headphone jack. The 'Black' cabinet design is uniquely handsome and looks better than other competitor models."
3,Young's done better,"I have to admit that I had wanted Chris Young's score for Nightmare 2 for a long time. I'm a fan of the composer and some of his work I consider among the best of film scores. Unfortunately, it did not live up to my expectations. I don't really think the use of whale song is inspired or creepy. It's just kind of intrusive since I recognize it for what it is. There is some really good string writing though, so it's not a total loss. The same can't be said for Charles Bernstein's music for the original. Other than the opening track, I find his score annoying and terribly dated. I can only recommend this CD for die-hard Chris Young fans."
2,A GREAT SOUNDTRACK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I really love this soundtrack because it has all the songs from both nightmare 1 and 2.But i have to say the best songs are from nightmare 1 because its more scarier.Overall,i would say this soundtrack is fantastic!"
2,Don't waste your money on this DVD,"Don't waste your hard earned money on this DVD Set. I bought this set because of the price but now I regret it. This is a bunch of boring documentaries put together, featuring a bunch of unknown and not very credible researchers telling us why they think UFOs and Alien Abductions are real. I agree that there's a lot of informations on this documentary, but a lot of the cases are not very credible so what's the point ?? This is a proof that quality is a lot more important than quantity. I am disappointed because usually Mill Creek Entertainment produce good documentaries ( ""America's 60 greatest Unsolved Mysteries and Crimes"", ""Vegas: The city the Mob made"", America's Serial Killers: Portraits in Evil"" ).Don't waste your money on this DVD. If you want to buy real documentaries about UFOs then buy ""I know what I saw"", ""UFOs: The Best Evidences"" or ""Unsolved Mysteries: UFOs""."
1,Deceptive cover and title,"I agree with reviewer mistbornblue and others: This is a very poor documentary DVD. Its audio is almost inaudible most of the time, the images are made of very old --mostly blurred-- photos and the reading of some of the documents are unreadable, too small and blurred. I do not recommend anyone on spending a cent on this DVD. It is made out of interviews or conferences which have no relevant information at all. If you want to see good DVD's, related to the UFO, abductions, ET phenomena, etc, among others,you can see: UFO The Greatest Story Ever Denied, I Know What I Saw, The Day Before Disclosure. There are other very good ones. This one is not worth your money or your time."
4,Lots of information,"This DVD has a lot of useful information, but it is not an ""entertainment"" movie, so don't bother with this if your only mildly interested in UFOs. My only beef with this DVD is the use of CGI and graphics that have little to do with the topic. When I see a picture, I'd like to know it is real and not just a CGI image created by the production company. That said, this is a good purchase for serious viewers."
3,Decent movie.....,Its decent! and its a good deal for 6 documenturies. but on the other hand all of them r kinda corny if u ask me... the best 1 out of all of them is the second movie on the first disc...
2,Basement tapes,Cheap. Cost and quality about the same. Nice picture on the DVD case. Quality looks like someone pressed multiple copies off the original. I got the one that must have been pressed last.For the price O.K. but I woudn't spend any more.
5,Aliens,"This was a gift & they are very pleased with it. I like it also. Very informative, in my opinion."
2,Great at first but very disapointing at last,"This isn't really what people say it is.It's like I was reading ""accident"" all over again but with a diferent family.Life hurts and death more.Recovery from death is hard.Widows don't recover so fast and life isn't so easy when the one you love isn't returning.She tries to give Hope but theres something missing in this novel.Not good at all."
3,Easy Read,"I agree with some of the other reviewers that although this was a quick and enjoyable read, it lacks the depth of her earlier works. I used to enjoy waiting for the newest of her works however in the last few years, her newest book is out before I have finished the last one."
1,"Blah, Blah, Blah","This was the worst book I have ever read. It is the first time in 28 years that I have ever not finished a book. The main character is made out to be so strong through adversity, yet she is heartbroken by a man who is down-right evil to her. The only way this book gets 5 stars is if at the end (which I never read) she tells the good doctor to get lost! But somehow I doubt that happened."
2,Disappointing,"I read this book in less than a day, and once again was disappointed by one of Ms. Steel's most recent books. It was highly predictable and had very little character development. You never really get a great insight as to her husband, and the 3 daughters are just kind of there, compared to Jaime and Peter. I never got the impression that Jaime was handicap as the author wrote him to be. Overall, I am disppointed in the fact that for her last few books, they have seemed to have been hastily written, way too predictable, and have a regurgitated story line. Even the names in this book were ones used in other pretty recent books. I've been reading Danielle Steel for years, and sadly instead of getting better, her books have gotten profoundly worse. If you want to read a good Steel book, read Message From Nam, Fine Things, or Daddy. Don't bother with this one."
3,"It was a good one, but definitely not her best","Compared to Steel's other books, this one doesn't really measure up. It grabbed me at the beginning, but about halfway through it just seemed so repetitive that it was almost boring, and I usually love any of her books. I enjoyed reading it for the most part, but she has written much better. I think the problem was it was just too predictable and a typical plot that caused it to lack in the suspense that usually makes me enjoy reading Danielle Steel's novels."
2,Lacking,"I don't like reading a book, and finding myself looking back to clarify details. I found some details in this book that did not agree with each other in latter chapters. I feel that Ms. Steele writes too fast now, and the stories race to an end."
3,"good at first, but dissapointing at the end","I bought this book to read on a flight home, so when i started reading it, I loved it and then i couldnt put it down. But then eventually the book just got really boring, when she met the doctor, and how everything was just repeaded, and the same problems over and over, and i really didnt like the ending, it didnt give me much to look forward to if she was to make a sequel to this book..this book was so so its good to read when your bored. But save your dollars for star and mixed blessings."
4,When life gives you lemons......,"This book will not go down in history as great literature, but it is certainly an enjoyable, emotional, engrossing experience. Since life can turn any of us upside down at any moment, it is easy to relate to how it would feel to lose one's stability and life partner. Some characters were developed better than others. For instance, I never got any sense of the girls as individuals although the boys are very real. However, I think the author wanted there to be five children to give a sense how overwhelming it would be to parent them alone. As usual with this author, money was no problem which would not be the case in most families, but it did allow a little more time to focus on the relationships. Great book for a vacation, a rainy day, or a day at the beach--any time you want to be carried away and not forced to think too hard."
4,Hope prevails,"The House on Hope Street is a fitting title for this book on hope, love and a family determined to weather the storm after a terrible tragedy tears their father and husband from them. Danielle Steel creates warm characters that you feel for, though it took her until almost the end to make a new romance for Liz, but the book is, as usual, par for Steel and perfectly enjoyable."
2,Same Author = Same Story ??,"I guess I'm lucky to have started reading DS very recently. If I have read her earlier books, (like the ones recommended here, the good ones) I would have been even more disappointed. After my first book, Granny Dan, I wanted to try DS again, expecting something different but something that would show it's the same author. Ho ho ho !! Yeah, the same author all right, but the same story?? OK, it's not exactly the same, but close to what I read before. I'm scared to buy another book of hers because I'll get the feeling I've wasted money. Anyway I'll try 'The Ring' someday when I recover from the fear of spending money on the same story."
3,slow down,"i like ms steele but she is getting boring. it used to be i could not put her books down , after the klone and i , i got to the point it was all about the money not the talent . i still read the books in hope that she will come back . hope street was sad but same ole same ole. have you notice every woman is beautiful? let there be just a plain ole woman once or twice."
2,"Sorry, I am still waiting for Thurston House II","As always, I snatch up the latest DS novel, read it over a weekend, and say - I MISS THE OLD DANIELLE STEEL! Where is the history, the geography trips, something to learn while we are being romanced. The formula is tried and true - as one who has never missed one will attest - but I want more.. I am happy to see ""normal"" woman (not stunners with long flowing manes) who work and manage families - and not perfect familes either - good characters there - and I am happy that the would-be new love was not a clone, but guess I want it all. Overall, a fair summer beach/rainy day book."
4,Heartwarming,This book touches the soul! It reaches out to you. You actually feel you are right there with them! You become a part of their family. Danielle Steel has won my heart with this one!
3,Very predictable and Repititious,"House on Hope Street was the first Danielle Steel book I have ever read and probably the last. As I was standing in the book store trying to choose which one to buy, I quickly discovered that all of her books followed very similar story lines.Man and woman are deeply in love, man dies, and she is left trying to pick up the peices. While, I did enjoy this book, I will not read another Danielle Steel book. I don't really like her syle."
4,"Much Better than ""The Wedding!""","""The House on Hope street"" was soooo much more entertaining than ""The Wedding."" DS found her true niche in this story. Liz and Jack have the perfect business, perfect marriage and great kids until a Christmas tragedy changes everything. Liz copes by throwing herself into her work and kids. Until a second tragedy hits. Liz is almost at the end of her rope until Dr. Bill Webster helps her cope. Life isn't easy for the two, but they somehow weather the storm and all works out for the best."
1,The House on Hope Street by Danielle Steel,"I was very disappointed in this book. It seemed that Danielle Steel didn't fully develop the story and characters as she normally does. In fact, you can get the entire story from what the Amazon.Com review provides. A reader needs to go no further than the flaps on the cover of the book."
2,Hm...,"I can't recall this book off the top of my head. I think I've read it, but am not sure. And seeing as how I can't recall, it couldn't have been all that good."
4,Much Better!,"It's an old, but good story. I actually like the characters. Give me more at the end, though...what happens??? Give it a try!"
2,The House on Hope Street,"Disappointing..... The House on Hope Street is not one of Danielle Steel's better works. The story is pretty much described on the book cover and does not vary much from that content. I was disappointed that she did little to expand on this story. It was a let down after reading ""The Wedding"". Danielle Steel can certainly do better!"
4,We all need a little hope,"I found The house on Hope Street to be very inspiring, that after the loss of Liz's husband Jack she continued on with her life, facing more trauma as her son was seriously injured only to find someone who eventually became her lover. It shows us how in life that there are tragedies, and that history can not be reversed, but life does go on. I would recommend this book to everyone, and look forward to her next book!"
3,A nice summer read,"Danielle Steele has done it again! In The House on Hope Street, she has managed to develop characters we truly care about, and situations many have faced or will have to face sometime in the future. Liz, Bill, Jaimie, and Peter are all well developed characters. My only criticism is that the girls and Jack don't come across as people about whom we can really care. All in all though, the book was an enjoyable summer read and I strongly recommend it to Danielle Steele fans everywhere."
4,DS is back on track,"""The House on Hope Street"" is the best book Ms. Steel has written in a long time. She showed signs of her former self with ""The Wedding"" and with ""Hope Street"" she returns to the style that suits her best, telling a tale of love, love lost, and love found. This book is not without its faults, but it's obvious that it was written with more care than some of her recent works. It's a small book and therefore a quick read, but it avoids some of the pitfalls Ms. Steel has become prone to such as repetitiveness just to fill up pages.If you are a DS fan, you should enjoy this novel."
2,Quick Read,"This book was a quick read, but I was disappointed in the book. I have read every book that DS has written, but I have bought her recent books knowing before I buy them that they will not measure up to her earlier works. I love her historical novels, but even ""Granny Dan"" fell short of my favorites, ""Zoya"", ""The Ring"" and ""Thurston House"". I know her personal life has suffered greatly in the last few years and I suppose it's only expected that it would take a toll on her writing, as well. I will continue to buy her books with the hope that the ""old"" DS will re-emerge.This book has a good story, just not the plot and character developments I was hoping for. Even at her worst, DS is still worth the read."
2,No seagulls is a plus... but it's a little dated.,"This Cd is about 20 years old now and the recording sounds a bit thin, like rustling paper. I love that there aren't a whole bunch of squawking seagulls and that it's an ""Atlantic"" sounding beach, however. The market is flooded with big ""Pacific"" sounding ones in this genre. The price is ok, but all things considered, I like the Cape Cod Soundscapes series here better, and how each one is labeled with the individual beach."
1,"If it doesn't come in genuine Dremel packaging, it's not a Dremel","Having read the other reviews here, I am very leery about this particular product -- and vendor. It if comes sealed in a Dremel package, fine, but if not, this is bootleg and of bootleg quality."
2,I have the real dremel 9901,"I bought the real deal at Home Depot to cut some duct work. Not to plunge cut, I used a drill bit to cut 4 holes at the corners, then tried to use the 9901 to laterally cut across the plenum for the duct work. Its a joke. Doesn't work , chatters, smokes, and just wont cut worth a darn. I really wanted it to cut a circle duct hole in the sheet metal plenum of the furnace, but decided to try it on a rectangle one first and was greatly disappointed. So not even the official dremel 9901 works for sheet metal as they claim on the packaging. I think the one review here is an accurate one for this tool when they say it worked great for carving a pumpkin. I believe that it what it is good for."
1,Breaks Easily,"I got this to cut through 12 gauge steel. It only made a dent in the steel before it broke. It also ""chattered"" which is probably due to the coarse cutting grooves. I switched to a cheap diamond cutter and although it was slow, it did the job."
2,Bad knockoffs,"Whatever these are, they are NOT Dremel 9901s. They mic out at 3/32"" at the cutting head, whereas 9901s are 1/8"" from shaft to head. Additionally, 1 of the 3 I ordered has burn marks on the metal, indicating it may have lost its temper. Finally, they do not arrive in Dremel packaging. They come in a plastic baggie with a sticky label on it.If you are surface scrolling, these might work fine for you. If you are slotting, you will NOT achieve the size slot you need with these!"
4,It will cut metal...,"I read a few reviews about getting two that are not in Dremel packaging, they seem to be from a certain seller or sellers other than Amazon. I made sure to buy the one being sold by Amazon and it came in Dremel packaging.The bit will cut through metal because I used it with the Dremel circle cutting guide to cut a hole in sheet metal. The bit had a tendency to pull itself out of the collet while cutting but that was solved by literally tightening the crap out of the collet. My collet might also be getting worn out because it's several years old by now.I think this bit is mostly intended for engraving, but it will cut through thin metal, it just takes a long time. Be sure to take breaks and let your tool cool down otherwise you may overheat it."
2,Scent too much/Use spray bottle,"I like the lotion, but the scent is way too strong and anything- pillows, cloths, etc.- that come into contact with your head will smell as well.Added 5/24/08- I found a little spray bottle which makes it easier to put a small amount on your hair- with this, Its 4 stars."
2,A Misleading Title,"The title of the cd is ""Tropical Surf"" but what I didn't know until I listened to it was that the entire one hour recording consists of waves and chirping birds. If you love songbirds, then this cd is for you. If you just want a relaxing cd with beautiful ocean waves, I would not recommend this album."
2,GREAT SURF AND A BIRDIE TANTRUM,"A great recording of surf, one of the best, but there is a bird. This bird doesn't fly away, he stays about the same distance from the microphone the entire time. About 30 minutes into the recording he began to have a birdie tantrum, something upset him, but he stayed and stayed. I gave it a 2 star for surf. If they can edit out the bird and just let us have the wonderful surf then it would be worth the money, but as it is skip it, it is not for sleeping."
3,"A good CD, but...","You know that Simpsons episode where Homer tries to soothe Marge by making ocean sounds? He first shooshes some waves, then he imitates the sound of a buoy, then he wakes her up with a horrible bird screeching, and then he tops it off with a pirate's ""Arrrr, Matey."" This CD is sort of like that, without the buoy and the pirates."
4,Best desert outdoors book I've read,"This is honestly the best book I've ever read on hiking, backpacking, 4WD travel, and mountain biking in desert areas.A big book, it covers both North America and world deserts, and provides much more specific information and advice than I've found in any other desert hiking books. Though not billed as a 'desert survival' book, there's actually more survival information in here than in a dedicated desert survival book (and the material isn't limited to U.S. deserts, either).No, this isn't a trail guide for a quick in-and-out foray on some manicured desert path, instead what you get is a very detailed how-to on learning the art of safely traveling the wildest and most remote desert areas - whether it's solo backpacking or planning a desert 4WD expedition. If that's what interests you, this is THE book to get.[...]"
4,Good Hiking Book,I like to hike in mountainous regions and found this book to be resourceful and accurate. The author must hike and camp alot because it covers everything I needed.
1,A fools handbook,"If you go exploring in hiking boots with hiking socks and walking poles, you'll probably like this book. If, on the other hand, you routinely carry a 6 gal water jug in your truck, next to the high-lift and tire repair kit, then you probably already know better than just about everything this author suggests, or can come up with better ideas simply by thinking. Bring water, know where you are, have a plan in mind if someone gets hurt. Basics that anyone with any sense knows.If you DON'T know better, then find someone to take you out and show you the ropes. This book does nothing so well as reassuring unprepared and inexperienced novices and encourage them to get in over their head. Much of the advice in here seems ill-advised and the rest, impractical. I think so poorly of this book that I refused to give it to a friend of mine who wanted it."
3,Great but with rerservations,"We loved this stake puller until the gripping edges lost their bite and started slipping on the smooth stakes we were using to support our structures at Burning Man. The pivoting gripping piece should be made of harder metal. That would have made this one a 5 star tool.Works great with Re-Bar, but the form stakes we use gave it problems."
2,wood stake puller,"i purchased the stake puller primarily for wood stakes. the concept of the puller is OK but the performance is useless for anything you cant pull out by hitting side to side and pulling out by hand. the jaws for the stakes are to short and the peg just slips off when you apply pressure. if the jaws were at lease an 1.5"" long the tool would probably work better. it doesn't seam like there was much product testing when it was designed.bottom line if your pulling wood pegs 2' or more in the ground don't waste your money unless you plan on modifying the puller."
5,Great bang for your buck,"This reel is a great value for the price you pay. Sure there are nicer reels out there, but why pay for them when you can get good quality here. I pair this up on a 6'6"" M spinning rod for river fishing in my kayak and it is an awesome set up."
3,Train Man - Left At The Station,"Deuterman's TRAIN MAN is akin to a Chinese dineer. It is good through most of the courses, but after it's over, it leaves you wanting more. This is not always a good thing. The problem with this novel is in the ending. While there are numerous shortcomings as far as the premise is concerned, the real crisis is in the ending. Deuterman gives the reader a central character in the Major from Anniston, works him into a key player in the plot development, then ignores him at the very last. We may want to know the fate of the hero and heroine, but what about the other players? If they are not significant then why spend so much time and effort making us want to follow them through their plight? Curious readers (i.e., me) want to know."
5,A griping tale,"Diverse threads and characters that come together to form the story. Deutermann has become a Master Storyteller who will hold you from start to finish. Do not start the last several chapters near bedtime or you will end up tired the next day. The characters are real and sometimes flawed, but always worthy of our attention."
2,Too Technical,"I am a Deutermann fan, but this book was a big disappointment. Deutermann spends way too much time describing the technical details of bridges and bombs, which I found miserable to read. The characters weren't nearly as enticing as in his Richter series. His book SPIDER MOUNTAIN was superb, a thriller I couldn't put down. So if you read this book and don't like it, don't give up on Deutermann, try another of his books."
3,Something a little bit different,"An interesting read because of the subject matter, trains and bridges. We still have the FBI hunting a serial killer, but the bad guy is smart and really doesn't plan to hurt anyone, just the SOB railroads who have done him wrong. Too much time spent on a wacko army officer, detracts from the impact of the story. You'll enjoy the difference."
5,Bible Products,"The product that I ordered was in excellent condition when I received it!However, I was disappointed that it arrived 17 days after the projected delivery date."
2,Very Upset!,"I did receive my KJV Bible on CD. I gave it to my dad and I should have waited until Christmas but I decided to go ahead and give it to him anyway. Needless to say if you knew my father he waits for nothing.Later that night he came over and showed me the very 1st CD in the case. It was not only cracked but it was scratched in HALF. Out of all of the CD's this was the only one that was damaged.Well, we returned this product and got a new one within 3 days. I just want to let anyone know if they decided to buy this product rip off the plastic and open it before you give it to anyone to make sure ALL OF THE CDS ARE INTACT!The product itself is wonderful and it is beyond my comprehension that one of the CDS could have been damaged in this way. It was not damaged during shipping as I have said that every other CDS was completely fine.The damage that occurred look purposeful as it was not just a crack in the CD but long scratches that were in so deep it cause the CD to crack!"
2,Too Many CDs,"It's nice to have in the library, but ended up buying a three CD set of MP3s about a year later of the same recordings. Came in a nice case though and it is nice to have in the library as I said."
4,gift for husband,I bought these for my husband for when he needs help with the pronumciation of the names and places in the bible for his sermons. The only complaint so far is it is missing a few verses on one of the disks.
5,Among the Finest,Anyone that wuld rather hear the word of God rather than the distractions of the world while driving will love this. It is wonderful.
1,Not the real thing,"This is a misleadingly titled book. Austin Fagothey's RIGHT AND REASON is a classic textbook of Catholic moral thought. Its definitive edition is the Second, revised by the author himself, and published in 1959. It is available in a reprint from TAN publishers, ISBN 0895556685. The book listed here is the first edition, arbitrarily revised by another author, whose changes and additions are not always faithful to the intentions of the original author, the author's favored (Thomstic) tradition of ethical thought, or the teachings of the Catholic Church."
1,Outdated,"This text was required by a decrepid nun-professor who still uses notes whe wrote back in the 70s on a typewriter. A sweet enough lady, just misinformed, and further misinforms students using this textbook. Not cool."
5,"Un libro completo, sistematico y práctico","Este es un libro práctico, con una fundamentación clara, que se basa no solamente en la consideración de autores destacados, sino sobre todo del legado de una filosofía perenne. Los capítulos se organizan por temáticas en las cuales se discuten los problemas éticos considerando sus diferentes puntos de vista, pero resolviéndolos siempre -cuestión que otros textos en la actualidad descuidan-. No se pierde en discusiones que no llegan a nada, procura aterrizar y normar la conducta.Una lectura imprescindible para aquella persona que desee formarse un criterio claro para manejar temáticas controvertidas.Llevo usando este libro desde hace 7 años como texto con mis alumnos con estupendos resultados.Las múltiples ediciones y traducciones del libro hablan por sí mismas."
2,Want to be depressed. Need to cry. Read this.,This book is very depressing. The girl at the beginning is full of hope and she is a little naive. Then the world begins to crash down upon her. Almost everything bad that can happen does.I almost had a nervous breakdown reading this. It makes you lose faith in the world and in man.
2,Painful...,"I had to read this for a class and, halfway through, opted to just make up answers on any further tests."
3,"good dictionary, shoddy printing","The dictionary is well put-together and covers a lot of info(pronunciation, grammar, recipes) as well as just the translations. I could case less if the authors follow whichever Spanish Academy's alphabet arrangement. What turns me off about this book, however, is the shoddy quality of the printing, which would make it hard to read in low-light and isn't pleasant to read in any light. I have the 2004 ed, maybe they fixed the more recent editions."
4,"Impacto Crea cantando Frankie Hernandez, invitado Cheo Feliciano","Tremenda produccion musical del grupo Impacto Crea que cuenta como invitados para esta grabacion a Cheo Feliciano interpretando 2 temas y tocando el trombon el virtuoso miembro de la Fania All Stars Reinaldo Jorge. Cheo tambien grabo con Impacto Crea en su album ""Cobarde"". Impacto conto con famosos salseros como invitados en sus primeras grabaciones. Entre estas se destaca su unica produccion navideña donde contaron como invitados con Ismael Miranda y Adalberto Santiago. En este disco tambien se destaca en la parte vocal el fenecido sonero Frankie Hernandez, quien milito en varias ocasiones durante su trayectoria en la orquesta de Bobby Valentin con quien pego el super hit ""Huracan"". Frankie tambien tuvo una destacada carrera como solista con varios hits durante la era de la Salsa Romantica en la decada de los 8o."
4,Charming movie,"The story was charming and the acting was good, but not great. Ray Liotta did well with this part considering his range. Overall a nice story, though it does require a little ""suspension of disbelief"""
4,Huge Cornhusker Fan,"I really enjoyed this book. I am a huge Cornhusker fan, therefore, this book was very entertaining to me...If you are interested in the history of Nebraska football, then this is the book for you. It really goes into detail about the whole program."
2,Disapointed.,"I was disapointed in the book. For [the price]..(the total cost with shipping) I was expecting much more. It is only 32 pages long. The total number of pages in books should be included in description. However, the book is accurate in it's details and the photography is good. I was just expecting much more, considering the price."
3,It's okay,"Hooked on the 60's is okay. It's not as good as the Classical series though. I'd probably not buy it again but since I have it, it's good to hear now and then."
4,Fast and fun,"I love this cd. It does little snippets of a bunch of songs. It is fast and up beat. I love to work to this cd, it keeps me motivated."
2,snore!,Avec les yeux is decent but the rest is really boring French variété almost. I am very surprised because he has in the past done some really great stuff.
2,Out dated,I bought this because is was reasonably priced and I figured I could use it for a long time. Unfortunately it will expire in 6 months.
3,disappointed,"Made nicely, but when I received it brand new light did not work. Its still going to be used, but the light option is sort of what sparked my interest. It does have the option of unscrewing the bottom and replacing the round lithium battery, but since I just bought it I should not have to!! The inside cup pulls out which is nice to empty and clean. Good buy, but darn that light. Lol. UPDATE after time passed...I ended up buying one that works at Target, the light still works to this day, so I never really actually used this blue one. If I had more people in the car smoking, Ill still be happy I have an extra one lying around:-)"
4,auto ash tray,"The Mood Light Ash Tray works perfectly in my car, at first it kind of bounced around in my cup holder. But a little Velcro and it's snug as a bug now, the lid opens in 3 positions (up fully and the LED light turns on and glows from the bottom up). The ash tray itself comes out for easy washing. The only negative I have and why I did not give this product 5 stars, is that the LED light would have been better placed in the lid itself or glow around the ash tray rim. Thereby seeing the inside part of the ash tray at night would be much easier. Other than that the item works much to my satisfaction."
3,Too Small!,"This is a nice concept, but it's too small for my cupholder and rattles around. I had to stuff things around it. I don't know of any cupholders that are that small a diameter."
4,I loved this album back then...,"When you're a George fan, you're simply a George fan...and I've purchased every single piece of music he has ever made and I've managed to find the good in all of his recordings, i.e., Broken Glass. The reason why I enjoy George's music so much is because it does not matter which genre he choses, his keyboard and piano skills are still superior to most and his arrangements are still very creative. On this particular recording, Thief in the Night, I Surrender, Why and Remember the Sixties were my favorites. Josie James and Lynn Davis were still kicking strong background vocals and George was having fun...or so it seemed...Doesn't matter to me...George's ""Face the Music"" and ""Muir Woods"" are probably the best CDs I've ever heard in my entire life, but ""Thief"" was pretty good especially for that particular time period when pop music was popular."
4,Medium GD,"The level of an album of GD is always high, but this isn't one of the best works of George Duke. Featuring Louis Johnson, Paul Jackson, Jr., Steve Ferrone, Paulinho da Costa, Ricky Lawson, John Robinson. Track 3. REMEMBERING THE SIXTIES is written with Stevie Wonder remembering political and musical events of the sixties. Track 8. WHY has Jon Fiore on Lead vocals. Track 9. LA LA is my favourite."
1,Worst George Duke Album EVER!!! I want a refund!!,"I have been a George Duke fan forever. Since ""Reach For It"" I have bought most of his albums/cds. I like almost everything as musicians always go through changes and phases.I loved him with Frank Zappa, John Scofield too.I love his funkier stuff and I just ordered ""Dukey Treats"" as I listened to the samples and it sounds like the George Duke I know and love.BUT..THIS ALBUM IS A SELLOUT. WHAT AN ABSOLUTE TURD! ONE OF THE WORST PEICES OF CRAP I HAVE EVER HEARD IN MY LIFE! Songwriting is crappy-music is sequenced, drum machines everywhere and not one cut saves the album. It's like his producer or somebody he owes money to said "" I want an album now and I want it to sound Top 40ish"" Well George , you missed the boat in this one-ITS NOT TOP 40 ITS NOT FUNKY -ITS JUST CRAP and if I could have found your email address, I would seriously ask for a refund for this horrible piece of crap! If you like George Duke-YOU WILL HATE THIS CD!! DON'T BUY IT!!!!"
5,owner MEDDASSCO L.L.C.,I have used this vibrator with great results for the past year. I have abused it and every time I pull it out of the truck it works like the day I bought it. If you need a concrete vibrator I would highly recomend this one.
2,Too many birds to sleep to,"This product did not help me get a good night's sleep. The occasional bird calls were just too distracting for me. From other reviews it sounded like there were only a couple and I thought I could tolerate that, but it was much more than a couple. I would return it, but the packaging is open. The sound quality though is very good, it's crisp and clear."
5,Jamie's Review on Lottie's Courage,"Lottie's Courage was an intriguing book with many exciting, as well as touching scenes about two runaway slaves and their adventures. Though fictional, it contained a lot of real information about the Civil War which I didn't know very much about. Even though it was sad in parts (it almost made me cry), that was part of what made it so good. Though the whole book was terrific, I would have to say my favorite scene was when a balloon came down and saved Lottie and Weza from the terrorizing dogs that captured slaves. It's hard to believe that someone can do such outstanding writing. Exellent Job!"
5,Inspired,"I could hardly believe this book was written in 1992! The plot is eerily familiar given the events of Sept. 11. I can only conclude that the author was inspired. This book is a wonderful read! The plot is riveting in the best style of Tom Clancy and the characters are complex and full, you feel you know them. It is also a fine book to read if you want to understand the place religion and the Christian faith have in our country now and what the founders of our country intended! The issues covered in the wonderful fiction should be discussed daily in our schools, places of business and homes, if I made only one recommendation this year I would say READ THIS BOOK!"
2,Bleah.,"Do not bother; very, very lightweight underdeveloped stories and not even I could suspend my disbelief on 2 of the three... And the third was plain ol' ""flat"". Such a disappointment, especially with Ms. Laurens' name on it. Sad."
3,I guess I should have read other peoples review,"I just bought athe book to have a New Years theme to read on New Years. If I had others review I would have known I already bought & read the Stepahnie Laurens story. I would have found out that the Rachel Gibson was a modern romance (I don't like modern romances) So I wasted my $0.99, how horrible (holding up my sarcasm sign). The stories were cute and a quick read but investigate, don't judge a book by its cover."
3,just ok,"I bought this because I am a new fan of Rachel Gibson - one of the authors in this book. I loved her story, but I wasn't a fan of the other two. Those stories were set in the early 1800's if I remember correctly. Historical romances aren't my kind of book. If you like that time period you might like them better than I did."
5,A total ambient experience,"Since I was given this album two years, it has easily become my most listened to disc. Not only during those times of the day when you just need to gear down a bit and collect your thoughts, but at night when it's not uncommon for me to put it on when I go to bed and have it recycle all night long. It really helps me to fall asleep and stay asleep all night long. I like to imagine I'm bunked out for the night in the protective cover of my tent and as a gentle rainshower falls outside. The dynamics of the recording allow you to use your imagination for the ambient experience that you want."
3,Rain with crickets and birds,"As one reviewer said this rain CD has the sounds of crickets and birds towards the end. If you are looking for only the soothing sound of rain with no birds, crickets, thunder or other annoying things, I recommend ""Sounds of the Earth: Rain in the Country"". The ""Rain in the Country"" CD is a clear recording of a steady rainshower. It is so relaxing that I bought 3 copies of it just in case they ever stop selling it."
3,Sounds like white noise or bacon frying,"Really wanted to like this rain shower, but as hard as I tried, couldn't get into the white noise sounds. Crickets and bird noises were not a problem."
5,Sure cure for insomnia,"Found this at a local library around 20 years ago, bought a copy and after quite literally about 10,000 rotations it is finally making some clicking noises towards the end and waking me up. I didn't think you could wear-out a cd there being no surface contact with the lasar and all, but the noise is there nonetheless so I guess you can. I'm sure I could probably sleep without this thing but at this point it is so ingrained into my subconsious that it is like audible crack. The delicate decrecendo of the rain over an hour-long period, balanced by the soft chirpings of birds and crickets will lull you into oblivion."
4,hannah's hope,This is the 4th in the Red Glove Series. I enjoyed it but perhaps not as much as the first three.
3,Bought it for a gift,"I can't rate the actual book, because I bought it for a gift. The arrival, packaging and product was quick and as described. My dad seemed please with the book."
4,Kelly Screedmatic STDXXX Concrete Screed,"Overall this product is a labor saving device. the Kelly Screed matic is a quality built piece of equipment sensibly built. We were able to pour 10 yard pours in under an hour with only three workers. It enabled us to simply fill the form quickly and then screed it off perfectly in only one pass. The flexibility of the variable length screed boards is great for different sized forms. We found it worked just as well with long boards as short ones. We were able to pour 3-4"" slump and screed it off very quickly. When the forms were pulled we were very pleased to see that the concrete was packed completely with no honeycombing at all. It's a great product to have around for concrete work but just not quite five stars."
5,"Good, Fast, Efficient","So far it's been a great product. heats up fast, stays hot and great controls as well.I would recommend it very much!"
3,"Well-intentioned, but flawed","On an alternate Earth that is shaped like a torus rather than a sphere, Charles Lindberg, Amelia Earhart, and Howard Hughes race against a team led by the Red Baron himself to be the first to travel completely across the planet's unknown side. Along the way, they encounter monsters and lost civilizations. This story is intended to be a grand, old-school adventure romp, and it succeeds intermittently, but the action often becomes confused, many of the situations are stock, and there isn't enough direct interaction between the rivals. The early parts of the story are the best."
4,A Workbook that Works!,"Rebecca Laird has turned Dr. Weatherhead's masterpiece into a user-friendly work. Though the original book (The Will of God)was certainly easy to read, Laird's working process helps the reader to personally apply the concepts of the Intentional, Circumstantial, and Ultimate Will. I used this as a personal, individual study book. But, after experience in many religious study groups, I believe this well thought-out, understandable, and thought-provoking workbook would be an effective group tool. It lends itself to both quick applications and in-depth growth. I appreciated the growth potential and the non-preachy attitude. Guidance to finding my own answers and positions was much preferable to being molded into a preconceived format. Yes! I recommend it!"
3,A study for mature Christians,This is a good study based on WWII sermons by Weatherhead. It should be for mature Christians because of complicated theological issues that have to be resolved.
2,Do you like watching fight scenes?,"That's it. Don't expect anything more than a bare unoriginal storyline. Loads of inconsistencies, like showing the same boat sometimes appearing to go North, then South, then inland and sometimes in the middle of an ocean .. I don't know. It pretty much summarizes the movie. Lots of fight scenes interspersed with random cuts to scenes that for the most part are just filler and barely tie what plot there is together.Not being an admirer of fight movies, I can't claim to be an expert, but I'm sure I've seen better in older films .. and the settings are so contrived, I thought I was watching a video game.Good points: It wasn't so bad that I couldn't sit through it."
2,ummmmmmm.....not that good,"for some reason,i did not like this movie.the only part i liked was the part where van damme was tied ip to the cross and then he kicks it down.this movie,i thought was darker and gloomier than most other van damme movies,and thats part of the reason that i didn't like it.overall boring,and didn't keep my attention"
3,Worth getting if you are a Van Damme Fan,"Blue-ray picture was way better than I expected. I've seen the film at least a dozen times in other forms, but was surprised to notice details in the film I never noticed before. Only thing wrong with the blue-ray........ No Extras!"
1,The World ended and everyone went to the gym,"Plot? None. Acting? None. Suspense? None.Action? Not! Go watch Jet Li or Jackie Chan for speed and technique, or a mixed martial arts match for realism.I do have to say that every guy in this move looked like he just stepped out of a gym and 1980s hair salon.Don't by this worthless movie."
1,When quality doesn't count you can count on Van Damme,"Cyborg is a typical Van Damme movie. All the action you can handle and none of the quality you desire.You get the typical splits and man-'ttocks sweetness from Van Damme.Some how Van Damme on foot is faster than a tug boat. Also, open fields in a grass covered savannah-like areas have man-holes and massive labyrinths-like systems below.You do get an unexpectedly nice mullet on the main villain, as well as some top-notch dialogue.All in all, if you're forcing yourself to watch the entire Van Damme catalogue, you'll have to watch this one too! Generally shipping is going to be about 25% higher than the price of the movie, so you win on all fronts!Be a man, give yourself what you deserve, watch Cyborg."
3,horror film,the cyborg in the film is wonderfully done. the fight scenes in the film were laughable. the story line is great and the girls in the film were strong of charater
1,Van Damme's rock-bottom worst...,"Director Albert Pyun has done it again. He's taken an interesting premise and muddled it with monotonous dialogue, jittery action, pointless camera angles, and an irritating feel. Pyun, who also directed the similarly awful ""Omega Doom,"" is my absolute least favorite director and this movie shows why. Every scene in this movie looks dirty, gross, and disorienting. Added to this are horridly awful performances including a young Jean-Claude Van Damme, who should've stayed far away from this. Word has it that Pyun and Van Damme did not get along while filming. I'm not surprised. Van Damme looks bored in every scene and this is his absolute worst performance; it's even worse than ""Maximum Risk!"" Two more sequels were made, but they're even worse. Van Damme fans like myself ignore this shlock. We've seen better from him."
5,great flick,This is one of my personal favorite Van Damme movies. Really great to watch on blu ray. Hopefully we can get more JCVD movies released on blu ray cough cough Hard Target cough cough
1,an example of what a Live Action Anime could be like....,"If done horribly wrong. Cyborg whether the creators realized it or not has a strong Anime feel to it. Sadly the movie is complete and total garbage.The story here is that Jean Claude Van Damm plays a warrior in the future who is out to get revenge on the leader of a gang in the Anarchist future. There also happens to be a deadly disease plaguing Mankind, and a Cyborg knows the cure. That part of the story is irrelivant. For the most part it is Van Damm traveling across the US attempting to catch up to this Madman and stop him. Somewhere in the movie we get flashbacks of his past and at one point he gets the chance to bang his female companion. OVerall this movie is a waste and you can tell Orion Entertainment was Milking Van Damm for all he was worth at this time. Avoid."
3,Old Van Damme,"In 80's he rore with all kick ass moives this one may be just in between, if you like to kill time thats your movie"
1,IF IT WAS A COMEDY...,"If you watch this as a comedy, you'll give it 5-star, because you will laugh so much with the absurd sequences, the bad acting, the outrageously bad scrrenplay, the lousy special effects, that you'll really enjoy yourself. But if you rent (or buy() this one thinking it to be a good action movie by An once great action star, you'll really fell betrayed by the producers,; you'll be angry."
1,GARBAGE + GARBAGE = GARBAGE !,"This is simply one of the biggest garbage they have ever put on film! Everything is ridiculous here, the set (low budget!), Van Damme (as always). The ending is fun, when some bad guys appears. They seem to have been taken directly from a gymnasium, where they probably wrre lifting weights, so bad is their acting! Horrible!"
3,This movie was O.K,"Im a big Van Damne fan,and when i saw this movie i expected alot more,but it was still good.I dont know if its worth watching.But atleast he gets to fight a dude."
4,Van-Damage Saves the Future!,"Jean Claude Van-Damage is bombastically effective in a post-apocalyptic future where starvation and disease are plaguing the last handful of human survivors. While scientists are close to discovering a cure for the plague that is ravaging the country, Gibson Rickenbacker proves to be a badass kick-boxer (of course) who leads a ragtag group to Atlanta (where else?) to obtain info necessary for the cure. Ah, but the road to salvation is fraught with bad guys to fight! Karate CHOP!"
5,Distinctive and perceptive,"This is a marvellous book. Digby has written a very accessible book of interview with Australian female poets. The best thing about this book, for me, is the way it captures the ebb and flow of the creative process and the determination of female creators in the face of ridicule and discrimination."
5,beatnik adventure for the 21st century,"If you want to live on the edge but don't want to take the risks involved, this book is a good way to do both. It showed me a world that I normally would never venture into.The author's tales are interesting and his honesty and craziness are reminiscent of the beatnik writers of the 50s and 60s."
3,Not bad not great,"Ok book- nothing really new, but the 4 bucks for it as a download at LULU was fairly ok. Its not what i'd call a 'survival' guide as much as a rough tour- but since most of us have no real intention of becoming fully mobile thats not a real prob. Dont look for life changing revalions though.Wish the dude well, and hope the money i spent helps him pay to get his van fixed."
1,Not Worth the Effort,"Having read the book. Its a vain attempt to make funds to pursue a Bums life. Self Published I assume. His 10 Book/20 Book toursare nothing more than a attempt to get from one place to another.His reference to his email list, Is another attempt to get his name again in print. This author shold make a attempt to write more of real life , than a book about ""bumming""This book would appeal to the early 20,s mindset. As the author attempts to portray a nobel lifstyle.Its not worth the price of buying,, Not even at a yardsale.His political views really disflavor this read. Author should grow up and realize life is not a FREE ride.Appparent his buddies are writing the Pro reviews.In conclusion, its not worth the price of a mere candybar."
2,Blur Disappointment,"""Music is My Radar"" must be one of Blur`s weakest singles. Compared to classic singles like ""The Universal"", ""Beetlebum"" or ""Coffee and TV"" this is a bit of a disappointment. The song simply lacks melody.I like ""Black Book"" much better - even though it`s a typical Blur B-side.The 2 live tracks are good, and they help the general impression of this single-release."
2,"Neat reference, but mostly pro wrestling junk","This book is interesting, it's not really an instructional, it's more of a reference for a variety of pro wrestling holds that you don't see much anymore.There are some good techniques that work on live opponents, but there is almost no explanation on how to perform any of them. Most of the techniques require multiple complicated moves and would not work on a living, conscious opponent."
3,Good Techinques with Humor same thing for $7.99 @ USBJJ.COM,"Judo Gene LeBell knows his finishing holds. However, there is way too much humor and not enough effective holds. Alot of the holds are ""pain"" holds-- meaning they would cause some pain but a determined opponent will not submit to them. I fought NHB I know what I'm talking about. ""Submission"" holds by definition make the opponent submit or quit or you will break his arm, leg, etc. or choke him unconscious. If you want 100% submission holds with no humor and WWF pain holds go to USBJJ.COM where for $7.99 you can get hundreds of finshing holds, many of the exact same ones here, without humor and without worrying about whether this is a painful inconvenience hold or a real submission hold."
2,not what you expect...,"this book i hate to say was a dissapiontment and would not really recommend it to anybody that was half serious about learning how to do submissions. i like gene lebell but hate to say that more than half the moves in this book could not be performed on anybody that has any idea about the grappling game. there are a FEW moves in this book that could be usefull. but i would recomend going with another title if truely wanting to learn good submissions. this book does have some hummer in it though, but aside from that and the few good moves i dont think this would be a good route to go,if agian you are serious about grappling. please dont mis-understand me, gene is the man, he just didint prove how true that is with this book. agian, im still a fan, just trying to be helpfull to others"
2,Expensive and not worth the trouble,"This is expensive for a pci graphics card. You are better off investing in a newer system than upgrading a dying model. This video card costs as much as cards that are way better performers. This card can play some new games, but expect them to run very slow. This card should only be bought if there is absolutely no way to upgrade to a better computer. This card might have been good a few years ago, but as it stands today it is obsolete. You can purchase an agp version of this card cheaper, but it is still old becoming obsolete. You can purchase an ATi x1600 for around the same price, and get much more bang for your buck."
2,Disappointed,I am unhappy with the performance and colors. I haved learned once again not to just look for a percieved value. I hoped this card would smoke my integrated graphics but it failed. Spend more money on a better card.
4,Impressive but cool,"These magnificent works of art by Stravinsky are being played and recorded by numerous orchestras and the Minnesota Orchestra under Mr. Oue has made a startling performance of it. But there are some catches to it, and I think it is the excellence of the performance that bothers me most. Especially in the Firebird there is a lack of prominence, a lack of joy de vivre, and although the drumbeats are breathtaking, the intentions of Stravinsky are not fulfilled. As a matter of fact, there are better performances than this one, i.e. The Firebird in its original setting by Gergiev on Philips or The Nightingale by Dorati on Mercury Living Presence. Most of my criticism is focused on the point that it does not sound Russian enough. The recording by Reference Recording is flawless, although you should turn up your equipment to a rather unusual high volume to hear all details."
5,What? No one has reviewed this yet:?,"I am pleased to recommend the Monsternomicon and its steampunk approach, which can easily be adapted to any campaign. Even if you use FR, the use of mechanics and firearms can have its place somewhere, and provides a great twist for adventures.The nomicon is lavishly illustrated, with pictures that harken to the early days of first edition. The art in this book is MUCH better than anything in the Creature Collections by S&S.; Great work from a D20 publisher, and anyone who runs a hardcore Iron Lands campaign shouldn't be without this. If you are a collectorand appreciate talent, soul and hard work, snatch this one up before they're all gone."
3,Where are the colors?,"I want to buy one of these, but even though the desription say it's in 4 colors there is no option to select the colors. I want the purple one!"
3,Not bad,"It's actually pretty decent. It's obvious that the studio they used wasn't the greatest quality, but the beats are good and it's something you cn bob your head to."
4,tiffany laptop caddy,I have had this product for about a week and so far I really like it. The only problem is the wheels do not role well on hardwood floors.
3,quality is what I expected.,"the quality is higher than what I expected after reading this guys review below me (the guy is a whinner!)I was actually regretting the purchase after reading his review (mine was on route for delivery).well, it only took me a whopping 15 minutes to put it together... the instructions are good. the parts come in bags with letters that are linked to the instructions. My guess is this guy ripped all the bags open then had to play jigsaw puzzle with the parts. LOLThey even provided a few extra bolts. the quality of the base is good and strong. it seems a bit unstable but balances fine with a laptop on it.I found the surface top (spattered counter top look)tacky... but I'm using it in a dark room so I could really care less.(*recent update looks like the complainer deleted his review too lol)"
4,Good Value,Good instructions enclosed with Laptop Caddy. Allen wrench was fine but open end box wrench enclosed was so small and flimsy it was useless. Used one of my own instead.This is well made and well engineered. I use it for a lot of things and recommend it.
2,You have been warned...,"I purchased this laptop caddy based solely on reviews and unfortunately, this time, reviews have failed me. Don't get me wrong, the caddy is stylish and easily fits under my bed, I couldn't be happier about the appearance of this. Here's where the negative comes in: I use my laptop on this caddy which I always leave sitting out on the caddy. One day I heard a loud crash and discovered my laptop on the floor! The tilting desktop part of the caddy had come loose so it literally flipped my laptop off! Fortunately my laptop survived, but I no longer trust this caddy. I now use the small, non-tilting part of the desktop to hold my laptop. Everyday when I check the screw which holds the tilting part in place, it is loose. I've taken pliers to it to try and tighten it but obviously, unsuccessfully. :( Had I known about this, I would have purchased a different caddy."
4,Nifty Liner Is Nifty!,"I've had the Cargo Liner for about a month now, and can say it is very nifty. The ability to securely hold items in place is wonderful. The liner is similar to OEM carpet in back of my Mountaineer (Explorer), and the color matched very well. Only negative thing I can say about it is that it only comes with 2 cargo locks. It really should come with 4, but you can buy additional ones. Overall a good product."
5,The Best Little TV,"I purchased this tv about two years ago, and so far it's been perfect. I love everything about it. The only thing I would've liked to have had with this tv (which I did with my last), is the option to press rewind and have the tv turn off by itself when done rewinding, it's not really a big deal, but it was useful.This tv sits on a table at the end of my bed, I have accidently kicked it off twice in my sleep, and the tv works and looks as if that never happen. So my guess is that it is a very well built tv. This tv everything you would expect a great little tv to be. Just to add, the speakers on the side don't go from the top to the bottum of the tv, it looks like they do, but they don't, it's just the design. The real speakers are on both sides, they are about 3 inches long."
3,Silly...,"I tend to agree that this one, despite its potential to be much better is not.The voices are top notch, and are not the problem but the artwork could have used some help and the script could have been better. Even very little ones these days are more sophisticated enough to handle something more meaty than this rendering. I will admit the songs do grow on you and while I did like the ""Sea of Time""-unfortunately it was the ""Titan Song"" that got stuck in my head-and wouldn't go away.I did like both the Hercules series and the Xena series when they were on, and I still miss them. I was looking forward to something fairly exciting, and while this did have the potential to be better than it was- potential was that was all that it had.Lets just say that this did not do any justice to the actors-or to those watching."
3,"Ok,but not great!","I was really looking forward to this movie a lot,but when I saw it,all I could think of was,""What a disappointment""! The storyline and voice work were excellent-I had no problem with that. My problem was with the animation. If anyone has read the Xena/Hercules comics,then I think you would agree that if the artistry of those comics had been used in this movie,the results would have been far better than what we got! I would not recommend this unless you are a die hard HTLJ or XWP fan."
1,This is so baaaaaaad!,This just sucked! Nothing like the TV show and a real snoozer. Totally for kids -- and even they will turn it off. Save your money!
2,Mulan is better than this one.,"I've seen this movie back in the early time of 1998 and now I rarely do, because the part about Xena turning into a falcon was an exception to the plot. This is more for fifth graders."
4,"cheesy, corny, but hirariously addictive","Okay, so this movie was pretty goofy and the animation isn't exactly Shrek quality, but I definitely think it's worth seeing. It seems to help to have a good sense of humor going into this. I can safely say that five out of six of my friends (mostly females from the ages of 17 - 20) enjoyed it quite thouroughly. It is filled with songs that somehow everyone knows the lyrics to them the first time. ;)If you are the type of person who can get through life without taking things too seriously, you would prolly enjoy this movie...besides, Artemis IS pretty cute!"
3,Great movie but animation BLOWS!,"this would have been a great movie if it was real and not animated. the animation was so crappy it ruined the movie, otherwise i give it a 3 out of 5."
4,Great Movie!!!,"This movie was excellent! The plot was not hard to follow although there were a lot of neat scenes and areas in which the plot thickens. I agree that the characters don't look to great and Xena's chakram only has dots, but technology isn't the whole movie it is the story that counts. I thought that they did a great job with the movie and I would always recommend this movie any die hard Xena&Hercules fan!!!"
5,LOVE IT!,I just bought it last week and I love it. Its been great on the dry skin I get in the winter. It cost less then 3 eruo here in Germany...i guess ill have to stock up before i move home.
3,shipped rolled up and hard to straighten,you still have to use glue because the backing tape has a gap around it.some come with white wrinkels through them getting bent from beiing rolled so tight i think
3,"Ok toy, but not what I expected","My daughter does like this toy and does play with it but I didn't realize that it wasn't seperate pieces. I thought the swing and the highchair were different pieces, they use the same stand. This makes a good toy to store or travel with sense it comes apart and doesn't take up much room. The travel seat handle is hard to adjust and the cloth cover slips of easily, as well as the stroller cloth cover."
2,Flimsy and doesn't hold up to child's play,"We got this for my twin daughters because they love to push things around and thought the stroller would be great. The only good thing IS the stroller with the doll in it without the travel seat. My daughters love to push the stroller around. The travel seat doesn't fit the stroller very well and keeps falling off. The high chair is flimsy (not the frame but the way the travel seat fits into the frame to make the high chair). The bassinet/cradle works is held into place cheaply and is lopsided even with the doll in it. Overall, this is a cheaply made item and not worth the price.We could have just purchased a stroller system for a lot less money."
5,Imperative of Facilitation,"Garmston and Wellman have written a book that belongs on the shelf of every administrator in the country. They outline practical strategies for creating action-oriented/outcomes-based collaborative groups in a school community. These strategies work in faculty meetings, parent meetings, classrooms, district meetings. In short, this is an excellent book that clearly delineates the best and proven practices from the fields of education, psychology, and business management for developing, motivating, guiding, and maintaining collaborative groups across the school community."
3,An almost book,The book is well written but some important information is missingLike how to create a visionAnd how to evaluate your progress
3,Where's the gold?,"For what this sucker cost, it should have had a bunch of gold nuggets dropping out of it when shaken!In all seriousness though, this unit is not nearly as loud as I thought it would be, but it is an exact replacement to the one that came on my boat that didn't work at all. Good wiring to it too, so it's not a resistance problem causing it to be a little quiet. And I haven't heard another of this horn blow to compare. When I do, I'll see if I can update this review. Likely won't happen until the warranty's up though! ;)"
4,Great Housing.,"I recently installed a stereo on my boat and used the Jensen housingas I felt it suited my needs.Since I mounted it in a cuddy cabin, exposure to the elements was not an issueso I can't vouch for this feature but the cover does make a good seal when it's closed.The mounting template made it a snap to install and since it comes apart,thestereo slips right in."
3,Good item,"This was a good selection. The problem is if you invert it, it is difficult to work with. Door seems tone sturdy."
5,Great Housing,"Great housing,Easy to install,Just measure your I-Pod first to make sure it fits.I had to modify it to fit my Nano 5th generation"
2,NOT waterproof!,"I bought this housing because it says it's waterproof, but it is not. Sent it back. There is a seal around the faceplate cover, but the rest of the thing is full of holes, the top and bottom halves have no seal between them, and the wiring/antenna exits in the rear are wide open. Bummer, 'cause I was excited about the little space on the right to hold an mp3 player, but that could have gotten soaked as well ..."
2,Not water proof at all,"The unit works pretty well in every respect but one key aspect... The cover won't stay closed. Kinda renders the idea of waterproofing invalid when the only thing between your stereo and the elements is a cover that just kind of sits closed and will pop open at the slightest bump or torque.Fortunately for me, I am using this in an old truck and not on a boat, so it doesn't cause me a problem. However, if you are considering this for your boat, you may want to save your receipt. I could have just got a bad one, but it seems more a design flaw than a manufacturing flaw.As a general car stereo mount it works great!"
3,Should be better,"I was a little disappointed in the product. The supplied hardware could have been better. The Rubber piece wasn't rubber at all, it was hard nylon. The short screws provided were in fact too short to do a proper job, I replaced them with longer ones.I would like to see the design be changed to route the cables out of the back up or down. The currently only route down which is fine for a on dash install but not so good for a under dash install.It should do it's main job well and that is to protect the radio."
4,"Good quality, happy, but the cover could latch a little better","This was just the product I needed to add a stereo to my pontoon boat which did not have one prior to my installation. The housing accepted the receiver great, has lots of room for pre-outs, wires, etc. The clip to hold the cover closed could be a little better. I ended up putting a web strap & buckle off an old life jacket around it to ensure it stays closed when the boat is parked. I just want to make extra sure the cover does not pop open & rain ruin the receiver."
4,Product arrived complete and intact.,"Everything showed up intact and on time. Can't beat that, might order some more just so I don't have to add more words."
4,corelle dishes,i got my dinnerware set very quick it came in about 2-3 days after ordering it online. i havnt used them yet but so far they look pretty decent. the pieces are alot smaller than i exspected them to be.
3,OK for the price,"I bought these elsewhere (starts with wal ends with mart) but i paid about the same price. The plates and bowls are pretty decent. They are light weight, easy to wash, stack easily and are fairly chip and break resistant. I dropped one large plate about 8 inches onto the corner of my counter top and there was no damage at all. The coffee cups might look like mugs but they aren't. They really don't hold enough and the handles are uncomfortable. I don't use them. I actually gave them away. Other than that this set is worth about $17 in my opinion."
5,Correlle dishes,"The product arrived on time . The dishes were of excellent quality. I would definetely recommend this product,for a starter set ."
4,Tired of ironstone cookware.,"For years we used Corelle Dinnerware. The pattern was out of date so I purchased a set ironstone cookware from khol's and never liked it. The ironstone dinnerware, especially the bowl's are too large and this makes it hard to load into the dishwaher. I wanted a basic pattern, this set is nice but could be improved upon by making one of the black rings a little wider. The black ring on a couple plates is very light making a couple pieces look cheap. The cup's are not made of the same material as the dishes and bowl's."
1,Corelle Dishes,These are not the quality I expected from Corelle. The plates are all warped and won't even lay flat in cabinet
4,Corelle Dinnerware Set Certainly Worth the Cost,"I am pleased with the set. However, the bowls are a bit small so I bought the larger sized bowls and the smaller plates really are dessert plates....I was thinking they were a bit bigger then they actually are. But all in all....I am pleased with my purchase and the design exceeded my expectations. I would recommend for college students and families with small kids."
5,So far...so good!,Was looking for dishes that could be trusted to hold up to a 4 and 7 year old. So far we are doing fine. Nothing broken and we have had the opportunity. The design is fine and mixes well with our nicer adult non-corelle pieces.
3,poor quality..,"The dishes came well packaged, but when I stacked them I realized that some of the plates are wrapped. You don't see it if they are on the table, but needless to say I am disappointed because I always thought it was a quality product."
5,Very nice and a great price from amazon!,"I ordered these dishes for my daughter who moved into an apartment for college. I used Corelle dishes for many years, they are durable, lightweight and practicle. They are very nice and this pattern is good for guys and gals. The new mug is so much better than the cups from many years ago."
3,"great, except - -","I totally like the dishes, the quality, their light weight, and ability to microwave etc. Only complaint is the small plate is too small."
5,Great,Corelle dishes are always great. They stack nicely and don't take up a lot of space and are quite durable. These look nice and were the right price. They came quickly.
4,Great for the price,"I bought these for my boyfriend's new apartment. He swears by Corelle and will only use their dishware. I used to work for an international fine china company, so buying these was like breaking the sacred vow of overpriced dinnerware consumerization.HOWEVER; these are great for the price and quality level. If you're looking for something inexpensive, not fancy, and durable, Corelle is definitely the way to go. They're light-weight, dishwasher and microwave friendly, and very easy to clean. Not prone to cracking or heat-breaks. Don't go slamming these around on granite countertops- they WILL break, like anything else (even the $50 a plate stuff I used to hawk). If you've got a vacation home, or just want some every day stuff, look into Corelle. They've got a lot of nice, newer designs that fit basically anyone's taste and budget."
4,Corelle Classic Cafe Black Service for Four,"Many years ago, when Corelle first came out, I had small children, and my sister gave me a gift of Corelle for Thanksgiving. It was wonderful because the children had broken so many plates and cups prior to this durable gift. Through the years, and many moves, I have used ordinary dinnerware. But now, remembering the good quality and other features of Corelle, I decided to rid myself of all the old, heavy dishes and get a small set of dinnerware just for me. I have arthritis in my hands, and the lightness of Corelle is perfect for me. Of course I love the retro look from diners of yore that I ate in as a young woman. Great buy!!"
4,New Corelle Dinnerware,"I've had Corelle Dinnerware dating back to sometime in the 1970s and I've loved everything about it. It's everything the descriptions say it is, very lightweight which makes it easy to carry to and from kitchen to Dining Room, or outdoors, and it always looks good. The new designs are interesting, although some are a bit too busy for my tastes, but I really like the Classic Cafe BlackCorelle Livingware 16-Piece Dinnerware Set, Service for 4, Classic Caf¿ Black. I purchased two sets to have a service for 8 and I'm seriously thinking of purchasing another two sets. I've received many compliments since I got these and am proud to set a formal dinner table as well as a picnic table with these dishes. Thank you Amazon.com for the quick, easy and reliable service."
4,corelle classic cafe black,"Being a corelle fan, I found this set to be well worth the price paid. The only negative I could find is that the small flat plate (commonly known as the salad plate/dessert plate) is just a tad too small for my needs. Other then that, it's perfect!"
5,Best Dishes Ever!,"These are so light weight and durable, I just LOVE them! Hardly take up any space in the cubbards. Easily come clean. Haven't chiped or broken any yet!"
3,Not un-breakable,"We bought this set as a Christmas present for ourselves last December. Since then, 2 of the dishes have broken ! One when a friend bumped his plate on the table before setting it down, the next when my husband put a small rotisserie chicken on one to carve it. Both times, the plates broke into several large pieces. We hardly use them anymore for fear it will happen again. Neither time was the dish, food or surface much different in temperature from each. So weird."
3,Thin... very thin!,"I bought these because I always heard good things about Corelle dishes. However, I'm a little disappointed. All the plates and bowls are super thin. I was expecting them to be a little bit thicker. But I guess you get what you pay for. I do like the design and they are super functional... I needed something to eat off and they work great for that! No more eating off the kitchen table or out of the pot. Yay!"
2,Plates are thin!,The plates are thin and plasticy so to speak. This was my first time purchasing plates online and I won't do it again. My advice is to go to your local Brandsmart and pick up a set there so you see what you're getting. Probably for less money too.
2,Hmm....,"I ordered this one after all the great reviews at Amazon, and after finding out that its a best-seller! But I'm a bit taken aback after receiving it - quite ordinary-looking, lines are not in perfection as you would normally expect from a company like Corelle. Maybe I'm biased towards floral-designs, but I certainly didn't find this one attractive enough for a home. A restaurant maybe, but not for a home."
2,light dinnerware,"I was looking for some dinnerware and making a matching 8 piece set. I was pretty suprised at how light these were. I had looked around previously, but did not know much difference between brands. These are thin and get cold easily.I think they would be great for getting started, but not for a everyday dining set. I will pay much bettter attention next time. But you get what you pay for."
1,Made in China,"I was on the phone with the Corelle cust. service dept to order this set. I happened to ask where this set was made. Discovered that the mugs are imported from China. Due to the huge number of products that have made American's ill over the past few years, I will not buy anything made in China so I cancelled the order."
5,Google Adwords,"Google Adwords are the amazing way for SME Business promotions in Global Markets.If you are the volume suppliers of clothes, electronics, toys ....etc.Reckon you can try it now."
2,"Nice, but... it's obsolete","Okay, why are people giving this book positive reviews when the most important thing in Adwords changed in early August and the book is now obsolete? Hello? The bid management tool CHANGED. No more 0.5% threshold. No more On-Hold system. That's gone. Didn't those ""reviewers"" notice this? If you want to work with Adwords and you're looking for a book on Adwords, you'll need to make sure the book covers the current state of Adwords."
3,Somewhat out of date but still pretty useful,"Google is the most popular Internet search engine, so having your ad pop up on its search results can be a boon for your business. The challenge is to get your ad to appear on the first page of search results by using just the right keywords. Author Andrew E. Goodman shows readers the best ways to play the AdWords game. The primary warning is that Google AdWords rules change faster than a book can be published, and they have changed since this book was issued. However, the book still provides valuable concepts and ideas for online ad campaigns. Learn how to select the right keywords, write copy, test your ads, modify campaigns based on collected data, set a budget and reduce the chances of attracting the wrong prospects. We believe this book gives readers a better understanding of how to work with search engine ads."
2,Lots of filler,"If you're an entrepreneur who needs some answers fast, you've come to the wrong place. The book is well written, but by chapter three, no ""HOW TO"" in sight. Lots of info on how google used to do this, or how Alta Vista tried copying them, or other info about google that you never wanted to know, but no help. Want to know about market share? No sweat. Want to know how to make proper use of Adwords? Three chapters and counting. No help in sight.Fourth chapter and we are finally talking about Adware... but only how the process works. Google offers this info freely, but it isn't offered as well as the info in the book and it isn't in one place. So, nice, but that's not why I bought the book.Fifth chapter. Set-up. Google has a wizard to get you started, so again, filler here. In my opinion, even if there is information in this book that I eventually deem lifesaving, the book still could have been at least five chapters shorter."
5,The first useful book on the foundations of Adwords PPC Marketing.,"It's nearly impossible to write, publish and release a book about online marketing and still remain up to date. Mr Goodman has done just that. Rather than focus entirely on the intricate details of search marketing, the Adwords interface and Google's forever changing marketplace, Goodman discusses basic concepts, best practices and common mistakes made by search marketers and PPC advertisers alike. I work in the affiliate marketing industry and can tell you first hand many of my own affiliates would benefit greatly from the concepts covered in this book. Goodman will help you build a foundation for success in the PPC market space that can easily be applied to any auction based PPC marketing system."
3,Dissapointed...,"I was a little disappointed when I got it in the mail and realized that it is RAM for laptops. The specifications said that it was compatible with Macs, or PCs. Nothing about laptops was mentioned once. However, the post-sale report was very good, aside from the mentioning of compatibility."
1,Mikasa missed on this one,"This is an ugly vase. So ugly we are returning it the day we received it. It does not measure up to Mikasa standards at all. It looks and feels like a cheap vase one would buy at Target. We were very disappointed. Stick to the clean, lean lines of other Mikasa crystal vases."
3,"gets the job done, but...","Many of his ""logical"" arguments fall flat, as another reviewer mentions. The style, while conversational, seems decades old and at times too ""churchy"". The best use for this book might be to study the Bible verses cited at the end of the chapters, and use the text as a reference for further explanation."
2,I'm in agreement,I'm in agreement with the previous viewer. The sound is okay but what exactly makes this a Cape Cod Cd?
3,maybe it's me,"Let me begin with the fact that many people I know ""love"" this book. I on the other hand do not. I have tried atleast 4 recipes all of which did not turn out the way they were suppposed to (after so many tries I place the book on a shelf and it can stay there). There are very nice discriptions throughtout the book and a nice dialogue but neither helped me or my frustrations. I am an accomplished baker and have never had the types of problems with recipes that I have had with this book. I would not say don't buy it as others have had great success with it. What I would recommend is to see if your library has it, try a few recipes and then decided if you can't live without it, before you buy it."
4,An exquisite art deck........,"The images in this deck are gorgeous, very stunning and colouful! The Devil is one of my all time favourites. The Ace of Swords is just breathtaking! That being said I keep this in my collection for the scrumptious art and style, as a reading deck it falls short for me in many respects.If you do look hard, you can see some meanings take form in the swirls and backgrounds, at times the person/s give little clues as well. But don't look for deep emotion on the faces. As well the images kind of blend together and it's not very deep nor profound in it's symbolism. A disappointment in that respect, this deck could have been an all-time favourite if the artist had just used more evocative imagery for each card meaning.If you love this flowing, magical and enchanting style of art....this deck will deliver a visual feast. You don't want to pass it up."
1,Italian horn pendant,"Not at all what I expected for the price. Was hollow and had seam in it. It looked like something you would get out of a cracker jack box, and the price of $70 was WAY!!!!! too much for this product."
2,Not what I thought I was buying,"I was looking for wooden puzzles like Melissa and Doug puzzles that are nice and stable. These puzzle pieces are flimsy and everytime my son lays a piece, the whole puzzle breaks apart. Wish the pieces were a little bigger or more heavier so the other pieces wouldn't fall apart."
5,Read This Book,"I just started Roy's latest book, First Hubby, which is a real hoot. WMDTW is funny and fascinating reading. Roy is one of the funniest guys around and very perceptive. Try it, you'll like it and his other books as well."
4,WAy FUNNNY,Take it from an Atlanta native (whose sister went to high school with RB) the chapter on southern hospitality is side-splitting!
5,Tungsten Carbide Cutter,I received and have used the Carbide Cutter. It arrived in a timely fashion and did the job that I purchased it for..
2,I was shocked that I didn't like it,"This CD is boring to me. I love his voice and love him as a person, but the only two songs I can stand to listen to is ""You raise me up"" and ""Oceano"". Wish there would have been more uptempo songs."
4,Amazing!,"Wow, Joah Groban has an amazing voice!Though I would have to agree, that to call his music opera, is acutely far from the truth!Sorry Josh..."
2,Same as last album..,"Josh Groban has such potential to create beautiful music with the voice he has. And I continue to buy his material in the hopes that he'll create that ""one song"" that makes it all worth it.Alas, this album has left me cold. Contrary to what people say, I don't believe he means what he sings. I hear him singing about love, but it sounds disinterested and aloof. The richness of his voice is there, but not the connection that I would feel with someone like Patty Griffin.This album is just like his last one. So, if you loved it, you will most likely love this one too. My best wishes to this talented singer. I haven't given up on you yet, Josh."
3,Overproduced!,"Leave his voice alone. That is why people buy his music.""Caruso"" has been sung far better than this. It was painful listening to his version.That said, his voice is still a stand-out in those tracks when you can actually feel his nuanced singing and not his yelling over the orchestration."
1,no What's With Terry?,"What's with Terry -one of their best songs is not on here. It is the theme song for the great WFMU DJ Terre T. This is an unimaginable slight, and a crying shame. Time for a rerelease, Ryko!!"
5,Totally Impressed!!!!!!!!!,My family of 6 loves this screen house. When we camp we place the picnic table and cooking table inside for weather and insect protection. It survived a terrible storm in the Adirondack Mountains that toppled trees (and sadly killed someone inside their trailer). Our Eureka Titan Tent survived also. We would buy another Eureka product without hesitation.
