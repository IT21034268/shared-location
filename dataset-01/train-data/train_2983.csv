5,The Rebounder,"I really liked this book. The Rebounder really shows how a person feels, when they think they are responsible for a tragic accident. The boy in the story, Chris Patton moved to a new school because of a job change for his dad. Everyone at the school just assumed he was a ball player because of his height and he looks athletic. The coach of the basketball team looks at his background and finds out a few things about Chris. If you are into sports, you would really enjoy this book. The Rebounder really tells a lot about how accidents aren't always your fault and you shouldn't blame yourself for everything, it can really hurt you. This book is very interesting and shows how much people care and are willing to help someone that needs it. I liked how all the friends of Chris helped him through this terrible time for hi, and how Chris `s parents didn't push him to do everything, he made his own choices. I recommend this book to everyone, and I hope you enjoy it as much as I did."
3,"A Good Resource, But...","This is a good resource for parents who want to provide their children with books focusing on the African-American experience. My only complaint is that many of the books recommended (as many as half in the younger age categories) were specifically geared towards the African-American Christian experience. So, non-Christian and secular parents may want to tread carefully."
4,Clever and Charming,"I am a teacher's aide and this book was read to a first grade class. The illustrations are charming, in an old fashioned kind of way. A young boy goes to an auction with his father; because of a troublesome moth the boy winds up bidding on and ultimately winning a lot of useless junk. As his pile adds up he laments about his allowance dwindling. The math is probably (mostly multiplication) a bit above a first grade level, but my class loved the storyline. There is a bit of a surpise ending, and the book ends with an open ending, which led to a quite interesting discussion in the class. I am going to buy this book for my family."
5,great,This shelf is the way to go for sure. It is much stiffer and stronger than the OEM shelf. It has improved ridge support under the front lip and I would not be afraid to put heavy objects on it . It will not crack easily!
5,Super Suite is full of great ideas!,"I bought this book just a few months ago and I loved it! Super Suite has a lot of themes you can choose from. If you like an asian theme, a safari theme, a 'southwest roundup' theme or even a 50's theme for your room, it's all here.The crafts and ideas in this book are not that expensive and can be done no matter what your budget is! One of the most creative and innovative parts of this book is when Mark made a lamp, desk and a memo board using things you can find around the house.This book can be for girls of all ages, hobbies, styles and personalities. It's ideal for girls who want to turn their plain rooms into super suites that express a lot about themselves."
2,Vague.......,"This book is very vague. I liked some points of it but it barely gives any explanation at all. Sure, it shows you how to do most of the things in there, but it doesn't tell you how to convert those ideas into larger rooms. I, personally, have a larger room than most of the rooms in this book. I don't know how this got published, but I guess it did. Also, it doesn't even have any help at picking what's right for you. I've heard of some books having quizzes in the front but this book has nothing. Zero. It does have one good point though- it shows how to actually make the things they show you. That's the only good thing though. Ugh."
5,Nice Collection,"Ultimate Collection is yet another greatest hits album in the Dolly Parton catalogue. 30 tracks of Dolly's hits over her career of 30+ years in country music. The first disc lends itself to many of her country hits, and some duets with Porter Wagoner, while the second disc finds more of Dolly's pop hits. There are a few gems in this collection: Dolly's cover of Great Balls of Fire, and the Holy Roller mix of Peace Train. This is a nice collection that will tide fans over until we are treated to a Dolly box set."
4,Almost perfect.,"This compact disc would have been the best compilation except they didn't include Space Truckin. Still, well worth the price."
3,"No ""SPACE TRUCKIN' "" either?!? I'm goin' 3 1/2 stars now...","I wrote back in March that this set was very good (and it is to a point) but time limitations or no time limitations, any DEEP PURPLE compilation without ""SPACE TRUCKIN'"" is a JOKE. The idea that someone could sit there and say ""Yeah, we'll include *TED THE MECHANIC*(from the ""Perpendicular"" lp) over SPACE TRUCKIN' to represent ""The *VERY BEST* of Deep Purple"" is ridiculous to me. They should've just titled this collection: ""An Overview."" Because without the classic (..really, a *perfect* song that defined 70's hard rock) ""SPACE TRUCKIN'"" this collection CAN NOT be truely be called *The very best of*"
2,Be careful!!!,"I use to use this mascara all the time before it was pulled from the stores and was pleasantly surprised when I saw it offered on Amazon. As usual, the delivery was on time and well-packaged; however, when I pulled the wand out of the tube it was shaped like a corkscrew and looked like it had been jammed in there. The only reason that I gave it two stars was that I know the product is good (when it is not ineffective) and Amazon's costumer service was wonderful. Hopefully it was only a fluke with my unit, but be aware that the problem does exist from the supplier."
5,Quality heater,"So many of the aquarium heaters I've bought for my fish and turtle tanks have been junk and wear out very quickly leaving the heater constantly on. This is both frustrating and dangerous. I use Rena filters on my tanks and find that this company produces the best aquarium products on the market in my opinion. That being said, the shipper sent the two heaters I ordered and one of them didn't work from the start. I am too lazy to send it back. The other one went in my turtle tank and has been working great. Water enters the bottom and exits the top heated -- my guy loves to lay on the output for the warmth!"
5,Top song,This song along with Rockafella Skank would have to be the two best songs i have heard on the radio this year.They stand out from a vast selection of music that is out there for our listening pleasure...Peter
1,ICK!,"awfulawfulawful... don't even think of getting this! ...if you like Gangsta Tripping, you won't like this.. just buy the full album.. the 2 other songs on this are annoy.. long.. and bad.. doesn't sound like like something Norman made.. oh well.. i found it cheap used someplace.. now i know why.. anyone want it?"
4,pretty good,though better living through chemistry is better (his first album.) Its still pretty compared to other techno albums
5,Delighted with this beautiful jam jar!,I was delighted you carry the Royal Albert Old Country Roses collection and when I openned the carefully packed jam jar I was amazed at the quality of this piece. It came in perfect condition and in the time you specified on your notice to me. This piece will be a wonderful addition for a special Lady who has already started her Royal Albert Old Country Roses collection! Thank you for keeping me informed all the way from purchase to receipt. :)
4,Good Taste with a Kick,"I like to chew this gum before workouts and runs. Caffeine takes 30-40 minutes to get into your system, so be sure to take that into account. Two pieces is equivalent to one cup of coffee. The taste is good, but it does fade after half an hour or so. My wife said the gum made her feel ill, but I haven't ever had any side effects."
5,AWESOME AWESOME,"I wish they would go back to selling this at your local Super America stores and Walgreens but they dont. Sad because it works wonders, unfortunately, my kids say i'm addicted. So needless to say, i hope amazon never runs out. i chewed it years ago and then found it at a little rinky dink store by my new home, bought it all, they ordered it just for me and sold it at 1.79 a pack, well needless to say once again they couldnt get it so i found it on amazon, so all you people out there that love it save some for me, i know get it shipped monthly!!!! Yippie for jolt gum!!!"
2,Good taste,"I've bought this gum several times and it does have a good taste. There is a little aftertaste to it, but nothing bad. I only gave it two stars because I just didn't feel like I was on a coffee high. Doesn't even come close to coffee. Tastes good though and it can't hurt to try it. Why am I doing a review on gum anyway? Bored!"
3,It's Caffeinated Chewing Gum,"It's expected to taste weird, but I found it to taste really awful. The spearmint makes it worse, almost accenting the bitterness. Cinnamon would've made it slightly better. I don't think mint would cut down on the caffeine additives taste. However, two pieces works like a good cup of coffee. There isn't much of a crash afterward, either."
5,Important Info!,"This gun is not full metal, but have some metal parts like the safety, hammer, barrel, and trigger. This isn't all accurate to the real M9 but a real close replica. The safety is the slide lock part. There isn't no slide lock. The real safety is just a molded detail. I really like this gun and it's great for beginners."
1,sucks,"so i got this gun right, and it shot well until about 3 weeks after i got it, i take it out after about a week of not using it and i go to shoot it and the hammer part on the back gets jammed EVERY TIME, but when i push it foward, then it shoots, lamee!! and i also did see a hair in there when i got it, maybe that was the problem, but idk, all i know is that this gun was good for a couple days, then it broke, really cheap gun!"
4,If you liked Mixed Nut's try No Apologies,"The Skunks beautiful, seemingly synthetic sound takes a different turn from Mixed Nuts... In No Apologies, The Skunks create a flavor that will keep you skanking all night long... The album is quick moving with that familiar sound reminiscent of the Specials and Madness... their cover of Simmer Down midway through the album brings this album even closer to home. I suggest No Apologies to any Rudi looking to enhance their collection."
5,A Treasure Indeed,"This DVD is packed with hours of some of the best animation ever made! Sound and visual quality is top notch. As my kids can attest, you'll want to watch it over and over again. Better hurry, as a limited edition, this DVD will not last long."
3,No Farmyard Symphony,"I bought this for a number of Silly Symphonies. I expected this and More Silly Symphonies to be my one stop shop for all of the silly symphonies I use. But it's not. Despite it stating so in the insert, there is no Farmyard Symphony on disc two under any of the titles, let alone where it is supposed to be under Accent on Music.This is extremely disappointing. I had to purchase Make Mine Music to get it and I have to sit through 4 min. of advertising at the beginning every time I put the disc in the DVD player. This is unacceptable in a classroom situation.I figured by purchasing both Silly Symphonies and More Silly Symphonies I'd have them all. Not so. And the one I want not on either of them.Boo, hiss."
3,missing Treasures!!!!,"Whilst this is a lovely compilation of the Silly Symphonies series, there are many missing treasures, such as ""Broken Toys"", ""Moth and the Flame"" ""Spring"", ""The Goddess of Spring"" ""Midnight in a Toyshop"" ""Autumn"" etc. Out of the 70+ Silly Symphonies realeased, this DVD only holds a fraction!!!!!!!!!!!! I hope Disney releases the rest in another DVD! It's rather disappointing to have only a fraction of one's childhood ""deemed worthy of releasing""!!"
4,Great cartoons - lots of mistakes though,The cartoons are great - although I'm not sure why they didn't release a complete collection of the Silly Symphonies. The printed booklet that comes with the set is highly inaccurate - there are quite a few more cartoons listed than actually appear on the DVDs. Hard to believe a company like Disney would make such a huge blunder. The packaging is cool visually but pretty useless. The organization of the cartoons on the DVDs and play options are very lame - not well thought out at all. Again - hard to believe a company with the resources that Disney has could make such a huge blunder. Worth getting for the cartoons but I hope they will correct the errors on this set of DVDs and release another set of DVDs with all of the Silly Symphonies on them.
5,What a Treasure!,"I can't possibly describe the awe that I feel while watching this DVD treasure of Disney's finest from the early years of animation. You get exactly what you expect and more. Just the two cartoons ""Skeleton Dance"" and ""The Old Mill"" are worth the cost. But even my young children love the colorful characters in these delightful cartoon shorts. The loveable three little pigs come to life as well as the tortoise and the hare, Mother Hen,(with a delightful appearance by a very early Donald Duck), and it even has some great surprises that you don't expect if you use your remote and find the Easter Eggs hidden throughout the DVD.This DVD has more than you may expect and is worth every penny, particularly if you love these old Disney shorts. Thank you, Walt, for your contribution to the entertainment industry."
3,classics,"I grew up with these classic short cartoons from Disney. So, I absolutely loved it when I discovered that could include it in my collection. The items arrived quickly, a lot sooner than I expected. However, the collectible art work is not in. :( Other than that, the content's definitely worth every star there!"
4,Silly Symphonies,"Thoroughly enjoyable vintage Disney. However, advertising in the product information included the episode ""Water Babies"", which was the reason I ordered the DVD. This episode was NOT included and I could not find it anywere on the menu, nor on the DVDs (both disc 1 & 2)when played right through. Disappointed that Water Babies was not on the DVD, but really enjoyed the rest as well."
4,Pretty good way to educate your kids!,"I bought this dvd to entertain a little girl i know, and she absolutely loves it!"
5,great old treasures,"i got this for my grandaughters. my oldest one, 4, used to love the old tape i had with the three little pigs, but when that broke i thought i was out of luck forever until i saw this. now they have new favorites, in particular babes in the woods and the skeleton dance. it is a great little set, a little pricey, but it will be a classic forever."
4,The Platinum Group of Silly Symphonies,"If you've seen any of Disney's video compilations from the 1980s, then you've seen these cartoons. That doesn't mean that they're bad. Honestly, all of these cartoons represent the best of the Silly Symphony franchise presented in bright, restored colors.I'm a Super Disney Cartoon Fan, however, so I expected a completest package along the lines of the Mickey Mouse sets and the Goofy set. I was looking to get a glimpse at many of the more obscure cartoons in the series that are rarely shown anymore (except maybe early in the morning on the Disney Channel).Good set, though, that I would highly recommend.I hope a Volume 2 is forthcoming that will fill in the remaining cartoons."
5,Another gem,"Disney truly stands the test of time. Even in this age of CGI the talent and spirit that went into these films shines through... It includes behind the scene looks into the process that went into creating these masterpieces. Not only entertaining, but informative as well."
4,nothing's missing,"If you wonder why is the list of cartoons on the booklet is different from the list on screen, I don't know why but I did find ""missing"" cartoons with help of my computer. I looked at all contents of the disc and found them. I don't how to access The Practical Pig from the menu, but it's there. Also there are at least 5 (!) hidden features on Disc One. I looked through Disc One so far. You can access these ""easter eggs"" by highlighting various objects on the screen. (for example: word ""Leonrd"", a little sword, little angel etc.) This is a very beautiful DVD and has a lot of intersting cartoons, but it's so hard to find ones you want! Why did Disney do that?"
1,Total crap!!!!,I washed this thing once and it almost totally fell apart! I have other russell items and they are much better quality! Very disappointed in this product. Amazon rules though got my package right away.
1,THIS IS NOT A PAINT KIT,"Despite the product name and image this is NOT a paint kit and does not contain any paint. It is just a drop cloth, brushes and an exacto knife. Same product is $3.50 at large department stores. Amazon, please have your market place sellers provide appropriate descriptions and images."
3,Wrong Image,"The imageTestors Hobby Supplies Paint Kitdoes not match the product. It shows you will receive paint, but you do not. You receive model building supplies."
4,Model Building Supplies Kit,Model Building Supplies Kit . Simmple kit and quality. . . . . . . . . . . .
3,It ok for what you pay,This item is about what you would expect for the price you pay. The knife gets dull pretty fast and the brushes were almost worthless on any detail job. the only thing i can use them for is the under coat on large surfaces.
3,Good Set,"Was using the exacto-knife for taking excess plastic off of model pieces and the tip already broke. Wasn't even using a lot of force to clean off excess plastic so I was shocked it broke off. If the knife gets dull, I'd have to buy another one instead of just changing the blade itself. Everything else was great for putting together my models."
1,Not Family Friendly,"We were very disappointed in this movie and wonder why is it not rated yet. For family friendly we give it an F. We were astonished and chagrined by the quite unnecessary and free use of profanity, and would not have purchased it if we had known. There were more than 6 infractions...one (1) should disqualify a film from the Family Friendly, clean, etc, group. So sad that they (like many producers) choose to ruin what could be a good story by adding profanity. No, ""everybody"" does not talk that way!"
4,Great family film,"I saw Gentle Ben on the Animal Planet one night 3 or 4 years ago and was happy to know that they had made a second one. The movie has good, clean, wholesome values that I like my kids to see good examples of. It is also an interesting, fun movie that my kids like watching. (My 17 year old son watched it with me). If you haven't gotten Gentle Ben 1, I would recommend buying and watching it first because this one continues where that one left off."
4,Handy organizer,This organizer is most helpful in providing a place for all of the small stuff that otherwise forever seems to float around and get lost. Screws provided were useless.
4,Good Organizer,"It fits in my 1990 F150. Holds three levels and many tools, maps, etc... We shall see about its longevity."
5,Indispensible accessory,"I have recently bought my third pickup and one of the first improvements I made was to buy one of these organizers, just as I had for the other two trucks. I can't imagine trying to get along without one."
3,"Good, but not good enough","I purchased the RiteLite with the intention of using it in a show booth to illuminate my photographs. I was attracted to the product because it ran on batteries instead of AC power. LED's gave it had a long battery life. I confirmed this by leaving it on for over 5 straight hours. It can definitely be left on for much longer without changing batteries.The gooseneck and tilting light head are great features but inadequate. The gooseneck is too short and/or the head does not tilt enough. With the light on, you can see the lit LED's because there is no front shield. This shouldn't be the case with a true picture light as it distracts from the image. At least the beam is somewhat focused so light didn't spill too much towards the viewer. A front shield/reflector would make this a better product because, despite 6 LED's, the light could not cover a 16x24 area.In end I didn't use this light and wouldn't recommend it for artwork much larger than an 8x10 (not including the frame)."
5,A fascinating biographical and spiritual account which readers will enjoy year-round,"Nicholas: The Epic Journey From Saint To Santa Claus arrived too late for more timely holiday mention but still provides a fascinating biographical and spiritual account which readers will enjoy year-round. The rise of Santa Claus from his origins in Byzantine Turkey to his modern jolly friend of children image is followed in a survey of religious worship and changes around the world. The author's own travelogue in search of Nicholas' spirit and bones makes for a passionate, lively study."
3,Saint Nicholas' Travels in Becoming Santa Claus,"My husband and I listened to an intriguing abridgement of this book on BBC Radio 4X last Christmas, intriguing enough for me to hunt down a copy. Seal investigates the reality and the myth of St. Nicholas, from his shadowed origins to the miraculous ""blood"" which comes fro his tomb and the theft of his body and its transport to Bari in Italy in medieval times. Seal travels to each of the places in the St. Nicholas legend, leading to some picturesque visits to Turkey and small towns around the Mediterranean, and then to Amsterdam and Belgium. It's an interesting, if occasionally dry, narrative except for Seal's insistence on writing Nicholas' story as if the deceased saint was somehow directing his fame from beyond the grave. Seal sets this against the search of his own children for ""the real Santa Claus,"" for which the family finally takes a trip to Finland. Unusual and offbeat, but worth looking up if you have an interest in the ""ancestry"" of Santa."
1,Please don't purchase this machine!!,"Our school has the same one; it is very hard to load film on the machine. GBC manufactures better large Laminators now. Don't buy GBC Ultima 65. You will regret whenever the two rolls of film need to be changed. You cannot even find an instructional video of loading the film on Youtube, and the manual was written very poorly."
1,Won't install,The software won't install. Then they wanted to charge me an extra $50 dollars to make it work. Bad customer service for a questionable product anyway. Avoid.
2,Not Compatible,I bought this product of the eyeq site for a sale price of $200. I received it in the mail days later and it would not work on my computer. I have a hp envy 14 that runs windows 7. I called the customer line and we uninstalled and re-installed including the tages download and the program still did not work. I'm in the process of sending it back now.
1,rip-off with drivers for Windows Vista,"I bought the software two-or-so years ago. Expensive, somewhat helpful. Recently I tried to load it on my new laptop with Windows Vista. It does not work. Contacted their support. After wasting an hour of my time, the totally unprofessional rep finally informed me that they would not give me drivers for Vista. They can send me the upgrade for [............]. Sounds like a scam to me (I didn't take the deal)."
3,it's ok,"EyeQ is alright - only 7 or so minutes is required a day for limited time because the techniques to read faster are simple.My reading speed does seem to increase about 20%I wouldn't want to pay full price for this but try picking it up on ebay for about the quarter of the price if you're interested (i did).Finally the negative reviews here seem to be problems with compatibility - so aren't really being fair on the actual program. I testify it working fine on windows 7One last thing, another quality speed reading program i'm looking into is reading genius 2.0 - my research so far suggests people are liking it better than eyeQ - considering purchasing it tooa bit expensive"
2,poor support,"I purchased the mac version of this in 2011 and 6 months later IQ stopped working when I did a upgrade to a newer os version. Eyeqs policy for this is sorry, too bad. I had to purchase the online version of this ($99) to continue using the program. The online version only let me login for a year before it expired. This despite having paid $300 for the delux mac version.Eyeq works great IF you continue to use it. My WPM jumped from 400 to 1500-2000 while I was doing the lessons and exercises regularly. However I noticed that after 6 months of not using it and logging back in, my reading rate had dropped back down to the original 400.I would strongly suggest not purchasing the online version if you want to retain your gains and instead getting one for windows and hoping it continues to work and be supported."
5,Fantastic SCI-FI at its Best!!,"Great episode! The actor that plays the Marshal does a fantastic job. AT least I hope he was acting, he was very convincing as a meglomaniac. A rather long 6 part story that never lags. The production levels were fairly high for this episode condsidering when it was made. Jo was a good companion that woeked well with Jon Pertwee's Doctor.All in all, great acting all throughout with excellent sound effects and an interesting plot."
3,Average Pertwee Entry,"I consider Jon Pertwee to be my favorite Doctor of all time. Easily the most physical of all the Doctors and could charm the pants off anyone (IMO) The seventies was without a doubt the golden era of Doctor Who. As for the story itself, it is quite interesting with a powerful message. I think the drawback though was in the execution. I would not rate this in the top 10 of Pertwee stories, but its nice to have if you are looking just to add to your dvd collection."
5,Great of Doctor Who episode,This is a great old Doctor Who episode that isn't available on DVD at the time of this post. This is a must see episode to understand this doctor.
4,June Cleaver they ain't,"Mr.Rothe has lovingly put together the photographs of burlesque stars and forgotten performers that would have appeared in publicity packages, coming attractions posters,lobby cards, and advertisments fifty years ago. Not all of the women are conventionally beautiful, and their costumes would be considered less than risque by current standards. These are women that time and mainstream history have ignored.The exsistence of their images is important: for feminists, for people interested in the history of costume, for modern consumers of sex work, for those that think of Doris Day as being the penultimate 1950's woman. Enjoy this piece of work and contemplate where these lovely ladies are now..."
4,"Cute Pictures, Minimal Text","It's implied in the book's title, and as a pictorial essay this is a really cute book. The pictures are a good quality and there is good variety."
4,Sizzle !!!!,"Fantastic Coffee Table book , a short intro and onto the girls who are just stunning.This is also a 'in your face book' to the current main stream fashion industry who has forgotten the diversity the female body can offer as a feast for the eyes in all shapes colours and sizes.For aspiring Burlesque models and dancers there is loads of inspiration.Lost 1 star because Betty Page, Mamie Van Doren and Betty Brosmer are not in this book."
1,Really ticked off,"Hollywood Pictures Home Video held me hostage for ten minutes after inserting The Sixth Sense into my DVD Player. I was unable to fast-forward past the previews and the menu button was disabled. I am really ticked off that, after paying for this movie, the author of this DVD insists on wasting ten minutes of my life every time I watch this movie to force me to watch their movie previews over and over again. Life is too short. If I am forced to watch ten minutes of commercials everytime I play this DVD, then the DVD should have been given to me for free. I paid money to own this video so I can watch it on my own time and at my convenience. I refuse to own any movie which sucks my life away from me, even ten minutes of it. Life is too short. Do not buy this release. (btw - I liked the movie)"
3,PRIMarily Lean on Job Shop,"This book lives up to its Primer status. It does a great job of covering the basics of lean. What it doesn't do well is provide solutions for JOB SHOPS. If you are looking for a book to assist in implementing lean in a custom manufacturing shop, this book does not fit the bill--despite its title. If you want to learn the very basics about lean, then definitely order this book."
2,"This time, KISS delivered nothing but FALSE ADVERTISING!","This DVD is based off the web series KISS Immortals. Did someone forget to include the remaining 2/3 of the story on the DVD? Imagine going to the movie theater to see the hottest release, and having it cut off just when the action starts. I'm extremely dissapointed in this Product. It overpromises and underdelivers. I'm not even sure why any retailer in their right mind would carry this mockery. My advice to you is: Don't buy it! You will be extremely dissapointed."
2,SAVE YOUR MONEY!!!,"After eagerly awaiting the DVD release of KISS Immortals, I was extremely disappointed to realize that only 9 of the 27 Webisodes are on the DVD! Not only that, the DVD will not skip ahead chapters and trying to fast forward reacts in a funny way too. Being a KISS fan from 1974, and viewing and saving all the webisodes from Bright Digital Entertainment, This DVD was truly disheartening to say the least. If the producers don't come out with the follow up DVD's to complete the story, then seriously save your hard earned cash and don't buy this one.You've been warned!"
4,Great intro into 3rd wave ska!,This little known compilation was one of the best showings of 3rd wave ska in the 90's. It possesses a smorgasboard of stylized music from the los hooligans to the aquabats. If you have ever considered listening to ska and didn't know where to start this would be an excellent first step.
1,DVD would not play,"This DVD would not play. I tried two players, including one that is not region-restricted, and all it would do is make a spinning sound, but would not load or play. Since another customer had problems and has requested a replacement, I am giving this product a 1-star rating. While the content may be very good, as reported by others, I recommend not purchasing this DVD unless the Amazon description notes that production problems have been corrected."
1,Too soft,"I was very disappointed with this DVD. It shows a concert from Buenos Aires with a large orchestra playing many of the old classic tangos. On one track a couple dances ""ballet""-tango. The concert and the music is smooth and ""very nice"" - and that's my problem with the DVD. Although there are some fine performances by single musicians (one of them being the lead bandoneon player), in my opinion, overall it doesn't rise above the level of supermarket music. If you buy a DVD with a Piazzolla concert - played by the master himself - and listen to a minute of it, you'll get much more intensity, music, and feeling than on this entire DVD. I'm sorry for the bad review, generally I like to support the effort of musicians, but I feel I have wasted my money on this one. I didn't have any technical problems with the DVD."
3,"Learn from Andy Aledort, not Wolf Marshall",Wolf Marshall does'nt do the most accurate transcriptions. Some songs in this book like Voodoo Chile were really lacking (the cd track sounded like a real amature playing the intro). I bought this book to learn all those little things that really make up SRV's playing style. You won't learn this stuff in this book. About all you will get out of this book is some decent transcriptions and some info on how to play them. Please do yourself a favor and check out anything written by Andy Aledort. He seems to really get into the stuff he writes about and teaches. I bought his book which breaks down some good Hendrix stuff. Money very well spent.
3,ok but bot amazing,"the product arrived promptly and was packaged well, but they did not seem to work for me no matter how tight i could get it water still got in."
3,"A definite ""insiders"" tale...","I'd really like to give this 3 1/2 stars (not quite 4 stars). This book is not for the average history reader...you will be confused and sometimes mis-led as you slog through these transcripts. The saving grace for this book is the authors' interjections at the beginning and end of each chapter to kind of summarize what just transpired (...a complete sentence is a rarity here...just what you'd expect from real time transcripts). Also, the Introduction and Conclusion sections are classic history telling and made me wish that the authors would write their own story of the ""Crisis"". Overall, worthwile for the Cuban Missile Crisis buff, but be prepared for slow reading."
5,Well done...,"Having lived through the Missile Crisis, I can recall the terror of my parents stocking up on food and preparing a ""safe"" place in the house with aluminum foil on the walls. Little did I know then, and have come to learn through disclosures such as this book, that they had just cause for alarm. This book explores, in contextual detail, the terrifying details that were withheld from the general public from the actual possible activation of missiles to the refusal of the Soviets to comply with the blockade.I highly recommend this book to anyone who lived through this era to ""fill in the gaps"" of our knowledge."
2,An Inferior Product. The Product of Comfortable Scholarship.,"Averting The Final Failure by Sheldon Stern is a far superior book. It is also based on the Excom tapes. The author discusses several glaring mistakes made by May and Zelikow.

4,"Great Movie, Good Hi Def","This is a review of the hd-dvd. This is an overall great movie but I think the filming techniques used (almost a whitewash in most of the film) lend this to be a visually interesting movie but not the greatest example of hd-dvd quality out there! I recommend this version over the sd the picture quality is obviously better and the audio is excellent in your HT set up! over all a great product and addition to your hd library, just not a premiere showpiece like Serenity or The Searchers!! Happy Hi Def all!!"
3,Review of Letters from Iwo Jima,We did not realize that this film was entirely in Japanese and had a hard time reading the words in English fast enuf and the words were not always clear. We ended up giving it to a Japanese friend.
4,Pretty good but not rivoting,"Enjoyable. Even my wife watched through the entire movie - subtitles and all. I thought one seen was somewhat bashing to the Marine Corp but it could be true. I think the Japanese soldiers were far more finatical than portrayed in the movie - according to stories my uncle told me. Yep, he was there to know in person.Overall a good movie."
3,Unique prospective....,"This movie is different from many others, it does not glorify war.You really get to see the story of many of the Japanese who fought and died defending those islands, and ther perspective was very interesting and unique. I rated this movie 3 stars for a few simple reasons: most of the dialogue it's in japanese, this makes it hard to follow and get involved. Also I felt that the portrail of the Japanese soldiers was maybe too sympathetic. I heard from my father who actually was there, that they were far more fanatical than portrayed."
3,Why All The Fuss?,"The only reason anyone even gave this movie a glance is because Clint made it, otherwise it would have dropped off the radar. Although there were some intriguing moments of fine acting, for me, the movie did not hang well together as a whole. The dialogue was stilted and the filming and direction seemed fractured. This felt more like a play about war, than a war movie. It was very quiet. Very monochromatic. Quite dull."
3,Interesting point of view,"We very rarely see a movie that portrays what goes on behind enemy lines. To us, Japan was the enemy, and to Japan, vice versa, so it was sort of interesting to watch the happenings on the other side of things. That said, the movie itself is somewhat on the bland side, especially the first half. Truly not much happened, it was all just a waiting game. When the battles actually begin, it is very intense and graphic. Especially the suicide scenes. Very poignant and true. The acting was very solid throughout. The only gripe I have is with the subtitles. They were somewhat hard to read in certain scenes. Either they were not on the screen long enough, or they were just hard to make out in contrast with the scene background. I do not mind reading subtitles, I just wish they stood out a little better in this film. I don't know how much of this film is historically accurate, but that is difficult to achieve with any war film. But this one is certainly worth watching."
5,LETTERS FROM IWO JIMA,AWESOME DVD. GREAT SHAPE FAST DELIVERY AWESOME MOVIE. CLINT EASTWOOD IS JUST A GREAT DIRECTOR AND ACTOR AND I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS MOVIE TO ANYONE.
3,Could have had stronger content,"This attempted to show a more personal side to the actual battle, I think it did ok given the amount of crew/actors involved."
4,Good Historical Movie,This movie is good and you even hold sympathy for the Japenese at times. Its well acted and gets you into the world war 2 theme (pacific theater). The only problem is the subtitles. The subtitles are small and you pay more attention at the subtitles than the actual movie. I know it's in Japenese and that the only way to understand the movie but they should of put the subtitles a bit bigger. Other than that this movie is great.
3,all quiet on the eastern front,"the second part of clint eastwoods paean to the legendary ww2 battle came out to intense praise from critics last year, and while its a perfectly good war movie, im at a loss to understand where its supposed to be great. is it that this tells the tale from the ""enemy"" point of view? well, i can go back as far as ""all quiet on the western front"" at least for a similar concept. yes, war is horrid and the enemy is not so very different from us: i have seen it before. good battle sequences, good acting, good movie -- but a masterpiece? no."
1,Letters from Iwo Jima,"This product was not what I expected, I expected the english version not the Japanese version. I do want a refund for the product...."
1,LETTERS from IWO JIMA Blue-ray DVD,"I try to purchase all movies Clint Eastwood has any thing to do with. The problem with this movie is I do not speak nor do I understand Japanese. I feel AMAZON.COM should have printed in large type along with the movie advertisement that the dialog for this movie is all spoken in Japanese. Therefore for my use this production rates ZERO stars, but you force me to pick at least one star in order to submit my comments.PS - I notice one of your criteria for submitting a review is ""are you over 13?"" I am 72."
1,Anti-American and BORING,"If you hate America, and ignore history, this is the movie for you. First of all, the movie was extremely boring, mostly dialog (in Japanese with sub-titles), very little war action. As the movie progresses, you see that it is really a thinly veiled attack on America, and on war in general.The movie takes a huge left turn, exemplified by two scenes. In the first, the Japanese are shown to risk their own lives to run into enemy fire to recover a wounded US soldier, then they treat him with the last of their morphine. This is in contrast to the scene showing a US soldier shooting 2 unarmed, captured POW's who surrendered so the Americans would give them a meal.Clint Eastwood must have lost his mind if he thinks my grandfater and his brothers in arms EVER shot an unarmed POW.Please avoid this movie."
2,this the-other-side-in-the-pacific-ocean movie actually sucks big time!,"and it bored me to death by watching it. and there were lot of movies about the second world war, but this movie unfortunately carried the most boring and dead-beat storyline. while 'flag of our fathers' was full of hollow parties and big words, 'letters from iwo jima' was even worse, not just boring, but subtly insert a message to let you see how cruel and abusive the japanese high ranking officers were to their subordinate soldiers. there almost nothing worth to be seen in this hollow and boring movie. i just have to say that both the 'flag' and the 'letters' sucked big time. they were two of the worst movies in my viewing experience, and they didn't even deserve my time to write reviews, because it's simply dumb after i've already wasted almost over 5 hours sitting through them."
4,Movie Review,Enjoyed the film. Not many American Directors/Producers have the courage to present the view point of an opposing side especially in a war as unpopular as the Japanese were during WWII. It is also difficult to get English speaking audiences to watch a movie with subtitles. Multitasking must be tough for many of us.
5,Its clint eastwood,"This movie deserves every award it recieved and more. Clint eastwood is able to bring a perspective of WWII that many others have tried but in a spectacular way. Covering many things that happened and even showing you the family side of japanese life during the war. This movie will open your eyes, and teach you things you never thought you would learn."
3,WERE THE JAPANESE REALLY THIS STUPID?,"I don't know if it's because it was directed by an American, but I saw a grand total of about 5 Americans die in this move, and about 5000 Japanese die.The Japanese did not use their defensive advantage at all. They gave it up time and time again.Their petty infighting, and willingness to kill themselves rather than THE ENEMY seems to have been their biggest reason for their defeat.The movie pissed me off the whole way through."
2,The brutality and fanatisism of the Japanese forces was not represented,"I watched this movie a short while after I had watched HBO's mini-series ""The Pacific"". Both the mini-series and the included supplementary interviews with American veterans amply documented the fanatical, inhuman brutality that the Japanese forces exhibited throughout the war.I'll bet every one of those veterans would bristle at the touchy-feely treatment given to the main characters in this film. While there may have been a few Japanese soldiers that acted with what we would consider humane and human reactions to conflict, this movie did a dis-service to history by not also explicitly documenting the maniacal attitude most of the Japanese were imbued with and the resulting atrocities they committed, both to the living and the dead."
3,Hoakum still rules Clint.,"The bit with Baron Nishi bringing his favorite horse to Iwo which is then killed in an American air raid,is shameless hoakum. Baron Nishi took ship to Iwo which was sunk on the way, with the loss of all his tanks. It's said he did carry a riding crop and wear his calvary boots while at Iwo. His horse was never at Iwo.The letters supposedly discovered buried at Iwo has all been available to historians and interested parties for decades.The so called music score is a sorry thing, without inspiration or relevence.But setting these and other Hollwoodisms aside, it's watchable...."
2,nothing special,"I was intrigued to watch this, as seeing a movie about the Battle of Iwo Jima from the Japanese perspective seemed promising.Alas! I don't feel the director or the scriptwriter had any insights into that battle, into the the lives of their characters, or into the mind of the Japanese that anybody else doesn't. It was all so stereotypical.Plus: couldn't tell the characters apart, as they all look the same and Eastwood does nothing about this. The guy who was taken from his wife? I thought he died like 3 times! Was he the guy with the shovel at the end? (Before branding me a racist, bear in mind I had the same complaint about the companion movie, ""Flags of Our Fathers."")"
3,Too bad I don't read fast!,"This is a terrific product, IF you speak Japanese or have the ability to speed read. I purchased this item because the advertised spoken language was English or Japanese. Unfortunately, that is not the case. The spoken language is Japanese with English subtitles. A real shame, because I think hearing the profound dialog that I did have time to read would be worth hearing in English."
2,WHO KNEW THE JAPANESE WERE SO SWEET!,Eastwood had to wait till most of the World War 2 vets were dead before he could make this movie. The vets likely had no idea their Japanese adversaries were so sweet and considerate. Maybe Clint will rehab the Nazi SS next.Otherwise the movie is an introspective navel-gazing pity party.
5,The best American made movie about Japan,"As a Japanese, I was very much disappointed by Hollywood movies about Japan in the past. They were always somewhat weird. For this reason, at first, I was skeptical about the quality of an American made movie from the Japanese perspective. But I was wrong. Letters From Iwo Jima (""Iwo Jima"" means ""Sulfur Island"") is pretty much accurate about Japanese people's mind and its history. This movie depicts each person's character very carefully, in a hopeless situation. If you'd like to catch a glimpse of life in Japan toward the end of World War II, this film is also the one."
5,Could be Eastwood's best work to date...,"This is not a war film that will be accessible to every viewer, especially those who are only used to soaking up the typical American propaganda war films of the past half century. Of course there are going to be those right winged/ 'wannabe pushovers' who will automatically be persuaded to call out this film as: ""rewriting history,"" when, in reality, they have NO clue/ concept of what actually occurred during this part of history from the POV of the Japanese soldiers, (and still consider any ""enemy"" to the US as nothing more than ""savages."") The fact of the matter is, the film is a true masterpiece of artistic cinema. Many people seem to forget the notion that film = art. ""Letters"" is NOT a documentary film; it is a filmic portrait of a generally unknown/misunderstood piece of modern history. I would say this subtle masterpiece is Eastwood's best work to date. Though I am sure there are those who would disagree."
3,An uncomfortable blend of Japanese stoicism and American sentiment,"""Letters from Iwo Jima"" tells the story of the American attack on the tiny island of Iwo Jima during WWII from the perspective of its Japanese defenders.This film, although although OK on its own terms, suffers in comparison to the ""other"" Iwo Jima movie that director Clint Eastwood filmed at the same time - the excellent ""Flags of our Fathers"", which tells the story from the American perspective.Eastwood is less comfortable telling this story and it ends up being an uncomfortable mixture of Japanese stoicism and American sentiment, which as not as moving as it would like to be.Given the dearth of WWII films from the Japanese perspective, this film tries to make up for it by packing in so many characters and subplots it eventually becomes wearisome.The performances are all excellent especially Ken Watanabe as the Japanese commander - General Tadamichi Kuribayashi - but Eastwood misses the bullseye with this one."
3,It was okay but not as good as I thought it would be,"No one can deny that Clint Eastwood is a good filmaker. But all of his films are so dark (literally and figuratevly) that it kind of bores me. LfIG was no different. It was an ""inspirational"" film that did make you think and makes a good discussion to have with your father, but I found it way too slow. It was relatively long and they were in a cave most of the time. It was okay but in the end, I say it was too long and boring. But good acting and writing and directing"
2,"Interesting viewpoint sullied by ""Redacted""-style anti-Americanism","I don't object to an alternative point of view on the Battle of Iwo Jima. American students of the War in the Pacific respect the Japanese soldier's martial spirit in general and the Japanese on Iwo Jima in particular. What's objectionable is the portrayal of U.S. soldiers casually shooting prisoners of war. Did such a thing happen in the War in the Pacific? I'm sure it did, but there's no record of it happening during the battle of Iwo Jima, and it's a distortion to include that scene, which is hypothetical in this case and is given a prominent place in the movie's plot.* In a small way it's like De Palma's ""Redacted"": based on some truth but leaving out so much context that it becomes a de facto lie. Shame on you Clint! Shame!* Do people judge FDR prominently on his treatment of Japanese-Americans during the War?"
1,American Heros Desecration,"This film was a very clever idea and I enjoyed the premise until they introduced the American characters. Then, I was outraged!!! It is one thing to try to humanize the war and human sacrifices a war entails. It is completely shameful to humanize a brutal enemy who massacred Millions of Chinese a short time before, and then proceeded to try to spread that brutality to American Soil! Japanese, who thought it was more honorable to kill their men through suicide then to suffer a loss. If you want to humanize that, I can go a long with the premise. But, to de-humanize our American Heroes as nothing more then brutal, uncaring, beasts? It is intolerable!! Clint Eastwood ought to be ashamed, but that is the legacy of our HEROS, he has the liberty that the Japanese so wanted to take away. The lessons of History, we can't forget; generation to generation this is our debt! I did not watch the end..."
1,blu ray letters from iwo jima,terrible copy....have an earlier copy in HD...which puts this one to shame...lousy copy...threw it into the trash...
1,Letters from IwoJima,"Not really that happy with the dvd. I have a new small flat screen hd tv and was not able to play the dvd as the format was not the same. not sure why as the t v i had was new. I am sorry i bought the movie, was not in english and the words on the screen were to low to read so didnt understand most of the movie.I have not tried it yet on my large hd tv"
1,Iwo Jima,Did not realize that it was all subtitles. Very difficult for elderly to keep up with the conversations. He lost interest in just a few minutes and wouldn't watch the remaining movie.
5,A Fantastic movie...,"...and a fantastic companion piece to ""Flags of our Fathers"". I actually think it's the better film between the two.On the surface, attempting to let U.S. audiences see the battle of Iwo Jima from the perspective of the Japanese could be a tricky endeavor.But the director (and English dialog) quickly immerse you in the period, the patriotism and the palpable taste of the war. These guys know they are on a hopeless mission, but their never-ending pride for country keeps them going, and keeps you hooked.This movie is much more engaging than ""Flags of our Fathers"". From the beginning, you quickly start to understand the relationship between the characters, and it lures you in.My favorite crossroads in this movie is when the Japanese troops spy the American soldiers raising the flag at Mount Suribachi. This provides the clearest reference point to ""Flags of our Fathers"".All in all, an engaging movie that deserves to be seen in Blu-Ray HD.5 stars"
5,Best I've ever seen,Watch this - you'll get a perspective you never knew about.... maybe will change your way of thinking? Our hero Mr Eastwood-son has not only created the best WWII movie ever made but shows it from the enemy's perspective! If this doesn't win EVERY award - something's wrong! This is a MUST SEE movie.
4,letters to the present,"A well acted movie, also one of the most affecting films I've seen in quite a time. It left me quite depressed for a while. In a way it mirrors the times we are living in with our older generation's fatalistic view of the future.You know the ending - the Americans win the battle with very, very high casualties, but that is overshadowed by the 90 - 95% death rate for the Japanese defenders.Just as the Japanese leadership on Iwo Jima believed that the only thing they could do was give hell to the invaders and then die, it seems like many of the older generation now feel there is nothing that can be done to change anything and are just waiting for the apocalypse.But there is hope in the younger generation who believe a united, prosperous and peaceful planet is possible and want to live in it, and are well represented in the film by the young Japanese recruit, Saigo."
4,A Quick Review of Letters from Iwo Jima,"This movie is about letters discovered on the island of Iwo Jima 60 years after the war. The movie (filmed on location) focuses on what was written on those letters. This movie shows the gruesome reality of the battle of Iwo Jima as shown through the eyes of the Japanese soldiers. This Clint Eastwood directed movie is entirely in Japanese with subtitles (winner of the Golden Globe Award). At times, the film seems a bit longer than what is necessary, but overall, a magnificent film."
5,"Scofflaws ""Hi-Fi"" a classic!","I'm still impressed and enthusiastic about this rare and tasty, masterful recording. I've introduced several friends to Ska music, and this work is accessible to a variety of listening tastes.My daughter, who is ten, absolutely loves it, and that, I find, is quite amazing for a girl who otherwise listens to 98 degrees, Backstreet Boys, and Will Smith."
3,Choose Your Pleasure,Choose Your Own Nightmare: Night Of The Werewolf is not a kindly well designed movie however it worth to watch.The special effects looked poor to me not very well besides the sound and the music is not so strong.It is your choice to buy or not to buy it.I can not tell anything clearly about this movie.
1,"Don't do drugs, you might end up like this","It has to be tough being Motley Crue, well into middle age, and you've blown all your money on booze, smack, blow, and strippers. Now nobody buys your cds, because your music didn't age well (unlike Guns N' Roses). Sorry guys"
4,Fun ideas for family games,Easy to read book of games. I liked how they divided it up into types and also suggested number of players and ages for each game.
1,Not what I expected,"I ordered this product as a Christmas present to go along with personalized cards I ordered for my brother-in-law. I wanted a general card game book to give him a place to start. This book did not have the basics! No spades, no spite & malice, no canasta... what the heck? Returned it right away. Did not find a replacement that I can recommend."
1,Not worth the money,"Consumers do not make the same mistake I did and purchase this nightlight. I'm not sure what the ""swinging"" part of the light is. I was assuming it would rotate around in a circle, but instead it just falls apart. It is very cheap made plastic. I think I could have gotten more for my money at the Dollar Tree. It came with no instructions for the clear piece of plastic that came w/it. The light is very dim and the Batman picture doesn't even stay in it. It just falls apart in my hands. Very disappointed in my purchase."
1,worst purchase ever made,"After a lot of money, installation expense and now recent calibrations, etc. it still fluctuates so much in temp or just turns icy cold it is impossible to have an enjoyable shower. I echo all the other 1 stars reviews. worst purchase I have ever made in my life. wish I would have read reviews first. Used these overseas and they worked fine - this unit is junk."
1,Don't buy it!,"We purchased this unit to save money on our hot water. It cost $1700 to install between parts and labor. We have had problems with intermittent hot water. Spent another $250 on plumber, had gas company out twice, they replaced the gas meter. It is working better now, but still goes cold for no reason. Not happy with the unit, customer service etc."
4,What a Value!,"I have all the Party Game Books and believe it or not,Ifound this one to be the best!... There are games for kids as well asadults and lots that can be adapted to both. In the back of the book there is a list of all the games along with an age grid which has stars that tell you what age the game would be appropriate for. There is nothing too outrageous and nothing off color but, again, the games are pretty adaptable! There are games that would be great at a backyard carnival and instructions for some of the classics. Its just a generally nice game book to have for reference if you are into games. My 7 year old had a blast at a New Years Eve party that I gave for him and 5 other 7 year olds. Most of my ideas came from this book. END"
1,this is not made in the USA so just be aware of that fact.....,"Two things about this product. The product shown here is ""American Dog"". The product shipped is actually ""Pet Factory"" twists which are in fact made in China. So, what you ""see"" here is not what you ""get"" when you order AND it is not made in the USA so just be aware of these facts. No opinion being stated here...just the facts."
3,Puzzling,"A sequel to 2001? I never quite ""got"" it, but I am told a couple of more viewings and all will become clear."
1,Screen Protector Scratches the Screen,"I liked this case, but didn't understand the landing pegs for the screen protector. In the user guide, it looked as though the pegs were face down on top of the Nano. This was a BAD IDEA!!! I have had the case less than 24 hours and now there are more scratches on the screen than before I got this case. I have a White 4GB Nano. I have since flipped the screen upside down so the pegs don't touch the Nano, but now the protector is too close to the screen and rainbow discoloring shows up. The pegs are pretty pointless other than to scratch your screen. Someone needs to make a hard case that has a click wheel protector. So far, [...] Shield 4 Nano is the best. I would advise against the zCover due to the poor design of the screen protector. 2 Bad cases do NOT equal 1 good purchase."
5,i love it!!!,i bought this Duo pack less than a month ago & it was truly a GOD sent. my nano has not a scratch on it. & the lanyard makes it very easy for me to move around with it hanging around my neck. my only issue is i wish the lanyard were black rather than white.for anyone with a nano ipod this is a must have!!!!
2,Did I miss something?,"I'm not sure if this was some sort of mistake, but why did WWE leave everything off of this DVD?There are ZERO extras, which is weird because if you think about it, they had two months worth of build-up before this event. If you remember, Smackdown! didn't have a PPV after Judgement Day. So one would think some extras would have the U.S. Title Tournament highlights and the Confidential story on Zack Gowen. But nope. None. Zero. Nothing.And for some reason, the UPC code isn't anywhere to be found. So if you were collecting all of the PPV DVD's of this year trying to get that box-set cover...guess what? You won't be able to get it without the UPC.It's a shame WWE had to ruin this PPV with an awful DVD. But for some reason, I think they will re-release the DVD when they notice something went wrong."
5,SD!,HEY SMACKDOWN IIS FUNNY. LOOK RANDY ORTON WILL APPEAR AND RKO UNDERTAKER.AND JBL WILL GET THE PINN.AND MELINA S JULIAN HALLAND HIEDDYS NEW LOOK.
4,There were some great matches here.,I recommend WWE Vengeance to all who like professional wrestling. I was very well entertained by the matches and comentary. I think the WWE goes all out to please us fans to the max.

2,WWE Vengeance 2005,"This ppv is pretty boring!The intercontinental championship match sucked and so did Edge and Kane's match.Kurt Angle's and Shawn Michaels match was'nt that exciting either but it was almost better than the rest of the other matches.Y2J vs Christian vs John Cena was ok but I was sort of dissapointed because Y2J did'nt win the wwe title seeing that Christian was the one who got pinned, and the hell in the cell between HHH and Batista was pretty good,oh and the match between Victoria and Christy Hemme was'nt worth mentioning!"
4,Diva Match Only,"Victoria vs Christy HemmeThis match was pretty good i didnt like how the ending went though Victoria shouldve hit the Widows Peak. Also, i though Trish shouldve returned at this point and make it a Triple Threat for the Womens Title"

2,2 great matches is all i need 2 b happy,chris benoit vs eddy guerreroa good match that was better than their 2002 effort at armageddon da only problem i have with da match is it could have had a better ending rather than da unhelpful interfence from rhyno other than that this match was ****1/4wgtt vs rey and billy kidmanof course this would be a very good match u have this names included in them billy and rey work well together for teaming up for their first time n da wwe but they have been tag team partner n da past during their wcw days while da wgtt keeps on improving every time i saw them on ppv of 2003 this match contains high class spots along with good wrestling i couldn't of ask for more accept additional time because it looks like they were getting into high gear of delievering a tag moty contender i don't know if this was that but very close **** tag team match would have been high if it was couple of mins extra
4,Excellent technical book,"I purchased this book for a gift but thought it was too technical for the recipient. It is a wonderful book for a serious birder, but perhaps too detailed for someone looking ofr color photos and short descriptions."
3,Pretty good game...even with Mark Hamill in it!,"This game is pretty neat. I haven't gotten very far in the game yet, but what i have played so far i have enjoyed. The dialogue is corny at times but funny also. But with Mark Hamill you have to expect that i guess. Don't get me wrong i love star wars just as much as the next person and i do like Mark Hamill, but he can be pretty cheesy at times. Also starring in this game is Tom Wilson, who played as Biff in Back to the Future. Overall, the graphics are very good for 32 bit and you will have a fun time playing it."
2,Wing Commander III for Playstation,"Disappointed. I long ago had the Wing Commander series for the PC. Really enjoyed it, until newer PCs would no long run the DOS games right. When I saw this for the PS2 I was very interested. Game play just isn't right. Button combinations are all wrong and many familiar things just don't work as they should. Extremely frustrated. Now they just sit on the shelf."
2,No fun without a joystick,"Great game on the PC, but it stinks without joystick compatability. In fact the designers must of known how difficult it would be to navigate the game with a D pad, so they didn't even bother hiding the invincibility option.You can also download the entire FMV sequence on a fan website, making this game a complete waste."
4,Hilarious...great gift for obsessed golfers,"If you think YOU'RE crazy about golf, wait til you see this bunch!! Obsessive personalities and golf make a great combination."
4,Helpful when replacing drum brake shoes,It offers a firm grip on the drum brake tension spring and leaves the hook portion exposed to be put on the pole. Caution needed when tighten the holding point ... not too tight otherwise it leaves a bent on the spring ... not too loose or it will slip when pulling the spring.
3,Works better than needle nose pliers on shoe springs,"For those of you like me who can't decide and are considering buying both this item along with needle nose pliers - this item works much, much better at the bottom thicker spring. That said, the metal is starting to bend after first shoe replacement. Be prepared for a strenuous workout when replacing your shoes - night and day compared to replacing pads."
3,Out of Date,"The information and background on Belgium and Luxembourg were interesting, but the restaurant and hotel information was out of date."
2,Not great for a Kindle,"This book had some helpful information and i did use it while I was on my trip, but the Kindle is not a great format for a guide book. I found myself missing the ability to flip through the book quickly and the Kindle book marks just don't cut it for quick access. Also, the pictures in the book are too small and the maps are useless due to size and resolution.I'll never buy a guide book on for a Kindle again."
3,"Not A Useful Guide When You Want To Find the ""There"" There","My wife and I tried to use this guide while we ewre in Brussels for a short visit on our way to other countries, and found it very irritatingly organized and generally much less useful than we'd hoped. We ended up having to mostly figure things out on our own; the book is just okay if you need to find a (very) few restaurant recommendations. Keep looking...:)"
3,Partially good,"The review of the sights were good. There, however, was no warning that the streets can be dangerous. During the first hour we were there and checking into our room, in broad daylight (around 6 PM), the car window in our rent a car was broken, and our 2 suitcases were stolen. The police would not even come, and we had to walk to the nearest precinct to report it."
1,1 star is too much,Flimsy and cheap looking. Had to send it back. I cannot believe Prada would make such a bag.
3,So Small!,"I have a Prada mini and this one isn't but a tiny bit larger . I didn't realize how small it was! It didn't come with the Prada bag nor the COA. I was disappointed when I saw that.It might be good when you only want to carry your keys, cell, a change purse or such. But forget trying to get anything else in it.As they say, you get what you pay for."
4,Like new!,"The textbook's condition was just like if I had bought it brand new from a store, but for a much better price ;D Thank you so much."
1,Really bad.,"I could not make heads or tails of what his point was sometimes, but he seems to be a post-modernist dingbat.What I do know about and could understand is that Bell does not understand evolutionary theory and essentially slanders Darwin like a two bit creationist with some inferences that Darwin was a tool of capitalism and his theory caused racism.He also knows nothing of the wildly exaggerated Y2K crises which he sought to use as an example of our misunderstand of technology, but it was he that didn't get that it was mostly a media snow job like the great shark attack crises of 2001.I could go on, but I have already had to write 3 papers based on this crap and hated having to waste my time reading this junk science.BTW, this is the only text book I have read that is written in the first person if that tells you anything."
1,Run screaming from this book,"I had to buy this book for a class which could be summarized as ""evironmental sociology"". Of course, we had reading assignments from this for class discussion. That's fine, but in this book Bell manages to produce an unreadable dialogue that jumps between narritive and dry facts like a leapfrog on speed.It may be a decent read for a casual reader who is actually interested in the subject matter and is not under any pressure to recite facts. However, the purpose of work such as this is to introduce the basic facts and ideas, but Bell loses the concepts in a labyrinth of words that leave you contemplating: ""uh, what did I just read?""Avoid this at all costs. I'm no expert on the subject, but there MUST be something better than this."
2,BE AWARE!!!!!,"Be aware that this movie should have had a PG-13 rating. I'm not sure why it remained unrated because it is very easy to come to a conclusion this movie is NOT appropriate for children. The chemistry between the actors is phenomenal and some of the dialogue is hilarious. The language is a problem; some of the topics discussed by the two women are definetely inappropriate; the conversation between Terry and Audrey at the picnic was most definetely not for children's ears, but the worst part was when the two of them are in the orchard and there is a bedroom scene. I don't know what kind of dialogue was exchanged because I fast-forwarded this scene. DON'T let your children watch this movie! It will NOT be a part of our movie collection."
4,Oops then Ahhh,The first unit sent was missing a set screw but after a few conversations a new adapter was sent with all integral parts attached and it works flawlessly. I am very satisfied with the product.
3,Hints of the greatness to come,"A lovely DVD, showcasing the early creativity of Jim Henson, Frank Oz, et. al. As individual pieces, these are fun and were startling in their time. As a set, the themes become a bit repetitive, and it is clear that the brilliant timing of the group is still developing. I find it inspiring to know that Mr. Henson and his team had growth and greatness ahead of them."
5,AMAZING!!,"This workout really kicks my butt everytime. Sometimes, I feel like I get used to it...BUT NO! It makes me work out so hard and I always feel like it's my first time doing this video. This is helping me tone up and I love it!!"
5,Kick butt,"This product came very quickly and it is the hardest workout I have ever done, the woman gets annoying but you can't deny the results you get from it!"
4,Really good workout.,"This is a great workout program for people who enjoy some serious cardio without a lot of ""fancy"" moves or choreography. Jeanette does a great job describing the kicks and punches, doing many of them slow first before full speed, so in a few times through the program you're sure to get the hang of it. It doesn't get boring on repeat viewing, and you will definitely work up a good sweat! The routine is also set up with a few ""breaks"" for strength and weight training, so it's very balanced overall.Overall I definitely recommend the program. The only reason I give it 4 instead of 5 stars is the music isn't that great, and the camera work is sometimes a bit clumsy. But still, this is one I've certainly added to my regular workout video rotation!"
4,good overall workout,"I consider myself at an intermediate level of fitness.Instructor manages to be high energy rather than annoying, although, unfortunately, her voice does get whiny/shrieky and having to hear the same conversations over and over on any DVD is a bad thing. All DVDs should come with a music only option to solve this problem.Workout has decent music, non-annoying ""backup dancers"", and the moves are good with kickboxing form that is not painful to watch. Overall, a good workout."
5,forget the Bosstones and the Reel Big Fish - Buy Porkers!!,"the best ska band around today, songs like buds for brains and alcohol are classics, and if u dont buy this u are makin a mistake! on another note - there live show is absolutely sick! Porkman Rulez!"
1,An insult to ska and a waste of resources,"Typical of the utter bilge which has (mis)appropriated the name ""ska"". *Real* ska (there's plenty of it out there - so why not try it) swings, has warmth, displays genuine musicianship and frequently reflects a profound spiritual commitment. This bleached, third-rate, Two-Tone derivative is the exact opposite. Half-witted and ham-fisted cultural appropriation is bad enough; to defile a great musical form is adding insult to injury."
1,Poor quality,"This brush is difficult to use: it is hard to grasp and, worse, the bristles don't grab the hair"
3,Shallow Graves,"Shallow Graves is a story in a small country village. The main character John Pellam is shooting site for films here, until all the trouble starts to begin. He get's involved in a shooting involving drugs. The local police isn't supporting and he is even been trown in jail. It's my first read of J. Deaver and I expected more from him. I hope the other book I got from him will be better, called: The coffin dancer."
4,"Good, not great","Deaver knows how to write a good book. I thought the beginning and end of this book was great, but I had a tough time getting through the middle. I thought The Bone Collector was a much better book. I still think Shallow Graves is a good book and I highly recommend it, something was missing and I just cant put my finger on it."
4,Jeffery Deaver always leaves you guessing,The lead character always comes through strong and intelligent. You can only guess at the end...there is always a twist. Good reading. This was my first on this leading chacter. I had been reading the Lincoln Rhyme novels and they are satisfying for sure..I am going read this character's stories too.
1,Shallow Graves (Location Scout Mysteries),I found this book to be very disjointed and confusing with too many characters seemingly introduced merely as a method of continuing the story forward.I did not enjoy it much.
5,Deaver Does Danger Best!,"Only Jeffrey Deaver stands out among the crowd of contemporary murder, mystery and suspense writers. He's just not written a bad book! It never fails to shock me how this author manages to string me along the thin wire of his storyline all the while I'm working so hard to keep up and to decipher every clue! He is a master author with an incredible sense of timing, story, mood and characterization. His villians are diabolical and seriously disturbed. If you wonder what psychotic or sociopathic means...read this book.""Shallow Graves"" is yet another arm chair-gripping tale from this master wordsmith. Without giving away the story, which synopsis you can read above, let me leave it at this.Once you've tried a Deaver book, there's no going back. Simply said, highly recommended.As to those who are price whining...go to the library.Deb/TheBookishDame"
4,Different Deaver,"Shallow Graves by Jeffery Deaver is a different sort of mystery/thriller than his Bone Collector Lincoln Ryme series, with a different sort of villain(s) than that series. So if the reader is expecting a Bone Collector clone, take note.It is, however an excellent book and John Pellam is a great hero with his dark secrets and nomadic life. Pellam has good instincts and is tenacious in finding the murderer of his friend and partner."
5,Excellent reference you shouldn't be without,I am just getting back to watercolor after many years away from it. I found this book to be a great memory jogger and will find it's way on my shelves near my paint.The book covers many techniques and is very thorough. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED
4,A broad overview,"This book gives a broad overview of watercolor techniques, from loose and washy, to photorealism, including glazing, spattering, color theory, and masking. It's a good way to see all the variety found in watercolor today. I only wish it could have gone into more depth on some of the more unusual techniques."
2,Little more than a toy,"We purchased this for a good friend's son as a toy/potential item of interest. It is so poorly made and hard to keep-in-tune/operate that we'd be embarrassed to give it -- even to a 3-1/2 year old. The name (Lauren) isn't stamped on the body anywhere. There were major finish flaws and signs of poor craftsmanship... sure, it's $30, but for just a bit more, I think you can get a lot more (The Ibanez is $50)... We'll be returning this one. It might be right for some, but know what you're getting -- hopefully the attached images will help you make that decision."
2,BrokenBday,"First, I was upset because I did not get an e-mail letting me know my package was delivered. Keep in mind, I live in FL and in a townhouse, so it was not left on my doorstep, but in my mailbox. Had I not checked to see the arrival time (which was supposedly tomorrow), I would not have not known it was delivered today. My candy would have sat in 80* degree humidity until I got home from work tomorrow. Then I opened the box and the handle to the present was already broken. Not that it's a big deal, but now I have to go buy a basket or bag to put it in and make it pretty again. I was very excited because my brother grew up in the 80's and this is his birthday present. Thought it was a very cool idea, but I ended up being pretty disappointed. I haven't even looked through the candy yet but I could tell you, for $30+ shipping, I was expecting a lot more... hopefully my brother will like it after I fix it up."
1,WHats the difference?,"All the box's seem to have the same items? Only a few differences, and they say they have the right to substitute? All the pictures are the same 1960 box, Whats going on here?"
3,Grammer,"1980's is grammatically incorrect. It should be 1980s. No apostrophe. The only time you would use that is if you are shortening it by decade i.e. '50s, '60s, '70s. It may sound trivial but seriously I can't buy the candy because of it."
2,"Some good, some bad, and not alot","Some nice pieces in there, some pieces I've never ever heard of and definitely far less than I thought it would be. The amount of candy here should be $14.99 to be fair. It was an ok experience, but wouldn't buy again."
3,Lots of candy but not all 80's vintage,"There was definitely a lot of candy in the box but about half of them I wouldn't say were 80's candies. No redhots or sugar babies. I thought the description of what would be in the box included those, even though it did say that the selection would vary. I just was expecting more stuff that I remember from the 80's."
2,Missing Pop Rocks,Basically bought the candy as a present because of the Pop Rocks (meant a lot to the person who this gift was intended for). No Pop Rocks were received although the shipping was quick. Never would have bought it if I had known that it would be missing something that was pictured.
1,Meh,"Not great, too much of this stuff is still way too readily available up to this day in 2011, so even though it's from the 80's, there still no real nostalgia. Perhaps doing other foods like doritos or Pepsi but with their OLD logos would have been much more fun... although that would probably be a lot more expensive."
5,Terrific Gift Idea,"I bought this for my wife on our nineteenth anniversary (please don't tell her I told you that). It arrived well ahead of schedule giving me time to unbox it, hide it and prepare it for the big day. When she opened the box, she spend a good while reliving the summmer days from her youth enjoying these authentic treats.The candy is authentic, brand name, quality goods. The quantity is great. No cheap imitations or ridiculous knock-off as I've seen on other candy basket websites. This gift is a winner. It'll make you a hero and your gift comes later."
5,Wonderful Gift idea!!,I purchased this as a gift for my Son-in-Law..He loved it! The candy was not old or disgusting as another review stated. Wonderful product.
4,Trip down memory lane,"It had the old candy I remember, however the picture makes you think there will be more candy in the box."
3,Candy crate,Some of the candy was good but seemed like a lot were just in there as a filler but was good
3,Meh. It was OK.,"I can see that the 50's, 60's or even 70's boxes seemed a little better in terms of candy content. A lot of the 80's candy is still available at your local grocery or convenience store, so the value just wasn't really there. It was a gift and the recipient seemed to enjoy it, so all's well that ends well, I suppose."
5,Nice retro gift,"Fantastic candy gift box - the amount of candy in this is actually pretty impressive. There are a few items that are just ""meh"" (i.e., wax lips), but the majority were great, classic sugary snacks."
2,Wing Commander IV for PS2,"Disappointed. I long ago had the Wing Commander series for the PC. Really enjoyed it, until newer PCs would no long run the DOS games right. When I saw this for the PS2 I was very interested. Game play just isn't right. Button combinations are all wrong and many familiar things just don't work as they should. Extremely frustrated. Now they just sit on the shelf."
2,Secret Archives - a trick to attract a Western viewer,"This documentary contains very superficial coverage of events, probably useful for those who never heard of the II World War in Russia, not for the serious history minded viewers. No real _secret archives_ are presented - at least 90% of the material was previously openly shown in the former USSR. Certainly not worth the money for 50 minutes film. For those interested I would strongly advise Henry Kissinger's ""Blood upon the snow"" - 10 hours of very detailed information on WWII in Russia presented with deep view upon the modern Russian history."
5,Keeps you on the edge of your seat,"The movie starts off a little slow as you're getting to know the characters, but about a quarter into it you're on the edge of your seat and stay there until the very end. It was non-stop action. Even the special effects were really good. For a ""B"" movie the acting was fantastic. The characters were very believable. Ross Kelly and Stephanie Marchese were awesome. Both are deinitely ""A"" actors. I'd like to see a sequel, if it's as well written as this one was."
3,Low Budget Entertainment,"This C Grade budget movie appears inspired by the 1958 Sinbad Movie with its low budget sci-fi graphics bringing to life an army of skeletons. (Obviously Pirates of the Caribbean comes to mind) On the modern day Baja peninsula, young adventurous dune racing enthusiasts have an innocent encounter with Coronado's 1590 conquistador army of skeletons; guarding their lost gold"
2,Un-original and nothing special,"A group of people go out to the desert to celebrate someone dorks birthday by desert racing, only the professor of the group has a double intention to find some lost gold in which he does find and releases a curse that anyone who steal the gold, or knows where the gold is hidden is hunted down by an army of skeletons.If you can't resist watching this, don't expect to see any decent acting or a much of a plot. For a low budget movies the cgi they used is not that bad considering, but the blood will make you roll on the ground laughing.You won't kick yourself for missing this film in your life, the cover is much more appealing then the movie itself."
1,Terrible - a ZERO,"This was really, really awful - bad script, acting, and the effects were definitely sub-par. I can deal with cheese, but this was just one of those movies that make you wonder how it got financed, completed, and released. Most movies that the Sci Fi Channel does are better than this and that's saying a great deal. The story line had potential, but everything else just causes it to flat line.Movies of this type that were done better? Army of Darkness (plenty of cheesy fun) or any of the Mummy movies. Other reviewers seem to like it which makes me wonder if they were involved with the film somehow. See for yourself, but don't say you weren't warned!"
5,Shocking Information presented by Mothers and Parents who Care,"Simply put, I was blown away by the information presented in this DVD. The film is produced by a Mother who takes the viewer on a journey to discover the dangerous truth about the toxicity of vaccines and does it in a way that is stripped of corporate bias. She interviews the leading experts in this debate and does so in an organic and honest way. Films like these are always produced by people and not corporations and I applaud the efforts of the filmmakers who reported on a topic vital to the future of our children with honesty, integrity and intelligence. No one gets Academy Awards for reporting the truth such as what is presented in this film but if Awards were given for information, love and integrity, this film brings home Best Picture in my eyes. I vote this film as a must see, bar none, for anyone who cares about kids."
2,Do not buy,"You Do not need this, you can just buy regular silicone spray that is not as expensive as this one is."
5,Holds the interest of a formerly disinterested 9 year old!,"My 9 year old granddaughter has had difficulty reading and subsequently hasn't liked reading anything -- until I got the first 4 of this series. We finished ""Dinosaurs Before Dark"" in a couple of bedtime reading sessions and she's still talking about it! We'll start the next book this weekend and she's actually looking forward to it. Hopefully, I'll be buying the entire series."
1,"poor writing, unimaginative stories","I purchased the first set of books in this series for my 4 1/2 year old, and feel that I was misled by the many positive reviews. The stories do touch on topics that kids love, but they are not at all imaginative. Key devices are lifted from far superior fantasies (ex: the Narnia books) and what little scientific and historical fact they contain is often inaccurate. Worse, for books whose audience presumably includes many new readers, they are packed with grammatical errors! I often wonder why many of the older kids that I teach can't write a complete sentence. If this is their model, I need wonder no longer! While I admit that my son has enjoyed them, I sense that he will very soon outgrow the simplistic stories. So - sorry to the fans, but I just don't see it."
1,The author must have slept through grammar school...,"I bought this set for my 5 year old, and she loves them. As I read them aloud, she hangs onto my every word...and that would be the problem. The grammar in these books is absolutely horrific. They are filled with incomplete sentences and poor phrasing. I constantly find my self correcting things as I read aloud. While I do like the story lines for young children, I can't in good conscience recommend these to any children who will actually be doing the reading themselves. I would be too afraid it would seriously hinder their writing abilities. I do, however, think they are great platforms to start discussions about dinosours, etc. The little tidbits of info are great though sparse, and I add a lot of elaboration about the subjects. In summary, these books are a mixed bag, and I would encourage anyone interested to read through them before purchasing them so you can decide how much it bothers you. I know I will not be buying any more of this series."
2,A shame that the author did not show more concern about her craft,"I give this series two stars for providing an easy transition from picture books to chapter books.I did not give it more than two stars, though, because the books are sloppy and shallow, and their grammar is horrible. (Since I was reading the books to my son, I could at least make corrections on the fly.) The characters are not only flat stereotypes (scholarly, rational brother and his emotional, impulsive sister), but in the majority of the stories, they are almost completely passive. Things simply happen to them. There is little display of ingenuity or independent problem solving on the part of these two ""heroes"".It is too bad that the author did not show more concern about her craft. If she had, my son and I would probably still be reading her books. Instead, after getting our toes wet with the first few volumes, we quickly moved on to better material (namely, Dragon Slayers' Academy)."
2,Buyer BEWARE: Publisher: Shame on you!,"Review of the physical product: The paper these small books are printed on is newsprint. no kidding. The books are not even up to scholastic publishing quality. Shame on you publisher for putting a book on such poor quality paper. There is really no excuse what so ever for printing this on newsprint paper. I use to work in the print industry. You shouldn't be paying more than 5 dollars for the set of 4 books. Really. On top of that, the books are physically ultra thin. The first book is a grammatical train wreck. There are fragment sentences, and sentences so poorly constructed that an educated adult writing for children could not possibly have written this. While I read this book to my son i verbally edit all the rot out of the book. Shame on the author too.The story is nice. My son likes it. But there really is no reason for the problems listed above except for lazyness and greed. This is my first review. Enjoy."
3,Not a series I recommend ... not interesting,"The best thing about the Magic Tree House books is that they are informative.At one time, we went all-in on MTH and had about 30 of them. And my oldest read them -- don't get me wrong. But the books aren't funny or engaging or even classic stories. And the narration is just blah. Lots of telling, not much story. These books have been marketed like crazy, and they ARE informative, but they're not fun to read.There is nothing engaging about the characters, and nothing ever really happens in the series. Sometimes Annie and Jack don't take more than 25 steps from the tree house (Pirates comes to mind). They are just words on a page.For early reader series (especially for boys), my kids prefer Roscoe Riley Rules and Geronimo Stilton -- both are very quick to reel your reader in. Kids gobble them up for their clever humor and great characters."
5,Great stories,Was looking for good material for my 1st grade son and this was perfect. He has really enjoyed the series.
5,Great Read Aloud for young kids (4+) that teaches history,"The Magic Tree House series is a great stepping stone between picture books and chapter books. Most books written for a pre-k listening level take place in a realistic setting, like school. Not so with the magic tree house, it takes Jack and Anne throughout time and space: from the time of the dinosaurs to the future when men have colonized the moon. The books are exciting to read: Jack and Anne are often in real danger, though you know they will always make it back home. These books are also available in an audio format. I recommend reading at least the first four books. If you, the adult reader, gets bored, try playing the audio versions.I also think this box set makes a great birthday present for 4 and 5 year olds. At first the child can be read aloud to, and when they start reading, they can use it as an early reader.The audio version of these books (read aloud by the author) is also worthwhile."
4,Careful with some 6 yr.olds,"My granddaughter loves to read about Jack and Annie but then has trouble sleeping. Perhaps a year later would have been better! The stories are great and the learning is wonderful, though. Time will help separate fact from fiction for her."
4,7-year old son loves the series,"My subject pretty much says it all. We of course had to buy the next 2 boxed sets (5-8; 9-12) and now, our son has been bugging us to get the new boxed set but it's not available till May 2008.I recommend this as a gift, and it's a good addition to your kid's ""library""."
3,Remedy,"At first I received my items in the wrong condition. I was told that my books would not be written in and that there was ""minor"" wear on the edges. When I received my items, one of the books had writing in it and it look as if someone tried to tear it in half on the binding. When I notified the seller, I received quick responses and a new book. I wish that it was not that difficult but my concerns were quickly acknowledged and they sent me a new book free of charge to replace the damaged one."
2,"Ok, but not well written, overall.","The first book in the series wasn't too bad. It was filled with suspense and exciting dinosaurs! However, after reading #2 and #3 I came to the realization that apparently the writing wasn't going to get any better. These books are written in simple sentence format, too juvenile for most kids I think. Also the author includes phrases like, ""I'm going to kill her!"" and living in the times that we do, I don't think this is appropriate. Also I didn't think the stories flowed well. They were way too choppy and broken up. We were left scratching our heads after some of it. Overall, I think you can do much better with other series'. The Boxcar Children would be one of my suggestions. I thought the premise these books are based on was so fun and held great promise. Oh well."
2,"Engaging Stories, but REALLY Poor Grammar","I bought these for my five & six year olds. I decided to have them be a read aloud instead of letting them read them on their own. The stories are interesting to them, my son especially enjoys the adventures, but the grammar is so choppy that you really must read ahead and re-word 85% of the time. I think we will pass on the rest of the series and look for something else."
5,Very good set,A very good set for young readers. It's great fun and very imaginative reading. I can't recommend it highly enough!
5,Wonderful stories,Very magical stories that encourage reading. I donated these to my local elementary school library. Children love these books very much.
2,Not Very Good for Learning English,I teach my 4 y.o. son English (native Russian) and found this book very harmful for learning language. It seems like after reading those stories my son's speaking skills were poor than before.Really don't reccomend these stories for learning English like foreign language.2 stars only for pretty intresting stories idea.
4,Great series,"Bought this for a non-reader and he just loves them. Not quite ready for the Harry Potter series, but maybe this will get him motivated. Reviews and a TV show brought me to this series. Will be buying the rest."
5,Great books,I love that these books are fictional but have factual elements to them. These books are great for boys in that they are mystery types that get young boys interested when they aren't wanting to read.
4,Good for a parent to child read.,"My son has loved me reading these books to him so far, enough so that we've purchased the first two sets. Easy read, simple enough story line, something a young one can follow and hold interest in."
3,Great books - Wrong volumes,"I had already purchased the first book of the series, read it to my kids, and loved it enough to buy this set from amazon (and the next set, too). This set of 4 said it included books volume 1-4, however in the shipment I received - VOLUME 1 WAS NOT INCLUDED. I received 2 copies of book #2 instead. Luckily we already had book #1 at home! The next series (books 5-8) was complete, so hopefully it was just an isolated error."
5,Magic Tree H,My grandson loved having the books read to him. He couldn't wait to get to the next one - hopefully he'll read them again and again when he gets older. V
2,Not great as far as writing....,"..but my 6 year old loves these books. She's entering 1st grade this fall and we've been reading these over the summer (I read them to her). She loves the stories and is always eager for the next in the series. I have to agree though, that the grammer is awful. If I have to read ""Jack said.."" or ""Annie said..."" one more time I think I'll scream. There's never any variation, always ""Jack said; Annie said"". Urg.I don't think we'll be spending any more time on this series as I just don't think I can slog through any more of these books. Too many great chapter books out there that far outshine The Magic Treehouse books."
2,great subject matter poorly handled,I have found this series very disappointing overall. The premise is great-- kids travelling through books to fascinating places and times. But the plots and language are so simple and the characters so undeveloped that I can't get my child (or myself) motivated to finish the books. Well-written non-fiction on the same topics would be not only more informative but more engaging.
3,wasnt impressed,I guess I wanted to learn more about Vermont than I did the train stuff. The video is nice and worth the money if you are into trains ......Its a definetly must have
4,"Good product, easy to use","I like this Avery product a lot - most Avery stuff is easy to use without issues. I don't understand why they don't provide more of the labels & inserts. It's an expensive kit, but certainly does the job."
3,Not as good as it looks,"I have had this spatula for almost a year now.Pros:Looks nice.Nice hefty handle.Cons:The head is a little loose (wobbles a bit on the handle).The head has a pebbled finish to which food, especially eggs, likes to stick. Sometimes ittakes quite a bit of scrubbing to clean it.The spatual is handle heavy and tends to fall out of the pan if it's not being used.I have some cheaper spatualas that, while not as pretty, are easier to clean, sturdier, and don't fall outof the pan."
1,"Tragic, but true ,evryday extreme ghetto living. MY RATE IS 10 STARS!!!!!!!","THIS BOOK DESERVES 10 STARS!!!! this book was very well put together, I thought it was going to be like tne authors other 2 books ,but surprisingly it wasn't. I couldn't put it down, Thug's main girl let too much stuff get out of hand ,his cousin,and her son should have been nipped in the bud from the gate,although she took a lot of crap from him she shouldn't have let him go out like that. MUST READ!!!! I only wish that Thug lived ,to the author Please keep doing you, you're excellent at it . I ENJOYED your other 2 books as well!! I MEANT TO GIVE THIS BOOK 5+ STARS!!!"
5,OMG!!!!,"I'm upset that this is my first book by Noire!!! Despite some of the neg. reviews, I felt that this book was so well written, it played cinematically in my mind.I will in know way, give any details to the book...but there is a little bit of everything for your emotions, you might shed a tear, be in fear, have to take a cold shower...but she pulls you right in with the character Thug, Muddah, Pimp, Noojie...this list goes on.Now I have to purchase G Spot and Candy Licker."
4,Scan-da-licious,"Another great story by Noire. Characters you love to hate. Andre aka ""Don't want to rap it up"" aka ""Thug-A-Licious"" Williams leads the pack with his talent, smooth talk and womanizing ways. But no matter how many women he beds no one can take the place of his lifetime love and soulmate Ms. Carmeisha aka ""Muddah"" aka ""No back bone"" Vernoy. Both face many challanges along the way and the main one was Carl aka ""Pimp"" Williams. From beginning to end he leaves his mark by doing the most scandalous things possible. He is Thug's cousin but acts like his arch enemy and a wolf in sheeps clothing. He preys on anyone no matter what age and doesn't care who he hurts. Family or not. His presence sends chills up your spine because he is nothing nice. This book was a page turner and the end proves meaningful."
2,Suck-a-liciuos,"I have read 5 novels by Noire over the past couple of years,Thug being my3rd one in a row followed by G-spot & Candylicker.To say I was disappointedby this book is an understatement,not to mention that I wasted my hard earnedmoney on this abortion of a book.I have always tried to support & show lovefor Noire since we are both from NY but with material like Thugaliciuos thatis not always an easy thing to do.The book does start off on a good foot butsomewhere in the early middle it falls flat on it's face,as far as the erocticparts they where decent but not on the level of Zane.The plot,story line andthe characters are very weak.If your looking for a good read this is not it,dont waste your time or money with this book.I always thought that with timeNoire would be in a catagory with K'wan or Erick S Gray who both give it toyou raw in there books,but that just has not happened yet.I'm hoping that thenext Noire novel I read ""Hittin the Bricks"" will change my opinion."
3,Am I The Only One...?,"...who realized that Chapter 1 and 35 or 39 are basically the same with just a few small differences between them? It was weird and threw me off. I'm really starting to dislike this ""urban"" genre. Contrary to popular belief, many of us urbanites do know how to read and we DO know the difference between a good, interesting and well written book and the ridiculous typo-riddled, incomplete and CHEAP trash that these hood writers are trying to get us to buy!Sorry had to rant. I do like Noire as a writer, but maybe I'm too nitpicky to have found this book enjoyable."
3,Baby Maker,"Oh my goodness Andre was a whore. All he ever did was stick and move, 9 months later another baby. Hell he didn't even know all of their names. I don't know when he had the time and energy to hustle and go to school. His cousin Pimp was the main character in the book. He was truly a cold piece of work. Every character and everything grimy that happened in the book had something to do with him.The overall book was O.K. I was hoping for a stronger ending, but I did appreciate how Noire referenced her other novels through out the story. I must admit I am glad that I read G-Spot and Candylicker first; because Thug-A-Licious did not pack as much punch. But, I am still a fan."
3,good but still dissapointed,"I normally take about 5-6 days to read a book that is actually good. This book took me nearly two weeks. I am not accostumed to this genre, this my first time reading an urban erotica/fiction story. The storyline wasnt horrible but it definetly couldve been better. Why didnt Noire allow Carmeisha to finally tell Thug the truth about Pimp.? Or why did Pimp really have to go through that at the end of the book. I feel as though the story was unfinished. Maybe she should release a sequel. Then again, without Pimp the story isnt much."
2,a BIG let down =(,". i really liked g-spot it was a really good read but this one was a big let down . when you think of the title so many idea's come to mind but the book it's self was lame. the plot, the characters and making no cents . I've have 3 books of noire that where good . I really was expecting more from this author . it's like she or he get wrost with time not better.g-spot 5 starshood 3 stars . you know whats going to happen the whole bookcandy lickers - 2 starsthig-a-licious- 1 star"
3,HOT!!,Wow Noire Knows what she is doing when she gets down with these books YO i love the way she writes how raw in your face she is i NEVER was a reader you couldnt even catch me reading a book ever Noire has made me a complete book worm an a erotic book junkie i have yet to see a author other than Zane who is in your face like this HOT!!!
3,Was it really that LICIOUS????,"""Thug-a-licious"" was a pretty good read. It centers on the life of three family members, Pimpalicious, Smoovealicious, and Thugalicious. Yeah right.Noire takes you for a quick spin with these three characters with the plot being centered on Thug. He's a kid from the hood that's seen too much, done too much, and finally has a chance. He's in love with his childhood sweetheart, Muddah, whose a true rid-or-die chick that has a genuine love for him despite his numerous baby mama's.Thug has so many demons from his past that he's dealing with while trying to better himself as a rapper and a future NBA player. Enjoy this tale as Noire develops the characters and their growth from kids to adulthood and eyeopening experiences of the evilness that dwells within their family."
3,The last had to be the first...,"I really like Noire's novels. They are rich with imagry that I enjoy reading and being taken into her world. In comparison to her other 2 books, this one had to have taken place way before the G-Spot because Granite McKay is in the story line. I believe that she knew better not to debut this book because it is not on the level of The G-Spot or Candylicker. If I had read this book before the other two, I really don't think I would be a fan of hers today. That is not to say that Noire isn't a great writer, just that her marketing was on point. The G-Spot & Candylicker were way better stories than Thug-a-licious."
4,Back With a BANG!,"Noir worked it out once again in this urban tale that was full of twists and turns, and unexpected instances. I have to say this was something completely different and not like the taboo books, G-Spot and Candy Licker, although it did have the same premise. I thouroughly enjoyed the story although at one point near the end I got confused because i thought a character was dead and he came back????? otherwise, great read, can't wait for the next one."
3,Good Read but expected more,Noire did her thing but it could have been better. Some of the events were just left hanging. IT COULD'VE ENDED MUCH BETTER. And the role of the Muddah could have been more linked to Thug.
4,Just a good read,"I liked this book but not as much as Noire's first 2 books the plot was ok i just think it should have been more explosive since it started out slow truthfully I almost didn't get pass chapter 3 if I had to read \thug-a-licious, pimp-a-licious or smooth-a-licious 1 more chapter I was done hated those names. I also would have like to see pimp suffer a little bit he need to be tossed in somebody's dungeon or something all and all I like Noire this is not the best book but it's not the worst and I recommend it to all Noire's readers it not G-spot or candy licker but it is a good read don't rush to get it but don't miss it either."
1,Disappointing,It was very disappointing.... Pimp should have died @ the beginning... and that boy Jahlil.. i just don't believe a person can come out being bad like that.. i think Noire dropped the ball on this one.
3,Not What I Expected .......2.5,"I LOVE Noire's other books-this one was pretty good after you get half way threw it! I swear it was too detailed and I hope this was written before the other ones because, the dead has come back!!!!{read and see what I mean} I think Muddah was a ride or die type chick but DAM* how much are you suppose to take?! I will admit I liked the way it ended which is rare for me. If you are new to Norie PLEASE DON""T let this be your first read!"
1,Wild Goose Chase,"All of that for what???..this book was just all over the place. What???? Did Noire run out of sex scenes because she used the same one like two or three times and I mean the EXACT SAME SCENE only the names changed...come on...if there was some kinda way to get a refund, I'd be in line!!!!"
2,Too dry,Not enough wetness as you move your way down the container - had to add liquid to use last of pads
2,I wish I could return these,"They really are small....and very thin..plus, they don't have a lot of liquid product. Cotton balls work better than this. Don't buy."
4,Good product if you have a small pet.,"I purchased this product for my shepherds and golden retrievers, but ended up using it on our cats. The pads are too small to use on a large breed dog. Worked fine on the cats though."
4,Works well.,"We have a cat with chronic dirty ears. These are nice to have on hand for a quick wipe. It's hard to get ""down in there"" with these pads, but they do the job for the most part."
2,Book falling apart,"The way this book was put together shows how poor the quality of this book is. Three days after I bought it, the book pages were coming out like if there was no glue to keep them together. 50 bucks wasted!"
3,Champion Pitchers Plate,"Pitchers plate recieved did not match picture. Only has one spike on each side. Still stayed in place for games. However, the rubber has started to wear away on the traffic area of the plate after a few full days of use. I have ordered the pitchers plate in the picture before it was made of a more durable material."
2,"Cute, but worthless","I bought the whole collection of these adorable ""functional"" items from Sassy. But I am completely disappointed with this aspirator. The rubber is so thick, you can't squeeze it tight enough to get anything out. To put it simply... The suction sucks! Total waste of money. Like too many baby items out there, it is cute and worthless."
2,Dresden Codex,I was surprised to find this book in Spanish. I still haven't decided whether I will keep it or not.
3,Frustrated in NC,The item arrived on time but the package was torn and the plastic container that holds the pens was cracked in two or more places. This was supposed to be a new item and I would expect the plastic container not to be cracked for the amount paid. If it continues to crack then there is no where to store the pens and tips. I was not satisfied with the quality of packing. The pens inside work fine. But I was under time constraints and could not send it back for a replacement.
1,"TERRIBLE, DO NOT BUY X-OOM!!!!","This product does not do work as advertised. It will not convert 99% of your DVD because of copyright laws. You must have another program called ""mcldecrypt.exe"" to decrypt your DVD's. Don't waste your time or your money on this product. Take it from someone who did."
5,Just What The Doctor Ordered...,"This shampoo is the best!! I own & show several American Bulldogs. A couple of them have mild allergies, which sometimes results in a dry, flaky coat. Our Vet recommended using a medicated shampoo, however we discovered that most were simply too harsh. While they worked fine on the skin irritations, they did nothing to remedy the dull and dry coats. I was using another shampoo, when I happened upon this product. I am so glad I decided to give it a try! Nova Pearls Dandruff has really improved their coats and it's a wonderful follicle flusher!! Best of all, this shampoo addressed the moisture issue that none of the other products could. If your dog is plagued with dry, itchy skin, give Nova Pearls Dandruff formula a try. You'll be glad you did!"
1,not happy,"i would love to review my hero when it arrives??????????????????this is what lets down amazon,the time it takes to arrive purchased 22nd october"
4,A Very Sweet Film,"In all honesty I purchased this dvd because it was cheap and had the sexy Kristen Bell (Veronica Mars) in it. I wasn't expecting much from it, but it turned out to be a heart-warming film. The performances were excellent and it had a nice look to it. There are no extras and it only comes in full-screen (it was a made-for-tv movie) but it was entertaining enough to watch. I'm glad I bought it."
4,The king and Queen of moonlite Bay,This was a very good family movie. it will make you laugh and cry has a good uplifting end. you'll want to watch it again.
3,the queen,"On Moonlight BayI found this movie on TV in australia and thought I should have it and sure enough Amazon had it and I just received it recently. I loved the script and I thought Kristen Bell played her part wonderfully. No matter how small the movie,it does'nt have to be expensive to make, when the script is good and the players. Robert Warren...Australia."
4,movie,"While I really like Tim Matheson, the movie was ok, but I can't have it where my grandchildren might watch it even though they are in their early teens.. Explicit education should come from their parents. But, my friends will borrow it. As for the pkg..it shipped as new and was in fine shape and on time."
5,Nostalgic walk down memory lane.,"My mother had a copy of this cookbook and used it extensively thru the 1970's. After my mother's death the book was either lost, or donated on accident. When I found this copy available I was thrilled!I see many of my childhood favorites, and no matter what you may hear you can NOT get any recipe you want on the internet (trust me I've looked).Thank you !"
4,Pretty good condition,Good for the $$. I like using this for my remediated high school English 12 class because it gives good examples and is a good resource for providing handouts on the occasions I need to do that.
2,a little disappointed,"When I bought this book, I was under the impression that I was getting the CD that comes with it naturally. Therefore, I was verry disappointed when I didn't see it at the reception of the product, and I was never told during the transaction about that important information, which was crucial to me because I use this book for school purpose. The CD contains the resources for the homeworks.Beside that, the transaction went smoothly; the order came on time"
2,worse than other,"this writing first is worse than i expected, my classmate spend the same price brought one, his book is better mine, it looks more newer than mine.it's not like what the seller said,it's very old, not areceiptable.the only lucky thing is it's mail on time."
2,Book 1 was much better.,"There is two basic types of info in this installment. Stories and product endorsements. Book 1 has the hart of the info you want from a hunting in AK book. This book is more geared towards hunters that have not evolved past the ""Kill everything"" and ""I will only take trophies"" phase of there life's. If you are an evolved hunter or are not yet ready to evolve, don't bother with this one. If he dose write a book 3 at some point I do hope it only has 5 sections, 1 dedicated to each of the big five to hunt in AK and each simply with the where and how to hunt said animal. If it is so, I would buy it as book 1 was good. Having said that, the author is a good guy, I just think this book is a little miss marketed or that he was put off track in the process of writing it."
2,Looks plastic. Disappointed.,"The pearl doesn't look real, has a pinkish hue, and is much larger than in the picture. It overpowers the garnet. Overall, the pendant is not attractive. The cord is pretty but I cannot swap out the pendant to wear any other pendant on the cord. I returned this item the same day that I received it."
2,Cheap looking,"I don't know what I was expecting, something maybe a bit larger/heavier. I have been looking for bridesmaid gifts- the reason for my purchase- but this doesn't fit my need. I prefer a larger pendant portion."
3,No page numbers,"Kindle recently released an update to support print page numbers however this text has not yet been offered with the print page numbers. As a graduate student this is quite annoying. Often times my professor will simply email us ""read pages 24-30"" without listing the topic, or turn to page ___ in class. I love the fact that I can read my textbook wherever without the extra back pain, but would love to know what pages I'm reading in order to keep up with everyone else in class."
5,Reminding me about Statistics,Recently I started back to school to obtain my PhD in Marketing. I have been having trouble remembering all my statistical terms since the last time I was in school 20+ years ago for my MBA. This text is SOO VERRRYY Helpful! It is humorous and in Layman's word for understanding. Highly recommend if being asked to do your MANOVA's ANOVA's Chi Sq & Z's again.
5,A better product at a better price.,I bought these for a piece of equipment I have in one of my warehouses. It cost about 70% less and last about 300% longer than the same product I purchased locally. I don't know why and I not sure I care.
5,Hella H3 bulb,I purchased this bulb to replace an existing bulb in my hella 500 series fog lights. This bulb was a direct fit and looks to be a bit briter than the original. Very good product.
4,Motorcycle fog lights,"Great service, arrived in the time limit and very well packed for maximum protection. Thank you Amazon for the wide range of online merchandise."
5,bulb,Using a55w or 100w bulb on a hunting lamp would cetainly kill your 12v battery in a short while. a 33w has proved worth while replacement.It's too early to tell how long it will last.
1,not much luck with these bulbs,I put these bulbs in a set of fog lights and both of them were burnt out within a week. They were quite brite before they burned out but they did not last.
5,Great Stuff: Just Be Careful Who You Buy It From!!,"My girlfriend has been using this product for years and it isn't cheap in department stores, running around $110.00. I found some here for $39.99 and thought I had hit the jackpot. Well, as it turns out, the product was either defective or bogus, probably the latter. My girflfriend knew within five minutes of her first use that something was amiss and she showed me the differences definitively. If you haven't tried this before, call Chanel and have them send you a sample so that you know what it smells like on your skin, know how it develops, and know how long it lasts. Caveat emptor! You get what you pay for!!"
1,Not the real stuff,"This is not the original parfum. Vendor claims it is but, I used to work for a perfume company and know that their distribution channels are not as he claims."
1,"never got this product and after a month, got reimbursement!",Don't know why product never came. I had to keep after seller who finally told me product would not come. Should be no stars but review format would not accept.
3,TurboTax wasn't as great this year as previous years!,"Usually this software performs outstanding in tax preparation, however, this year in particular, I found it was confusing, especially when dealing with the government rebate. The IRS says to not enter the amount you received, but enter what you didn't receive (i.e. if entitled to $300 and only received $160, you should enter $140), this software has you enter what you received and early on, I believe it was affecting the tax refund amount. Online updating is great if you have a broadband connection. .."
1,Download troubles,"TurboTax Deluxe does not actually include the state version, although you'll only find that out if you read the teeny tiny print. They have available a download version of the state software, but there are plenty of problems with that and their support services aren't able to help. After an evening of trying to make it work, I have given up. So I recommend against purchasing a download."
1,Don't Buy Turbo Tax for Mac,"I have gotten the worst ""tech support"" I have ever experienced when I've tried to get help with some nasty bugs in turbo tax 2001 for mac. I don't recommend turbo tax for mac to anyone - I even spoke to supervisors at their tech support number to no avail. They appear to have no knowledge of the program. Unless you plan on having absolutely no questions/problems (which of course is highly unrealistic) I suggest buying Tax Cut, where the support is way better."
3,Warning,"Just so everyone knows- Intuit only allows you to use one rebate when purchasing its products, so you cannot use the quicken upgrade and the quicken/turbotax rebate in combination."
5,Life drops are a perfect name,"This is vital for fine curly hair,to keep it hydrated and healthy. Awesome product. Smells a bit funky, but doesnt transfer to your hair...."
2,Ilx,"I did not like this product , it felt no difference in my hair . I would not purchase again because it dose not work for me."
2,"Unless you want to live on lamb and pork, go elsewhere","This book is written by a Brit, and although the measurements are wonderfully translated into American terms, the author doesn't take the american diet into consideration. Many, if not most, of the recepies call for either bacon, pork, or lamb. To my knowledge, most american's don't use lamb as a mainstay of their diet and I personally avoid pork. As a result, I returned this book. I did find the introduction helpful because it nicely explains the uses of the various attachments in a clear and concise way. Other than that, this book is irrelevant to my way of eating."
2,Not to my liking,"This book is not Real Food for the American diet, at least mine anyways. My husband did not find one recipe that we would use.If you like unusual dishes then this book is for you, or if you are into European dishes then buy it."
4,interesting personal essay,"The author makes it clear that this short book is an essay on her thoughts concerning the effects of feminisism on college campusus; in particular she refers to her experiences at Princeton.I found the book to be very easy and enjoyable reading. As someone who has attended a ""Take back the Night"" events on a college campus, her observations really resonated with me.This is really not a reference work; someone who wants studies and data needs to look elsewhere. But, if someone wants to think about the various ideologies on the relations between the sexes, this essay is a good place to start."
1,No power supply,I wish that I had read the reviews here before I bought this. The review says what the web page does not say. This product does not come with a battery or any other means of powering it. I am returning it.
3,A solid anthology of songs by others but not one of his best,"Bill Staines is an excellent songwriter in his own right. With this recording, he captures some of the songs written by others that he has performed over the years. There are some very good selections here. However, if you want a taste of the genuine Bill Staines at his best, pick one of the ""Million Miles"" compilations or another of his originals."
3,Romeo vs. D290,My impression of these 2 machines.We bought the Romeo first than returned it 6 months later due to too many electrical problems (even after Nespresso repair) and replaced it with the D290.Romeo pros: Beautiful modern designGreat coffeecons: Useless cup warmerUseless self cleaning mode (very annoying)Mediocre frothing deviceToo many electronics that could (does) go wrongToo expensive to justify all the electronicAutomatic capsul ejectionD290 pros: Great coffeeEase of useCapsule is ejected automatically when user wants toLess electronic that could go wrongcons: Spout might be a little low for larger cupsFrothing deviceA little noisier than the RomeoBottom line: If you can forgo the great looks of the Romeo get the D290.Frother at both machines is not very good. Use a Bodum hand frother that works faster cleaner and creates great froth.Coffee is great with both machines.Enjoy
3,Great espresso - not so great machine over the long run,"My father in law got this machine and I loved it so I bought one for myself. I bought it in April 2006 - in May 2007, it started having electrical problems. It is out of the warranty period and Nespresso is charging $125 to repair it. In the meantime, my father-in-law went through 2 of them and had the same issue. When it works, it works great but when it breaks, it's expensive (out of warranty). While I do the love the look and the espresso, I think I'm going to take my $$ and buy a less complicated model."
4,Easy to use,"Nice , easy to operate , with a useful feature - self rinsing that prevents water calcification"
3,Just ok...,My son needed a second mobile for the daycare center and I thought that since he loved black and white shapes/patterns he would like this mobile...He is indifferent to it...it's just okI think it gives him something to look at which is better than nothing but the fact that it only has a wind up motor (which lasts maybe one minute) does little good.
3,eh,"SOOO.... Mobiles are very expensive! I got this one for my son, so we could have him sleep in his crib (he is five months old). It has instructions which say not to wind it too much, and I didn't, but the string broke after less than a week of use! Now it won't wind or play music and I have to spend another fifty dollars on one that takes batteries! My son still likes it, but I was disappointed that it broke so quickly."
3,"Great shapes/designs, poor quality mobile base/music","Great shapes and designs for activating baby's brain, but very flimsy crank-style music/motion dial that only lasts about three minutes. I took the shapes off and put them on another mobile base with remote control music that lasts 30 minutes."
4,My daughter loves this!,Overall this was a great investment! My 7 week old daughter seems to love it. It really holds her attention! My only criticism would be that it is a wind-up device and the mobile doesn't spin for very long. I would be more than willing to spend a little more for it if it had a battery-powered motor. Also it would be nice if you had an option to turn the music off as it is a bit loud for her to fall asleep to. But I'm definitely happy with my purchase.
4,Baby loves it!,"My 2 month old loves this mobile! She can see the strong contrast which allows her to begin to track the items. She stays entertained for a good 15 minutes in her crib. The 3 downfalls are: the cards are a little too tight of a fit and make it difficult to insert into the bottom of the shapes, although you are secure in knowing they won't fall out on baby! 2) the music does not last long enough & 3) it would be nice if you could pivot the mobile out of the way when you put baby in or out of the crib. Overall, this product does what it is supposed to-gain baby's attention and keep her entertained."
4,Great buy for the price,"This mobile caught my son's attention immediately. He is 2 months old and loves to look at it. I love that I can see him tracking the squares as they float overhead. I do wish that the wind up would last longer, but after about 3 times winding, he's had his fill of it anyway. I think he gets overstimulated."
3,any money mark album is better than this one,"if you're a completist, you're already going to buy this and you won't care what i say ... for everyone else, buy *any* money mark studio album, all of them are better ... the sound quality is a tad weird and all the songs are played a little too much off rhythm.what's weird is i met money mark once and had him sign a copy of this cd. he said, ""is this any good?""i said, ""it's not bad, but it's definitely not your best. it's my least favorite record of yours, but it still kicks the hell out of 99% of the music in the world.""he said, ""i've never heard it, actually. it doesn't surprise me that it's not great -- i was really drunk when we did that show."""
4,buy this dvd before 511!,"this dvd is great for any new order fan because it includes classic footage from the ""Taras Shevchenko"" video that was filmed back in 1981. in addition to the 1998 Reading Festival footage, this dvd also includes a 20 minute conversation with New Order. my only complaint is that the mic levels were too low during the conversation. for the price, this dvd is a great buy from a great band!(the 511 dvd is also good for certain reasons, but lacks guitar/synth player Gillian Gilbert who did not tour with the band for the ""GetReady"" shows.)"
5,Great Concept and works great,"This keyboard is amazing. I bought it for my daughter and it can do all kinds of things.I agree the packaging to open is tough but what product is not these days.It is so fun kids can pretend they are in a orchestra or even add melodies and instruments to songs through the MP3 player feature.Sure it does not teach anyone how to use a keyboard but it never advertised that it can.Each tube does something different when you wave your hand in front of it (drums, change melodies,etc.Way more fun than an average keyboard and can also double as a mp3 speaker."
1,It would be great if it worked!!!!,"This was the ONLY thing my 9 year old son asked for for Christmas. When we unpackaged it on Christmas morning...the only way we could get it to work was through the headphones...the exteral speakers did not work. We replaced batteries and did everything we could to fix it. We contacted the manufacturer who said they had no technical support for this item and that we should return it to where we got it. When we contacted Amazon about getting a replacement, we were informed that they no longer had the item. My only choice was to return the item and get a credit and buy it elsewhere. I was only successful finding it on the internet for 3 times the original price. So instead of returning my son's main Christmas gift, I am stuck with a defective gift that I paid $60 for."
5,Tubes for Percussionist,"The packaging on this product is crazy; you don't find out you have to undo the bottom screws until you already have the package open somehow. ;-) Besides that, this is a lot of fun, with lots of different ways to use/be creative with it. I got it for an adult who is getting into percussion, not a kid, and he seemed really intrigued (we've seen the Blue Man Group)."
2,Loved it but it died,"My 5-year-old loved this toy but it has completely died. Sad because he thought it was great fun. E-mails to the customer service listed in the manual bounce and it's way too expensive to buy a replacement.We did also have a huge laugh because it was near impossible to remove from the packaging. Directions were INSIDE the box when we finally got it open (no joke, it took at least 30 minutes, a phillips screwdriver and lots of patience)."
3,"Before Syngenor, there was...","...Scared to Death. Yes many people today do not know that the better known monster romp Syngenor (out now by Synapse films) is actually a sequel to this film made 9 years before in 1981.The plot is simple. Scared to Death has a Syngenor creature on the loose in a city killing people. It's low budget yet entertaining in a B-movie way. Director William Malone (House on Haunted Hill, Feardotcom) does what he can with the story and his creature design (as he is also a gifted artist) is phenomenal for the budget. If enjoy watching obscure, B-movie romps from the 70's and 80's then you should find enjoyment in this.Other than the awful new cover-art which makes looks like a modern direct-to-video/made-for-Sci Fi Channel drek (The world Syngenor was added to the cover to make a connection to it's sequel) , this DVD is tops. A nice 16x9 widescreen transfer and an interview with director William Malone."
4,THE HEART OF THE MATTER,"LETS GET RIGHT TO THE HEART OF THE MATTER HERE. THIS MOVIE IS REALLY REALLY GRAINY. THE TRANSFER LOOKS ABSOLUTELY TERRIBLE. EVERY SCRATCH AND CRACK IS SEEN IN INTENSE DETAIL HERE. AND ANY SCENE IN THE DARK IS ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO SEE WITHOUT TURNING UP THE BRIGHTNES ON THE TELEVISION. BUT, ON THE POSITIVE SIDE THIS MOVIE HAS BEEN OUT OF PRINT FOR SOME TIME AND ANY TRUE FAN OF THE HORROR GENRE WILL WANT A COPY ON DVD NO MATTER WHAT. THE ACTING IS ACTUALLY QUITE GOOD AND THE PLOT ALTHOUGH THIN ISNT THAT BAD OF AN IDEA. IT WRAPS UP RATHER QUICKLY BUT STILL SEEMS REASONABLY FEASABLE. CONSIDERING THE PRICE ITS VERY EASY TO OVERLOOK THE VISUAL FAULTS. ITS STILL WATCHABLE AND IS STILL ONE OF THE BETTER HORROR/MONSTER FLICKS FROM THE 80'S, EVEN THOUGH IT LOOKS 10 YEARS OLDER."
2,For Completists Only,"Not a greatest hits collection but yet another roundup of old demos & live numbers that have been circulating for years. Disc 2 has a few items I'd never heard before, but fans new to the Soft Machine should steer clear of this. (Buy their first 3 albums instead.)"
2,Not all good advice!,"I have to say, not all the advice in this book is very good. For example, the author gives tests on how to test your dogs personality. One of the tests is to see if your dog is ""hand shy."" To do this, he says that you should take a rolled-up newspaper, or your hand and pretend to hit your dog!! Why would you do this? I think that's an excellent way to get bit.Also, a lot of the advice is obvious, even if you have never owned a dog before. Save your money and get a book that's better written. Victoria Stillwell's book may be a good place to look..."
2,"Good basic information, outdated training techniques","This book has a lot of useful information about puppy development and personality - but it recommends the choke-chain leash-correction training approach, which has been abandoned by many dog trainers. Setting up situations so the puppy gets it right and is then rewarded is much more humane than jerking the poor little one around."
4,Good Solid Construction - Very Cute,My 20 month old daughter loves this set. She can get herself on and off the chairs without falling. The chairs are of strong enough construction that anyone can join her for a tea party and safely sit on the solid chairs. My only problem with this set is that I have not found a way to obtain additional chairs. We would love to have 4 chairs instead of just 2.
2,"Nice try, bad execution","Some years ago, I bought the first edition of this book because, at first glance, it seemed to present a readable discussion of a very difficult subject. However, as I read further, I realized that the writing is very terse and imprecise. Most annoyingly, it was full of typographical errors.This semester I am working with two students on an independent study project on vibration and sound. We decided to use the second edition of this book as one of our sources. To my complete amazement and dismay, the second edition has at least as many typographical errors as the first edition. It is incredibly frustrating to spend half an hour trying to justify an equation, only to realize that ""x"" should be ""y"", or ""less than"" should be ""greater than"", or ""sin"" should be ""cos"".I can recommend this book only if you know enough about the subject to realize what the authors actually meant to say, despite what is written in the book."
5,A little Biased,"I happen to be a brand new graduate student of one of the people who furnished a chapter for this book, Steven de Belle. Because of that I have to confess that I am a little biased. However, I have used this book almost as a bible for my research. It is well written and organized in a convenient manner. If you are currently involved in olfaction research or want to get started I highly recommend this book. It is still very current information and I have found no errors so far. Thanks for your time."
5,sam and max,if you have played any of the previous sam and max games and loved them than this is the same as the rest and just as enjoyobull
4,"Fun once, but not much more than that....","This game is ESPECIALLY fun to play. With its witty dialogue, creepy characters, and (ahem) unique qituations, this game is not one to miss. If one wanted to, they could go to [...] and play the latest episodes, but I prefer to wait to buy the full season. I found myself speaking in the mannerisms of Sam while playing this; thankfully if has passed ;-). It wont have you glued to your computer forever [the only downside with investigative games], but it will certainly hold your attention for a few days.While not a game to play forever, give it to your friends when done. They'll get a good bunch of laughs from it.P.S.-When playing this game remember; BE EVIL. Picking the mean or evil choices is almost ALWAYS the right choice."
3,"Fun for the Novice, Way too simple for the experienced","If you're a veteran of the old-time Sierra classics like Space Quest, Hero's Quest, and Police Quest, or some of the newer in the genre such as The Longest Journey and Grim Fandango then you are most likely going to like this game, but not love it. Why? Because the puzzles are way too easy.Each episode will last from one to one and a half hours, and the puzzles are so shallow that short of missing something you were supposed to pick up, you won't have any trouble figuring out what to do next.The voice acting's OK, and the humor is simple but entertaining and won't appeal to everyone."
1,Lame and irritating,"I bought this game based on the positive reviews, but I'm not sure I'm playing the same game as the other reviewers. The dialog is lame, annoying, and repetitive, not funny. Sponge Bob is funnier than this game. The puzzles are neither challenging nor interesting. If you like Myst or Syberia, you will not like this. I only could stand to play it through the first episode and beginning of the second before I decided to uninstall. Very disappointing."
2,Not so hot...,"I love John Waters, but I didn't care for these stories.... the narrator is has an irritating voice. I didn't even watch them all."
5,Workbook t accompany Puntos de partida: An Invitation to Spanish,This was a new edition workbook I needed for a college class and our bookstore was out. I recieved my order in under one week. The wookbook is very helpful and a requirement for my class.
5,"EXELLENT, HELPFUL WORKBOOK",Excellent workbook to accomany your learning of Spanish. Very clear in English how to proceed. The seller sent me a pristine book.
2,Disappointing,"This workbook is expensive with poor activities. While most of the work corresponds with the chapter work, the directions are in spanish, so if you cant figure out what the directions say your stuck.I just dont feel this is quality material."
3,slow shipping,I ordered this book 2 weeks ago and still have not received it although it says it has shipped. this has happened to me twice now.
5,Puntos de Partida Workbook,This book was delivered to me very quickly and in extremely good shape. I would buy books again!!! I had a very good experience.
1,Workbook to accompany textbook,"This workbook was recommended to accompany the most recent edition of my Spanish Textbook (which I also ordered from Amazon). My professor required that we purchase the workbook, however the one Amazon recommended was not the correct workbook edition. I had to go through a lot of trouble and wasted a great amount of time and money by returning the books to Amazon and having to purchase them in a package from my local textbook store."
3,Workbook to Accompany Puntos De Parida,This is a good workbook for reinforcing the materials in the textbook. There are different drills and interesting exercises to help learning Spanish.
3,Cute but expensive,My 7 year old thought they were cool; I just thought they were expensive for the number that you get. Next time we will buy another cheaper ball.
4,OXO Compact Stainless Steel Dish Rack,The dish rack is the perfect size for our awkward kitchen. Because of the layout of the kitchen sink with some funky angles we couldn't use a conventional dish rack from one of those mega-box stores. I searched and searched and finally ran into this dish rack. Love it!
5,Great for our RV,Needed a dish rack that held enough but didn't take up a great deal of space either while in use or when being stored. This does both and looks good too.
5,A Riveting Search for a Missing Father,"Nora Eisenberg's first book, The War at Home, exploded with humor and vivid characters and earned this wildly original author a dedicated following as well as critical acclaim. With Just the Way You Want Me, she tells the story of Betsy Ross Vogel, a 40 year old journalist who is strangely stuck at a crossroads in life. She's involved with the perfect man and about to get married, but is haunted by a tragic childhood. Betsy is the daughter of one Sam Vogel, a magnetic political leader who was persecuted by the FBI during the McCarthy era, and hounded - Betsy believes - to his death. She gives up everything to make a suspenseful and heartbreaking journey across the U.S. - a quest that takes her into the dark heart of American history and forces her to confront the unfinished mystery of her own past. Riveting and unforgettable, with many chilling insights into the current political climate."
5,Just the Way You Want Me,"Nora Eisenberg's new novel, Just the Way You Want Me, is a fascinating study of family relationships within the context of political repression in the 50s and 60s. It's a novel about memory and longing for acceptance. The main character, Betsy Vogel's quest to find her father is also a quest for belonging--to a family, a community--something which, because of her father's involvement in progressive politics, she had never experienced. I found the novel dramatically compelling, suprising, mysterious but also remarkably prescient, considering our country today, with the Patriot Act and other attempts to curtail our civil liberties. In that way, the novel is a history lesson, one we all need to learn from."
4,Thinking outside the jewelry box!,"This book is all that it is supposed to be...fun, fast, and funky! Margot Potter has a sparkling personality that shines through in her off the wall designs. She doesn't take herself nor jewelry making too seriously and that is why it is so much fun to read this book. Even if you don't make all the designs in the book you can't help but be inspired by her infectious style. It also helps you to see outside of the jewelry box and think about things that aren't meant for jewelry in a whole new light. Both this book and the follow up books are worth having in your personal library no matter what type of jewelry you like to design. Ms Potter brings a lot of fun to an age-old art and challenges us all to be inspired by the mundane ordinary things around us."
2,Cute Designs-Inaccurate Supply Lists,"This book has great ideas for necklace and bracelet designs. The only thing you need to be aware of is this: her list of what you need for each project is not accurate. For example, the grey scale necklace on page 48 calls for 74 pearls. You actually need about 74 for each of the four strings."
4,impatient beader had an impatient editor,"This books is full of really fun projects which I cannot wait to do. However, it's also riddled with typos--especially on the quantity and colors of beads you need so pay attention!!!! I'm working on Mermaid's Bounty and if you follow the instructions, you'll have 120 beads left over."
5,Groovy and Fun,"Here are the top five reasons why I love The Impatient Beader and why it has a prominent place on my bookshelf:1. Margot has a terrific eye for color. The projects use unusual combinations that look great together. When I get stuck in a color rut, I can just flip through the pages.2. The projects are quick and trendy. Plus, they use beads that are easy to find.3. There's a good combination of basic stringing projects and designs that incorporate other techniques like knotting, easy wire work and unusual ways to use beading wire.4. The supplies/tools chapter is comprehensive and the introductory techniques are explained thoroughly. Beginners will refer to these sections again and again.5. The writing is witty and fun. My husband laughed out loud while reading some of the project introductions. We left it on the dining room table for a week so we could read all of the text. Now that's saying something!"
2,I didn't like it,"To me this movie was a pure waste of time. I suggest that if you want to see this movie, rent it. Don't waste money on it like i did."
3,Word Smart is Wonderful....Grammar Smart is Not So Wonderful,"The WORD SMART portion of this set is really good. The speakers are pleasant, it moves at a good pace, and the examples are entertaining. However, the GRAMMAR SMART portion of this set is not so good. The speakers (different than those doing Word Smart) are so ridiculous, I had to stop listening after 30 minutes. I was so put off by the incredibly stupid jokes and the blatant reading of a script, that it was too annoying to try to pay attention to the important stuff. The set is definitely worth it for Word Smart, since it is 4 of the 6 CDs in the set. Actually, I think they sell Word Smart all on its own, so that would be a better choice."
4,Lots of Fun Information,"Kids will enjoy learning about the differences between chimps and apes along with a variety of other monkey facts. Colorful pages include true-false questions and ""Can you find...?"" pictures to encourage active participation beyond just reading. However, I feel the designated reading level is inaccurate. The reading level is more appropriate for 2nd and 3rd graders. Some words and concepts include primates, prehensile, brachiating, agile, bonding and ranking. There is a glossary for italicized words but not all of the above words are included. One statement in the book I find too much of a stretch. ""Some monkeys wear makeup."" is used to introduce the naturally colorful face of the male Mandrill. Also I wish the answers to the true-false questions were elsewhere than right underneath. The child doesn't have time to think about it with the answer right there. Even with these reservations I highly recommend this book."
3,Good theory but not a page turner,"Lipson lays out a compelling argument for the contracting advantage of democracies leading to more peaceful relations among them. Contrary to a previous review, he does present good reasons why elected leaders can't just toss everything their predecessors did out the window (e.g. constitutional constraints, reciprocality, etc.) and explains that, even when they manage to, the public debate has given other states fair warning to adjust policy. That said, the overall quality of the writing could have been a bit better, being on the dry, repetitive side, and he would have done well to get another proofreader. Just don't expect this to be one of those books you can't put down."
2,The Joy of Soy,"I found the recipes tasty, but there is no nutritional information for any of the recipes. I will probably not use this book very often because of this."
1,No joy in soy-ville,"I'm going to have to throw in a dissenting opinion here--I can't recommend this book because most soy foods are NOT REALLY GOOD FOR YOU! The only soy foods that are truly nutritious are the properly fermented ones: tempeh, miso, natto, shoyu and tamari. (A ""Joy of Soy"" cookbook built around these 5 only would be great!) ALL OTHER SOYFOODS contain numerous anti-nutrients...they just aren't good for you. My advice is to contact the Weston A. Price Foundation (www.westonaprice.org) and get a copy of ""The Ploy of Soy,"" by Sally Fallon."
1,Huge and Cheaply made,"I ordered the medium (smallest size available) and it looks like it could fit and extra large person. The costume material arrives wrinkled with instructions for a cool iron, but it feels like some kind of plastic material that could not withstand even the coolest iron. I did not wear this for Halloween nor would I suggest anyone else to purchase."
4,A Delightful Collection of Covers,"I was just given this album by my mother for Christmas, and while I might not have thought to buy it for my self, I'm certainly glad someone else did. I might have liked it even more had Williams strayed a little farther from the original arrangements, but I understand his reasons for not doing so, and it's a minor quibble at best. What I can't fault at all is his interpretation, especially on ""Reason To Believe"" and ""Games People Play,"" which I've never particularly liked before, as well as on others like ""Crying In The Rain"" and ""If You Could Read My Mind."" Not quite a classic, and maybe not representative of Williams, but well worth repeated listening."
2,Ill-conceived CD is no treat for a Don Williams fan.,"Eagerly we tore off the plastic wrap, popped the newly arrived CD of ""Borrowed Tales"" into the player, and settled back for a treat from our favorite singer. Sad to say, that's not what we got. I never thought I would wince to hear Don Williams sing, but this new CD is a painful experience. I couldn't bear to listen to it more than once. He has always prided himself, and justly so, on the careful way he chooses and arranges his songs. I don't know who got to him this time, but it was no friend who convinced him that recording ""Fever"" was a good idea. If my memory from one listening is correct, he has done nothing to make the songs his own; it's almost as if he were singing along with the original recording. Wrong tempo for him, wrong phrasing, wrong tone."
4,Solid basic tool,"Works as advertised, will fit pretty easily in most brake calipers to push back pistons. One thing to watch out for is that it does not have a rotating face, so a threaded rear piston for e-brakes will still be a pain in the rear, no pun intended. For the price? Worth it."
4,Works!,This made retracing the brake piston a breeze. Made changing my brakes much easier. I highly recommend this product for brake jobs.
4,"Worked great, but still needed C clamp.","Once I removed the calipers from the vehicle, I was able to insert this tool with an old pad and fully compress the cylinder. I did need to open the bleeder valve to let a little fluid out in order to get them to compress easily. Unfortunately, I couldn't remove the caliper until partially compressing the cylinder as the cylinder was catching on the rivets on the back of the old pads. So I needed to loosen the bolts on the caliper and use a c-clamp to pull the caliper forward so I could compress the cylinder enough to remove the caliper. It would be nice if there was a way to use this tool in a case such as this as well."
4,Lisle brake pad spreader,"Makes retracting the piston into the caliper for disc brake pad replacement easy, and helps to do so evenly, preventing damage to the piston. Get one of these, forget about C-clamps."
2,Lower your prices!!!!,What a rip-off!! Do you expect anyone to buy a wrestling tape for 50.98 or 38.99!!!! It's stupid!!! I go to Suncoast and I bought Starrcade'93 for what? 12.33$! Listen if you want any costumers I suggest you lower your prices!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
4,prices,i don't get it your wwf video's are 16.99 and wcw are what 50.00 60.00 dollars IF YOU LOWER YOUR PRICES LIKE 16.99 YOU WILL MAKE A LOT OF MORE MONEY AND A LOT OF MORE CUSTOMERS . THINK ABOUT IT
4,WCW Bash at the Beach'97,"This was probably the best Bash at the Beach ever with a great card. It started off with an ok tag team match between Glacier & Earnest Miller vs. Wrath & Mortis. Here is the rest of the card: Chono & Muta vs. Steiner Bros., Chris Jericho vs. Ultimo Dragon, a six-man Lucha Libre tag match that was very exciting, Chris Benoit vs. Kevin Sullivan(career match), Jeff Jarrett vs. Steve McMichael, Scott Hall & Randy Savage vs. Diamond Dallas Page & Curt Hennig, Roddy Piper vs. Ric Flair, and the main event was Lex Luger & Giant vs. Hollywood Hogan & Dennis Rodman."
2,"Nice coffee table book, not useful for learning",This book was required as a textbook and I must say that it was totally useless as an educational resource. The book spends way much time on annecdotal facts and little time giving you guidance on how to approach Fuzzy/ Neural network theory or designs
5,Fascinating - not dry reading at all,"You have to love a book with a title like this. You might think a book about allergies and plant sex would be dull, but Ogren's writing style is lively and he knows how to convey information in a fun way. I wish he'd been my science teacher in high school! Everyone who's thinking about doing some landscaping, or has allergies, should read this. I know it's made me think more carefully about what I plant."
5,More than a story,"This short story about an inquisitive, intelligent, and wayward young man proves to be both an exciting and educational read. The story line and its characters are captivating, yet an unexpected wealth of history is also included. I learned much about nuclear energy and its history that I was never aware of before reading this book."
2,"Amazing kid, betrayed by writer","I agree with ""Umm...yeah"". I saw this book reviewed by TIME mag and thought it looked like a good read. Unfortunately I felt allot like this kid as a child and resented the writer's condescending tone towards his subject and wondered if David had any idea he would be treated like this in the book. I think it is amazing what David accomplished and sad that the writer spent so little time talking about it. Instead he uses it as a anti-nuclear forum and and somehow equates poor spelling on David's part as an indication of his lack of sophistication. I enjoyed the background history on atomic power even though it reminded me on how I used to fill in my reports in high-school. I couldn't help but wonder how David has turned out now. I hope he is still living an adventure. I would recommend this book but be aware the writer did not do justice to the subject."
3,"Good story, bad anti-scout, anti-nuke slant","As both an Eagle Scout, Scout leader, and working in the commercial nuclear energy field, I felt that the book had a very anti-scout and anti-nuclear slant.The story of David Hahn, minus the anti-scout and anti-nuclear slant, was good. It shows that the current eduction system does not look for a student that excels in one particular area, but teach to the ""average"" student."
2,Read the Article and Save the Money,"Having read the original article, I genuinely looked forward to the book. I was expecting something new or at least more in depth. Alas, it was not to be.Aside from a bit more technical detail and basic physics there is nothing to recommend this book over the original article. The article is far better written and more intersting than the book.It was amusing to try and follow the author's attempt to fabricate a dark polt between the AEC and the Boy Scouts by dragging in everthing from Hitler to Werner Von Braun. That and a tiring littany of every significant nuclear accident since World WW II added little to the book except extra pages.As the title says, save your money and read the original article. It's also quicker."
2,Good story ruined by the author's editorializing,"This is an interesting read, but it's made nearly intolerable by the author's trashing of the boy scouts (and of nuclear energy, which I understand is a little more deserving). It could have been done a lot better."
5,OUTSTANDING !!!,EXTREMELY WELL PRESENTED. USES FACTS TO LET US DRAW OUR CONCLUSIONS. I BOUGHT TWO COPIES TO SHARE. GETTING GREAT FEEDBACK FROM THOSE THAT HAVE SEEN IT. WORTH YOUR TIME. MAKES A SPECIAL GIFT.
1,omg do people swallow anything.,This guy might be a little entertainging to watch but if you are really looking for the truth where scunce backs up claims then google Nassim Haramein - Science behind the Unified Field.Also videos like 'the secret' and 'what the #$%# do we know' are much better.
3,"""The Everything Review""","The reason spirituality is so difficult and differently defined is because it is simply the right contemplation and right use of everything else. This is not to deny any particularity in religious thought and practice, but it is to move to a much broader and relevant field of explication. There is no religious/non-religious dichotomy per se, which is not to say that traditional pieties and responsibilities are wiped out by everything's significance; they survive within this."
1,"Poorly set out, incomplete info, many errors!","I was hoping this book would ease my introduction to MiniCad, but instead I found it omits many important steps for a supposed walk-through type tutorial book. e.g. often does not clarify when a click or double-click is necessary to complete an action. The diagrams are very poorly labelled, and there are some obvious errors when referring to the program's menus/toolbars etc. too. I found it incredibly frustrating trying to work through this book, and was very disappointed considering there are so few books on MiniCad on the market."
5,Great cleats,Comfortable. Don't slip on hard or soft fields. Work well with artificial turf. Light. This pair of cleats is still going strong!
5,Pry it out of my cold dead hands!,"I've had a 12"" iBook G4 since 2005 and it's still my favorite notebook for browsing the internet, writing letters, and even reading pdf's. It's very lightweight and I consider the screen the perfect size. It's held up very well. One of the keys has a hairline crack and one of the rubber feet on the bottom fell off but I clean it every month or so and it still looks almost new.My only criticism is that it gets a little warm so I keep it on top of a clipboard when holding it in my lap. No viruses, no crashes, no worries.When netbooks started becoming popular a couple of years ago, I had to laugh because I already have a lightweight, handy netbook. In fact, I'm using it right now to write this review. Given a choice between a new Asus or Dell netbook or a used iBook G4 for the same price, I would take the G4 without thinking about it for a second."
2,Grrrrr,"So I got the laptop and its a good thing I double checked everything before I gave it to my sis (she needed something she could take to school with her for minor projects and such) because it came with what must have been a different laptops charger. It wasn't even close to being able to plug in.. A laptop isn't much good if you can't charge the battery. Luckily the replacement charger only cost like 7 bucks from a different seller, so problem solved. Buyer beware because you might not get the right parts."
5,Well done!,I'm REALLY enjoying my laptop very much. Now I can go do fun things on this fun iBook of mine for any reasons. Thanks!!!! And I have to take it with me for the rest of my life. YAY! (^-^)
2,It's not for everyone,"There are some interesting notes on the subject of baseball and economics, but there's also a lot of dry stuff along the way. This is of specialized interest."
2,Very poorly made,"For the price, I wasn't expecting much... but the other reviews had my hopes high. Sadly, I am very disappointed. The strap is nearly falling off and the top is a thin paper... I purchased this for my 3 year old - she LOVES carrying around things and playing ""drums,"" but she'll break this within 5 minutes."
3,Coin Sort- of and Counting Machine,"This machine sorts coins fairly well but does not do a good job of counting them. When a coin holder becomes full the excess of coins are dumped out the back of the machine, however the counter still continues to add them to the total amount. The volume of coins added must also be regulated carefully or it will jam up. I found that by opening up the coin drawer and inserting the coins manually was just as easy as going through the frustration of running the machine. When a coin holder becomes full the exact amount of that denomination is reached. This makes possible for a person to see if the correct amount has been dumped into a particular tube. It would probably be just as easy and more economical to puchase this drawer alone from the manufacturer."
1,Looks Good - Works Terrible,"I really thought I was getting the real thing when I bought this sorter. It was electric and seemed to have the mechanism necessary to finally keep my coins organized and ready for sorting and rolling prior to depositing. I had used it for months before realizing that most of the coins I had deposited had gone into the back area where rejects go and had piled up on the table. I opened the top and found out that the sorter was easily jammed and it wasn't going to work with anything heavier than a penny or dime. In essence, this was a useless piece of garbage. Don't waste your money!"
1,Useless Sorting Machine,"Half an hour after purchasing this sorting machine, went home plugged it into the outlet it worked for five minutes then it stopped. The coins were not going into thier proper slots, they were all over the place, and they were getting caught all the time. I spent more time clearing the machine than packing away coins. Then it started to smell as if something was burning and the adapter overheated. I had to throw the machine into the recycle bin.I called the company and explained the problem that I was having to them, they sent me a new machine the next day, and it too had the same problem. I had to throw that into the recycling bin too. This sorting machine is useless. A waste of time."
1,Broke on First Use,I got this same model and brand at a big box store and it broke on the first use. The motor just quit working. During that first use it had 3 jams. This seems to be a faulty product and I am wondering if only super expensive models worked. I took this back but only got a store credit.Buyer Beware.
1,CRAP - do not buy!,"Item is crap, nothing more I can say about it. The customer service I received from the company was also crap. I do NOT recommend buying from them. Stay away. -CPG"
1,Garbage,"Coins just fall to the back, not accurate, breaks easily when you try to fix it. I would not recommend."
1,Thumbs Down,"You have to shake the machine for the coins to get processed... coins fall into the wrong chamber... it doesn't know when the chambers are full, so it'll continue to process the coins until it starts to overflow and jams up the machine..."
4,Digital Coin Sorter,"Digital coin sorter worked well for my purposes. Only drawback was that occasionally coins would miss the overflow bin, and end up in otherparts of the machine which would result in drawer jams."
1,"THIS IS NOT THE TV SERIES ""TARZAN"" WITH TRAVIS FIMMEL","THIS IS NOT THE TV SERIES ""TARZAN"" WITH TRAVIS FIMMEL.It has yet to appear in the DVD format.....Hollywood studios....customers are waiting.......do you care????Wherever Amazon.com got their information for this disc, it is totally WRONG."
3,Inside old Hollywood,"""Souls for Sale(1923)"" was a lost, forgotten film for a long time. It's quite a juvenile story of a young woman lost in Hollywood with a creep husband(Eleanor Boardman and Lew Cody). But this is well worth seeing for anyone interested in old Hollywood history. Included are scenes of Erich von Stroheim filming ""Greed"" at MGM studios(a year before it became MGM), and Charile Chaplin filming ""A Woman of Paris"". This movie flopped because it had no scenes with Charlie Chaplin. You also see snippits of directors Fred Niblo and Marshall Neilan. ""Souls for Sale"" co-stars the very lovely Barbara LaMarr, the first big star to die from drug-related problems. Married several times, and an all-night party-girl, LaMarr's career soared based on her vampish beauty. She retired to Europe. In poor health, she died in 1926, after completing 30 films. She was 29 years old."
1,Spelt is wheat; whey is dairy - don't trust the ingredients here!,"This book isn't up to its title. Some of the recipes with ""whey protein powder"" have a ""publisher's update"" to use ""soy-based protein powder"" instead, but don't mention why (whey is dairy). Plus, yogurt is an optional ingredient.Spelt is a type of wheat, and recipes use spelt flour. Yikes!We believe that soy that hasn't been fermented is not a healthy food (more info at mercola.com), and this book uses a lot of processed soy. Similar: canola oil. Also, the primary sweetener is xylitol, and we believe stevia to often be a healthier choice (from Dr. J. V. Wright's Nutrition & Healing)._The Joy of Cooking_ has lots of dairy-free, wheat-free recipes, without false promises."
3,Just so-so,"I was hoping for a cookbook that had a lot of recipes I could use. Unfortunately there were very few in here that the average person would eat. I'd give better examples, but I gave it away to a friend. To touch on the dairy free wheat free examples. I don't believe this was written by a person who has celiac or is lactose intolorant. I may be wrong. It appears to be an eating your way clean, which is what the title says. So, it is to detoxify your body. It does have stickers in the cookbook to ask to replace the whey with soy products and spelt can be tolorated by many people who can't have wheat. I CAN eat spelt, not wheat. My husband CAN'T have any gluten. There is a difference. If your problem is JUST wheat...it might not be an issue, if it is gluten, don't eat spelt! Always check with your dr..... I was looking for a gluten free/dairy free cookbook. With this being a CLEAN eating book......the recipes were not overly appetizing."
1,Good coffee - Poor quality,"I bought the Presto after reading many reviews and after 8 months of owning it here's what I think:Yes, it makes great coffee. Perfect brewing - never had better at home.Yes, it smells like plastic at first but it went away quickly.Yes, the timer is incredibly cheap....and despite reading this in other reviews I bought it anyway. No problems until yesterday.....it died. The timer completely fizzled out and it's integrated with the whole on/off mechanism so no more Presto. Luckily, my intuition told me to keep my old maker on a shelf in the basement. 8 year-old Braun that makes crappy coffee....but it still works. I won't buy another Presto again.It felt cheap coming out of the box and despite making great coffee it's poor quality won the argument."
5,great coffee,this coffee maker makes a great cup of coffee. i've tried a half dozen different ones over the years and this is the best. the price is hard to beat and it brews coffee as quickly and tastefully as any out there. highly recommended.
4,Hot delicious coffee for a year,"This coffeemaker delivers hot delicious coffee, and comes in a sleek contemporary design. I have owned two of these coffeemakers and both have lasted less than a year. I will probably buy a third and make sure it comes with an extended warranty. Why? It just makes the best coffee ever...I just don't think I could go back to lukewarm mediocre coffee."
2,good while it lasts,good product but died after six months. i agree with other neg reviews that pot drips at spout and l.e.d. read out is designed for 20/20 without glasses vision. the big plus is it's fast and hot brew. i wouldn't buy it again.
2,Excellent - until it broke.,"This made beautiful coffee, until suddenly it just stopped working. Customer service was not helpful."
4,"Actually ""Brews"" Coffee","I've had no plastic taste problem with mine as others have had. This has been a terrific coffee maker - actually, the best I've ever owned. Wish it made 12 cups though..."
3,form and function with a catch,"Bottom line: you get what you pay for. I bought this machine about a year ago after thoroughy searching for an attractive coffee maker that also got great reviews. As people have already stated, this machine does an excellent job at maximizing the taste of the coffee it brews--I never noticed a difference in good tasting coffee vs. great tasting coffee until I used the presto coffee maker. Now here is why I gave it three stars: the thing died on me after about a year of ownership, and i have a feeling that going through the hassle of getting it repaired would probably equal or top what I paid for it ($35)."
1,Don't bother,"I read the reviews for this and was swayed to order it. Bad choice.Main issues with this coffee maker:1. Very cheap looking2. ALWAYS drips when pouring a cup of coffee.3. Carafe is too small to put your hand in, so washing requires using a wooden spoon handle to push the sponge around...4. No beep to tell you the coffee is done.5. It stopped working in less than a year."
3,"good design, up to a point","This coffee maker is attractive and saves space, but some of its features are irksome. The clock and water gauge are difficult to read. When filling the tank, I have to hold the water bottle in my left hand to be able to see the gauge, and the red marker rises slowly, so I have to pour in stages or I end up with too much water (the opening to the tank is so narrow, you can't scoop out the excess). The coffee pot itself has a narrow opening, making it difficult to clean. Despite claims to the contrary, I don't see an improvement in flavor. In its favor, it is quiet (my last one beeped a lot) and while some of the other features I had before were nice, I don't miss them in this one. The manual said to use paper no. 4 filters, but my old gold filter fits. It turns off automatically after two hours, and keeps the coffee hot until then."
4,Great Coffee - Bad Switches,"This is, by far, the best coffee maker I have owned. The coffee is simply delicious, and kept warm at just the perfect temperature.That said, I just ordered my third Presto in two years. My previous machines both had a bad ""on"" switch, so that the start cycle quit working. Perhaps I'm a little tough on my machines, but I really doubt it. More likely, the switches are on the cheap side, and I would be willing to bet that more than a few others have had this problem as well. Too bad, because otherwise this machine is simply fantastic.Still, when the switch on my second machine quit, I quickly ordered another Presto. We've tried many others (Krups, Braun, etc.) but none make as good a cup as (this quirky little) Presto.If you don't mind replacing it on a fairly regular basis, it's a definite buy!"
1,Dead after a year,"Sigh.... I researched and researched and researched and I came up with this coffeemaker as the GOAT (Greatest of All Time). It was the little things at first- the hot plate under the cofee carafe started peeling. It had been black. Then as it chipped and chipped it turned silver. It could still make a cup of coffee. It just wasn't pretty. I was willing to soldier on. Alas, this morning it died. Not even a year after purchasing it. My last coffee maker had been some cheapo $20 thing that I dragged cross country and only died because I thought it might be a good idea to immerse it in water to clean it. Look- everyone has lapses in judgment. That was mine. So anyway- I didn't even do that to this coffee maker. So now I have to find another one. Sigh...."
4,PLASTIC ODOR PROBLEM? HERE'S THE ANSWER,"I just received this item and like it a lot. It makes delicious, very hot coffee Fast. Has (or had) 2 problems: you can't fit your hand inside the top to clean it and the coffee had a plastic odor.For the lst problem: I put a drop of liquid soap inside with a HandiWipe dish cloth, put in some hot water and shake. Second problem: wad up some newspapers and push down inside the water holder up to the top; leave overnight. Next day: no more plastic smell. It doesn't drip At All."
2,Had a horrific smell that wouldn't go away.,"I purchase this coffee maker because I heard that it's brewing tempature was almost unmatched (except by very pricey machines). However, I has also heard that there were some ""bad batches"" that had a terrible plastic/glue smell. I got one of the bad ones. After brewing water through about 20 times, and vinager a couple times - the smell would not go away. So, I was left with no choice but to return it. Bummer too, because for $35.99, that was a steal. Hope others have better luck."
1,"Splitter-splatter, metallic taste and odor","Very leaky interface between filter holder and carafe. We ran many water-only batches but strange 'metallic' flavor did not to dissipate. Thought it was the brass filter, switched to paper and the metallic taste was still there. We worried like other users it might be a health risk. On month of use and now returning it."
1,I hate this coffee maker,"I have never written a review before, but I feel compelled to write one now. I hate this coffee maker. I don't think I have ever used the word hate when referring to an appliance, but I really hate it. First of all, it leaks. It sputters when making coffee and when you open it up to clean it, the grounds are stuck to the top and they get all over the place. It always looks gross and now it is dead. I really can't expend any more energy complaining about this ridiculous machine, I'm off to find a new one. I just feel the need to tell the world not to buy it."
2,Makes a Mess,"We recieved this product as a gift, and while serching for a replacement I was suprised to see how highly rated this coffee maker is. It took months of use before the coffee we brewed lost this strange styrofome taste, and that was even after multiple vinegar runs and clean caf run throughs. Then it started to only brew half a pot, or three quarters of a pot, or a quarter of a pot. Now it has stopped doing that, mysteriously, and now it spits and spaters everywhere and leaks all over the place unless you have the pot perfectly placed in a magical spot. To bad- we loved how small it is, but I can't handle one more messy clean up before my morning coffee!!!"
5,Very nice,"I am very impressed with this coffee maker.The coffee comes out HOT which is a VERY nice thing.The timer is great and very easy to use.I am new to drinking coffee, so I am not very technical in my review...but you get the idea. :)"
3,Beware: this machine takes paper filters!,"Note before you buy that this machine uses only paper filters (#4) and DOES NOT INCLUDE any of these filters with the unit.I sent this to my father for Christmas, and he was shocked that a $70.00 machine would not even include one or two samples of the paper filters just to get you started.He had to run to the grocery and fight the Christmas crowds to search for a #4 paper filter that fits this unit.He was a bit disappointed that Presto chose to take the cheap route by not offering even the smallest accesory with this unit."
4,Great Product... If I could only use it!,"I got this coffee maker as a gift and really do love it. But I broke the carafe and can't seem to find a replacement. Thus, no more good coffee! Any suggestions?"
2,spitter-spatter,"Great tasting and hot coffee from this maker in a sleek design. However, the spitter and spatter from leakage can drive you nuts."
5,Wonderful Coffee Maker,"The Presto Scandinavian Design Coffee Maker has been a wonderful addition to my coffee supplies. It produces wonderful tasting, hot coffee in minutes. I was a little afraid that the larger size would pose a problem for my kitchen space, but because of its slim width, it fits perfectly into a relatively small space. It has really been a great bargain!"
5,Great coffeemaker!!!!!!!,"One thing I noticed especially with this coffeemaker, when you pour your coffee in a cup, it goes in the cup, not all over the counter like others I've used in the past. Wish it was a 12 cup, other than that, it does quite fine. We don't like a lot of gadgets, so don't use the timer part of it, looks nice, clean and simple."
5,Consistantly great tasting coffee,"I am not the cofee drinker.. However, I am now drinking the coffee because it tastes great with this maker. It is at the right temperature, brews less bitter than our other maker and is a dream to clean. I am glad I chose this item and I am sure you will be. It is a good choice if you do not want to spend a lot for a high end machine. Our organic coffee is a nectar with this brewer"
2,I'm starting to hate it,"I'm no coffee snob, but the idea of innovative design in the pursuit of better coffee appealed to me. This coffee maker does make good coffee but really not noticeably better than our previous Krups and Cuisinart units. The reason I am starting to hate the Presto is that, while brewing, coffee will spill over the top of the carafe (onto to the hot plate and counter) if the carafe is not positioned just so. And it is very difficult to determine what the ""just so"" position is. So often its a big mess and a pain."
4,The Mother Lode of Investment Advice!!,"Simply put the BEST doggone book on investment that I have read in a long long time.It is simply scary,funny and down right on target!"
1,Pass on This One,"Worst thing I have bought from Amazon. It is not as nice as a $5.00 cosmetic bag that I have bought at a drugstore. It should not have stated it was a purse. You are paying $50.00 for the small Prada triagle but this could only be considered a cosmetic bag not a purse. The color is also a dirty pink, the picture is much better than reality and I would not recommend it to anyone even if you are buying it because of the brand. There are much better brand products out there for this price."
3,You're paying for the Prada logo,"I ordered this bag for my young sister-in-law because it's the type of bag and the size she would normally carry. It seems to be well constructed. The color is the same (baby?) pink shown on my monitor. It looks like the photo on the web site. However, if not for the Prada logo on it, I don't think I would have paid $50 for a small nylon bag. For a gift to someone who would like Prada I think it's a good idea and it won't break the bank."
2,A cheap bag with the Prada name...,"When I saw the price on this I decided to go for it because of the brand name- just wanted to have something Prada. I must say I was quite disappointed when I received it. The purse is very small and can't hold much at all. The strap isn't big enough to wear over the shoulder, so it needs to be held or worn on the arm. It just doesn't look like a nice quality bag. My biggest complaint of all is the complete lack of inner pockets. It's just the one space with no further divisions or pockets. I say skip it and save your money for a nicer designer purse."
2,too small,didnt know this bag was this small and it also looked used too! Anyways didnt return it but gave it to my daughter who rocked it and then to my maid who rocked it too. Bags like this should be held by models so you know what size it is.
5,Prada bag,"My daughter loves it, is a cute bag for girls. It came with the authenticity document and care instructions. I am happy!"
3,Ok....,"Not a bad cd, he's reminiscent of Keith Richards looks wise...One of the best aspects of the packaging is his picture, which is great for showing your children what drug addiction will do to you.He should have given up singing...I can't figure out what the other reviewers thought was so great about My Funny Valentine...instrumentally it was spot on, but then he began to sing....Only for the hardcore Chet fans, IMHO."
3,Not the best of the series,"This is the second ""What's Michael"" book that I've read aloud for my tween sons. We liked Hard Day's Life much better, and gave it a unanimous 5 stars. This one only merited three stars - even from my son who LOVES cats.The only story in this book that we thoroughly enjoyed was ""A day in the life of the Michael family."" Otherwise, it seemed like the focus was more on the very flawed human characters - criminals, animal beaters, and some that are nice enough but not too bright.I can definitely recommend the series for both adults and older children, but I'd start with another volume."
3,"Pretty good, clock is a little temperamental","I love travel alarm clocks. I use them as my regular alarm clocks. And because I don't wear wristwatches I like to have a little one to carry in my purse, backpack etc. I so liked the design of this one that I bought a few as backups. I kinda wish I hadn't at this point and I'll tell you why.When you push the switch all the way to the right, that's the 'off' alarm position. However, sometimes the alarm icon still shows up regardless and the alarm goes off.Couldn't figure out the problem at first but now I know to push it a few times hard to get it to go off. I only bought this a few months ago so it's still pretty new. I like the design, it works fine as long as I remember to check to make sure that the icon isn't showing up. Or flashing like a ghost which happens sometimes.Maybe if you didn't use it as often as I use mine then it'd be fine. But I use other small travel clocks a lot and have never had this problem before with any of them."
1,unacceptable quality,I've bought two of these. Each worked fine for almost a year. Then each failed to sound its alarm. Their poor quality is nothing if not consistent.
1,Don't bother,"After owning the clock for 2 weeks the ""off"" button quit working. This means it WILL go off everyday without fail even in the ""off"" position. Therefore, I must remember to reset alarm for a much later time on the weekends so it doesn't wake me up at 6:00 as usual. ANNOYING! Sometimes I forget! It also quit failing to snap closed so the whole fold tight for travel feature doesn't work. I won't buy it again even tho' the size and volume (loud) are perfect you can't live long term with the rest."
3,"not bad, but not great for me",This product works pretty well but can not be relied upon by itself to completely clear up oily skin. It should be used with a good moisturizer if it's going to really do it's job well.
4,Good for rotating with regular cetaphil,"I only use this normal to oily formula in summer when my skin is at its most oily and even then I dont use it every day, only on my sweatiest most oily days. On the other days of the week I use my regular cetaphil. In general, for me, the orignal works the best but once in awhile I need something to cut the grease and this is what I find works best for those days. It is not as gentle as the original but still better than other products formulated for normal to oily skin on the market."
3,Oily skin?,"You might not like this product if you have oily skin, since we ""people with oily skin"" are used on using products that would make our skin dry to dry out pimples and such.. this product leaves a satin finish on your skin, and i found that my nose gets oily after couple of hours, i did not like that. However it is a good cleanser, it cleans makeup without having to rub it too hard on your face like other soups. it also smells like Johnson&Johnson baby shampoo."
4,Not for acne,Iv have been using this product for a little over a year at first it worked well but for the past 3 months it has stopped working.Im in my late 20's and I break out about a week before my period and when it touch my face while on computer ect.I dont feel very clean after I use it witch I have to wash my face in the shower about 3 times to feel like it even cleaned a little(so I go threw it fast).I think it would be very good for no acne prone sensitve skin it is gentle it foams up a little and the smell is very faint and the price is very good.I am now on the hunt for a new face wash.
2,What about the phone function,Was a long time palm supporter but now I would trade it all for something that works - Have not been happy with any of their smart(?) phones - too many things to go wrong - The 700p is great for surfing the web but as a phone I am almost better off with two tin cans and a string!
3,Nice Phone but don't expect the rebate!,"Pros:Very good voice quality.Has all sorts of PDA gadgets that work well (Calender, contact lists, etc.)Camera quality is good.Speaker on the phone works well.Internet browser is amazing to have for restaurant lookup or quick directions.Cons:Sprint will not give you the $150 mail in rebate when you purchase the phone from amazon.com because they already include the rebate in the price.The Sprint Customer Support is not forthright with information; you have to dig into them in order to get answers to your questions.Bluetooth is not reliable and hard to configure."
1,Needs rebooting almost every day. Terrible support.,"I had great hopes for this device, and when it works, it's great. But it seems to have been rushed out the door given the number and type of bugs. I have to reboot it almost every day, and certainly almost every time I try to ""really use it"", as in making several calls in rapid succession, switching applications, etc. Support is horrible, a badly needed firmware update is nowhere in sight (Jan 2007). It's a pity that Palm has compromised its reputation for solid, well-tested and well-supported products. I have asked colleagues and many have the same stability problems with this model. Blackberries seem the most stable and even the Windows devices (Q, Cingular 2125) are apparently more stable."
2,SMS is flakey,"I've had this phone for about 5 months, and every few days, the phone decides it doesn't want to receive SMS messages (actually I've had 3 of these phones and they all exhibit this behavior). I've brought it back to the store (only to get a refurb to replace it), and the problem persists. The sprint customer service is clueless. For the price I paid for this phone in addition to the monthly fees, I expect that I would be able to reliably receive SMS messages or get the problem fixed. I tend to believe this is a software glitch and there is no patch for it. Sprint ""customer service"" (and I use the term loosely) has said they'll release a patch this year (and that was in early January). Although I love the palm interface, I'll have to throw this away."
5,"Great for SMS, email and web browsing","If you're a heavy text (SMS) user, email user, or web browser, this is the phone to get in the United States. Fast Internet access, a full keyboard for fast typing, and a touch screen make this the best phone on the market today for serious communicators.Be sure to plan on getting an unlimited data plan because you'll blast through data once you can.Threaded text messages are awesome. Each person you SMS with gets their own thread so you can easily track SMS conversations. Great stuff."
2,Great Phone needs a firmware update,"I upgraded from my much loved Treo 600 and the 700p is an upgrade. It has a superior camera and bluetooth which the 600 lacks.There are some bugs in the 700p's firmware that have gone unresolved. Palm's customer support has acknowledged the problems but has offered no information on if or when the issues will be fixed. Some of the issues that I have found are:1. Receiving an SMS reboots the phone. Not always, but often enough2. Some Bluetooth headset manufacturers are not supporting the 700p because of a ""firmware bug""3. The 700p has a long lag when switching between apps. In some cases it can be as long as 30 seconds. This never happened with the 600.I hope Palm will issue a firmware update that resolves these issues, but until then I would look toward another manufacturer."
2,Treo freezes daily,"I've had the phone for 3 weeks now, the battery does not last more than 1 day but the most frustating aspect is that the systems freezes every day or 2. Usually re-setting fixes it, but if you don't realize it's frozen, then you miss calls. Now it has shut down again, just after re-charging, and does not turn on or re-set so I'm on hold with customer service. It IS user-friendly and i like the screen and access to the internet and email, but the re-setting is a pain and I wouldn't recommend this phone to anyone."
2,Pretty disappointing,"I have owned the Treo 300, 600, 650 and now the 700p, and I am sorry to say that the 700 is likely the last one that I own. I would highly recommend to anyone to check out other products as I find the too to be very glitchy. There can be long delays while switching applications. When the service is looking for a signal, good luck trying to do something else. The phone freezes when it thinks it has a signal. Also, I seem to have to reboot this thing about 2x a week. Also, the voice function is only decent.Palm basically keeps putting out new phones without touching the OS and it's getting stale.Luckily for me, the Apple Iphone and the Blackberry Curve are coming out soon. I will inspect those and hope that they outperform the 700. I can't believe that they won't..."
4,Works good and doesn't slide around,I have one of these in each of our cars since our dog goes with us everywhere. It stays in place and doesn't slide off the seat or get bunched up. I only gave 4 stars cause it would be better if it had attachment loops at all 4 corners and in the center rather than just on the top.
3,Just what I order,Just what I ordered item was solid made pretty good for a spring shooter safety kind of hard to lock in cant really review got for a gift so really didn't test but I will update later
1,junk!!,"This gun fell apart the first day that my son received it, in the mail!! Very flimsy, and pour quality."
3,ok...,i was expecting something a little more reaalistic looking but it ok i guess the only thing i didnt really like was the orange tip... i broke it off it was so ugly
5,Essential reference,"This is the descendant of the Guinness chart books and contains, for the first time ever, singles and albums (and EPs from a separate chart) together in one volume. Each artist has his/her/their singles, EPs, and albums listed in chronological order along with label, chart debut date, peak, and weeks on chart. Each re-entry onto the chart is noted separately. The index of titles is comprehensive and there is, of course, a chronological recap of number ones. Trivia fanatics will miss the pages of chart oddities that appeared at the back of the Guinness books, but that's a small quibble, since much chart trivia has been stuffed into the main listings (notes under the chart titles, etc.). An essential reference."
3,Fine -- but Lacking,"In Green's Jungles covers Horn's second stop on his way home to the Lizard. Contrary to its title, the novel only barely touches on events, many of them major, that took place on Green. Most of the story focuses on a war between two neighboring cities. I found In Green's Jungles more difficult to enjoy than volume 1, and was often annoyed at Wolfe's unnecessary convolution of simple events. Moreover, the war between the cities, as well as most of the characters involved, seemed inconsequential. This induces the suspicion that the whole book might have been written to stretch a two-book story to trilogy length. Even so, it was a pleasure to read, and I highly recommend the entire series to SF fans who enjoy Wolfe's unique and puzzling style."
3,Useable.,"This vibrator is alright. I mean, it vibrates, so... You can accomplish what you want, I guess.My problem is that the vibrations start off hard and get increasingly harder, rather than starting at a lower intensity. If you like it that way, great, if not, probably look for a different one.Another problem is that the texture can be sort of painful... The bumps are large and set far apart, so you definitely feel each bump as it slides about in you.It's also large. Which is good or bad depending on the mood.Oh, and, on the one I bought, there is a noticeable seam that runs up the middle of it. It's a bit painful if I accidentally knick myself with the seam when trying to masturbate with the tip of it.So. If you're somewhat of a delicate/sensitive person, or just don't get very wet, I wouldn't recommend this vibrator. Or, get it and something more gentle to go along with it."
2,Looks good; watch out for cracked wood,I am about to return this toy box. Everything was fine until I opened the lid; I heard a crack and I found out that the left section of the lid where it rotates had a loose screw and bended metal support. Now imagine what could've happened if the two screws went loose while my daughter was playing. Make sure that section is in good condition in both sides.
1,Not as advertised,"The box this product comes in is clearly marked ""Win 95/98"", unlike the listing for the product on amazon.com which clearly says ""Platform: Windows XP."" I already have this version of the game which runs on Windows XP with problems. First, there is a problem with the sound files on the game -- they get hung up so the introductions don't work. None of the tutorials for the Win 95/98 version of the came work on Windows XP either, so if you don't already know how a game is played, you won't be able to find out. So if you have a Windows 95/98 computer (which I seriously doubt given that it's 2011), fine, buy this game. But if you have Windows XP, don't be fooled."
4,Good Introduction to Asian Medicine,"Most importantly realize this book was published in 1996. Therefore the resources cited might have changed or no longer exist. The author does a good job of simplifying the basic concepts of Asian medicine and how it has evolved over thousands of years. My only wish was that more common ailments were not targeted. The book itself was a quick, easy read and I must say I feel I have a better understanding of Asian medicine and the price was cheap."
5,Simply Excellent!,"An easy to read, comprehensive guide to self-use Asian medicine. Don't hesitate - just buy it and use it! Highly recommended!!!!"
3,Asians have great understanding on Health,I need to take better care of me and have my share of health issues. Herbs can be a great source for medicine and healing. This is a great book on what works. Many items you may have. Make sure you tell your doctor. Do not use anything you may be allergic too. Amazon has a good selection of books to choose from.
4,Damaged package,"I was very disappointed when my package arrived. The bottle had leaked all in the box, therefore I did not receive the full bottle. It appeared the bottle cap was loosened."
2,Computer will not recognize 2 card,"The card is fine, except I cant install the additional card, which is this one. Computer keep saying cannot find the card, but when I put only one it works. Yes, they are the same model. Just going to have to sell this one. So dont waste your time if you have one exactly like it. It will bring you more of a head ache."
1,THEY ARE STOLING YOUR MONEY,"NO INSTRUCTION, DIFFERENT CARD FROM PICTURE ( ACTUALLY IS A SK2000 PICO????) NO DRIVER, NO BMC ADAPTORS, NO SUPPORT AT ALL. I JUST WROTE TO HAVE SOME HELP AND THEY DON'T CARE. 5 MONTHS TRYING INSTALL IT, IF YOU WANT TO RETURN IT YOU HAVE TO PAY THE 50%. D O N' T B U Y IT."
4,Bargain DVR that works,"I've installed many of these cards now, both for myself and for others. While you'll find many mispellings in the manual and software that isn't always that great - it really fit my needs with a budget price. The largest downside is the remote viewing software. This can take hours to get right for each computer. And then when it's right and you upgrade, you have to figure it all out again!"
1,Only runs with Pentium III (not PII),I didn't see this on any of the tech-specs before I bought it. I was going to use an older Dell 4700 PII XP system which seemed to fit the basic quoted specs. WRONG! after several hours I eventually got to page 97 of the flakey manual and found this is a PIII only card. Why couldn't this be listed up front?
4,"Decent DVR, but you'll want IT/networking aptitude","Put 3 of these cards into two dedicated Windows XP boxes (one Home, one Pro). It takes some willingness on your part to learn - port forwarding, etc. Also, in my version of the manual, they only referenced 3 of the 4 ports that needed to be forwarded. Once you see what ports the software is trying to open, you'll see what you need to do. You can also change the ports if you like. I run two servers on the same network just by assigning different ports.I believe you can only run the server side on XP (haven't tried anything else), but I've gotten the client side (WebCam, Remote Playback) to work on XP, Vista, and Windows 7.Video is stored as MPEG4 based AVI files, playable in VLC and Windows Media Player. A 160 GB can hold a couple months of recordings, at least for me, when set to record only when sensing motion.Picture quality is ok (also dependent on the camera, of course).A good value, in my opinion."
4,Excellent device,Good for monitoring and recording videos for 24h with grate features like motion detection etc.
3,Works Fine for the Money,The card works fine for the Money but I have noticed the software does not work well with windows XP. After a while it generates error messages becuase it needs updated CODECs for the remote playback. So if your monitoring a business you may come back to a windows XP crash error message. The only way to minimize this issue is to not upgrade XP beyond service pack 1. For the money though it works fine.
5,It Works and Fits,"This filter was very hard to find and if found was marked up by a large amount. Well like any smart shoppers these days, look at Amazon. The filter came within a week and installed. Its that simple, too bad buying a car can't be that simple."
4,"The Proud Tower: A Portrait of the World Before the War, 1890-1914","I am a history buff, so I enjoy background information, and there was a lot of it! Be prepared to visit the authors notes in the back more then once during your read. It is a lenghty book, but worth the effort."
5,A classic history of the years leading up to World War I,Barbara Tuchman's books on World War I are classics and ought to be on the shelves of anyone who is a student of History for the time period prior to and during World War I. The price is terrific considering what I first paid for this book in hardbound copy when it came out.
5,Pictures before the Exhibition,"Tuchman debunks a consensus in beliefs after WWI idealizing life before the war by reframing snapshots of conflicts in beliefs before WWI still afflicting life after the war: ""A phenomenon of such extended malignance as the Great War does not come out of a Golden Age."""
2,A towering bore of a book,"Loved her books on the middle ages, Stilwell and WWI, but this one seems to have missed the mark widely. Too much scene-setting, it's largely a disjointed series of biographies, with flowery and overblown prose. ""Enough already."" I keep saying."
4,An Uncommon View of History,"Barbara Tuchman attempts something that is not normally done by historians. She tells a tale of how a war starts not from the perspective of princes, politicians and the great generals but from the mood and movements within the societies of the main combatants. We are a century, and a culture, removed from the way our great-grandparents saw life. It's difficult for us to understand how World War I came about without understanding the mind-set of the people who fought it. This, unfortunately, can make for dull reading unless enlivened by the stories of outstanding or eccentric individuals. Real history isn't always so obliging so yes, there are dull sections in this book--especially in the latter half. I applaud Ms. Tuchman's honest and honorable attempt to give us the social viewpoint of the time but I must warn you this is not a book for the casual reader who is looking for light entertainment. This is a work of scholarship."
2,Not one of her best,"Having read three other Barbara Tuchman books I must say this is clearly the worst of the lot. It gets bogged down in boring and thoroughly forgettable minutiae. Page after page of analyzing each and every composition by Richard Strauss is not my idea of a good read. Stick with The Guns of August, First Salute, and A Distant Mirror, great books all, and skip this one"
4,history unknown,"Facinating hisstory subjects not covered in the classroom, but makesa lot of sense leading to the first world war. A war that did not have to occur.What havoc was sown buy so few people."
4,Excellent Addition to my Library,"This is a well written book, in the same intresting and thoughful style as "" The Guns Of August"". I am very happy to have it in my personal collection."
2,Not For Beginners,"I was excited to get the Pink Method after watching the ""Sales Pitch"" on Dr. Phil. After getting set up in my exercise room and starting with the Beginners workout I was shocked that you were expected to do Plank push-ups in the beginners course. I am over 50, but have been working out for years, I was really hoping the exercise videos would be more doable. If you are looking for an exercise program that gently works you into a routine, this is not the one for you."
3,intense,this is an intense work out not for the faint of heart. I have been watching only the beginner video and doubt if I will be ready for the next one for a long time. there is some less intense options shown but not enough. I am 64 and only been doing aqua arobics and 50 lbs overweight
3,not for beginners!,The Pink Method is a great idea but has many errors in the book and is probably a very difficult diet for someone who is very overweight to follow. The reset phase recommends around a thousand calories per day. The DVDs do not show enough modifications for beginners and the workouts are very tough. It also states you can start at any level of fitness but most people seem to be struggling. The book promises help on the website but the book and the website are incongruent. It's worth a try but you must be dedicated to it!
2,PINK method,I love the PINK method. I was looking up the PINK method on the PINK method website. It was on PINK website for $65.00 and I paid 135.00 from Amazon. Also now I can't get signed up under the PINK method for updates and newsletters because I didn't order it from PINK. First time I had really not done my homework and I should of. Paid twice the amount and now I lack the benefits
3,Currently doing the pink diet,"I started the pink diet last week I am doing well and have lost 8 pounds in less than a week however, i would not recommend this if you have more than 50 pounds to lose as the diet is very very strict in the beginning and there is not much modification at all. It takes a lot of will power to get through the reset phase but so far I am having wonderful results but definitely not easy!!"
4,An-Sky - Dybbuk: Satisfied,The book was received without hassle in very good condition and all-in-all the whole process was easy. This served its purpose far a class this semester and it is a book that I will probably not use again but it was a pleasant read.
3,dog collar ok.,The collar seemed a little chintzy but the product was correct. If it had slightly raised diamond studs i would have been happier. the leather is ok but i don't think it will last.
2,Not the original PBS broadcast,This was obviously made after the OCT 2001 military operation in Afganistan began since it showed live film/video of the parachuting and other airborne operations into AFganistan.I keep hearing that the original broadcast in 1998 had more discussion of the Clinton involvemnet of the Somalia debacle impling it was removed by PBS to cover the Clinton administrations you-know-what. I had video taped the original broadcast in 1998 but accidentally taped over it. DANG!!!! Does anyone out there have the original broadcast on home video?
3,Unplugged,"Ever heard (of) a psychobilly band play country music unplugged? - Well, here's your chance.The Frantic Flintstones, a highly popular band on the psychobilly scene, decided - for some reason only known to them - to record an unplugged album of country & rockabilly classics such as 'Will The Circle Be Unbroken', 'Blue Moon Of Kentucky', 'Goodnight Irene', and yes, even 'Tom Dooley'. Weird, isn't it?In fact, the outcome is not that bad. It is definitely worth a listen as a unique project."
3,quesion,"umm if anyone has seen this movie, can you please let me know if its about the stalking of laurie show? please and thankyou."
2,"Tedious tedium, with style","I can see that this book has deeply touched the lives of several reviewers, and I mean them no disrespect; but I do feel that this page could use some balance. I simply could not dig my way through this incredibly long and meandering novel. After 80 pages I skipped ahead, read a couple pages, skipped ahead, read more, skipped ahead again. Not a lot happens. Nothing memorable is said. I encountered no moving episodes. Nothing I could call funny, or exciting. It's about rather dull people doing rather dull things and telling rather dull stories. All written with remarkable skill and flair, admittedly, but skill and flair aren't nearly enough to keep a reader engaged for over a quarter-million words.I recommend this book to the hopelessly literary. If your idea of great fun is to get together with friends over wine and cheese and discuss James Joyce's Ulysses long into the night, you'll love The Tidewater Tales. The rest of us are advised to seek reading pleasure elsewhere."
1,Very disappointed,"I've always thought Hitachi was one of the best until this cap nailer. I have been remodeling for 25 years and know how nail guns should work. Like some other reviews I've had problems with the gun not cutting the caps off and then stringing out 10-15 caps. Its been like this from the beginning, took it in for repair under warranty and they said nothing was wrong. There were days that it worked better then others, I tryed everything without success. I took the nailer in a second time and to a different shop for repair and they told me that was the characteristics of the tool. I finally bought a stinger cap gun for 180.00 and the 500.00 Hitachi sits on a shelf. If anybody knows how to fix this problem please let me know."
1,"Biggest waste of my time, expected better from Hitachi","Bought this gun and four boxes of nails/caps for my roofing crew, ended up being the biggest piece of junk I have ever had the privilege to use. I adjusted psi. the way I was holding the gun, single fire/multi fire, and various other things but the gun would constantly blow through caps or feed out anywhere from 2 to a dozen caps at a time, very rarely did it work. I even traded it in for an identical one and it did the same thing. Ended up waiting for the shipment of Bostitch cap nailers to come in and switched over. For half the price and after about 5000 caps only a handful of jams, the Bostitch is by far the better gun for your money. The downfall for the Hitachi is the roll cap feed design, Bostitch got it right with its tube cap feed design."
1,Worthless cap nailer,"Purchased this item as a gift for my son. Never operated properly. Misfires nails thru cap and caps won't feed properly. After the ""Hitachi Brand"" nails and caps didn't work, he even bought a box of off brand to try, but had the same experience. Brand new gun has never fired a nail in a roof. The hours he wasted trying this product, he could of hand nailed the whole job.After that Amazon wouldn't let me return it because I bought it as a gift and didn't give it to my son for over a month. Amazon said I was past the return period. Thanks Amazon-A quality company. We won't be purchasing another item from Amazon. Never had a problem returning an item that did't work at any other company. They were always glad to assist me. Thanks again Amazon."
5,Absolutely Beautiful,"This is my all-time favorite album.Sad,moving,personal.Brand New 64 Dodge,and One Wrong Turn are standouts on a standout album.Bo Ramseys guitar is the perfect compliment to Gregs lyrics.Greg is in my opinion one of the absolute best artits recording,and this record tops them all.Buy it!!!"
4,Heart and Humor,"Sounding like a cross between Tom Waits and Lyle Lovett, Iowa's Greg Brown sounds like a true grandmaster of the poet game, a bard with vision, heart, and humor. Not quite as gruff as Waits, not quite as cutesy as Lovett, but definitely in the same league in terms of talent both in composing and performing."
5,Greg turns to the dark side...,"This cd marks a shift in Greg Brown's subject matter. Gone are the carefree songs of familial bliss-Greg is cut loose (or is it set free?) and back on the road, rejoining the legions who search, endlessly, for love (or just lovin'). Greg shatters his fans' long held image of him as family man and contented mate. Lusty and full of regrets and desires, The Poet Game will haunt you for days."
2,The worst must-have CD I know of,"This CD is terrible, but you have to buy it. I've noticed that people who like ska don't like these guys. I love ska, so I hate them, but Saba is one of my all time favorite songs of any genre. Something about it soothes the soul. I just love those 'pick-it-up's."
1,I HATE THIS ALBUM!,I am a big ska fan but this album was awful. Not only the message but the music just wosn't good. If you want to hear some good ska music with a message go bye some Five Iron Frenzy
5,You don't have to worship Satan to recognize this is good ska,"In fact, if I ever get to heaven and this isn't on the infinite jukebox, I'll be disappointed. These guys have an amazing horn section and infectious song writing ability. Highlights to me include Doomsday, Saba, and of course the Bumblebee Tuna song. That last one is real earworm, difficult to get it out of your head. It's as if these guys sold their souls to..."
5,The best can hardly describe it,"Mephiskapheles was my first real taste of Ska, and ever since I've been hooked. I don't know whats wrong with the Five Iron Frenzy people, but God Bless Satan is my favorite cd. Besides Mephiskapheles is the only Satanic Ska band around, how great is that! I'm thrilled to get their latest album, Might-Ay White-Ay."
3,"Very short, somewhat ordinary photography, but worth buying at $20","Title summarizes this set pretty well. Each dvd is only 20 minutes...Awfully short considering the prices these things came out at! Nothing great or spectacular about the photography. Just pretty ordinary scenes, but beautiful and relaxing to look at. My copy was open, and the discs loose in the case. 4 had rubs and scratches. Two did not play without some stuttering (Bali being one - a favorite.)"
2,"Poor ""HD"" & Advertising...","They call that HD? Well if so I have seen better. 9 HD-DVD set? Why when they could fit the measly 180 minutes on one or two disks, I think they did it to make it look more impressive than they really are. The unforgivable part for me is how they advertise their website in the bottom right hand corner; look I did not pay this much to have a crappy website link on my TV when I'm trying to relax. It's not all bad they do have some beautiful scenery however money is better spent on something like Planet Earth much better choice.Planet Earth - The Complete BBC Series [HD DVD]"
1,Mediocre picture quality,"These discs are not worth the money. I returned my copy to Amazon for a refund. Only 20 minutes of footage on a loop and the picture quality is mediocre at best. There's no high-def ""pop"" to them at all. Some scenes look like it was a standard DVD on an upconverting DVD player. After watching Planet Earth on HD DVD, the ""HD"" landscapes in this collection really disappoint."
1,"20 minutes each, buyers beware","20 minutes, yes each DVD is only 20 minutes long, so for 9 disc, I kept popping DVD all night, that totally destroy the enjoyment at all. Why not put all of that onto 1 or 2 disc instead?"
2,Did not work at all,Some herbal teas do a better job than this product. I don't recommend it. It also smells petty bad. Save money and drink chamomile tea or hibiscus tea.
5,old habits die hard,"Raised on country music in the heart of Mississippi, I thought I had been educated right out of EVER listening to it again--but boy, did this recording send me scurrying back to my roots! I first heard a cut from it on Public Radio while driving home from Dallas, and I didn't rest until I owned it. That was 6 years ago, and it is still one of my favorites--right alongside the Kathleen Battle/Jessye Norman collaboration and my classical instrumental collection. Kate's voice is clear, pure, and timeless--and this music is just flat-out ""feel-good"" rockin' old-time bluegrass with a modern edge. Allow yourself the pleasure of this experience! You won't regret it!"
1,commercial soaker hoses,"I purchased six of these soaker hoses and was very pleased with the heavy hose material and hoped they would be more durable than the lighter hoses I had previously used in my garden. After putting them in place throughout the garden, two of the new hoses developed serious leaks in the black rubbber material causing water to spout all over. Since they were supposed to be commercial grade and were more expensive, I had hoped for at least more than one season. A week's usage isn't long enough.....How disappointing! I will contact the manufacturer tomorrow and hope they will make some arrangements to correct the problems.Professional Soaker Hose - 50 Foot Length"
5,Another great Vern Gosdin CD,"This CD is all about lost love. When you realize the fact that you've pushed her love away so far that you can never get it back, becomes a RUDE awkening that makes you turn to the ""bottle"" and try to drown the memories you once had together. This CD hit me personally as I was there once years ago. Vern wrote all of the songs here so they're all heartfelt. This CD might not be for everybody, but I""m sure glad that I got it. I will however recommend it to all Vern Gosdin fans as only he can do justice to these songs with his rich baritone voice. There's not a bad song on this CD. It brings me back a lot of memories that I got over years ago. These songs hit the nail on the head and I want to commend Vern for writing and recording his true feelings. Finally, this CD is a gem. Guitar Bob"
2,Not exactly as advertised - beware,"I ordered and received the Fiesta 20-Piece, Service for 4 Dinnerware Set, Cinnabar. It arrived after 3 days ( I had the 2-day free delivery ) and 2 of the bowls were ""seconds"" with obvious flaws, one had a white streak on the side where the glazer had missed, and the other had a roundish chunk of ceramic material on the side. So, beware, becuz they don't tell you they will be sending ""seconds."""
4,Great Everyday Plates,These are pretty heavy duty plates. I notice quite a bit of uneveness in the plates as far as shapes go but once the plates are not stacked you can not tell. They are great for the price and I LOVE to buy AMERICAN!!!! I have dropped one and it did not break which is great for me since I am not the most graceful person in the kitchen. I like to get in and get out quick!
1,Not impressed,"This was my first purchase of Fiesta. I have seen it over the years and finally decided to make the purchase. I needed new dishes in a hurry so I decided to order from Amazon. I usually use Amazon for books and electronics so this was the first purchase of this nature I have made and the first time I was disappointed with the quality of what I got. The dishes seemed like ""imperfects: or something. Many pieces had flaws, although the flaws were very very minor. Once dish arrived broken because of poor packaging. All arrived poorly packaged considering the fragile nature of the item. I love Amazon, I love Fiesta dishes but I don't think the two go together! I returned all that I purchased and went to a local department store to make my purchase instead!"
3,Not happy with my purchase....,"I purchased six 4-piece place setting (different colors) about a month ago. Based on all the great reviews, I thought I would love these dishes. However, in just a month, there are already many scratches on the plates from cutting meat etc. I am surprised! Other than that, I do like these dishes...but they look older than they should after just a month of use. I really wish I had gone with Pfaltzgraff. I like the Jamberry pattern...."
1,not what one would expect,This is not your typical aloe juice that is very yummy. The smell and taste was grotesque to say the least... it's most likely some healthy drink that needs to be diluted
2,not as good as the 16oz,"I bought 2 of the one gallon due to the good pricebut it's only liquid, and it smells stronger than the 16ozI see big difference on my body when I drink the 16oz,but this one is just a little bitSo I hope I can finish it quickly and drink the 16oz again."
2,Soft-core porn set in a cheesy plot gives mild thrills,"My father rented this movie not knowing right off the bat two lesbians would be having sex in the opening sequence. This caused quite the commotion with my mother and almost caused a fight (lol). The movie itself is packed with low-grade 45-20 sec long soft-core porn scenes that only show the breasts and vagina once. It's not a sexy-thriller like Wild Things or Cruel Intentions. Expect poor acting and laughs at the attempt of drama put into the low-budget pathetic film. I gave it two stars due to the fact that it was mildly interesting to see how it ended.The Plot: Abby, [...], moves into the local neighborhood and has sex with both the men and women to frame the men into paying 100 grand in exchange for not releasing the video tape of them committing adultery. There are several heterosexual love scenes and two lesbians scenes not worth getting excited about. You may want to take a second thought before renting this one."
3,ok movie,Why I gave this movie only three stars is because it is a little on the boring side. Although it is still a good movie.
5,LA SCORTA,If you live and read about the world of Mafia and corruption this movie breaks it down.It elaborates the lives of the law enforcement officers in Italy and the protection they get on a daily basis.Very intense .....Ed
2,Made for Late Night Television,"Somehow Tognazzi has dully rendered what should be riveting material about political and mafioso machinations in Sicilia. This film plays like a mediocre telanovela, devoid of artistry and utterly conventional. Maybe this is the reason Hollywood is remaking the movie."
3,"Unfortunately, not as good as The Gruffalo","The Gruffalo is one of our son's favorite books. He requests it often and sometimes even insists on sleeping with it. I ordered this book hoping it would be as good as the first and, well, it just isn't. Our son isn't as interested and in all honesty, neither am I. The story just isn't as good. But, if you have a Gruffalo fan in your house, it's worth a shot."
5,"Excellent book, part 2",My kids are never quiet except when reading especially this book. They want me to read it over and over again.
5,"Not as good, but still great!",I agree with other reviews that I don't think this book is as good as The Gruffalo...but I'm still giving it 5 stars because it is still a really great book. I don't think the story is as clever and the ending seems a little anti-climatic. But my 18 month old son LOVES this book...even more than The Gruffalo. This is one of the most often read books in our house.
5,Love It,I have an in home daycare and my daycare children just love the Gruffalo books write some more!!!
5,kids loved it,This was a very good book. The kids loved it as much as they loved the first one. It has suspense for them without being too scary. The movie was great also.
4,Delightful book with a scary part,"The art is delightful and is written wonderfully well. There is one part which may scare young children. Other than that, it is delightul and creative."
1,This order never arrived!,I would love to review this product if it in fact even had arrived! I had to reorder this book and three other similar childrens books through Amazon.com of which none have arrived. I am hoping that Amazon can give some explaination as to why this happened as until they do I will neve order anything through them that requires shipping!
3,audio book (story on CD),"Love the story and the story narrator is terrific, sound effects and music add a lot to the reading as well. But be aware that this audiobook CD does not include page turn signals, so if you want to use it in a listening center it may not work well."
5,Gruffalo's Child,"We already loved the Gruffalo, and were excited to discover a sequel. This was a great edition to our book collection."
1,Kindle audio book snafu,"DON'T be confused,it's in the Kindle store but it is NOT a Kindle book. This is ONLY an audio book. I was very disappointed that my son would not get to see the pictures while he was listening to the book. In my opinion it should be removed from the Kindle store so no one else wastes money."
2,Uber bore,"If you like shooters, this is one, and in some ways it is a fair attempt to be in a ballpark with the other military games. The graphics are not even close, and the story and game become a bit of a bore halfway through the game."
2,Some polish would be nice,"The gameplay was acceptable but that's where the positives end. The voice acting is the worst I have seen since the first games with voice overlay. It's odd that all the nazis seem to have some strange southern accent and don't at all seem interested in conveying any emotion. Character voice talent is flat and makes continuing the game very painful, mostly because you feel bad for the developer for putting out such a poorly polished product. Was there a storyline, I'm not quite sure but the characters sure didn't seem to care. They must have asked the janitors in the building to perform the voiceovers because they don't seem very interested in what they are saying. Loading times are excessive even on performance rigs and is somewhat crash prone. Just wait for something good to come out or replay something you already own."
1,Not Playable As Is,"At the begining of the game the game begins to run in slow motion and you soon realize that this is not how it is suppose to go. Obviously there is a huge glitch at the start. Once they issue a patch for the problem, the game may be playable and a realistic review could be written. I have waited for this game for some time and am very dissapointed I cannot play it as it is."
1,Beware: Not for Windows 7,"Ubersoldier comes with Starforce. Older versions of Starforce will not work with newer Windows. If you have Windows XP, the game will run fine. If you have Windows 7, do not install the game or Starforce may mess up your computer.Sometimes Starforce won't do any damage to your computer, it may simply state that it won't work with a generic Windows message. Other times Starforce may stop your computer from starting up correctly, resulting in headaches trying to get the computer to work again.Beware all games with Starforce on them."
1,Doesn't play,I bought and installed this game only to never get to play it. I was lookin forward to this game for awhile and its a huge glitch.To start off with it takes three dayz to load and second it won't make it 5 secs in the game without freezing and having to task manger out ofit. I uninstalled and don't reccommend anyone to waste their money on this crap.
4,Good rockabilly,"While the Frantic Flintstones are one of the most popular bands in psychobilly - a genre that I'm not particularly fond of - on this album they play some pretty good (neo-)rockabilly.A well-produced album with clean sound - except for Track 14, which sounds as if it had been recorded with a portable cassette player sometime in 1985.All in all, a good chance to catch these Flintstones in a less Frantic mood."
2,An OK ST-TNG,"I just finished Maximum Warp One and Two and felt there was just enough plot for one book, but not two. Whatever plot there was was too skimpy and not fleshed out enough. The authors did lip service to the characters and jumped from one scene to another without a regard to ""readibility."" Additionally, the ending was quite confusing, long winded and ended with a wimper vs bang as I was hoping for. I was left re-reading the ending just to keep track of the theories (Unified Theory and Type 1, 2,3, and 4 Civilizations, sub-Black Holes etc) and still was pretty lost. I did not even understand the how Picard(s) saved the Universe! Overall, if you are a die hard Trekker, then buy it. If you are not, then don't waste your money."
1,Terrible,"I believe that 'Maximum Warp' was one of the worst Star Trek series ever written.Firstly, the plot seemed implausible and amatuerish. The idea of dead zones just didn't work for me. And Starfleet was portrayed as a =n organisation that employed loony PR spin doctors to calm the public. Such a concept is totally contrary to the Starfleet that we all know.Secondly, the characterisations seemed off. Picard didn't seem like the man we all know from TNG and the movies.I read half the book, but was so disgusted with it that I stopped reading and threw it out.That being said, I enjoyed previous Dave Galanter works. 'Battle Lines' was a fantastic Voyager book. Dave also provided an email address int hat book, and was very gracious in replying to my email. I believe that he is a talented Star Trek author, but he has missed the mark with this book. Better luck next time.Don't waste your time on this book, but don't disregard Galanter's other works."
1,do not buy,"This product is cruel to bettas, it does not give them nearly enough space. Spend a little more and get them something at least 1 gallon or bigger, please. They will be much happier AND healthier."
3,Attractive,"Built around a wealth of rare and high quality photographs, the editorial content is intentionally limited to what amount to biographies of the individual cars showcased, with some brief background on production dates and costs. Those interested in more detail about the particular coach manufacturers will be well served by referring to works by authors like Walt McCall, or the numerous websites devoted to particular coach builders.For those interested in beautifully reproduced images of these glamorous vehicles the book will be a welcome addition to their collection."
3,Fading Classic,"This book, which has been supplanted by more recent works, is the classic American text on creating and using self-directed work teams. The authors represent the Zenger-Miller approach, one that has been well-used in many manufacturing environments.Pros: provides very practical information about exactly how to implement self-directed teams; strongest for the manufacturing environment; provides sample materials that can easily be customized for a company.Cons: based on models that worked in manufacturing environments of the 1960s, before downsizing and the Internet; very time-consuming - many companies now need to move faster than this; assumes time and resources that no longer exist in many companies."
2,Australian Flag,"More of a banner than a flag. However, I like the concept of Australia being descended from convicts and immigrants. Like us."
3,Eh..,Bit cheap looking (you can see the blue fabric through the white border on the left) but I guess that makes sense considering it was so inexpensive.
3,"Does what I wanted, but non-existing customer support","Purchased this as a portable alarm primarily to detect and sound-off on window break-and-steal (happened). My ""luxury"" car sounds off only on door openings. This product does as expected. The ""hard"" wiring provision is extremely complicated, and I had no use for it (fortunately). The unit is transportable from car to car (mine; my wife's). However, an inquiry as to battery longevity and charging tolerance resulted in an incredible display of ignorance and resulted in ""no help"". I still don't know if I can even purchase a backup battery, as the connection is unique. Right now, I would purchase again, but not waste time trying to talk to any customer service rep. about anything."
5,"as of 2008, this remains the McLaren F1 of routers","Lots of modern routers can run dd-wrt and tomato, and quite a few can add some extra packages on at the same time. Routers based on Broadcom firmware fare especially well. But with 64 MB of RAM and 8 MB of flash, the WZR-RS-G54 is in a class by itself. This is the best performing router you could ever buy in 2008.Forget the amazing feature set it came with, dd-wrt gives most of those features to everyone nowadays. Forget the astounding price; if you can find one at all these days, it will probably be $300 or less. The WZR-RS-G54 continues to exist for those few who have to have the best router ever made. If that's your cause, good luck to you. Find one."
5,Perfect VPN solution for SOHO users,"I couldn't agree more with Sandeep's review. I got this to implement as a gateway router, wireless AP, and PPTP server. The performance of the PPTP tunnels is exceptional. They stay up all day with no drops. The device has been rock steady. I have gobs of experience implementing IPSec VPN solutions. I find them expensive and overly complicated. PPTP serves the needs of a SOHO user perfectly. I had this up and running in 10 minutes. There need to be more products like this.The only con is that the interface needs more polish, but it definitely gets the job done.I have no reservations recommending this as a solution in a business settings."
4,As time passes by...,"It is a touching story of a mother of two vigorously attempting to make it into music industry where young girls usually succeed deploying specific ways only.Performing is good and a problem of ageing mentality embedded perfectly from viewpoint of Melbournian environment where music, drugs and sex are in a reasonable not dominating mix provided.Not boring work at all."
1,Defective,"After using the product for 5 minutes one of the connectors inside the sealed unit separated from the power supply. I might be able to fix it myself but i'm unsure how to get the casing to open which begs the question: how the heck could it have come lose? The welding is shoddy, delicate, and isn't designed for the bump n' grind."
4,Pretty good. Some minor complaints...,"This is a pretty good toy. It's hard to find a variable speed bullet with c-ring. My only complaint is that it's not really variable speed. The knob is pretty much ""regular"" or ""slightly more than regular"". The knob also is super sensitive and sometimes turns itself on (or up) by itself. The c-ring is just a tad too tight also, but I'll put up with it as long as it holds up. I've had others that have split apart after a few uses. This one has held up really well."
2,Not Real Good Quality,"Fairly low vibration and was not up to my expectation! I believe that it is better to only order products which take AA or AAA batteries, and not use ones with built-in batteries."
2,Eh...,This one didn't thrill either one of us. The positioning of the vibrating bullet didn't really stimulate either of us. Plus the cord hanging the middle of everything is just weird! I wouldn't purchase this again.
3,Hey this is nice....wait...is that rust?!,"So, I bought this product a good many months ago. It worked great for me, and I really enjoyed it. It was cheap, small, and the settings were fine for me. (It's dial only has two. Fast and faster. Lol.)Unfortunately, two months ago it quit on me. I thought that the vibrator bullet end was waterproof, but nope. It's not. I hadn't seen or realized that it was rusting on the inside. Leading up to it's premature death. Lol.Moral of the story is to try not to wash it directly with water! Or...something. I don't know of any other way than soap and water, possibly rubbing alcohol, to clean a 'toy'.I'm currently in the market to find a better, more reliable, waterproof, vibrator. Any suggestions are appreciated. :]Blessings to all!Sincerely,Mz. Anne."
1,Not for XP,"This game is listed for being compatible with Windows XP. That is why we bought it, my mother's version of Sorry wouldn't work after we upgraded her laptop. Now, I need to find the time to return the game before time expires. Amazon might list it as compatible with Windows XP, but don't believe it the box and manufacturer only claim it for Windows 95!"
3,Good game in the day but doesn't work on modern computers,This was a good game for the time but now it doesn't work on most computers so I would not recommend buying this unless you still have a windows 95.
4,pleased but not baby friendly,The book is great. The pictures are nice and it is simple and easy to read to a baby or toddler. My only complaint is that I think that this book should come as a board book. That way I don't have to constantly worry about the pages being ripped. My toddler likes to hold the book while I read.
4,Cute book,"This is a cute book. It's short and simple, which is easy to read to little ones. The illistrations are very pretty, also. Good gift to give as a baby shower gift or to a grown-up ""from a child"". (There is a page inside that says 'This book is to ______ with love"".) I gave this book to my Brother-in-law but wrote inside that it was from his son."
4,Cute story,"The artwork is great, our toddler loves all the pictures. There is not a ton of content to the book and the story is very simple. Overall a nice, sweet book about Dads and what they do for their little ones."
3,The other reviewers were right...get the eTon 10 or eTon 100,"This radio doesn't have the pulling-in power on Shortwave as the eTon 10 or eTon 100. Maybe wait for a sale on the eTon 10 or 100. Although for simple AM/FM listening, this Grunding/eTon G1100 radio is super. And I even like it's tuning-ease better than the eTon 10/100."
3,Good radio but only displays 24 hour time,This is a good radio.It's easy to use and operate. You can use an ac adopter. The radio does not come with one. It's portable. According to the features stated on the carton it's says that we can set the clock to the 12 hour time. However according to the instructions manual and the technical support the clock feature of this radio only support 24 hour time display.
2,Reception,I bought it and tried it on FM I was not happy with it I hardly could get us99.5 or MPR with it. I have not tried the SW yet.
5,totally necessary!,"Super! I recently bought a new radio of the same model I've used for nearly ten years. The old radio still works well but the tuning dial no longer turns smoothly. I had bought the first as a a nifty compact travel radio and alarm and it soon became my everyday bedside radio. The sound is good. I love how you can time it to go off after 30, 60 minutes etc. so you can listen to a program and let it put you to sleep. I'm still using my first radio at home but the second is now in my suitcase, ready to go and locate new stations easily."
3,No heat adjustment,"I was really excited to use this crepe maker after reading many good reviews, but I am disappointed for 2 reasons:1. There is no way to adjust the heat. Different recipes require different cooking temps and this machine only has one setting (""on""). Because I am gluten intolerant, I make these super yummy gluten free crepes that come out perfectly in a pan, but literally simmer and burn on this crepe maker. They come off with hundreds of tiny holes, too - the result of too high heat.2. The cord is ridiculously short. I couldn't even plug it in to the wall that is right next to my table without an extension cord.If you could adjust the temp, I would say this machine is great. It may work well with regular wheat flour recipes, but I have now found nicer machines with temperature controls."
1,Villaware Crepe Maker,Perfect in the beginning-then the teflon coating started coming off-wonderng about he health risks from ingesting the teflon? Not healthful-not a good product! Will not buy again.
3,"Great product, not long lasting...","I really enjoyed making crepes with the product. It is very easy to use and allows me to quickly get a dessert or savory snack to my family. I have used mine 3-4 times per month over the past 1.5 years that I have had it. While great, I have noticed that there are areas in which the non-stick surface has worn away. The crepes now don't come off as smoothly as they once did. Additionally, the smaller crepe size limits the ability to create some of the great crepe dishes that you get at the local crepe trailer. Overall, great product. I was a little disappointed in the durability from a VillaWare product."
5,Great product,Gave this to my sister in law for Christmas and she said she loves it and has already used it several times.
4,very efficient,"I have an older crepe maker (from the 80s, I think!) that works better. The tray for this one is too light and not very practical (IMHO), so I used a pie plate. That works fine but because there is no ""notch"" in the crepe maker's handle, the appliance enters the pie plate on a slight angle. My old maker had a notched handle which allowed me to enter the plate fully parallel (making full crepes all the way to the end of the batter). It sounds picky but when you are making tons of crepes (as I do, as a French club advisor), it gets annoying. For the average user, I'm sure it would be fine. It heats quickly, is easy to clean (not very different from my old one) and does the job. If you use the tray, the issue I described would be moot."
3,Bit of a dissapointment,Wasn't aware the product was 120v and haven't been able to use it yet...Think this should be made clear.
5,I love this crepe maker,This crepe maker is so easy to use and makes the best CREPES. Yummy...definitely a good buy
4,Very satisfied.,"This crepe maker works great. It's so easy to use and makes crepes quickly. The recipe for sweet crepes given in the recipe booklet is not sweet enough, so I'm searching for a better recipe. This product delivers excellent results for the price."
4,Great Gift,"We have the Maxim Crepe Maker which we felt was the best but you can never find it except used on Ebay. The VillaWare is a 2nd best. We got to give as a gift. Once you get the first one done the rest work out just great. Make them ahead of time and freeze them.Forget the Pan, Dip Flip and Peel. Thats it."
5,I would recommend this to everyone!,"I bought this crepe maker for a fund raiser we were doing and one of the things we sold were crepes, this was fast and easy! They never stuck and the dipping pan was very handy. Most of our group were not familiar with crepes but they were all able to use this pan with no trouble! We now use it at home and we love it!"
3,Crepe maker,"It's ok, not spectacular. The dish that the pan sits in isn't the same shape as the crepe maker, so the crepes come out uneven. I had another crepe maker prior to this one, and the dish was concave."
5,Pleasantly surprised,"If I had known how easy this is, I would have bought this years ago. I love crepes and make them often, but in the pan they tend to stick or tear. Just made a bunch with my new toy here - they all turned out perfect. It's so easy, my cat would probably be able to bake these with this crepe maker. Glad I ordered it."
4,Why only 4 stars .... well ...,This may be one of the better crepe makers at the price there are a couple of things that really bum me out ...One .. it takes close to a good 3 to 4 minutes to make a crepe on this machine even though it has a 900 watt element (200 more than and older model...) so unless you are makeing crepes for one ... realx have a drink cause your gonna be sitting at this machine for some time ..Two .. the teflon covering .. well it's French teflon ... don't expect it to last ... nuff said ...Three .. the handle doesnt come off and the crepe batter is pretty liquid so get ready to use toothpicks to clean the cracks between the handle of the crepe maker and teflon plateFour .. appart from that it's probably the best machine out there .. definitely for the money ... and .. since we love crepes and theres more than one person in my house I've bought 2 of these machines ... go figure ....PS.... you have to try the corn meal crepes they are the most .....
2,Teflon surface comes off,"We have had this crepe maker for about a year, and although it makes great crepes, the teflon surface is seriously peeling off (enough that we can no longer use it) after just about 20 uses. This is my major problem with it, and I will not by this brand again.It does make much thinner, more delicate crepes than using a pan, but the batter has to be just so - not too much or too little oil or flour, or else they either stick or fall off the surface."
3,"Makes great crepes, but ...","This crepe maker really does make great crepes, but I wish someone would actually cook with these gadgets before they sell them. The cord coming out of the end of the handle (the picture doesn't show this) is just ridiculous. If your receptacle is in the wall and you're holding the crepe maker by the handle, the cord just gets tangled, in the way and sometimes dunked in the batter. But the worst thing was that after less than 20 uses, the teflon is starting to wear off. Teflon is definitely NOT a good thing to eat, so I am going to retire this crepe maker. I only wish I could find one that didn't have a non-stick coating."
5,Crepe Maker,I have looked all over the internet and every store I know for a crepe maker like my mom used. It is so incredibly fun and easy I am very happy I found one and it works just as great as my moms did for her.
2,very poorly design,"The first time and will be the last time I tried my crepe maker, it was a challenge for me and so disappointed when using the product because of the very poor design. First of all, I thought the design is just like a non-stick pan that even you pour the batter it will not rolled all the way down on the crepe maker. The only good on this item and IF it has a good design, you can make a dozen of crepes in a matter of less time and effort. I will not definitely recommend this item, it is just a waste of money. I am trying to return to Amazon the crepe maker for I am not happy with the product."
1,They dont send me anything,"I check the tracking number and they said they already send it but it NEVER arrives, I only loose my Money"
2,crepe machine without instructions,bought my machine 8-9 months ago and just opened today found out no instruction booklet for the unit.
5,Christmas Present,I'm sorry but I gave this Crepe Maker as a Christmas Presentso I wouldn't be able to give you a fair assessment of it.
5,A must have for young families!,"This recording is absolutely the best! Its not just a kid CD - you will find yourself tapping your toes, singing along and humming their renditions long after you've stopped listening to the recording. It keeps the kids engaged and occupied for hours on end. Additionally, its a great way to get your kids exposed to ""music from your day"" in a fun way. I highly recommend!"
5,We love it!,"My kids (6,5 &3) all really love this CD. I love that I find myself sings songs from this CD vs. Raffi's ""Baby Beluga"" personally. There were a few renditions that I didn't love at first ( ie- Rockin Robin), but they've grown on me. I am looking to get a few more Suger Beats CDs now that the kids are really familiar with the songs on this one. If you like the originals, it is a fun way to intro them to your kids."
3,"Three and a half stars, really.","A funny book, typical of Jay Leno. Some of these headlines are typos (Ada Kring, 67-year old Orick resident, dies at age 94), some are simply indications of how strange the world we live in is (Arsonist elected fire department chief), and still others would only be minorly odd were it not for Leno's chirping from the peanut gallery (Condoms only work if used, study finds) (to which Leno's comment was, ""Oh, sure, but who wants a used condom?""). Then again, some fit two or more of the above categories (Store clerk better after being shot) which is an odd enough phraseology on its own, but becomes even more bizarre when Leno chips in ""I think if we knifed him, he might feel even better still.""If you like your humor sophisticated and mature, this book is not for you. But if you enjoy a bit of unreserved silliness with your humor, and appreciate plays on words, this book is good for more than a few chuckles."
4,Nice product! It works but...,"It's not as quality as OEM, but it really works fine on my corolla 2005. I have used the Mann-filter MA-1026 before and all I can say this filter looks and feel cheaper, very light... The Mann-filter have the gasket made from rubber on a plastic frame, but the pentuis PAB9482 got it made from the same paper material.It fits like OEM, and the engine really feels smoother with it. the reason why only 4 stars.. the gasket made from the same paper filter material."
3,"OK Table, but chips are useless","The tabletop is fine but the 300 chips included are made of very very light weight plastic and are worthless, so don't let the chips influence your purchase."
1,Don't beleive everything you read in an items name,"It's called the Trademark Global Texas Traveller Octagonal Poker Table Top Set, but there is no tabletop it's only poker chips and a case of which neither are octagonal. I even contacted two different sellers apart from the seller I actually purchased of this item after receiving the item without the poker tabletop, and both said that they were only meaning to sell the poker chips and case. I pointed out that in the item description and title of the listings stated clearly ""Trademark Global Texas Traveller Octagonal Poker Table Top Set"". They blamed Amazon for the incorrect listing, but I suspect others at fault. With this item you'll want to ask about what you're really getting before you buy. And it was far too expensive just for 11.5 oz. chips that are not even made of clay. I'm severely disappointed."
2,Keep Looking,"We purchased the poker table for weekly play and thought it was a good deal considering it is just a top. In the picture it appears black, but it is actually green. We purchased it ""new"" from amazon.com and it seems that it was used. On the side of one of the edges it seems that it has been patched with felt. I would not expect this from a product that is supposed to be ""new"". I shop frequently on amazon and am extremely disappointed with this purchase!!"
4,Good for the price!,"I love poker and so does my husband. Perfect Father's day gift. The chips are the cheaper ones but since thats all we could ever afford it worked out great. They are the same chips you would buy at Wal-mart, K-mart, Walgreens, Rite aid. No one likes mis-matched chips. So if your on a budget like i was. Spend $10 get 250 chips at the stores i listed and then get this set and you have enough chips for 8 people and can really enjoy the game."
1,Poker table top,Very disappointed with the appearance of this item. Definately do not waste your money on wrapping. It came in a felt bag that was ripped and it just hid a torn up box. This is a gift and I am almost too embarassed to give it.
2,Travel Poker Table,"Its just OK, nothing special. Cover carrying bag came with broken zipper. This table topper is light weight and a little flimsy. you might only want to get this one if your new to the game and not sure you would use it much, because if you play a lot I dont think this one will hold up long."
1,Lets get it together people,"I ordered the Texas traveller table top & 300 chip set for my avid poker playing husband for our anniversary & when I received the package the was just a chip set, I called the company & talked to the woman who handled my order. The woman told me that she knows why my order was messed up & that Amazon had it advertised wrong, she also said she would send me a pre paid slip to mail it back that took 3 days for me to get via E-mail. It makes me wonder why there was no commutation regarding my order so that it could be resolved prior to sending it out.I sent the package back & they received it on 1-25-11 & as of 2-1-11 I'm still waiting for my money to be put back into my account so I can order a different poker table before my anniversary. It was very unprofessional how things were handled & I will not be ordering from this company again any time soon."
1,"Poor quality of ink, bended wood",They did not allowed the ink to dry before folding. One of the panels was bended and did not lay flat. I returned the item for a full refund.
5,Great Poker Table,"I purchased this table for ""Poker Nights"" with the guys this table is very easy to set up, and fold up and transport anywhere. Drinks fit perfectly in the holders."
2,Incomplete,"The table was sort of fine, but it came without the cards and without the dealer and blind chips."
1,Didn't come with the table top???,"I read a few other reviews before I bought and couldn't fathoms that someone actually ordered this product and it arrived without the table top. Well, I should have listened. I ordered this for an Xmas gift and scrambled to get a table in time. The return was very easy, as is the normal experience I have with Amazon, but can't understand how they don't ship the product???? That's the reason for my 1 star rating. I'm sure that they don't always mis-ship, but if you read thru the reviews, it's more common than necessary."
4,Poker table top,Nice table. Really liked it. The chips could have been nicer. Overall happy. Made my money back first day I used it.lol
3,Trademark Poker Texas Traveler Table Top & Chip Travel Set,"The product that I purchased was excellent, except for the 120 chips that was missing from it. I was missing at least 20 red chips, and it had no black chips at all. The table top, however, was in excellent condition. Had I received all of the chips, I would have given this product five stars."
1,Only for true fans - it's a vinyl copy,"I was very happy to see that this album is available on CD. If it were a copy from the master tapes my rate would be 5 stars. But it's only a copy from vinyl with poor sound. I hope there will be a copy from the master tapes in the future!... And now you can buy ""3 Originals"", which include the first 4 (!) Ekseption LP's, this one, too (Mercury)!"
4,Interesting Background Information,"As a NASCAR fan, I was curious who this new driver entering the sport might be. Was she just a pretty face or somebody that could really do well? This book gave me the background I was looking for. It showed that Danica is a determined young lady with a true champions spirit and attitude. She has the discipline needed to learn and grow as she gains experience in a similar but new racing field. Needless to say, based upon what I read, I have become a NASCAR fan of hers and cheer her on when I see her race."
3,Racing Star Doesn't Play well in Print.,"Danica Patrick garnered every award possible in her 2005 season on the Indie circuit and she earn it! Telling her story of hard work and determination doesn't work, not for the astute public who follows every aspect of motor racing. The writing is trite and demeaning for her outstanding achievement.I don't know the intended audience for this title, but I'd place it in a junior high/middle school library for browsing.I knew there was a reason it had been lying in the TBR pile since its publication.Nash Black, author of QUALIFYING LAPS."
5,A Must for Danica Fans and Racing Fans,An excellent book for fans of Danica Patrick as well as racing fans. If your an Indy fan or NASCAR fan this is a must read book. You are given a glimpse of what makes a race car driver tick. Other drivers need to take notice Danica Patrick is not just one of the best woman drivers of all time. She is one of the best drivers of all time.
5,Great way to learn what brought her to Indy in detail,"We've only heard bits and pieces of the background of Danica Patrick and what got her to Indy, but by reading this book you learn the details. Karting, Formula Ford in UK, her patron sponsors, Bobby Rahal discovering her, her families dedication to her, her romance with her eventual husband.My own feelings about her - having been someone myself who went to England to race FF1600 at 26 - is that her biggest accomplishment was going to England at 16 for 3 years to race. She didn't get good cars, and no one was there to look out for her and it affected her results of course. It took a lot of guts. (She has guts!)I came away being a fan of her's - I wasn't before."
2,Not as Described,"The actual book is fine, but was not received as described. There were 2 sticky residue marks on the front and back covers, where there most likely had been a ""sale"" sticker. Can't get it off!! There were also a few pages that were bent/folded on the inside."
4,Great role model - excellent read for young women,"This book is inspiring to all ages and is highly recommended to young women! You do not need to be a racing fanatic to enjoy this book. Danica Patrick is an amazing woman who sets an excellent example that any dream is possible if you have passion, stay focused on your goals and have a good support network. As I myself am a woman working in a male-dominated career, her descriptions of the challenges faced and what it takes to succeed are right-on target. The quantity of photos was a great extra as well as the diary entries. I liked that she responded to complaints by her critics. I gave it four stars because I would have enjoyed fewer inspirational quotes and more tangible details about her car, the typical day, her racing education, etc."
1,Ego Crazy Can't Stop Talking About How Great She Is.,"I bought this book because I race.....at a much lower level. I was interested in how she came up in racing in Europe. In addition, she is good....rookie of the year is impressive.However, I had to put the book down after about 20 pages because I could not stand to hear her talk any longer about how great she is. How unstoppable she is...how determined, bulletproof, supreme, brilliant, ultra talented. I was waiting to hear about her experiences coming up as a driver. But every topic change was another opportunity to tell me how incredible she is.She is good, young, and hasn't won an Indy race yet. I'm sure an amount of confidence is required for a driver.....but she is over the top."
4,"A ""MUST READ"" for sci-fi fans!","Excellent book! My husband and I agree this book is a ""must read"" for all sci-fi fans. It took some unexpected turns and kept me interested throughout. This, along with Mr. Bolton's dry humor, oftentimes when you would least expect it, makes this a most enjoyable book. Although some may find the beginning of the book a little slow, it was necessary to sufficiently acquaint us with Pegasus and her crew. I look forward to seeing how Mr. Bolton continues to develop his intriguing characters in the next installment of the Star Voyager series!"
4,Fantastic ride!!!!,"This novel is an excellent start for what I hope is the first of many books in this series. It is a little slow at first due to the character backgrounds which the author has provided to the reader but I think it is well worth the time and energy to learn about the Captain and crew. Once the ship leaves out of dry dock the story really moves along. It has a lot of action and I look forward to reading Mr. Bolton's next novel in this series. Overall it is a fantastic first effort for a new author, especially one that comes from a background in law enforcement and tries his hand at sci-fi! I AM HOOKED!!!!! Bring on the second installment to this series QUICKLY!! I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS NOVEL TO ALL SCI-FI FANS!!"
5,To Dry For? To Die For!!!,"I am completely hooked on this product! You can buy the cheapest nail polish that wouldn't normally last a day, put two coats of To Dry For over it and it'll stay for a WEEK!! It's also great for decals and rhinestones. They don't come off till you take them off and then it isn't easy! I do a lot of garden work and used to break, train and show horses in California. I hate gloves and wear arficial nails. My polish was never an issue. To Dry For really is To Die For!!!!!!!"
4,It Grew On Me,"I purchased this CD on the strength of a single song, Codependent With You, which I happened to hear on some random Pittsburgh station a few years ago. There's an inherent danger to this kind of impulse buy; how often does one end up with a CD where the only good song is the one for which the CD was purchased? And at first, I was disappointed. Having not read anything about the group or the CD, I was expecting more humorous songs; as it turns out, only about a third of the CD could be classified that way. But the remainder grew on me, slowly. The beautiful harmonizing is one of the bright points."
1,I wanted to use this book.,"I really wanted to use this book to teach my Modern Physics class this semester. But the fact that whole sections are omitted from the text and placed online ruined the book. Figure numbers jump in sequence, references are made to equations that are not in the text, and the whole experience of sitting down with a book to learn is defeated.I don't know why the authors or publishers insisted on doing this this way. I would have adoped the book if they hadn't."
2,Mediocre at best,"This book's explanations vary from poor to excellent. The derivations, while they are given, are not well done. They often skip steps that leaving the reader wondering just how they got from point A to point B. The answers in the back of the book and in the instructor's solutions manual are also often incorrect. The publisher of this book also elected to put large sections of this book online instead of in the book. An entire chapter, the astrophysics section, is online, which is absolutely ludicrous for such an expensive book. Overall, this book just doesn't cut it."
2,Incomplete,"This solution manual only shows a solution to every other odd problem... which is insufficient. When I need help on a problem, there is not usually anything even close to what I am trying to do in the examples, or the solution manual. (unless its one of the solved problems, which only occurs 1 out of 5 times.)"
2,Poor,"Book is poorly written, explainations are sometimes hard to follow, organization is poor, and overall i had to read sections more than once just to understand it.i would recommend Kenneth Krane's Modern Physics over this, which i tried reading afterwards. it may have sometimes hard to follow organization, but the explainations, the equations, and the overall structure of this book is much better than this book.Reviewer: good physics student who usually learns from the book more than the actual teacher, but in the case of this book, i needed the teacher. however, during the summer i read the end half of the aforementioned krane's book and i could pick up the physics much more easily (without a teacher even)."
2,A Waste of a Modern Physics Text,"We used this as the primary text for my UG Modern Physics II class, which essentially covered special/general relativity and particle physics. I agree with other reviewers that it is highly annoying that the authors will place whole chunks of text on the website, and expect the students to look it up there rather than in the book, where it should be. I understand that undergraduate physics students will not understand everything about quantum mechanics and the underlying principles of particle physics, but this text definitely makes the material too easy and leaves out almost all the math at times. Explanations are often trivial and not understandable. This is precisely what a physics textbook should not be, and as such I recommend looking elsewhere for a modern physics text."
4,Best Modern Physics Book I've seen yet.,"I own several modern physics books,and over all this book is the best. It presents information in a direct, concise, and clear manner. I often used this book instead of my text book to help me understand the concepts necessary to excell in my class. Sometimes the information is a bit much, and a little overwhelming if not intimidating, but over all this introductory to modern physics text is the best one currently in print."
3,Not good writers,"Not well-edited. I had to buy this because of my class. But if you are just buying for your own reading, buy 'six ideas that changed physics' instead."
2,"Disapointing, but still helps a bit.","I got this book to help walk me through some of the problems in the real text. As I saw other people said, this book leaves out many small steps that seem crucial and leave you wondering where they get certain numbers from. It helps but sometimes takes longer than it should to find out how to work out an answer. It would be nice if the author put more text in this book explaining the problems more in depth. I also found a lot of minor errors that can throw you off at first."
2,Somewhat frustrating,"This book's explanation on materials can be arduous and a bit unnecessary -- I think the writers could instead provide concise, intuitive material to more effectively guide readers.The examples/exercises should be revised for errors and more detailed documentation.I would say this book is still readable -- bring it along when you're bored."
1,This book should be banned from bookstores world-wide!!,"The information in the book is readable, but one doesn't learn the material just by reading it. The problem with this book is the homework problems (no pun intended). The book does not provide enough detail to help tackle some of the problems in the book. Often times, I would have to seek other resources (google, other books, etc.). As a matter of fact, most of the information in this book could be found and explained better on the internet, which is free by the way. For those who don't have a ""death-grip"" in mechanics, beware. You will be on your own with this book.I believe that there are better books out there on Modern Physics. Please consider other Modern Physics text."
3,Not enough information,"I agree with the other reviewers who stated that the derivations are not well done. The authors could've done more to explain the steps taken and why. I am a chemistry major, and am taking modern physics as a supplement. I think if I were reading the book alone, and didn't have a teacher to re-explain everything, I probably would not have been able to comprehend some of the derivations. Also, My teacher often points out things that are incorrect in the figures. The book is not 100% terrible, but can be hard to follow and requires constant concentration. If others are correct in saying this is the best modern physics book they've read, I'd hate to see some of the other stuff they've been reading."
3,Its just ok...,The book only has solutions to select problems. It didn't really help me.. I paid less for the actually textbook.
5,An AMAZING group with great potential!,"If you like the sounds of Spoon, you will love this group. A superior listen, over and over again. The rhythms, sound, and vocals are top notch. A hint of the Strokes, a pinch of Spoon, and a whole lot of WMMF talent puts together one of the best albums I've listened to in 5 years. This is the kind of band that makes Austin, the Live Music Capital of the World, proud!"
5,Tryin to Never Catch Up,This is such a great band - saw them live and they are so awesome - catch these guys any chance you get!!!
4,Eminently listenable,"The Tide opens with a hauntingly beautiful song, the title track. In track 2 (When I Get to the Border), Lucy's demonstrates that her voice is capable of a resonance and brilliance comparable to the voices of other great folk singers such as Nanci Griffith and Kate Wolf in some of their best work. In this CD, she gives us an indication that she is a true and lasting talent that ""the heart does not forget."" While there may be few songs on this CD that reach out and grab you the way that Ten Year Night and End of the Day do on her Ten Year Night CD, it does offer a very pleasurable and eminently ""listenable"" experience. Take it to work or enjoy it over a romantic dinner for two. And let's all look forward to more from Dr. Lucy Kaplansky."
5,Incredible,There are no words that can do justice to this recording. Simply one of the finest recordings I have ever heard. Just incredible.
3,typical Lucy Kaplanski,"This CD is a typical Lucy Kaplanski one. A little bit more ""country - like"" than the others, but that doesn't matter. Those, who like Lucy Kaplanski will make a good choice with this CD"
4,A good bio of Jones,I don't really expect a lot from biographies. The facts are what is necessary for me. But I did enjoy reading this book about an interesting man of letters - an enigma in the alumni of American writers to be sure. Jones life is told in a cronologically fashion with many anecdotes and quotes given of this great writer and complex man.
5,Reader's Bible,"The New Cambridge Paragraph Bible is an outstanding version. Modernized ever so slightly, but without abandoning the elegance and eloquence of the King James Version.The essential differences for this version? Single-column; unobtrusive verse numbers; no references or study notes. It reads as God's own textbook.This is not a study Bible; there are no references within the text, just translators' notes.This is, in plain terms, a reader's Bible. A Bible to be read chapter by chapter, without the distractions that are inevitable in most two-column reference or study Bibles.Make no mistake: Reference and study Bibles are essential; I own several. This new reader's Bible, however, fills a void for those who would just read and reflect on the Word."
4,Nice KJV Edition,"Depending on what you want this could be an excellent choice. The type is probably 10 or 11 point. The paragraph format and wide margin layout is superior. Original 1611 editors margin notes are excellent. Nice 20# (about) paper is perfect. Binding is a good Cambridge Morocco leather. The only possible drawback is the size of the bible. Close to two inches thick, about 10X7 on the cover makes this a little much to sit in a chair and read. On the desk or in the pulpit this is wonderful. The mild spelling updates are not deKing Jamesing so you end up not being able to detect and spelling difference from the 1769 editions we are all familiar with."
5,This is one of my favorites,This movie is amazing.. I used to own this movie a fews years ago and somehow it dissapeared out of my movie collection. :( Well when I found it on here I just had to buy it :) I havent seen this movie in probably at least 3 years I am soooo excited to watch it again. Its like your modern day romeo and juliette hispaic style... I usually dont like the hispanic movies but the first time i ever saw this one I was hooked....
4,I like this better than traditional yellow wood glue,"This glue flows better than traditional yellow glue, more like white school glue. It holds great. I have a bamboo cutting board made of probably 50 pieces of bamboo glued together. I have re-glued every joint over the last two years but never the same joint twice."
4,Swiss Army Knife,"This model of the Swiss Army Knife is just right for my application and for the people to whom I gave it for Christmas. It is big enough to handle any wood whittling project, yet not so big that it feels like a huge lump in my pocket. The small screwdriver is perfect for large Philips-Head screws and the regular screw driver is perfect for everything else. One of the ppeople to whome I gave this had not had a pocket knife in over 40 years, but he told me that he has really enjoyed carrying this knife."
5,So handy,Husband loved this gift. He has a regular size swiss but wanted a keychain one. Turns out this one is slightly larger than your regular keychain ones and he likes it much better. Does so much with it.
5,very handy,"Perfect size to carry in your pocket without bulk. Once you start carrying a pocket knife, you can't live without one. This one is a great size with features you need."
4,Good quality. Larger than I expected.,"The knife is well constructed and has sharp edges. It is slightly larger than I expected, but I still put it on my keychain because it is very handy."
3,Excellant knife for the money...,very good for the money...light to the point of almost feeling cheap (which it isnt... quality wise)the size is perfect for every day carry.A very good knife for a gift or for your self if your prone to loosing your knife.
2,Just Another Overpriced Hits Collection,"A typical ""Hits"" collection you can buy for $5-6 dollars with a different name. Don't be a sucker at this price."
4,A Great Way to Start a Lifechange,"I have studied homeopathy and holistic health so I wanted to find something in that realm that could help me with my chronic weight problems. I didn't agree with some of the techniques of the book 100%, but I thought I'd try them anyway. I was successful, but I wasn't able to make that a part of my lifechange. The part I felt helped me most was the positive affirmations. After doing some serious exercise to no avail, I decided to stop and look deeper. For five weeks I did no exercise and honestly wasn't that conscious about what I ate. No binging, just not always the healthiest of choices. I did do the positive affirmations every night before bed. I lost 15 pounds. Sometimes the emotional ""crap"" we hold onto can be the extra weight we're holding onto. Let it go. All in all, fantastic to find a book that took a holistic approach to this problem."
4,"motivating, but not homeopathic","I really enjoyed reading this book. The author is upbeat and follows an easy, common sense approach to weight loss. I was a little confused as to why homeopathy was mentioned in the title though. The author doesn't recommend any remedies except a homeopathic remedy for worms. She only recommends going to a homeopath. However, she still gives a lot of good information and the book is enjoyable and motivating."
1,A weak offering,"Cute rather than funny, this film is a very weak offering from Doris Dorrie. Her films ""Men"" and ""Money"" are much better. These films frame Dorrie's comic sensibility with a wicked irony. The editorial description here at Amazon says ""Me and Him"" is based on an Italian story. But if you're looking for a great Italian slapstick comedy, I recommend ""Johnny Stecchino,"" directed by Roberto Benigni."
5,great case for the price,The Protec Clarinet Case cover is a great value. It fits my old Buffet R13 case very well and seems durable and is certainly functional with ample storage for music. Why spend more?
3,OK,"This was a ok book. Not as good as The Irish Devil. AS with most, the second book pales in comparison to the first."
1,A Disapointment,"I read the first book the Irish Devil and it was great. So I was looking forward to this one and was sooo disapointed. The story was really weak. The charactors talked about love all the time and that ruined the story for me. Here is a Fierce warrior concern in finding or never finding love. Not believable. And the Hope story line was aweful. I just kept clicking the pages to get through it all. The ending was never coming!!! And Hope was really annoying me with ""He doesn't love me attiude""."
4,Great reference for any new hospice nurse.....,"Although I have been a icu nurse for the past 20 years, I am new to end of life care. This book is with me for reference. I am becoming more informed each day. I especially like the fact I can research a symptom and then treat it without delay. The lay out of the book is easy to follow with fifteen of the most common symptoms experienced with the dying."
3,USENET,I am hoping to find a book that will let me set up a server similar too deja-talkway-remarq. Any suggestions?
5,Nice pictures and great description,"The book has alot of interesting plants, many of them tropical. My only complaint is that it didn't have many North American trees."
3,No mention of the California Oaks,"This book is worthless in regards to the oak trees of California. There is no mention of the oaks in California. I handle the Vegetation Management Program for San Diego County Parks and I was hoping to use this book with the public to show them the trees that are being infected and killed by the Gold Spotted Oak Borer. Since this book does not mention the Oaks of California, it's useless to me.It does get 3 stars because it does a good job in describing other trees (Non California Oaks)."
3,Great Looking Book,"This is a great looking book on cross-country skiing. Color photos and superb layout. It is one of the nicest books for beginner and novice skiers.Better skiers are going to find it weak on technical content with most of the explainations taking a certain artistic licence at the expense of accuracy. Two books advanced skiers should look into are ""Tao of Sking"" and ""Ski Skating With Champions."""
3,Good basic,This book begs to be picked up. The photos are beautiful. Why 3 stars? Because there are simply too many errors in the actual ski techniques to get you past novice.
1,if it looks like it's too good to be true...........,"I purchased the Villaware Flatbread maker with the idea of a machine that would be easy to use and would be economical.I used it twice to make sure that I was doing it right and still did not perform well.It said make tortilla dough into 2"" balls,which I did,and the tortilla ended up being about 5 or 6"" upon completion.I never could get the dough to be thin enough.I had such high hopes.I definitely would not reccommend this product,(I wish I had thought to go to Amazon for cutomer reviews,before I purchased this)Dissapointed in Chula Vista"
1,a dud,"This machine is a dud. No matter how one tried, it does notproduce decent tortillas - either wheat or corn, following the instructions carefully. Moreover,after using it three times, the handle broke. Save your money.Go the supermarket and buy all the ready made tortillas youwant."
2,Makes good 8 inch tortillas,Simply put; the product will make rather good 8 inch tortillas. I have had no success making larger tortillas.
1,Expensive and of no use : DO NOT BUY,"I paid $[...] for this and this product is a crap. Tried every trick listed here and elsewhere, but did not do what it was supposed to do (make tortillas). DO NOT BUY."
1,This is not a good product,"Hi allThis is not a good product , i returned it back to amazon.i got money back with no issues. I won't recomand this product those who want make chapathi/roti making."
3,Indian breads with the tortilla maker,"I bought the tortilla maker to make (rather roll) indian breads such as rotis, puris etc.Cons: the rotis dont really spread out big, not more that 6 inches in diameter.Pros: its great for puris though. I use it to only press the rotis and then I bake them on the pan as you would normally. Its great for rolling and saves you a lot of time.Ps: If you follow the instructions as in the manual you might end up with a ""wheat cracker"" rather than a roti. Hope this helps!"
5,Makes amazingly thin roti/tortillas quickly without sticking,I have used another tortilla maker before this and it had only one hot plate and the tortillas used to stick to one of its place. Making tortillas was a test of patience with a thick and nonuniform thickness tortillas coming out after 45 seconds to 1 minute of hard work. With this tortilla maker it only takes 5 seconds and a roti/tortillas as thin as a professional can make comes out. I'll definitely recommend this product for anyone.
1,This totallly sucks!! never buy it...,"This is a total waste of money.. I dreamt of making chapatis and flat breads easily with this one but it totally sucks... no matter how mcuh care you take to mix the dough it never ocomeout well... I should have returned it, I delayed it and it was my mistake...NEVER BUY IT!!"
1,This is exasperating!!,"I've used this thing twice to make sure that I was doing it right and still did not perform AT ALL. It said make tortilla dough into 2"" balls, which I did, the tortilla ended up being about 5 or 6"" upon completion and very thick and chewy. Now those are the ones that didn't blow apart in the machine - there were about 20 of those. I made enough dough to make about 50 tortillas and didn't end up with even one that was good. I'm so disappointed! I definitely would not recommend this product, (and I even read the customer reviews before I purchased this) some of you are lying!!! This thing does NOT work!!"
1,Waste of time and money.,It is much easier to do it manually than trust this thing. Inspite of all the skewed reviews i still thought i would give it a shot as i had used something similar to this before where the tortilla's ( chapatti indian style)would puff. But in this machine it was impossible to even flatten the dough ball properly. Took too much time. A complete waste. I returned it.
5,It is great!,I bought this for my boyfriend as a gift. He loves it. We are eating lots of tortillas. I am very happy about my purchase. So does my boyfriend. :):)
4,it is not excellent but pretty good,"I brought this primarily to make chapathi (indian tortilla kind of thing). It is very helpful to make the dough roll flat by pressing it. I usually preheat this for 10 min and then make it flat. I primarily use it to make it flat. You can use it to bake it as well but it gets too dry and crispy which I dont want my chapathi's to be. So after I make it flat to my desired thinness or if the bread starts cracking after it looses all the steam, then I quickly transfer it into a heated flat pan. It takes only 30 sec after to swell and bubble up and my chapathi's are ready. Overall it takes less than a 45 sec to a minute once my dough balls are ready to make them flat and cook them on flat pan. Again as I said I use it only to make the dough flat."
3,good for flattening dough but...,"Good for flattening balls of dough, but doesn't live up to the promise of cooking rotis. Doesn't provide the heat necessary to puff the rotis."
5,It is all in the dough,"We tried making this several times with the recipe and the directions in the book, plus several other recipes and we did not succeed at all.We went to Don Pablo's resturant, and we watched them make it and they told us that they put in a flour conditioner. The best that we could come up with was wheat gluten. I made the recipe up that was in the book but I added 1 tsp of wheat gluten and mixed it in my mixer for 4-5 minutes. I let it rest for 2 hours or longer, and then made them up.Sweet success.Make sure that you press for only a second or two lift and turn, then repress. Use the paddle so that it flattens it well. Do this several times until you get the desired thickness and size. Continue baking it on the griddle, but leave it open. Cook it for several minutes, and turn over and finish cooking. It really does do well!!!"
1,Waste of money,"Making tortillas the ""old-fashioned"" way is easier and produces a better product. I purchased this thinking that it would make at least adequate tortillas faster. After reading the reviews of others who have been successful, I have decided to continue trying; I've only tried 8 batches so far, using three different recipes. I would not recommend this product to anyone."
2,Definitely not what I thought,"I was able to make tortillas with this but the insides of them were very tough. The outside was fine but the inside was like plasti-rubber. The quality of the product construction and materials is not that great due to using plastic where ever possible. After a few uses, one of the plastic tabs used to apply the initial pressing pressure has become loose. I fear this will break soon."
2,Chappati maker,"The product is built well but it did not make the Indian style chappati/Roti which is very similar to tortilla properly.I made the dough with varying water content but was unable to make a roti which was nice to eat. The taste was also shall I say gross. I purchased this item to cut my time for making roti. I made a valiant attemt to appreciate the finished product. Nevertheless, I was well convinced that it was not worth keeping. Amazon was nice and take it back. I payed for the return shipping."
5,Beast Wars is Nostalgia,"You will NOT be disappointed with this box set of the first season of Beast Wars. I was in nostalgia-land the entire time I watched it. I have to say though, I received it as a birthday present from my girlfriend last year and she paid about $50 bucks for it, brand new. It's up for $114 right now, so maybe shop around a bit?"
5,1st season worste season,"Beast wars season one has a feel that it is getting it feet under it. You are not sure if the series wants to be a childrens show or a nostalgic flash back to the generration one charcters. However the series decides not to pander to childer and instead starts to make several incredible decisions about the series.1. It will be set up for adults. As such characters will die.2. Moral issues will be faught and sometimes good will do ""evil"" acts to survive.3. Every episode will build on each other. Their is an incredible continuity that is started in season one. This continuity is carried all the way into season three.4. Scale, reality, and believable sci-fi are present in the show. Things happen due to a scientific reason. This may be a fantastical science as we see but they still make the show as hard edged as possible.All in all a great season.Enjoy:David"
3,ol memories,wow what do i say i was born in 1990 and this was my favorite show and cheetor was my favorite now that im in high school i dont care what people think if i say that this and the orignal power rangers are cool p.s. im sad megatron had to steel a win at the last sec of season 3 i wanted him to kill monkey boy and rule with a solid victory
3,Maximize! Terrorize!,"Even though I love the original Transformers the best, I liked this series mostly because of the voice actors and I was very disappointed that there were no interviews with the actors, which is why the lower rating!! Or at least have a behind the scenes look at how the series was made!! Other than my disappointment with the extras, it's nice to have the series on Dvd. Hopefully Beast Machines will be released in the futre as well."
5,Maximize!!!!,"i have loved beast wars since it first came out!!! i made sure that i would be home to watch it even at odd hours. i cannot, i mean CANNOT wait for seasons two and three to come out!!! the 2nd and 3rd season were where beast wars shined!!!!!! Transformers has stuck with me ever since i the beginning and it never let me down!!"
4,Could be better,"This game was okay, but it wasn't as excciting as I thought it would be. Though the graphics were good there just wasn't alot to do."
5,kickin' it,"Jules and George had outdone themselves this time.This is definetly worth your money.If this is what the island is all about im definetly there this year.I have this album like a year and a half and its never boring.Not a very comercial songs in it but it will definetly get you going with the likes of {Murk,Danny J Lewis,Ronaldo,Carolyn Harding,Spacebass etc.}.Perfect stuff."
5,Great Album,Meph puts out a great record with their own blend of Ska/Jazz. It is a great record. This band is very talented and any ska fan should certainly buy this CD.
5,Fishing Rod Rack,This product was delivered quickly and exactly as described. It is a great clutter controller. Now my son knows exactly where his fishing rods are and they are all in good order. Great product!
4,good trance!,"It all started a few years back, when I heard this great trance song on an underground radio station. The dj's name Gary D. I asked my friends, none of them ever heard about it, I looked on the internet, and music stores and found nothing. I finally saw several albums on amazon, so I had to get them. It started with this one, I am not a very big trance fan, but this had me. The great beats and melodic tones are fabulous. A 3 cd set with one mixed cd which is found on mp3 sites a lot. It gets you dancing, ready to go to the european clubs, because you don't find that good of trance here. A dj that has been around, you just don't here about, but way better than the mainstream dj's of today, good trance!"
2,Not Too Useful...,"After having lived in Japan and interacted with Japanese on a daily basis, as well as a good dose of Japanese television and movies, I can tell you that most of the phrases in the book are just not used, are probably outdated, or even taken from obscure dialects. If you are looking for a good book on Japanese 'slang', I'd reccomend ""Kansai Japanese"" by Peter Tse - while not really 'slang' per se, it is one of the most interesting and lively dialects in Japan, and more useful than any of the 'slang' found in this book.."
1,Outdated,"When I read this book seven years ago and tried to use some of the new words I learned on some Japanese friends of mine, the only reactions I got were blank stares. I showed them the book and the words, and they still had no idea what I was talking about. I highly suggest staying away from this book. There are better ways to learn slang, like from real Japanese people. Japanese comics, or manga, are also a great source that I recommend for people wanting to learn slang."
3,Hmmm. PG-13,"I got this book thinking it a lot of stuff like ""Whatsup?"" and similar to that. Well, i got the book, so excited, and i read in it, probably 5 pages in the whole book was stuff you will see everyday, and the rest of the book was about sex terms. It was a bit too PG-13. This is a great book if you need a hooker or something. Less likely you will use these words everyday in Japan. It might be good, if you are just looking forward to extending your Japanese vocabulary, but otherwise, i would consider getting ""Dirty Japanese: Everyday Slang from ""What's Up?"" to ""F*%# Off!""""this is probably the best slang book you can get. (:"
3,Not the Best,"If I had to recommend a book of Japanese slang to someone, this book probably wouldn't show up near the top of my list. It's very vulgar, repetitious, and outdated. I'm sure there are better rescources out there to use than this one."
3,Ok...,"So I open the book and start reading... Most of the slang words are EXTREMELY vulgur, and there are no cuss words. (I bought this product so that if I ever go to Japan, I'll know when people are cussing me out or calling me rude things that the beginner's book wouldn't have taught me.) Almost all the terms are very sexual and just... Disgusting. So if you want to know that kind of stuff, then this book is for you, but if you're like me and just wanting to know when someone is being rude to you, don't buy it!"
2,Is this written by a dirty little boy with a filthy mind?,"I have to echo some of the other reviewers' comments and say that some of my Japanese collegues have never heard a few of the phrases in this book. I did find some interesting phrases in this book that I could not get from a dictionary. But one thing has to be said: this book is mostly just a collection of vulgarity and obscenity. I wouldn't recommend it, even for that. You might as well just go and buy a porn mag."
3,Not Part 3 of Alex and Catherine's Story,"This book really stands on it's own. In fact, I think it might have been better if I had not already read The Pride of Lions and The Blood of Roses (which I thought were absolutely brilliant) since those two books charted the very same territory in regards to the 1745 Highlander uprising. Nothing seemed fresh about story of the battles fought, and I struggled a bit to enjoy the romance aspect of the story too. I wasn't sure exactly who I was to want Anne to love. I finished the book very sad that it wasn't John."
2,The Blood of Roses all over again...,"After reading The Pride of Lions & The Blood of Roses I was hoping to follow Catherine & Alexander again in this 3rd book. This book follows Angus Moy, Lady Anne & John MacGillivray basically through the exact same events that you already went through in The Blood of Roses. There really weren't any surprises since you'd already been through the battle in the other book & you already knew who lived & who died. In The Blood of Roses I felt very drawn in by all the characters & not just Alex & Catherine so I didn't see why these 3 weren't given a bigger role in the other book (like many others had) which would've eliminated a need for this 3rd book in the series. With about 95% of this book being the march to battle & the actual battle itself that you've already read in The Blood of Roses I see no need for anybody to read this book. I could've got all that I needed by just reading the last 2 chapters. Don't waste your time if you've already read The Blood of Roses."
4,A new view on Atlantis,"The author of this book has revealed to the reader a new light on the myth of Atlantis. Reading the previous review I was disappointed to see how D. Hill felt.Much like the scriptures in ancient mythology to the Biblical Canon, mankind has taken it upon themselves to analyze every line of this literature and take every word literally. Alan Alford attempts a new approach, explaining that Atlantis may in fact not be a real island but instead a story and only a story (I do not wish to spoil the material to the potential buyer).A. Alford continues on attacking alternative and orthodox beliefs (and research) of Atlantis, claiming the individuals to only take Plato's writings on the location and size of the island while also ignoring the war and the mythology of the people during the time.For the mythical island seeker, I would highly recommend this book. It is not a disappointment as D. Hill claims it to be."

5,works great stops the itch,"trialed this product from a groomer. worked great. it's the only shampoo i'll use.stopped the annoying and constant itching, no perfume smell. great product."
1,Drymate whelping box liner,"I would not recommend this product for a whelping box liner for newborn pups. After just a few hours of use, the green fabric started to pill and fuzz. The pups claws caught on it and caused it to fuzz. The mom's digging (ie; nest building) also caused it to pill/fuzz badly. This fuzz got into the scabs of their dew claw wounds and the mother tracked the fuzz all over the house. Even after washing, the pilling/fuzz did not go away. I really loved the tacky, rubber backing and wished it had a different fabric on top. For half the price, I would recommend the EZWhelp Washable Whelping Pad. Just wish it had the tacky, rubber backing that this product did. Someone needs to combine the top of the EZWhelp with the bottom of the Drymate and we would have the perfect whelping box liner!"
5,"Wow! I wish I bought this liner MUCH earlier! Pups are dry, which means less chance of infections and illness, rashes etc!","This stuff works! I love the 2 pads I bought - one to throw in the wash, the other is in the pen and I rotate them! I wish they sold this by the bolt, I'd buy a whole bolt or 3!!!!"
4,Karen Penn- TCM Reviews,"Whistler's Gold has, at the heart of it, a love story.Grace Garretson and Kee Notah meet at school, fall in love, marry and raise a daughter. The love story itself is enjoyable, but Whistler's Gold is much more than that, with several mysteries rolling out seamlessly alongside the romance.Grace, a part-time courier driver, is one day robbed of her priceless cargo, and while trying to reclaim something that was stolen from her mother during the attack, their thirteen year old daughter Rena discovers the answer to a secret that stretches back 400 years.Wayne Winterton has managed to blend the genres of mystery and romance together in a book that is entertaining on many levels.I look forward to reading more books by Mr. Winterton."
1,Product sent is not as described or pictured,"I ordered this product which was titled, described, and pictured as a 5 pack of the Miele Style K/K Intensive Clean Vacuum Bags. This company pulls a switch and sends a 5 pack of the Miele KK ""Original"" Style Bags. The Skew numbers printed on the box have been deliberately taped over and replaced with a Skew number for the ""Intensive"" Clean Vacuum Bags. I am returning. Buyer beware!"
1,"Watch out for ""Sunset Vac""","I ordered the K/K/Intensive Clean bags and received the ""original"" standard vacuum cleaner bags. Please note that Amazon fulfilled this order through Sunset Vacs. I've ordered again from, I hope, another of Amazon's sellers. We'll see what happens when this next pack of bags come in. On your final order review, be sure to check Amazon's seller carefully. They are often not the seller posted on the website."
3,Wesley falls in love!,"This is a stellar episode of the second season. The Enterprise beams aboard a beautiful woman who is destined to rule an alien planet. Wesley Crusher has a chance encounter with her and falls in love with her, much to the disapproval of the girl's caretaker. This episode gets especially suspensful when Wes learns that the woman he's fallen in love with isn't what she appears to be."
3,Scariest drawing of a baby ever,"If this is the book I think it is, it has the most terrifying drawing of a baby EVER on its cover. It could do duty as the infant Antichrist. Pure nightmare fuel. It's a disconcerting combination of smugness and I WILL DEVOUR YOUR SOUL.I've never actually read it so I can't say anything about the content."
2,NOT INTENSIVE CLEAN BAGS for odor control!,"The bag pictured is the ""old"" bag for which I have been searching everywhere and can not find! This is not that bag!!!I guess Miele doesn't make them any more? The bag that was sent to me is the newer one with the red ring and these bags are awful. They are useless for odor control. The old bags combined with the use of the charcoal filter are amazing for pet owners needing odor control who do not want the entire house smelling like the dog's bed when vacuuming! (And I love a pile of smelly dog feet!)The sellers should know their products as well as the consumers if not better and update their product photos!"
3,"received ""original"" and not the ""intensive clean""","I'm torn. I want to give 5 stars for the product, but 1 star for what I received.Like another buyer, I received the wrong item, the red flapped ""original"" version instead of the ""intensive clean"" ones in the listing. The ones I ordered were sold by ""Chad M. Brownfield"" and shipping fulfilled by Amazon. So maybe it is just a problem with that one seller?But Amazon aside, I have been using the ""intensive clean"" bags for several years without a problem and highly recommend them."
5,Better than what I expected,"I have never seen New Order live, but had read comments on what they were like on stage. Although they are not the most exciting band to see live, they sure put on a show on this DVD. It was better thant what I expected!!! And the DTS sound makes it even better. Definitely a GREAT buy for New Order fans, especially if you have never seen them live (like myself)."
2,"a good collection of songs, but...","this is not a satisfying DVD for the New Order fan. my chief complaint is that it was filmed primarily during daylight hours. New Order has spent years refining their stage show, and the lighting that accompanies a New Order show greatly enhances the experience...especially with the almost signature ""New Order blue"" lighting scheme that brings even more to the sensory experience. secondly, i don't care, even a little bit, about mud covered drunk morons...and i really don't want to have them occupying half my screen during the best parts of a truly great song like ""Temptation""...this is just offensive and stupid. overall, this release reeks of indifferent production and design, although the band itself is obviously having a good time and the twilight rendition of ""Your Silent Face"" nearly redeems this otherwise forgettable insult to any fan (and, hence, the second star)."
2,Sad Show.,"I read the reviews that said that this was a great DVD. Unfortunately, it not. New Order filmed an awful show. I've want to see them live since 86, but I would not go to see them now after seeing this DVD. They did not really seem to be trying. I do not recommend buying this or even renting it."
4,"arrived quickly, nice for the $$","I originally thought that this product was not as nice as described or expected, but after comparing to others in stores, I find that the flag is nice quality for the price. I still don't know if it will last 1 year outside...only time will tell. Shipped quickly, and when I first commented that flag was not as nice as expected, the seller promptly called to see what he could do to meet my expectations. You don't find that kind of customer service much anymore. I would buy a similar product from this vendor again."
5,Great Quick Reference,"These charts are great. I'm currently finishing massage school and we have these, along with other charts, on the walls. They are great for quick reference, or for your client to quickly point out where it hurts so you can remedy the problem faster. When I decorate my massage studio, I will have these charts and I'll have flip charts for more in depth trigger point work."
4,Battle of Britain add on,"For an add-on, scenery, planes, handling and flight characteristics all good and fun. Only complaint is that the games being played crash often and I get the ""Microsoft-sorry-there-is-a-problem-and-we-must-exit-now"" routine way too often. Is very disheartening when you have just shot down 21 bombers and are headed home...then get nothing but a black screen and no credits for your great flying. I fly about 10 different games/add-ons, and this is only one that does that. BUT..I still play it for kicks!"
1,DISASTER.......,"I am sorry to say this purchase was a total waste of money. I accept some of the blame. I purchased this game not knowing that it was actually an ADD-ON game to an early version of ""Combat Flight Simulator"". I purchased Battle of Britain as a stand alone game...this obviously was not going to work. Having opened the package and reading the instructions I thought that it may work as I do have Combat Flight Simulator 3. This is not the case... Now the game required is no longer available, so I am left with a game that is absolutely useless. I emailed my issue to Amazon and was informed that I could return the item but having destroyed the packaging and the cost of returning the game to the USA, I chose not to do so.I guess it's a case of ""buyer beware"" and make sure you understand all the instructions."
1,PEOPLE SAY,"People SAY THAT SKIL tools are fairly good products, and I would agree to that except, when it comes to their sanders that use the loop and hook (Velcro) backing. Now I don't know if all sanders of this type possess the same problem but,,, they cannot make the sandpaper backing last long enough to get the mileage out of the sandpaper. And if you look at the price of this sanding material...it's not cheap, in fact it's downright expensive......So go figure sp-ending 30-50 bucks on paper to last you on a project. . .get the picture.??"
1,Stupid.,"One word for korn, stupid. I think korn needs to watch there mouths. For all parents out there this is not a 12 or under CD. A discrace to music."
1,"Squeaky, slow and troublesome","I have had this shredder for about 4 months now, and wish I hadn't bought it. I find that it squeaks while working, (real annoying), sounds labored even with a single sheet of 24 lb. paper, and that the shredded material clogs around the cutters. Clearing this makes the labored part go away for a sheet or two, but not the squeak. I have purchased, for 25 percent of the cost of the shredder, the lubrication sheets from Staples. It is real annoying to have to reverse the shredder mid shred and have the partially shredded material reverse back up the slot. Then, you have to turn the shredder over and clear out the jam of shredded paper. Where do you think the material that backed through the slot goes? Right....all over the floor. That was Easy!"
2,Good while it lastest,Was a great shredder but soon I was not able to leave it on Auto or it would start shredding on its own. Now it is strictly a manual paper shredder and sounds like it is working hard to complete a 4 paper task.10.15.06Replaced the shredder today. Doesn't even make a great trash can. Little bits of paper fall out of mesh. :(
3,Just Like I Remember,"... including the lousy reception with ""rabbit ears."" These are degraded recordings carelessly transferred to DVD; but all the pirates, smugglers, spies, and con-men are there, just like I (sort of) remember them. This is all that seems to be left of a great series. Pity."
1,Not viewable! Poor quality copies!,I purchased the 3 volumes of Cd's and they are terrible! Not viewable!My requests for returns/exchanges went ignored! Don't buy these. You'll be ripped off.
3,Close but no cigar,The disc I received is not the one pictured. I will keep it because it has some of the episodes that I don't have from Disc set 1
4,An open can of whupass,"I've been a fan of the action genre for ages now. Clay Harvey does an admirable job of creating compelling characters with a true sense of humor. I got a kick out of the dialogue and chuckled quite a bit during the book.But not to worry. Clay Harvey delivers action in spades. He obviously knows what he writes of. The action is quick and pared down with an intense, you are there sort of feel. Kind of like if John Woo had picked up the pen instead of the camera.In short, I've read all three of the books in this series and my only complaint is that Clay doesn't write fast enough to suit me!"
4,Quick Reading; Fast Action; Good Humor,"This book is a sequel to ""A Flash of Red"". I did not read the first book and I feel I missed a little something (which makes me want to purchase the first). The characters come to life in this book. The dialoge is written, such that I can understand who these characters are and relate them to people I know. It is this dialoge that makes for the quick reading. During the action scenes you will be hard pressed to put the book down. Harvey does not over detail the action that takes place, thus action is fast and enticing. His two main characters display a smart alec personality that is reminicent of people I know. This leads to a humorous book that reads quick."
1,the difference between a book and a piece of wood,"My God, I didn't know writing could be so...bad.Almost painful in its mediocrity, this book's protagonist actually had me cheering for the Serbs in the hope that a well-aimed bullet would rid the world of further adventures ""written"" by Harvey (who was a lot more convincing when he was a huge invisible rabbit)."
4,Like Listening to a Member of the Family Share His Soul,"This CD was wonderful! I was pleasantly surprised at the quality of the vocals and guitar. There was a ""sit in your living room and sing"" quality about this that makes me want to hear it over and over. I recommend this to anyone who just wants to express what's in their heart and may not have the courage to do so."
5,One to Share with Friends,"I'm usually a ""nibbler"" at books, reading a little now and a little later, whenever I have time, but with Cetacea I kept reading practically without pause. This was an interesting, informative book with exotic locales, well-developed characters, dramatic tension, and realistic dialogue. For the duration of the story, I felt as if I were in it -- seeing, feeling, hearing it all. Besides the gripping story line, Theresa Foley has called up an intriguing image of Key West that makes me want to visit her island at the southeast tip of the United States and perhaps do some dolphin-watching, myself. This is one of those enjoyable books that I'm sharing with my friends!"
5,Captivating,"You don't have to know Key West to enjoy this novel by an exciting new novelist because the drama beginning on page one quickly encaptures you. One of these ""I couldn't put it down"" books. Ms. Foley takes an allegation of training dolphins (cetacean) to kill and writes an intriguing mystery involving national and international politics mixed with adventures of the sea, including sailing and diving, plus a love story to capture your heart. Ms. Foley's skill in developing the characters is exceptional and the dialogue allows you to easily enjoy the story as it unfolds throughout the book to a climatic unexpected ending. Clearly the potential for a movie or TV special."
2,Not what I expected,"I originally expected a full 8 a.m. to 7 p.m. calendar per the original picture. However, when it arrived it came with 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. Not what I expected."
1,Sky Scan stopped working,The outdoor sending unit stopped working after 6 months.Called the 800 unmber on the back of the unit. Theyhave no warranty and could 'care less'.
2,Batteries not included,"This product claims that batteries are included. I found no batteries anywhere, and yes I checked the enclosure inside the product. Also the clock is screwed into the packaging. You have to unscrew it with a screw driver to get this thing out of the packing, which has been reinforced heavily around the screws. The screws themselves are made of a cheap metal that makes it possible to dent the metal if using a incorrectly sized driver and at that point it becomes impossible to remove without permanently damaging the clock housing. Good for them if they are worried about it being stolen off a shelf, not so good for anyone legitimately purchasing it."
3,manufacturer not responding to emails,"The batteries fell out of my Equity clock, which is not the wall clock mentioned above. It just happens to be an Equity clock. After reinserting the batteries, I haven't been able to get the clock to set properly, even after pressing the reset button. I've emailed the company twice and have had no response.There is no model number on the clock I purchased and I have since thrown away the paperwork."
3,Outdoor remote a joke,"This is the third atomic clock with outdoor temp and the first from skyscan I have purchased (mainly as gifts)...I can tell you that there are more dependable atomic clocks (esp. in regard to the outdoor temp.) out there for less than the cost of this one. IF, however, the outdoor temp sensor actually worked well this clock would probably deserve 4 out of 5 stars...it does sync, the numbers are big, and it is relatively easy to use."
5,Works better than expected,"I bought today a similar SkyScan .... I installed the batteries and didn't even bother to set the time: 10 minutes later the clock set date and time automatically! I live in the Sierra foothills, the worst place for the radio reception. Yet this thing tuned in without a problem, and it wasn't even midnight (the manual says that the best reception is between 12AM and 3 AM, but it worked for me at 6PM). So far so good."
1,The Automatic Clock That Wasn't,"We do not have this exact clock. We have model number 86175.However, this one is the closest in appeareance to ours. This clock never sets itself. Every year I have had to set it manually. In fact it says the time is 11:50 P.M. as I write this and the correct time is 7:46 P.M.I did not purchase the clock. My father did before he passed away. Therefore, I went to the net to get instructions for it. I thought I was doing somthing wrong.Only to find that the company that is selling these:1. Does not have Model 86715 listed2. Does not have any support pages on their web site.What I have read on the Net is that most people can not get these clocks to work.What do you expect from a product made in China."
1,Atomic clock,I received the clock I ordered but I wanted the outside temperature on it. Sorry I most return my order. Do you have the same clock with the outdoor temp. on it?Janet Brehmer
1,SkyScan Atomic Wall Clock review,Maybe it's just me but the Date on the clock changes constantly. The time is on the spot but the calender updates itself to random years. I have to set the calender every few days/weeks. Will not buy this again nor recommend to others. I don't know why people gave it 5 stars. I've been using this for 6 months now. Will upgrade to better one.
1,Sky Scan Clock/Thermometer,"I purchased these clocks for their thermometers. They were mounted inside on the window frame to indicate the incoming air temp. If the incoming air went above 75 degrees, I switched to A/C. Both units failed in less than 6 months. I replaced them with Sonalerts, attached to thermostats. I added an LM555 timer; so, they only beep once every 2 minutes."
3,Wanting to keep the exact time,I was intrigued the the Atomic clock's claim to set it self to the exact time/date but found that my clock's ability to find a signal lacking. The logo of a satellite dish is misleading since no satellite is involved and the clock is dependent on receiving an AM signal all the way from Colorado. Having no external antenna makes it difficult to find this signal. Be prepared to use this product on manual which means this clock is like any other except more expensive
4,Good clock with a fix for the temperature sensor,I received a similar (but not identical) SkyScan clock from Sams Club about 1.5 years ago. It's worked great up until last week. The outside temperature sensor stopped working. I replaced the batteries and that didn't seem to help. After contacting Eddie at Impact Merchandising (the distributor of SkyScan products) he emailed me with a fix. What you have to do is take out the batteries from both the clock and the temp sensor. Leave them out for AT LEAST 15 minutes. Then make sure you place new fresh batteries in the temp unit first. Then place new batteries in the clock. (DO NOT TRY TO SET THE TIME OR PRESS ANY BUTTONS ON THE CLOCK). Place the two units 3-5 feet apart. You should get a signal within 15 minutes. If not repeat the process once. If that doesn't fix the clock you can purchase a new temp sensor for $5 directly from them. Their contact info is :Equity Time6262 Patterson Pass Rd. Suite CLivermore Ca 94550(925) 373-9700
3,Install-and-forget clock,"The feature of never having to set this clock is, needless to say, pretty cool. The date and day of the week are also helpful. The indoor temperature is less helpful -- my heading and A/C pretty much take care of that.The one thing I find irritating about this clock is that it has a very small viewable angle. That is, if you look at it from more than, say 25 degrees off the normal, all of the digit segments are about equally dark, making the time impossible to read. I'm sure the clock would be nice on a desktop, but on the wall it's not so helpful."
5,Love this series,"I watched the Rat Patrol as a young boy and it was one of my favorite shows of all times. It's a shame the shows produced today pale in comparison. Now with this DVD collection, I can re-watch the episodes all over again with my family. My kids already want a Christopher George hat."
5,Rats on Patrol,I remember watching this series when I was a kid. Never dreamed I would get to see any of these episodes again. The imagination of Hollywood lets them pull off some pretty incredible stuff. I've watched about half of the episodes and haven't had any problems with any of the disks yet. I bought the series for a very low price and think it's a great deal.
4,a nice blast from the past,"My dad and I used to watch this show when it first aired. We never missed it. I have greatly enjoyed watching it again and it's just as good now as I remember it being way back when. For those who are World War II buffs, it is a wonderful experience and a very reasonably priced set to add to the collection."
5,The Rat Patrol Series,I bought this series as a gift for my husband. He loves any kind of war movies. So I was pleased when I found the Rat Patrol on Amazon. He was been watching from begining to the end at least twice now. And I'm sure he will watch the series over and over again.
4,glad I ordered.,"enjoy reliving your past with this complete dvd set. good quality video (hard to hear on my laptop, but sounds good on my t.v. all seasons & shows conveneintly packaged. a must have for any rat patrol fan!"
5,Great nostalgic collection to have...,I grew up watching these in reruns wherever my dad could find them. I still remember watching them on our black and white set. It's amazing how someone who passed away so long ago (Christopher George) can still come back to life on DVD. I know it isn't PC anymore but I find myself missing the Allies versus the Axis movies and TV programs.
5,"Awesome, still as good as I remember!","I watched this show growing up and as a teenage girl I loved Hitch. I have waited for years to get it on DVD and be able to watch episode when ever I want. It plays well on my computer, I can run the fight seens at 2X and still be able to see what is going on."
5,Rat Patrol Review,Great show. I loved this as a youngster and still enjoy it as an adult.Miss the action shows from the past. Reality shows can't hold a candle to theseshows.
4,The Rat Patrol; the complete series,I get these type of movies for my cousin who is a best fan of this genre. He was overjoyed with the movie. He didn't have any complaints about it. He wants to order some more movies like this from this seller. I received the DVD after I ordered in no time at all. Great customer service all around.
5,Rat Patrol Brings Back Memories,"The Rat Patrol has been a lot of fun to watch. It brings back memories, since I was 16 when it first aired."
1,Damaged item,"My husband was thrilled to receive this collection for Christmas. Unfortunately, the first DVD is damaged and we were only able to watch a few minutes of the first episode before it froze and would not continue. We tried to play the DVD on another player with the same result. As soon as I find the paperwork, we are returning it. Very disappointing!"
4,Better when I was a kid.,I watched this show every time it was on when I was a kid and thought it was just the greatest thing. I guess it was a great show for it's time. Now 40+ years later it's not quite as entertaining as I remember it being. It does bring back some fond memories and the videos are done nicely. The picture quality and the sound is very good.The packaging was nicely done and overall I am pleased with the collection. I give it 4 stars. I suppose when I was a kid 2 jeeps with 30 cal. machine guns defeating columns of enemy vehicles supported by infantry units while never receiving a scratch was entirely possible.
5,Rundgren & Hall & Oates,"This album should have been released with the names Rundgren & Hall & Oates across the top. It's just Todd all over. ""Lead guitar, back ground vocals, etc."" is the way it is listed in the credits. I'll say etc. He also ""produced, engineered & supervised"" the whole thing. What great wax. In my openion the best by Hall & Oates. I still don't understand why there has never been an American release of the CD. The quality of this import CD is high and the sound sharp. Through out the disc you are introduced to a bizarre list of characters such as a madman and his wife, a TV eye, a rose tattoo, a wide range of wacked out rock n rollers and of corse the War Baby himsef. It is well worth tracking down someone with the LP size cover to read the liner notes. A story for every song. I have this CD filed under Rundgren right after Something / Anything, A Wizard A True Star and the Todd album. If you like those three, you'll love this."
5,War Babies,"I owned this album on plastic when it first came out, and lost it. I looked in stores for years and was convinced it was no longer available, until now.This is is vintage Hall and Oates from the early seventies. This album followed their classic ""Abandoned Luncheonette"" and was produced by Todd Rundgren, who contributes to the futuristic, spacey, sound that the duo took on at the time. The title track is my favorite, with a haunting melody and the trade mark harmonies that make Hall and Oates possibly the best duo ever. There's a ballad called ""Im Watching You"" with Daryl singing lead that has enough soul for the entire cd. If you are a Hall and Oates fan, this is mandatory for your collection. The songs are raw, with basic instrumentation, but the genius is there.You have to hear it!"
3,Stay with it and you'll get it.,"I love H&O. Let me get that out of the way. I think they're really good, and I'm glad that recently there has been a renewed interest in their music. This cd, though, simply is just not a five star cd. It starts out, particularly the first four songs, as a two-star cd, before it starts to get good, in my opinion. But it does get good, make no doubt about it. It's obviously Rundgren influenced. You could plug him in on pretty much any of the songs and imagine his voice on it. As has been noted by other reviewers, it is hard to digest at times, but when it's hitting on all cylinders, it's a good cd. Unfortunately, it starts out so bad I can't in good faith give it higher than three stars. Call me the curve killer."
2,Not really representative of H&O,"Yes, I admit I own this album on vinyl - but the show here really belongs to Todd Rundgren & Utopia.It's not entirely a washout, but certainly the WEIRDEST record that H&O; ever made.IMHO, the best tracks here are the first two - ""Can't Stop The Music..."" and ""Is It A Star."" After that, it's all downhill.For completists only."
2,Nice Cover,"To me the term psychedelic is simply a drug connotation, meaning you'll truly enjoy this album if you're on medication. That said, the first 4 tracks are genuinely good, but the bridge to 'Is It A Star' is not for the sober. I did find the final track 'Johnny Gore & the C eaters' fun to listen to."
5,Great pump for raw water washdown on a boat!,"I bought this pump to use on our 21' landing craft research vessel. Part of what we do is take grab samples of the bottom, and needed to wash down both the sampler and the deck. This pump works great. I installed the pump in one of the aft compartments, with a short length of hose going to the filter in the motor well and another short link to go over the side. The pump primes quickly and delivers enough force to blast mud off the deck, even through the 3/4"" hose we use.As at least one reviewer noted, the picture used to show a coiled hose. This has since been removed, but it was there when I placed my order. I emailed Amazon and explained that I had not received the hose as pictured, and they immediately refunded $35!! Now that's customer service."
4,It does the job,"I purchased this wash down pump to use in that capacity but also I installed an additional valve and a Tee to use as a backup bilge pump.I have tested it out on three outings and it works great. It is not the cheapest or the most costly, but it puts out a large stream of water and does the job."
1,3 trips and broken,I ordered this pump in Jan 12 for a boat I was refurbishing. The boat was finished in April and I have been on three fishing trips and the pump is frozen up solid. I checked and AMAZON's return policy is only 30 days. Be aware.....
2,Very Unhappy!,"I am very unhappy for a few reasons. First, the pump kit did not come with all the items and acdcessories that were shown in the picture. Specifically, it did not come with the hose. Second, when I sent an email to amazon they did not respond to my complaint. Third, the amazon site does not provide you with the opportunity to contact anyone by phone in the event your email doesn't get answered. In short, I am very unhappy."
4,"Excellent Chef's knife, Santoku just so-so","This set is a great price, and the chef's knife is perfect! I am slightly disappointed in the Santoku only because it is so short. If it were the same length as the chef, it would certainly earn 5 stars. Unfortunately, if it were the same length, I bet the price would be higher.In any case, the knives are excellent quality and extremely sharp and I would recommend them as an addition to your set of knives, as they both cut well and feel great in the hand."
2,Poor steel,"I have the 8"" Traditional Chef and larger Santoku (7"", I think). I like the handles and feel of these knives but the quality of steel used is poor. They go dull very quickly and don't sharpen up as well as knives made of better steel.Check out Forschner Victorinox for some far better performing knives at very reasonable prices."
4,Calphalon Knifes,"For the cost of the knifes, they are great.The cost of shipping and handling was rude.Buy the knifes THEY ARE WORTH THE BUCK"
2,Yawn,"I had the sense, laboring through this largely uninspired effort from Mr. Cunningham, of watching a dispirited mason slowly piece together a brick wall. There is a mechanical feel to the novel, a definitive lack of whimsy, of anything even remotely resembling joy. The absence of any definitive plot line would be forgivable if the prose were more exuberant, but Cunningham's language (contrary to many of the raves on the book jacket) is stagnant, often graceless. Linguistic playfulness can, to a certain degree, sustain dull characters or an ordinary storyline. But we're not that lucky here. He gets you from A to B, but for all the tribulations endured by his characters (physical abuse, divorce, sexual awakening, infidelity) the ride is rather dull."
1,Awful,"Heavy-handed melodrama, characters on puppet strings, wave after wave of tragic plot nonsense. Awful."
2,Depressing,"This book was a gift for a friend who reported ""Good writing style. Rough content. Sometimes hard to take. Depressing."" so I decided not to read it."
5,Beautifully written and haunting book,"This is quite simply one of the finest books I've ever read. Cunningham has a fantastic talent for being able to make you empathize with his characters--even the ""bad guys."" Some people may think there's no real ""plot"" here, but whether or not that's truly the case, Cunningham does such a wonderful job at telling a story, and telling it so beautifully, there's nothing more you could ask for without over-analyzing."
2,"Flesh and Blood, but no Meat","It's an interesting title, given that there's so little of real substance here. Cunningham gets inside the characters' heads but provides their perspectives in exactly the same voice (whether age six or sixty) so that there's really little distinction among them. The narrative skips from event to event, the dialogue is sketchy and undeveloped, and the ending is so weak that I wondered whether Cunningham was just as tired as I was of the book that he suddenly yanked the plug. I got little sense from the writing of his affection for the characters, and thus was unable to muster any of my own (save for Cassandra whom I liked even if she wasn't entirely believable). Finally, I feel Cunningham really needed an editor but because he's already famous, no one dared suggest he tighten the prose; indeed, if this were a first novel I doubt anyone would have published it. Ultimately, this ""epic saga"" feels about as weighty as a bushel of marshmallows."
3,An old-fashioned saga for the masses.,"After having read Michael Cunningham's 2 masterpieces The Hours and Home at the End of the World, this long and rambling tale is a bit of a surprise and a let down. It's alternative title could be ""Anything that can go wrong in an Upper-middle class family in America"". All the elements of a made-for-TV movie are there - immigrant made good, marriage, adultery, divorce, sex, betrayal, drugs, a gay son, a cross-dresser with a heart of gold, homophobic father, tragedy, death, AIDS, coming to terms....Thankfully, Cunningham saves this tome from the grasp of mediocrity by avoiding the broad strokes that lesser writers would use on the characters. Also evident is his mastery of the language. The poetry is still there but Cunningham's talent and ambitions are better served outside the terrain of pulp fiction."
3,Emperor's New Clothes?,"I am confused about most people's points of view that Michael C. is a stunning writer (even the negative reviews tend to mention this). At least in ""Flesh and Blood"" his writing strikes me as overwrought and pseudo-""poetic"". Also, I don't get why people say the characters were well-developed; they read mostly like cartoon characters to me. Cunningham seems to be doing his self-conscious best to make a standard soap opera into ""literature"". I confess I'm only half way through but I keep feeling that I'm wasting my time. There are SO many better books to read."
2,overview of Michael Cunningham's three novels,When I read The Hours I was totally blown away by Mr Cunningham's use of language and the absolutely brilliant way in which he blended Virginia Wolf's writing and life with his characters. Seamless is what others have said and I can't agree more. Perhaps it is because Mr. Cunningham is now a more seasoned writer--but I found his earlier work disappointing.. I kept having to go back to see whether I was getting Bobby and Jonathan mixed up their voices seemed to blend. In the book Flesh and Blood I kept seeing the same themes repeated from the other books. In any case I find him to be very talented writer and am eagerly awaiting his next novel with the fervent hope that it comes up to The Hours. Evelyn Apte
5,ONE WORD - F A N T A S T I C,"I will keep it brief. You need to read this book. Personally, it has ruined me for reading anything else. This will be the standard by which you judge anything else you will ever read again."
5,terrific book,"It's a book I fell in love with from the first pages. That was a library copy, and I want to have one at home to be able to reread it every now and then. Cunningham is a great author. Too bad he has not published a new novel for a couple of years now."
5,Fantastic!,Author Michael Cunningham has put real life between the covers of a book. Reading FLESH AND BLOOD is an extraordinary experience.
3,Different,This is the first book that I have read by Michael Cunningham and would like to read another because I did enjoy his writing style. This is a book about the Stassos family who are quite dysfunctional like many families. For the most part the book is good but then it gets a bit weird. It goes on tangents about some members of the family that can hear trees and other objects that speak. Those parts just take away from the story. I did like that the the author tied together the lives of the characters and let you know what happened to them in the future.
4,An Insightful and Redemptive Read,"Great use of language and a very insightful look into a family fraught with dysfunction. Not for everyone, certainly, but the characters are sympathetic and the scope of the book is ambitious, covering 50 years and a dozen principle characters, with points of view switching throughout."
5,The Beginnings of a Great Writer,"As a first work (one of the first), these sketches bear the identifying marks of a genius in the beginning of his career.What better place to start, and what more challenging scene, than the defeat of the Russians by the British and French at Sevestopol during the same war that brought us ""The Charge of the light Brigade"" from the other side.This is obviously written by a man who had been in War, and had experiences the combination of fear, duty, and bravery that it takes to survive. The world has suffered through several more senseless wars since then, but few stories capture the truth of it all better than these."
4,"Crazy For This Album, But Not A Thriller","I like this album a lot--my only qualm is that it doesn't have the main featured song, ""Thriller"" by Michael Jackson. I was especially looking forward to buying the album for that and I'm disappointed to see it doesn't have it. Overall, though, the rest of the album is good. Pat Benatar, Rick Springfield, and Madonna just can't be beat."
5,Totally fun cd,"I saw this movie, and all the songs made me cringe in memories.. Honestly, this cd rocks. Its got all the great songs that you're ashamed to blast in the car, but you just can't help but sing along. Especially the 'burning down the house' song.. that is the best!"
4,I'm in the mid-30's and love this soundtrack,"The intelligent selection of songs has improved the movie. Obviously, the question is Where's Thriller? Big mistake not including it in the soundtrack but... Anyway, the CD have become in one of my favorites. Buy it NOW!!!! especially if you are over 30 ;)"
3,An Okay Mix of Music,"There isn't anything special about this music. It's basically your typical 80's compilation with one Liz Fare song thrown in the mix. It's a great movie, but the CD was nothing special to me."
4,For the person who wanted the commercial song,"Here's a few of the songs that were played in the trailer:Girls Just Wanna Have Fun-Cyndi Lauper, What I Like About You-The Romantics, Ice Ice Baby-Vanilla Ice and Breathe-Michelle Branch. Hope this helps. :c)"
4,Correcting an incorrect review from before,"Hey there-The soundtrack DOES include the song VIENNA which is the song by Billy Joel where Jenna goes back home again and breaks down in the closet. It's track nine. I also thought it was weird that most of the songs were from the early eighties and not the childhood time of Jenna in '87, but I was seduced anyway. Come on, you know you all were still doing that Thriller dance WAY after it wasn't cool anymore :) And yes Thriller isn't on here, but doesn't everyone have that damn record or c.d. anyway? Well maybe not anymore! :) Ha! Ha! Bottom Line-It's still a great c.d. for us 30 somethings to groove to!"
4,Great retro music!,"This soundtrack offers a great selection of (mostly) 80's hits that anyone, especially someone in his/her 30's, will love. The music was used very effectively in the movie, but you don't have to see the movie to appreciate this nice mix of songs. I especially love the inclusion of Vienna by Billy Joel and Jessie's Girl by Rick Sprigfield. If you like retro music, I recommend the soundtrack to 50 First Dates, too."
3,What about thriller???,"This is a good cd. There is a good variety of music, however, I was very disappointed that ""Thriller"" wasn't on the soundtrak. I didn't notice it when I bought it and probably would not have if I would have known."
4,Good Music...But Something Is Missing.....,"All the songs were awesome. There was a variety of artists from Vanilla Ice to Liz Phair. My perosnal favorite was ""Jesse's Girl"" by Rick Springfield. As I said, something was missing-- ""Thriller"" by Michael Jackson. It really should be on the soundtrack since it was played many times in the movie. Ohter than that this is a great soundtrack!!"
1,Missing song,"Wasn't Elton John's cover of Stevie Wonder's ""Signed Sealed Delivered"" used in the closing credits of this movie or am I thinking of a different movie? Where is that song on the soundtrack or anywhere?"
4,Jewtey,This is a nice mix of Magic Mikes' old stuff and new stuff put together with some hidden spices placed in the grooves along the way. This is a piece that you can enjoy when you are on your way home stuck in traffic.
5,Sweet & strange yet familiar.,"Who said: ""Writing about music is like dancing about architecture""? Well, they were correct. But here I go anyway.Fools rush in. Jerry Alfred's music is ahhh.... Native American roots influenced by contemporary pop sensibilities.I have two of his CDs - ""Etsi Shon"" and ""Nendaa."" Listening to them makes me wish that Jerry lived down the roadso I could go over to his house and hang out with him with our feet up by the wood stove. He must be a really cool guy. And very sensitive too. This music is familiar and gentle. I hope he continues to record and make this music for us all to enjoy."
3,Two Different Versions of TALES OF THE CITY,"This DVD version wasn't what I expected. Is there two different version of this DVD on TALES OF THE CITY? The one that a friend saw on a DVD rented from a public library is different from the one that I have just purchased.I am an actor in this film. But my scene is in the public library verson but is not in the DVD version that I have just purchased. So, I need to know where there are two different versions.Please let me know as soon as possible.Sincerely,Howard Fong"
3,"Would have been perfect, but...","To begin, I give Tales of the City itself five stars. I would give it ten if I could. I get sentimental every time I catch it on TV, loved it on PBS ten years ago and just as much now.My problem is with this DVD Collector's edition. It states very clearly on the box that this is the original, unrated, unedited version. Which is why I buy it, take it home and wait for one of my favourite scenes. Finally Brian picks up Connie Bradshaw at the Laundromat and I'm waiting for that wonderful post-coital confrontation. And I realise that the dialogue has been DUBBED OVER. Over the course of the next three hundred minutes I agonise over the several other scenes that have been cleaned up.This boxed set is beautiful. It has some wonderful extras including rehearsals and commentaries, but the dialogue has been tampered with and yes it does absolutely detract from the story"
2,The DVD issue is a rip-off.,"Ah, if only I had read these reviews BEFORE spending my money. I concur with the complaints here: the quality of the transfer is horrid, and the dialogue has been dubbed. The box states that this is the ""Complete 6-episode unedited version."" False advertising."
5,An Invitation From Mr. Maupin to Enter His Magical World.,"Mr. Maupin's ""World"" is magic. The characters populating his real-life/fantasy world are both convincing and unbelivable at the same time. I think I am very fortunate that I had never read Mr. Maupin's column, nor viewed an uncut version of the film. I say that I'm lucky because it seems that many of my fellow ""reviewers"" are so hooked on the editing/dubbing of the Author's original dialogue, that they have missed out on the Magic, set in and around 28 Barbary Lane.Whenever I want a quick dose of ""Never, Never Land,"" I skip over Peter Pan and go directly to Mr. Maupin's World. ""I have a place where dreams are born and time is never planned. It's not on any chart. You must find it in your heart... Never, Never Land"" (or is that ""Tales of the City"")?"
1,never received item,never received. Seller did refund money but I could have bought item elsewhere. It was for a gift.
5,Where was I?,"I LOVE Tales and if I could be granted one wish it would be to live at 28 Barbary Lane with Mrs. Madrigal, et al. I graduated high school in 1974 so I'm a little younger than the cast, but the times are just as I remember. Unfortunately I did not grow up in San Francisco.I especially enjoy Mr. Maupin's ""six degrees of separation"" style. For the most part each character is connected to another even though they may not be aware of it. This is even carried into his other books. For example in Night Listener, Mr. Noone's assistant originates in Tales.Casting Olympia Dukakis as Anna Madrigal was genius and I can't imagine anyone buy Laura Linney as Mary Ann.Tales of the City is one of my top 5 favorite books and the video totally captures it."
3,great set except for video quality,"Don't get me wrong: it's great to finally have this series available on DVD with some great extras thrown. But as a previous reviewer mentioned, the video quality is subpar -- very contrasy and the whites are too bright. Wish they could have done a better transfer than this.As for the content: if you've seen this series on PBS or Showtime or read the book, you know what a great story and set of characters we have here. I used to live in San Francisco, and Armistead Maupin really captured the City and character types so well. It actually makes me kind of homesick when I watch this series -- it's that good. The cast is outstanding all around, but Laura Linney really anchors this series. It's no suprise that she went on to do bigger projects."
5,wonderful,"This is storytelling at it's best. There are so many storylines that are tied in together. I was born in 78, so I couldn't say whether or not it was a realistic representation of the era and the place, but it seems fairly realistic. There are just so many interesting characters.Having said that, this isn'ta show for children. I love it and would certainly recommend it to otehrs"
5,The Greatest City Tale Ever,"What can I say about Tales of the City, no other story had made me truly care and worry about these characters. I myself live in San Francisco, I was a real life Mary Ann Singleton. What I truly love about Tales is how all these different character make you care about and want to go with them to their life process. I especially love Mrs. Madrigan, Olympia Dukakis is wonderful. Hopefully they will start doing the third installment with the original actors from the first. Olympia,Laura,Marcus, Chloe, William. Thank You Armistead Maupin."
1,Don't bother,"I suppose I should have known better picking up the 17th book in a series, but I needed something to read on a long flight - dreadful.It was my fault that I hadn't read any of the previous books so I didn't know the characters involved. But what I object to, is the poor grammer, poor spelling and formula storyline. It might have had some redeeming qualities if the story was even remotely believable.I don't know if it is up to Keith Douglass or the publishers to check, but there were so many typographical errors that someone did not do their job.I used my copy to start a fire while camping - the book was more valuable to me for it's flammable characteristics than its literary content."
5,PERFECT+ TRANSACTION,This was a great deal with GREAT! service. Perfect all the way through almost instant delivery.
2,Primarily of interest to archaeologists,"This poor-quality video explores the link between the ruins and artifacts discovered at Mycenae and Crete. The video consists primarily of pictures of the ruins of the palace complexes discovered in the two places, together with pictures of individual items.It is poorly structured in that it fails to follow any logical chronological or thematic sequence, and is thus confusing. Additionally, it appears to have been produced originally using the European (PAL) video format and then transferred to the American VHS format. As a result, the video portion is grainy and the audio is garbled."
5,Best Kitchen Utensils I've found!,"I've had this and several other of the Twin Cuisine Silicone utensils for about a year now. They hold their shape, clean up well, and look very nice.I like silicone for it's high level of heat resistance and also because it seems more sanitary.I inadvertently left the handle touching a rim of a hot pan for an extended time, and while it did blemish slightly, even the handle didn't burn - though I don't believe the handles are rated in the heat resistance factor.These are very easy to grip and the spatula tip is just soft enough to be a little flexible, but holds it's shape well and is sturdy enough to actually use for scraping. A lot of Silicone products I've found are too flimsy to be useful.I wish I could find more pieces than what I already have (spatulas, spoons, slotted spoon, soup ladle, the list goes on!). Not that I need them... I just like them that much!"
2,Don't care for this spatula,Too heavy - and due to rubberized handle does not slide easily into the kitchen tool cannister.
2,Poor Quality,"The zipper is only connected on one side of the case and there is no 'starting point' to begin the zip - both ends are sewn into the spine. The product will hold my pliers, but I'll have to use a rubberband or string to keep it closed. Not worth the price I paid."
5,best movie of all time. no contest,"Brilliant. Doomed Planet is a cinematic masterpiece in the strictest sense of the term. The richness of plot and tangibility of characters creates an overall mind blowing film experience.Set in Seattle, Wa during the turn of the millennium, the doomed planet cult and the cult of eternal consciousness fight for supremacy and survival. A wealth of philosophical knowledge unfolds throughout the film leading the viewer through a wandering introspective episode which, for me, culminated in the overarching truth: you're gonna die people, you might as well party.With extremely unlikely cameo appearances by Jerry Garcia and Mary-Kay Letourneau, you will ever be on the edge of your seat awaiting the next bombshell. An amazing grand finale type ending to this film is the cherry on top which makes it, in my book, the greatest film ever made. three thumbs up, five stars..."
4,Replacement ram,This stick installed with no problem. The computer started up and everything was back to normal. There have been no problems with it.
4,books,"I have read several of her books. She's a good writer. I admire her nonconformity/questioning/candor/spirit/honesty/empathy/intuitionand altruistic love for her family. There were troubles in their family. There are troubles in every family or so I've heard. There was justifiable questioning and normal rebellion. What family hasn't experienced this? She helped to eliminate the mystic of famous people being perfect for me. The books she writes are not just about her family, but they do encompass the members as a portrayal of idealogical norms at the time, some of which she did not agree with .She was/is very vocal/honest. I believe that she writes from her heart and the book, for her, was cathartic. She tried to deduce, through her writing, what the problem was and how to fix it. She wanted to help her family, while, at the same time show their true nature. I want to extend, as always, my highest regards and heartfelt condolences during their time of grief."
3,This is not trance...,"This is like Hard House. There's really nothing trancy about either CD at all... There is 0% build, 0% melody, 0% euphoria. However, it is a very powerful CD, and does have a catchy style. If you want to smash, and smash HARD, then these CD's will do it for you. It all sounds very similar, but that isn't necessarily all bad. And it never gets anywhere close to popish trance, so you're safe from that.If you're looking for more melodic trance, check out armin van buuren, old skool tiesto, and even paul oakenfold (minus bunkka)."
1,Weak,"This is was the last album for me, after I heard it Magic Mike and bass fell off my list (well he was the only one still doing it). The rap sucked and the beats only tracks were subpar. Back to my old stuff."
2,"Not Celtic, not Cowboy is right!","Bought Wilkie's other celtic album and was disappointed. Read the good reviews and thought I'd give his group another try, but once again was disappointed. I call it Mandolin Muzak. Just plays in the backround and is neither inspired nor memorable. Sorry for raining on the parade. I really tried to give this a fair try. If you like Irish music or cowboy music, you won't hear much of it here and you will probably not like this. If you like the guy (whose name escapes me at the moment) who drones on in that song about the Edmund Fitzgerald, you might like this stuff."
1,"""I Want my $10.00 back.""","I have never in my life commented on a book. This is my first time. I am not going to be critical of the author. Anyone who has the discipline to write fiction and get it published deserves credit for their accomplishment. My problem is how it was marked. It is clearly christian fiction, which is a good thing. I was not looking for christian fiction. I was looking for good old fashion science fiction. This is anything but that. I picked up the book over ten times. I skimmed it I tried to read the last chapter and it made no more sense than it did when I read the first. I am not ignorant and consider myself a well read person. If your looking for thrilling, thoughtful, compelling, gutsy science fiction pick up Heinlein or Asimov, not this. I would like amazon to refund my money or send me a $10.00 credit for a different book. Please move this to christian fiction where it belongs not in the science fiction genre."
1,Christian thrillers? Possible?,"I bought this book based on the suggestion from Amazon that I might like it because I had read The Sparrow. No two books could be more different. It has no characterization, no message beyond Christian simplistic idealism, and no plot. The ""characters"" are stereotypical manic religious people whose faith seems induced by some sort of ecstatic drug. Hey, there's a plot. The aliens are injecting our planet with religious zealotry. What will happen to our characters? Ah, suspense, their faith will be tested! But, will they lose it? Never. They will all cuddle up and pray happily ever after.Note to long time Sci-fi readers. Avoid this prosylitizing drivel."
5,These jeans are a men magnet!!!,I love these jeans! They are very flattering and make my legs look longer and my hips narrower! They really are a conversation starter and my men friends especially love the way they fit me. DO NOT HESITATE TO TRY A PAIR OF THESE JEANS!!!
5,Look No Further,"With the mighty Intruder's departure from carrier decks, the US Navy put itself out of the deep strike business. Therefore, the Morgan brothers' excellent treatment of the A-6 is doubly valuable, not only as a detailed history of the aircraft, but the 70-year legacy it represented in dedicated attack aviation. Therefore, anyone interested in the Grumman ""bomb truck"" need look no further for an authoritative, detailed account of one of the significant aircraft in naval aviation history."
2,It should be called the Sugar Bores,"My kids thought the CD was ""old fashioned"" as they put it. They listened to about half of side 1 and got very antsy. They said it sounded like music that Grandma and Grandpa like. I thought it was a cute record. A lot like the slick cover bands that we used to see in college. Just so so."
3,Growly,"I like Greg Brown when he's being wry and lyrical. This CD is gruffer, less melodic, less intimate and unfortunately, less appealing. Most of the songs are half-spoken instead of sung, and I just wished there were a couple of gentle tracks to break it up. If you like your folk music bluesy and growly with lots of words but not many tunes, this will be for you. It's not bad, but so not my favourite GB album."
3,Try this on for size:,"It's this simple...1) If you are unfamiliar with the works of Neil Young and want a decent sampling of his music and don't care about higher quality recordings, skip this package and just get the standard one disc release2) If you are unfamiliar with the works of Neil Young, want a decent sampling of his music and like higher quality sound recordings, get this package.3) If you are a fan of Neil's, it boils down to this--If you like higher quality sound in your CD music, get this version. If you could care less about the higher quality, skip it...unless you are totally fanatical and are willing to pay $20+ for two videos.That's about it in a nutshell."
1,Love Neil Young... but...,"Don't get me wrong... I love Neil Young... but, this CD is full of really low quality recordings. Not worth purchasing... promise."
1,What's The Point?,"This won't take long. Just a few simple questions: What's the point Neil? Are these songs great? No question about it, like a hundred more you have written. So what? Is the remastering good? Yeah. I guess. So? Do you need the money? No. Everybody knows that recording companies go for the money and nothing else, but I guess that's pretty obvious. But that's also not the case here. As far as I'm concerned, Neil himself did the deal in this case. A bad deal. A dirty one. Shame on you. PS: WE STILL LOVE YOU AND ALWAYS WILL. Do your fans an act of love: Put your whole catalog (or great part of it) in the hands of Rhino Records. They'll do the rest. PS: If I missed the point Neil, please forgive me."
4,sad news,"Well, this story REALLY touched my heart. Nov 21, at 11:00, I had to put my mare, Just A Rumor, to sleep. She had a severe case of colic, and ruptured an intestine. It was a real hard time for me, and this story really affected me. If there is anyone out there who has a special horse, READ THIS BOOK!! It has such a special meaning. But if you can't handle anymore stress, forget it. Its not worth it. But any ways... if anyone needs to email me ands talk about a horse or anything.. my email is just_a_rumor@hotmail.com"
3,"So, why do u hate Star?","Even though the review Im responding to was like 4-5 yeares ago. But still, it kinda needs to be fixed. We all know Star and Champion are both great horses and one of the best. I love them both. Just because Star wins all the time and sets track records doesnt mean its his falt. The colt loves to run and he has Wonders speed, heart, and a fire that can not be put out. I do like Champion more but that doesnt mean get rid of Star jsut because hes fast. He was Wonders last foal and Wonder didnt die so u can say u want her colt to disapear. Its almost like making it so that Secertariat and all those other grweat horses disapear. Champion and Star and 2 of the most greatest horses ever and that Star is spoiled. Just get to like the colt. And how can u like Precieous. I mean I would have liked her to if she where actaully exsisted. The only time I heard them mention Precieous was when she was born. So how can u love a horse that u hardly know about?"
3,Pretty Good,"This book was O.K. But It really scared me! I thought Wonder's Star would die! Please don't ever scare me like that again! I'm a big fan of Star's.But I'm glad that Christina chose racing. Look, eventing is cool but racing is better."
5,Down With Cindy!,"Personally, I love this series exept for Cindy. She's had contact with some of the best horses in the series but she is such a brat! I hate her! Ashleigh and Melanie are my faves, even though there aren't many books about Melanie. I like Christina too now that she races instead of eventing. Anyway, this is a REALLY good book. I cried so hard at the end when...well i'll let you red it. Its really good though!"
5,Why was cindy so snobby?,"This was one great book. I can't believe how snobby Cindy was though. I mean jeez. I feel sorry for Christina and for Star. I also can't believe how Lavinia treated Parker. I mean who would say ""no no you touched the horse your filthy"" to thier own son? That is just plain rude! If anyone agrees with me please email me. BrandiP15@excite.com, or racinggirl2007@hotmail.com(or you can email me for fun I don't really care)well thanks for reading my review. Oh and if you haven't read the book I hope you enjoy it when you do."
4,If you are looking for a spiritual quote...,"This book has been extremely helpful to me in my search for the profound sprititual quotes. The list goes on from Socrates to Papa Ramdas. From Christian to Sufi to Hindu to Buddhist - no one is left out. From the ancient to the modern thinker, guru, guide and teacher. Some of the quotes come from people I've never heard of. Who are these people?? The quotes are listed in categories such as Cause/Effect, Mind, Meditation, Love, etc."
2,"Huge effort, and yet weak in content","I sincerely appreciate this authors effort to compile such an extensive collection of quotes. Personally, I did not find that it fulfilled the implication of the title. Sometimes quantity of words does not mean quality of information. Maybe others will find more in this book than I did."
3,Standard Deviants Devils etc,I bought this movie to teach concepts of monsters for my English 12 class before we read Beowulf.
5,Just what I expected,The item was delivered quickly and in excellent condition. The product worked perfectly and was a great price. I would definitely refer this seller to a friend and would certainly buy from them again.
4,ka-bar,"I have used this knife to cut many different things. It is durable and well built. The blade is thick, which is good, but it does not fit in our electric diamond knife sharpener. It would be nice if the grip was a bit longer. Overall, I think that this knife is a good investment."
4,Most complete set of early recordings,"With so many budget albums out there that have the early recordings of The Bee Gees in various combinations, it seemed difficult to get them all without having to many duplicates.This double album makes it easy. Not all songs are all that great, but you can certainly follow the development of the typical early Bee Gees sound. I also like the cover versions of Lennon & McCartney songs they do on this album.So if you want the very early stuff, buy this one - you won't need any other then."
5,History... And It's Interesting Too!,"Utah Phillips is the perfect CD. A singer of occasional talent, a poet of considerable talent, and the best damn storyteller I've ever heard, this is a particularly nice album in that it has a really good musician doing backup music, which makes it much more interesting at times. The stories on this are often amusing, often touching, and always fascinating. The songs are good too. So are the poems. Go buy it. Now."
2,Bad Sound,"This phone worked fine for the first week or so, but after that the sound quality got really bad. There's just a lot of static and feedback. I tried everything the owner's manual suggested to fix it, but nothing helped. I can't understand what the person on the other end is saying. I'll be returning this phone."
2,"Mediocre Phone, but okay for the price","This phone is nothing spectacular. All in all, everything works as advertised. I have, however, a few reservations:-The handset microphone is WAY too quiet. I always have people asking me to speak up. The phone is designed flat, so to move the mouthpiece closer to your mouth means moving the earpiece farther from your ear. Not a great solution, obviously.-The volume control on the answering machine is set too high. The lowest volume is still too high, and the highest is ridiculously high (unless you're in a manufacturing environment).-The ringer control on the phone is set too high. The low volume is still to loud and the high volume is way too loud.-No speakerphone, which is no fun when you are on the phone with a customer service (cable/phone/credit card/etc.)."
3,works fine- low handset volume,I bought this rom amazon. It arrived promptly and set up is easy. Works fine except the volume in handset is low. Even turning to max you just barely hear at times.
3,Works well but poor sound quality,"This phone works fine -- all the functions, etc. The only problem is that the receiver is very, very quiet. Even when punched up to maximum volume you can barely hear the person on the other end of the line."
2,Can't hear you!,No one can ever hear me on this phone and my mom has the same phone and I can never hear her. Terrible phone.
2,Doesn't do what we need it to do,"The range sucks, and the handset is designed so that I hit the ""end"" button with my ear all the time if I hold it in my right hand (I, like most, am right-handed), so I hang up on people. Had I known either of these things, I wouldn't have bought this phone."
1,Horrible experience,I purchased this phone a while back and I have had such a bad experience with it. I can't go 15 ft without massive static. I wish I had purchased another phone.
3,Scarafice of quality...you get what you pay for,I bought this ring in the store with a very good color (F) I could see a visible white inclution in the store but only when I looked from the side. I even went out into the mall to look at outside store light. When I got outside there were two huge inclutions in the center stone even visable from a distance and a black inclution in a side stone. SO bottom line...you get what you pay for. Also I saw other rings in the store the same style and price but were L-M color.
4,American By Choice,An excellent reading. Captain Fuentes does an excellent job in his account of his experiences of September 11. The end of the book is particularly interesting.
5,Authentic Tribute to Bob Monroe,"I have had the opportunity to read this book, interview Rosalind and also work with Bob Monroe. This book is a heartfelt tribute to Bob and an intimate revelation of Rosalind's personal experiences. These expereinces occured when there was little information and research available to contextualize them. In other words, it was a time when everyone was out beyond the edge of what was known and pyschologically survivable. Rosalind demonstrated great courage in exploring this ""new"" technology, her inner self and her perceptions of uncharted realms of consciousness. Rosalind is the real deal."
2,New age blah blah,"I started reading this book and must admit that the first chapter was OK. Suddenly the OBE traveling starts and it ends in reviewing all new age cliches that exist around the world.Reading some other books on OBE's I can't resist to mention William Buhlman's book. In his books he describes that OBE's are heavilly influenced by our own thought patterns. Here you go, you see what you want to see. No wonder there's allot of same type experiences between her and Robert Monroe. They've been talking allot with each other. Don't believe that what is written is the absolute truth about OBE's and other intellingences throughout space. It's all about yourself and how you stand in the world."
1,A book to forget,"I agree totally with another reviewer in that I am practicing fast reading with this book, to get rid of it as soon as possible.I have read Robert Monroe's books, which I appreciate much, and expected this one to be of similar quality, but it is not; it is full of new-age tales, giving a view of the ""there"" far different than the clear and unspoiled view I found at Monroe's Books.A very bad buy, considering that is is quite expensive too, don't buy unless you are sure that it is what you expected."
1,How can this be true?,"I have been reading and enjoying the works of the late Robert A. Monroe for many years. Rosalind McKnight's accounts of the features and experiences in the etheric plane are consistent with other accounts. However, I was 150 pages into this book and all of a sudden it occurred to me - how can any of this possibly be true? How is it possible to be astrally projected out of one's physical body and still be hearing questions from the control room in the lab and still be verbally answering questions with one's physical mouth while one is in another dimension? Sounds funny to me. I would find it more credible if the author wrote down recollections of her experiences after she had returned to the physical plane. As far as I'm concerned, You can't be two places at once."
5,cosmic journeys above and beyond time space realities.....,"This is the most advanced, experiential and knowledgeable account of actual experiences documented and interpreted by Rosalind Mcknight. As we all know shifting consciousness, altered states of awareness and travel into other realities are not easy to transcribe or explain in a linear form. I love this book for the confirmations it gave me and the sharing of many journeys and highly recommend it for the adventerous spirit and strong of heart. Robert was indeed a pioneer of the many planes of reality"
3,"Good workout, but.....","I'd like to say that I liked this workout routine. But....I have to say the sound quality is very poor. The instructor has a beautiful, soft voice. Unfortunately, there are parts of the video that it is very hard to hear what she is saying. I found myself really distracted by the poor sound quality."
5,My favorite yoga vid,"I love this workout! I don't consider it a beginner tape. I've tried yoga tapes that attempt to incorporate weighted bars, & have never been pleased with the ""feel"" of it. The resitance band really works with the yoga postures. The instructor cues mirror-image, which I really appreciate, with voice-over. No annoying chatter or tiresome banter. The background music is new-agey and very soothing. The instructor's very pleasant speaking voice makes the relaxation sequence a real treat."
3,Aliens??!,"Interesting twists and turns await you here. Come on in.(As long as you can ignore a couple wth short moments. :)(I was able to figure out most of the twists beforehand, but I still like to read it. And it has ShadowCat! Go Kitty! And her dragon, which I can't for the life of me remember his name at the moment! Argh! I'll remember as soon as I post this, just you bet. lol)"
2,"Good Charactorizations, So-So Plot","The author hits the charactorizations spot on, and picks most of the best X-men to include in this book, but the plot is not equal to the charactors. Could have used more action."
5,Very large Griddle,Was very glad to see how large it was. It makes it easy to cook your whole breakfast to dinner in one spot. Very nice to grill veggies to. So glad I purchased the Presto griddle. What a breeze to clean.
4,Nothing Like It,"Searched everywhere here at home in Canada and on line, looking for a decent griddle. Local stores had nothing big enough, nothing rated as well and nothing for near the price. This griddle had everything. I ordered it, picked it up across the border for a total of $34 plus $12 worth of gas. I seasoned the griddle and made a huge batch of pancakes the same day just to see if the grill maintained the heat as others said it did. It did. You have to let it preheat, just like an oven or a regular frying pan, and it will cook 6 large pancakes or 9 5"" ones, with room for a couple of eggs. I use it a lot and like it more each time. I cooked a huge batch of marinated chicken thighs all at once, and the temperature dropped quite a bit. It did not recover until the meat was cooked, but it was not a failure. This griddle will not handle huge heat sink loads, but it is bigger and easier to use than anything else I have seen before or since."
2,Uneven cooking,"This is fast, easy and inexpensive but the problem is that it cooks unevently so you end up haveing to over compensate on sum, over cook part, and have part just right. You can not beat the price though if you are on a low budget."
4,Big Griddle!,"We had a tiny griddle - if you made tiny pancakes, it would hold 8. So breakfast always required one person to stay in the kitchen making pancakes while everyone else ate. It felt wrong. So we got the big one, and it did indeed solve our problem. My only gripe is that the griddle (still only a month old) does off-gas a toxic smell. Probably the non-stick coating. I put it outdoors on High (400 degrees) for an hour before we used it indoors. I guess this is true of all new non-stick items."
2,Cooks pancakes unevenly,"Though this BigGriddle is a simple design, it cooks pancakes unevenly. This is because the heating coil wraps around underneath the thin aluminum griddle just one circumference for such a large surface area. Pancakes cook unevenly, ending up looking light and dark on both sides.Also, the power cord is very short.Presto really skimped on the design and materials to maximize profit motive. What else is new...Save your money. You'll see these at garage sales soon."
4,Quality Product,This Presto Griddle has met or exceeded all expectations. It is replacing an older smaller model by the same company. That one has held up well but after 6 year is showing its age. This upgrade seems to have been a very wise choice. If you need a Griddle this product should reasonably be considered.
4,Received as a gift - Giving as a gift,"I received this griddle as a wedding gift and I use it all the time. I love it so much that I bought it for my sister as a holiday gift. When I'm making pancakes, by the time I have the griddle full it's time to go back to the beginning and flip already! I love the adjustable temperature. I've used the grease trap many times with bacon. The griddle tilts so slightly (in a good way) that it's enough for the bacon grease to drip and it won't make your pancake batter drip if you're cooking them at the same time. Highly recommend."
5,This is a big griddle as advertised....GREAT for families!,This is a big griddle. Exactly what we wanted. Bought this for my wife for Christmas. Christmas morning she said I really need a griddle for the house. How funny! She opened one up that night. This griddle is great! The only complaint would be there are some hot or cold spots. Probably due to the size of the griddle. The heating element only covers so much area underneath. I don't remember this issue with the smaller (thinner) Presto griddles. I have three of them. The smaller ones are in the camper. I would buy this again.
5,Outstanding,"Outstanding! Haven't had any issues with uneven heating... So nice to be able to do a families worth of food at once, all the right temp without having to worry about keeping things warm/drying out. Only drawback is that it is hard to fit in sink/ dishwasher....but that is really minor...super easy to clean."
4,Great Product!,"I really enjoy my new BigGriddle! It is such a time saver as you can cook a whole pound of bacon at one time and it turns out perfectly! I love the ""tilt"" feature that drains excess grease off the top of the griddle as you are cooking.Please be sure that you ample cupboard space to store it...this thing is BIG! Mine fits perfectly in the bottom drawer of my stove.I would rate this product a five star with one exception. While the ""tilt and drain"" is a great feature, the design is faulty and the cooking surface wants to ""drop"" to the ""tilt"" position all the time. This makes it difficult to fry eggs and pancakes and maintain a level surface. I have to block the front legs on each side to keep it in the upright position.Other than that, I love it and would buy it again!"
5,AWESOME,"IF YOU LIKE TO EAT A BIG BREAKFAST THIS IS A MUST. WE ARE A FOUR PERSON FAMILY, TWO TEEN BOYS ,MY SELF AND MOMMA. WHEN WE EAT A BREAKFAST WE USUALLY USE 12 EEGS, FULL PACK OF BACON OR SAUSAGES AND 12 PANCAKES. BEFOR PURCHASE WE NEEDED ONE NORMAL GRIDDLE AND TWO FRYING PANS! NOW THE BIG GRIDDLE AND ONE PAN DOES THE JOB. HIGHLY RECOMMEND."
5,Great griddle,Perfect for those mornings when the entire family is here. Can put out eggs & pancakes so quickly. love it!
5,Good value,I bought this cause it was highly rated. Some people complained it didn't heat evenly. I preheat while I mix up my pancake batter so like 10 min and have had no issues making up to plate sized pancakes. Great value and I can now fix a quadruple batch faster than the old single batch
5,This is a great griddle.,"I give this a five star because it is a great griddle. If you need a large surface griddle, this is the one. The Tilt 'n Drain feature works fine. My husband uses the griddle and loves it."
1,Does not get hot,"This product fails at its one and only task -- getting hot. After plugging in the griddle and preheating it to 400 degrees for ten minutes I was looking forward to making a stack of pancakes. The griddle was barely hot enough to set the batter, despite the pilot indicating it was at temp. I then sprinkled cold water on the griddle to do the ""skitter"" test. Not only did the unit fail to make the water sizzle -- it did not make the water evaporate. What a piece of junk."
5,Presto Tilt and Drain Big Griddle,I had a smaller presto griddle before. I love it except it was too small to fix all my breakfast at once. That is why I wanted the Big Griddle. I can now cook all of my breakfast at once !!! I love this !!!!! The griddle is larger than I expected or wanted ; however I am only a family of 2. Anyone that has more people in the family would love it !!! I got the best price from Amazon !!! I find this to be true almost all of the time !!! I shop amazon frequently !!!!! I hope this is of help to someone !!!! Thanks and God Bless You !!!! I am not sure yet how exactly the tilt and drain feature works yet ? I ordered this same griddle back in November from another vendor and I still didn't have it a month later or longer !!! I cancelled the order with the other vendor which had the price a few pennies cheaper than amazon at the time. I then ordered from my trusty amazon vendor and got it withing a week of date of purchase I believe !!!!!Kathy Castleberry
5,awesome griddle,"best griddle ever!!! Large even cooking area. Easy to clean. We use it for everything, bacon & eggs, burgers, grilled cheese, Pancakes,french toast. would highly recommend to anyone"
2,Slip n slide,"This griddle is big and it will cook a pound of bacon at once or 6 huge pancakes. That's the good. However, it does not heat evenly and you do have to keep moving the food around and checking it often. My major complaint is that the handles are not stable and will continually fall out from under the appliance. There is no way to lock these handles into position. Just a simple matter of flipping pancakes will cause the griddle to slide into drain mode. My next purchase will definitely not be this one. Also, as one other reviewer noted, the drain tray does have a tendency to fall out from time to time, and this is a potential hazard."
1,When going Big is Bad...,Take it from this Saturday morning pancake making dad...avoid this griddle. It is simply too large and large in a clumsy way and not a helpful way. I can maybe get 1 more pancake on there than the regular rectangular model. The element is basically the same from the smaller model and works way too hard to compensate for the increased area leaving colder zones. The increased area doesn't equal useful cooking area. Go for the smaller rectangular model and save yourself the headaches. Especially hard to wash the larger square shape where the rectangle was much easier.
4,When there's company for breakfast this griddle rocks,"This griddle is huge, has great heat distribution and it's so much fun to set up and use. I can do a pound of bacon at a time and it cooks better on here than anywhere else.I can scramble a dozen eggs at a time for company and cook half a recipe of pancakes at one go. The size and even heat are huge pluses. I gave it to our daughter and son in law as a gift.The drain cup goes into the dishwasher and the griddle cleans up beautifully since the surface is nonstick.It can be tilted slightly for draining and when the tilting ""arms"" are moved they don't always stay perfectly in place. That's my only issue with it.For the size, price and convenient and for the even cooking and great performance this griddle has been a terrific addition to my kitchen. It's a real weekend warrior."
2,uneven heating and tough to fit in cupboard,"The heating coil that runs around under the skillet allows for very uneven heating. The pancake batter that was poured in the middle took 2x as long to cook as the others. The pancakes around the edges were cooked more brown on the half closest to the heat coil. It did heat up quickly and the non-stick surface was great, even for our oatmeal pancakes.Cleanup was pretty easy, but the pan is so long and awkward in the sink I made a mess with the water and soap.The size of the pan is huge and I had a difficult time fitting it in the lower cupboards but you can make a TON of pancakes or grilled cheese sandwiches at one time.Returning this one to the store and looking for a better option."
5,Great Griddle,"This griddle is great. It heats the pancakes easily and most importantly, I am able to make more that 2 pancakes at a time, so my whole family can sit down to breakfast together. I have made 6 large pancakes and still had room on the griddle for more batter if I wanted it. You can see he lines from the heating element on the pancakes, but it does not affect the taste of the pancakes, just the look. You also have to adjust the temp to your tatses. If you like your pancakes darker, you need to use the higher setting suggested. I did notice though that when I turned on the griddle to heat up, but did not cook the pancakes as soon as it was ready, the pancakes seemed darker (not quite burnt) and cooked too fast. Subsequent batches of pancakes come out as good as the first batch."
5,Awesome HUGE griddle,"This is a HUGE griddle! It takes up my entire stove surface, when I get it out to cook! Exactly what I was looking for!If you don't have lots of storage space... you might want something a little smaller.Grill is VERY easy to use & clean! I just love it!Finally ~ we can all sit down to pancakes TOGETHER on a weekend morning!Love this griddle & recommend it if you are looking for a huge griddle!"
5,Bigger is Better,"This is my 3rd Presto Griddle, but 1st Tilt'n Drain Big. If you can't decide which to buy, go with this one. For the price difference you'd be nuts not to. Between deer hunting, pheasant hunting and fishing in Canada, I spend about 30 days a year cooking for at least 10 people a day plus cooking at home. It makes a difference. Heats up quickly and holds heat consistantly."
2,Disappointing Performance and Durability,"Within the first few weeks of owning this griddle, it was clear that it wasn't going to last the 10 years we used our previous one. The handles are very fragile, both have broken and needed to be epoxied back together. Additionally, there is a rather large cool spot in the middle of the cooking surface because the heating element gores around the perimeter of the cooking surface. Unfortunately, after five months we are in the market for a replacement."
5,Best item I have ever bought for my kitchen...,"Hands down best kitchen gadget I own. You can cook an entire package of bacon at one time and fry eggs simultaneously! The pan (with handles pulled out) drains perfectly into grease collector. With handles in, it is a level surface for pancakes etc. It is large-takes up a shelf in my cabinet but it is worth it. Love this thing."
4,Good Value,"Presto 07046 Tilt 'n Drain Big Griddle Cool-Touch Electric GriddleI purchased this griddle sight unseen for use in church kitchen. The cooking surface is large. Even though we let the griddle preheat as other reviewers suggested, we found that there are still hot and not-so-hot spots on the cooking surface of the griddle which yielded pancakes that were not uniform in color. Despite that shortcoming, it was adequate for our purposes. At $36 it was a very good value. We are considering buying a second one."
4,Decent family sized Griddle,"I was looking for a griddle so that I could cook several pancakes at the same time instead of just one in skillet. It's a nice griddle - easy to clean and you can get about 6 good sized pancakes going at the same time. I'd like it to cook a little more evenly then it does, but I've only used it once so maybe I'll figure out how to get that to happen with use."
2,Uneven heating kills it,"The Presto grill fails in the most critical area, even cooking. It is easy to clean, has a clever system for draining, and has a large cooking surface. However, these attributes are secondary benefits for griddles. It first has to cook right and this Presto does not. We returned it."
2,Cooks unevenly,"Nice large size, but it cooks pancakes unevenly. The ""cakes"" in the center (not near the heating element) are undercooked while those directly over the element can get too brown/dark.The cooking surface is very thin, which probably contributes to the uneven cooking. May work for bacon and other foods that are not as sensitive to browning as pancakes."
5,Love this griddle,"Large cooking surface, nice edge to control spilling and tilt to run of cooking grease. Really a pleasure to cook on the griddle. The square form is much easier to use that my old rectangle grill."
4,Our 2nd one !,"This is our second one. Our first one of these always worked great -- only reason for replacing is because I dropped it from a high shelf and broke some of the plastic parts! Nice, large griddle works great for bacon, pancakes. . ."
5,"Yes, I'm lazy","I'll have to admit my early morning laziness when reviewing this product. I get up, throw my bacon on the griddle for a couple minutes, rub the grease around to lightly grease it and scrape the excess into the grease trap. Then I throw the eggs on and place the bread on the side so I don't have to find the toaster. Yes, I use one griddle to cook my bacon/sausage, eggs, and toast all at the same time. Then I stack the entire sandwich right there and let the freshly added piece of cheese melt. And the clean up is as simple as scraping it with my spatula while it's hot and wiping it with a sponge once it's cooled off. As to the comments about how it took up too much space, well I've almost completely stopped using my stove since I bought this a couple years ago, so I just set it right there (I have a small kitchen too) and I move it to occasionally cook anything that actually requires a pot or pan. Yes, this is the lazy bachelor way of doing things, but it's my way!"
4,Perfect Griddle,"My wife has been wanting an electric griddle for a while. I did some searching and found that though on the low end, it had great reviews. I decided to give it a try and was I ever happy. Both my wife and I have used it and it is great for doing pancakes and getting enough done so that more than one person can eat at a time. I did scrambled eggs and French toast. I almost felt like a real short-order cook. I highly recommend this if you're looking for size and convenience."
5,Huge cooking surface,I looked for a replacement griddle for at least 6 months before I found this griddle. I wanted a griddle large enough to be able to cook a full meal of quesadillas without having to put the first batch in the oven to keep warm. This griddle is large enough to be able to go from the griddle to the table. If you are looking for a large cooking surface this is the griddle for you! It was just what I was looking for.
4,Pancake heaven,"I couldn't wait to make multiple pancakes, I wasn't disapointed. Nice even heat and hot temperature reached quickly. I get about 9 pancakes at one time. Tasted so good and so fluffy."
4,Great size and temp controls,This is a great size for large families. I use it as a hot plate to keep food hot during meals. It accommodates several pots/dishes and the temperature controls means I can control just how hot it gets. It's great!
4,Good Grill,"This grill works great for my family of five. My only complaint is that the back and side stops are too low. If you are overzealous in pushing your spatula under the food you are trying to flip you could end up with food on your countertop. I would also like higher back and side stops for cracking my eggs. Overall, I am well pleased and would buy it again when this unit wears out."
4,Nice griddle,"As you'd expect from Presto, this is a nice griddle. Works well, heats quickly, cooks evenly, great nonstick surface (no spray needed for pancakes!). Legs pivot outwards to tilt the griddle towards the drain, so bacon drains nicely without looking for something to prop the rear legs up. But the best part is the size- its about 1.5x size of a standard griddle- so rather than 2 rows of p-cakes, I can do three. Faster cooking means batches are done quicker, and you're not left with a plate of cold pancakes by the time the last batch is cooked, and the cook is not constantly getting up from the breffast table to flip the next batch. Highly recommended."
2,"Fantastic concept, but quality makes the griddle fall short","I bought this griddle in September 2011. It worked well enough for me until it broke.Pros:*The tilting option is great because it allows you to easily drain for greasy items, and then being able to level it out for items like pancakes where you need a level surface.*The extra room means less batches and less cook-time.Cons:*Uneven cooking surface means you have to watch things closely and move stuff around*Extra large size makes cleaning a pain*the same mechanism that allows the griddle to tilt is cheap plastic and it broke after 8 months of moderate use. I was able to superglue it back together however."
4,HUGE griddle - great so far,"Make sure you are aware of just how big this griddle is before you order it. I wanted a large griddle so I didn't really get back the word big in the description. This thing is huge!!! I like it and it works great, but I had to move it around in the kitchen a lot to finally find a spot where I could safely use it."
2,"yes it's big, but its also flawed","I have always loved presto griddles, so I was excited to get this one, but it became obvious son after that the heating element needed to be lengthened so it heats more of the surface area. There are massive cold spots on this unit that makes it worthless."
5,fantastic griddle,"I bought this griddle based on the reviews I read here and I was not sorry! Just as other reviewers said, the heat is even and the griddle cleans up like a dream!I received a Black and Decker non-stick griddle for my birthday (I know, but I like to get kitchen stuff so there) and I've never been happy with it. The heat was uneven and it got ""gunk"" on it I could not remove. The Presto was a totally different story! LOVE it!Plus the size of this thing is awesome!"
5,Presto Big Griddle,"I wanted a grill that was big enough to cook several things at once,easy to clean,and easy to use. I found it in the Big Grill. I love this grill. It's so versitile. Also am delighted with the tilt handles and the drain pan.There is nothing on the market like it. I truly recommend this product to everyone.Gloria Zimmerman"
5,What's not to like?,"This griddle is the biggest I could find, and it makes six 6-inch pancakes at once with no crowding, and no oil needed. It heats evenly and accurately. I'm very happy with it, especially for the price."
5,Presto 07046 big griddle,It is huge...I love it so much I bought two. One for the house and one for the camper. Great product for a big family. Gets the job done fast. Highly recommend.
5,would recommended this griddle,"I was looking for an electric griddle that would be larger than normal.I find this griddle to be perfect for my large family.It works great.The griddle sides pull out to drain the oil great idea fast warm up and non stickgreat choice you can,t go wrong with the quality and price."
5,Griddle is amazing. I'm so glad I bought them...,"When I first got married, we received a griddle for a wedding present. We ended up never using it, and it eventually was given away.I was in-charge of cooking pancakes and sausage for a group of about 150-200 at a church 4th of July pancake breakfast. I knew I needed some griddles, and they needed to be large.PROS:1. It heats up evenly, so the pancakes cook perfectly. They also look perfect.2. You can tilt the unit so when making sausage, the grease drains into a drain pan.3. The size is perfect. Having a large cooking surface is fantastic.4. My wife who things griddles are a waste of money, loved cooking on this and is happy with the purchase. (Should be first on the list.)We have since used this for cooking chicken, quesadillas, bacon, grilled cheese, etc.Oh, and it cleans easily."
4,So Far So Good,Have made Huckleberry pancakes twice. Both times they came out great. They cooked evenly on all areas of the griddle. Cleaned up very easy too.
2,fog greaser,"This grill is truly meant for outdoor use mainly, I cooked bacon and burgers and fog and grease were all over everything. your best bet is for breakfast only light foods like eggs and hasbrown work best. I am very disappointed, this grill burns in the worst way dont buy."
2,Uneven heating and lost non-stick property,"We just threw away this griddle after using it about 3 years. The fact it lasted three years may mean I should rate it higher, but throughout that time it heated unevenly and gradually lost its non-stick property. Cooking spray became a requirement for use, and it takes a lot of spray to cover the surface of this thing. Like other reviewers note, pancakes cook quicker around the edges than in the middle. Going to try a different brand, I wonder if I'll continue pouring the batter for the middle pancake first..."
5,Great griddle,"This griddle is great. It shipped fast, great size, I would definitely recommend this product.Exactly what I was looking for"
2,very disappointed,"Doesn't cook as evenly as I would like, the cord is to short .I still use it only because Its there. should have contacted Presto . I still might?"
5,Perfect for a family of four,"I purchased this griddle because the electric frypan we had was simply too small. While trying to flip a few pancakes in it, half of it didn't stay in!! The first thing I cooked with this griddle was therefore pancakes. Instead of the 4 batches it used to take, I did it in 1. Flipping the pancakes was mess-free and effortless with the nonstick surface. I have since tried eggs and also bacon. I love the tilt function with the grease trap. It definitely helps keep splattering down. The one thing you will need is space to use it as well as store it. I set it on our stovetop while in use, which works for me.Highly Recommend this product."
2,"Cooks unevenly, cold spots","Had older Presto griddle, the narrower but longer kind, has always worked extremely well for us. Bought this one for the larger size cooking area but discovered as many others have noted here, it definitely had cold spots so we returned it.For what it's worth, I invest a lot of stock in what Amazon users say, which is one huge reason I bought this, at the time 4.5 stars out of 60+ reviews. Not sure if that's because me and a handful of others got bad ones, or if the other folks just didn't notice it based on what they're cooking, or were blinded by its positive aspects, for if you can get past the cold spots (which I have a hard time believing anyone could), based on size, looks, and the cool little tilt feature, this one's really nice. Oh well, hope this helps some folks make a decision."
5,Wow what a griddle,I am very impressed with the size of this griddle. When I went to toast hamburger buns I was able to get 8 buns (both top and bottom) on the giddle at the same time. Nice to finally be able to sit down and eat with the family. It heats up fast and stays hot. My last griddle would cook the first round of pancakes great but the next rounds would take longer and longer to cook because the griddle would cool down. Not this one! It cooks all of them quickly and evenly!
5,Stove top replacement - Its Huge!,"This is a good deal on a very large electric fry pan. With our growing family it is nice to cook everything at once. Every Sunday morning, I make about 20-24 heart healthy pancakes for my family to eat on during the week. It used to take about 45-60 minutes to cook all of them. With this ""Big Griddle"", I've cut my cooking time down to about 15-20 minutes. More time for eating..and for the family. Our only problem has been where to store it."
2,Doesn't cook evenly,"My pancakes on the back where dark brown, the ones in front light brown, while the one in the center wasn't even light brown."
3,Spoiled Christmas Griddle Gift,"I have no idea how good this griddle is. I do know it was not shipped in a box, it just had a label slapped on the griddle box. The person I was going to give it to as a gift saw it. Thanks a lot, Amazon! DUH!!!!CHRISTMAS = GIFTS = SURPRISES (surprises are the general nature Christmas gifts)I would think any item bought the week before Christmas MIGHT BE a gift and it MIGHT BE appropriate to disguise it in...a brown box, no?!?! (shaking my head...)"
1,Easy Breaker,"I bumped in to the doorway going into the kitchen and the handle broke off, not made to last. Why do manufactures keep using cheep plastic for legs and handles?"
1,Cool griddle - well actually cold,"Maybe it was the one we received - an outlier. It takes forever to get hot, does not get as hot as we'd like, and after 4 months broke. But hey it was cheap... :-("
3,Not that good,"This griddle is not completely bad, but it does have one major flaw. The heating element forms a ring around the underside of the griddle, which leaves a large area in the middle of it that does not heat up as much as the rest of the griddle. If I cook pancakes the one that is in the middle takes almost twice as long to cook. The good points are that it is a very large griddle and it heats up very quickly (just unevenly)."
4,Solid Griddle,"It says it in the name, this is a big griddle. You can fit a whole lot of bacon on here, that's for sure. The grease trap on this works very well, just use the tilting function and most of the grease runs right off. The heating is a little uneven, which is to be expected with the heating coil design that was used. The center is a little cooler than the edges, but not enough to throw off cooking too much. My fist time using it i was making egg sandwiches and didn't use any cooking spray since they claimed it was non-stick. Unfortunately they were wrong, though it's better than some griddles, I still use spray with it every time. It's a good griddle, and you get what you pay for, don't expect a professional griddle."
2,"Pretty to look at, no substance","McNair has a ""cookie cutter"" approach to his cookbooks, laughing all the way to the bank. No love, and little care, went into this one. The recipes do not generate the appearance or flavor promised in the descriptions, and have to be tinkered with. In some cases, you wonder if the author actually worked with the recipes. Expensive ingredients are specified, such as imported cheeses, which add little or nothing to the dish. This feels like a book done to pay the mortgage. Save your money for your own mortgage-- don't buy this book."
2,Skynrd Movie,"I bought the DVD because some reviews said that the Oakland show was on it.The Oakland Skynrd show is great,however it is not part of this DVD."
2,Excellent Band - Horrible Movie,"As someone mentioned, if you can't go see the live band, watch this (Freebird - the movie).I'm sorry, but don't even waste your time watching this thing. I definitely got the impression there was no organization at all when filming this concert. To many times the camera's are just wandering around, not on anything at all actually.In the grand finale of ""Freebird"", you know when the band kicks in and there is some great guitar playing, for some reason the next few minutes are on the audiance. WTF. Some shots are from in the crowd looking at the band, BUT, you can't see the band. You see the back of some chick sitting on the shoulders of some guy. Again, WTF.Sometimes there are good shots of the band playing, but for the most part, they are horribly framed.Bad, bad movie.If you have the patience, they have just recorded another concert (July 2003) for a upcoming DVD. Anything has to be better than this."
5,Freebird: The Movie,"If you love Lynyrd Skynyrd, and even if you don't, this video is fantastic. It documents the lives of the band before the tragic plane crash and has a great tribute section in the end to those who are gone."
5,The Best Skynyrd Video,"FREEBIRD: THE MOVIE is the best Lynyrd Skynyrd video ever, because it's the only one to feature the original band. It intersperses the music from the soundtrack album, which I own and love, with interviews, on-plane footage, and several songs not on the soundtrack CD/cassette. Among the exceptional music here are the only recorded live versions of ""What's Your Name"" and ""That Smell"" by the Ronnie-fronted Skynyrd. This video is a must-own for any rock & roll fan."
3,MUMMA ALWAYS SAID LIFE WAS LIKE A BOX OF CHOCKLATTS,"YOU NEVER KNOW WHAT YOO GONNA GET!!!!!!Yes boys,Mr. Young is putting you down again._____________________________________________________________A 1 trick pony, written clearly when they were pissed off at Neil Young about some of his lyrics.Perhaps someone should have pissed them off more often then they might have had more hits. That is if the good ole boys could remember to fill up the gas (!!!).If it wasn't for the movie `Almost Famous' I would never have known they had a 2nd good song ""Simple kind of man"".So that puts them up there alongside with KISS.I thought this was going to be a goldmine like `The Allman Brothers Band'.But unfortunately,ABSOLUTELY NOT (!!!).Two stars, 1 for each song.However I do recognize that these are very special people.And special people should always be encouraged!!!So 1 star extra for being so special................................."
5,Opinion of Freebird the Movie / Tribute Tour,"I've been waiting for this moment of Freebird the Movie & Lynyrd Skynyrd's Tribute Tour to be released onto DVD, and both of these films on one DVD go real well with one another, because It tells an excellent story from when Ronnie Van Zant sung in the group, and after his untimely death up til his youngest brother Johnny became the lead singer to carry on the spirit of Lynyrd Skynyrd. We'll never forget you Ronnie,Allen,Steve,Cassie & Leon!!!!"
3,Disappointing Video and Audio Quality,"While the music itself of Lynyrd Skynyrd is among my favorite's of all time, the quality of the production on this DVD is really low rate. Almost all of the video samples on Freebird are fairly poor, and the audio at times is not much better.Also, the menu design on this dvd is HORRIBLE. Very difficult to navigate. Overall, the dvd's are priced low as they should be. Unbelievable performances by Skynyrd, you can't argue with excellence.. but do not expect top notch production quality on this dvd."
5,great documentary,very good quality. great documentary. what an excellent band and a very sad ending to a group that was so beloved. tragic
3,Too small for big price,"It's my own fault, I know, I didn't read the description well enough. But I thought for that price, I was getting the amount of storage space shown in the photo. Just FYI, that price is for ONE section of 3x3 bins. It's great - good quality, heavy, not hard to put together, looks nice...but for that price???? You could get more storage space for less, most definitely."
3,Just okay - but SMALL,"I should have reviewed the measurements! This cubby looks like it should be waist height, but is is about as tall as my knee. each box will fit a pair of sneakers... or 2 pair of kids shoes (which is what I am using it for NOW that I see how big it is)This is my fault for not checking the specs."
5,"Like Deep Forest, Mythos, or Oceania you'll enjoy this!","So what if you don't understand the language, sit back and listen to the mix of native songs with modern backup and the writer's narrative. You'll find yourself pulled into the telling of story. Find yourself on the shore, walking the forest, or soaring in the heavens. If you like Native American or first nation music this is a got to have CD. Salaw and Generation Hand Down are my favorite tracks."
2,This isn't EW&F CD!,"This album is not EW&F.;It's ""The AlMckay Allstars / Live at Mt.Fuji Jazz Festival 2002"".I don't know why this is sold as EW&F; album.Be careful to buy this."
4,Great Book,"I just picked a book that looked good off the shelf, and I picked a good one. Charles Sasser created a work of art when he wrote this book. I am currently reading other books from the Detachment Delta series and they are equally good. Sasser's military experience shows through in his work."
3,Hmm...,"From other reviews this seemed like the best deal, and part of the selling point was the window in the top to see the food without opening the cover. However the window easily fogs up making viewing impossible. On the positive side, it is easy to use, easy to clean, and does a great job cooking the food!"
2,Not happy with recover time,"I had a fabulous fryer for 10 years or so. This one I thought would be great to fry with, but I found that the recovery time from when you put the second batch in until the batch is ready to be too long.I feel that the temp never really gets quite hot enough to really fry anything. I am used to having, for example, spring rolls fried up in less than 5 minutes. They seem to take 10 minutes or so with this one. Same thing with chicken wings... just takes too long to get a nice golden crunch on everything.And do be very careful not to move the unit while frying, or the plug will come unplugged from the unit itself..it has a magnetic catch to it.The unit itself IS easy to clean, but what a pain to clean it when you don't like the way if fried in the first place."
4,Great so far!!,"We've used this a few times already for spring rolls, egg rolls, loukoumades (Greek donut/doughnut balls) and french fries its amazing for 2 people but if you have people over or a large family like 5 people or more i think this might just be a little small.The settings are great, cleaning is a breeze, LOVE the design and classic black color, light weight when empty, cools down in a decent time, good quality and workmanship so overall a fantastic purchase and a staple for any kitchen!"
2,the non-stick inner pot STICKS,was very disappointed. I received this as a gift and have attempted to use it twice and both times everything stuck. I tried it with and without the basket for battered fish and then chicken. Both times everything stuck. Already looking for something else to replace it.
4,Pretty Good Fryer,"Upgraded from the FryDaddy to this and I am quite pleased. I like the basket and the temp control features. The only negative with it, at least for me, is that the high temp is 375F and I wish that it could goup to 400F. Overall, I like mine."
1,Not a deep fryer,"I do the cooking, wife cleans up, so she hates why I deep fry. We tried this and it is mess free. BUT it just isn't hot enough!! French fries do not brown and actually absorb grease. If you leave food in waiting for it to brown it will dry out. I even tried thawing frozen food first, no luck. I asked my wife who she wanted to give it to, she said the trash. I'll stick with the Presto multicooker."
4,"Great product, works well. Still Smells up the house","We bought this a few weeks ago and have already enjoyed using it twice. Both times the house did seem to still smell as fried food, not as badly as other fryers but the carbon filter isn't 100% effective.It heats up quickly and is easy to use. It tripped our circuit both times we tried to use it but that could be our house, not the product design but I felt it is worth mentioning.It fits a good deal of food, we made the Smiley French Fries in it and it made enough for two and we sliced and fried an entire avocado without issues. The basket is wonderful and helps for minimal mess. The size of the unit isn't bad, it takes up a little more than a regular sized blender (width wise) and is about as high as our toaster.Overall, easy to use, minimal mess while using (haven't cleaned unit yet) and relatively inexpensive. Just light some candles when you plan on using or open the windows."
4,Works Great!,"I have a family of 6 and the size of this works great for us.We have made fresh french fries...battered fish & veggies. The unit held heat well (I made sure not to over load it) and cooked in time for everyone to get their dinner hot.The unit is large & with oil stored - it does need to be kept on the counter or in the pantry. The excellent price, cool touch sides and simple, good design makes this one a winner!"
4,Very Satisfield,So far I am very satisfied with this product. I was surprised how large the basket was. It handles the needs of our family quite well and I love the fact that oil isn't splattering all over my walls!
4,PRESTO DADDY,This was bought for a daddy who loves to fry and he loves it. Likes how the insert basket comes out and find it works well.
4,Great Fries,"I`m quite happy with this product..Have used it several times in the last 3 weeks,mostly for potato fries,but also for appetizers and tenderloins..Heats up quickly,easy to raise and lower the basket,lid opens and closes easily..Would recommend this product to family and friends."
1,"Sadly a let down, didnt work","I bought this as a gift, and since it was on sale, it wasn't opened until after the return period expired.My son and I hooked it up, filled it with oil and.... Nothing, zero, no heat, dead on arrival.Lesson learned, never buy anything early, or if you do, test it first, because this wound up being money flushed down the drain."
1,One star because I have to!,"I read the reviews, but like most people when you really want something, I only paid attention to the good reviews. Big problem. When it arrived, I was impressed with it's appearance, plugged it in, saw the indicator light, and threw away the packaging. Bigger problem. Went to cook with it for the first time & mid-use, the indicator light goes off, food is uncooked & soggy. I looked through the manual, and can confirm that my basket is less than half filled, and the unit wasn't touched during cooking, & I double checked the cord...nothing. It's just a chincey piece of.....something I can't use or return--waste of money--BIGGEST PROBLEM!"
1,Lack of quality control= No Buy,"I bought this as my second fryer. The third time I used this fryer, the oil went up and came out of the fryer then the lid wouldn't close properly and that's the end of it.Prior to buying this fryer, I had the presto fry daddy for years and it worked fine."
4,Is this product safe - Proposition 65,I just purchased this product but have not used it yet. I wonder has anyone else read [California residents: Click here for Proposition 65 warning.] Does that mean this thing causes cancer? Why would this be for California and not the whole country?
2,Hoping,"I have purchased this one after extensive searches.Even with my buy cost and import tax to the Philippines I think this is the right model.Of course I will update later after using.Difficult to buy a decent fryer here in the Philippines.3 years or more and I will be happy, going to use coconut oil at all times.Can not wait to drop in my battered shrimp and other goodies.I reckon this is the one for a use of 3 times a week."
1,Disappointing Presto Product Cool Daddy,"I bought this for my husband. He likes to cook fries, fish, pizza bits, etc. He went to use it and was steamed by the lid area when trying to open. Not safe. He was totally disappointed in the product. I bought it because it was Presto. We have two GE fryers and love them. I have a big fry daddy by Presto but it does not have a cover it is an original. It is fine. Any way I would NOT recommend this to anyone to buy.LBrown"
3,Not bad,"Use it only once after I bought it 2 months ago.I followed the instructions to fry chicken nuggets -- but only got over-fried. And if you do not have a large family or do not deep frying everyday, you may need think about:each time, you have to put a lot of oil in the fryer, which is a headache after frying.I switched to oven to cook nuggets, just nice taste with worry of oil and overburn."
5,Great deep fryer,"I have had this product for several months and use it for frying many foods. I like being able to lock the basket up and loading it, and then being able to close the lid and releasing the food into the hot oil. This is a great safety feature and reduces getting steamy oil from getting released in the kitchen. I am very pleased with this fryer and recommend it to anyone who is looking for a great fryer. Great price for the product."
4,Worth The Price and Works Great,"I never wanted a deep fryer that requires a lot of oil. I've used this deep fryer for making fries, chicken wings and fisballs. I owned a deep fryer before that stopped functioning on me after using it a few times. This fryer has never failed me yet. Excellent product."
2,Does not get hot enough,I bought this at Walmart. I've owned 3 other deep fryers and this one is the worst of any of the deep fryers I've owned. I've measured the temperature with a digital thermometer before and during frying. The problem with this unit is that the element is not powerful enough to maintain the temperature after dropping items into the deep fryer. It takes 20 minutes to reach near the target temperature. The unit is not worthy of making great deep fried food.. period.
2,Doesn't come up to proper temperature,"I ordered this when the cord on my 10-year-old Granpappy fryer finally gave out, thinking that the temperature control, hinged lid, and removable oil pot constituted an upgrade. Unfortunately, after roughly six uses, this fryer no longer heats up past 325 degrees (measured with a candy thermometer), even when allowed to preheat for a half an hour. I also tried another (more expensive) brand with the same type of configuration (see-through hinged lid) with the exact same shortcoming. I also really miss the airtight plastic storage lid that came with the Granpappy; I must admit to having ruined batches of oil after the first use because I am too lazy to empty the oil into another container for the next use. I have just ordered another Granpappy; hopefully, it will be as reliable as my last one was."
4,Nice features - low price,"This is a great little fryer. It cooks enough for 2 servings at a time, do not overload. It has a nice list of features. The basket is very handy, the temperature guage and ready light work well and the lid with vents and a filter help reduce the grease smell in your house. Some foods with a lot of moisture will not fry well with the lid closed and even with the lid closed you will not eliminate the odor completely. I set this up on my stove when I use it so that I'm able to use the exhaust fan as well and then I am able to eliminate all of the smell. It cleans up nicely and I'm able to store the oil in it between uses for weeks.The previous reviews clearly were not using as this is intended. I suspect they were overfilling with oil/food/both."
3,great little fryer,"This fryer is way better than the one I bought a few years ago [the fry baby]. The only word of caution I want to share with folks is to really remove the ice crystals from food before putting in the fryer. The ice crystals make the oil boil up too much and will cause leakage. I had this happen the first time I fried, and since then I rinse the chicken wings under cool water and shake em off before putting them in the basket.If anyone is wondering, it takes a bottle and a half of cooking oil to get to the ""max fill line"", which is where they recommend it to be.The cooking/draining basket is probably the best feature of the product because you can let the oil drain off before putting the food on paper towels. I've noticed a lot less grease on my paper towels after letting the food drain for a couple of minutes."
1,CoolDaddy is too cold.,"Length:: 3:00 MinsI really wanted to like this one, but as anyone who know anything about fryers knows, temp is key!This one was at least 40 degrees low w/o food and 60 degrees low with only one tortilla worth of chip! That tells me that, in addition to the thermostat being off, the oil container doesn't have enough mass; Oil has about half the thermal mass of water, so a big thick metal oil container is needed for a quick temperature rebound. 375 is barely enough for most frying, but 310 is too low. That means greasy food and a clogged heart. Returned."
1,Super disappointing,"It says the max temp it should reach is 375. My deep fry thermometer however shows it only reaches 325. That explains why my batch of fried chicken came out bloody even though I cooked it for the recommended 15 minutes at the highest setting. Clearly a max deep fry of 325 is not appropriate for deep frying any foods, let alone to ensure they're cooked to a safe temp to eat. Also, the name CoolDaddy is misleading. The outside of the unit is anything but cool when in use."
4,Great fryer,"We have had this fryer for quite a while now and it gets regular use. the basket is failry generous and it is easy to use. I especially like the black color as it tends to not show up the dirt and smudges that a white body does. Regardless of cleaning a fryer will get dirty.One note on this fryer. do not fill it to the full line while cold or when you lift the basket out of the hot oil it will not clear the oil level and the bottom of the basket will remain in the oil not allowing the food to drain.1-15-2012Still works great. appearance wise, it has seen better days. but holding up under heavy use and have yet to have any problems with it."
4,Great product,I had always wanted a good deep fryer so I finally treated myself to one. I'm very happy with this product. Easy set up & clean. And my chicken wings come out to perfection!! I use my fryer on a regular basis. I recommend this product
3,8 months of life and DOES NOT get hot anymore :(,I rec'd this around the holiday last dec... I've been using this fryer a great deal (about 3-5 times a month)... I was so happy to have this fryer... It was so easy to fry chicken and fries for the kids no worries... But the past month or so when i fried food it didn't get as crispy as it used to... I think it's hottness is on it's edge... I'm so sad... I really miss those crispy fried chicken :(
5,hard to find,I got this item four years ago and just love it to this day sad to say I recently moved and lost the magnetic cord and is having a very hard time finding a replacement cord is strongly considering just buying another love it love it love it
3,"great fryer, short life","I had this fellow for about a year and thought it was great. I used it mostly for frying eggplant parm, chicken parm, fried chicken parts, eggrolls... that sort of thing. I was always happy with the results until a couple weeks ago I was all set to fry some eggplant and the cool daddy was just too cool. (It wasn't heating up.) Needless to say, I'm on here looking for a new fryer."
2,oil overflowed,"i didnt have mine very long, but for the few times i used it the food came out good.however, when i last used it, the oil overflowed! all i did was set the basket with food in to start cooking. i didnt over fill the oil or the basket, so i dont know why that happened. i'm afraid to use a deep fryer again because of this."
3,Not so cool daddy,"Mine heats up quick and does a good job keeping splatter to a minimum with the lid that closes before you lower the basket. The name implies that it is cool to the touch but that is NOT the case. It gets very warm to nearly hot to the touch. Also if you do not manually control the lid when you push the button to open it, it will come off."
2,"When it worked, worked well but short life span","Well I used this thing maybe 6-7 times for wings and it worked great. I cleaned it between most fryings, mainly the aluminum frying container. Went to use it for SB Sunday and the light would not come on or heat up. I made sure I didnt mess with the contacts but oh well. So have to say rather displeased with it by going kaputt on me so early and I did take care of it quite well."
4,Does the job!,Bought this a couple of weeks ago and so far I have to say that I am rather impressed.....I love that the oil chamber is removable and dishwaser safe....doesn't stink up the house too much either.....I did a thermometer test and it's pretty accurate....when set at 375 (high) it went to 385 degrees....not too bad.
5,Love this thing!,"Works fantastic, love this thing! I'm so glad I got it for my boyfriend for his birthday. Everyone in the house enjoys it. It heats up quickly, the basket locks just above the oil with the handle so you can put things in or take things out without worrying about the oils splashing around. The viewing window is convenient. Just love everything about it."
3,It's Cool.,"Basically...The Fryer was a little too big for my taste...but it fries just the right amount in time for my family of 4.When we first received the Fryer...the latch for the filter area broke..so we had to send it back.Also, when you push the open button...WARNING: the top lid portion springs up really fast...causing the spine of the attached area too much force tension ....will probably break sooner if you don't hold onto the lid everytime you open it to prevent it from springing up too fast.When we fried something in it for the first time...there was a horrible plastic smell....but only for the first time. Also, would recommend that you place the whole thing on your stove top when frying for the first time because it puts off alot ...I mean alot of smoke....after reusing the oil for the second and third time etc...it didn't smoke that much...and worked GREAT.Easy to clean and use..and I love the size and shape of the wire basket. I wish the lid mechanism was different though."
4,Bought as a gift...,"and the recipient still uses it on a weekly basis. They fry everything from meats to deserts and have been very satisfied with it. The only thing I have heard negative is that it takes a bit for the oil to heat up, but they are not usually in a hurry so it is not a real issue to them."
2,A Great Fryer But.......,"My husband and I bought this fryer and totally loved how crispy and delicious our chicken turned out. The first time we used it was for a party of about 25 people, so we were frying up a storm. But towards the end of the day after frying a lot of chicken we noticed something: A portion of the plastic that covers the outer layer of the fryer MELTED. Yes, melted. There was a big hole where plastic used to be. We were astonished.And we returned the damaged fryer to Amazon. We considered buying another one, but were too worried it might happen again. So, very regretfully, I have to give this fryer a low rating."
5,Great Deep Fryer,"I bought this fryer as a gift for our son last Christmas. They have used it several times over the year, and have absolutely no complaints on it."
4,Presto 05442 CoolDaddy Cool Touch Electric Deep Fryer,"I really like it, but the fraying pan is just aluminum and doesn't have nonstick coating on it?! Product description says "" removable nonstick interior"", and on the pictures you can see the interior is dark color, not shiny aluminum. I'm kind of disappointed about that."
5,Presto CoolDaddy,"This deep fryer is every thing it claims to be. We fried fish inour fryer and it came out crispy on the outside and very moist onthe inside. I followed instructions about timing and amount of oil(we used peanut oil) and the fish came out a nice golden brown everytime. I always tell people to try Amazon when you want to purchasesomething. I like the feature, you close the lid before lowering thebasket into the oil. A good price on a new item from Amazon."
4,One of the best deep fryers I have used,"The CoolDaddy is definitely a great deep fryer, especially for this price! I've used it 3x already since Christmas and it hasn't failed. The basket is awesome because you can lower the food into the oil instead of traditionally dropping it (literally) and having oil splash all over the place. The food came out crispy and even. I didn't have the problem of the oil not heating up to the right temp that some buyers had. If that happens you should return it OR just cook the food longer. My only complaint is that it uses A LOT of oil. Yes you can strain and reuse the oil (if you're in to that) but if not, plan to use half or even a whole large bottle of cooking oil each time. I guess it would have to be wider for it to use less oil. But then it would be too big to use in an everyday kitchen so I'm happy with this deep fryer. Must buy!"
4,It works fine for the lite stuff,I have had mine for about 6 months now and I use it 2 or 3 times a week. It is easy to clean. Cooks enought for 2 people just fine.
4,christmas gift,bought to give to son in law for christmas. arrived in time but they haven't had a chance to use it yet...will see
5,Exactly as advertised,Worth the price after several months of use and ownership cleanup easy. Also very to store ... Three more words
3,presto,we have not used this yet but it is exactly what my husband wanted and all the parts are included
3,Rating is for the size of the fryer,Did not get to use product thus cannot comment on that. If you are looking for a family size fryer this is not for you. The fryer seemed extremely small and would be good for frying for 1 or 2 people. Returned fryer as when using a deep fryer I am cooking for normally 4 or more.
2,cheap design,"When you press the button, the lid opens so forcefully that I am afraid the hot oil will spill out."
3,EASILY BROKEN,"I JUST BOUGHT THIS ITEM, AND THEN MY WIFE TRIED TO COOK SOME DEEP FRIED PORK, THE COVER OF THE DEEP FRYER JUST POP OUT AND CAME OUT APART EASILY BREAKING THE LOCKS OF THE FILTER.NOW WE ARE STILL USING IT BUT HAVE TO HOLD THE FILTER COVER IN PLACE TO SECURE. ITS NICE. WISH THEY COULD MAKE IT DURABLE NEXT TIME.JUST BEEN 2 WEEK SINCE THEN. WELL, GOOD LUCK ON U."
1,puppy smarts WASTE of $$$$$,"I waited for my video hoping it would help me train my puppy and give me more answers than I already know. It is a waste of hard earned money. It is so short, I went to take my puppy out for two minutes and the second lesson was over! I am very disappointed. Do NOT waste your money. This video does not tell you nearly as much as the first page in any puppy book!"
2,Puppy Ripoff,"$29.95 is a lot of money to pay for any video, but when that video is really poor quality and bad color, very very short, and won't even rewind except at watching speed, I indeed felt robbed. Some of the puppy lessons are useful, but I ceased believing she knew what she was doing when she said at the end that your puppy should be fully trained after doing this for 6 months. Six months!!! Do YOU want puppy poop in your house until 6 months? This is a real loser! By the way the lady is not a dog trainer. She's an actor."
5,Such a great DVD . . . I'm going back for more,Got the single Potty training DVD first at retail.It worked with such success I've got to get the full 5-topic DVD. I thought I had the puppy from hell until this DVD showed ME how simple it is to get a dog to understand what you want it to do. Found DVD format great for quick review. It's really more about traing us humans than the dogs I've decided!
1,Save your cash!!!!!,This video is worthless! It reminds me of a bad Saturday night live skit. The chapters are extremely short and contain very little useful information. I would not recommend this video to anyone!
2,PuppySmarts Lessons for a Lifetime DVD,"I wish I would have read the Aug 6, 2003 review from Bayside, NY before purchasing. I agree wholeheartedly. This DVD is ridiculously short and offers few problem-solving solutions for typical puppy behavior. It is more like a how-to for an unrealisticly perfect world, and assumes we all start out with a perfectly focused puppy. I wish I hadn't spent so much on it. It was not worth the price."
1,Puppy smarts video,"I did not feel this was worth the $, it is very basic and is similar to a home video. I received a book from the AKC free when I registered my pup that had better training info. I would not recommend this other than for a first time pet owner that has no idea of how to handle your new pup."
5,Extremely Helpful,"3 months ago I adopted a 1yr old beagle from a shelter. Unfortunately she was not potty trained. It was a nightmare and I was having more trouble than usual because she was already 1yr old. After watching this video and taking the time to follow each of the steps shown, it took me only a solid 2 weeks of training to stop the accidents in the house. I highly recommend this video not only for puppy owners, but for adult dogs as well. The video is put together in a very easy to follow, easy to learn from format."
1,This DVD is a joke and a rip-off,"This is by far the worst material I have seen on dog training. The chapters are short and most of them don't even show demonstrations of the techniques being described. You simply hear the voice-over of the narrator who sounds like she's reading from a script. Most of the time, what the narrator is saying does not correspond with the technique being demonstrated on the screen. Aby value to be gotten out of this series is extremely basic and rudimentary and certainly not worth the price. If you are looking for a DVD that demonstrates complete positive training, a better choice is:"
2,"Like an instructional DVD, but so much shorter!","While the material covered in this DVD is helpful and reasonably well-presented, it is so short that I am embarassed to have paid the price I did for it. The producer could easily have included material on other training topics most new puppy owners need. There would still have been plenty of time to relax and absorb the lessons. The Humane Society could have done better."
3,Overpriced,Very good lessons although there is very little return for the price charged. A poor return on investment as the totaltraining content time is about 25 minutes. There should have been a lot more content for money such as leash/walking training or doing tricks training. You will be amazed at how short this DVD actually is.
5,Excellent for first time dog owners,"As someone who works with animals daily in a vet's office, I highly recommend this DVD to our clients. It is short, concise, and easy to understand. Almost every day I see dogs that simply need a few minutes of training every day to become model pets. Most people are so busy that something short and easy like this is the only way they are going to get started training their dog.This DVD is not for all people. If you want to go beyond the basics, you should get something else, but this one is an excellent way to get started."
5,Well written,there are many well formulated and well written essays that deal with some of the mos tpressing debates in the orthodox world today. the second to last essays is excellent and worth reading. The final selections from the holocaust are very moving and inspiring.
4,Must...stop...laughing...!,"In spite of the tiny handful of typos, and the occasional plot hole, this is one wildly entertaining story. Just reading the premise was enough to get me interested, as I've always had a weakness for swords-and-sorcery style fantasy stories. Everyone knows Conan the Barbarian, thanks to Arnold. I think Ronan is a bit more real. And a lot more amusing. It's obvious the author likes to enjoy his work, and clear that he has a developed world for these characters. Definitely worth a read for anyone looking for a lighter story. Very amusing, if bloody, coming-of-age revenge story. I read the Kindle version, and it's worth it."
4,Good clean fun.,"Entertaining and not pretentious,even the villains are honest fun!The rest of the characters are nicely portrayed,and the pace is maintained in the two sequels."
4,The inner Barbarian,"I read this years ago and enjoyed it. It is funny and can be reread years later. To be truthful I read this when it was first published and reread it recently. I enjoyed it more the first time as I was younger and would have given it five stars, now that I am older I give it four."
4,Tommy Castro - Kill Your Pain With Soul Inflected Blues,"Tommy Castro has been a staple on the American blues circuit for well over a decade now and has carved out a loyal following. His brand of soul inflected blues owes as much to James Brown as it does to John Lee Hooker. Castro is a good guitarist with a nice voice. ""Painkiller"" is another strong album for Castro. 9 of the 12 tracks are originals with covers of Albert Collins, Freddie King and Mike Schermer thrown into the mix. Highlights include ""Love Don't Care"", ""Painkiller"", ""A Good Fool Is Hard To Find"" which is a cool duet with Coco Montoya and ""It Ain't Easy Being Me"". Castro's brand of soul inflected blues may not be for everyone, but he does what he does very well and this is another fine release from Tommy and the band."
2,Peaked too soon?,"I'm sorry, but Tommy Castro will probably never better his first album, Exception to the Rule. I was deeply disappointed after the exit of original drummer Shad Harris, but Castro did come back with the decent Right As Rain. But other than that first album, everything is hit or miss. And what's really missing on this album are his incredible guitar licks and throbbing bass grooves."
2,Heel is very thin,The shoes look great and I loved the color however the heel is so thin you have to be a acrobat in the circus to maintain your balance.
2,A rather ho-hum outing,"I'm not a big Roches fan, though I like some of their stuff a lot. However, I found this album to be rather boring. The track with the most interesting lyrics is ""Eggshell,"" and those are kind of hokey.Overall, the lyrics are better than the melodies, which, after one listening, did not inspire me to put the CD back on the turntable. I recommend Suzzy's second album, or better yet, ""Zero Church,"" as a more worthwhile use of your money."
3,Ok for the price,"Finish is not as uniform as others I have had, but I guess you get what you pay for. For my needs it does the job"
2,scalpel handles #4,"I ordered the #4 handle and #20 blades. The blade DO NOT FIT the handle. The blades are very well packed and of high quality. Fortunatly, they fit in a #2 Exacto Handle."
4,Good handle,Pleased with the handle and ease of use. Fit the #24 blades I got for it and inserting and removal of the blades was fast.
2,NOT so perfect,"This trance mix is way to boring. I don't necasarily like trance always hardcore but this isn't even unique.It all sounds the same and there is no track you look forward to listening to. You begin listening to it and think, is this song over cause it sounds all the same when you notice you've listened to half the cd and it all sounded pretty much the same. The only song i liked was the 2nd one. Bottom line, this CD is the most perfect boring trance."
4,Great gift for your piano player,This was a gift for our daughter and she loves it! The music is not too easy and she is enjoying the challenges of learning these tunes!
3,May not meet your expectations for accuracy,"I ordered this book primarily for piano practice but also guitar reference. Even for an intermediate-level book, this should have had more accurate chord progressions and harmonies. On the very first song, Across the Universe, V1 guitar chords start D,(D), F#m. This sounds wrong to anyone who's heard the song! It should be D, F#m, D7. The piano arrangement sounds poor too. I wish I'd been able to preview a few pages before purchasing - I probably would not have purchased this particular book. Hopefully the rest of the book is better. On the positive side, the book has a good selection of classic Beatles tunes, and would be useful for intermediate-level guitar and piano practice, if you're not too fussy about the integrity of the harmonies or chord accuracy."
4,Playtime With the Beatles!,"This book is ideal for piano players and it is also good for guitar references. The only real drawback this book had was the chord progressions were not fully accurate. For people who play guitar, just try using some of the chords in this book for some of the songs and your ears will tell you that this just ain't quite right.You will find an excellent selection of Beatle songs and intermediate guitarists will undoubtedly get a lot out of this book. If you are a stickler about the harmonies and the chord accuracy, this is not the book for you."
2,New Item ordered was not new when received,"The problem was not the publisher of the book, our problem is that we ordered and paid for a new item. We received a book with damaged corners and worse a brown sticky substance on the edges of 2/3's of the pages in the book. It is difficult to play music when the pages do not turn easily. Further, we wrote to Amazon customer service regarding the fact that we received a damaged book even though we ordered and paid for a new item. Amazon did not even acknowledge our complaint much less check in to the reason we did not receive the product in the condition ordered."
1,Meh,"Some songs are accurate, but only some. I checked the book for a copywriter note. There was not one to be found. I guess they didn't want to pay the royalties for the Beatles music so they stuck together notes that are in the ball park."
2,Cliche short.,"Nice digital animation: cliche stroytelling.I saw this short on a compilation. If you want this short, why not go a head and purchase all the 75th Academy Award nominated shorts. Better value:ASIN: B0001EQI2Y"
3,Informative,Very had read. Vocabulary and messaging makes reading this like trudging through mud. Other than the hard read the message and content are startling and embarrasing to me as a non-indian human being
5,Great!,"I absolutely love this necklace, and was a reasonable price. I have had many compliments. The information given was accurate."
2,Overly complex,"This is a well thought out scientific publication. This is not a oral history, there are no stories or descriptions of how they lived in the past. I'm sure that was part of the anthropological study but none of it was published in this book. It was a dissappointing purchase."
3,Entertaining but not Sachar's best,"This is reasonably entertaining and thought provoking book but not Sachar's best work. I much more highly recommend ""Holes"" and ""A Boy in the Girl's Bathroom"". Although there are a couple of inventive plot twists here, and the book does provoke thought regarding our value systems and human interaction, the middle portion of the book during which the ""curse"" was inflicted upon the main character seemed to drag a bit. In addition this book was not nearly as humorous as the two previously mentioned novels. As far as the obscenities are concerned, if the liberal use of four letter words and protracted discussions surrounding the significance of ""flipping someone off"" are not inappropriate then there is no concern. Personally, I felt obligated to ""censor"" certain sections as I read the book aloud to my nine year old daughter. I would recommend the book for 12 year olds and up."
2,Parents: Read this first,"I have a 7 year old daughter who reads constantly. I try to read one or two books by the author before I let her read the author's work, particularly with modern books. I have read several Sachar books and I have been pleased. Although this book is meant for an older audience, I'm sure many younger children, like my daughter, will pick it up unknowingly. (She wanted a more challenging book) I was disappointed with the constant use of vulgar language throughout the book. The story line is riviting and very thoughtful but the language is highly inappropriate for children. Children imitate art... parents, read it first."
5,Mom in Amherst,"My daughter read this book to me and I couldn't wait to hear it every night. What an excellent, timeless story. I highly recommend it to anyone. It is a good selection for a middle schooler, girl or boy."
1,Shocked !,"I would never recommend this to children in the age range 9-12. My 12 year old is reading this book and there are so many curse words that I am going to reccomend that this book be taken out of the school library. There are things like A--HOLE, A--BITE, DIP-HIT and there is a reference to sticking something up someones A--. Everyplace I have a blank there should be an S.I think this is a horrible childrens book."
1,disappointing!,"My 10 year-old daughter and I enjoy Louis Sachar books immensly, but this one was disappointing. Having to explain to her what flipping someone off and the heavy use of obscene words is not what we expected in one of his books. I immediately returned the book and explained the problem to Scholastic. They also were shocked by what was in the book. We need to be diligent in our effort to keep this kind of writing out of our childrens books. We have to monitor TV and computer and now we have to monitor our childrens books? Louis Sachar was a good author, let's hope he goes back to his old writing style."
5,Amazing!,"If your one of those people who likes to take a peek aat the last page of a book to see what happens, the last page of this book will befuddle you completely. Louis Sachar again uses his unique writing style,where he writes what kids and teens are really like,not like other writer's who place their character's in a perfect world.He rights the reality of teens,like cussing, and flipping people off,and dating. I hope he writes more books like Holes and The Boy Who Lost His Face."
4,Good Book for Teens,This book was good for teens my age because it's about life at their age. It's also about what there going through
5,THE BEST BOOK EVER!,"This book was so amazing. David is a normal kid trying to fit in with the popular kids, and when he helps an operation to take Mrs. Bayfield's cane, he flips her off and gets cursed... Or does he? After that David loses his old friends but gains a bunch of new ones that remind everyone of the three stooges. To top that, things like his pants falling down while asking someone out, or his zipper being down when he walks into class happen to him. I couldn't put this book down. My mom usually reads the same books I read if I say they are good, and she loved it too. I had read Holes not that long ago, and thought it was great, but this book is one million times better. I really suggest that people read this."
1,Language so bad you can't post it in a review,"I tried to post a review with snippets from the book, but received a rejection notice from Amazon stating that the language was unacceptable for any review (even for adult materials). Yeah, it's that bad.What's in the book goes way beyond just a little naughty or even how kids talk (mine is 8).""You want a hammer shoved up your _ss?"" - Chapter 4Lots of talk about girls with no clothing and sneaking taking pictures of girls with no clothingFlipping people off...The list goes on and on. Let's see if this version of the review makes it past Amazon's filters."
1,Disappointed,"This Book is a wonderful story about peer pressure. Unfortunately, the unnecessary use of four letter words makes this book one that I would not want my children to read. Yes, one might hear these words on TV, but that does not make it right. I am sorry the author did not have enough faith in this book to let the great story stand alone, without the four letter words."
1,Don't let the author's name fool you on this one,"This book is by the popular author of Holes, so many students may find this title and think they will enjoy it because they enjoyed reading Holes. The main character is so spineless and desperate to be cool that he stands by and watches as his friends torment an elderly neighbor lady. He has a fascination with flipping people the bird and who decided it was an offensive gesture. There is also a lot of language that is inappropriate for upper elementary readers. You may hear that kind of language from kids, but it is unnessary for an author to encourage or condone it. Don't waste your time, there are too many good books out there"
3,"Good, but...","I rated this book with 3 stars because (1) it's not the most recent edition, (2) it's not spiral bound, and (3) if you want to hear the songs as played by the author, you have to buy not one, but two, CDs that come separately and are not even offered as options when you buy the book. Not much more is added in the newer edition, but it does come spiral bound, which is quite helpful when you're trying to keep the pages open to a particular song or exercise. Otherwise, there are lots of songs for 4-, 5-, and 6-hole Native American flutes, and the instruction is good. Recommended, with the above caveats."
5,"Mel Bay Flute Magic"" An Introduction to the Native American Flute",This artist who wrote the book is an accomplish Native Americn Flute player. His book is very informative and it also comes with a CD that allows you to practice the techniques that he is teaching you.
3,Not what I expected,"If you were expecting a book to learn how to build a flute, forget it. The book only glosses over history and construction. The book is basically a primer for a newbie that just wanted to learn about the Native American Flute and some suggestions as to how to play the new flute they purchased. If you want to learn how to build a flute get the Flute Shop. Not worth the trouble to return it. It at least has some good history lessons for the book shelf."
1,Not Happy,I bought this book and returned it.I thought there would be many tunes written in tablature. Instead there were 5 simple tunes in tab and a bunch tunes in what was called tablature but was in classic notation.If I had time to learn to read music I would not have bought this book.
4,Sticky Fun!!,If you like/love South Park then this is a book that you will have to put on you wish list or get. You can make Kenny die anyway you want. You can even make Stan and Wendy kiss! There are ten diffrent backgrounds that you can put them in. Even on each background there are little clips taken from that episode of South Park. This is a awesome book that the whole family will love....maybe.
4,"great for south park fans, gets boring though.","First of all id like to say the book is NOT 96 pages long. It has 10 real south park episode scenes. It comes with 4 sheets of south park window stickers. The stickers offer a wide variety of south park characters but may be missing some of your favorite obscure characters. Its fun when you first get it to put the stickers in different spots on the scenes but it gets boring after awhile. They make good stickers to put up on your car window, or home windows for fun when your done with the book. Its a great book for a die hard south park fan to have. If you've seen practically all the south park episodes i recommend it to you, if you've only seen a few or half of them and don't know much about the show you won't understand the book as well, and its not worth the money for you."
4,Great old video,Item arrived on time and in condition promised. Liked the video very much. Lost the first one but wanted to purchase it again for my collection.
5,A classic video album,"I have watched this album in the format of LD for a long time ago,once I search in amazon recently, I found this album in DVD format,I bought it & found this video is the same & with much more betterimage & sound quality, I,m really enjoyed!Peter"
2,IT DOES NOT LOOK LIKE DVD,"The picture for this film is not clear. So if you are looking for quality, it is not going to be found in this film."
1,MADE ME WANT TO THROW UP!!!,"I do not remember the last time i read a book in which the characters were sooo one dimensional, the plot was so BORING, the heroine was so UNBELIEVABLY weak, the hero was such a JERK ! he pretty much tried to rape her a couple of times and she supposedly enjoyed it???? come on now!! I'm SOOO disappointed i bought this book i skipped parts of the book (which i rarely do) and only finished it because i was hoping the book would pick up at some point. I hate being so negative but i really can't think of one positive aspect of this story. I would give it 0 stars if i could. Buy (or read) this book only if u want to be bored and disgusted to tears by a twisted plot (where rape = love), a couple that you do not care about and want to waste your $ and time. I can't believe i just threw away 4 hours of my life to that book - it took so long because there were times i just threw the book away in disgust!!"
3,Only You,I have liked all of Lowell's reads but this was too bland for me. There is a plot but it is weak. It doesn't have the sizzling sexuality of her other books. I will not re-read.
1,Don't waste either your money or your time...,"This is one of the very few times I have not been able to finish a book. Bad premise, slow as molasses plot line and characters I couldn't bring myself to care even a tiny bit about. If a woman has to be coerced into touching a man - over and over again - that's not romance. Pick out a different book for your rainy afternoons."
5,WOW,"Lowell writes such great characters. I was moved to being close to tears 2x's in this book! I am not one to cry very easily at all! These characters are so real and the plot is very good, you actually learn something about gold mining, rock formations and spanish quests for gold too!"
2,Good but nah....,"I only got this book because of the title. I was going to use the same one for a book that I was writing. So I vowed that as soon as I was done reading it, I would burn it. Well, I still have it...got to build up my romance collection anyway since my dad threw all of my mom's away! I was so mad! But anyway about the book...I am a true believer of real love romance, not smut and porno content. Did they really do those kinds of things back then? It's like you're witnessing what was going on in the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah before they were destroyed. I have seen and read better ones, but if you are into that kind of 'love' or whatever you want to call it, by all means get this book..."
2,Repetitive and predictable,"The premise of the ""innocent"" girl wagering herself in a card game seemed promising, but it went real flat real fast. I dont believe I've ever read this author before so why did I already feel like I'd read the book? It's got a very standard plot, cookie cutter characters, and little to no character development---basically everything you think is going to happen happens, only I found this author's version of the story to be a little more nauseating than usual (the heroine is a sachharine Mary-Sue who basically lets the hero walk all over her). I dunno, I guess some people prefer it that way, but I also had more trouble than usual getting through all those long drawn out repetitive love scenes. I'd recommend Elizabeth Thornton's books over this (for some reason this book made me want to read her instead)."
3,Book great -- condition awkward,"This author makes the Book of Isaiah understandable and puts the history all in perspective and shows how it fits with other books of the Bible. However, the publisher bound the book they sent to Amazon with the first 25 pages at the end instead of the beginning of the book. If you can deal with that, then I highly recommend getting this book from Amazon because the price was less than other places."
4,As advertised,This was just about what I was looking for...sort of explains Isaiah one chapter at a time. Overall I was pretty happy with this book. I think just a little more historical background to start would have been nice; but thats a minor point. I would recommend this book to someone (like me) with limited previous knowledge of Isaiah.
5,More than a story to be listened to,This book proved to be highly entertaining for my 2 grandchildren recently. The simple text and delightful pictures provided lots of opportunities for additional interaction with them.
2,alright,"Basically an ok book for the ny scene. Not much in the way of content though. Not much pieces, mostly local bombing and pics of some of the writers with their eyes blurred."
3,OVER-RATED,"I love the idea of the book~ A ""blackbook"" that's alive with photos of the writers....but truth be told, this book is nothing less than a quickly assembled capital venture...Many of the writers in this book are questionably ""all city"" and about a third of them ARE'NT EVEN FROM NEW YORK~!... It was obviously put together by someone who looked no further than 2 DEGREES OF SEPARATION to find the artisits for the book. It is neither a fair representation of NYC graffiti nor an artisitic feature book... You will see handstyles (""tags"") of the featured artists, but there is little more than a handful of actual WORK from writers.... It is an interesting take on graffiti documentation and I suppose a nice addition to an already well established collection of such books... but you'll flip through it once and never pick it up again."
5,Greatly Enjoyable,"As a fantasy fan, I look for numerous qualities in a fantasy story. Perhaps the most important quality in a work of fantasy fiction is characterization. A fantasy novel should contain believable characters who in some way or another remind the reader of him or herself, or of someone he or she may know. These characters must also have emotions, and cannot be completely stoical all the time. I have found these two qualities consistantly in Feist's works and congratulate him for it."
2,Going down...,"OK, ""Magician"" (the first book of this series) had something: it was original and fast paced, and had interesting characters. There was more action per page than in most fantasy books, and the plot twists were admirable.""Silverthorn"", tough, is flat and predictable. If I could go back in time I would consider ""Magician"" a standalone work, and skip reading the rest of the Riftwar saga."
2,Do not buy,"The first two books in the series, Magicians: apprentice, and Magicians: Master, were well written and enjoyable. Silverthorn, on the other hand, is set in the same world as the first two books, but has removed the best parts of the magic and story arc. The series was great up to this point, but I would not recommend the third installment."
4,"Fine, well written piece of fantasy work","Excellent and fascinating piece of work. Feist brings us again in ecstacy with this well written book. Although not matching the brilliance and innovating aspect of the first two books; magician;apprentice and master, it is still a comprehensible and suspensful piece of writing. The adventures of Puc and Arutha, together with the introduction of Robbie, takes this saga to a new and refreshing level. This saga is not over yet!"
3,This is turning into a gimmick,"After thoroughly enjoying the first two books in the series, I found this something of a disappointment. If anyone has ever seen the children's cartoon ""Once upon a Forest"", they will understand how the theme of heroic band struggling to find a magic herb to save their friend may become tiring. I does manage to hold up the style from Magician, but the characters developed little from the first books. How you can get several series out of this concept is beyond me."
4,"A Heroic, white and shiney Prince!","I like the ""Magician"" better, but this sequel is also ok. It is taking a different path from the Magician story, only merging again at the end. It is a story of a Prince who is trying to save his Princes. Pretty intense, almost scary many times.Not as good as the previous book, a little bit more classic story."
4,"Good, but not as grand as Magician","For those who love fantasy and the worlds of Midkemia and Kelewan, this novel will not disapoint. However, I feel it lacked the character depth and plot intensity of Magician, as well as the shear awesome power of the previous novel (or two novels, if you've just been introduced to the series). It is a good read, though, and totally worth the price. I hope A Darkness at Sethanon will be as stunning a conclusion as the Riftwar Saga needs..."
5,Loved the Book,came in on time. looked great and was how it was described in the description. thanks a lot for the great book!
1,Had to quit reading it,"When I was halfway through the first volume (The Magician) I could not wait to order TWOF last volume and so I also ordered Silverthorn and the next volume of the Riftwar Saga. If I had waited till the end of The Magician I wouldn't have bought the next 2. So I have tried to read Silverthorn but it is even worse than The Magician and it got to the point where instead of enjoying my time reading I was just reading very fast trying to finish it asap, so I quit. This must be the first time I do not finish a book to at least give it a chance. I bought them based on the good reviews and I have to think that the are all teenagers because the story lacks depth, it is not engaging, the characters and relationships are shallow. If you want good fantasy try TWOFT, Song of Fire and Ice, The Name of the Wind or Way of Kings."
