1,Don't waste your time or money.,"The predominant concern of this boring, totally unsatisfying work appears to be finding every conceivable way of asking ""What If"" without attempting to answer anything. Written in a plodding, pseudo-intellectual style, the pace alone is enough to have bored even Hitler to death. None of the various scenarios presented are brought to anything resembling a conclusion, leaving the reader with nothing more than he or she started with. While overly simplistic at times, ""The Hitler Options"" is a far more enjoyable treatment of the subject matter. ""What If?"" doesn't crash and burn; it never takes off."
5,interesting life and times of an airline pilot,"Arthur Whitlock retraces his career from wartime pilot to the modern jet age. Reminising the triumphs, and the tragedies, and mostly the funny side of flying, he profusely illustrates the book with his superb drawings. A book I found difficult to let go of, highly interesting, superbly amusing, thoroughly recommended. A gem."
3,"Polite, derivative bop","Mr. Zoller is clearly an outstanding talent, best showcased in slow ballads like ""When it's time"". On that tune, Lee Konitz is eerily reminiscent of Paul Desmond circa Take Ten, and Zoller's guitar is a dead ringer for Jim Hall's. The remaining songs on this CD sound pleasant, but derivative and lacking in melodic clarity."
3,too large for my taste...,"I ordered these at the half price sale - you win some and you lose some. These are just as pictured, but the scale is what is missing from the description. WOW these are big. The bright blue color makes them look like soemthing from a bubblegum machine. It's hard to imagine what you would wear these with. They are too big for casual everyday earrings and too bright to wear anywhere but Tucson in the summer.yikes!"
2,"Very small, more metal than stone","The actual stone is very small in these earrings. Although theyre cute from the front,looking at them from the side shows alot more metal than stone.If you buy these, ignore the reviews that say these are large sized earrings... They're stud sized..."
3,color not what it says or shows,"Dealt with the color.. but they turned green last year,lol. the posts and backs :( ... kinda makes you wonder if they are truly white gold."
1,This doesn't work with Genesis.,Do not buy this AC adapter for a Genesis.It makes the Genesis make a buzzing sound.It works fine with a SNES but I haven't used it with a NES.
1,Don't waste your time,"This review is for a SEGA GENESIS GEN 1.The only thing here to say is that when you use this cable, you will have problems like this: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7VR1Va6SwUThere is a loud humming noise and detuned sound that comes from the TV speakers when you use this power cable. It said it works for the Sega Genesis on the package; looks to me like somebody forgot to actually test it out.If you own a Sega Genesis Gen 1, DO NOT buy this cable."
1,don't buy,adapter is only 9 volts so does not work for sega or snes don't fall for the illusion that it is a three in one it only works for the the nes.
1,Displeased...,"I had purchased 2 of these at 2 separate times and it worked for about 2 weeks! I have no idea why but, the power box started to fry almost causing a fire! The smell that released from the box was a burning smell and strong! I had considered the fact that may have been the power strip and changed it and then purchased a new adapter and not only did the same issue occur but the wire was melting as well!!! To each there own but i refuse to buy something hazardous to my family, like this product has shown me to be!!!KmK"
1,P.O.S. Junk,"I bought it for my Super Nintendo so I can not attest to whether or not it works for the NES or Genesis, but for my SNES it causes large discolouration lines to run down the screen while I'm playing. It's very distracting and I'm worried that it could potentially cause damage to my system. You're better off trying to find a universal adapter or an original Nintendo made used adapter."
1,didnt work,didnt work!!!!...dont waste your money.. does not work for then snes. there was a big green line going down my screen .. i knew it wasnt my console because it was working fine a few weeks ago...after further investigation i found out it was the power cord.. dont believe me? read everyone else's review...shipping was fast but product was BAD
3,"Mediocre, but useable","Of course, you could just go read the other reviews, but in case if you're still not sure, or if this is the first review you've seen, lemme tell you this: This thing is definitely a must-buy if you are wanting to keep your Super Nintendo (SNES) alive. I haven't tried it out for the NES (Which is why you should go read another review), but the Genesis certainly won't work with it. This is why it has a 3-star review. It depends on the system you own. The Sega Genesis won't work with it, but the NES and Super Nintendo do."
1,Sega adpater.,I returned this because it didn't fit my sega. Ihave yet to receive my money back. There is no way this adapter would fit a Sega Genisis.
3,Get's the job done,"I ordered this specific cord b/c it said nothing about being a ""retro"" cord. Some of the other ac power cords said they were retro meaning they had two cords coming from the adapter. I didn't want a second cord just dangling on the ground, that's why I got this one. However, there is a second cord. That's not shown in my picture, nor described in the description . It isn't horrible. Just weird having a 2nd cord hanging there that isn't being used. It has brought my 15 year old ( or older ) SNES back to life , so it's serving it's purpose. I just wish it would've been more clear about the true description."
3,"Nice hinges, not so nice instructions","They look well built and you can adjust how far the door will open, so that saves you having to build-in a stop. Since the sink is usually sitting behind these hinges it is difficult to temp mount them and see how things will lay out. I am on my 4th set of drilled holes and I still don't like how it lays out. A simple instruction on what the set-back should be and how far in on the doors to mount them would have saved me a lot of work. The instructions shipped with the hinges are wishful thinking."
3,Not the expected.,"Didn't expect that the tip out would tip all the way to a 45 degree angle. Also, that the length has to be cut to size and that you have to order more end caps and hindges to accomodate the two halves."
4,Piaf in Italian: lovely but still French,Lovely Italian rendition of Piaf's songs. Full of energy. Milva's voice is rounder and less raspy than Piaf's. The melancholic side of the songs remains quintessentially French.
5,Just as good as OEM,"I've had my Troy Built 33"" Mower for years, I love it. Glad I can get these blades. Work just as good as the OEM did back in day!"
3,Don't bother with the remix,"I like Safri quite a bit, but for the extra few bucks- it's really not worth the remixes. Their second CD is worth the price- good stuff on the disk (some of their best actually) but the 'bonus CD' is trash. Lots of mindless 'boom, boom boom' nonscense. Save the money for something else and just get the regualr CD version."
2,Descriptions of movements difficult to follow.,"I'm not a fitness fanatic -- I just want a stronger back and less neck and shoulder pain. This book is probably better for a reader already familiar with exercise terminology. It was difficult for me to follow the written descriptions of movements, and photos weren't comprehensive enough.Hopefully others will have much better luck, or maybe aren't as dense as I am."
5,"the words that changed the world, azuza street sermons",Excellent! A must for any real God fearing person with a hunger for the real truth
4,Plastic beads for rock tumblers,"These beads are to keep rocks In a tumbler from striking each other with full force while in a tumbler. They did what they were asked of them. Please note they are not in a plastic bag in the box, and opened without care, these beads may remind you of your mistake for years to come"
3,Its a small box,I was expecting about twice the size. I just didn't check close enough before ordering.It will work for what I'm doing.
1,unhappy,Flowers arrived in questionable condition.Started to wilt berfore ever opening completely. Had to be discarded before ever enjoying the blooms.
2,Not as good as the picture,"Delivered in 1 or 2 days, faster than i thought, but they don't look as pictured. Have purchased nicer flowers at Albertson's for less"
1,Bazooka Bubblegum 275 count tub,"The original Bubblegum tub was exactly as I expected. The gum was fresh and each piece contained the original Bazooka Joe comic strip everyone knows and loves. The pieces are slightly smaller than the old days, but the taste and flavor are the same. Package arrived undamaged and in a timely manner. It put a big smile on my child's face, I can tell you that! Thank you."
3,Not exactly what I thought it would be,I find the title a little deceiving. On the other hand it is quite a radical interpretation of ancient civilization.
2,Not What the Title Suggests,"I love books on Atlantis and ancient Egypt, so I was captivated by the title of this book. After reading several rambling, incoherent chapters, I gave up, feeling misled and regretting the loss of my $20. There is virtually nothing about Atlantis, or at least nothing that Atlantis-lovers don't already know (like Plato's quotes). This book is strange: rambling about the earth's magnetosphere and delving into the esoteric significance of the Nile.In summary, it's full of things you don't care to learn, and the information, as a whole, just doesn't ring true."
3,Nothing like other john o farrell books,"I bought this book becauseni had thoroughly enjoyed other John O ' Farrell books in the past, especially his sense of humor. But this book, while it got a smile or two was not really funny. Or insightful... The story is not believable, and the outcome even less so and reminded me of a bad hollywood romcom in terms of predictability. I didnt have a hard time finishing the book, the writing is easygoing and pleasant, but it gave me as much as a good magazine article would, nothing more"
4,plenty to laugh at,"The first half of this book is downright hilarious, as O'Farrell deftly skewers our child-centric culture, and satirizes parents who will go to any length to ensure their child's safety and success. Unfortunately the second half is less satisfying: our heroine never really admits that what she did was flat-out wrong, and the ending rings a bit false. Even so, if you've ever been even the teeniest bit tempted to somehow work your kid's great test score into a conversation with other parents, you'll find plenty to laugh at. It's a quick read, fine summer fluff that may leave you examining your own behavior when you're done."
3,Too cute,This is one I would probably have passed on if I had seen it in a bookstore. Just not all that interesting.
5,No surprises,"The toothbrushes I ordered were exactly what I expected, and at less cost than my local retail discount store."
3,Silent film review,"If you want to see a early silent film of the Civil War, this is for you.I did not think the seller explained what you would be getting. I wouldnot have purchased it. No narration, all early silent film . It is notwhat I thought it to be by the sellers description."
1,weight training intermediate,"this is worse than a movie video. The quality is very poorthe sound etc. Charles Glass may be a world famous training buthe can not talk on camera. Not worth the money, join a gym."
4,great hair tool,"I really like this curling iron. Good cord, heats up fast. I am just a little disappointed because I thought the product was new, and it has obviously been used before.The cord wasn't even coiled or wrapped."
5,Enchanted Evening,"I was not in the audience on the night this recording was made at Yoshi's in Oakland, California, but I wish I had been, as it must have been one enchanted evening. Williams is at her best with Ray Drummond and Victor Lewis; the three of them play as one. Williams is the shining star, playing with a purity rarely heard on such live recordings. She has an amazing gift, and in front of a live audience she plays the piano as if she is offering the music rather than showing it off as so many performers do. The sound quality and engineering is superior compared to most live recordings, with no obstrusive background noise, just the enthusiastic applause at the end of each cut from an audience who knew they were hearing something special.As with all of Williams' recordings, you will find something new here each time you listen, and you will go to places you never imagined music could take you."
4,A Book about Seeing!,"Because Lastmanout speaks so tenderly of what he has seen, his book encourages me to look around my own world and see the wonder there. It is a heart and eye opening book to have around and pick up when needed."
1,BEWARE it contains phenylalanine which is 50% of aspartame,I tried this for my son who has ADHD and aggressive behavior. He took it for 3 months and we did not see any results. I decided to try it myself to see if I noticed any changes and I got severe migraines. I checked the ingredients and saw it contains phenylalanine which makes up 50% of aspartame. Aspartame is known to cause migraines in many people along with many other neurological disorders. Do your research first.
3,Bob Dyalan the rapper,"This is more of a general comment. Since when did Bob Dylan rap? I think your first listening sample on the ""Hurricane"" is linked up wrong or Bob Dyaln all of a sudden became a homme."
2,A Disc of Two Halves,"This is a CD of two halves. The first seven tracks are rap or whatever. Not at all to my liking, and in time I think they will be forgotten. Track 8 is the wonderful Bob Dylan tune. This tune is not included on his 4 disc bio, which is why I bought this CD. That is followed by a great Ray Charles tune, and so on. Buy this disc if you are willing to skip the first half."
4,Great artwork but very small paper,"It was a lot smaller than I had anticipated, but worth it. I bought it for my husband, who is a very big Brom fan. The artwork is beautiful and he was very happy with it."
5,wait a long time,I love this paper. the wait was almost too long. I will use it sparingly knowing that if I want more I will have to wait 8 weeks before it will be delivered again.
3,indeed dark,"I would not personally choose this stationary again. The stationary is very S & M-ish. I gave the stationary a 3 star soley because the artwork itself is very good, detailed, unique. What I didn't like was that because it was so ""disturbed"" in nature that it limited me - a lot - to whom I could send a letter to on it - with worry of offending someone. Perhaps if I had a goth friend? Each to his own."
5,Dancing In The Storm,Dancing In The Storm is a testament of the power of the human spirit toward survival in life. Many people in like circumstances took the easy way out through sucicide. There seems to be no greater fear in this world then to face one's self and see yourself as you really are. The Author Jennifer Kilby captures the pains of her struggles and the joy of her freedom she has found in God. I highly recomended Dancing In The Storm to anyone who has lost hope in ever finding their self or their God.
1,don't waste your time,"First, the author hops from one subject to another without really coming to a meaningful conclusion.Second, it is obvious even to me, a non expert in this stuff that at least some of it is wrong.Third, he says he's an expert but what has he done? All I could find was that he said he wrote a report for the UN but then it turned out they said he did not.So my conclusion is save your money and read something else!"
1,"In this type of book, the truth is better than even the best fiction","This book has just reached Hungary. I read it in English but you will have to forgive my writing in that language.The concern is that many facts, they are not correct. Another reviewer points out the improper conclusion about Musharraf and Bhutto. To obtain and maintain credibility, this kind of mistake cannot persist.At times I could have been reading a novel. But this book is depicted as factual. I am not sure of how to believe.The author is a frequent media focus. This does not make him correct on all fronts.Nonetheless much interesting information is in this book. It is therefore I think useful as a quick oversight of the topic of Zarqawi and his organisation in Iraq. For a more precise version it is the unfortuate fact that you will have to seek another source.GL"
1,Self Promotion,"This book is by a man who said he wrote a report for the United Nations. The United Nations said he gave them a report he already wrote.I get the idea he had his answer in mind when he wrote this book and made whatever facts he happened across fit this answer.This book is really pretty useless. The author is not reliable and the book reads like it was translated in about an hour. There are conspiracy websites with better information, and at least you know not to take them too seriously."
2,grave disappointment,"Despite some negative Amazon reviews, I bought this book with an open mind, hoping that it would illuminate Zarqawi's shadowy background. However, there are such glaring - and embarrassing - factual errors that one has to doubt the veracity of any new information the author presents. For example, on page 65, the author writes that in October 1999, Pakistani General Pervez Musharraf overthrew Benazir Bhutto's government. In fact, Musharraf deposed Bhutto's main political rival, Nawaz Sharif - since Bhutto was out of power after Sharif's party defeated hers in a 1997 election. How can the author be trusted to write authoritatively on anything involving Pakistan, Afghanistan, etc. if he can't get the simplest stuff straight?"
1,Is the Author Credible?,"There are two schools of thought on Mr. Brisard. One is that he is a great expert on this topic and the other is that he fabricates what he wants to make a good story.I have found this link,portal.nasstar.com/75/files/DS%20IBC%20Notes.pdf, to a scholarly publication and it details successful libel actions against Mr. Brisard.It would seem to me that he should be able to back up what he says.This book is fascinating but after reading about his libel losses I started to think that maybe he just sat around for a couple of days making things up and doing a few google searches.I have donated my copy of this book to the local thrift store."
1,This would have made a great novel,"I think Brisard should try his hand at spy thrillers. There is a market for them and they don't have to be true.Brisard has a problem with truth. He gets facts wrong and pushes his own agendas. I've read about the libel actions but this book sure shows why he has problems, he just can't deal with the idea of getting facts and presenting them clearly.I read his other book and this is more of the same, cut and paste with a bit of wild commentary thrown in.If he were freed from the need to even appear factual, this wild stuff would make for great novels or even films. Would be fun to see all of the terrorists conspiring with world leaders and rooms full of gold and jewels and so on. He could even throw in some sexy Russian girl spies to keep it interesting!But as a factual account of Zarqawi I have to say no way. Brisard has never met Zarqawi, apparently has never even met anyone who has met Zarqawi so where are the facts?"
1,Nothing New Under the Sun!!,"Ever since 911 we have had to pay attention to terrorism. Not long after 911 everyone, including me, got to know the name Jean Charles Brisard. I was so happy when his first book became available in English.But the truth is that Brisard is not reliable. He got sued for libel by a lot of the people he talked about in his first book and others named in the 911 case. His website is gone and the US Senate had to put up a disclaimer about his testimony.Now he's done this book on Zarqawi. I read it and kept in mind the troubles Brisard has had. I guess Zarqawi and some of these other people won't sue him otherwise I think he'd have problems. There is very little in there that is verifiable. CNN and other media sites have good profiles on Zarqawi. I suggest you read them and not take the risk of getting an idea in your head from Brisard that turns out to be libel."
4,Brisard wins French court case against Soddy al-Qaeda backers!,"Read this:http://rantburg.com/poparticle.php?ID=141800&D;=2006-02-06&HC;=1On January 26, 2006, the French Court of Appeal confirmed an earlier judgment lifting preliminary measures to enforce a UK default judgment obtained by KBM against me. The legality of the UK judgment is currently challenged. The Court of Appeal condemned Khalid Bin Mahfouz to pay expenses and fees in connection to this action, and ordered Bin Mahfouz to pay me a compensation (Appeal_JCB_KBM_012606.pdf). It is the first time since he started his ruthless campaign to harass and intimidate experts, journalists and authors writing or reporting on him, that Bin Mahfouz is condemned to pay a financial compensation."
5,Must read,"The first biography of the man who leads Iraq's bloody insurgency, is a dense, detailed chronicle of the insurgent's evolution from his teenage years as a street thug. A must read in these times. Entire chapters of ""Zarqawi"" read like an inquest produced for White House lawyers, but Brisard certainly succeeds in showing that Zarqawi is the central cog -- even more than bin Laden -- in fomenting continuous violence against U.S. targets (and those who support U.S. aims)."
4,Fans of Dean Koontz and Stephen King will enjoy this book!,"Sly humour and sophisticated plotting in this twisty tale that continues to surprise as it entertains. Set in London, this gothic thriller will lead you back and forth in time as the evil Maxwell Raleigh detours fate for those unfortunate enough to enter his realm. Snappy dialogue with nail-biting suspense will keep the reader entranced to the end and wishing for more."
3,"Okay, but......","Nothing wrong with the performances here, Bing and Fred not at their 1930's ""best"", but exhibiting the savvy and know-how that is delightful to hear. yes, the arrangements are a little dated in a ""70's"" sort of way, but it was recorded in 1975, so what do you expect? My biggest complaint is simply that I hate these hatchet-job re-issues of complete works. If you want ALL the songs from the 1975 Crosby-Astaire sessions, you're better off getting Bing's box-set ""The Complete United Artists Sessions"", containing not only this complete album but all of Bing's 1975-76 work for the label. Truly, a beautiful ""last hurrah"" for one of the geniuses of the 20th century."
2,"Where are the ""clearly labeled details""?","I ordered this book sight unseen for my 22 month-old son as he loves picture word books. I am disappointed by the lack of labels in the illustrations! My son loves all kinds of trucks but to be honest I can't tell the difference between a back hoe and a dump truck. This book won't tell me either, so it is hard for me to use the book as a teaching tool. I was also disappointed by the section on teaching colors as I find it difficult to find good examples of ""true"" color on these pages. The illustration is a southwestern desert scene with what almost looks like psychedelic colors(turquoises, fuschias and teal greens). I was trying to decide between buying this book or the Richard Scarry's Biggest Word Book Ever, and I obviously made the wrong decision!"
4,Fun book for toddlers on up,"Richly illustrated, stimulating and just plain fun, this Sesame Street book is an excellent choice for toddlers through 1st or 2nd grade. My 22 month old loves ""The count"" and ""Big Bird."" I love books like this: he can grow into the book and appreciate its richly detailed illustrations more as he grows older."
5,The Apache Kid,"Wonderful book. This is an interesting overview of a specific area of Apacheria. This is a very informative book about a man who declared war on three nations, alone, the Apache, the Mexicans, and the Americans. A must read."
4,Good Popular-Press Commentary,"This is valuable as a popular-press commentary for teachers and youth leaders to use when preparing their lessons/talks. This is not for the serious theology student as it is not an academic/scholarly commentary. I have had an electronic version of this for years, but I finally broke down and purchased a physical copy."
4,lily a flower,I really enjoy this book; The Teacher's commentary and I will recommendit to all teacher's of God's word along with his word.
5,Simply an Excellent Book,"This an interesting and great book for beginners on programming. Unlike other computer books, this book is more similar to a textbook with exercises and answers at the back of the book for practising and reviewing. An invaluable asset. So if you can follow the instructions of the writer and go through from page to page, you should have get a very good glimpse of programming."
2,Well....,"Good news is shipping was super fast and easy. No problems with the seller. BUT the product is super super cheaply made. Think loose strings, uneven tassels, and a big blob of glue on top barely holding the ball thingie on. I mean, I didn't really expect much for 3.99 and I'm basically gonna use it once and toss it so I feel pretty good about its disposability. So don't expect much and you won't be disappointed."
5,One of three the best!,"This CD is one of three the best Chet's last rerordings - including ""The Last Great Concert""-2CD and ""Chet Baker In Tokyo""-2CD. A truly masterpiece! I have about 20 recordings of Chet and these one with the beautifuly sounded German DNR Big Band is the most wonderful! A pure jazz!"
2,Some good ideas you won't find elsewhere,"The author has some good ideas, but I think you have to be in an environment where a strong testing function is supported to get the most out of them. I like that the author has strong opinions that he shares. Often, too many authors are trying not to offend people, or are trying to sell some silver bullet, and they make no points worth making. These opinions are where the title flows from I think.In my experience, my environment didn't support the quality gates that are part of the author's process. This is where I had a hard time applying it to my projects."
3,Nothing interesting,The book introduces broad range of concepts and algorithms . Sparse in code. You will not learn anything from this book - best to avoid.
1,This is a horrible book. Failed all my expectations.,"This is book is basically a collection of a few well know algorithms, with most of its pages printed with online judge problems (without analysis nor solutions). Any decent book on algorithms or programming is better than this one!"
5,excellent programming manual,"It is well known that programming is more of an art than a science. The best way to obtain proficiency in this subject is to try your hand at constructing algorithms for many different problems, and the present book suits this objective admirably. The problems, coming as they do from several programming contests, are very varied, challenging and often humorous. A very important feature concerning this book is that after obtaining a tentative solution, one can try its correctness and efficiency by submitting the program to a web page, where a checking robot will analyze it automatically. The book is very reasonably priced and undoubtely it will belong in the library of every scientific programmer."
1,disaster,"the only attractive aspect of this book is its website where you can submit your solutions in order to check them. However their website keeps giving errors. I spent enormous amount of time to be able to only register one of the sites given in the book and I could not register. Hello! What do you want me to do with this book now?The book is about programming and its website is giving errors. Now, are these authors credible enough? Plus, book is full of typos."
4,Outstanding Work!!!,"I completely agree with Mr. Shahriar Manzoor who has been selected the Judge of the World Finals 2003 & 2004 for his significant contribution in programming contest activities. He is also the System Administrator of ACM UVa Online Judge of Professor Miguel Revilla and a contributor in this book. You can find several contest problems in this book written by Mr. Shahriar Manzoor. Contestants in Bangladesh are getting profound interest in this book. Students were eagerly waiting for this book and the solution techniques provided are helping them greatly in solving many problems that they were not being able to solve. This is a great help!![N. B: Sumit (Mr. Shahriar Manzoor) once told me that if he had to choose a second profession, he would have selected cover-designing.]-- Tanbir Ahmed"
1,not the good at all if you start in competitions,"This books is simply weak. There are informal and formal books and sources you can start play in these contests. TopCoder is certainly the best one, ACM-ICPC is the most official one, and acm.uva.es, involving one of the authors of this book, is also an excellent source. But this book is simple useless."
4,This may not be what you are looking for.,"This is a book about problems in programming contests but I feel it isalso a introduction to algorithms. An introduction that makes you workout for yourself things that you might expect to have explained to youin a textbook. There are two approaches for preparing yourself as acompetitive programmer. One approach involves learning lots of relevantsmall skills. Later with practice and ability you may be able to putthose skills together in truely creative ways. The other approachinvolves learning some general principles and then practicing problemswhich apply those principles in more (or less!) obvious ways. I havealways preferred the second approach, especially when it done withproblems whose solutions are less obvious. Solving such problems forcesyou to practice what you need need to be a creative problem solver. Theauthors of this book seem to agree with me. You may not like that. I, ofcourse, do."
1,Two turned out in-effective! Collapses under hose weight,"Just put a 25 foot hose on these.... when filled with water and resting on the holder... it, they, just collapse.Installed with the three screws and substantial washers... just caved in around them.Logic might be you have to take all the hose off before filling... just seems counterproductive!"
1,Price Way too High,If Amazon will lower the price by tomorrow I'll order one.However Home Depot has this model for $3.49.I just checked.Come on Amazon. I'd prefer to buy from you.---
5,Hold my hose well,This is what it is...I have it holding about 150 feet of hose and it does a good job! the plastic seems tough enough to last.
5,It's really cool!,Bubblegum Crisis is really cool. The futuristic neo-punk setting is unique and the characters are awesome. This was one of the first anime I ever bought and now almost 200 series purchases later I have to say it's still a favorite. This anime is timeless. I've probably watched it through 50 times or so and it never gets old. There's nothing stopping you from buying and loving this show so go for it. You'll really like it.
5,amazing series,"one of the best anime of all time, its has great adventure and comedy..I would highly recommend this series to anyone."
5,Big hit with my daughter & her friends,"My grand daughter likes anime and anything animated which sort of figures since she loves to draw. She usually only watches a little anime with my son & I because most of the stories are focused on male characters. The only exception that she would watch several episodes of in a row has been Ghost in The Shell, until now. Several friends told me that Bubblegum Crisis was popular and focused on female characters so I got it for my grand daughter as a Christmas gift. She thinks the series is great, loves the characters, and has watched the whole series through twice already. Well worth the price as a solid entertainment value for your family anime fans in spite of somewhat predictible story lines."
4,Good Show.,"I really liked this anime and suggest it as an addition to any collection. It's full of action and has a fairly good ending. The only thing that brothered me is just hard for me to define. Something just left me flat. I enjoyed watching it, but I just didn't see it as 5 stars."
5,Reads like a good mystery!,"I have read previous works from Dr. Croswell, and found this to be the best yet. There is enough background info on the characters, their lives, and the chronological order of the research, to keep you riveted, but not so much that the lay reader becomes scared of the subject. I think the greatest aspect of this book is that my thirteen year old daughter read it, and it has given her the impetus to explore many of these aspects of the science in greater detail. What more could you ask for?"
5,Unbelievable!!!,"It simply makes no sense! Ledisi has done it again. Her debut ""Soulsinger"" was amazing and this one is coming at you fully loaded. Her voice is in incerdible shape and the song selection is perfect. I have been waiting for this one and I was not disappointed. Track for track, Ledisi immerses her soul and takes you on a joyous musical journey. ""Autumn Leaves"" is simply classic and her delivery is sheer magic. I thought I was gonna explode on that one. ""Sugar Brown Sugar"", ""Feeling Orange But Sometimes Blue"", ""Round Midnight"" and ""Straight No Chaser"" are all brilliant. There is no song on this CD that is lacking. The musicianship is excellent and all the vocals are shining. Don't miss out on this one. Jazzy R&B at it's best!!!"
5,Awesome and Fresh,"Ledisi is the BEST new young singer I have heard in years! The title tune was worth me buyying BOTH of her albums without hearing anything else- And not only was I not dissappointed, I was BLOWN AWAY! The girl has chops and writes. Plus, along with her partner ""Sun"", writes REAL music. She doesn't fall into the sample group of Angie Stone and has much better more diverse music than Alicia Keys. If you want real singing and music- Check her out!"
2,Do Not Put in Dishwasher,"I wavered on giving this one or two stars. Although the ice cream scoop works very well and is cute, all the finish came off the first time it was washed in the dishwasher. The scoop looks like it is made of stainless steel, but it must be made of something else. We had to throw it away because without the finish it did not seem safe for food--it left black powder on everything it touched. Very sad that we only got to use the scoop twice and would not recommend it. (Note that I did not read whether the product was dishwasher safe or not--but since it appears to be made of metal I assume most people would do like I did and throw it in the dishwasher regardless of what the directions say.)"
5,Great Show,What can be said about Cheers that has not already been said. It is one of the best sitcoms of all time. You really feel like you are one of the gang when you watch the show and you care about the characters. Do yourself a favor and pick up the seasons while they are available.
2,"Great Series, mediocre picture quality","While Cheers is one of my favorite series and I would have bought this season anyway to have the whole series (when it is complete), I have started to notice the picture quality issues one prior reviewer noted. While I have not watched the whole season yet to know how often it happens, the picture quality changes are very noticeable and do take away from the enjoyment of the episodes impacted. I have no idea why this would happen but it looks like they did a poor quality splice to reinsert certain footage. Buyer beware"
4,The remarks about poor picture quality are all TRUE,"Great series - great season! But there are some REAL inconsistencies in picture quality in several episodes... to the point where it should be pointed out on the cover art as an alert to the buyer! I love this show, and it's only a problem in a few episodes, so I will overlook it, but those interested in buying should know this. It's been about 8 years since I posted an Amazon review, so consider that as well."
5,Party time,Great for parties and relatively inexpensive. Nice to stack in the dishwasher when the party is over. Color goes with everything. Use a colorful napkin and enjoy!
5,The Perfect Solution,"We were looking for plates that would go with any decor, hold up well, dishwasher and microwave safe, and not feel cheap or lightweight. These were the answer for us. We've been using them for about a month, not a single chip or concern related to them. Highly recommend!"
1,These plates are not good quality and they break!,"I purchased this brand of drinking glasses and plates for my two younger children ages 3 and 6. We were excited at first. But after a few times through the dishwasher we noticed the glasses and plates started to look a little melted or warped. Then it happened...my three year old dropped one of the drinking glasses and it broke!I simply don't recommend these products at all because for one they are not dishwasher safe, two they are not made of all glass, and lastly they are not child/breakable proof"
4,Useful reference book for those intereste in the early medieval history of the Eastern Europ,"Author is well known and highly reputable specialist on the the early medieval Eastern Europe, and various turcic nomads, who shaped to the large extend the history of this region. The present issue is a collection of the articles published by author in various academic journals and compendiums on the subject. Unfortunately publisher had chosen not to reset the text, but used photocopies of the articles, which looks rather shoddy for the book at this price. Book would be of interest for specialists, students, and amateurs interested in the history of the Black Sea-Caspian steppe region, and interaction of the turcic nomads with thier nieghbours: Eastern Slavs, Byzantium, etc."
2,"For this bag, you get get what you pay for","Not a bad bag, but not good either.It doesn't have any small pockets for pucks or tape or anything like that and it only has one side pocket for jerseys, pants etc. After a month both of the zippers to the main flap came off, which isn't hard to get fixed at a seamstress or somewhere like that, but shows you the bag isn't that well made. The pad straps aren't long enough to hold the pads onto the top of the bag.On the other hand the bag has plenty of space, and the materials have held up just fine."
1,Low Budget and Ridiculous,"This DVD is garbage. All due respect to Robin Downes, but the production of this video is very poor and it was not done well. I've taken one of Robin's classes and this video does not capture the technical aspects nor the spirit of her instruction. She looks like she was coerced into doing the video and unfortunately that is reflected in the performance. Trust me, you absolutely don't want to buy this DVD."
1,No lessons in the book,"The book is described as ""Lessons with......"". I really didn't find any AiKiDo lessons. A lot of (good) photos of the Master - yes, but not a single lesson explained. Not even close to what I expected. Planned to return the book, only to find that it cost more in postage (international) than the cost of the book itself...."
5,AWSOME BOOK.. LOVED EVERY WORD,"I really enjoyed this book. To me, it placed right along side Frank Peretti and Ted Dekkar. It had me from the character description in the begining of the book. Every character came alive. I researched and found out this is the only book he had published, and disappointed to find out that no other books in this series are in the works. I was ready to buy every book in the series had they been published. I loved it!!"
5,This book is a star,"A gorgeous book of popular nursery rhymes with the real star being the illustrations.Each double page features photographs of an animal set against a brightly painted background.My 1 year old son loved this book so much that we had to borrow it six consecutive times from our local library.From admiring this book he now oinks, barks, quacks and baa's - but we are still having troubles mastering the sound of a koala!A lovely addition to any child's library - we are eagerly awaiting the reprint."
3,Don't get burned,"They are ok, nothing special. Holding a 425 degree pan for 10 seconds and you will feel the heat, especially if part of the grip of the pan is away from the ribbed surfaces of the glove.They are good for short term, a few seconds of high heat contact."
5,Our boys love this!,"Learning Curve V_BOT: The Radio Control Transforming Car To RobotSanta brought this for our 7 year old son this year and it is a huge hit! We also have a 2 year old that loves it too! We have been very careful with this toy (since it is so expensive) and only let the boys play with it under adult supervision. So far, so good, the V Bot is transforming back and forth between robot and vehicle when allowed enough space to transform. I'm glad that Santa brought it! The boys show it off every time someone new comes over. In my opinion, this is a toy that you have to be very careful with, but well worth it!"
2,V-Bot,As long as you realise that this is a transforming Robot and that it works better in Robot mode than in car mode then it is a cool toy but although this was my 9 year olds must have toy he really got more fun and spent more time with the havoc heli than with the V Bot. The V Bot in Robot mode moves quickly and reacts better to the remote but in car mode is sluggish and does not react when turned left or right to anyone who is used to RC cars this is very frustrating.
5,Very Cool Toy!,"I purchased this toy for my 7-year-old son. He absolutely loves it! The V BOT is very durable and easy to operate. I was concerned about the condition of the outer shipping box after the U.S. Mail got through with it, but the V BOT was very securely attached within it's box (freeing him takes time and patience with all the screws and wires)."
1,Don't buy will disappoint,"Bought this toy for 9 year old, it was his ""just have to have"" christmas gift. It was sooooo cool when we pulled it out of the box, looks really cool then we played with it. Sucks, all it wanted to do is transform, difficult to control, some of the plastic parts get stuck when it transforms causing terrible noises. Now I have a kid that ""hates it"" and just wants to return it to the store for ""something else"". CAUTION- save your money and buy something else perhaps Havoc Heli."
1,I would be careful,"""Santa"" brought this toy to my son. It comes in package as robot and then transforms into car. Our transformed into a car (one time) and now wont change back into a robot. Called 1-800 number and they said I should probably send it back to the store for a fast replacement. I think I will just ask for a refund and move on. Anything with that moving parts is bound to be trouble."
3,"Fun, but hard to use and program","I bought this for my 12 year-old son. He loved the robot, but making it work to the level of promise in the marketing material was hard for him. The programming was difficult. It worked and transformed as promised. Just a little too complicated."
2,fun while it lasted,"My son got this for Christmas, and while it was really neat and did everything it was supposed to, it was probably only used 1 hr total before one of the main drive motors failed and now it will only turn in circles when in robot mode. I guess we'll try and persue some kind of replacement or repair, but I'm not too hopeful about getting anything done now as it is past 30 days since purchase."
3,V-Bot Transformer,"Cool toy and works as advertised. A bit overpriced, but still a very good toy. Robot could do more but the radio control car is a blast. The MP3 feature is a very nice touch"
2,breaks easily!,"This is a VERY fun toy that starts to break fairly fast. The front grill snapped off the first day, and it was down hill from there. We opted to return it for a refund."
2,No Big Deal!,"Sort of cool what it does.After you've seen it half a dozen times it's an expensive remote car. No big deal,good promo job though!"
2,be weary,I have an 8 year old son that requested this toy and only this toy for x-mas after searching everywhere for it finally purchased it. After opening and putting batteries in we had a blast with it. It only worked for about 1 hour and it transformed back into a car and started clicking. It will not do anything else. You turn it on and it clicks. We have a very upset boy. I think that the company needs to improve the product. Be weary about this toy. I know how it made me feel when my little one was devistated.
4,My VBOT experience,"Now that transformers is back in, my 6 year old wanted this toy - at the top of list - worked well out of the box but after only a half dozen times - the front grill made a horrible sound and snapped. Very cool toy just may need to be built a little more durable. We will get replacement and try again."
4,Great,"My 10 year old son has a lot of remote control toys, so I wasn't sure he would like this.....but he loved it. He loved the fact it could change from a car to a robot just by pressing a button."
5,"A Heart So Wild is a masterpiece,I love Johanna Lindsey !!!!","The book is splendid,it has a good setting and I always love a good hard male character!!!! And Courtney is not Ms.helpless herself and I like that too.I really wished that the book we go on longer after Chandos declared his love for Courtney but I would never presume to change anything of Mrs.lindsey's. I enjoy all of her books !!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
5,Another good story,I have been reading Johanna Lidseys' books since the 1970's. She always writes a good story and this one was no exception. I would recommend this book to anyone who loves a good romance novel.
4,good read,"I love all of Johanna Lindsey books, in my opinion this isn't her greatest work but it's still worth the read"
1,Fantasy. Not so much,I have never written a book review before but after finishing just the first two chapters of this book I was disgusted enough to tell others. I have been a huge fan of Johanna for the longest time and have read many of her books. I like the escape the books can give while being read. Were is the fantasy and escape when within the second chapter you read the same horrible stuff that is heard on the news. A 10 year old REALLY .....Regardless of the rav reviews I don't think I will be finishing the book.
3,three stars for sticking power,"Here's a blast from the past for me. My tastes have changed somewhat over the years so it's been a while since I've read this but I still remember discussing this one with my friend and how I told her I thought it was good but she was so annoyed with the whole ""White Wing"" thing which struck me as enormously funny."
1,Weak and Fragile!,"The tubes arrived in a timely manner, but were not what I was expecting. I expected tubes for coin storage similar to those that I already have, but these are cheap and weak as opposed to strong and sturdy. The lid barely attaches firmly to the container and is not very snug as it just slips and slips instead of tightening."
5,A fortunate life,This is the second time I have read this book as it was still on my mind from some ten years before. A remarkable man and his incredible life.
5,"wonderful, unembellished book","a fascinating account of life in Australia over the turn of the last century, unembellished by an emotional adjectives. A fabulous read"
4,Such a good story,"Interesting life, a good description of battlers in Australia from before the first world war. The writing is somewhat stilted. And what a memory that man had. How brave, how admirable."
3,Just okay,"Recommended for those over 65 or those interested in the life-style in Australia before, during, and after WW1. Good light reading."
3,"Nice, but a little too simple",I started this book with expectations and initially enjoyed the story but as I progressed the overly optimistic spin on what was often horrendous occurences and the over simplifying of major life events grated on me. I would still recommend the book but certainly not for elegant or clever writing but for the story alone.
5,remarkable,"This is Facey's life story, a remarkable autobiography of growing up in Australia around the turn of the century and striving against the odds. Facey is not an author and never intended to publish his journal. At the end of his life, he simply wrote it all down. Orphaned, illiterate, and impoverished, his story is one of sheer determination and strength of character with never a drop of self-pity. Grit, drama, history, a sense of place and time, and the upward reach of one man's struggle, beautifully told."
4,Easy to read view of life early this century in Australia.,The author was illiterate to a late age which makes this a easy book to read but facinating.
5,Highly Recommended,A most pleasant listening experience. I like every song on this album. It has a complex sound with many instruments the way I like it.
4,"Hard to find a series that stacks up to Record of Lodoss War, but this fits the bill!",My family whom are very particular as to what makes quality anime have all given this the thumbs up. Will definitely consider purchasing the second part as a result.
2,Slow to arrive. Hardware not included.,"This forged bracket is acceptable and as it appears in the photo. However, the holes for the screws are not aligned; they are offset. Additionally, the product did not come with screws. You will have to supply your own screws. A different forged bracket I ordered from Amazon (for about the same price) came with screws and was perfectly aligned. The bracket took approximately a little less than 3 weeks to arrive. I thought the shipping time was excessive."
5,Sound of the Future!!!,This CD is great!!. I like the beautiful sound of the trumpet and the hot rhythm section here in this CD. All the tracks are very Cool!!!. I will recomend this CD to everybody.
2,Slade Slayed,"Must admit that this album delivers less kick the second time around. this album used to get my heart pumping when I first listened to it, but it no longer has that same drive and energy that were Slades' trademark. Still got a buzz out of Gypsy Roadhog though!!!"
1,NINTENDO DS LITE AC & DC POWER KIT,"DIDN'T REALLY NEED THIS, BOUGHT BFORE RECEIVING DS LITE. SYSTEM COMES WITH A CHARGER. OK IF YOU WANT TO CHARGE IN YOUR Car, I HAVE YET TO OPEN THIS PACKAGE."
2,Easy but not long lasting,"I bought this product about 4 years ago. I'm not a handy person, and it is a breeze to install. It worked very well for a couple of years, and now I'm going to have to replace it. The water adjustment knob no longer works. The water keeps filling and going down the overflow pipe, so it is running all of the time. Since having this problem,I have been able to get it to adjust to a very low level a few times. Each of those times I had to readjust it about 20-30 times or more to get it to the low level. It would work for a few months and then start running again. Every time I have readjusted it, it has worked for a shorter amount of time. The last time I got it working, it lasted about 3 weeks. It is easy to replace and cheap, so if you don't mind that it doesn't work for more than two-three years it is OK."
4,Great Value - Keeps Near Perfect Time - Easy on the eyes,"I love simple, clean watches. That means big numbers, a leather strap, good contrast between hands and dial. And this watch has it all. It's got a good size too - another of the 40MM chunks so popular today. Mine keeps great time - gaining a second every few days - much better than any of my mechanical watches (as you would expect). The hands and numbers glow well enough for me to read the time at night on my nightstand but it's not as bright as some others I have. I think the style is really sharp and in the looks department, it holds its own against watches costing much, much more. The contrasting stitching on the strap is really nice given the low price. (This watch cost less than half of the sales tax on my IWC Mark XV.) The only reason for 4 stars instead of 5 is the lack of a date."
2,Coke v. Pepsi,"If you want to know the history of the cola wars, then here it is. This explores the origins of Coke and Pepsi and how their rivalry was inflamed. The work was front-loaded; there was more discussion about the origins than about taste challenges and other modern occurrences.The selection of interviewees was small and very homogenous. Though one sees people of all races, ages, and genders drinking the sodas, all the interviewees were older, white men. Moreover, there were product placements galore. For example, one man didn't just discuss Coke; he wore a Coke tie and there was a huge Coke symbol a few feet behind him.Personally, I still like Pepsi better; it's smoother and not as bubbly. While I wanted to eat candy after watching a candy documentary, this documentary did not make me want to run out and buy any more soda than I normally consume."
4,"small, functional, great solution for your GPS needs","I will say this device performs just as advertised. easy to connect to any Bluetooth device, very user friendly and provides very reliable position updates. WAAS enabled for very accurate mesurements. i would buy this one again!"
5,very happy,"The product is great, as described on advertising, im very happy with the stethoscope, i recomend this product to everyone who whants quality on medical care"
1,Review,It was a lot more harsh and not really what we thought it would be per the description. We wouldn't recommend it.
1,Eh,Pretty badly done.Very boring. I don't even think I got half way through. I need 5 more words to be done.
4,Great CD,"This CD is good. This CD includes some of today's big hits like ""Better Off Alone"" by Alice Deejay"", ""I Try"" by Macy Gray, ""Waiting For Tonight"" by Jennifer Lopez, and ""Blue(Da Ba Dee) by Eiffel 65. I recommend this CD highly."
3,Good; but too sweet,"I have shared this with friends, and we all agree it is too sweet; but, we say we like it anyway. The apple doesn't come across nearly as much as the strawberry, which can be overwhelming."
4,Strawberries? Blue strawberries that are round?,"This may be my own unique experience but I didn't have any strawberries in my cereal although I did find a few blueberry (freeze dried)pieces. And while I don't care enough to complain to Amazon, I may register a minor complaint with the company since this is a sign of poor quality control. Otherwise, I am enjoying the product. It's a mild blueberry flavor which complements the apples nicely. My guess is that the strawberry favor might be similarly mild but who knows? Though I have yet to open all the bags, a quick scan suggests that blueberries may be all I find even though they are all labeled ""strawberry""."
3,Mediocre product,"Great price! The quality was of the product was good, but the strawberries added an undesirable flavor."
3,Deeply Flawed but Entertaining--Where was the Editor??,"I did not notice most of the errors mentioned by other reviewers, but toward the end of the book I became conscious of mistakes like the repeated misspelling of Beale St.(""Beal""), ""J.Giles"" for J.Geils, and the claim that the Who were touring behind ""Who's Next"" as their current album in 1977! The writing is breezy and conversational (almost to a fault)and apparently there was no fact checking done at all: was Cohen his own editor? This is a colorful and informal conversational essay that reads like a very long Rolling Stone piece. You will enjoy the many anecdotes, but be aware that the author plays fast and loose with the facts."
1,Tons of innacuracies.,"Just looking throught the pictures he shows a picture of phill chess with the muddy waters band, including muddy, pointing out little walter but not even naming bo diddley who is pictured. this wasn't a band. the three of them made a lp called super blues. mis quoted lyrics and stories that are backwards or sideways fill up the book. rich cohen does point out some interesting facts/points about the chess label being sold and for those points alone i would recommend the book,,,just buy it as cheaply as you can."
1,"Tries to write poetry, succeeds in slobbering","What looks like a history of Chess records is a bloated, unwieldy tome that deeply disappoints. While you hope to hear about Muddy Waters, Bo Diddley and other Chess greats, you get Cohen's slobbering rambling.Here's a typical sentence (speaking of a piece of art in the Metropolitan Museum, surely a necessary comparison for a book about a roots-oriented blues-and-rock record label in Chicago): ""This man, as Avedon portrays him, is rough and angry, unsociable, clear-eyed, ancient and folkloric, a relic from another age, genetically no different than those who came later, yet touched by the residue of a great evil."" HUH?Fully half of the book is history of Chicago going as far back as the Civil War. This is a startlingly bad history that pretends to be about records and instead is a palette for palaver."
3,Record Men and Machers and Rockers are the same book!,"I recently purchased Rich Cohen's 'The Record Men' and 'Machers and Rockers', which are presented as two separate books on the subject of Chess Records, i.e. the descriptions are completely different. In actuality, the only difference is 'The Record Men' is a paperback, and 'Machers and Rockers' is hardcover. Otherwise, the chapter titles and text throughout are exactly the same. Amazon also offers a discount for purchasing these titles together, which is highly misleading. If Mr. Cohen didn't have enough material or insight on Chess Records to write two separate books with separate content, he should have written one book, and included better pictures and more extensive historical information. Buyer beware!"
3,"not the strongest masterbeat set, but still some standouts","This disc starts off with a bang-literally. Bang On is followed by a series of diva vocal anthems all the way up to Real Love! There are a couple of mostly instrumental tracks that I'm not crazy about, and have that ""filler"" feel, which is surprising for a Masterbeat collection. But it's back to the vocal for Loneliness and ghetto. Instant Moments is another repetitive instrumental, but Ligaya ends the disc on a high. Instrumental yes, but it's a gorgeous trance tune. Track times:1. bang on (8:52)2. seduce me (5:53)3. Serious (10:49)4. Real love (6:36)5. I am ready (6:53)6. free your elephants (7:37)7. Loneliness (6:23)8. Ghetto (5:54)9. Instant Moments (6:15)10. Ligaya (8:12)"
1,Did not fit,"This charger did not fit the Nokia cellphone as advertised. Not worth the trouble of returning, so I threw it out."
5,Nice warm fuzzy.,"We also read A Brush with Darkness and felt this too is an inspirational book and ideal for an open discussion for children. This is a great book about boundries, about our ultimate purpose in life, about friendship and change. A marvelous artist tells a story that should be a lesson to all of us."
2,Not my favorite.,"I don't know, but there was something about this story that just didn't appeal to me and get me excited to read it to my daughter. First of all, I don't care for the word ""stupid"" at the beginning of it. I understand the message that the author is trying to portray, but I don't feel that they did a good job getting their point across. There are better books out there for kids that contain a stronger, more obvious message."
5,great book for kids and adults,i purchased this book for church use and to help my son gain confidence in himself. We read it together the day it came I felt it gave us both insight into not being so independent and to reach out to others not everyone is going to hurt you. That God did make each of us for a purpose and only he knows what it is. That life is ups and downs we have to get right back up and live.
5,Took a chance and I won.,This is a great band in my opinion. They do good hard blues rock. If that's your thing I recommend this.
2,"Mel's Voice is Great, but the material is pure schmaltz","These songs and arrangements are pretty bad, even though Mel's voice is beautiful. This disc would be better titled ""Mel Torme: My LEAST Favorite Songs"". Mel hated recording this stuff but was pressured by Capitol records who, during the 60's, tried to capitalize on the rock craze by having older artists record modern rock songs in an elevator music style to appeal to the parents. I'd pass on this one...it's one of those cd that you would never want one of your friends to catch you listening to.The only redeeming cut is Mel's cover of ""Happy Together"" which is done in a bouncy, swinging, upbeat style. The rest of the tunes are either drippy or awkward sounding."
5,Instruction is incredible,This DVD is the best money I've spent on twirling -- even better than live lessons. The first DVD is cool to watch but the second one will provide hours and hours of practice assistance. I highly recommend it.
5,Speaking her faith in song,"Máire Brennan, lead vocalist for the long time Celtic ProgRock/New Age group, Clannad and older sister to Enya has come out of her closet, so to speak with this Word/Epic Records release. The tunes are wonderful and speak softly of her faith in God. While some hard-line Christians would say the CD is too secular and some pagans would find it too religious in content, the songs are merely vehicles that showcase her superb vocal talents and the fact that she believes in a higher power. Several of the songs are pure Gaelic and amazing to hear the children speaking in their native tongue. By far, the best selection, as for sounding like a Clannad tune is the opening track, ""Follow The Word"". The remainder of the CD is light and airy and every bit as enjoyable as her other solo efforts."
1,Poorly made machete,"this is a very poorly made machete. its thick, feels as if it will fall apart at any moment, cant hold an edge, and it bends like mild steel. the handles are very cheesy. one little whack and the blade bends like crazy. Theyre also about as dull as a butter knife. these are made in china. I have definitely seen better made machetes. I dont think i will ever buy from seymour again. I would recommend tramontina for a machete. Ive had one of theirs for almost 8 years now and its been the best machete ive ever had."
2,Hollow,The plot is hollow and the love story to boot. The story has too many flaws. How - and this is not a spoiler- can a man go inside an airplane and nobody is the wiser? No matter that this story is from the 80's even there were security measures inside the airport and whithin the tarmac. Like this flaw are others that if I tell you could be a spoiler.
1,wrong item sent,I cannot provide a review of this product as the incorrect item was sent to me. I cancelled the order and returned the incorrect item.
4,no problems for over year,"When i bought my HP desktop, i got this as part of the deal from HP. I use the device now to store all my picture and music files. it has no on/off switch and thus always remains on. it has been working flawlessly for over a year now. No complaints."
5,A Great HP Media Center Addition,"Found this to be a great HP Media Center accessory addition as well as a stand alone USB back up hard drive. I removed the 160 GB Drive and upgraded to a 1 TB Seagate Drive. Sweet move, as I eliminated the use of 4 IDE drives in various GB arrays."
3,Minor issue,"This accessory works exactly as expected. However, when the AC adapter is attached tp the back of the dock, it keeps detaching when you place the nintendo in or take it out."
4,Good Pulp Fiction,"This is the best of a series of three Novels released after the Mask of Zorro movie in 1998 (the Jaguar Warriors and The Dragon Riders were the other two). This one has all the makings of the best Pulp fiction novels, it is fast paced, action packed and has an element of mystery to boot. If you liked the movie, or are a fan of the old Zorro novels by Johnston McCully, then this is for you! A blockbuster movie in book form. It's a shame Tor/Forge books didn't continue the series."
3,Introduction to Statistics,"The tape is a basic introduction to statitics with information covering: data definition, mean, median, and plot box. The best segment was that covering the plot box. The tape is very good for an introduciton but you will need more advanced tapes if you are at university level."
4,"Good Value, But I Cut It Out","My trainer recommended this to me and I don't have any complaints with the product I received being of low quality. But the fact is the benefits can't really be measured. I cut my routine down to a calcium supplement, Iron Cap and multi-vitamin. I don't see the need for more than that."
2,Disappointment,"I've liked most of James Hall's other books but found this one a disappointment. I realize reading any novel requires a certain suspension of disbelief but this one was just too much. For one thing, the protagonist could have easily been overtaken much earlier in the novel. I found myself thinking ""come on!"" as he's allowed to continue on with his scheme. I also found many of the characters poorly drawn and totally inconsistent in their actions."
2,Buzz Cut,"I've read two other James Hall books, Mean High Tide and Hard Aground. If you can get past his often over-the-top and always moronic PC blabber, they are generally entertaining reads. That is not rue of Buzz Cut though. The plot is completely ridiculous, and the actions that the characters in this story don't take are just plain stupid. I was very disappointed.I have one more of Hall's books to read, but if it is anything like Buzz Cut, I think I will just put it down and find another author to read."
3,Huge Fan of Hall,I have read almost everything Hall has written. I am a huge fan. Compare him alot to Elmore Leonard. Having said that this plot ending was a little bit garbled. Probably one of my least favorites so far
3,Not exactly as pictured.,"This is an adorable umbrella... actually it's really more of a parasol, since it's not very rugged, and the picture shows the bat pattern as printed in black, when it is in fact navy. I'm still fairly happy with my purchase, though for $65 dollars each, they could at least show what color it actually is."
4,Great for bikini line,"I heard from some girlfriends that Magic Powder was great for removing hair in the bikini area. Its pretty cheap compared to other hair removal creams, and a heck of a lot less painful than waxing. The only con, and its a big con, is the smell of the product. Its like rotten eggs and it lingers, so be sure to use it way ahead of any time spent around other people. Its messy to clean up as well. But, it does what it says it will do, and very well."
2,Too long on the road,"This album didn't grab me as much as the other albums. It seemed to me like Melissa has spent too much time on the road singing about the same problems. Her songs suffer for it, they are becoming so self-referential that I have a hard time relating. A disappointment."
2,Disappointing,"Since her album of EVERYTHING I NEED Melissa's music was getting better and better, and now it seems all of her talent went into something rather self-pitying. I think her past is catching up with her in this album and holding her back from her real talent as a songwriter."
4,The Latest from Ferrick,"Once again, Melissa Ferrick manages to put out an amazing album. Great lyrics, great sound. Same sound as previous albums, so if you like her previous music, you should enjoy this cd. Not quite as good as Freedom, but still worth the $..."
5,Beautiful countryside!!,Nice and clean story. Very much like the typical Chinese movies I watched when I was a kid in China decades ago!!!Beautiful scenery. A must for the whole family. The photography is beautiful and properly exposed. A very good production.
3,"It's ok, but not perfect.","Well this is an ok device, but the spike isn't long enough to be really useful. It needs to be about 6"" or 8"" longer to really hold its footing in most applications. I had to go to the hardware store and buy a 24"" long snug-fitting piece of pipe that I drove into the ground and then put this inside it to keep it from pulling out of the ground. Once I did that, it worked well, but it would have been great if it were designed better from the beginning."
4,Plant saver,"Keeps the hose from crushing my ""baby"" plants! These stakes look inconspicuous and easily insert into the ground. The clean design and looks like the will last a long time."
3,"A nice book, but it DOES NOT teach you to design cars!","Has no lessons at all, they are interviews with designers with their opinions on contemporary, or rather 90's and early 2000's cars."
2,Definitely not for beginner ...,"I bought this book, and I find it that this book is not meant for beginner artist wishing to pursue proper car drawing insights. There's only a few pages explain about the basic infos on car drawings, but the rests of those pages are mostly about car designer's tastes of car drawings. If you're an intermediate artist, feel free to get this book. There ..."
5,The first step into car design should be made with this book in hand,"Before I bought this book I thought it would be full of tutorials, and I was wrong. actually you can get those tutorials on the web. But what suprised me was all of the great interviews with the big guys of this industry. This book really lets you know what are you going towards to, and really helps you illustrate the design process of a car, with maybe you involved, in your mind. After each reading session I felt like I have to go draw some cars, it was very inspiring.If you're looking for a car design career, then this book will help you imagine yourself inside, besides inspiring you to start this journey.Enjoy"
3,How To Design Cars Like a Pro,"Yes quite an interesting book......sadly its not quite as easy as the book says, but interesting non the less.If you want to realy know how to design cars,go to the Royal College of Art...or Coventry Poly."
4,Pretty good....,"When I first looked into this book at a bookstore, I thought it was an interesting read, but it seemed a little vague. I eventually brought it months later and I have to admit that it's actually pretty good. They nicely intergrated everything into sections, such as the history of car design, current car design leaders and drawing techniques. The whole thing looks professional and is nicely told all around. It really is a good read.One thing that did bother me, and also contributed to the 4-star rating rather than 5, was that the drawing techniques and tutorial section had been ripped off from wwwDOTcardesignnewsDOTcomIf you only want to buy the book for the drawing lesson, just head to the site I mentioned. It has the EXACT tutorials the book has, and for free!"
4,The name says it all,"If you are looking for a book about car drawing, skip this one. As the name says, its about design. There are many insights on what designers search when sketching a car, but very few tips on how to actually draw it by yourself (as it was already commented, you can find the tutorials in the internet - for free). That said, this is a very good book. It depicts the creative process behind the design, it teaches you how to see a car, and shows how some of the greatests (read Patrick Le Quement) do it themselves. It is nicely organized, with enough pictures so you won't need your imagination to understand what they are talking about. Not perfect, but surely very good. Strongly recommended.If you want to get the whole pack, design+drawing, I recommend buying this book together with ""How to draw cars like a pro"", like I did. ou won't regret doing so."
2,a disaponted purchase,I found this book very disapointing. It is not the design guide I was looking for. I cenrtainly do not recomend it.Cheers
5,Great price,Product was shipped timely and in great condition. Great price as compared to what you can get at the college bookstore or other sites.
5,Great NW Post Rock,"I got this CD back when it came out, and I still listen to it all the time. If you like Mogwai or Don Cab you will enjoy this for sure."
4,Anything by McBride is worth it!,"This is a colorful book with an interesting text, well written and carefully researched by Antony Karasulas. Much of the research seems to come from Russian and Eastern Museums, always welcome. Anything from Angus McBride is always welcome as well...a fine book."
4,An unusual subject,I liked this book because it has Angus McBride illustrations in it. The Subject itself is a bit off the beaten track of popular history but the text tries hard to do the right thing.
5,A must read!!!,"A story that will kick you off the seat your sitting on!This is a book that you can not put down,well written although it is not for the faint of heart.Character development is excellent never leaving you guessing paired with excellent plot development makes this a great and exciting story !Overall a very different style of romance writing entertaining and also heartfelt love and affection showing that love has no boundaries alive or dead!"
5,I LOVE THIS BOOK!,"This is one of the first books I read of Andrea's work back in 2006. To this day I continue to reread this novel. It is absolutely fantastic! The association of all kinds of different characters, human and otherwise, just meshes so well together. The story is actually believable which makes it all the more scary and fun! I can clearly imagine the characters and scenes. THIS SHOULD BE A MOVIE! The story is amazing as well. From the beginning you experience so many emotions from digust to joy to utter sadness. I have and will continue to recommend this book to anyone who loves horror. One of my absolute favorites!"
3,what I received was slightly different than what is pictured.,"The curtain panel pictured has 17 strands with roughly 37 shells per strand. The panel I received has 14 strands, with about 20 shells per strand. Since I bought this mainly for the number of shells I thought I was receiving, it was a little disappointing. Other than that, the curtain IS BEAUTIFUL, seems to be well-made. If you're not bothered by it being less-full than pictured, you won't be disappointed."
1,Caution: Item Title is Inaccurate,"This is a review of the listing, not the product. The product is great, but you may not be getting what you expect. So, without further ado:Caution, the dimensions listed in the main title listing for this item are inaccurate. See the product description further down the page for the actual dimensions."
3,Sent without hardware,"Arrived from Amazon 5 days after ordering without wheels or bolts [hardware] . Had to call Rubbermaid for parts. Service rep. said they would send within 2 days. 7 days later called for update. "" O we just sent them today"". 6 days later I did receive them with no further problem. [2 weeks after arrival of original shipment]6 pounds of hardware needs to be fastened to main parts if shipped in a flimsy box to keep this from happening."
5,Made well,"This cart is great, I wonder how I got along without it all this time. Great to go to the car and load the grocherys and just weel it into the house. Good stuff I would buy again from this company"
4,"Lots of Utility, Easy to Assemble","My only suggestion for improvement of the unit would be that all four wheels would spin 380 degrees; currently, only the ones the instructions indicate to put near the push handle fully rotate. I may try swapping the wheels as it seems to steer better whent he rotating wheels are in the front and the stationary wheels are in the back."
3,"Surrealist, Horror, Psychological Thriller, Art Film","I love Altman, especially from this period, but IMAGES is an aquired taste. It's what would have happened if Maya Deran had made psychological thrillers instead of art films, or if Hitchcock had followed the avant-garde (instead of leading it). It's an interesting experiement, and I enjoyed it, but I would only recommend it to hardcore fans who like the art films of the era (like Antonioni's work). The fact that Altman had a structured story makes it less ""fun"" than M*A*S*H or NASHVILLE, but film buffs will still find a lot of amazing concepts."
2,Poor quality XLR jacks,"The first time I used this the 2nd front input jack broke. I cannot remove the XLR cable from that jack no matter how hard I try. The release button apparently became disconnected so it's just flopping around and isn't releasing the plug. I find the product very useful for plugging mics into my various preamps, so I give it more than 1 star for that reason. But considering this product is nothing more than a few XLR jacks mounted in a rack, having poor quality jacks is really disappointing.FOLLOW-UP 1/11/2011: I was able to repair the broken jack by disassembling it and bending the release pin back to it's original position. So at least the jacks are designed to be repairable."
3,Mixed blessing,"If you're just starting a Duran collection with just CDs, and you're about to get ""Big Thing"" and ""Arena"", this would save you money. Two CDs for the price of one. But if you have them already, you might not need this issue. Also, the cover is of the 1990 ""Liberty"" lineup with Soul Asylum drummer Sterling Campbell, who was in the group from late 1988 to early 1991. I just bought two seperate EU imports instead."
5,Ken Trester's Complete Option Trading System,"This comprehensive 16-hour video course by Ken Trester reveals tactics, strategies and profit-packed secrets and is accompanied by a 312 page course manual. This landmark video and course book package has everything you need to make serious money by risking little and hitting home run after home run. Trester's amazingly simple step-by-step syssem explains everything you need to earn phenomenal profits whether the market fluctuates up or down. Find how to win on 19 of every 30 trades."
4,"Vintage Shearing, but not recorded in 1993","As a professional pianist, I have always enjoyed listening to George Shearing, but this recording is not from 1993 as the cover might lead you to believe. These recordings are a bit syrupy - lots of strings. There are much better recordings of Shearing to buy. If I had to do over again, I would not have bought this particular CD .... the dentist will see you next."
5,Perfect Intro To Shearing,"Of course I'm biased! I've always been in love with the most unique and pleasing sound (piano, vibes and guitar in unison) since the clarinet lead over the reeds of the Glenn Miller sound.The key words here are ""pleasing to the ear"". True, a lot of George's recordings are called ""commercial"" but, hey, who says a true artist of the piano hasn't a right to make a living.The only compaint I have, is that with 30 Capitol albums to choose from, how did the 60's ""Goin' Out Of My Head"" make it to the top 10?Other than that , this is an enjoyable collection of one of the jazz icons of our lives and well worthy of belonging in anyone's collection."
2,Guide to Writing and not much else.,"I had to get this book for a graduate class I am taking and overall I felt it didn't offer anything new in the world of writing.It's basically a news writing book but few differences are mentioned in regards to writing for Web pages. There isn't anything in it about how to program the site or lay it out, it's all style.It isn't much help when you've already read numerous news writing books and taken news writing classes, but for a beginner it might work well."
5,"Comforting, lovely, and full of truth","I received ""Letter to a Grieving Heart"" after the death of my child several years ago. I now have the tradition of giving it to others who are grieving the loss of someone dear. I actually bought an entire case of this book recently. It is a lovely book, that is gentle, and easy to absorb when one's heart and mind are reeling with emotions. Those to whom I have I have given it, have said that as it rests on their coffee table, other family members/friends can absorb the beautiful pictures and concepts in a short time, and are consoled by the the thoughts and sentiments of hope and heaven . . . which are solid truth. As the author states, ""Life is hard, but God is good""."
3,Letter to a Grieving Heart:,Had some trouble getting this book. It appears the first book got 'lost' in the mail somewheres. But after I contacted them I received the next book in good order. The only issue I have with this is the inside cover page was completely covered with a hand written message. Otherwise book in very good shape.
2,disappointing,"I owned this printer for a year and a half. It finally died last week so I was actually motivated enough to get another one. The scanner never worked (tech support couldn't figure it out, and since I don't use a scanner all that often I let it go). As others mentioned, the LCD is terrible. Had to view it from the side while shielding the screen from the other side. Paper jams were frequent. And if one color cartridge was empty, the printer wouldn't work at all (even on B&W setting). Others mentioned good color prints - but I never managed to get good ones even with excellent paper and brother brand ink (and, yes, I do take good photos). However, it did an outstanding job on B&W photographs - crisp with great contrast. And it was useful for printing last minute stuff for work when I was only done said stuff at 3am and it was due at 8. This time, I did my homework before buying a printer..."
1,Very Disappointing -,"No USB cable to connect printer. Set up was very complicated, I ended up calling technical support. After waiting 20 minutes to speak to a live person they troubleshooted me through the process. Together we managed to get the black to print. Unfornately, all attempts at color failed. She said that if I would give her my credit card number, she would see a replacement unit was sent to me. I declined stating I just had bought it today - and I could easily take it back.What a disappointment -- I had high hopes for this print since I already owned a Brother. The compact size and added features is what drew me to it in the first place. Hopefully, the next person who purchases one will have a better experience than I have had."
5,The closest thing I've played to an interactive movie,"I really love this game. Unlike other FPS which usually rely on a really shallow plot ( caught in a dungeon, spaceship etc must shoot my way out ), it lives on a very deep story that draws you in and makes you want to find out what happens next. The graphics are amazing and creepy and so is the sound. another thing I like is that the characters in this game both the good and bad guys comes across as three dimensional and not cardboard cutouts only good for cannon fodder. So if you really want something different from all the other mindless millions of FPS out there then try this."
4,Clive Barker's Undying Does Not Disappoint,"Innovative, clever and creative are three words that aptly describe the gameplay of Clive Barker's Undying. I kept finding myself saying ""how clever!"" at things this veteran gamer has never seen before. The boss killing was a bit redundant and the game was a little linear, but despite those flaws the game is great, spooky fun."
5,Sweet Game...scary as hell,"Wow, great game!Scared... me from start to finish....A First Person Shooter with a nice twist...you can use both hands at the same time (also big points cause you're left handed....hehe)Fast paced - there were times when I wanted to take it slow and explore like you can do in most fps's but was just constently hounded by evil creatures....awesome! kept the action going and had to go back to the areas later to explore.Gets a bit repetitious like all FPS but the story really keeps this game interesting.Great graphics, eerie settings and hellish creatures, you just can't lose."
3,Dead Review.,"The premise of this game was nice. I expected more from Clive Barker. The direction of this story gets lost. I found the plot becoming weaker as the game progressed. The atmosphere was nice. The characters were too stiff. The game is pretty much straight forward. There's one spell which had a physical affect on me. When the screen turns into a purple haze to see and hear beyond normal senses, I found that my eyes became strained. I suffered eye damage from this game. Becareful."
1,Could be a good game but...,"The graphics, sounds and the story in this game are good but the saving feature is just a real pain. Levels are so small that once you entered to the room and want to move on the next area you have to wait for the next level to load, and when that happens repeatedly 4 - 5 times for 20 minutes of game play it really not only gets annoying, but almost pisses you off. Another thing: once you died you have to wait for the level to start again and than load your last save since the game doesn't load it automatically. And it happens very often so instead of actually having fun playing you have to stare at the screen with the sign ""LOADING"" most of the game. So basically it all spoils fun so much that you want to just give up and throw the disk to the garbage.This game could be a good piece, but developers did their best to spoil the fun"
5,"An ""Undying"" Classic!","Clive Barker's Undying is a terrific break-the-mold-FPS. The plot, which involves an evil curse on a family and their mansion, will satisfy anyone who enjoys story-oriented FPS games. Any fans of H.P. Lovecraft will be pretty impressed too--the game borrows heavily from the author. The visuals are a real treat-dark,gothic,and often unsettling. This is one to play with the lights out! I can't think of any other game that had me this on edge and creeped out! Ambient sounds and music are great too. If you're one of those people that loved the flow of ""Half-Life"" and the jump-out-of-your-seat moments of ""Resident Evil"", this one's for you!"
3,grew when I was ready to throw it out,"I actually purchased this some months ago, and followed the directions for about 1-2 months, misting it constantly even putting it in the fridge to try and encourage growth. I got absolutely nothing. So I gave up hope and let it sit in it's open bag and didn't mist it, and when I was ready to throw it out, after leaving it alone for about a month, I noticed it had tiny mushrooms. In total I have about six mushrooms, both on the sides of the log."
1,Don't waste your time or money,"I bought this kit several months ago. It was a lot of bother, and took about 2 months before it produced any mushrooms at all. Then I got about 9 nice mushrooms--that's it. Hardly 2-3 lb. as advertised. It hasn't produced anything since, even though I've carefully followed all the directions. A good mushroom kit should produce lots of mushrooms and also be easy and fun. This kit is a dud. Please don't even bother."
2,Nahhh......,"This was a lot of work for such a small amount of results. It would be appropriate for something such as home schooling, where there would be a LOT of hand's on help as the kit has to be seriously moistened several times a day to to produce mushrooms."
4,Good product with tiny little issue,"I ordered this kit for my husband for Christmas and was dismayed to find that when it arrived, it was in a box with writing and pictures all over it describing the contents...and he got to it first! I would buy this for a gift again, but if it was for a member of my household, I would have it sent to a friend's house to keep it a secret."
5,Great Present for a Vegan,I have a grown daughter that does eat meat anymore...so I get here stuff she can grow and eat....She says this was a great present....that rocks a Daddys world...george
2,Hit & Miss,"Seems like a good product and we actually did get a few Shitake's from it... but not nearly as many as you'd expect. Yes, we re-read the instructions and yes, we tried it several times (5 times) with the same results. Entertaining for my kids the first time, but after several failures they lost interest and my wife continued to buy Shitake's at the grocery store. I am pretty certain we won't do it again."
1,Beware of expiration!,"Be aware that nowhere on the website does it say that this item must be opened and used within 30 days. However, that information was printed on the box so when I received it I called the company to determine if that 30 days is simply a ""recommended to be used by"" date (I wanted to give it as a Christmas gift). They informed me that while there could possibly be a 5-7 day ""grace"" period, the 30-day limit is pretty firm. The company will not refund or exchange this item. I'm sure this is a good product but be sure you are planning to open and start it growing immediately."
2,Mediocre results,"Of six shitake kits we purchased as gifts, only one gift recipient had a good growing experience. The other kits have had very low mushroom production. Purchasing experience was good and the product was shipped promptly."
3,Loved the shrooms,"It was awkward to grow...there wasn't any room to put it, we ended up putting it by the kitchen sink so we could water it daily...We harvested a couple of handfuls of delicious mushrooms before the whole thin started to turn black, so we threw it out. We did not get enough mushrooms to pay for the kit...It was an experiment, for fun, so now we know that growing mushrooms is not for us!"
5,Mushrooms!,"My whole family enjoys watching the mushrooms grow, and they love eating them too!In just a couple of weeks the block was covered with mushrooms. We started eating them early because they were getting too bunched up, not a problem!My girls like taking pictures to document how quickly they grow and comparing the pictures. I think we might use the dehydrator to dry some of them out, we have so many mushrooms!!!Mushrooms in my eggs, brown rice, in my soup, mushrooms are everywhere!!!"
1,The price was good.,"I have had the kit in a cool room for the past six weeks, and have tried to closely follow the instructions. One mushroom grew within the first week and was delicious. I have not had a bud since. Still trying to get some mushrooms. Not sure if its the kit or the present owner, but not satisfied with the results."
1,A flop....,Followed directions and even called company for support....but no mushrooms grew. We were disappointed as we were really looking forward to them.
3,Mehhh,"So a few years ago someone gave me a mushroom kit, and I loved it. I got this thing and it had a fairly nice first flush, followed the instructions to the letter, and now nothing. It's turning black, no sign of new 'shrooms, pretty disappointed."
2,Hurt My Stomach,"I never really got to give this product a fair trial. I took 2 capsules daily for 2 days (a low-end starting dose), and noticed nothing expect severe bowel cramps and reflux, with several days of nausea and cramps afterwards. With so many nutrients in the product, it's impossible to know which one is causing the problem. If you have any sort of sensitive stomach or IBS, I'd recommend staying away from this one."
1,Useless,There is no credible evidence to support the claims made for this product. It is shameless targeting of the vulnerable for profit.Trick or Treatment: The Undeniable Facts about Alternative Medicinecontains an extensive critique of homeopathy: what you are buying here is not medicine but overpriced and misrepresented confectionery.
1,not worth my time,"I gave this to my kid and he is just as much of a little sh#t asas usual. I am just going to go to a real doctor. If that doesn't work I give up. I'll just drop him off at his Dads and head West, never looking back."
1,Kid still misbehaves,"My brat of a son, God bless him, he has ADD. I was not wanting to use drugs with devastating side effects to get him to pay attention in class and not make me want to beat him when he gets home. I gave him this and then he proceeded to rob a liquor store and get himself in jail."
2,It didn't improve attention or concentration,"Tried it on my 8 yr old son, unfortunately we didn't see the results we were looking for.- Didn't improve attention- Didn't improve concentration- Made him a bit overall calmer but with a lathargic affect on his schoolworkLuckily they offer a 1 yr guarantee. We bought it direct from VAXA so we will apply for a refund."
1,It doesn't work.,"I'm 22 and have been suffering from ADD / SCT ever since I was a child. I've only just heard about this supplement a year ago, and was eager to start trying these. Sadly, even after months of maintaining the correct dosage, I have never seen an improvement with my attention span. Fine details still elude me many times, getting motivated for work and schoolwork is still a tedious chore, and driving is occasionally a risky activity for me."
3,It works okay; for a little bit.,"This isn't really a supplement for adderall or anything similar. If you are having a hard time focusing, this did seem to help me for 1-3 months. However I do not find it's helping me study, work, or focus any longer. As previously mentioned it didn't have any other commonly associated features of adderall (if you're looking for them or not), like decreased appetite, energy, etc. Each persons different I've found when it comes to these kind of medications, and it's definitely worth a shot if you need help focusing or studying. Take the recommended dosage for at least a month. I definitely found this significantly more effective then adderrlin.. Good luck!"
2,"maybe for others, not for me","I'm a 48-yr old female with a long history of trying various medications to help me with my ADHD symptoms. i used this product, along with Memorin, for 3 solid months at maximum dosage recommendations. i was very disappointed that i felt and performed no better than before i started using the product. it should be noted that when i contacted a local homeopath about obtaining a refill supply, he said he won't carry this line of product as the manufacturer has a history of poor quality control. That raised an eyebrow but i still continued to use it, to no avail. i give it a '2' rather than a one only because it also didnt have any unpleasant side effects."
1,Nor For Me,"I am an IBS patient struggling with alot of focus/attention difficulties. This is especially troublesome on the job. I bought Attend hoping that it would help alleviate some of the ""brain Fog"" I am currently experiencing. It did not work for me. An hour after taking the first pill I had horrible stomach cramps that resulted in numerous bathroom visits. It may be very helpful for some but if you have IBS I would steer clear!"
1,Didn't notice a change,"Sometimes I have a hard time be productive, I thought I'd give this a try, nothing. I definitely got my hopes up on this one!"
2,"Vaxa ""Attend""",I tried this product and it did not help with my Attention Deficit disorder. One of the main side effects I had whilte taking VAXA Attend is that it made me really hungry. This product did not help me at all. I went back to using Adderall.
3,Its O.K,"This product is fine but no miracle. After having my 8 year old on Intuniv for 8 months, we decided to go natural once again. I feel that if you trully have ADD only real medication will make a real difference. But hey its worth a try, I think everything is worth trying once."
2,Not What I Expected,I did not see any change in my son's behavior or attention improvement.It might be a good product but not for him.
4,works great,I started out giving my son 2 in the morning and 2 at night for the first 30 days. It took half way into the second month before I sawresults. It really works!!
3,not for us,"tried this to help my son, didn't have any effect. it didn't have a negative effect so it didn't hurt. won't do it again."
4,Kirkus,Has anyone noticed that the Kirkus reviews tend to be fairly condescending about works from people of color and they tend to disparage the works as limited in their understanding when in fact it could well be that they themselves are the ones with the limited understanding
2,"Too dry, not enough examples and true life stories","If you like intellectual musings and lofty philosophical principles about adoption, read this book. I could only take a couple chapters of Gritter. My wife read more and felt discouraged about adopting. An adoptive parent we know couldn't get through the first chapter. ""Too dry"", she said.It puzzled me why the author, with many years of adoption counseling experience under his belt, wouldn't use real life stories and examples to illustrate his ideas. There's almost none. Instead he pontificates and lectures; I felt talked down to.Fortunately, our experience with Open Adoption and Family Services in Portland, Oregon was far more positive and down to earth."
3,"Some interesting parts, very wordy","This was required reading by the adoption agency I'm working with. It gives a very good overview of open adoption, sharing the risks and benefits. I felt some of the sections, particularly those describing adoptive and birth parents and adoptees to be interesting and enlightening, giving me a new perspective from other items I've read. Honestly, however, I had to skim large sections - the author spent a lot of time on handling grief (important, but I think too heavily emphasized) and repeating himself."
3,does the job,Brought it for Nuvi 260 W. Its a bit snug but works for me. didnt have time to check out whethers its a right fit for 260s ..
3,It's good but...,I agree with the previous reviewer. The Carrying Case does not fit my Garmin nuvi 650! Very tight. Difficult to take out and put in. Maybe its because it's still new. You can accidentally turn the GPS on when you insert it in the case but I just insert it with the power button side going in first. Functional though and does protect it. It could be better though.
4,Gets the job done,It is what it is a fake leather case with reinforced areas to protect your screen. Mission accomplished. It accomplishes the job well but dont expect to be impressed or blown away by the quality of the product.Update. Im a little dissapointed that as this product got broken in my nav system almost got broken. Ok bad english there but as the case relaxes it doesnt hold the nav system snugly and when picking up my nav system (in the case) it slid out of the case and hit the ground. This pretty much defeats the purpose of having a case and needs a strap on top or something.
2,Garmin leather case too narrow,"I recently purchased the Garmin carrying case for my Garmin 850 nuvi. I agree with another review that the case is too narrow and you have to be careful when you slide it in so it doesn't power on the GPS. Also, once in the case, it is very difficult to pull the unit out without some heavy squeezing. I have been trying to stretch the case by stuffing paper into it so my Garmin will go in and out more easily."
1,Doesn't fit the Nuvi 1490T,This case was suggested by Amazon when I ordered my Nuvi 1490T. It doesn't fit. Bummer!
5,Excellant Nuvi Case,"Never had a case for my old unit and this one is excellent. Some of the reviews may indicate otherwise. Yes--the leather is a little hard and I find it as tough as can be. Now I can take the unit out of the vehicle, slip it into my brief case or pocket and not have to worry about it being stolen when I valet park. Also I can hook up wile sitting on the patio at Starbucks. The case meets all our needs and is exactly as we expected. If you are looking for a soft leather you might be better off just getting a cloth cover at the dime store.I find the protection offered by the case to be very good unless you plan of playing Frisbee with the unit."
3,product quality,product quality 100% recommended. If you buy the GPS that is recomensable buy to protect the device
3,"Very basic carrying case for nuvi, nothing fantastic ...","Bare basic case, no padding whatsoever. Not even sure if its real leather, looks synthetic. Since my nuvi 760's power/hold switch isn't recessed in, it can be accidentally turned on by slipping into this case. The sides of the case isn't stretchy & only good thing is it actually holds the nuvi in place but it can also slide out easily too. But for its price, I still ok with it, just don't drop it with the nuvi inside.What I do not understand is why Garmin would save this small amount of money on the case or why not just offer users a rebate instead of paying full price for it?"
4,Decent Case But Not Worth $20,I purchased this case for my newly purchased Garmin Nuvi 765t and would buy it again because it does what its supposed to protect the unit. Albeit it defiantly cost more then it should I really think this should be a $10 item but unfortunately i you want to protect your GPS you need to overpay for a case.-----Pros-----Snug fit ( maybe a little too snug )Protects unit which is what it is supposed to doCompact and easily transportabledecent build quality-----Cons-----Sometimes a little hard to get out of case because of the tight fitIs expensive for case such as thisOverall if your paranoid and/or just like to protect your device and not want to worry about the screen getting smashed or damaged by other sharp things then this should work fine for you and I would recommend this though I only wish the retail price was $10 on amazon you get close to this so its a pretty good deal.
4,Too Expensive,This is way too expensive but I bought it assuming that I would need to carry the unit around.
3,Nuvi carry case 010-10823-01,"A fairly nice, snug, case. Take care inserting the Nuvi, as the case is snug enough to slide the power switch on while GPS is being inserted, if going the wrong way.Protection for the Nuvi when security requires one to take it into the meeting. Not user friendly if one wishes to use the Nuvi in Pedestrian mode."
5,Must have accesory,"IMO this item is definitely a must have item if you use your GPS in multiple vehicles like I do. Considering the price point of the typical Garmin device this little pouch should be included with the original purchase. I guess it's just another way for them to eek a few more dollars out of the consumer. And it is really just a pouch, nothing fancy, but it does the job fine enough. I would like to see other options, such as a larger, actual case, that would fit the power cord and one of the friction dash mounts, as well."
1,Waste of money,I would give this product a zero star rating if that were possible. Even though this case is a Garmin product that says it is for a Nuvi 650 it is way too small for a Nuvi 650 to go in it. I forced it in about 1/2 way and almost wasn't able to get it back out. I even stuffed it with paper as hard as I could and left the paper in it overnight in an effort to stretch it but the unit still would not go in it. Who ever sewed it together made it too small. It was a complete waste of money for me.
2,Not needed,"I was unaware that a case accompanied the GPS system upon purchase, so I really did not need to buy one."
2,Practically worthless,"I bought this item with the intention of protecting my GPS. However, the GPS unit doesn't come close to fitting in the case. If you have the mounting lug installed on your unit, then it only goes in the case about halfway at best. Consequently I paid the money for something I can't use. I personally don't return things simply because I should have done the work before hand to find out that the item was a waste of money. Bottom line, do not waste your money on this item. It looks good, but doesn't serve the purpose of protecting your GPS"
2,"Okay, so it's a case... protective of dust maybe","This does what it says it does, if you don't plan on packing it in your suitcase, purse, carry-on or so forth. My screen was heavily dented from traveling in all of these things I described. It is very light on the protective side. Don't order this case for anything else but to slip the unit into. The front pocket will hold a credit card so what's the purpose? I needed it to throw the unit into while going from vehicle to vehicle when traveling and it didn't serve its purpose. So if you are storing it in your house, maybe..."
1,Never Received It!!!!,"I purchased this item online 5/24/2010 in MA. Item was supposedly coming from NJ by USPS and after 2 weeks, past the delivery date, I still have not received it. Beach Camera told me they'll ""file a claim"" with USPS. When I asked for an overnight shipment, they said ""I'll do my best"". If you actually want to receive your product... order from somewhere else!"
2,An unwise purchase,"Unless you plan to use the Garmin instead of your smart phone, you don't need this item. It's useless if you're only going to use the Garmin in your car."
3,"It's ok, but you could live without it","I use this for long term storage, but most of the time it is more annoying than useful."
4,Slick,Slick little case to protect your unit when it's not hanging off your windshield. Reasonable price.
4,"Nice, clean design","Good for a low profile, non-bulky simple cover. Protects the device well. I'd recommend using no matter where and how device is stored, just to provide additional protection (e.g. could keep the cord and connectors from scrathcing the GPS screen when stored together)."
4,Clean design,Carrying case is good fit. Good construction. Could use a strap or flap to close the top.
1,Nuvi GPS Carrying Case,"This carrying case is just fine for the GPS but only protects it and not the other things you have to support the GPS. Would have been nice to get a GPS bag that carries the cords, etc. As I said before, this works okay."
1,Garmin Leather Case,"I got it because it was included. I love the GPS but the case real cheap. I use a camera case, and it works great. Make sure when buying the garmin to get the AC adapter also. You will be glad you did."
3,Garmin leather carrying case,"This is an OK product as far as it goes. But Garmin really needs a nice carrying case that will hold a GPS unit, its power cord, and whatever attachment device one chooses to use. A carrying case that cannot hold all three of these things is, in all honesty, relatively useless. This unit holds only the GPS and even that is a very snug fit. For example, there is no room to hold even the supplied ""intro"" instructions, much less the real manual, which is available only by download from the Garmin website. So if you want to carry only your GPS, it'll work well enough. However, for most of us, this fails to meet the minimun requirements."
1,Too small,GARMIN 010-10823-01 Leather Carrying Case For Nuvi Travel AssistantThis case is too small for the Garmin 650. Had to force it in and then it was difficult to remove. Probably won't use it.
4,"Great Case, Can accidentally turn on GPS","I bought this case from my Nuvi 760, I would buy it again.Pros+ reinfoced front and back makes for a sturdy case that protects the device from both scratches and impacts+ very snug but easy to get in and out - hasn't ever slipped out+ good size, it is about as small as it can be+ soft interior to prevent scratches+ small sleeve on the sideCons- It is snug enough to sometimes slide the power switch on the 760 as I take it in or out. I need to make sure it goes in with the switch down and locked so it doesn't come on when I put it in. Coming on on the way out isn't such a big deal since I usually want to use it.Overall this is a great case, if you are careful you could call auto-power-on a feature!"
5,Fits very well,"Very well constructed, and fit my Nuvi 650 perfectly. I would recommend it to protect your Nuvi"
4,"Good, but a little tight",It is a nice solid case. It is a little bit of a tight fit. You have to be careful which direction you put the GPS in. It is so tight that it will flip the power switch on the top if you go the wrong way.
1,Cool !!!!! I can get fifteen bucks for this case.,I received this case with my Garmin 265wt at a wholesale store. This is one of the lowest quality cases I have ever seen. For free it's alright with me. It will hold me over until my nicer case comes in the mail which includes a cleaning cloth and screen saver for the same price. I wonder if someone pocketed these out Garmin boxes and are cashing in.The hard plastic on both sides of the case protect the screen from direct impact. The open end is open putting your product at risk from spills or rain. Stores and I'm sure Amazon have cases which are compact and water resistant that blow this one away. I suppose you could put a stylist in the pocket or some money or clip a pocket knife or small pen on it. Fake leather very cheap feeling.How this got 4 stars is beyond me.
1,"Too big, poor design","This case is too big for Nuvi 350, the unit would easily slip out and I almost drop it several times. They should have put a strap around the opening to fix this problem. I'm honesty surprised to see all those 4 and 5 star ratings. Maybe they have a different model and therefore a different size, but obviously this thing is not good for Nuvi 350. If you have a 350, take my advice."
2,Garmin case,"Garmin caseIts handy and convenient. But it does not fit my Garmin 855 (wide) properly, very tight. Although its meant for 4.3 inch Garmin, the case was probably did not consider in fitting 855 (wide) overall dimension. Its so tight that the module is stuck in the case like been super glued. Its a heavy task to get it out once in, which is suppose to slip in and out easily.As for the asking price, its bit high for a simple case compared to those medium hard case (with zipper and screen protector throw in). The Garmin case front slip pocket doesn't serve any purpose at all. If an SD card is kept inside, its difficult to reach and getting it out is another task."
1,Make sure its the correct case,"love my new nuvi 1490, but the suggested case of other items purchased is not he correct case for the larger 1490. now I have re-ordered the correct case for additional costs."
2,Garmin Nuvi Leather Carrying Case,"Well, it is okay. Just what it is, a carrying case, does not have room for anything else but the Garmin itself. The case is really a snug fit, so when you slide the device into the case, the Garmin tend to accidentally turn itself on without you knowning and run the battery down. So if you wanted to walk around town, you are stuck without battery life."
5,Garmin Nuvi 265wt case,I would recommend getting a case to keep it clean and scratch free when not in use
4,"Nice, But I'd..............","This carrying case does what most people would want. It protects your GPS from screen scratches and light impacts. However, I consider it more of a slipcover than a case. My Nuvi 760 fits in very snugly and doesn't appear to want to fall out at this time. I don't know if it will loosen up with time and wear, but I think it will. The fit is so snug that it will actually drag the sliding power switch when you put it in or take it out. You want to make sure you put it in switch first, so that it won't turn itself on upon insertion. I would have preferred a little less snugness and a thin fold over flap with Velcro. There is no belt loop or clip if that is important to you. There are a lot of aftermarket choices so don't be afraid to shop around. So in summary, not a bad product, but it could be improved."
5,Garvin Leather carrying case,"Very good case, the garmin nuvi 760 fits in it very well and protects the device. I recommend it for anyone purchasing the garmin gps."
1,"Useless, too tight and it turns the unit on while putting away","This slip case is too tight, the sides bulge out when the GPS is inserted and the side hits the power switch which makes it turn on."
3,Hard Case would be better,Got a case for the Garmin Nuvi 365WT - disappointed in the protection - Hard Case would protect the unit better and more reliable.
5,Garmin Carrying Case fills the bill,The case is high quality and protects the GPS when it is not mounted in the car. It is the same quite good case that Garmin used to supply with the unit.
3,Good protection but keeps turning device on,The carrying case is good protection for my nuvi device but is somewhat flawed in that the device turns on whenever i remove it from the case due to the case hitting the on switch.
3,case,The Garmin 760 fits quite snugly in the case offering what appears to be great protection. The only downside is the lack of space for anything else. I am not sure I want to rely on the outside pocket for exta SD cards. It does not close so the card might slip out unknown and be damaged if something hit the side. Overall it has been great for protection in the car..
2,WAY too snug initially for the 600's...had to STRETCH it...,"The Garmin case that came with my 350 is MUCH softer than this, thicker leather and just fits ""right"".There was NO way initially of getting my 660 into this without accidentally turning the power on/off when trying to pull it out.I am trying to stretch it for the second day by getting it a little damp and shoving a comparably sized cell phone case in plus some butter knives down the sides for a little added stretch. I wasn't sure if it was going to work, or tear, but it has eased up but it is still a VERY tight fit. I have decided now that my 350 case is a little too loose and am going to slip something in to tighten it up.If you can find a quality alternative, reasonably priced, that allegedly fits you might want to go for it, this is REALLY tight, and not the best quality, and not worth the shipping return..."
5,Good for the price,The case is not as sturdy and it does not seem as durable as I expected but for the price under $5 you can't beat it. My wife can now put the GPS in her purse without the fear of the screen getting scratched.
2,"Newer Garmin 4.3"" screen models may not fit","Even though this case showed up as a recommended accessory when I purchased a new Garmin 1390LMT, it was a VERY tight fit. I would not recommend this case for any newer 4.3"" models. At least it was cheap, because it won't get much use. Of course, that could be why is is so inexpensive - there are few models it will actually fit..."
4,Must have...,Happy with purchase. It's just a case - nothing fancy.Needed something strudy to protect our nuvi 200w.It does the job.
1,A waste of money,"Garmin does not include a carrying case in the sale of its GPS units. In an effort to prevent damage, particularly screen scratches, to the unit, a carrying case seems a reasonable idea. However, this one is nothing fancy - it doesn't seem to be leather but is solid vinyl - although it does fit the unit. If you want to protect your screen, you might consider this, although it is just another effort by Garmin to nickle-and-dime you with accessories that should be included in the purchase price of the GPS unit."
5,case,A great and easy to use case to carry Garmin. It works well as protection and is small and unobtrusive
2,Poor design makes this carrying case a bad buy,"While this carrying case appears to be well constructed, its side panels are too tall for a 760. Had someone actually pushed a Nuvi into the original design, they would have either reduced the height of the side panels or cut slots in them to allow for the on/off slide switch. You have to be very careful when inserting the GPS into the case that the side panel doesn't catch the on/off switch and turn the GPS on. If I had it to do over, I'd buy a zippered camera case from Wal-Mart."
3,Not a good fit,This is nice looking case but one problem is that once you put the Garmin Nuvi in the case it is very difficult to get it out again because it is such a tight fit. Also it is so tight it turns the Garmin on as you slide it into the case. Then of course you have to try to get it back out to turn it off. I found it very frustrating.
3,"Basic, No-frills Carrying Case","I purchased this Garmin Carrying Case along with my Garmin Nuvi 1390T. I feel that it was pricey for a very basic, no-frills carrying case. However, it does fit my GPS unit snuggly, while allowing me to easily get the unit in and out. The soft interior does protect the unit's screen from scratches, and the case is small enough that I can slip it into a coat or jacket pocket.The shipping was prompt. The case arrived within a week, as part of an order with free shipping.In sum, I feel that the Garmin Carrying Case essentially does what it is advertised to do, but it was overpriced."
4,Should have came with the unit,Garmin is being really cheap making us buy this simple case when it should have came with the unit in the first place looking at the cost of some of the products you sell.But it does help to have one.
2,Too tight.,It's a struggle to get my nuvi 765 in or out of this case. I've had no trouble with other nuvis or other similar cases.
3,It does what they say it does!,"If you never plan to remove your nuvi from your car, then do not buy this case as you'll never use it. We use it when we're going to fly somewhere and then rent a car. The case affords the nuvi's screen some protection during transit, such as when in a backpack or something. The case itself is of decent construction; there aren't any frills but it does its job capably enough."
3,garmin case protector,"The item is as stated, but shipping cost almost as much, would have been cheaper to buy at the store."
3,Garmin Carrying case for Nuvi GPS,"It does what it's suppose to do, protects my GPS, nothing special other than that."
4,Garmin Leather Case,Great for carrying/protecting a cell phone. Not so great carrying the Garmin GPS around...I never have the GPS disconnected enough to use the case.
1,never got the case I ordered,This case was separately sent from Ritz camera. The problem was they sent the wrong case. The item they sent was 010-10723-02 which was too small to fit the Garmin I bought. When I contacted them they said I would be credited my money back but couldn't return the item. So I still don't have the Garmin 010-10823-01 I ordered; so have to go find it somewhere else and throw this one they sent away. I would of preferred to send it back in exchange for the one I really ordered. Not sure I'll order from Amazon again. Carol
3,Turns on GPS when inserted in the case,"Pros- Low price, protection for my GPS.Cons- When Gps is inserted in case it rubs the power button causing it to turn on.Other than that not a bad case for the price..."
5,Case for NUVI,"Nice little case. Good value.A belt clip would have been cool, but then so would a fishing boat for Christmas :-)"
5,Garmin GPS case,Great case for the new Garmin GPS we have just purchased through Amazon. The case itself is made well and a good size to fit a pocket or hide away inside the car. As always we have had great service from Amazon.com together with a great price and speedy delivery-cannot ask for more
1,Bad Amazon Recommendation,Amazon recommended it and I never checked it any further as I figured Amazon knew what model I had purchased. What I received was not designed for the nuvi 760 that I had purchased. It sits on the counter waiting for me to get it together to ship it back. Beware of Amazon recommendations and check models before you buy.
4,Good protective case,This case fits the Nuvi 660 very snugly. It serves its purpose well in that it helps to protect the screen when the unit is not in use. One potential problem is that some screen protectors will come off when putting the GPS in the case because the fit is so snug.
1,Garmin 765T Carrying Case,"I hate to say it but this case is terrible. It's WAY to tight. Every time I pull the GPS unit in or out, one of the buttons is pressed. I even set it in the sun and still couldn't stretch enough. My advice is save your money. Sorry"
3,too tight a fit,"I purchased this to carry my Nuvi 650. It's such a tight fit, I have to use tools and brute force to pull the Nuvi out of the case. Right now, I have a piece of wood inside the case, to stretch it somewhat. Otherwise, it's a nice looking case."
4,Quality case with a very tight fit,"The leather carrying case is ideal for storing your Garmin in a purse, fanny pack or other small space while away from your car. It has a small outer pocket for storing memory cards which can be useful. The only downside and it is small, is how tight the Garmin 650 fits into it. You need to press very firmly to get the GPS all the way in and when you pull it out, if you have the on button at the outside corner, you will definitely turn the device on before removing it from the case. Not really an issue, but I would have liked a little less tight fit."
5,Handy little carrying case,"I bought this for my husband, along with a Garmin Nuvi and a friction dashboard mount. He loves everything, and finds this little leather case so handy to slip the Garmin in and pop in his briefcase. I bought this as a package along with the Garmin and the mount...good purchase. I highly recommend this case."
4,Does the job,"This case does as advertised to protect the GPS and screen. Snug fit and will easily fit in shirt pocket or purse. Nothing fancy and, in my opinion, should be included (like the dash mount and cables) with the Garmin. It is practically a necessity if you carry it or move it between vehicles."
3,OK solution,"Looking at most of the carrying cases, I found them to be much too bulky, I don't need a box for cables, spare memory cards etc, I just needed something to transport the GPS between car and home/work (to not leave it in the car). I don't expect much for $12 and this is an OK and very compact solution to cover the Garmin nüvi 760 for that purpose, even though I think Garmin should include a solution for the GPS's price tag...For the person who wrote a 2-star review and complained about the hard sides and the tight fit: that is the whole point! You don't want the GPS to fall out of its carrying case, hence, it needs to be very snug. And for the lack of padding: if it is snug and has two hard shells, there is no need for padding, the screen gets protected very well by the hardness of the main sides, even if you were to drop it.One tip, however, is to push the GPS in with the ON/OFF switch last, otherwise, you will turn the unit on as you slide it in."
3,Simple and effective,The leather case from Garmin is basically what I expected. A simple case that provides protection for my gps when not in use. My one complaint is that Garmin GPS models with the slider on/off switch can be inadvertently turned on when placing them into the case.
2,Garmin 4.3 inch Carrying Case,"The Garmin 4.3 inch Carrying Case was delivered very quickly and in excellent condition. The seller did an excellent job. There was nothing wrong with the case, but I gave it a 2-star rating because I personally did not find it very useful. I suppose this case may be nice if you decide to take the GPS with you when you go hiking in the woods so you can carry it in your pocket without scratching the screen. But for me, considering the fact that there are other components (suction cup mount/bracket, instruction book, and the power cord) to store somewhere when the GPS is not being used, I'd recommend getting a case that can store all of these things in one place.Denny"
2,Useability,The quality of construction is very good but the fact that it does not completly enclose the device proves to be very ineffective. It needs to have a closure to be effective. Would not recommend.
4,A case that fits.,This leather case fits like a glove and just as hard to get off but works well. Take care not to switch unit on when sliding into the case. A little ribbon loop to pull the gps out with helps a lot but you have to make your own.
1,Poor fit,"This case is too small for the product it is designed to protect. The first few times we put the Garmin in it, we had to pull very hard to get the Garmin back out. Now we put the Garmin in only 75% of the way."
3,Great case!!! Where's the strap???,"What you see is what you get. A very nice leather-soft lined case with a a pocket, and no strap or tab help avoid an accidental drop."
3,One Major Flaw - on an otherwise excellent product,"This case has one major flaw for me: Sliding my GPS (Nuvi 250W & Nuvi 780) into this case almost always turns the unit on. Unless you take special care putting the unit into the case, the Power slide switch will be grabbed by the case and flipped on. More than once, I drained the battery because I didn't realize the unit was turned on. This isn't a big deal if you're at home but if you're relying on the ""Last Position"" and/or ""Where Am I?"" features to get you from the convention center to your car, you might have a nasty surprise at the end of your day.The quality and fit are top notch. It's not as bulky as the off-brand zippered case I bought for my first GPS and the little pouch on the outside of this case is handy for putting a parking lot ticket."
3,Other case options,"I have a case like this for my smaller Garmin and I really think I will like the case with the flap much better. It will be much easier to open the flap, than to pull the nuvi out and then put it back in.Thank YouGarmin 4.3-Inch Premium Carrying Case with Flap"
5,Great case,"I purchased this case for my garmin because my finance' has the same one. Its protective and convienent. My garmin 255W fits perfectly. I wish the colored ones cost the same as this one.Its a handy-dandy case. Keeps the GPS safe i your glove box, purse or whereever."
3,Case interferes with switch operation,This case actuates the power switch as you insert or remove the unit from the case. Earlier model GPS units had a push type switch and didn't have a problem with this type of case. The 700 series Nuvi units use a slide switch which gets actuated by the elastic sides of the case. It is also very hard to remove the unit from the case if fully inserted.
5,Quality,The item is made well and is compact to hold GPS unitIt is great protection for the unitI would recommend it
5,Durable,We very happy with this product. We are happy that it is an option to make life easier. We will recommend this product to everyone.
4,Carrying Case,"Real buy for the money. Works well. Only problem, I leave attached to power source that connects with cigarette lighter. This creates a non-insurmountable problem!"
1,Garmin Carrying Case too small,"I really hate the Garmin Carrying Case for nuvi 650 because the Garmin doesn't fit properly in the case. It is much too tight of a fit. If I had time, I would have sent it back as I am very disappointed."
5,Great Case for my Nuvi 750,"This case does exactly what it is supposed to do. It protects your garmin gps from scratches, and accidental drops. I use it with a Garmin Nuvi 750, and had no problems at all. Fits perfectly. Highly recommend it."
2,Disappointed :-(,"well it is what it is, seems a bit cheap-o to me reminds me of the case I got with my Dell Axim, it is leather....but beware it looks very supple in the picture, when in actuality it is very hard, and fits the GPS very very tightly almost too tight for my taste. would definitely be a lot better if it were made from a more better grade of leather. but just my thoughts. buy it if you like but remember looks may be deceiving."
4,Good case,"I ordered this case when I bought my Garmin 660. However, the unit came with a case and I sent this one back. The one that came with the unit was exactly the same. This case works well to protect the unit and transport it. It has a nice pocket on front which you can slip cards, paper, etc. into."
2,Garmin carrying case for Nuvi 650,The case is a perfect fit. It slides in and out with just the right amount of grip to keep it from falling out. However I think if was a big mistake to not include a belt clip. After all the Nuvi has an internal battery for using it away from car or home. How do they expect it to be carried?Good product in other respects.GARMIN: PLEASE ADD A BELT CLIP OR MEANS TO CARRY.
5,Good choice,No more or less than is claims to be.Seems like a quality product. The GPS slides in and out easily. A little sleeve for a spare SD card. No annoying velcro fastener. Great for storing in the console or keeping it in a pocket or carry bag.Would certainly buy this again.
4,Great Protection For Your Garmin Nuvi GPS Investment,"There is not much that I can say about this case. After all, it is just a basic leather case. It may be a bit plain looking but it definately offers great protection for the pricey Nuvi GPS product line.I have used this model case for the Nuvi 250W and the Nuvi 660. Both units fit snug, although the Nuvi 660 fits almost too snug. As another reviewer pointed out, you do not need to purchase this case for the Nuvi 660 unless you want an extra, since this exact case is included with the 660 package.I give this product 4 stars, but its solid build and great protection. It will not win any beauty contests. It is just a plain looking case, which could use softer leather and more padding. A closing top flap with a magnetic closure would also be a welcome addition. Still, it is inexpensive and goes a long way to protect your portable electronic investment."
4,"Great Case, Great Price","The Garmin Nuvo 650 does no come with a case, so this was a must have for my boyfriend. We bought this hoping it would be the quick case for when we had to put the Garmin into a suit case or glove box.The quality is great, and its a great size. We both love the fact that it does not take up very much room and doesn't add very much bulk to the Garmin."
4,Good quality but expensive leather overkill,My son lost the original cover and I made him replace it. I was shocked that it was fine leather at almost $20. A good vinyl could have done the trick. Don't lose yours.
1,Disappointed...,"I bought this as a gift, along with a Nuvi 765T, for my wife for Christmas. It fits so tight on the unit that my wife can't get the Nuvi out of the case when it is fully inserted. She said she wouldn't use it, so it is going back."
1,Does not fit !,Unless you are going to be using the Garmin outside the car (and the battery does not last long enough for that) this accessory is not very useful. Problem is that it only fits if you take off the mounting bracket.
3,nuvi 750,"Looks good, good quality material. Only problem is it will not hold the the mount needed to mount the nuvi to the dash."
3,"Good case from Garmin, but tight","I have had another Garmin case for the Nuvi 350 and it fit comfortably on the unit. This case is really tight and hoping it will loosen up a bit with keeping Garmin in...it has a bit, but still not great. Garmin really should take note and fix. Quality is good."
5,Works Just Fine,"If you are looking for an upscale, high quality, soft leather case, this is not it. On the other hand, if you want a case that provides adequate protection for the screen of your 700 series nuvi, this is for you.And if you put your nuvi in the case the right way, it will turn the unit on for you, when you take it out. The Garmin Carrying Case works just fine."
3,wrong item sent -no item number on web site.,the case sent to me by beach cites was wrong item. amazon show picture with no garmin item number. I don't blame beach cities they refunded money but not shipping.
3,Garmin 4.3 Inch Carrying Case,A bit too small. You have to force the unit inside.Need to be made with a little more room
2,Case for an nuvi 855,"I bought this case along with a nuvi 855. The package says it should fit an 800 series, however, it is much too small. The contruction is ok, but the cheap plastic covering seems to have shrunk or was cut too small. I was only able to slide the 855 partially in and could bearly get it out.This case is pretty much worthless. I do not recommend buying it.I had another Garmin that came with a case. That case fit very well. It was also made from better materials."
5,Great case,"Works well, does what it is suppose to do - protect the GPS while carrying it to and from vehicle. It is not a hard cover rugged case. Fits my Nuvi 765t perfect."
3,nice but probably unnecessary,"nice quality item but unless you're really concerned about protecting your Nuvi, you can probably live without this, especially for the price"
2,A Bit Disappointing,"The case will protect the gps, the only issue I have is that it is easy to turn the unit on by mistake as it is being slid into the sleeve."
4,A tight fitting case for Garmin Widescreen (255w),"The is slimmer than most GPS case out there. It is a slip on and fits tightly to your 4.3"" screen or widescreen Garmin (mine is 255w). The only problem I have with this design is if you slide the GPS with the siding ""ON"" button, it might turn on when you put it away. Make sure you side the end with the ""ON"" button last. I like the leather slip-on size and look, kind of like some of the older iPod slip-on case you get from apple."
1,Needs a little work,"Positive: It looks nice, feels nice, and protects the screen very well.Negative: Maybe this is just because it's new, but I find it hard to get the Garmin out. Worse though, the close fit on the sides ""diddles"" with the slide switch and may turn the unit on."
4,Does what its supposed to,"The case is leather on the outside, and has a soft interior. All in all it does what it is supposed to: it protects your Nuvi. Its not a hard case, so obviously it has its limitations. The only problem I have with it is that when you remove the nuvi from the case the edge of the case often catches the power/screen lock button. This results in the unit being turned on, or the screen locking, depending on how you have the unit oriented in the case. This is only a minor annoyance because I always put the nuvi in the case such that it turns on when removing it, and usually if I'm taking the nuvi out of the case I'm about to use it anyway."
2,Careful...,"I generally don't write reviews, although I love reading reviews of products before I purchase. Please be careful with this product. The Garmin device slides very easily in and out of the case. Very easily. I have had the device fall out of the case a few times without warning. I would recommend the designer to put a strap on the top of the case to keep the Garmin from falling out."
1,Too tight,The case we ordered for our Garmin 660 was not large enough to comfortably accomodate our unit although it was advertised to fit. Too tight and difficult to insert and pull out. Not reccomended.
3,NO BELT CLIP!,"This would be perfect with a belt clip or loop and a snap on the end to keep it from falling out. Could have been excellent, Garmin only gets a B-."
3,Protect your expenseve GPS,Protecting your investment is what this accessory is all about. I fits my Garmin 750 perfectly and protects it when I have it stored in the glove box.
2,Garmin Carrying Case For Nuvi 600 Series,"This is the official carrying case for the Garmin 600 series GPS's, but it's mediocre in quality. It is essentially a sleeve that the GPS slips into. The case does offer protection from scrathes, etc. However, there is no closure, so the GPS will fall out if you invert the case by accident. After a couple weeks of light duty, the case has also started to show some wear along the edges. You can probably find better and more durable protection elsewhere."
1,Don't buy this - it comes with one!,"Don't waste you money on this. I bought one by mistake, and the process to return it seemed so onerous that I just ate the unnecessary cost. If you are buying a Garmin GPS, it comes with an identical case IN THE BOX ALREADY."
1,Garmin Carrying Case for Nuvi 660 (010-10823-01),I bought a Garmin Nuvi GPS and Amazon recommended this additional product. I purchased it and didn't need it. Don't be fooled into buying this case since the Garmin Nuvi GPS units include the carrying case. I was very unhappy with this purchase and don't have time to send it back. Beware!
2,simple filxes need,"The on/off switch is deficient in that it's difficult to keep it in one or the other. It doesn't click into place. And more importantly, the keyboard is not accurate most of the time. Often you get an adjacent letter instead of the one you touch, and have to go back and start over."
1,accessory does not fit product,"I bought this carrying case for my Garmin Golflogix GPS. However, the unit will only fit in the case (and with great difficulty) after taking all attachments off the GPS first. It is virtually worthless to me."
1,Didn't get it,"Although the tracking showed this delivered, I never got it so I had to call Amazon's customer service which took me 20 minutes to find. No effort was made to find out what happened to the item. Although I have not had problems with Amazon before, I'm a little worried about buying anything more expensive. I asked the customer service person to pass along my comments and I don't think he understood me or had the option of passing along my concern."
1,Included in the Nuvi 660 box,"I ended up returning this item, because a carring case was included in the box when the unit arrived."
4,Garmin 4.3 Inch Leather Carrying Pouch,"Pouch appears exactly as seen in the image. It is black in color, feels stiff to hold and is well crafted. The Garmin 4.3"" unit fits in snugly and will not slip out if turned upside down. The case looks sturdy enough that it might even save the Garmin unit from damage if dropped although I wouldn't recommend any buyer put it through that test. There is a noticable odor (VOCs) emanating from the product. It doesn't bother me but in case you are sensitive to smells that resemble shoe polish, this might not be for you. Otherwise, it is a decent product and reasonable value for money.Lastly, I think Garmin should provide a protective case but since they don't, this one fits that need well."
2,Case History,This case keeps my GPS safe from the travails of modern life. Would we all have the same.
4,Nice addition,"This is convenient for transporting this Garmi from car to home. I bought the 3 package deal (Garmi,leather case, and friction mount) so I did get this at a reduced price. It's a personal decision to buy or not, all depends on how much you'll be transporting your unit."
5,Garmin GPS Case,Good leather case designed for the model I purchased.You'll need a case for protection and convenience and this one fits like a glove.
3,A bit small for nuvi500,"Ordered for my Garmin nuvi500. Perhaps over time it'll loosen up a bit, but it is a very, very tight fit. Have a bugger of a time getting the GPS out after I put it in. Overall, concept is sound and should protect the unit as I expect it to."
4,Keeping your Garmin GPS looking like new.,"The case I purchased for my Garmin 650 is well made and fits the 650 like a glove. When I have finished using the unit I slide it into the case and toss it into the glove box. (albiet gently) I don't have to worry about damage to the GPS, either physical or cosmedic."
5,Very good case,Good fit and finish. Nice case for keeping my 265WT clean and unscratched. It would have been nice to have a belt clip but I just slip it in my pocket.
3,Only accomodates the device,"It is a case for your garmin - not a ""carrying"" case. I expected it to hold more than just the device. I guess I should have looked more closely at the image and figured out that such a slim case wouldn't be able to accomodate anything else."
5,a needed addition,"This carrying case is a quite basic, snug, no frills pouch for protecting the 660 (in my case, 650) navigator from scratches in the glove box or from minor drops. I thought it may have a pocket for storage -- it does not, but probably none is needed for use away from a car since no accessories are needed for use. The increase in dimensions when using the case is so slight that it still fits in most men's shirt pockets, yet helps prevents the 660 from sliding out when one bends forward."
4,Garmin case is good but...,This case was good but two negative points: it should have come with the Garmin and it should also have a way to store the little bracket that holds the Garmin to the stand...it's loose and I've already lost it!
4,"Review of 4.3"" Garmin Carrying Case","Provides adequate storage and protection for 4.3"" garmin gps unit. Provides little to no storage for additional accessories."
5,It fits,"Fits nicely, has soft cloth interior which prevents scratches. Doesn't have an extra pen pocket for the touch-screen pen but it has a pocket for credit cards or cash."
1,Doesn't Fit Properly,"This case is useless, as it doesn't clip to your belt, it doesn't fit my nüvi 885T (and it was a recommended accessory) and if it did... removing the unit would be problematic. Drop hazard would prove useless as well. Wish Apple would get into the GPS and accessory business."
2,Not for Garmin Nuvi 3700 Series,This carrying case is too big to fit the Garmin Nuvi 3700 series. You will need a thinner case as this new Nuvi is really slim.
1,Please Do NOT buy this product.,Do not buy this product. It can not hold the GPS unit tightly. I already dropped my new GPS unit while i was holding this case with my gps in it. Since then my GPS stopped functioning. I had to by a new GPS unit. I bought another case with Zip.
4,good value!,"This Garmin carrying case fits perfectly. I received it within 5 days and though it is not leather as I'd have liked, the price was great and it is fine for daily use."
3,cheap Garmin case,"This is a ""case"" of you get what you pay for. It was a cheap case, I knew that when I bought it. If my brain had been in gear on that day, I would have realized that, based on the size, only the unit inself, (and that just barely), would fit. Therefore no place to store cord or window holder. Better than nothing as it keeps in unit from getting scratched. Oh well, live and learnGarmin nüvi 1300LM 4.3-Inch Portable GPS Navigator with Lifetime Map Updates."
4,Okay Case,"Wish this came with a strap to keep the Garmin in, it will easily fall out if tipped the wrong way!"
4,Put these cats on your radar,"Its good to see rappers who still have fun with the music and dont just use it as a hustle. Every artist who makes music hopes that it will be profitable enough that they can do it for a living, but some rappers cant stop saying that they rap just for the money. Its clear that TM does it for the love!Lyrics and beats are nice throughout the CD. Each member of the group sounds polished as MCs and are able to keep it interesting without resorting to gunplay, dope-dealing and womanizing.Standout songs are Ode 2 tanya, We Be, Want u to Want me and We right here.The album has a early 90's rap feel to it and it works. The only problem is that the production sounds really underground. The beats are good, but dont sound like they were made on top of the line equipment. So I hope they get more successful and are able to build on the style because they have potential to be a household name.www.miccheckinc.com"
4,Hip Hop is not Dead!!,"When I first read about this group I thought the concept was pretty cool.Three male rappers naming their group Tanya Morgan.Trust me, if you read why then it makes sense.Musically, if you like Little Brother,Kanye West,Mos Def,One Below,etc. then you'll enjoy this cd.They're actually better than a lot of underground groups because they have personality and charisma.The music is crazy and they're fun to listen to.If you hate radio rap you gotta get this album!"
1,Absolutel hocum!!!!,"Ms. Colvin comes up with the most fantastic idea that Marie Vetsera survived the tragedy of Mayerling. She presents Vetsera, Larisch and the Empress Elisabeth as more sinned against than sinning. Her contention that they are buried in Texas is absolute twaddle! She needs to be more precise in her sources - of which there are none in evidence, apart from a few vague ""family gossip"" references in the introduction. She obviously needs to research much more deeply into the whole subject and approach it fom a more objective point of view. The style is puerile and simplistic, e.g. one gives up counting how many times Larisch ""pushed back her hair with her hand"" - what else would she use, her foot!!!"" A most disappointing and inaccurate read. Not worth buying!!"
1,shame on kultur: one star for them!,"no subtitles for this masterpiece! at least english, would have helped the non-english-speaking listenermost of the kultur productions suffers the same. any alternative to kultur, then?"
2,Historically interesting performance,"The Jon Vickers performance of Peter Grimes is regarded as a real alternative to the classical Pears recording, and so, musically, it is. What is disappointing, though, about this DVD for the contemporary viewer and listener is the drabness and gloom of the set and the poor quality of the sound recording. The singing and the orchestra are excellent, but are inadequately conveyed by the primitive technology of this version.Britten - Peter Grimes / Davis, Vickers, Harper, Bailey, Royal Opera Covent Garden"
1,Buyer beware....,"I purchased this watch in September 2012. It was my second Luminox watch. The first had a problem with the hands coming loose and it was not repairable. That one lasted about 2 years. Probably should have learned my lesson but I thought the glowing hands were really neat. Ordered another last September and a few weeks ago, while on a trip, the winding mechanism came completely out when I was resetting the time. Got home took it to the watch repair guy (good reputable place) and again, not repairable. So, checked out when I purchased it, assumed it would be under warranty but nope. Warranty is 30 days. Way to stand behind your product Luminox/Amazon. Maybe I'm really unlucky or maybe these are just poor quality watches with a feature that sucked me in TWICE. Ordered a new Casio G-Shock with lots of features, including an LED back lighted face that works well. So far I like the Casio a lot. You decide, just thought I'd share my experience/disappointment."
2,Don't Go Back in the Water!,"I bought this watch for its ability to be seen at night, and it's rugged reputation. The fact that they manufacture watches for the SEALS was not a bad feature. After wearing this watch for a few months, it fogged after a shower at sea level? It does all the other things it claims, just take it off before you shower."
1,Not Working!,"I recieved this watch and after 2-weeks, it stopped working?! I want to send it back to Buzmart, but thier Customer Service phone does not work??!! I want to send it back and get a new one, but where and how do I send it if the seller does not answer?!Someone contact me ASAP, please at 646-239-4666.Thank you,David Gomez"
2,purcheser,i boght this item from you and you sent me the wrong one. i put all my car info in and still got the worng one. i needed the exact one in the picture for a 1994 chevy s-10 2.2L 4cylinder and receive a comlete diffrent style and size. i got a 8 cylinder set
4,Very enjoyable,"Like the reviewer below I bought this book a little guiltily. I already know quite a lot abot Iris Murdoch and I was curious to know what on earth this comic book could have to say about such a serious writer and for what audience. However it's a fun and surprisingly informative read and I certainly learnt things about Murdoch that I didn't know before. It also got me interested in Murdoch all over again and I am now re-reading some of the novels and catching up with those I missed out first time round. It makes me happy to see so many positive reviews of the Murdoch books on Amazon and so many delighted new readers. It almost looks like she's becoming quite a cult. Perhaps one day soon I'll be able to stop saying ""I know it's unfashionable to like Iris Murdoch but..."""
3,"Good, but could be better","Hyland goes through various crises and problems that plagued the Clinton administration, but neglected to address the rising terrorist threat. Al-quada attacked our facilities in Saudi Arabia and Africa, which significantly refocused American attention to a growing danger. It would have been interesting to have read how the interplay between the White House and FBI regarding how to respond.In addition, the author glossed over the rampant corruption in Russia and how the administration failed to hold senior Russian officials, to include former PM Viktor Chernomyrdin accountable. Al Gore worked closely with Chernomyrdin, and their lackluster ability to reorient the Russian economy reinforced critics' claims that Clinton more about propping up corrupt regimes to score political points than in providing a long-term vision."
3,Lily was better!,"This book was a HUGE let-down to me after reading Lily. I was so excited to see that the sequel was FINALLY out, I could't wait to read it, then was sadly disappointed. It was still a good story, but not nearly as good as Lily."
4,This book is definitely not as good as Lily.,"""Looking After Lily"" is a good book, but I think that ""Lily"" is a much better book. ""Looking After Lily"" seems like it wants to be more like ""Lily"". Marion and Lily fell completely in-love and that was something meant to be. They are so in-love, and for Lily to even think that Haywood is a comparison to Marion is very disturbing to me. I think that it was an outstanding book, but it definitely shouldn't have been a sequel. There are times in the book where it just draggs on, parts where it is very slow. The only question I can ask is, What sequel is better than the first novel?"
4,Interesting,"My Dad commented that he missed watching Johnny Carson on the Tonight Show, and never having any idea what to buy him for gifts, I purchased this. Although it is a very interesting dvd, it just wasn't what I expected (or Dad wanted). I guess in the rush of holiday shopping, I neglected to read the description, and the reviews, very closely. This is not a collection of clips from his shows, it is a bio of Johnny. As I said, interesting, just not exactly what was wanted in this particular case."
5,Carson was king,"Watched this on PBS and it was very good. It is the true mark of a person when, after they are dead, you don't hear too many people saying bad things about you. It's nice to see Leno, Letterman, Carey and so on say what a career booster it was to get Johnny's approval. It was also nice to hear Joan Rivers admit that she was a low class traitor (my words not hers) for betraying Johnny. The only person I have ever heard say anything bad about Carson was Wayne Newton. And I guess there, you have to consider the source. Can't wait to buy this DVD when it becomes available."
5,Carson ... and all of his flaws.,"Honest portrait of Carson ... shows him to be uniquely talented, and uniquely flawed. Its not a ""Tonight Show"" highlight film, and is a great documentary of an important piece of television history."
4,Scholarly review,"The other reviewers seem to have misunderstood this book. It is not intended to be a gripping crime drama. It is a scholarly work based on interviews with ""advantaged offenders"" incarcerated in New York State prisons. As such, it represents an interesting contribution to the field of criminal justice. Most interesting are the vignettes or excerpts from intensive interviews with these prisoners as they discribe prison life in their own words."
1,Waste of Time and Money!!,"This book was a dry read. There were numerous sections that were tough to comprehend and follow. It also seems as though the author did very little ground breaking and merely cited other author's works to prove her point. All in all, I found this book to be a waste of money and time. If your looking for the information found in this piece of literature, I reccommend not wasting your money on this book but rather finding other, more well-written works."
1,"This book is terrible, when explaining life behind the wall!",The author didn't hold a good story line and seemed to have just quoted and sited other books and authors. It is definetly not worth the money or reading effort!
4,Comparison Sparrow Hawk Red & Rescue Josh Migure,"Sparrow Hawk Red and Rescue Josh Migure are two book written by the same author, Ben Miachelsen. These two books are both very alike and they both have suspense surprise and excitement. Saving josh migure is about a boy that will go to all lengths to save a bear cub, and sparrow hawk red is about is about a boy that has left home and headed for mexico to steal back a plane that has to do with a major drug opperation. These both are very alkie. These are two books that i stongly reccomend both of these books."
4,Ricky/Soledad belong together,Sparrow Hawk Red is an adventurous story. Ricky Diaz learns that drug smugglers killed his mother. He runs away to Mexico to get revenge. Ricky plans on stealing a bi-plane from the drug cartel and flying it back to the U.S.A. After he gets there Ricky experiences many difficulties. A girl named Soledad becomes his friend. Soledad tries to get Ricky to realize that his idea of stealing the plan is a death wish. If you want to know more about Ricky's and Soledad's adventures you should read this book.It will make you hungry for more. Studio A!!!!
5,this book is the best book I've ever read,"My ten year old loved this book and is asking for more by this author.10 year old kid review: ""I've never read a book with so much adventure. I think it's the best of the best when he steals the airplane. I also like how there's a lot of Spanish in the book, so I've been learning a little bit of Spanish. I also like how he steals the agents lunch and locks all the car doors."""
5,Terrific Resource -- An Oldie And a Goodie,"Zondervan came out with this book in 1967 and it remains popular today. For obvious reasons.Edited by Vaugan, backed up by a team of over a dozen editors, this book provides the King James translation in bold and then provides variants from a host of other translations including the Revised Standard Version, the American Standard Version, the New English Bible, Berkeley, Eastern Texts (Lamsa), Living Letters, Modern Speech (Weymouth), and many more. The book does NOT give variants from all 26 translations for every verse. This would make for a pretty long book. Instead Vaughn, et al. choose those translations which shed interpretative light.Hardback, with dustjacket, cloth over hardback boards, 1237 pp."
4,Excellent Resource,"An excellent book to help get a different perspective on Bible verses. The book has each verse in the KJV, then a selection of 2-4 alternative trnaslations from a selection of 26."
1,Horrible heart rate monitor.,"This monitor is good value for a Heart rate monitor that is very difficult to get to listen to your heart rate. I have tried to get to use it for 2 weeks and just gave up on it. It seems that the strap has to be in an exact position and when you move, run, jump, sit or do anything other then stand still it stops reading the heart rate.Would not recommend this to anyone."
4,Can't Beat It For The Price,"Omron HR-100C Heart Rate MonitorI was looking for an inexpensive heart rate monitor to use when walking and/or bicycling at home when I finished cardiac rehab. I purchased the Omron for about $30 and it works great for what I needed it to do. I actually wore it to rehab a few times to check it for accuracy and it was very close at my resting pulse rate and my maximum cardiac rehab pulse rate. At rehab, everyone exercises while they are attached to a portable EKG monitor plus you are checked by the staff periodically for your blood pressure and with a pulse/oxygen monitor. The Omron HR-100C was close enough that I feel comfortable relying on it when I exercise at home trying to keep my heart rate in the target pulse rate for cardiovascular strenghtening. Getcha one....I'm glad I did."
4,Excellent product but with little problem,Omron HR-100C Heart Rate MonitorThe product is good but the sound of the heart rate alarm is very low.
3,NOT Water resistant,"Live and learn. This product says it is water resistant, but within 10 seconds in the water it was toast. On dry land, the product worked as advertised. However, the chest strap was too large, even on the smallest adjustment, and kept slipping down while I ran (I may be petite, but the measurements stated made it look like this would fit me)."
5,So useful!,Cardio at the gym used to be a real pain: whenever I'd try to measure my heart rate by holding onto those metal bars I'd forget to keep running and fall off the treadmill. I know fitness is supposed to hurt but it was getting ridiculous! Thanks to this little device I can keep track of my heart rate and the only embarrassment I feel now is the chest strap that makes it look like I'm wearing a bra.
4,Does a great job most of the time!,"I recently bought the heart rate monitor, as I'm experimenting with the P90X cardio workouts. I first looked at heart rate monitors at a popular department store. I about fell over when I saw that the price range went from $58 on the low end all the way up to a whopping $92! That's when I made the decision to look on Amazon.com.The Omron Heart Rate Monitor usually performs as promised, doing exactly what I need it to do (ie, letting me know when I'm either in my target range, above it or below it). My only complaint is that occasionally it blanks out and shows just a '0' for 30 to 60 seconds when it's supposed to be showing me my heartrate. It does this 3 or 4 times during each 60-minute workout, but it always bounces back and shows my heartrate again within a minute or so. Other than that little glitch, I'm very pleased with the product and with it's low price!"
2,too much interference with gym machines and other HRMs,"Works great when there aren't other HRMs or electric gym equipment around, however there is a lot of interference in a workout room. Since I work out primarily in a gym this didn't work for me, I would get readings that were +/- 60 bpm from one second to the next. I am returning it and buying an HRM with a coded transmitter/receiver. On the positive side the watch is very functional and gets the job done for someone looking for a simple HRM without a lot of bells and whistles. I am a pretty big guy and had no problems getting the chest strap to fit."
5,Wonderful product,"After reading several of the previous reviews, I decided to give this HR monitor a try. It was a great decision. I find myself working harder at the gym. I've always wetted the sensors per instructions and have yet to have a problem with it working. It works perfectly with the gym equipment! No more trying to hold the sensors while running on the treadmill. Yipee! It doesn't have all the features of more expensive monitors but for someone like me that just wants to stay in the correct zone for a great workout, it's perfect."
4,Simple and dependable,"What you see is what you get. It's simple to set up with straight forward functions. It has no real bells and whistles, but it does what it's suppose to do. Report your heart rate."
4,Omron HR-100C Heart Rate Monitor,"This product does exactly what it says it will do and at a very reasonable price. The chest strap transmitter is reasonably comfortable. In addition to transmitting to the watch/receiver most cardio machines in my local gym are also compatible with its signal (exercise bike, treadmill, rowing machine, stair walker, and elliptical). This is particularly welcome as it frees up my hands from the cardio machine sensor pads and lets me concentrate more on the workout. The watch is a no frills receiver that also has basic functions such as time, date, alarm, and stopwatch as well as blue-light. In short, there were no surprises - an excellent value."
5,heart rate monitor works great esp for the price,works like a charm. the strap goes around your chest and transmits your heart rate to the wrist watch. very helpful when doing cardio workouts. the chest strap really doesnt feel that different esp for girls (i just put it under the bottom of my sports bra so i dont even feel a difference)
4,great product,"simple but it works, I haven't had too much interference in my gym where many others wear a heart rate monitor. I had no idea what a great tool it wold be to use while working out (I spin mostly) and for $30.00 its a no brainer."
4,Great monitor,This basic monitor works very well. I like the red button feature that lets me check time and then easily return to heart rate.
5,"Easy, Accurate, Reliable","I purchased theOmron HR-100C Heart Rate Monitorfor use during my rowing workouts and am delighted with the purchase. I have found it to be accurate and reliable throughout my workout. The ability to easily attach the display to the rowing machine, alongside its built in computer, is great as it makes it much easier to monitor than it would be on my wrist.Unlike some reviewers I have found that it only requires a small amount of water on the sensor to get a good reading. Simply wiping a wet finger once over each side is sufficient."
1,Never got it to fit my needs,"I am fairly tech savy, but this one threw me for a loop. I consider this monitor user UNfriendly. I never was able to get to the point where I could monitor my heart rate for more than just a few minutes. I think my monitor was probably defective...it was hard to tell because it seemed much more complicated than it needed to be.I have great praise for Amazon because of the ease of returning this item...a truly great company with excellent customer service."
3,Omron Heart Monitor,I like it. It is easy to use with one exception...the backlight causes the numbers to fade away. So you can not look at your watch in the dark that is probably the biggest flaw in the watch.
2,Range Description is grossly innaccurate,"My gripe with this product is the Amazon description states the range for the monitor is 98 feet from the sensor, when in fact the owners manual states the range is only 20 inches. That's quite a disparity! The 20 inches seemed to be pretty accurate too! The monitor worked OK when on my wrist (within 20""), but I preferred to have it attached to my eliptical machine using the included attachment but that put it about 26"" from the sensor and the monitor stopped working. Also the senors need to be constantly wet so the manual recommends using contact jelly which I didn't have and seemed to me an inconvenience. All in all I was disappointed with the performance and felt it did not perform as advertised. I returned it and am looking to try a different brand, perhaps Timex."
3,"Decent for the price, but HRM starting acting up!","I purchased this heart rate monitor watch to monitor my heart rate while mountain biking. It worked great (for a no frills product) on the first three 1.75 hour rides but then the next few rides it started giving random heart rate readings. I tried re-moistening the contacts, repositioning the strap and swapping the batteries. Nothing seemed to work. Sometimes the heart rate would read about half of the estimated actual, other times it would just drop to zero. It was extremely hot and I was totally covered in sweat but not much sweatier than the first few times when it was working fine. As far as initial set-up, it was straight forward and it only took about 7-9 minutes using the owne's manual. I returned it for the Timex model that sells for about $55 on Amazon.com and so far it is more than worth the $20 difference in price."
1,Suddenly Quite After One Month,"I bought this HRM and was pleased with its function for the first month. As others noted, its monitoring during the first ten minutes of exercise is unreliable. After that, it did exactly what it advertised. However, the HRM suddenly failed to pick up the signal from the chest strap after one month. Replacing the battery did not help. While its price makes this HRM very attractive, buying copies of to mitigate product failure will quickly add up to the price of a Polar or Garmin HRM.I simply wish it had kept working."
1,inaccurate,"this one is very inaccurate, and I have requested an exchange. Would like to give it another try."
2,Omron Heart Rate Review,"I purchased this product to make my aerobic workouts more effective. It has been perfect for that. It was easy to set-up, reasonably priced, and easy to use. It was a perfect combination of price and function for how I wanted to use it. REVISED OPINION. The chest strap broke right where it enters the monitor device and is therefore impossible to fix or to use. I always used the supplied storage bag and never bent the strap to an extreme angle so I can not understand why it broke. This happened after only six months of use. Because of this, I would NOT recommend this product for that reason"
2,Died after eating through batteries.,"I bought this about 6 months ago and it died. It all started about 2 days after i bought it. Whenever i would hit the big button to turn on the light on the watch it would make the numbers impossible to see. I thought it was a normal reaction to dying batteries, so i replaced them (I had just received the watch). That seemed to fix the problem for about 1 week. then it started to get worse and worse. I replaced the battery 2 more times (making this bargain watch less bargain). Then yesterday it died completely when i tried to turn on the light on the watch. I will go with a polar next time. it may be more expensive, but my friends who have them are still using them while i am burying mine in the back yard in a solemn ceremony tonight. 'Ave Maria'"
5,Possibly the best out there!,"Excellent product, but a bit tricky to set up, but once you have it set it is VERY accurate!"
4,Heart Rate Monitor,I was happy with the monitor. It's measurements were consistent and stable. I was surprised that it also was a wrist watch.
2,Not so Great,"After about a month's worth of use this monitor seemed like a good, entry-level monitor. It worked well with all of the machines at the gym with built-in heart rate receivers. However, after a couple months of use (4-6 times/week) the watch gradually lost its ability to receive the heart-rate signal. The chest strap and monitor itself continued to work because I could see the output on the Precor machines displays. I'd say pay a little more and get something more reliable. I'm having to send this one into Omron for service."
2,Happy at first... not happy after a couple weeks,"The monitor's features seem to work well out of the box, put on the strap, check your heart rate on the watch and you'll see the little heart icon flashing so you know its reading your rate. This works fine in my apartment, but the instant I step outside ready to run, the icon stops flashing. Instead of updating my heart rate to the second, it seemed random now.I'm guessing wifi routers around the area are interfering with it, that's the only thing I can think of. The second I go back into my apartment, it works great again. Very annoying, and not good for you if you're trying to keep within a specific range during your run. Maybe if you're in a gym it would be fine, but urban areas will probably have the problem I'm having."
5,Great Heart Rate Monitor,"You can:1. use it while running2. monitor your workouts at home or in the gym3. take it with you in the pool!This thing is great and has been VITAL to my losing weight. I've been ""over-exercising"" for the past several years and this device (along with general reading and workout tips online) have helped me devise custom workouts that target my body fat resulting in over 10% reduction in overall body fat.Highly recommended."
3,Good when it works,"This heart rate monitor has some cool features such as it will let you know when you are not in the range you want to be in, tells time, has a timer, etc. The only downside I've experienced is that it doesn't always register. It may be user error though. I have to mess with it a bit more."
3,hr monitor,"this heart rate monitor is a little restrited it do,s not give the highest hr or the lowest i couldnt get the modes working with ease and the hr alarmis too quite to be of any use"
3,Bogus product feature claims,"The write-up on this device claims the sensor can transmit data up to 98 feet or 30 meters to the ""watch"". That is nonsense and countered by the product manual included. In fact it transmits a distance less than average for these devices, just 20 inches.I bought this because I wanted it for my research lab where human subjects are asked to exercise to exhaustion. The long transmit distance would have been nice for my work because I am not interested in these animals watching their own data.In the manufacturer's defense, these devices generally have a very short range for a reason. Especially in cycling where athletes are closely packed, you wouldn't want your watch picking up someone else's signal and giving you erroneous information.None the less, we are back to, ""doesn't do what it said it would"".I'll keep it because sending it back is more hassle than its worth. I will be back after using it for a while if it has any other shortcomings."
1,didn't work from the beginning,"I could never get the heart rate function to be reliable. Most of the time it read zero.After calling within the warranty period, they told me to replace both the battery and chest strap batteries (at my own expense!) Their explanation? ""We ship the units with run down batteries which often need to be changed quickly.'By the way, you can't easily change the watch battery so it needs a watch repair person and $25.Anyway, that didn't help and I finally got around to calling again, only to find out that in the interim the warranty had run out and I couldn't get a repair or replacement under warranty. Not what I call enlightened customer service."
2,Just fine. And then it died,"This worked just fine for 45 days. Then it died, too late to return to Amazon. Replacing the battery did nothing."
5,Good product for a good price,"This is a good, simple, heart rate monitor without additional bells and whistles that I probably wouldn't use anyway. It was shipped quickly and the price was the best I have seen, including at local stores. I have used it frequently to transmit my heart rate on the machines at the Y. I have had no problems or issues with it. I am completely happy with my purchase."
1,Disappointed,"Product came with dead batteries. Customer services said they come with minimum charge, told me to buy batteries and change them. Then they told me to take product to jeweller to have it installed to complete the seal. Customer service was uninformed and then defensive. I would have rather paid more money and received a product that worked without the hassle."
1,"Good price, but doesn't work","I was drawn in by the price, and figured I'd take a chance since the reviews were about 50/50.The product does not work as many other reviewers stated. My heart rate would read wacky and varied at rest and zero during exercise. And I'm fairly certain that I do have a heartbeat.I thought it was worth the risk given the low cost. Amazon rocks as usual with returns of unworthy products, however just know going in that you'll likely end up sending it back. In the end, it was just a big waste of my time and effort.Despite the huge cost difference, I'll be moving to the Polar brand (which my boot camp instructor recommends).Because no matter how cheap you can get something, it's worth nothing if it doesn't work."
1,"Functioned for two sessions, then kaput!","OK, I read the manual and set up the receiver. My first treadmill session everything was functioning fine. My treadmill has a built-in Polar HR receiver which was also reading the Omron transmitter, an added bonus! Session two, the Omron receiver (watch) became erratic, then stopped altogether. My treadmill was still receiving the transmitter (chest strap) just fine, so no problems there. I might have been satisfied with just the chest strap for the price, but it becomes worthless when I step off the treadmill to continue my workout. It's going back next week. I'll probably bite the bullet and spring for one of the Polar products!"
3,displeases,Product is definitely not user friendly. Operating instructions are not very useful I will not recommend this product to anybody. When it functions I have reasons to believe that its readings are not very accurate. If it were possible I would like to have my money back.I fully agree with the above review specially with the product not being user friendly.
3,Heart Monitor,"I am somewhat disappointed with this product because it seems to be taking in water whenever I go into a pool. This doesn't seem to be affecting its operation, but the screen fogs up until the moisture evaporates. It's supposed to be water resistant; the pool is only 5 feet deep."
1,AVOID THIS PRODUCT!,Not only were both batteries dead when I received it...but it didn't work! It would not keep my heart rate! Had to return it! My suggestion: DO NOT PURCHASE THIS!
1,Flatliner,"As other reviewers have noted, it takes a loooooong time before the monitor even begins reading a pulse, no matter how much spit or sweat or gel you use. Worse, it died completely after about a dozen bike rides despite impact free use, careful cleaning and storing after every outing. I would not recommend this product."
1,"If you don't sweat a good deal, this product won't work for you","First off, the setting up of the watch is not very intuitive and I've had my share of digital watches. The light button was stuck and often didn't work. For the first and only workout, I tried it first without wetting the strap. No reading. Then I wet it. Success...for less than a minute. It dried up fairly quickly. It takes a lot to get me to sweat. I wet it again. Success again but only for a moment before it dried up again. The watch also reset itself during my first workout. Maybe a defective one. I had to return this product. My suggestion, unless Amazon is offering $10 with the refund, it's not worth the time and effort to see for yourself."
2,Just OKAY,"This unit seems to pickup my heart rate pretty readly once I wear the chest belt but the display unit seems to drop the signal if it is more than 1.5 feet from the sending unit.Also the heart rate seems to go all over the spectrum at times(sometimes the reading will be 40 and the next moment at 220)so I'm not too sure about the acuracy when it's not fluctuating.But this helps me get an overall idea of the heart rate so I can keep it in the target range.For the price, this is an okay device if you're not picky about the acuracy."
3,I like it but...,"Pros:- nice looking- simple to use- easy to follow instruction manual- you can replace the battery in the chest strapCons:- no calorie countIf you don't care how many calories you burned, get it. I will be returning mine as it is the reason why I purchased the HRM in the first place."
4,Very good product,Wasn't sure what to expect - did not like the idea of having to wear the band BUT turns out it is very comfortable - forget I even have it on. I think my sports bra helps to keep it in place. I love the fact that the monitor synchs up with the display on the treadmill and elliptical so there's no need to keep looking at the watch band.
3,Heart Rate Monitor,"Really like this monitor, works well and was fairly easy to set. It would have been good to know that it only works with the chest strap and wished it was a wrist only device. Believe it is better suited for men."
3,Good basic monitor,"I had heart surgery a few months ago and wanted to keep track of my heart rate during exercise. This is just for myself, the docs never said anything about it. While I do work out at the gym, I am more interested in my heart rate for outside activities--mostly hiking and biking.I found this to be a good basic monitor, which is all I want. You are supposed to moisten the sensor on the chest strap, but I find that because it is plastic I start sweating under it right away so that's not an issue. I feels a little odd at first to wear that thing around my chest, but I forget about it pretty quickly. It seems to keep accurate readings. I do find that if wearing it while driving to the trailhead it gives off odd readings (e.g., 0 or 150). I assume this is from interference with some electronics in the car. Once away from that interference, it works very well. This monitor works just fine for my purposes."
5,Heart rate monitor,Works great for my husband who need to keep track of his heart rate. It is very easy to read
3,Inexpensive Heart Rate Monitor,"The Omron does all that its description states, it just takes a little while to ""warm up"" for the BPM display. Overall a suitable piece of equipment...unless you need an accurate heart rate reading at the beginning of an exercise session."
4,"I really like it, but it does not work for everyone","I bought monitor for my husband, who could not use it because it fluctuated erratically. Monitor works for me, provided I put a lot of water under the straps. It's really useful to know about the ""training zones"" and use the monitor. Now, I'm able to tailor workout to ""achieve the maximum health benefits..."" and avoid unhealthy levels of exercise. I very much like the monitor and recommend it, with caveat that it does not work for everyone. Because of latter and the large amounts of water needed under straps, I did not give monitor five stars."
5,Wow - Great price and very accurate,"I am very pleased with this purchase.1) The chest strap is so comfortable you just hardly feel it after a few minutes. Once you figured out the best location, it's easy to get it back into the same place the next time.2) Upper and lower limit alarm is very easy to set. The alarm does not have a vibrate function (hence the low price), but it is loud enough that I can hear it over my treadmill.3) I checked this against my stationary pressure/heart rate machine, and the readings where EXACTLY the same. I tried this 10 times, with various levels of excercise, and it read the exact same value 9 times, with the 10th being only one off (114 vs 113). My stationary is also an Omron.I would still call this an incredible monitor at a much higher price!"
3,Just okay,"I couldn't decide on what brand of HRM I wanted so I went with one of the cheapest priced I could find and figured I'd start there. Yes, you have to wet the chest strap and yes, it has to be pretty wet or you won't get a good reading.When I run around the track it takes a long time to get a reading and it goes in and out. It seems to work with the Pre-cor machines so I don't have to hold the machine's built-in HRM. I wish the time and HR were on one display because I use the watch to time myself between sets so I have to constantly switch back and forth between watch and HRM settings.It's fine if you don't mind the negative info I listed, but I would opt for something a little better."
4,Works without problem,"Bought this for use while on my treadmill and it works better than expected in that the treadmill also picks up the signal and displays the pulse rate (one that came with the treadmill had quit working). Can't really comment on the watch/pulse readout that comes with it as I've not used it. I did look at it and it did display the pulse rate, but I normally ignore it. The watch and treadmill displays matched, so while it doesn't verify accuracy, at least they both pick up the same. If you use a Landice Pro Trainer, it will replace the pulse band that comes with the Landice.I've had no trouble with it picking up the pulse rate, though without some moisture you have to wait for a bit of sweat to close the circuit. I just lick my finger and moisten the back (gross, I know) and it picks up right away.Does what it is supposed to do, can't complain at all."
5,happy,"am 68,over weight and out of shape ! am trying to change this. needed a easy and clear readying heart monator . took this unit for a spin sunday . we hiked 4.5 miles along a stream ( round trip )with hills and flat groud . i was able to program ( easy ) my high and low heart rate alarms and belive me , this unit preformed outstandingly. even recommended it to my friend downstairs. my choice of the omron hr-100c was a good one. jim"
3,It works...,"After 10 one-hour exercise sessions, the HR-100C has been reliable. However, there have been occasions lasting up to five minutes when the heart rate doesn't seem to ""register."" Then it will suddenly appear. I am uncertain of the cause. Otherwise, it has been dependable."
4,Delivers what is promises - beware after 1 Year,"This is definitely a no-frills heart rate monitor. But so far it has performed excellently the 2 things it does promise (heart rate and time).The only downer so far is range. When I am swimming my wrist goes beyond the range of the transmitter signal. So, it's not that much use while swimming.It has done fine during running and cycling. I would spring for a more expensive product if your budget can handle it and you need to use it for swimming. Otherwise - this serves really well.03/08 - UpdateI just replaced the battery, took it to the pool for my swim. It immediately filled with water. It's completely ruined. Not sure whether it was my fault when I replaced the battery - or the fault of the product for not holding a seal after 1 year. Either way - no more heart rate monitor.No other complaints. Worked great for 1 year."
2,Battery dead.......,"When I got this product the battery was dead. Then I replaced it. Now it is dead again, 1.5 month after I replaced the battery. I think this one is defective. When it works it works fine."
2,Not Enough Functions,The unit is very accurate but is a Heart Rate Monitor only and has no other useful functions. I would not reccomned it.
2,Wouldn't buy it again....,"I presently own a Polar Chest Strap monitor and thought it would be a good idea to get an additional monitor to carry in my gym bag as a tend to lose things.The difference between the two monitors is night and day in a bad way. With this model I cannot:1. Track my average heart rate over a workout2. Track the calories burned in my workout3. Look at the continuous and heart rate at the same time (split screen)4. Easily slip between modes5. Enter height, weight and fitness level for an accurate calorie count.I can do all of these things with my Polar monitor. This model is useful to me only as a glorified watch."
2,Omron HR-100C Heart Rate Monitor,"The monitor works really well. The functions are a bit limited from the perspective of calorie counting and fitness tracking.If you are looking for a good basic monitor, this is a great unit."
2,Not Strapless,"Was disappointed when the product arrived with a strap. Admittedly, I should have read more carefully, but the picture does not clearly show the strap (I thought it was a horizontal view of the watch-like heart rate monitor). Perhaps the product title should contain mention of the strapAmazon was great at having me return the item with the usual fees."
1,Inexpensive heart monitor that works,"I like this product a lot. It's easy to use, seems quite accurate, and is inexpensive."
2,Intermittent action,"I purchased the HRM even though a few of the reviews complained about intermittent function under different conditions. I also found that I couldn't rely on its readings when engaged in high intensity activity. I assumed that the lower price was due to the limited funtionality but found that it also had some reliability issues- one doesn't want erronious reading on a HRM. The device worked fine when walking, biking or using the elliptical up to about 135-140 bps. Above that intensity it started to double the reading and jump all around and then quit altogether. I could manually check my HR and find that it was where it shold be. I could also compare it to the HRM on the bike and elliptical machine. Running seemed to be the worst, and I think it might be trying to count footfalls when running fast. I don't know the funtion of this device but if it is sensitive to that type of shock it could be the issue. I returned it and am still looking for a more reliable device."
5,My review,"I love this heart rate monitor. It is very accurate. You can't beat the price. The chest strap transmitter is very comfortable. I use it to monitor / gauge my cardio workouts on my stationary bicycle. I wish I had this thing 20 years ago when I was an avid runner but advanced age and some knee problems make running impossible anymore. I highly recommend this HRM to anyone seeking an affordable solution for monitoring their heart rates during their cardio workouts. My resting HR is about 58 BPM. I am 50 years old. When I do my cardio, I like to get my HR up to around 120 BPM and keep it there for 20-30 minutes. Thanks Amazon. Good product."
5,Reliable product,"I have been using this monitor for the whole Summer of 2011 and it has not fail me. So far this item is reliable. I like the way that it came with a rubber mount for the bike because that was the first thing I did for this item was mounting it to my road bike. The rubber mount has also helped absorb the vibration of my front tire bike from road biking. Very easy to mount and easily turn for viewing angle while riding. My friends who have bought their own monitors from somewhere else paid so much more and did not even come with a bike mount. So, they were very surprised when I showed this item to them."
4,Good product,"I tested this hr monitor and it works, I still don't like having that strap around my chest. It's easy to set up. it's basically a watch with a heart monitor in it. I like it. the only complaint is having that strap on my chest."
1,Poor design,The unit was returned because it was susceptible to radio frequency interference. It would go blank at street lights and interference from a car.
1,"Works great when it works, which isn't long.","I bought this monitor to get a better sense of my workouts. It worked reasonably well for several months, and then stopped detecting my heart rate. Cleaned it, carefully. Changed the battery. Tried again. No luck. This is a very poorly made product and I cannot in good faith recommend it."
5,I'm impressed,"I do not write reviews, but this item deserves a review. I went through about five Timex HRMs before this one and they barely lasted one year, then I decided to buy this one. I thought at this price I could afford to buy one every year. This monitor doesn't have a lot of features, but it's a $30 item! I looked at a couple of the one star ratings on this watch that say it has a hard time locking on to your heart rate, this may be true to an extent, but you just need to give it that 5-7 minutes in warm up to become accurate. It will work great as soon as your heart, and it, is warmed up. I've found all monitors to be like this.The main reason I'm writing this review is that I've been training with this monitor for the last THREE years 4-6 times per week for nine months out of the year and this monitor is as good as it was when I got it, and I'll get another when this one decides it doesn't want to work any more."
5,Cost Effective Heart Rate Monitor,"Bang for the buck. i was originally hesitant on this due to some reviews and cost (old saying you get what you pay for). This device works like a charm since I've had it, and you can also replace the batteries on both devices needs be. The actual monitor can be used on any excercise equipment that has the monitor reader built in without any configurations (so you don't need to use the watch if the equipment already has it)."
5,"Works perfectly, a tremendous value.","This device worked perfectly right out of the box. I have had problems with a Polar monitor in the past. It often didn't sense my heartbeat. This Omron worked as soon as I put it on. I have used it in the gym now for about a week, and it has been flawless. The wrist receiver picks up the signals perfectly - which is necessary for runners. But, it also is picked up automatically by all the cardio machines in my gym.I would highly recommend this product."
2,Doesn't Fit Small Women,"Neither the heart rate chest strap nor the watch fit me. I'm 5 feet 2 inches and 110 lb. My chest size is between 32"" and 34"". The watch has to go half way up my arm on the smallest setting not to flop around and it doesn't stay there. The chest strap falls down when I jump/run because, again, it's too big on the smallest setting. I understand that they can't make one size to fit everyone but I was disappointed that it didn't come close to working for me. The watch and monitor work as described but that does me little good since they don't fit."
1,Highly Inaccurate,"I used to have Polar hear rate monitor, but decided to try this one since it was only around 35 dollars. (So I know how to use one correctly.) Unfortunately, the heart rate portion is highly inaccurate. It often doesn't read my heart rate at all, and when it does is hit and miss. Sometimes it only is reading every other heart beat, so it will read ""85 bpm"" when it's really around 150, and then for a minute or two it will be accurate.I really wanted this to work, but sorry to say I wouldn't recommend that anyone buy this product for the heart rate monitor portion. I would stick to the Polar heart rate monitors; they were more expensive but they worked like a charm."
1,Two units were dead on arrival,"I bought one of these and when it arrived the watch display was very dim. It looked like a low battery. By the time I set the date and time it was totally dead. Ordered a replacement from Amazon and it suffered the same fate. You could tell it was going out because the display was getting lighter and lighter, finally fading to white. I requested a refund. I think the batteries are bad (probably old) but it could be something more.Omron HR-100C Heart Rate Monitor"
3,Omron HR-100C heart Monitor,"This watch is OK, It not the best thing you can have. easy to work with but it looks like a cheap kid's watch. I hope this is helpful."
4,works like it is supposed to,This is the first monitor I have ever bought. I found it easy to use and have had no problems with is so far - but have only used for about a week. The price was definitely right. Im curious to see if it will last though - as there are many reviewers whose monitor stopped working fairly early on.
2,Does not work in pool,I bought this for swimming and it will not keep a heart rate measure when in the pool despite saying it works in water.
3,Heartbeat,I find that this model is set up to give you too much information and the controls are very difficult to work. However I only purchased it for the single purpose of monitoring my pulse and this function it does extremely well. A good buy for single purpose.
5,heart rate monitor,"I am an older road biker and have been climbing some long hills. I was concerned about my heart rate.I didn't want to die trying to stay healthy.The Omron HR-100C had good reviews and was well priced. I like the mounting bracket that fits nicely on the handlebar. I've been using it now for a couple of weeks and it works pefectly. I wet the heart sensers for good contact. This might not be necessary because i'm sweating after awhile anyway.By the way my heart rate tops out at 140, so I guess I'll keep on living."
3,Hope it lasts!!,This is a great product while it works. I use it on my bicycle as it comes with a neat handlebar mount. The first one I bought died just after the warranty and Omron refused to do anything. Fortunately me credit card company refunded my money and I bought this one. I hope I can get more then a year of use.
4,Good for the price,This is a simple heart rate monitor that is great for the price. It's not fancy and is really easy to use.
3,Useful but lasted only one week.,"NIce device and useful to me, but the watch case broke after a week under only light use. The plastic was defective."
5,Works well,"This works well and accurately, all without having to pay the big bucks.A note for the other reviewers who had trouble getting it to work... The conductors are on the rubber strap, not the plastic box. You need to moisten the conductors."
3,Good Item,The Heart Rate Monitor has worked well for me. The strap that goes around your chest could be larger or adjusted a little better. It does send a signal from the monitor to your watch which allows you to see how fast you should walk.
2,disappointed,"I've had this device for less than 6 months, using it a few times a week. It has a lot of features that I don't need. What I would really like is to have the rate monitor and the time displayed at the same time. It doesn't do that. Secondly, for some reason, sometimes, it stops displaying the pulse rate and just shows zero. Other times, it is not accurate, showing a very low rate, even though I have been working strenuously and know it is higher. Lastly, the two tabs that lock on either side of the monitor on the chest strap have broken off, so I have to tie the chest strap on. I know the item wasn't that expensive, but it seems to me it should be more consistent. I'm envious of the rave reviewers' experiences."
4,works,"This was a great item, it worked very well and i enjoyed working out and running with it, however it didn't take many times of use before it busted, i may have used it 10-15 times, and the part that connects the center plastic piece to the elastic straps snapped on the inside, nothing can fix this, i wish i got more use out of it."
5,Absolutely love it!,"I checked online for a heart rate monitor for the better part of three months. Multiple websites placed this model in the top 10. I decided to pick it up since the price was very good. The fit of the watch/receiver is very comfortable and even fits my chubby wrists. The instructions are simple to follow and gets you up and running in no time. The monitor itself has an adjustable strap which helps get around my chest/upper abdomen area. The readings are quick and accurate. There is an attachment which comes with the set that is specifically for cyclists. The attachment allows you to place the receiver on the handlebars, thus keeping your hands off the button.I highly recommend it and hope everyone enjoys it as much as I have!"
1,Heart Rate Monitor,I purchased this product hoping to get everything it said and what was shown. It was not at all what I expected. It was not a watch and it was a bright yellow (not black) monitor-- it didn't even have a heart rate monitor on it at all. I spent a lot of money for a pedometer and stop watch which I could have bought somewhere else for a lot cheaper. It's the worst deal I have ever had on Amazon.
2,Ehh...,"Needed a heartrate monitor for P90X. This does not really work well. Strapping the sensor around your chest, which is not always accurate, and jumps around. I am sure if I follow their directions to a T it may work better, but I think I have and it still doesnt. (Moisten the conductivity pads on the chest strap). It is just annoying, and to be honest, I am learning that you get what you pay for. Get something nicer that reads the BPM right off your wrist instead of having an annoying strap around your chest."
2,Great Product,"Product is great! Exactly what I was looking for, and because I bought it on Amazon, it was less expensive!!! AAA++++"
1,GREAT WHILE WORKING,"Order Date: March 3, 2006I received the watch and it worked like a dream. Howevcr, it inexplicably stopped working on June 1st or 2nd. That is it works eratically and the heart rate monitor function works not at all.Exactly who do I complain to and how?????"
1,This is a POS,Ordered this for my girlfriend- When she opened the package it didn't even work. I found out that it's not what she wanted anyway because it doesn't even track calories. Bought a Polar FT7 instead
1,"WOW, WHAT A SHAME","THOUGHT THIS ONE WOULD BE OK FOR MY SIMPLE USE. I COULD NOT GET IT TO WORK. EVEN HAD FRIENDS TRY TOO, BUT NO GO. BATTERIES WERE OK. FINALLY BOUGHT ANOTHER MAKE THAT WORKED FINE, SO IT WAS NOT MY LACK FOLLOWING INSTRUCTIONS. AMAZON WAS VERY PROMPT WITH REFUND UPON RETURN. TOO BAD MANUFACTURER SENT POOR PRODUCT TO AMAZON. I BELIEVE THERE WERE SIMULAR REVIEWS TO THIS ONE."
4,R Boisjoly,"I was primarily looking for a heart monitor that #1 had replaceable batteries by me and also had a reasonable price. This product fits my requirements for exercising. This monitor may not be as accurate and quick to resond in as stable a manner as more expensive units but is sufficient for my needs. The response and stability I refer to is based upon the monitor sometimes fluctuating 3 to 4 BPM when I am doing my best to maintain a constant pace on my Nordic Trac aerobic exercise routine. However, as a senior citizen I am confident that such a small instability range is acceptable for exercising. I really liked the price the the replaceable battery features."
2,Strap didn't hold up,"I was generally happy with the monitor, but the plastic parts on the strap started breaking off after less than 10 uses. Didn't get more than two months use out of it before I couldn't keep the strap together with tape and safety pins. I also couldn't turn off the alarm after it was set."
2,Marginal Product,"I bought this product based on mostly good reviews written here. After using it for a few weeks I'm disappointed.First, it's erratic. The heart rate bounces around in a huge range.Second, it only gives a reading about half the time, and that reading is often so erratic it can't be believed. I know you have to moisten the sensor areas, but I've done that and it doesn't help much. In an intense workout where I'm sweating a lot, it gives a more consistent readout, but still not 100%. If I keep using it I'm going to have to buy some kind of lube to apply on the sensors so I can get a more consistent readout.Bottom line: I'm very disappointed in this purchase, and wish I'd spent a few dollars more to get something marginally decent."
1,"Unreliable, Strap Broke first week","bought this about a month ago on Amazon. The first time I wore it I noticed that it was unreliable. It will give you accurate heart rate for about 30 minutes but then it fluctuates within 50 points back and forth. It is not reliable. I bought this so that I could train within my target zone but with this piece of junk you do not know where your heart rate is at any given second. It jumps from 140 to 220 to 88 to 100 to 200. Also, the monitor part that straps to your chest broke the third time I wore it so now I've just thrown it in the trash and will buy another brand.."
5,AWESOME AMAZING BUY IT NOW!!!,"Are you kidding me I just realized I bought this thing over TWO YEARS AGO and I use it EVERY DAY for at least an hour and it hasn't even needed a battery!! Communicates perfectly with gym treadmills and all other cardio equipment, I was 278lbs with high blood pressure, type II diabetes, a 42"" waist, and 33% body fat. I just tell the machines I want 30 minutes at 85% (153 bpm) and you can vary the speed from run to walk the treadmill deck AUTOMATICALLY goes up and down to get you in the zone ASAP and keep you there and you NEVER feel like you are dying because the machine lowers the deck to keep you at the chosen rate! I owned tons of those useless strapless pulse takers, they DON'T WORK, they don't MONITOR your rate. THIS THING SAVED MY LIFE. GET ONE. and don't waste your money on stupid Polar. This Omron works flawlessly, reliably, and I can't say enough good things about it. Best money I ever spent."
1,Two strikes you're out.,I received my HR-100C and fresh out of the box the strap on the watch was broken. I sent it back and received the second HR-100C. I could not get a heart rate reading until I moved the transmiter around. The readings were all over the place. I called Omron and was told the transmiter was faulty. I wish there products were as good as there customer service.
1,Extremely Disappointed,"I only gave this heart moniter 1 star because it looks good. It worked fine until I was exercising, then it stopped. I tried it 3 times and each time was the same thing. I didn't know whether females need to wear it differently than men - the directions were NO help in this reqard. I wore it just under the bottom of the bra strap - directly under the breasts. If there's a better way, I don't know what it was. Wearing it above the breasts did not work at all."
5,Works Great.....,"I researched several models under $75 and this one looked to be the best to me. I'm totally satisfied. It's simple to use and works out of the box, easy to set up time and heart rate limits, and comfortable to wear, all at a reasonable price. I also like the bicycle handlebar mount for using when I ride my bike. I bought this because of its reasonable price. You won't be dissappointed...."
1,Didn't work well & the battery died too soon,"Well, I discovered why it didn't work very well. The battery in the watch died after just 4 weeks of use (about 15 workouts total). I know batteries die, but I just got the thing and the monitor's erratic behavior didn't win me over even if it was the battery. Not very happy with the product."
3,No achieve my expectations,"I've had some inconvenients with this HRM (Heart Rate Monitor). Firstable, I got to replace the battery of the receiver, because it had to low power, so it doesnt read appropiate the signal of the chest transmitter. Second one, in the spinning class, when I seat side someone who has other HRM ,this model start to get incongruent numbers. It become crazy. Start to get up the heart rate, and suddenly drop it. When I seat alone o away from someone with HRM, it works well."
5,accurate and easy to use.,"While wearing it during cardiac rehab on several occasions, I compared the heart rate on the display of this monitor against the heart rate that nurse's sophisticated instruments were showing. A perfect match. I think it is a great value."
1,Poor Craftsmanship,"Purchased this item after reading the good reviews. I wasn't expecting anything fancy for the price and the reviews which note this is a low end heart rate meter are accurate. There's not a lot to this meter, and it's not well built. My meter refused to pick up my heart rate even after going through the troubleshooting procedures and using a conductor on my skin. I triple checked the batteries and they were fine. On my last check of the battery in the transmitter band I noticed that the electrode meant to contact the battery was actually too far back in the plastic housing to touch the battery, so the unit wasn't getting any power. These meters might work well, mine was just so poorly assembled that I couldn't even try it out. I'm purchasing a similar product from a leading company to replace this."
4,"Nice for the price , but...............","It's a decent monitor which is simple to use. The problem I found was changing the watch battery. I've replaced the chest sending unit battery once and had no problem but changing the battery in the watch (receiver) was extremely difficult and if not done exactly right it won't function. I would advise anyone that if they are changing the receiver battery that they bring it to a professional watch repair shop, the internal part of the watch is very complex."
4,Accurate but takes forever,It takes about 7 minutes for this HRM to actually start working consistently and accurately. When it does start working it is pretty accurate. I always compare it to my own count and then the elliptical machines HRM.
3,Adequate but limited,"The Omron HR-100C is a good heart rate monitor and I like the features it offers especially the back light. I had expected rather more functions -- the option of setting up a workout time period and of retrieving the average and maximum heart rate achieved in that period. Ideally I would have liked an interface with Omron's Health Management Software on my PC -- but that may be asking too much given the price I paid. So my conclusion is that this item is good as far as it goes, but it doesn't go quite far enough."
5,Works great-simple,"This is simple and works just as it should. Even displays on our treadmills at the gym if they are ""heartrate monitor"" ready."
4,Great Heart Rate Monitor,"This is a great heart rate monitor. Only problem was that it is slightly too large for me. So if you are a woman, you may want to look at monitors made specifically for woman. However if I wear it under my sports bra, it seems to stay put. I've never used a heart rate monitor before so I don't have anything else to compare it with. I like this one though and think it's a good price too."
4,Omron HR-100C Heart Rate Monitor,"hey allplanning for a half marathon this august...got a Omron HR-100C Heart Rate Monitor.great easy readability...the manual is straight forward, easy to understand and small.Please wet the straps with some water...for fastest reading (10 seconds or less)good to keep track of your max heart rate...it had helped me to slow down when i am going beyond my max heart rating...THIS IS VERY important since before getting Omron HR-100C Heart Rate Monitor i would practice and run but never knew that i was going beyond my max heart rate..then I MEASURED IT AND IMPROVED ON GETTING ADDITIONAL INFO"
1,Unreliable at best,"For $32 along with a fair amount of great reviews, I was pretty excited about this heartrate monitor. But I found it worked only some of the time. When it wasn't giving a relistic reading, which was about half of the time, it just read ""0"". Not helpful at all.I exchanged it for another one (really pleased with Amazon actually how easy and fast that was) and the second one was worse than the first. It only managed a realistic reading a couple of times, mostly it read zero and once it read extremely high for the activity level which was a bit alarming. Very weird. Had to face the fact that it's pretty useless, return it, suck it up and pay more for a different model."
4,great for the price.,I think it works well. I started a new strenuous workout and it keeps me in my zone. I would recommend it to someone looking for a reasonable priced heart monitor.
1,Inaccurate and doesn't fit small wrists,"After using this heart rate monitor 3 - 4 times I have finally resorted to using the watch feature to determine my heart rate. When using the heart rate function, the beats per minute will fluctuate wildly then stay at one heart rate for over a minute then drop 50 beats immediately. It is completely unreliable which makes it pretty useless.Also, I have a pretty small wrist and the wrist band makes it hard to get a good fit. The wrist band is very stiff so when its a little too big, the face of the watch hangs off one side of the wrist or the other.However, the face of the heart rate monitor is very large which makes is really easy to read. The display is also clear and simple, displaying only the needed information. And, starting the heart rate feature is easy - just press the red button."
5,Great Product for the Price,This is the 2nd HRM I have purchased. The high/low HR functions have made my training much easier. It is easy to read and operate. Great Price and a Great Product. I definitely recommend it.
3,Barely adequate,"I had a Polar that I misplaced so I got this. It takes a while before registering my heart rate, and I'm don't think it is accurate - once it showed my heart rate at 57 while I was climbing the stairs, when that should be my 'at rest' rate, and I've been up for hours; when I monitor it closely while jogging it would ""jump"" around from ~ 90 to ~ 140 even when I was at the same 4 mph for over 5 mins.I just want to make sure I don't go over my max of 155 so it is good enough for now. I guess you get what you pay for"
4,Great Product,I have been using this heart monitor for a couple of weeks and I truly like it. It does keep track of your heartbeats while jogging or walking on the treadmill. I have had no problems with it.
3,worth the money,I got this because it was cheap and monitors the heart rate. It takes about a minute after you strap the belt to your chest to get the reading. Sometimes the heart rate it shows is not correct but after few seconds it does show correct heart rate. It works most of the time just fine. I think the link between belt and display watch should be more robust.
4,Very good deal,"I have had it for just over a month. I had by-pass surgery in June and my cardio-therapist recommended that I get a pulse monitor. This one had the best price. I am now going to the YMCA and some of the equipment has pulse monitoring built in. My monitor agrees most of the time with the built in monitors. Of course, I don't have any way to tell which is the most accurate. But my gut feeling is that the Omron is the closest. I would certainly recommend it."
2,Merely OK,"Sometimes it's right on, sometimes its measurements are pretty jumpy. By pretty jumpy I mean bouncing around within a 50 bpm range. I'm not sure why. I fiddled around with it and tested various levels of sking dampness under the chest strap. I eventually gave up and switched over to a Garmin unit which cost a lot more but is also far more accurate. Maybe the Omron deserves more than two stars, but it now sits in a drawer while I use something else to do the same job."
3,Great at first now readings are all over the place?,"I loved this for my first few bike rides. I commute to work and have a pretty intense (hilly) 12 mile ride. In the mornings my rates were between 120- 180...and then I was eventually was maxing-for a few seconds at the top of the largest hill- at 201 pbm (I am 5' 7"" and 165 lbs- female)....which I think was a off? Lately when I've used it for running it claims that I am between 60- 70pbm, which has to be way off. Perhaps my battery is dead? Also often times it stays at 0 for the first several minutes of my work-out too. I just can't figure out what is going on?"
3,Works OK - Not Great,The heart rate monitor works pretty good but the readings fluxuate quite a bit jumping from 125 to 150 then back without any noticable change in actual exertion.It's better than nothing and you just have to figure the most preponderant reading is the most nearly correct one.
1,total piece of junk,"this heart rate monitor did not work, it either gave me a crazy reading or none at all, I returned it and bought a Polar that works like a champ"
1,Battery DOA - twice,"Ordered once, battery dead in three days. Ordered second time, battery DOA. I suspect Amazon is selling very old stock. Device itself is probably fine without the battery problems but will never know for sure."
1,Wouldn't pick up signal for 10 minutes,I wet the sensor and it does not pick up the signal until after 10 minutes of sweating profusely. Not really practical. It's going back.
1,Omron HR monitor,"The multiple functions are NOT necessary. The so-called heart rate limits are unnecessary, confusiog, and clinically are of no use. Please, just the HR and seconds together."
2,Transmitter (chest) strap poor construction,"The HR100C monitor (wrist watch) was a little difficult to read but otherwise worked ok most of the time. It was used for Nordic track (ski) machine workouts, roughly 100 sessions X 30 minutes each. The transmitter was always under my shirt (no rough treatment) and after 14 months of use, the plastic strap and its embedded electrical wires parted where the strap meets the wider part holding the battery. I informed Omron of the defect but they cited it was 2 months over the one year warranty; the representative declined to repair or even offer a discount on a new unit-despite extraordinary failure. Last Omron product for me!"
2,Marginal At Best,"Although worked fine when not working out, was very inconsistent when working out, kept losing its signal apparently. I guess you get what you pay for."
2,Kind of bulky and problematic,"It wasn't clear to me at first, but this device takes its reading from a plastic device you have to put across your heart, then it transmits a signal to the wristband. Working out with the device in place is a modest hassle, plus you have to either moisten it or lick it on the back so it gets decent contact with your skin.. if you got dry skin or in a dry climate you find yourself pushing or figeting with it to get a reading.If I decide to get a device that can reliably take pulse from the arm it's strapped on, i'd go that route. This one is only doable if you plan on stopping, then mashing down on or holding the sensor on your chest, and doing static readings."
1,don't buy this product!!,"Used this heart rate watch on and off for about a month. Heart rate picking right but after a month the watch just reflected zero heart rate! I thought this was only a battery issue. After changing battery, still no reading even though i was busting my ass off working out the insanity program! Unbelievable! For the price of $35 this is not worth buying to only use it for a month!"
3,Very Simple and Easy To Use,"This is my second heart-rate-monitor system. The first one was the POLAR F5 watch & chest strap. That one had a few more features than this model but the strap battery lasted only 3 months. I bought this particular model specifically because the battery on the chest strap is replaceable.The watch was an easy set-up but I soon realized there was no ""calories burned"" feature on this watch. I just assumed this would have it. To say the least...this watch & strap system is VERY BASIC. You've got your time of day/date/heart rate monitor/alarm/stopwatch. The mode display is a no-frills display.If this watch had a calories burned counter I'd give it the extra star. I will update this review in a month after some use."
1,Doesn't Work,"I was lured in because of the cheap price. You get what you pay for.It's not worth the hassle and money to return it.Please don't respond to this review with the usual ""Did you set it up properly?"" or the ever popular ""The band needs moisture to make the contact work""It's not near any other electronics at all.This product is a disappointment.Oh wait... it's beeping. It does work!!!My heart rate is... oh... maybe I should see a doctor about that.32 seems low, do ya think?"
3,Cheap but ?,"It was cheap, $30.10 including shipping, but it may not be as accurate as the more expensive ones. My heartrate will jump 10 bpm either way while doing nothing differently on my treadmill. This occurs every few minutes or so. I've learned to just take an average."
4,Great for Guys,"I'm 5' 4"", fit-looking, have a 36C bra size and average/medium bone structure. I couldn't find a single way to ensure accurate representation of my apical HR, no matter how tight the strap and where it was placed. Worked perfect on both my husband and teenage son, they have 2 different builds but neither are rail thin. Manufacturers need to address this, the only specialty item I saw was a HR bra."
2,Erratic Or Non-performance After 6 Months,"I bought this HRM based on a review in Consumer Reports. Initially, the monitor performed as advertised; however, after less than 6 months the monitor performs erratically when it functions at all. I've yet to try replacing the transmitter's battery to see if this will resolve the problem, but, regardless, I do not feel one should have to replace that battery after only 6 months of sporadic use. (I do not use it daily, only to occasionally make sure I am in my intended target zone) In the past, I have used a Polar HRM in the past which gave consistent, long term results. If replacing the battery resolves the problem, I will revise my rating for this product, but for now, I can only give it 2 stars."
4,Works very well,"I've had half a dozen different pulse monitors, and this one works better than any of the previous ones. The only problem I have with it is that if I put it too close the electronics on my treadmill, it refuses to work - seems to get interference from the treadmill. Accuracy is good. I haven't had it long enough to evaluate battery life, or durablity of the unit itself.After almost 2 years of use, I'm still very happy with the unit, but I must say that it eats batteries, and without warning just becomes erratic, and intermittent when it wants a new battery. I find myself replacing the battery in the transmitting unit about every 4 months, and I only use it for 2 hours a week, so that's less than 40 hours of use per battery. The receiver batteries last about twice that long (8 months), and the receiver is on all the time."
1,Lug on case breaks,"I bought one of these in May 2008. Technically the unit works fine. However, not long after I purchased it, one of the lugs on the case, where the strap pin fits into the case, broke. I returned it at my expense under warranty, I forget whether there was a handling charge, and it was replaced by Omron. However, the whole process was time consuming. Now a lug on the replacement unit has broken, and I am not going to bother with the replacement procedure,even if it is still under warranty. The cases are obviously defective. I have used numerous HRM's over the years, and this is the first time I have had this problem."
4,Can't beat it for the price,"At first, I thought I had made a mistake by purchasing this unit as opposed to the Timex heart rate monitor that's advertised here at Amazon. The problem was that I was initially getting mixed results with the heart rate reading when going for a bike ride. What I discovered was that if you use a little bit of Aloe Vera Gel on the transmitter 'contact points', it will instantly solve the problem. Other than this initial issue, it has been a great training tool and I highly recommend it for any one requiring a basic heart rate monitor."
2,Picture and Accuracy are deceptive,"The picture shows the watch and another item....that other item needs to be strapped to your rib cage which is uncomfortable to wear. I would be able to go through the discomfort, but the product was not reliable either. As a consumer, I would like to know the accuracy. If it says my heart is beating 50 beats a minute, as an engineer, I know that it may not be the case. I want to know the range that my heart may ACTUALLY be beating at."
1,Dissapointed,This product comprising the Omron Heart Rate Monitor only monitors from a transmitter strapped to ones chest. This is not what had been hoped for as a gift to my husband who has had similar priced watches that monitor from the watch itself and /or from a transmitter for about $50 AUS.Regrettably the advertising of this product is not clear or explicit enough and is another product which will not be used by my family.The labelling or advertising of this product must be amended to specify that the watch itself is not a monitor but merely a receiver watch with normal watch functions.
1,don't waist your money,It dose not tell you how much calories you are burning. I will return it tommorow not worth the money.
2,not good,"So I started training for the ING marathon, its 25 miles and well I'm a big guy, so I'm taking it slow and steady to win the race. No but seriously, with my previously small athletic and medical background, I am following coaches' schedule and training. With all that said, I will be purchasing many items from amazon and for my fellow prime addicts I will be leaving reviews on the products.way to many reasons why this is bad, really probably the worst item i bought in my journey, stay away"
3,No Calories Burned,"I returned this right away after realizing that it doesn't have a ""calories burned"" feature. That's the main thing I wanted and thought it was a standard feature."
2,Chest band a non-starter,"I don't know how this works because when I found that I would need to wear a chest band during exercise to make it work, I returned it. It isn't evident in the advert for this (or any other) heart-rate monitor. I guess I'll have to trust my sense of pain...."
1,Pulse rate monitor,"The monitor appeared to be without power when received. A call to Omron yielded the information that it was an obsolete model, but it sounded as if the battery had failed because it had been in inventory too long. However, they advised, to replace the battery would require taking it to a jeweler because it was a water resistant model. If this were not done the warranty would be invalidated. Amazon then replaced the original monitor, but the replacement also had no power. A refund from Amazon was requested and received and an unpleasant process finished - but still without a monitor."
2,The alarm/sound went bad after 30 days.,"The sound/alarm went back after 31 days - just 1 day after the return date.Nice quality control by the company! Can't be more precise, right?Bad quality. I am disappointed."
1,Doesn't work,"I bought this recently and it doesn't work. I tried getting the straps wet, i took it out side away from electronics and nothing seems to solve it. Customer service said replace the batteries. But I think it won't fix anything."
3,using Omron HR-100C Heart rate monitor,"This is a low end monitor, so don't expect too much. I had trouble even getting a pulse rate to show up, but after discussing via email with customer service (good time response, but not too helpful answers), I replaced the battery (my cost, they would not pay) and used an electrolyte gel on the sensors (that goopy, cold stuff they use in ultrasound tests), and it now works OK. Disclaimer-I have had open heart surgery and there are wires of some sort in there.) Still, the hr jumps around a bit and only sometimes settles down for a good consistant reading. If starting over, I would go with a higher level model in terms of quality (and I am sure, price.)"
1,COMPLETELY NON-FUNCTIONAL,"I've never had the need to leave a review on Amazon before, but I received this product and it was like having a random number generator... no accuracy, no consistency. VERY disappointed and I will be going to another brand."
1,Dead out of the Box!,Had to wait to get batteries for both the transmitter and the watch! Equipment comes with batteries. But they were batteries that were DEAD!!! 2 item with dead batteries in the equipment or packed in the box.
5,Accurate and Dependable,This is the second one of these I've ordered. I keep one at the office for when I run a local jogging track and another one stays at home with my exercise machines. I've found this watch to be very dependable and accurate. The value is hard to beat.
5,Inexpensive quality heart moniter,"This Omron heart moniter is so easy to use. The ProMaster treadmill I use at my work's gym picks up on the transmission so I don't even wear the watch. But when I have to use a treadmill without a heart moniter, the watch attaches to the handle bars nicely so I can stay within the cardiovasular range for my age and weight. It is a great value for the money and have promoted it to others."
4,Heart Rate Monitor review,I thought the product was good for the price you get it for. The strap that goes around the chest fits snug and comfortable. The only bad thing was it took a while getting used to the controls and settings. Overall it's a good product.
5,Great buy!,"We bought two of these heart rate monitors. The price was excellent; they are very, very easy to operate. One of the best purchases I've made online. Thank you. Art"
2,Did not works so good.,Some times it would work and some times it just did not work.I should have returned it. next time.
4,Basic HRM,"This is the most basic HRM. It shows HR, time, and a stopwatch. Nothing else. No problems here, just a good watch. This HRM comes with a bike handlebar attachement. So it would be good for those who want to attach it to a bike or treadmill."
2,Fragile,"This product falls well short of the quality that I expect from Omron. The first problem is questionable accuracy. It often gives me readings that I know are not correct. (One minute my heart rate may be 85 and five seconds later--without changing pace--it tells me that my HR is 140.) The other problem is the fragile nature of the case. I had used it no more than a dozen times and had not banged or bumped it significantly, yet the part of the case that holds the wristband pins broke on one side, rendering the unit useless. I cannot recommend this product. Spend a little more money and get a GOOD quality heart rate monitor."
3,Fair,Enclosed battery died relatively soon after purchase.Does not seem to be accurate at higher activity levels.
2,OMRON HR 100C,"The OMRON HR_100C does not work when I'm on the treadmill. I called OMRON customer service, thinking that I was doing something wrong with the monitor. I was told that it's interference from my treadmill. I'm disappointed with the monitor. Before I purchase the OMRON HR 100C , I read the reviews and I didn't read anything about interference problems until today when I was ready to write my review and notice that someone else had recently write an review referring to the interference.I will use it when I'm outside running as it's too late for me to return it."
3,Omron heart rate monitor,"A reasonably priced heart rate monitor. Chest transmitter is inconsistent in picking up the heart beat. Requires contact jelly or water. Suitable only for casual users. Not for serious or professional runners, marathoners or ironmen."
2,Poor Quality,"This is the second HeartRate monitor I've owned. My first was a Polar model, which I unfortunately lost during a move.I bought this Omron HR-100C model primarily due to its price, and also seeing that it was a best-seller on Amazon. Unfortunately I've found the quality lacking. Particularly when trying to switch between HeartRate and other modes, the watch will beep when the button is pressed, but won't always change modes. (It takes repeated presses of the button to change.) This is especially frustrating when you're riding and trying to fiddle with the fool thing.If all you need is a basic HR monitor, this will work. But if you also want to see the time, or use the stopwatch, I would look elsewhere."
3,"good, not great","After about 3 weeks of using the monitor during gym/treadmill workouts, it seems to perform up to the online description. It occassionally looses track of what it's doing and either underreports or wildly overreports. I suspect normal moving around breaks the sensors away from the body and produces the false reports. I am using electrode cream on the sensors, so it should be doing a little better than this. The sensing harness is comfortable and doesn't move around much. The display is clear and readable even in the so-so lighting of the fitness center."
1,inaccurate,"This product does not record my heart rate accurately, and it is uncomfortable. It displayed a heart rate 20 to 30 beats per min. less than what it actually was. Additionally, two of them cannot be used in the same room at the same time as they are the same frequency and get confused reading eachother's heart rates."
1,Worked Great....for about a month.,I was really happy with this heart rate monitor. I work out every single day except Saturdays. (The Sabbath) I purchased this based on reviews. And it worked great. And now.....after about a month. It don't work anymore. It keeps time. But the heart rate monitor stopped working. I tried replacing battery in the belt. Nothing. Too bad......I liked it. And now.....it's just a watch.
1,Doesn't work correctly!,"I was excited to get this heart rate monitor because it had such good ratings. I wanted to be able to make sure I was keeping my pulse in te right zone since I have a fast heart rate. Upon arrival, I set it up and tested it in my home and it seemed okay. Today, I took it to the gym for the first time and it would vary between not working at all and saying y heart rate was actually going down as I was working up a sweat! I followed the directions exactly and wet the contacts. And wwhile I was sweating copiously, it said my heart rate was 50. My resting heartrate is around 75 so this was impossible. Then it jump to about 80, go back down to 60, and then stop. Completely useless for me. Maybe it was defective, I don't know. No battery indicator light came on and since I only owned it for 2 days, I doubt that was the problem anyway. Ths is being returned."
4,Great product for price,"I purchased this heart rate monitor to kick up my cardio workouts. It works great - with just a few minor issues. the first is that it was advertised as a woman's monitor, but the strap is pretty large. I've got it adjusted to the smallest possible length, and still have to tuck it up under my workout tops. The other issue is with the warranty. To get the warranty, you need to fill in the serial number, which is supposed to be on the back. I have not found it yet and will need to call the company. Small stuff. Overall, a very good product."
5,Amazing product and amazing service,I love my Omron HR-100C Heart Rate. It works well and I was pleased with the priceas well as the quick delivery.
4,Excellent product for the price,"This is my first HR, at first I thought that the chest strap was gonna be a pain, thankfully I was wrong, the strap is quite comfortable and hardly noticeable, the watch is easy to use and it works very well unless someone is wearing another HR and you are very near it gets wrong data, but most of the times it works perfect. The package includes a very practical carrying case to protect your items. Excellent for beginners like me!"
5,Sweet deal,My husband bought me this for when I do aerobics. It has worked perfectly. It also has a beeper that lets you know if you heart rate goes too high or too low. Great product worth double the price.
1,Don't Waste Your Money,"I estimate I've used this HR monitor about 15 times, for about 30 minutes a session. The hard plastic chest piece is in three sections, so it will curve to fit your chest. Two of the sections broke apart this morning. There's no way to fix this.I have owned three heart rate monitors previously, and no chest strap units ever broke apart. I would say save your money, and buy a quality monitor instead of this one."
4,Omron HR 100 C Heart Monitor,"This works well, even on my gym's bikes and treadmills. It has a little trouble with my irregular heart beat, but is the best I have found."
2,Too big for smaller women,"This unisex watch is better suited for males than females. I have reasonably small wrists and the watch band was too long for me. Also the interface was bulky and too big for my wrist that it became uncomfortable to wear. Also the strap was too large as well. It took me to get it to its tightest setting to kind of fit me, but I'm sure if I had taken it running it would have fallen off.I'm sure if it would have fit, it would have been a great watch though."
4,Good monitor for good price,"Rather pleased with this product. Watch was much nicer quality/feel than I had expected. Works with the Polar treadmill monitors at the gym, too.I was wondering if it was worth the money to buy this because you can take your pulse with your own 2 fingers and your watch or the clock on the wall... after using it a couple months I would say that it is definitely worth it. The benefit is continuously working your heart/body at the level you want. It is not practical to keep your fingers on your neck or wrist the entire workout... with this, you don't need to do anything except watch the display change.I think that I get a much more effective workout by keeping my heart rate within the limits I want."
4,a good little find,"Good, basic little heart rate monitor. The numbers are in the range I was seeing on the tread mill's heart rate monitor so I assume it to be accurate. Worth the money just for the watch alone."
4,Make your workouts more effective,"Nice product. Works well whether I'm weight training or on the treadmill. The wireless nature of the device makes workouts easy with no connections needed, the chest sensor is not uncomfortable at all. I don't tend to wear the display on my wrist, but have it strapped to the treadmill itself, makes it easier to read and more handy."
4,Works good ... just not certain about it's accuracy,Easy to use and never loses its reading. But it does seem to register a little high. Was suspicious of high amounts on monitor after exercising and so checked it against resting heart rate. I counted 60 but the monitor read 69.
4,walker,I very much enjoy using this product. It keeps good track of my heart rate while I am walking on my treadmill. I did discover that if my skin dries then the monitor does not work but I fixed that by wetting my skin under the cheat strap instead of just the strap itself and had no further problems. The strap is comfortable to wear and I am looking forward to many days of exercise with it.
3,Somewhat Sattisfied,"I bought this item for my boyfriend predominantly based on the good reviews. He would have been happier had the battery not needed immediate replacement upon taking it out of the box. Other than it being shipped with a bad battery, he is satisfied with the product and capabilities as a unit."
1,Not worth the postage,I bought a second one because they are cheap. Now I have two that don't work. Worthless POS
2,You get what you pay for.,"It worked flawlessly the first few times, then could only pick up every second or third heartbeat- or was reading my number of footsteps perhaps. A consistent 70bpm reading is not helpful for trying to train, and offputting when it flatlines to 0 bpm in the middle of a run. I could buy some of that gel to smear on under the strap every time, but you shouldn't have to. Not sure if this is a feature of the (very nicely priced) monitor or of this type of product in general, but generally i've been underwhelmed and have stopped even trying to use it when training."
4,Great product,Thanks to the Omron heart rate monitor I can work out at my fat burning rate with accuracy. I don't have to guess or over exert myself.
4,Good for what it can do,I really enjoy this heart rate monitor. The only downfall is that it does not track calories or give you any kind of summary. If you are working out on a machine that has a wireless receiver then you can use the summary on that piece of equipment. Does what it says it will and for the price is pretty good.
1,dead battery,The monitor itself was great for about a week and then it froze up and the watch did nothing. I called Omron and they said that the battery was low and that it must have been on the shelf at Amazon for quite a while and so it got low because Omron put the battery in at the plant. So...I had to go to a jeweler (because it is sensitive and waterproof and they said not to trust a discount store clerk) and have a battery put in. I am disappointed that this is not covered by any warranty. I am disappointed in Amazon for sending out old equipment.
5,Very accurate,This product was very helpful for excercising. Keeping your heart rate at 80% of max gives you the most from your workout and the best way to burn fat. Using this item helps me stay in my target zone. Very affordable.
1,Doens't track the heart rate,"When I first put this on, it kept jumping numbers. And, not just a number here or there, but rather one second it told me my heart rate was 128, the next 72, and so on! And, I was sitting down while testing it. It kept doing that, and never settled on a viable range. I thought maybe I was doing something wrong so I brought it to my training session, my trainer looked at it and it did the same thing for her. It even kept giving heart rate figures up to 3 minutes after she took it off! She looked at me and without hesitation, told me to return it as soon as possible and get something that actually works. Don't bother with this, the money you ""save"" isn't worth it."
3,good watch bad strap,The watch is fine and gives the heart rate as it should. The big problem with this product is the flimsy strap you have to put around your chest. The previous one I bought only lasted a couple of weeks before breaking. I hope the second one lasts a bit longer.
1,Look for something better.,"Bought this in 2010. The transmitter fits well and is comfortable. The transmitter battery is easy to replace. The receiver, however, is a completely different matter. It is big, bulky, and when the battery dies, you need a jeweler to change it. Mine is in the trash as I write, and I'll be buying something else to replace it."
2,Stops showing heart rate after 15-20 minutes,I have had the transmitter for about a year now. Was using on and off. Recently I have started using more often. It shows the heart rate for about 15-20 minutes and then just displays 0. I adjusted the strap etc. but the value does not change. I don't think this is a batter problem as it works next day.
3,satisfactory heart monitor,It's just fine the way it is. I shopped carelessly and didn't realize there was no calorie counter feature on the unit.
1,doesn't work at the gym,there's an interference with gym equipment and it doesnt pick up a signal. I returned it.
5,Great value Works Great!,"After I ordered this monitor I read several reviews that painted a poor picture of this device. After receiving and setting up and using for an entire day I found no issues with the chest strap pickup. The manual instructs the user to wet the pickup area with water or a conductive gel. My wife uses a tens unit and some gel came with it so I applied a very small amount onto the pickup areas of the sensor. It worked perfectly from the very start. I have had it on for over six hours without a single loss of signal. I am recovering from some heart issues so working up a sweat was not an option for me at this point. So for those of you having issues with the sensor, pick up some electrode gel, You will find it works without water or persperation."
2,All over the place,This device would not properly quantify my heart rate. It went all over the place and i tried it numerous times. Even wet my chest before i applied it. Oh and the batteries were completely dead on arrival! I will give it up for the quality though it is a sturdy accessory and looks sharp. Hopefully i just had a malfunctioning unit.
5,Awesome,"I got this for my husband for Christmas not knowing if he'd like it or not, but he loves it and it has really inspired him to keep running."
4,My treadmill reads this strap,"I recently got a used Star Trac treadmill at an auction. I was bummed when I got it home and discovered that the heart rate monitor display did not work when I held the hand grip sensors. I own one of these Omron heart rate monitors, so I figured I would just wear it while I did my treadmill. I was suprised to see the heart rate display on the console of the treadmill when I put on the strap. It was wirelessly reading the strap! So,,that is cool,,,I dont have to look at the watch, I can see it on the console. A pleasant surprise. The Omron seems to work good, and is accurate most of the time. I can feel it when it is on, but isn't too uncomfortable and stays in place well. Overall, I am pleased with it."
3,"ok, but...","The product works fine, but the first time I used it, the raised crystal on the watch got scratched, directly blocking the time viewing area. Also the numbers (time, heart rate, etc) are of a font that is not particularly easy to read. Other than that, the product is good for the price."
4,Battery change is complicated.,"This is a two piece package. You get a chest strap that is read by any standard monitor. This means that any of those treadmills, bikes, and ellipticals in your gym that have a Polar system will read it.The other part is the watch/monitor. That worked pretty well until the battery died. I tried to replace it myself, and it has not worked since. I recommend you take it to one of those mall kiosks to have the battery changed.I feel like the chest strap was the more useful part anyways, and I use it every time I go to the gym."
1,Kinda Junky...,"I used this once. When I went to use this again two days later, it didn't work. I am a fat woman running, at it was registering either no heart rate, or a rate of something like 60. I tried all of the troubleshooting steps in the istructions, it didn't work. So, there went that idea."
4,Thumbs Up,"This is my first heart rate monitor so I don't have a lot to compare it to! I bought it for the low price. I LOVE it! It's made my workouts far more effective. The only thing that I don't like about it is that the monitor must stay moist once it's made contact with your body or it loses its signal. Once you break a sweat that's no problem, but warming up, it loses its signal here and there. I'd highly recommend this monitor still!"
4,Omron HR-100C Heart Rate Monitor purchased at Amazon,"Having recently joined a cardio rehab group, following a heart attack,I had a need to purchase a heart rate monitor, for use at the rehab gym as well asat the sport club where I also work out.The nurse at the hospital rehab group gave me a copy of a recent Consumers Reportwhich showed this product as a recommended good buy.I immediately went to Amazon, where I found the product at an attractive price, with free, (and fast) delivery.The monitor is working very satisfactorily."
3,"It gets the job done, but...","Note to potential buyers: I have no problem using this monitor. It's easy to set up, and I like the option of clipping it onto my bike instead of having to wear it on my wrist during a workout. However, this monitor only tells you your heart rate, and whether you are above or below your target heart rate (as long as you program that information in). The monitor doesn't tell you anything about how many calories you've burned, or how long you spent in each heart rate zone. So if you're just looking for a way to measure your heart rate, then this is for you. If you're looking for something more specific and that gives you more information, keep shopping."
1,I Give Up On This,"I am returning my third and last Omron Heart Rate monitor. The first one worked fine for the first 2 days I used it for my workout, then it would not register unless I tapped on the receiver on my chest, usually a very hard tap. It would then start to work and then stop. Not very reliable and it was adding about 30 minutes to my workout screwing around with it. I returned it with no problem after they shipped me a replacement(That's one of the reasons why I love Amazon). The second one lasted 1 day, same problem. I thought I'd go for 3 and....guess what? Same problem after one day. I give up on this one and I'll try another brand."
1,Heart rate monitor,The product simply did not work. The watch part worked but the heart rate monitor did. I called the factory and they advised that even though the product was new that I should replace the battery. I did that and it still did not work. The factory said that I could not return it to them and Amazon's policy is that it can't returned unless the box is unopened. Long story short I just through out some money.Omron HR-100C Heart Rate Monitor
2,Craps out after 6 months,"This monitor is great when it works. I bought mine 6 months ago, and now it has ceased working. I replaced the battery, and still nothing. I would complain to Omron, but because it was so cheap, it hardly seems worth it. Especially if the next one fails as well. Also, the chest strap is too big for me (I wear a size 8 in US women's clothing, 32 in bra size). Even if I wear it as tight as it goes, it slips around. I should have looked at smaller models, so that's entirely my fault. The short lifespan of the device is most definitely not my fault however."
2,ONLY DOES THE BASICS - NOTHING MUCH ELSE,"I've just purchased the HRM. Very basic model. Yes it will display your heart rate, but I cant get it to show both my heart rate and the stopwatch on the same screen. It will give you feedback while you are working out, but not any usefull information after (i.e. what your average rate was during the session, your maximum, how long you were in your target zone). I should have done more research really, and it was pretty cheap for a chest strap model, but it will just be a backup unit if my ""real"" one (which does all that listed above) dies."
2,Great when it works,"I was excited to find a HR Monitor with a strap at such a reasonable price, I didn't want just a watch that you had to put a finger on the sensor, I wanted more real time information. I wish I would have spent a little more for more consistency. It worked great for the first few weeks, but now if seems like it's barely working, I can be in the middle of a workout, huffing & puffing away and the watch shows a '0' for my HR, or if not a really low number. You are also supposed to be able to use it without wearing the watch (but keeping it within a certain radius of you - pretty much as soon as I take the watch off, the HR starts to drop."
2,Inconsistent readings leaks and does not work in water (swimming) as stated,I figured I would give it a shot considering there were more positive than negative reviews. Readings appear to be inconsistent. It Does not give any reading while swimming which I really wanted it to do. Now it is leaking and I have to send it back. Spend a bit more money and get something reliable.
2,"I really wanted to like this heart rate monitor, *but*...","the heart rate readings were erratic and inconsistent. Also, the alarm letting you know when you are outside of your heart rate training zone is barely audible.The controls are nice, and the transmitter and receiver are very comfortable to wear.Unfortunately, the cons outweigh the pros. It's going back to Amazon.com."
2,Difficult to operate/understand device.,"I was unable to get this device to function to the point I could monitor my heart rate. The good news is, they took it back without discussion."
2,Might work not sure,"I ordered this monitor based on the reviews that I read. So far I've not had success in getting the unit to work. It could be the user, I'm not sure. I'm planning to give it one more try before returning it."
3,I'm old,"I bought this for myself and I'm getting really frustrated with the fact that I can't buy any gadget today that does ONLY what I bought it for. I don't need it to tell time, warn me when my rate is too high or too low, act as a stopwatch or make me breakfast. If I'm going to use an exercise machine that will give me my heart rate just by using the strap, it's fine. But if I need to read the rate from the watch, it takes forever to get it into that mode. I'm sure it's because I'm pathetic with technology, but doesn't anybody out there make products for us old fogeys?"
2,Watch Stopped Operating in One Week; Warranty Service Issue,"Worked great for a week, then watch display froze. The chest strap works fine and is compatible with the machines at our local YMCA. If that weren't the case, then I'd rate this product one star. If the watch continued operating, I'd rate this product five stars.Update Dec 10, 2009In accordance with the instructions in the HR-100C manual, I returned the unit to Omron for warranty service. The unit was returned by the USPS with an ""Unable to Forward -- Return to Sender"" notice. I sent a message to Omron asking for help. I'll update with their response.Update May 9 2010Omron changed their warranty service location which accounts for the RTS notice. They repaired the unit and also defrayed the shipping cost in both directions. I have no issue with the Omron warranty repair process (other than the incorrect address)."
3,Hard to use....I gave up.,"I guess I don't have the patience required to use this kind of product. You need to attach the belt to your chest, get it positioned just so, and then hope you can get a reading. I tried to use it 3 times, and had to give up as it is way too much hassle. I wish it could get the readings directly from your wrist."
2,Omron HR- 100C Heart Rate Monitor,"Even for this price, it is a CRAPPY heart rate monitor. I bought this to use during running workouts in a specific heart rate zone. I set up my heart rate zone, and the alarm (which is a beep) goes off when you're out of your zone is very slow (about every 2 seconds). The same exact beep goes off when i'm above my heart rate or below my heart rate. So while working out, this is pointless if you're trying to stay in a specific zone (ex. 140 beats per minute and 155 beats per minute). Also, another problem...you can't view the stopwatch and your heart rate at the same time, have to choose either or. Just my input, disappointed that I bought this even though it was cheap."
1,just threw it away,"Worked great when not moving - heart rate ranged from 54 to 267 while exercising. Tried it 3 different times and gave up, wish I had saved the packaging to return it."
1,What's up with this? OMRON HR-100C,"I have had the omron HR100C for about five months. It has been reliable, as far as I can tell. It agrees well with my elyptical machine pulse counter. Today, it started to read about one half my pulse rate. There was no warning, no battery signal, which is a feature with this unit. I am curious if it needs a battery, again, no indication of that. Do the 'conductive pads' need cleaning? This is the first sign of failure for the device. It is troubling, this sort of failure, in that it might encourage someone to over-exert themself, to make up for the 'low' indication of the device. This is rather shocking. It is lucky I had the elyptical machine-generated pulse rate at twice the rate, obviously a failure of the Omron device, to gauge my work out. Heaven knows what might have happened otherwise.Omron HR-100C Heart Rate MonitorIs this a common problem? There was no indication of low battery, yet a dangerously low HR indication... exactly one half my HR!!!"
2,Chest strap was too big,I like the watch but the chest strap is too big for me. This is definitely a heart rate monitor that is better suited to men.
1,This never worked for me !,"Tried it on Day One. It did not work. Changed the batteries as per instructions in the manual, but of no use. Returned to store as its waste of money !"
5,Omron Heart Monitor works great,"I ordered the heart monitor to keep pace with my newpower workout. It works great. Don't try to forgo themanual: you've gotta know what buttons to push!Easy to operate once you've read the short manual.With a push of the button I can see my current pulse rateand know immediately whether I need to adjust my workout.Its a watch, stopwatch, and heart monitor."
2,Only does the bare minimum,"It's just fine for measuring heart rate, but that's ALL it does. It doesn't tell you how many calories you've burned, how long you've worked out, your min / max / avg heart rate for a session was or anything of the sort. If all you want to do is just know your heart rate at a given moment in time, I guess this is fine. If you actually are using the heart rate monitor to help measure and track your work outs, I suggest you get the Timex Personal Trainer HRM instead. For around $10 more, you can actually get a summary of your workout and how many calories you've burned, rather than just what your heart rate is this second."
2,Scratch prone,"The heart rate monitor works as advertised and can pair with treadmills to show heart rate. Sometimes, even without other running besides you, the reading vary wildly despite the chest strap is put on properly.The watch surface is very scratch-prone. After the battery is dead, try to replace the battery on the watch made it completely dead. All LED bar lights up and stay there. Very disappointed in the product."
4,Great for basic needs,"I purchased this monitor last year while training for a series of races and so far it has done everything that I've needed it to do. It's simple, straight forward and will meet the needs of most people who are your basic weekend warrior. I almost didn't purchase it because of some reviewers who said they had issues with interference, unreliable readings and poor contact from the chest strap, but I haven't experienced any of those problems in almost a year of use. A great product for someone who's just beginning to workout or who doesn't need anything too fancy to monitor their heart rate."
4,Omron Heart Rate Monitor,"The unit works just fine.But silly me, when I read that it had a high/low alarm I thought the alarm was audible. Nope, a little heart flashes on the watch which is nice if you can keep looking at the watch.Omron didn't lie, but I think 'indicator' would have been a better description."
1,Don't Waste Your Time,I bought this watch as a replacement for one being repaired it (different brand) didn't last a month. The screen froze up at 12:55 and could not change mode. It was a waste of time.
5,great product,"I've never had a heart rate monitor before so I can't compare it to other brands, but this one is great. It's easy to use and seems quite accruate. My husband and I each got one as we are both involved in a daily exercise program, this monitor has been invaluable in helping us stay in the zone we are to be exercising in."
2,Heart Rate Monitor - well sometimes,"This heart rate monitor works well...at times. A lot of times is goes offline or can't find my heart rate. When's its working, its great. So far, no other issues. I think you are getting what you pay for - a cheaper heart rate monitor that functions that way.I utilize this at the gym daily. Once I get a strong sweat going, it tends to be working."
4,Good product for the price,pretty good HR monitor. would be nice if it had an average and also a max HR but can't complain
1,this product is terrible,"When I first ordered this product it did not work at all. The screen was completely blank. I sent for a new one, which appeared to work initially. However after I started exercising with it I realized that it was indicating my heart rate was extremely high. During one run it said my heart rate was over 200. Since I am still alive, clearly the monitor was not functioning properly."
4,Nice Product,"Nice and reliable product. It comes packaged with a set of nice extras, like a practical carring case, mounting kit for the cardio machines, etc. I also found the nice surprise that the monitor uses the same frecuency that the cardio machines at my gym, thus I can see my heart rate in the machine display without the need to use or even carry the wrist display. One thing I would like to see added is a way to store and download my exercise sessions."
2,Omron HR-100C Heart Rate Monitor,Doesn't work for me. It isn't an easy product to understand. I don't get much out of the instructions. The heart rate part won't start up for me.
3,Not what I needed,"I tried a heart rate monitor 10-12 years ago. It was one of the first generations. The problem I had was that the treadmill I was on made so much electrical noise, It would only give me a reading when I was 3-4 feet from the treadmill. Not much use. I thought that newer technology would be better, so I gave it another try with the OMRON HR-100C. Apparently not. New heartrate monitor, different treadmill, same problem. When standing or walking, it reads fine. Once on the treadmill, very sporatic. If it reads, it is all over the place, 50, 150, 90..., but usually nothing. Once I get off the treadmill, it starts reading fine."
3,It is good for price,"This heart monitor was a good price and it works just fine. It was fairly easy to program following the directions in the booklet that comes with it. What it doesn't do which I thought it would is notify you when you are over or under your personal range for where your heart rate zone should be: it doesn't! The band is also not small enough for me and it did not come with a smaller band so it slips down while I am working out. My chest is about 34"" so if you are bigger than that it should be fine. Ultimately it works and if you are ok with constantly looking at your watch while working out to know if you are in the zone then it will be good for you."
5,Handy Item,"This heart rate monitor works great. I can exercise anywhere now and know I am going at a rate that will benefit my overall health. No more staying on one machine at the gym. I can move around and change exercises as frequently as desired, hopefully preventing repetititve injuries. This is much better for my joints. I like it very much!"
1,Cheap but not worth it.,"I purchased this on December 30, 2010 from Amazon and bought it strictly on price. I realized the old adage ""you get what you pay for"" might be in play here, but figured the unit would last at least a year. It did; almost. On Dec 27, 2011, I strapped it on and one of the transmitter straps came off rendering it useless (similar to another responder). I couldn't contact Omron Healthcare until after the new year and they gave me an RMA. I sent it to them and they returned it(not fixed) saying it was out of warranty. The one star is not so much for the unit, but for their service department. If you're going to give a one year warranty, honor it even if it's a few days before or after the purchase date. Jerks."
2,Good while it lasted..,"It worked pretty good when i got it, but after 3 months starting to give me very erratic readings and then go back to normal, after the 5th month it started going haywire and the alarm starting going off at random times during the day, and finally it died around the 6-7 month.for the price i didn't expect much, but it served its function as an introduction to hear rate monitors and learning experience."
3,Horrid,"This is my first review ever, but chose to make it due to the fact that I despised this piece of equipment.Having been a runner in high school, I had used heart rate monitors while in practice. We used to them for speed training. Going to college I quickly stopped running and got out of shape, and now want to remedy that. I bought this mostly to help increase my speed, by monitoring my heart rate I can find out how hard I am working, so that I do not work too little nor too much. Viewing the reviews I decided that this would be a good one for me to have.First, it is not nearly as accurate as others that I have tried. I wish it was.Second, the band is a pain to get on, and the cheap plastic broke after a few months. The band should be something not needing to be worried about, but in this case it wasn't.I am going to look for a new heart rate monitor, I sure hope that it will be better than this one."
4,Best buy out there,"The Omron is excellent. Easy to use. Easy to setup.I do wish it had 3-5 zones for training but it is exactly as they describe it. Most of my fitness clubs equipment picks up the HRM right away so for the price, it is well worth it for the more novice work out people, like me. I doubt I will ever need more features from an HRM so the Omron will hopefully stick around for years.So far so good."
4,Good Choice,"It is a very good option if you are a beginner and you want this watch for basic purposes.For the price, it's definitely worth it. The only thing that I will add to its features is the option of keeping record of your past tracks and paces, to monitor your progress."
3,Too Big for Women,I bought this and had to return it because the strap was too big and would fall down off my chest. It was at the smallest setting on the strap. Too bad.
5,It helped me find my zone,"I really don't know how to exercise. But I am getting up there in age enough I didn't want to over do it. After talking with my doctor at the last visit he advised me on the heart rate I should shoot for. This device helped me target my heart rate as I walk or jog. Overall it works very well. I haven't had any issues with it. It straps around your chest which works OK for me because my stomach sticks out enough to help keep it up. I'm not sure how it works on a skinny person. I guess they could just tighten it up a litte more. Anyway I really like it, works as advertised."
2,not as good as timex,"Battery in chest strap lasted 1 month.My biggest disappointment is the lack of memory response. My Timex (same price) gives a memory readout of total time, average heart rate, and highest heart rate in a display read out at the end or the workout. The timex also has a larger display for the heart rate.The Omron hr 100c beeps when you are outside a predetermined heart rate range. But I do not need this, I want to know a summary of my workout, and be able to see the heart rate display durning my workout."
2,Almost Good Enough,"It just didn't provide a consistent enough reading. It gave me a general idea of what my heart rate was, but sometimes it would jump around and once it said that my HR was around 100 for a minute or two when I know it was more like 160-170. I was prepared for this to happen, since other reviewers noted this flaw, but it was worth a shot for the price. If you aren't particular about the reading consistency and just want something cheap, this might work for you. I found it to be somewhat frustrating."
3,"product OK, amazon qc is a problem","After reading many reviews of heart rate monitors, I selected the HR-100C as a gift for my uncle. However, I was totally embarrassed because the monitor arrived with dead batteries in it. My uncle called Omron and was told he needed to take it to a watch shop to have the battery replaced. So, if you think you're getting a good deal on a quality product, you may want to reconsider. They capitalize on the hassle of doing a return.Omron HR-100C Heart Rate Monitor"
4,Omron HR-100C Heart Rate Monitor,"This is a cool gadget. I work out almost everyday, and it is really nice to know my heart rate to determine the intensity of my exercise. The wrist watch portion has a lot of utility. It's comfortable and easy to read. The instructions are easy to understand. The adjustable strap that holds the ""sender"" on the chest secures it enough to wistand a lot of vigarous motion. Only draw back is that the adjustment buckle can get a little sore after about eight hours!"
3,Just the facts.,"This model is very basic works, but loses the heart rate signal at arms length. This is my first monitor so I didn't expect much for $30.00. If your looking for bells and whistles this ain't it."
2,Problems Getting HR,"I bought this HRM and the first day I had problems. It seem to work fine as long as I didn't exercise. I do most of my exercise running on a treadmill, so I though it was just some kind of interference from the TM. But even when I kept the watch away from the TM displays I either got no readings or very inconsistent readings.Amazon was great about returning it and I bought the Schwinn Elite. It seems to have some TM update interference too, but seems to read accurately when I let go of the hold bars and bring the watch closer to the belt."
5,Omron heart rate monitor,"I like it. It has already alerted me to an unwise high heart rate, so I have modified my workouts accordingly. The wrist-band is unnecessarily heavy and stiff."
1,Simply doesn't work,"I'll make this quick. I tried all sorts of methods; this heart monitor simply doesn't work. For me, it registered every other heartbeat, and about 10% of the time (when my heart beat was under 80) it was accurate. I tried wetting the contacts a little, a lot, wearing the chest band as tightly as I could bear it. Still didn't work. What a terrible piece of equipment. Went out and bought a Polar FS7 instead, which works beautifully, reliably, accurately.Don't buy this one. Spend a little more and save yourself the aggravation."
2,"Great price, great features, doesn't work around electronics","This watch had all the features I was looking for and worked fine until I tried using it while on the treadmill. Like another reviewer mentioned, it is easily affected by gym equipment and couldn't get a heartrate then. I returned the item (Amazon was great) and got the Timex instead. More money, but it works fine."
4,"Works fine, but cheap material","I have had this heart rate monitor for nearly a year. I use it while biking, running and work outs. The tranmsmitter needs some getting used to. It almost feels like I am wearing a bra! It is a little uncomfortable and I can see that it often misses a heart beat when I am doing certain work outs. After wearing it about 20 times, both ends of the strap broke. I have the strap tied to the sensor now. Otherwise, it works fine."
2,Battery DOA,"Low rating due to the battery in wrist monitor being dead when I received it. Compounded by the not our problem response from Omron customer service.From Omron customer service:""The batteries are trial batteries and are only meant to last for about 6 months. The batteries are not covered under the warranty, therefore, we do not have them so send out."""
5,Exceeded my expectations,"If you exercise at a gym with Polar compatible equipment, this heart rate monitor is a steal. The chest strap works with the tread mills and eliptical trainers at my gym, so I don't even bother with the watch.I believe an HRM is a critical part of an exercise program where you are trying to achieve a goal, whether it be weight loss, endurance training or strength training. Staying within your target zones will help you get the most from your exercise. I alternate between strength training and weight loss every 3-6 months. Until I started using this HRM, I was training far too hard during my weight loss exercises. I adjusted my pace, and found I could exercise for much longer, and burn more calories. It seems pretty obvious, but I didn't know I was overtraining until I started using this HRM."
5,Perfect for what I use it for.,"I use this while swimming. When swimming the chest strap has to be tightened a little extra, but it works. I also use it for circuit training because first I use the eliptical, then the weight machines. I do not rest between machines to keep heart rate in the proper zone during the entire workout, perfect."
2,okay - not great,"It works, but seems to have a ""delayed reaction"" in that it takes several seconds for the monitor to reflect increases or decreases in heart rate.Also - - I failed to realize there is only a visual alarm (not a sound alarm) to indicate the heart rate is above the set limit."
4,works well so far with just water,"In seeing that others purchased this with the electrode gel, I ordered that, too. While I've only used the monitor twice so far, I have not needed to use anything other than water to establish the contact necessary. No, I don't sweat heavily. Maybe this is just because it's new, but I wish I had not ordered the gel to go with it.My only criticism so far is that it would be nice if it beeped when entering or exiting the target heart rate settings. Instead, you need to keep looking at the watch to see if you're in the right range or not.UPDATE: I've now owned this monitor for about 4 or 5 months and still do not need to use anything other than water to establish contact to get a reading."
1,doesn't work for running,"Very disappointed. I used it for indoor stationary bikes and it worked perfectly. However, for outdoor running, it is utterly useless. It gives a reading of 0 about 1/3 of the times; and then would go from 90 to 170 in two seconds, or go up and down in a range of 100 and 230 all the time. According to this reading, I guess I should be ushered into an emergency room right away...."
4,Does the Job,"If you're looking for an heart rate monitor to just ""do the job"" than this one is fine. By no means the top of the line, but you get what you pay for. Great for Running, Spinning, etc. Seems to be pretty accurate. Chest Strap can be a little annoying but it's essential for an accurate read."
4,Great Deal,I own an out patient therapy clinic and use these items on a daily basis. I have paid $150 and up for monitors in the past but this item worked the same as the more expensive ones. Easy to set up and use. I would recommend this item to anyone.
1,Do not buy Omron products,"I just purchased an Omron heart monitor HR 100C. It arrived, completely dead. I called Omron and they said too bad, ""we don't sell directly, so we are not responsible."" They also said, this is not advertised, that the battery in the watch is for trial purposes only!!! Then you have to take it to a jeweler to have the watch battery replaced or you'll void the warranty. OMRON DOES NOT STAND BEHIND THEIR PRODUCTS, THEY HIDE BEHIND THE FACT THAT OTHER RETAILERS SELL THEM. Do not buy from Omron if customer service matters to you at all."
4,As Good As It Gets So Far For The Film Version,"So far this is the only recording of the original motion picture soundtrack that sounds decent! I'd been looking for this for years and stumbled upon it almost by accident, since it doesn't show the stars of the movie on the cover. I know there's been a hassle with the Gershwin estate over the rights to both the movie score and the film, but now, many years later it's just gotten ridiculous!This is an import made in Germany that was either recorded directly from the film or from the original Columbia recording.....in any case it sounds good, but would sound much better if it was allowed to be remastered!If you loved the score from the film as I did, you'll love this too even though it's not a perfect recording from the film YET!"
4,Great game,This a very old game I've looking for for a while and I m glad Amazon had it. I m enjoying it!!
5,best car game,"I have to say that I am also dumbfounded by the negative reviews . EA is the king of car games . Really fantastic graphics and car physics and the game play is a perfect combo of arcade and simulation . The game play on f1 2001 is real cool too but I don't have a good enough system (yet) to enjoy that game . Check out pcgamer.com for a review . I just got my porsche unleashed to run on windows 2000 . I tried 3 things , I think the last one did it =>1. Erased gimme.dll .2. Set page size to 256-256 .3. Run the following from Start/Run : regsvr32 %systemroot%\apppatch\slayerui.dll . I believe this is supposed to trickthe app to think it's running on windows 98 ."
3,its ok,"i have this game i play in a little, if u really wanna play a game play kawasaki fantasy motocross thats a good game"
1,Do not buy,"Horrible. Just horrible. The graphics and bad and the game is not fun to play. Half the time the game does not even work. I suggest that you get any of the previous Need For Speed games, 1, 2, 3, or 4 but don't get Porsche Unleashed."
4,Nice Job!!!,"Great graphics and landscape. Challeging and fun gameplay. It would have been better with police and more features. Overall, great for fans of NFS, and pretty much all racing games."
3,"Long book, but rather dissapointing","I got this book yesterday, it was well written and everything, but I was dissapointed from thhe long seciton of pages used for the episode guide, but no behind the scenes or making of things like the past two Buffy watchers guides had, and they should have had more on the actor profiles."
1,its a real Dämmerung,"Very good musical performance, but I didn't like the singers. The scenes and costumes are quite upsetting my traditional taste."
4,Good book.,"Not much to say. I got this boo for a German Lit class, and I actually liked it. One of the few I did. It's worth a read for anyone who is interested in Germany, or just Historical Fiction."
5,Simply great,"I finally used these pans last night to bake a chocolate cake. But as I placed these 2 pans into my oven, I realized my oven wasn't big enough to let them sit side by side and I didn't have a second level in it. So after placing them in a funny angle just to make them fit, I told myself they are going to be so unevenly baked! But to my amazement, they didn't! They were probably the most evenly baked cakes that have ever come out of my oven! I am going to get them now in all shapes and sizes!"
4,GREAT NON STICK PAN!,I really enjoy the cake pan i like that it doesnt stick to the pan. The only negative thing about the pan that i didnt like was my cakes came out really big if you want a smaller round cake i suggest using a little battee in the pan.
5,Good solid pans,"These are good, solid, baking pans. They each weigh about 2-3 times what my flimsy old Wilton pans did. They also bake cake layers much more evenly. They layers are more of a true cylinder in shape as well. Other pans are more tapered so that they stack, but then the layers are not true cylinders. I highly recommend these pans to any baker!"
2,It sticks,"I like it for its heavy weight and professional look. But it does stick. The care instruction says not to use pan spray since it will discolor the pan and leave rubbery residues on the bakeware and eventually make it stick. Thus, even though my recipiet said ""spray it"", I didn't... and guess what.. my cake just didn't want to come out in one piece. However most of my cake recipiets say to use spray...then I stuck. so now I leave my beautiful cake pan in the cabinet and hope one day I will find a recipeit says something else."
5,I love this CD!,"This CD holds a lot of memories for me. My brother and I used to take a lot of road trips, and he would sing to every single song and pretend he was Hank. That was many years ago, but everytime I hear this CD, I have to smile. (My brother still wishes he was Hank!)"
4,Country boy can survive,"Listened to Cd over a dozen times. Hank Williams has a way with words. I ordered Vol.#2.Cd played great, case in ok shape."
5,DAMN GOOD MUSIC,"This CD may not be for everybody; yet, pretty damn close. Fell in love with an American Dream, then All My Rowdy Friends. Still enjoy getting drunk and getting loud(at 54), amazing how many people look down at their noses at rowdiness anymore. Being an outdoor person, Country Boy Can Survive hits home. With the status of life in America, one may want to take lessons from a Country Boy. All songs are worth listening to !! Being a heavy metal/classic rock bass player, I was shocked at how this CD grew on me. One of my favorites. Hell; I am even thinking about looking into a steel guitar. A neighbor of 19 who is into rap, fell in love with this CD as well. For those that truly enjoy great music, for those that enjoy the TRUTH, for those that like to get loud; this CD is a MUST !!"
1,Amazon bait and switch,This album is in the $5 mp3 music. When you order you find out it is $9.99. I can find no way to then stop or change a digital order.
3,Does not contains all best cuts from his titles albums,"It contains ""Hank, Why Do You Drink?"" and other notable hits, but does not contain some his best works. To a Hank Williams Jr. fan like my friend, it is unsatisfactory, but it will do."
2,I Heard Mama Say To Daddy,"How the son of a country star could claim to have hillbilly credibility is frankly beyond me, but there he is. For the most part, Hank sounds like just what he really is, a poseur whining about the trails of being a rich rock star. He does hit the mark on occasion as with `The American Dream' and `A Country Boy Can Survive' but mostly this is just fluff"
4,"Highly recommended, but use along with a therapist.","Helping Your Child Overcome Seperation Anxiety or Shcool Refusal is a sound, practical book for helping parents learn to help their children overcome seperation anxiety in many different forms and settings. I will enjoy implementing the techniques with my clients.I gave this book only four stars because while it is easy for a clinician to read and fill in the behavior modification and coping skill gaps they left out, it will not be so easy for many parents.Parents who have anxious children are advised to get this book, but share it with a trained clinician/therapist. It is helpful in that it gives you an idea of what your child's anxious situations and behaviors are, how you have been handling them as a parent (personality type) and what safety situations your children prefer. It will be easier to implement with a trained person who can give you even further techniques, feedback and moral support when you need it."
4,Help for understanding,I felt like this book helped me better understand the reasons behind the anxiety and some of the methods did bring some relief. However I think with younger children it's always a challenge to really cure serios anxiety.
3,too short!,"Very nice video, but much too short (<7 min) for the price of $10.49! Beautiful views of the lake and informative history. Should have been 1 hour and 7 minutes long!"
1,Waste of money,"I purchased the Sharper Image Microdermabrasion At Home System from Sharper Image online. I thought it would be an improvement upon the Neutrogena system I also own because it is rechargeable and has multiple attachments. When it arrived, several of the attachments were chipped, the electric white cord has a lovely brown stain on it and best of all, it doesn't work after charging it for 2 days. I'm taking it back to their store. The product is actually made by Homedics and marketed by Sharper Image for more money. If you want a Microdermabrasion system, try the Neutrogena one. I love it. My skin is younger and fresher looking from using it regularly."
1,Great Concept But....,"This is a great concept for a product but it is just poorly made. My first one wouldn't charge up after two days of sitting on the charger. So I took it back to Sharper Image. My second one mostly worked (aside from the suction tools) for several months before it stopped holding a charge. I can say that my skin look fantastic whenever I could use this unit. If you are going to get this product buy the replacement plan, you will need it!"
5,Sharper Image Microdermabrasion Review,This product has changed my life and I love everything about it. First off the rechargeable craddle is a wonderful feature eliminating the need for battery replacement and it's always ready to go. Second there is no automatic timer that shuts off after a time limit. You have complete control and can enjoy your facial for a few minutes or LONGER. My skin looks and feels fresher and rejuvenated. I've even used it during my commute into work!
1,don't waste your money on this,"I purchased this and only used it a few times. Now the darn thing won't run. Don't waste your hard-earned money on this product. When it was working, it was OK but now I feel like this was a total waste of my money and I would not recommend this to anyone."
3,It works,"The iPhone gives you what you pay for... there are so many Skype phones that are in the $75 - $125 range, but this is a reasonable alternative. If you're okay with being tethered to your computer and will accept cellphone-level quality, this is a good product for the price."
2,Possible burned copy,"I believe that this DVD was a burned copy of the original. The quality of the picture was below expectancy and the box art was visually flawed with incorrect distributor nameing. My husband personally had his hand in the making of this documentary along with the distribution, and he was completely unsatisfied when he was given this copy as a gift."
3,"A Day In The Life: A Lot Happens, But What Does It All Really Mean?","2002's ""Mango Yellow"" represents one day in the lives of a diverse group of interconnected characters. It's fair to say that no one is particularly likable, and that might limit your emotional connection to the movie--but the actors are good and the various plot threads are well integrated. At the end of the day, there isn't a big message of import. The film is content to just showcase one day much like any other. There is drama, comedy, death, adultery, seduction, and a alluring wildness to the proceedings. The film kept me fitfully entertained even if it doesn't amount to a whole lot. Ultimately, though, that's kind of the point. KGHarris, 8/11."
1,"Secrets of Middle-Earth - Inside Tolkien's ""The Lord of the Rings"" (all 4 dvd's)","its not a movie it,s just a bunch of talking about the movie with still pictures. Not worth 10 cents."
2,superficial,"I'd been hoping for at least a somewhat intelligent discussion of Tolkien and his works. However, this documentary is fairly superficial. . It doesn't go into the story in any depth, and even gets some of the basic plot points wrong. Much of the background is stuff that any Tolkien fan would know (how many times have you heard Tolkien's story about grading papers and writing ""Hobbit"" on the page?). The artwork is mostly that done by the Hildebrants, which is good but more of a kid-lit style (which even they admit). Still, the documentary does get an extra star for containing some really unique footage of Tolkien reading passages from LOTR and even some Elvish. For this alone it might be worth watching, if not buying, the documentary."
5,Oma: The Faithful Daughter,"In Oma:The Faithful Daughter, Dr. Ogo Okoye-Johnson successfully addresses the timeless theme of a good heart and good works triumphing over the evils and misfortunes of life while captivating the reader with the sights and sounds that are an African village.Oma, the heroine, in spite of experiencing and adapting to the loss of wealth, social position, and a father's affection is able to summon the strength to meet and overcome the circumstances created by a life-threatening snake bite to her mother while capturing the heart of a prince.Although written and beautifully illustrated (by Dr. Okoye-Johnson's husband, Desing) to inspire the imagination and attention of children, Oma: The Faithful Daughter serves as a testament to the indomitable human spirit for all age groups."
5,Oma The Faithful Daughter,"I read this book to my children and they were enthralled by the story. My daughter's comment was Mom, Oma's story sounds just like Cinderella's story. My six year old now picks it up and reads it to her younger siblings. This book's colorful illustration would appeal to children of all ages and the message comes through loud and clear.Little ones will savor the story and follow Oma's journey to the happy ending. An intriguing book that every home should have.!Oge Onyekaba, Esq."
4,Images Of A Harlem Gone By,"I'm not from Harlem but it makes me no less sympathetic to the gentrification of the place that birthed the ""Black Renaissance"". This book has a very nice foreward that will capture in words what the artist is trying to say in her photographs.I have made a few visits to Harlem and saw some of what Ms. Attie portrayed in her photographs - national chain stores like Old Navy and H&M;, cops harassing street vendors just trying to make it, and the worst of all, a large majority of the older stores that have been in the community for decades boarded up. It's very sad. I just wish there would have been more photographs, I didn't want it to end. I also noticed that on or near page 65 is a portrait of 3 children, one little girl has on a pink shirt. This portrait was also used on the cover of the book, ""American dream : three women, ten kids, and a nation's drive to end welfare"" by Jason DeParle. Just thought I'd point that out. Good job Ms. Attie!!"
4,Good movie but...,"This is a second purchase of this item. The first was returned because the package was crushed when I got it. This package, while not totally crushed, was still damaged when it was received. I think the packaging of the 2 videos needs to be redesigned. Although both videos are fine, the case is broken and I fear will eventually damage one or both of the discs. I did not return the 2nd package because I was under time constraints to show the video to my students. Great movies. Bad packaging."
4,A lot better than Vol. 1,"After the disappointing Volume 1, this was a much better story. It introduces an extremely interesting Jedi named Master Fay, who is much too short lived. I know that tons of tons of Jedi die in the clone war, but it doesn't make it any easier when it does happen. I'm much more a fan of the prequels because of the Jedi and the abundance of them. Luke Skywalker is so weak whines even more than Anakin and is never really a real Jedi. Even though I was born in the mid 70's, the classic era isn't as interesting and the victories seem so far fetched, just like all the death of the Jedi seem in the Clone Wars. Anyway, both Asajj Ventress and Durge are present in this book for fans of those two characters."
1,worst cup of expresso I ever had,"I tried making expresso in this maker at least five times and every time the expresso came out bitter and undrinkable. At first I thought it was the expresso so I got a kind I knew was not bitter, but it still was terrible."
1,Do Not Buy This Item,"I don't what they were thinking when they said ""2 cups."" I have a number of stovetop espresso pots. This makes only a single shot. I thought it would make two shots. Also, the metal of the handle is exposed on two sides so cannot be picked up with a bare hand, but it is too small to pick up while using a potholder."
1,No proof this tribe exists,"If you surf the internet, there is no other mention of this tribe, except what is taught by her and her sister."
1,Ain't no QueerO Apaches...,Another new age scam artist. Why does amazon.com alllowsuch trangressions against the real natives of this land??
1,Crackpot,There is no such tribe as the Quero Apache. This lady is just another crackpot playing Indian.
4,Nice looking sturdy wood.,"I received the phone table today which was pretty fast delivery. I have not assembled it as of yet, but the first thing I noticed upon unpacking the parts was huge scrapes right in the from table side areas and all around the side of table top. I am not sure how to fix that, maybe a yellow marker?? Otherwise, it looks like a pretty sturdy table."
2,"Fair, cuts out low noise, adds a high hiss","I got a pair of these in a bundle. I tried them standing next to a machine like a low level noise (like an A/C or dehumidifier). It noticibly cut out about 70% of the machine noise. It had the same effect when used next to my PC which has several fans.Unfortunately, it also added a high-level snowy hiss. Although this hiss is not loud, it is noticeable and negates much of the value of using them.Also, as noted by several people, they are not particularly comfortable. Plus, when the cheap plastic frames moves across your head or bumps into the chair behind your head, these noise are transmitted through the hollow plastic.These are my only esperience with noise-cancelling heafphones, so I can't really contrast them with anything else. I probably wouldn't pay $50 for them, though.I did try them with a new battery and both with and without a music source attached."
1,Aiwa Noise-Canceling,"Save your hard earned $$$It's simple ""it doesn't work"" the best ones I've tried on were the Boss, but they're very expensive. So I'm still waitting on the price to come down."
3,"Good noise canceling, but POOR ERGONOMIC DESIGN.","DONT BUY IT!! The noise canceling is fine, but no matter how you adjust it, it gives you a headache only in a few minutes of wearing. It wont be good for traveling use!!! Then when else can you use it?"
4,Good for some purposes,"I've been using these headphones for a while and have been very pleased so far. First the battery life is outstanding. I used the headphones for over a year before the batteries ran out. Others have complained about the fit but I guess I'm lucky in that they don't bother me. There is some hiss when you turn them on and I wouldn't recommend them for quiet listening. In airplanes and on the subway however I have found the headphones to work very well in cancelling noise and the hiss is really not a factor. Sometimes high pitched noise like voices or loud headphones feel like they are amplified. Overall, for subway/bus/plane listening these are a good deal and I recommend them."
1,Good deal for people who like high frequency noise,"Ok,I bought these two or three months ago after a colleague told me that noise-cancelling headphones are very nice when you are on the plane for hours and hours. He spend $299 for his. When this set was on sale for $15 I asked myself what can go wrong - especially when brand Aiwa is behind this.Here are the reason why I don't like this set:- very, very annoying ""high hiss"" (see others people's reviews)- beside this extra noise I actually noticed only a little reduction of external noise; I tried it on the plane from California to Germany for I would say 2 min (couldn't stand the high hiss for longer), and also in an office with a desktop computer on; I'm not sure if external noise is really reduced or ears now focus on high frequency noise.- it is not very comfortable due to plastic top- with ""high hiss"" off, sound quality is like typical $5 headphonesHope this helps."
2,It is really aweful. Noise reduction works like Noise Production,"When I bought these headphones, I went through these reviews and figured it may not be as bad as some these guys are saying. Some guys were praising this so much that, I overlooked all the bad reviews and bought it anyway. Now, when I put some battries for using the noise-reduction feature, I get some new noise. This Hissing is unbearable, even while some music is playing. I would suggest you to buy these only if you are not gonna use the noise reduction feature."
4,Great Price good product for air travel,"When I first received my head phones I though they were ok at best, the sound quality was decent but the head strap appears bulky when wearing. Then I used them on a recent 11 hour plane trip and they came into there own, the lower level background noise was reduced greatly so much so that I did not have to turn the volume up at all to watch the movies and even when not plugged into anything they made a very noticeable difference.Overall I would defiantly recommend for them for air travel, their worth every penny."
2,Don't do anything worth the price,"I wouldn't say that they cancel noise, all they do is make what you are listening to louder when you turn on the ""noise cancelling feature"". I only notice the hiss when the music is not playing, but I dont notice it over the music. I got these becasue I spend a lot of time studying in public places for school and I think they also let out a lot of sound as well. So everyone else can hear what you are listening to (for those of you who are considerate of others). I hate knowing that everyone else can hear what I'm hearing when listeing to stuff through headphones(thats the point of headphones isn't it?) Anyways I might return these since I just bought them yesterday and pick a nicer pair of sonys."
2,Not very good..,"Not only do they not cancel noise effectively, they fit oddly on the head. Very dissapointed..."
2,Okay Headphones For The Price,"I bought these for airplane use and found them to be ok. That's it. Not great, not bad, but just ok. Compared to regular headphones, they do a decent job of ""cancelling"" ambient noise (airplane drone, background chatter) but they are uncomfortable to wear after about 45 minutes. They make your ears sweaty and put pressure on them during prolonged use. If you plan to use them for short trips they might be your answer. I was pleasantly surprised to hear that it does a decent job of blocking out noise but then again, this is my first experience with noise cancelling headphones. I ended returning mine because they were so uncomfortable but I can tell you from experience that they are a decent pair if you don't plan to wear them for more than an hour."
1,Don't waste your $,"The noise cancelling feature actually boosts noise in certain situations. Forget it on an airplane. The ambient noise was so amplified that I couldn't hear the music. The only situation I've found for these headphones is at the beach in winter. I'm not taking my $150 headphones there. Turn off the noise cancelling and enjoy warm ears, sand protection, and fair music quality. If they are stolen while you are playing with the dog, well maybe someone did you a favor."
2,uncomfortable design,"I returned these the day I got them because they were so uncomfortable to wear. They have a folding design, and there is a bump on the top of them that made me feel like a hole was being drilled into my head after an hour of use. The sound quality is decent, but I would pay more money for something that feels better to wear."
3,Good buy for the price,"I bought these headphones about a year ago and they have done pretty good. I bought these headphones so I could listen to my music on the bus and not hear the other 15 conversations going on. They work really well for reducing the noise level. I use them on the bus, at school, at the gym (with some success), and sometimes at home. They do start to hurt your ears after about an hour but you get used to it. The padding is very thin and is ripping but to my suprise they are still holding on. You can't really look down without them starting to slip down on your head and if you are at the gym and doing anthing other than the exercise bikes or treadmill then you will need different headphones. But if you are looking for a good pair of noise-canceling headphones these would be a good choice."
4,Better Than Expected,"Sometimes I like picking something up even though people gave it bum reviews. I got these at an awesome price ($13), and I'm very happy with them. Great bass response, good noise cancelling feature. There is a noticeable 'hiss' when you flip the noise cancelling feature on, but then again, I wasn't expecting the Bentley of headphones at a Ford Escort price. The only qualm I might have is a similar complaint as others; there is a bit of discomfort when wearing them, one side seems to apply more pressure than the other which is a little annoying. Overall, I'm very happy with this purchase."
5,ROMANTIC ZARAZUELAS THEMES!,"I highly recomend this cd to all those who enjoy the romatic and lively melodies of the Spanish Zarazuelas. On the other had it is MUST for all those, as myself, who are devoted to Spanish Dancing: the popular pieces are wonderful and ideal for choreographies in the ""clasico espanol"" - or classical Spanish - theatical style."
3,Mr. Weber refuses to portray Black Women positively !!!,Although the storyline was interesting I was truly exhausted from reading yet another one of Mr. Weber's book negatively portraying Black Women. This is getting old. Not all Black Women are heartless and inconsiderate as the women are in Mr.Weber's books. I am truly wondering if Mr. Weber has ever made the acquaintance of positive Black women committed to having loving relationships with Black men. This was the lastest book that I have purchased from Carl Weber and it just might be my last !
5,Page Turner!!,"I thought the book was HOT! As always, Carl has done it again with this one. I read the book in three days. The book was off the hook. I enjoyed it."
5,A MUST READ,This book was one of his best yet!!!!! A definite page turner!!I thought the books characters where realistic yet the drama was unbelievable. If your looking for a book that is sheerly entertaining and laugh out loud fun then look no further because BABY MAMA DRAMA is the book for you!!!!!!!!!!
5,Baby Momma Drama,"I could not put it down. The Characters were all so real. Carl is a wonderful story teller, going back and forth between the characters and the plots all coming together with surprises that kept me reading far into the night until my eyes were crossing.this story ended too soon.I can not wait for the next novel- and picking up again with the unforgettable men from ""Married Men"". Carl is fantastic!"
5,From Beginning To The End,I enjoyed this book form the beginning to the end. I read it in one day. That's how glued to this book I was. This is my first time reading one of Carl Weber's books - but Im sure it won't be my last.http://groups.msn.com/seasonyoursoulbookclubWe are currently reading/discussing this for my online book club. Join Us!!
5,"Baby Momma Drama and then some,",i loved this book well what do you expect Carl Weber is a great auhor noting he puts out is not bad he is the man when it comes to drama he hits it right on the nail especialy when it comes to women and men problems that we face in everyday life
2,"Pages Readers Group Reviews ""Baby Momma Drama""","We picked this book because we had read and enjoyed two of Mr. Weber's previous novels, ""Lookin' for Luv,"" and ""Married Men."" ""Baby Momma Drama,"" was an easy, entertaining read with a relentless amount of drama from the first to the last page. It was filled with the characters we love to hate; the selfish, scandalous, smutty, trifling, bossy, nave and unnecessary. And even though the characters lacked any depth, we were forced to keep reading just to see if any of them would redeem themselves in the end. We hate to say it, but one of the best things about the book was that Mr. Weber provided questions at the end, which lead us to a hilariously interesting discussion. Two Stars only. Ummm maybe we'll reread ""Lookin' for Luv."""
4,Like never before,"This is definitely a drama filled novel. Carl does deliver well in this area with realistic tales of everyday characters one might encounter or even exhibit similar behavior patterns in everyday life. The women in the novel are strong characters that I find myself referring to as the protagnist, because both Stephanie and Jasmine were coming from selfish places when it came to dealing with the men in their lives and other aspects as well. Much has been said about this novel and it has received raving reviews. Carl has done well to entertain, but this read lacks the simulation I desire in read, there is no profoud lesson that stands out. Although Stephanie did some soul searching it was brushed over and underdeveloped. I also found the story ran longer than was necessary to get the story across."
5,I love it!,"I love reading a book that I can't put down. This is definitely one of them. It's like I can jump right in, like I am actually there."
5,Just Plain Drama!,This was an excellent fast pace read and I recommend it to other bookclubs.Baby Momma Drama consists of several Main Characters. Jasmine who is dealing with her Drug Dealer Boyfriend Derrick and his Baby Momma Wendy. Jasmine finds herself falling in love with Dylan while Derrick is in jail but Dylan has drama of his own by dealing with trying to get over his ex-girlfriend Monica. Then there is Travis who is dating Jasmine's sister Stephanie who can't seem to stay away from her baby's daddy Malek. Stephanie risks her securee future with Travis by constantly getting tangled up in lies concerning her relationship with Malek.Will anyone be happy in the end? Hmmm .... You'll just have to read this hard to put down book. There are so many twists and turns it will have you glued to each page.Carl Weber has definitely done it again . I am looking forward to the sequel to Married Men in 2004 called Player Haters.
3,The title sums it up,"I found Baby Mama Drama entertaining, but not a superior work of fiction.When I started the book I could not believe how ghetto the characters were, but after thinking about it I realized that Weber is just keeping it real and that everything that happened in this book can and does happen in real life.To those who say Weber is a better writer than Eric Jerome Dickey, I personally think that they write for different audiences. I prefer EJD.This book is a testament to how stupid both men and women can be in romantic relationships. At times the book gave me a headache because the characters continued to make pathetic, life-altering mistakes. Is anybody really this stupid? I gave it 3 stars because I found it entertaining for it's ridiculous situations, but the level of character development and plot twists was average. This isn't a page-turner, but it's worth a paperback purchase price or loan from the library."
5,Married Men,This was an awesome book! It simply told a story and didn't male or female bash. The characters where very real. I think this would be a great movie!!
4,Great book!!!,"""Married Men"" was the 1st Carl We ber book I'M ever read & its my favorite, Baby MamaDrama is my 2nd favorite!!! I liked this book a whole lot more than I expected to. Jasmine should have gotten rid of Derrick a lot sooner & Big Momma got on my very last nerve. But overall the book was drama-filled & entertaining. I would love to see a second part to this book!!!"
4,Not the ending I was hoping for,"I thought the book was good. It had good charactors and a good story line. Honestly what happened to Stephanie, happens a lot. I'm not sure why some woman like bad guys but they do. Stephanie's lust for her ""baby's dady"" Melex may have destroyed her happy home! It was clear that the only thing Melek wanted was sex from Stephanie and ruining her happy home but what was Stephanie's new man to expect? He picked her up on a one night stand at a club and Stephanie's grandmother tried to warn him. I did not understand why Jasmen was stuck on that no good for nothing Derrick. I would have dropped him after he hit me in my eye and certainly after he let his ""baby's momma"" drive my car, that was crazy. What was up with Dylan, he was way to sensitive for me. I mean he cried at the drop of a hat. It is one thing to be a nice guy but he let Monica run all over him."
5,AWESOME,"Forget about what Publishers Weekley had to say, This book was the BOMB from start to finish! READ IT! Nuff said. :-)"
3,I was disappointed,"The book it self was good. But I was disappointed about what happened to one of the Characters, Stephanie. I think he should write a sequel so I can know does Stephanie have a happy ending"
5,A True Baby Momma Drama,"This book was exciting in that no matter how wild the characters actions my have seemed, a part of me could always relate to the emotions and underlying motives of the character. Don't get me wrong...this book is wild, but there's drama in all of us, and this book certainly captures it. It is an emotional rollercoaster that leaves you anxious to read the next chapter."
4,Talented author,"This was the first of Carl Weber's books that I have read. As soon as I was finished I bought and read all the rest. The character's in this book seemed as if they were people from my own neighborhood.I couldn't wait to find out what happened at the end of the book. I made sure to recommend this one to all of my friends. Bravo, Mr. Weber...Bravo!"
4,good,"I can say that i perferred Married Men to this novel, but it was good, Carl Weber is a great author, a lil grimey at times, but i love it !! ... I would recommend it if you like this author."
5,Wow This is Great,You will laugh. You will cry. I stayed up until 2 am reading this book. I just had what would happen to Stephanie. This is of the few books that I can say that I truly enjoyed. This is a must read.
5,Page Turner,I loved the book. It was very unpredictable and it kept me turning the page from the beginning to the end!
4,Baby Momma Drama,"You'll crack up laughing, shake your head in disbelief and talk out loud to the characters in this modern day tale. Perfect for a bookclub discussion with questions listed in the book."
3,Wanting more...,"I have just started getting into Carl Weber as a writer. This is my third book that I have read of his, this book was pretty good but reading his other books it seems his writing style has gotten better. I enjoyed reading it but I felt the ending could have been different. It made you want more..."
2,ugh,"I'm the type of person who finishes a book in a day. It's been at least a month and still haven't finished. It's a bit too hood for me. I'm trying to pull away from these type of novels because all it does is make me roll my eyes at the characters and look down on them. I will finish the book, though. I don't waste money. I'm trying to find novels that stimulate my brain, not promote stereotypes and dumb me down."
5,Pretty Good Collection From Three REK Albums,"Good CD if you are a casual REK fan. The selections are from three albums - ""The Live Album"", ""West Textures"" and ""Gringo Honeymoon"". If you are only going to buy one REK CD, I guess this would have to be it. But, if you are bitten by the bug like me, you will end up owning ALL of his music!"
2,Could have been better!,"This movie has a good synopsis, but the soundtrack killed it. The music just doesn't go along with the movie's story. The noises at certain scenes either startle you, or make you think something's happening inside your own house."
2,Blah.,"Can I have my money back? There was little on this tape that was either new or motivating. Also included were things such as time management, how to organize your DayTimer, etc. I was hoping for something that would help me deep clean my home, not my office. It was not helpful for my purposes. Unless you're looking for help at the office, save your money."
4,A Little Outdated but Helpful,"Okay, very outdated since its in cassett form but it has some good tips. They need to update it and put it on CD"
4,Criminal Personality - Vol I,This book is well written and understandable for those who are just getting started in working with the prison population. I look forward to reading the other 2 volumes I hae purchased.
2,Outdated,"This book is more like a catalog of 'occult' organizations; and the worst part is, of occult organizations of eighties. It is mostly outdated and it does not have much to offer. If you are writing a book or creating a roleplaying game which takes place in eighties and has something to do with -mostly pulp and subculture, occult organizations, it would come in most handy; otherwise, forget it."
2,"What a Ripoff! Sammy Would be Mad, and I mean that!","Alright Sammy fans, stay away from this CD! I don't know who compiled this but they need to be held accountable because this is more of an EP than a full-length album as almost half the songs are simply excerpts rather than full length versions! Big Bad John is only a sentence or two. MacArthur Park does not even contain the chorus, only a couple of verses and then it fades out. Why on earth was this CD even produced? It's almost the equivalent of the sound bites on Amazon.com, but in CD form! I only gave it two stars because at least there was a complete version of You Make Me So Very Happy that Sammy does in that Sammy way of his.I'm crashing LOW, man!Be wary of this ripoff, folks!"
2,Lots of better CD's available by Sammy,"I wish I would have read the reviews on this CD before purchasing. As they state, Gonna Build a Mountain is 23 seconds long, and Somethings Got To Give is 20 seconds long! For great CDs by Sammy Davis Jr, purchase ""At The Cocoanut Grove"", or ""Sammy Davis Jr/That's All"", both are very good."
1,beware: it contains songs that last 30 seconds!!!!!,"This CD is also available from Pazzazz label as a double CD called ""My Name Is Sammy Davis Jr."" It's the same crappy CD. It has 3 songs which only last 30 seconds!!Mentioned in the liner notes the fact that ""Gonna Build A Mountain"" reached number 26 in the UK charts back in 1962. This is one of the ""30 seconds"" songs. I find it hard to believe someone would buy a single that short even in 1962.The rest of the cd consists of some nice songs most of them recorded live. Total length of the cd is 30 minutes. Good thing this CD is cheap."
2,"okay, but gets tiring",IT'S ALMOST EXACTLLY LIKE SIM THEME PARK. AT FIRST YOU CAN'T TAKE YOUR HANDS OFF OF THE GAME. BUT THEN IT GETS BORING WAITING TO GET A NEW LEVEL. AND YOUR RESEARCHERS ARE SLOW. AND YOU ONLY GET A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF PIECES OF TRACK FOR THE ROLLER COASTER AND SOMETIMES THE ROLLER COASTER DOESN'T HAVE ANY LOOPS. AND YOU REALLY CAN'T GET HEIGHT FOR YOUR DROPS. OVERALL I WOULD NOT RECOMEND THIS GAME TO PEOPLE OVER 13. KIDS UNDER 13 MIGHT ENJOY IT.
2,UNCONVINCING AND STILTED,"I am university professor from a midwestern state university. In all my years of teaching I think I may have come across a student this bright and literate perhaps half a dozen times, if that. I found the dialogue between her and the tenure seeking professor unconvincing and so stuffy it's hard to believe. Mamet's writing, far more suited to the stage, is hard to take. It has the same clipped and far from real life tone as it did in ""House of Games"" (a far better picture, in my opinion). I do not see where this film portrays some big deal intellectual game between these two. I'd just have thrown her out of my office and tell her to the grade appeals committee."
3,Okay Movie,"This movie is very slow, and only focuses on two actors in the movie. It's about a student that needs help by her intructer; but takes things personal. To the point where she accuses her instructer of rape and battery. At the end of the movie, the instructer eventually loses his cool and beats his student up. Because of the students smart mouth, along with the students threats. This movie is better to watch on television; instead of buying the movie. Because this movie is very slow that is why."
4,Covering Tchaikowsky?!!,"I was drawn to this album by the most unlikely rethinking of the great scene from Tchaikowsky's opera, QUEEN OF SPADES, where an elderly countess is literally frightened to death. Previte has responded to it in a deeply sympathetic fashion, totally respectful of the original source, and not used just as a gimmic, and yet completely absorbing as a jazz composition! A great argument for disregarding borders and categories in music. After hearing this, I was totally into going with the other tracks on the CD, and on to his marvelous ""23 Constellations of Joan Miro"". Great stuff."
5,All motions seconded....,"This will be considered, I'm sure, a historical performance; Silja is genius. The singing, all round, is glorious, the acting credible, the conducting is fine."
2,Disappointing,"Anja Silja is someone I respect, and I am all for 'grey power', but this is a performance too far. In the opening scene her light grey trouser suit makes her look like an elderly Scandinavian tourist. She does not look sexually desirable. Her attempts to be sensual are simply embarrassing, as are some of the outfits she later fits into. Furthermore her voice has none of the mysterious warm colouring of Söderstrom in the excellent Mackerras LP version and is often stridently off the note. The supporting cast, orchestra and conductor are fine. The staging is ok, but not very innovative. Finally, why could we not have a Czech singer in this role, someone who does not have to strain to pronounce correctly?"
2,not pampered chef,the stone itself seems ok but the rack that is rests on is not at all like pampered chef.The part that is grabbed and taken out with a thick hot pad there is not room enough for your fingers. It is not very secure on the rack. So you must be very very careful not to get hurt in the process.
5,Very info. for any one wanting to become a profressional,"I learned alot from this book. It was filled with alot answers to questions that I had about entering the field. I would rec. this book for any one that has a love for dolphins or whales, I very much doubt you could find this much info any where else - even online I know because I tried. Def. an A+++"
4,"Very cute, but...","I love this little doll, I got it for my daughter so that she could have small dolls to take with us when we go out, since my son has hotwheels with him. The doll is adorable, my only complaint is that the hair on all of these dolls goes crazy without much help. They all have an eternal case of bed head."
2,Not what I was looking for,"I was looking for a book to help me with the original Hebrew and Greek meanings of the words in the Bible. This was not it. This book was not beneficial to me by itself. I could see that it was to be used with another of Strong's books but I was just looking for one book that could help me out a little with understanding the Bible. The one thing that really disappointed me is that there are absolutely no references to verses in the Bible. The book is a huge index with words and their various meanings, but where these words are in the Bible is not said. How can I know which meaning of the word to use when a Bible reference is not there? The reference that is there, refers to whatever other book this one is supposed to be used with. If you have that book then this should be a good addition to it (that's what it says). But I do not have that other book and so I was completely lost when I opened up this one to read it."
1,Strongs new English to Hebrew and Greek dictionary,"It could be ""a humdinger"", but some package ""stuffer"" didn't send this book that I ordered. They ""stuck"" a Strongs concordance in- instead. I have two of those already. I ordered ""The New Strong's Guide To Bible Words An English Index To Hebrew And Greek"". So far---not too good, I hope it gets better. Ralph. E-mail address:"
3,the heart monitor not working.,"The receiver is not working, could not even set timer. send back for exchange."
4,An exciting account...,"I read this to my children for our homeschool unit study on WWII. It is very exciting and exasperating. You think he is out of trouble but then he is in the ditch again! I would only recommend parents to read this with their children younger than the ninth grade. It has a couple of situations that you might be prepared to explain to anyone younger. Overall, I am glad we read it. My children are glad I read it to them also."
1,Please don't waste your money,"This is by far one the worst books i have ever read the characters all act the exact same with very little personality. While, I was reading this book I really think the author ran out of ideas because each chapter is the same. The boy is in the woods by himself and he finds a family to live and work for but eventually for whatever reason he gets kicked out and goes back to the woods the chapter ends,and then in the next chapter it happens all over again.....The book is 190 pages with very elementary words its a easy read(took me under 2 hours). Its a shame that this book won a award; especially a award for kids I think even kids would even understand how bad this is. Read an actually history nonfiction book besides this mess."
4,Worth Reading,"The book is well written and tells a remarkable story. It's a good book to read along with a teen/pre-teen to talk about what the reality of war, anti-semitism, etc. The fact that it is told from a child's perspective makes it all the more compelling. A few themes are mature (a brief mention of animals mating, a glimpse of a romantic meeting between a girlfriend/boyfriend), so I wouldn't recommend it for a child below the age of 11 or 12, unless you are comfortable explaining!"
5,Lizbook01 Review,I was extremely satisfied with the speed of shipment and the overall quality of the merchandise I purchased. Very positive experience with this seller.
5,Run boy Run,Really good bookI like so many people are nice to him.Good book if you are studying the holocaust
3,LOTS OF POTENTIAL NOT FULLY REALIZED,"CYAN, one of 3DN's last albums, is notable for featuring some of the band's original material rather than other composers and for its effort to progress from the expected into a more eclectic sound. Their familiar sound is present in the two singles, SHAMBALA and LET ME SERENADE YOU, and in tracks like HAPPY SONG and RIDIN THUMB. The best tracks: the lyrical and melodic STORYBOOK FEELING; the dark and intriguing SINGER MAN; and the religious themed INTO MY LIFE. Shame on MCA Records for not including the band members' names on the skimpy liner notes. Amazingly, the sound quality is very good. I wish 3DN had continued recording in this maturing fashion."
4,"Great concept, limitations in this video format","The idea of demonstrating classical ballet positions and movements on video is a worthy one, and the professional dancers perform ballet with an authority I cannot question.Putting 800 examples on two tapes presents the problem of locating specific sections. This would be much better served on DVD (or perhaps CD-ROM) where chapters could be more easily accessed. I own the tapes but would find a DVD version much more useful."
4,Intriguing!,"I have always wanted to be a ballerina and always fascinated about the many different styles and techniques, BUT, I didn't realize how many different positions there were! I loved this DVD, it was so fascinating and amazing at what these dancers can do. All the hard work they put in by conditioning their bodies to give us a beautiful outcome of a performance. The DVD shows different dancers doing different postions of dance. I have a deeper respect and love of ballet."
1,sound terrible!,Great material but it is not DVD quality. Sound has distortion. It is obvious that they just put VHS version on to DVD. Don't but this until they fix the problem! I hope the manufactor will refund my DVD. You can buy this DVD if you don't mind watching this great dancers with Buzz sound all the time. I guess you can mute the sound! Terrible quality!
1,it is bad,This is one of the worst albums of Merle Haggards Even though I am a big fan of Merle's .I do not like this one.
3,Not As Good As His Studio CDs,"If you love the absurdity and cleverness of Stephen Lynch's songwriting, you'll find better examples of it on some of his CDs. Many of his ""greatest hits"" ARE performed here, but they are hard to enjoy because of the non-stop interuptions by the live audience, which is only encouraged throughout the show by Lynch's pandering. After a short while, it's just more annoying than funny.Even worse, because of the aforementioned pandering Lynch does to his live audience here, as he does while stumbling through 'Superhero', he even manages to ruin songs that are usually irresistably hilarious.Hopefully, Lynch and/or his manager will soon figure out that he could be MUCH bigger if he would go back to putting more emphasis on writing and performing songs that are simply more clever than they are clumsily callow. Even more, though, he should make sure before releasing a comedy DVD that it's actually funny."
2,Stephen Lynch -Live at the El Rey,"I, personally, did not care for Stephen Lynch's act. I thought the one about Special Ed was hilarious but nothing more made me laugh....unnecessary use of the ""F"" word."
5,Stephen is even way funnier than Gelman (no doubt!!!!),"Stephen Lynch is first of all a very handsome young man. He is lovely all the way down (into his soul, I mean!!!!). And plus very funny and talented. This DVD is definitely worth owning for the funny things that it offers. ""Craig Christ"" is one of the most gut-busting, pee-making pieces of blue-chip comedy I've ever heard. If you have never seen Stephen Lynch live, I pity you. But this DVD is the next best thing. (And so is the vial of his sweat I bought off eBay -- nice!!!) ""Yeah, this is a nice, DVD. I'll probably watch it."""
5,Unbelievable,"Stephen Lynch is pure madness. If you are unaffected by taboo subjects, he is simply the best there is at what he does. I never knew these topics could be set to music."
4,"A must have for Stephen Lynch fans, but beware...","This is certainly a must have for any Stephen Lynch fan. It is full of material, and all of his popular songs as well as a lot of bonus material. It is shot in an open setting, not heavily scripted and edited like the Comedy Central stuff I had seen him in previously. He laughs, jokes and interacts with the crowd.But be warned, this is not the Stephen Lynch you have been introduced to on Comedy Central. The humor and content is exceptionally crude, more so even than I had anticipated. If you are alright with that, this is a great DVD and a very funny man, but otherwise you might want to look for something else because you are going to be offended, as well as finding yourself with a DVD you can't stand to watch."
4,Funny stuff,"Stephen Lynch - Live at The El Rey was very funny, although if you have any of his CD's (live ones mostly), the DVD seemed just like the CD. There wasn't much difference in the way he does his shows. Other than that, if you've never heard his CD's or heard anything by Stephen Lynch, I recommend this DVD... if you have a good sense of humor. Some of his jokes could potentially offend those whose humor doesn't match his own."
4,[Expletive] Hilarious,"Think of acoustic guitar fused with an angelic voice. Now listen as that beautiful music is perverted into something wrong and, perhaps, evil? Nah, it's just freaking funny! I love this guy's work, and my only complaint is there wasn't more material."
5,The Suspense is Killing Me!,"This is one of the best mystery writers of the last century. He will keep you on the edge of your seat, while biting your nails. A great read."
4,Strong Arm for Jeep hatch window,These strong arm supports for my rear window has made this operate as if it were new again. I recommend these to anyone who wants a great value and product. Lift Depot.com
5,"Soft, gentle music","Every song here is gentle and soothing. Honest lyrics, and sometimes very poignant. She sings from her heart and you really can feel and experience the emotions behind the songs. And there's a song for every mood."
1,Jamie Harrison is obviously not a Montana Native.,"Jamie Harrison writes fiction. That is the best thing I can say about this book. She is very obviously not a Montana Native nor has she tried to get to know Montana's people. Her dislike of real Montana & it's people is very apparent in her characters in that she gives them anti-Montana thoughts. I'm not talking about the imports, the foreigners, the people who moved to Montana because they had a fantasy. Her characters belong not in a small Montana town but in New York City or Los Angeles. The people in her book do not reflect the real Montana nor the people of Montana. I can't imagine anyone who has read Peter Bowen's books and enjoyed them would find her books at all enjoyable. I was angry through most of the book and did not enjoy it at all. Unless you are very Liberal and don't care that the characters are not realistic spend your time and money reading The Cowboy Way by David McCumber instead."
4,Learn more about this lesser-known European director,"In this wide-ranging book, Louis Malle discusses a majority of his movies starting with the 1956 Oscar-winning Jacques Cousteau documentary ""The Silent World"" through 1994's ""Vanya on 42nd Street."" Of particular interest to me were his thoughts on ""Atlantic City,"" ""Pretty Baby,"" ""My Dinner With Andre,"" and ""Murmur of the Heart"". Malle talks about working with the actors, writers, and editors on the different movies.The plots of the movies aren't really discussed, so you'll want to read the synopses of them in the back of the book before reading Malle's thoughts.Unfortunately, as with many other artists who deal with controversial subjects, Malle comes across at times like a moral relativist in some of the interviews, so that took away from my enjoyment of the book a little bit. But I did learn quite a bit about his career."
2,not good,"yeah, he plays the notes...but so slowly, so sedatedly, makes me fall asleep! I'm happy with Arrau's, supplemented in some of the weaker spots by Berezovsky. Don't need this at all."
2,Wait Before Buying This!!!,"Although these games are fun, I don't think they are worth the price ... I have played both and I can say they are good games but I would recommend you buy the ""Sim Mania"" pack instead. This is simply because for [little] more, you can get 4 other games with the ones shown here, including Sim City 2000 and Sim Copter which are worth the ...price tag alone."
1,SimTower is okay to kids. Simile is stupid game I ever,"played since I use PC in 1994. in fact, after I install thisgame, I couldn't find way to play it, so I put it in thebasement more than 6 years."

1,Very disappointed,My 9x 9 cake pan starting peeling only after a few uses. The non stick interior coating is coming off in large areas and rusting. Pan is unusable.
4,"Does its job well, coating isn't great","I bought this pan to serve as a general purpose cooking device. It does that just fine; cookies, brownies, whatever.The coating on the bottom of the pan might be sub-par though. I've given the bottom of the pan a beautiful cross-hatching design of marks from kitchen utensils. It should really be in an art museum somewhere. For now though, it's just going to cook sugary pastries."
4,Visually Captivating,The Beautiful illustrations in this book are a wonderful complement to a well written and interesting story about how wild animals rely on each other. My children thoroughly enjoyed this book!
5,They just get better!!!,I bought this for my daughter for Xmas. She has the previous series and she absolutely loves this one. I think she can relate to all of them better now that Cindy and Bobby are growing up. This is such a great series for kids of all ages--I still love watching it with them.
5,still entertaining,"These dvd's are forever timeless in respect to enjoyment they give to kids of today as they were for kids of yesterday. I ordered this season hopeing to give some relief to my kids from the presures of todays environment and they loved it, Seems I will have to order more seasons as they will want more. Sherwood Schwarts (sp) was a master!"
3,Pretty good,"Not as funny as the third season, but still pretty good. I would only recommend this season to hardcore Brady Bunch fans, or people who are really bored."
4,BRADY BUNCH BETTER EPISODES,"season 4 has 12 of my favorite episodes. hope the quality and audio has improved. than the last 3 seasons. i think cause of high demand for this release no time is taken to restore the footage in this series. so we take what we can get. i had bad tv shows on dvd. like land of the lost season 1, with audio and season 3 with blurry characters, lost in space season 3 with picture quality. but they had time to get it restored. after season 4 comes the last final season. which might come out in febuary are march."
3,Not so great,It is a bit of a pain (both figuratively and literally) to break off the little piece that holds the lights and slide it on the other end.I was using these to hang C7 lights from gutters and they weren't so great. They went up but it was not exactly a smooth process.
3,Very Good,"I have to say that watching this movie once and lingering on its setiment, its message, its cinematography and its agenda really made me like it. It follows the life of a school teacher in Algeria (North Africa) and how she manages to cope through being a victim of terrorism. It is not only a powerful conceptual movie in regards to what is going on in Algeria in the mid 90's where fundamentalists wanted to change the government structure, but also it was very nice just to observe how Algerians live day to day. I will never forget this movie. If you are into independent films that have meaning and also a cultural aesthetic, give this a try. Its not what it seems, although I highly appreciated it."
1,From the cuff and unsubstantiated...,"On a whim, I checked this book out of the library recently and found it to be more misleading than it claims RL to be. Those of you who consider yourselved to be to the left will not notice this problem, and those of you to the right will pick up on it easily."
1,trash,"I don't know what I was thinking when I purchased this book about ten years ago. It was a complete waste of time and money, who in their right mind would ever read such rubbish. The arguments against Mr Rush were completely off and erroneous. Don't buy into this media propaganda."
3,High school kids will hate it,"I bought this DVD on the recommendation of the previous reviewer. I am a high school English/Theatre Arts teacher and a retired actor who admired Mr. Callow's lusty performance in the film SHAKESPEARE IN LOVE, so naturally this witty actor's take on Dickens would attract my interest.But I warn you: this is a live performance, and his sweaty close-ups and flashy vocal athleticism soundly bored and bemused my non-AP senior Brit Lit students. Even my drama students, many of them well steeped in the gorgeous but old-fashioned orchestrations of Laurence Olivier, could only hang in with Mr. Callow for about ten minutes.Too bad, because it's a pretty good script packed with delicious tidbits about Dickens' life. If you're a Callow and/or Dickens fan, you'll probably enjoy Callow's technique, characterizations and lightning transitions. If you're a teacher, however, use this DVD to inspire you to perform Dickens' texts for your students yourself."
5,"bought it for one song, ended up liking more","I had initially bought this for the Bellamy Brother's remixed song, but ended up liking pretty much every other song on this album."
2,Diccionario Juridico not what I hoped for,"As a US immigration lawyer, I was pretty disappointed with this dictionary. It had few of the terms I looked for."
5,Comprehensive and Complete,This dictionary is well written and comprehensive. An excellent resource for judicial spanish/english translators.
1,All questions and no answers,"This documentary seems incomplete. There are only stated opinions and questions asked, I could only watched half the movie, many of which are at a basic level. If you are at the curious stage it is a good movie to start your learning but for someone more learned in this subject hold off."
4,mind changing,"This dvd completely changed my beliefs on the tradition and even the meaning of the word ""Occult"". Before this film, every time I heard anything about the Occult, my mind would immediately think Satanic worship. Now, I realize that my thoughts on this subject have been so far from the truth. This movie was an eye opening experience for me, as I'm sure it has been for all of the other viewers."
3,Love the Graphics!!,I thought the graphics were fantastic in this documentary. I would recommend it just for that. Also The interviews were very convincing and the controversy over all the misunderstandings makes you really put the film into perspective.
3,Mind Opening,"I have to admit I was a little leery about watching this film. Without really knowing much about it I pretty much had my mind made up that the occult was just something evil, dark and I didn't really want anything to do with witchcraft and such. Of course curiosity got the best of me and I decided I would take a look at this film and find out what is behind the word. Turns out it isn't quite as creepy as I anticipated and like many skeptics to the subject I now have a better understanding and more objective opinion of the subject. I think the pace of the film was a tad slow. I also think some of the image sequences and opening soundtrack created an expectation that the film would be more menacing and ominous than it actually was. All in all, the documentary proved worth watching and very informational but it is definitely geared toward those with an interest in the subject matter."
3,Delves Deeply Into What The Occult Is And Isn't,"This is an in-depth history and introduction to the occult. Instead of making it seems spooky or evil, the film shows the viewer that occultism is nothing to be afraid of. Throughout history there has been shamanism, ritual magick, and sacred practices that are still being practiced today.The word ""occult"" simply means ""beyond the range of ordinary knowledge or understanding"" but over the centuries it's become synonymous with satanic worship and black magick. Nothing could be further from the truth!I enjoyed the parts of this film that focused on L. Ron Hubbard and Aleister Crowley. If you're new to the subject of the occult or just want to set some fearful naysayers straight, this is a solid film to do just that."
5,Worth every penny!,"I just love this cookbook! Biba's recipes are well explained and go from simple and hearty to elegant and sophisticated! This is my northern Italian cookbook bible! Try the shellfish risotto, friggione, or tuna fish sauce recipes, and you'll see what I mean.Biba also includes seasonal menus which has really helped me alot with putting together dinners for my husband's Italian family! This is a great set of recipes and, if you like Italian food, or, if you're like me and don't really like pasta - this may be the book you've been looking for!"
5,A++++,The reason I chose Amazon was the price was great and my wife loved the watch!! I would recommend anyone to shop here!!!!!
1,DOA - Wasn't even recognized by my motherboard,"I ordered this card specifically for my Mediasonic 4-bay enclosure as I've been getting fed up with intermittent USB 3.0 connectivity issues (both with my Etron on-board USB3.0 ports and my PCI-E mediasonic USB 3.0 card) and reading reviews from others about it working well with the enclosure.Unfortunately the card was not recognized when installed in my PCI-E slot. It wouldn't even show up in the device manager and no amount of trying to install firmwares and drivers would help because the motherboard obviously couldn't even recognize the presence of the card. Not sure if it was just bad luck but it was quite disappointing, especially after all the heartache the USB 3.0 issues have been causing me."
5,Great eSATA compatibility,"I got the Syba SD-SA2PEX-2E card because my ASUS motherboard has been incompatible with a lot of external SATA drives. Operation with the ASUS SATA ports was intermittent and drives would either not be recognized or would report I/O errors.So far every eSATA drive that I have tried works perfectly with the Syba SD-SA2PEX-2E. The PC board is well manufactured and I have not had any problems with the card. I use the card with Windows 7 64-bit, Windows XP and Linux 64-bit. If you're looking for an inexpensive, fast eSATA controller card with great drive compatibility, this is the one to buy."
5,Works great,"Hooked it up to a SiI3726 port multiplier, and it found all of my drives. Looks like a good quality card."
1,Not worth the time and effort,"I bought this because I needed a eSATA port multiplier for my 4xHDD enclosure that has eSATA + USB 3.0.Installed the card in a Win 7x64 system and it installed default drivers. Updated to the latest from Silicon Image site for SIL3132 (BASE drivers) and BIOS and it ""seemed to work"". Untill the computer goes to sleep and I turn off the enclosure to conserve power.When the computer resumes from sleep and you turn on your eSATA enclosure it will not recognize any HDD. The same enclosure will work flawlessly when USB 3.0 is plugged in and you resume from sleep. Only way to get it working again is a total restart when resuming from sleep if you want to see the drives again in eSATA mode.If you start up the PC with eSATA drives plugged in, it will take for ever to boot up (5min with an SSD on OS ??)The whole idea of putting your computer to sleep is that you can pick up where you left off without having to restart.Even tried HotSwap! and it did not help."
2,Doesn't work with DQ77KB,"Purchased this to use with my new Intel DQ77KB motherboard. Applied the newest BIOS to the motherboard, but it just flat refuses to recognize this card (BIOS says ""PCIe slot not populated."")I suspect the card may be PCIe 1.0 while the MB is PCIe 2.0 and doesn't degrade nicely."
4,Don't Rant & Rave on Wednesdays!,This book is easy to read and understand. It has basic anger control ideas that children can use. I beleive that it should be geared towards a younger age group such as 7 to 11 year olds. It was a bit low end for my 12 year old. Good graphics and good ideas. Have the child read it and then have the child read it out loud to the parent.
5,Just what I was looking for,"This book is just right for children who struggle with controlling their anger. My 5 year old son is so engaged with the book, he carries it around and asks everyone to read it with him. I think it's reassuring to him that he is not the only one who struggles with anger. We also bought ""Don't feed the monster on Tuesdays"" He really enjoys that book as well, he is a little perfectionist and the book helps him to have a more relaxed approach to things going wrong and making mistakes. I love the books and can see me ordering the others soon."
1,Do not work in all pedals.,"Just received these and I'm sending them back. They just do not plug in fully to all pedals I own. They work fine in Boss, Electro Harmonix, and directly into either of my two amps, but just will not plug in fully, or receive a signal through Sansamp, Biyang or Catalinbread boutique pedals. The groove between the tip and the shaft is definitely about 1/8 inch wider on these than all other 1/4 cables or patchcords I have. I suspect this wideness causes them to not be able to click in fully on some jacks."
2,"Review of 6"" Jumpers","6"" is pretty short and will only work if your inputs/outputs are on the sides--too short if they are on the top. Also, it's the weirdest thing, but these 1/4"" plugs don't work in all of my pedals. They are too big for some of them. Odd.Merchant was great, so they get 5 stars."
3,all mine broke,"all 12 of mine broke within a year and the jacks got bent pretty easily. so I switched back to the plastic ones which have lasted me over 2 yearsHosa CFS606 6 Inch Right Angle FX Pedal Cable, 6 Packand they are still going strong."
5,"Exceptional, relaxing guitar music","This album has been one of my favorites for many years. To me, the guitar melodies are unique and catchy, yet very relaxing. The sound effects enhance a feeling of peace. The song titles really explain the selections. Each selection is a musical poem relevant to the selection's title. You feel like you are watching the Moonlight on the Manzinita."
4,"Not a freak to get ""Freak Like Me""","The funkiest song the Sugababes ever made has become a cool single. Even though I am not a fan of buying singles, this one is really a catch. ""Freak Like Me"" makes a perfect partner as a single to the album, from which it originated from, ""Angels With Dirty Faces"". Not only does it have the original and ""We Don't Give A Damn Mix"" of ""Freak Like Me"", it also has a great enhanced section which includes: the video, bio, lyrics to ""Freak Like Me"" and a wallpaper. The single also contains ""Breathe Easy"" a beautiful love song that fills you with warmth. ""Breathe Easy"" is different version to ""Breathe Easy;Acoustic Jam"" on the album.I would advise getting this single especially if your 'Babes fan.The Stand out track: ""Freak Like Me (We Don't Give A Damn Mix)"" as it is different to the album version and funkier too.This single belongs in your collection!"
3,"No, no....sorry.","This stuff is just OK. Its not great, and its not worth the price.If you want real jerk flavor, seek out Walkerswood Jerk Seasoning, and get the ""Hot.""That is the way to enjoy real Jamaican style cooking, this stuff....bananas? Give mea break!"
4,"Not very deep, but comprehensive","This book gives an excellent overview of energies and forces that are currently not recognized by the mainstream of scientific research. I share the previous reviewer's scepticism at the author's detailed knowledge of the many topics he writes about, so I would not recommend this book to someone who seeks to study a particular topic in detail. However, as an introduction or survey of the vast field of esoteric energies, it is more than adequate."
3,Nice compilation of a soul legend!,"These without a doubt are some classic recordings by Marvin, but the only reason i can possibly see me or anyone else copping this greatest hits collection would be strictly for the title song ""My last Chance"", due to the fact that it does not exist on any other of his greatest hits or anthology collections, which i think is somewhat sad. That song along with the live version of the ""Star Spangled Banner"" from the 1983 Nba all star game should be on at least two greatest hits collections."
2,Ecopac is for the birds,"Ecopac is for the birds, which is also what I want to give 'em. Actually, I'd rate the music and song sellection at 4 of 5, the other volume 1, the '60 at 5 of 5. But it is bad enough the teen's these days are becoming illiterate, but the record company must thinbk that ""baby boomers"" are also illiterate too since there is no booklet or liner notes. I went to the web site, [...], and guess what? This album is not on the site currently (on October 11, 2011). Hopefully I can find an extensive review somewhere that gives the sources and recording dates for the songs on this album.Perhaps I sould also consider a larger collection for READERS that comes with NOTES. Or maybe it is time to buy a whole book about Marvin Gaye with recording history and discography! Well, now I know what ECOPAC means and to avoid ECOPAC CDS."
3,Roman Bunka - 'Color Me Cairo' (Enja),"I liked this effort about as much as I enjoyed his 'Dein Kopf Ist Schlafendes Auto' CD (see my review). Bunka seems to do a decent job of fusing the elements of Middle Eastern music, jazz and tribal-like rhythms to create his own art. Tracks I was most impressed with were the twelve-minute ""Egypt Eyes"", ""Fathy's Fourteen"" and ""My-So"". Definitely an acquired taste. Line-up: Roman Bunka - guitar, Malachi Favors - bass, Khaled Goma - tabla and Fathy Salama - piano."
1,Disjoint collection,"This book is awful. It doesn't discuss the issues of Configuration management, it isn't a how-to book. It is a collection of disjoint material and results that would appeal to no one, or at least I have no idea who the target audience is. I bought this online and would not have purchased it at all if I had flipped through the pages in a bookstore first."
4,No murder until after page 100,"This is such a warm and cosy book I feel bad saying anythingnegative about it. I have to warn the squeamish that somebody says ""rats"", that one character might like men instead of girls, and someone appears on stage in a mini-skirt with a bare midriff (but her father drags her off). A married couple unplug the phone for a hour to do something. There's a lot of nailbiting tension about the plans for Aunt Ruby Lee's wedding. If you can stand all that sex and suspense the mystery is quite well plotted with fairly placed clues. It's set in North Carolina with thick local atmosphere but no mention of race problems (everybody seems to be white if their physical appearance is described). A good-humored blend of ""Divine Secrets of the YaYa Sisterhood"" and Agatha Christie. A neat joke in the acknowledgements."
4,Laura and Richard Return to Byerly for a Wedding,"Aunt Ruby Lee is getting married for the fifth time. Second time around to Roger of Rogers Ramblers. Their daughter Ilene is rebelling big time. She wants a career in music, but her father thinks it is no place for his daughter. She enters the local Music Jamboree with the assistance of her sleazeball boyfriend. The boyfriend ends up dead on the Rambler's bus and Ilene is accused of murder.This is a good addition to the series. Laura and Richard have to use their wits and Laura's pack of relatives to solve the crime and the reader has alot of fun in the meantime. A mystery from the past is solved also, which adds some dimension to the plot."
3,"Where's The Original Recordings, Susie?","There are a lot of compilations of Glen Campbell songs, originals with lots of hits in the package(s) on which I assume EVERYBODY gets royalties. So WHY re-record a different package without the original orchestration, etc. for MORE profit? How great would a CD, or even audio cassette, be with all certified hits, the ORIGINALS you remember? I'm being generous with 3 stars (I got to listen to an acquaintance's copy and saved my own money). You save YOURS."
3,The Sedona Experience,I love all Marks work and these were no expcetion but for me his new True Power Yoga dvds are the best of the lot [...].
4,Turning over rocks until finding beauty,"I strongly believe in this principle....just keep calling and prospecting. It is in the numbers. I always think of prospecting back to my experience in Iceland at age 17 walking across rocky lava fields. You can visualize turning over rock after rock with nothing of value, but somewhere there is a thing of beauty with embedded rainbow colors left by the flow. This book is helpful to several members at Exciting Windows! who do not like selling, but found that it helped them overcome their fears. Jacque Peterson in Colorado Springs introduced us to it, and we thank her for it."
3,"Good Storyline, Just O.K. For me!","Go For No is a o.k. book and quick read. Story was good. Does not rank in my top ten. Would say I was a little bit disapointed.The reviews that I had read prior to purchasing the book, had me thinking that there was more to the book.Still worth the investment, another book to have in the collection.Go for No! Yes is the Destination, No is How You Get There"
4,Go for No,"A Motivating story which is not only helpful with sales, but life in general. Much food for thought about asking for what you need and want."
5,Game Changer,"Go For No is very readable, but more important is the message. This is not just for sales people, but for all people that come into contact with other people. It really will change the way you look at personal interactions."
5,Change Your Philosophies - Change your success,"I highly recommend this book for anyone who is having difficulty in their business and not achieving the degree of success that they wish to have, especially if you are in sales. This book gives you a postive prospective on the negative side of talking to clients, prospects and building a successful career in business.Due to the philosophies I learned in this book it has totally changed the way I handle rejection and my approach to growing my book of business.Thank You so Much and I look forward to any future books and/or products!"
4,Short & sweet but big impact!,"A quick, easy read that shows what is possible once you get past the hurdle many people have - the fear of hearing ""no""."
5,"Yes Is Great, No Is Even Better!!","I received this book as a gift from a good friend who noticed I was spinning my wheels in my sales career and did it do the trick!! After reading this quick and easy book, I went on to shatter all my previous sales records! Definitely added fuel to the fire!!"
5,go for this book,Go for No is a great inspirational tool for coaching salesforce as well as coaching your children not to be avoiding the NO word.It is written as a humoristic story but you get alot of useful information on every page.Easy to read and light to bring with you in your bag!
3,Not what you would think,"This book is quick short read. Which with my busy life, it was perfect. There are some really good points to this way of looking at things."
5,Go for No!,"This book is an easy, quick read. It would be an excellent tool for nonprofit board members who are being asked to help with fundraising when they believe they ""just can't ask people for money.""Sandra"
5,Changed my outlook,"This was totally worth the price - its a nice short offering, doesn't drag out the concepts just to make it seem like its more than it is.Am making a transition into sales so maybe this isn't for folks that have been doing it for a long time, but the two BIG things I got out of this are don't place your boundaries on someone else and set out to get no's and the yes's take care of themselves."
5,Go For No!,"This book is an easy read and the message is so simple, ""Go fo No!"" you'll wonder why you didn't think of it. For anyone who dreads making sales calls, this book gives you a new perspective. After reading this book, you will look forward to making those calls."
4,Great Advice for Salespeople,"This book was very helpful to me. When you read it, you think right away -- that's so obvious -- why didn't I think of that approach on my own? I highly recommend this book to anyone in direct sales. I have given it as a motivational gift. I sell bamboo clothing and I go for no!"
5,Fantastic,"Great Book! Very thought provoking... I am really excited about applying the ""Go for No"" concepts to my business practices."
5,GREAT GREAT PRODUCT!!!,"This book is great. It is written in a manner that really pulls you in to the story. Its not just written in an informational format like any other book like this. It is actually a story. It will help you change your mindset about ""NO"" and will move you towards success in what ever field your in."
5,Go for No Great!!,This is hands down the best sales book I have read in 16 years! I have been in copier sales for 16 years so I loved that the story was about a copier salesman. Going for the no is the best idea ever! I can't wait for my team to start collecting their no's!!
5,"Go for No! Yes is the Destination, No is How You Get There",I purchased this book after reading reviews of others. Having a home based business I can remember a Sales Director saying see how many nos you can get when you are out there in the field or making cold calls. This book is a quick read and informational. Alot of the information in the book is basic common sense though and I would recommend the book to anyone who is in business for themselves. The book came quicker than I thought it would and the packaging of it was great too! Thank You!
3,Family Relationships in Later Life,"As the baby boomer continue their progress toward ""later life,"" interest in this period increases. This book is directed to researchers and practitioners in family studies and gerontology. Later-life families refers to families who are beyond the child-rearing years and have begun to launch their children. They are often multigenerational and the interrelationships between the generations vary. They are experiencing a number of new life events and the different contributors of this edited work discuss these various aspects and their impact on public policy. The major drawback of this reference work is that the statistics are dated"
2,Left with mixed feelings,"I didn't really care for the film. While my 4 year old did attentively watch it all the way through and asked some meaningful questions, I think it also left him with a significant amount of confusion. It's like all the people who think the wise men visited Jesus as a baby in the manger along with the drummer boy. Now I need to make sure he knows that there were no animals trying to save Jesus. The lessons that were taught could have been better taught in a well-done animated movie about Jesus without the animals. The writers also chose some different events from Jesus' life to better illustrate things. As far as the characters and the storyline, they are a bit cheesy. To each his own, I guess."
1,Kinds of a weird movie,"I thought it looked really sweet from the cover and the reviews. But the bad guy in the movie was way too menacing for kids under 10. The bad guy was trying to kill or enslave all of the dogs in Jerusalem. And Jesus didn't come to save animals, so it was a little too weird to base the movie on that premise. I prefer movies about Jesus that are accurate to the Bible."
4,Works as it should,"I havent really used the included back up program, but its great to hold large amounts of data. The only bad thing seems to be the case which seems like it should scratch very easy"
4,Very nice for the money.,"Hard to believe that you can fit 120 GB, (3x bigger than my current hard drive!) onto such a small piece of equipment. This has been a nice feature for both my wife and I as we both backed up our work computers and still have plenty of room to spare. The only fault is that I forgot to put this into my fire and water proof safe in case of a disasaster. Great hard drive and definitely worth the money."
2,Not so good,"Nice looking and all but did not last too long. The usb cable is to short. I felt from my desk and that was it, also some friend had the same one and did not last long either, they are not too portable"
4,good value,"Easy to use, cheap (get it on sale), and been reliable with heavy use the past ~5 months. I find the backup software useless and just use it as an external drive. Will be buying another for my wife."
4,This Hard Drive actually works!,"After suffering with a useless Maxtor 160 HD, this WD drive works as advertised. I wanted a HD that you could simply 'drag & drop' files onto the WD desktop icon - saved & done. Files can then be recovered or reviewed easily by clicking on the same icon. The USB power source eliminates one 110 V plug in from your setup. A final plus - the WD HD is compact - 1/4 the size of the Maxtor!The Maxtor HD required a schedule for saving files - totally useless - it made a nice hum (so does my clothes dryer) & the entry screen appeared on the desktop, but it never worked!! Want to buy it cheap??"
5,For my wife,My wife wanted her own hard drive to fill up with all of her craft pictures and descriptions. This was a good buy. The price was right and it was an easy install. She can now access this on our home wireless network and put all of her stuff in one place. Good product - Good price.
1,JUNK,"I had this drive for about 9 months, using it as a backup. It suddenly it stopped working, and I received an error message that the drive was not recognized. Needless to say, it was filled with very critical data, which cannot be recovered. I am very disappointed with Wester Digital. It is horrible to make a product so cheaply, which people rely on for such critical use."
2,Broke after 2 months,This thing broke down after a few months and i lost all my data. I shouldn't need a backup for my backup.
4,great product! except for the small cable,its a great portable hard drive..The only thing which was not as per the spec was the USB cable which is hardly 4 inches long.
4,Mac Problems with Insufficient USB Power,"What they say about this drive and Mac USB power is true. I spent about 2 weeks playing with this drive before I figured out that it needed a USB Y cable to power it well enough to work reliably. I tried it on a MacBook and a Mac iBook. I would guess that probably ALL Mac laptops would have the same problem. DON'T USE IT WITH THE SINGLE USB CABLE! If it works at all you will be playing with fire, and probably end up losing data. Get the Y cable. They are fairly inexpensive on eBay.Western digital says that a ""few"" systems are underpowered. That's an understatement for sure. They should provide the cable WITH the drive, or tell potential buyers the truth, and let them purchase an inexpensive Y cable at the same time the drive is purchased.Except for that it is a great drive and stores a huge amount of photos or other backup docments."
2,Noises...strange noises,"The first time I plugged this in it made a clicking sound and would not function. The next few times it didn't make a sound. Then, it started making hte clicking sound and not registering on the computer as a USB device. I need to take up this issue with the supplier, as I'm certain these drives are not meant to make clicking sounds and are meant to function every time. Not pleased."
1,WORTHLESS,"There was insufficient USB power on both my eMac and Macbook to run it. For ten bucks more, I had a Cavalry (powered) hard drive with 250 GB delivered to my door."
3,WARNING: WD SYNC software is NOT a backup program,"I can't say if the drive works well or not, but I can tell you NOT to use the WD Sync software provided with the product. It is a syncing software only, and will not be of any use whatsoever in attempting to restore data after a crash. I repeat, do NOT use the WD Sync software for backing up your data. Use drag and drop, or anything else besides WD Sync."
1,Failed after about 6 months,"This drive failed on me at a critical moment in the field. I had only owned it for 6 months, and it was not used very intensively. It spent its short life in my laptop satchel and was never dropped or otherwise damaged.During a photo shoot, I tried to copy data from my full laptop hard drive to the Passport. The drive simply would not work. It was powered on and spinning but the computer could not see it or use it. After trying to get it working, it began making clicking noises and I determined it to be dead.I'd hate to think that being jostled in my bag was enough to cause this drive to fail. If that's the case, then it has serious durability issues."
1,Failed in about 6 months,"Similar to other reported problems, I can't read the thing now (tried it on several different PCs). I definitely was not rough on it. I think it is hit or miss if you get a good one, but when it fails don't blame me if you lose precious data, as I did."
1,"Don't Drop it from 2-3"" height!","I had this item for about 6 months. I handled it very delicately until last week when it fell only 2-3 inches onto a carpeted floor, and it didn't work anymore. All my data is gone. Be very, very gentle with this item. Also for some strange reason it worked very slowly with my desktop computer, however no problem with my laptop. Now I'm shopping for a replacement."
1,Western Digital 120 GB Portable Hard Drive,"Western Digital WDXMS1200TN Passport 120 GB USB 2.0 2.5-Inch Portable Hard DriveWe had this product for 6 months and it suddenly stopped working with no warning. I lost my entire backup data. The product came with a limited 4 months warranty. Outside the warranty Western Digital require $14/- for technical support per incident, but no assurance of recovering the data. So baisically we have to discard this."
2,Dies within a year,"I bought the 120 GB passport more than a year back. Around 7 months after I started using it, I started noticing data loss. I ran a surface scan and was completely taken by surprise by the number of bad sectors on the drive. I had to send the drive back and get a replacement. My replacement has worked fine so far. However I had also purchased an 80 GB & a 160Gb passport before these issues cropped up. The 80 GB one died with no access to data. The 160 GB one is in the process of dying, I have managed to salvage some data from it however.The WD drives used in the passport does not seem to have a good life time which is probably why they only have a years worth of warranty."
4,Good,"Bought last month. Only used for a couple of times. Till now, I am happy with it. Easy to use and reliable."
2,RMA in One Month,Good Price for portable hard drive - you don't have to use this as a sync it can be for storage (don't know what other reviewers were smoking)..Loved it as a backup and PC Toolkit (I put all software I need to fix others machines - and for business software and 40 gig Itunes backup)..Seriously used it 2-3 times and now it is dead. Light goes on but must have been a bad hard drive to begin with - started RMA process and am waiting on replacement -- WD have had some serious reliability issues for years so it did not surprise me --Nice package if it still worked -- hoping my 2nd one will be a good one -- also I suggest using this for on the road backups not as your main backup as it may not be reliable enough for that purpose..
5,Take A Load Off Your Shoulders!,"If you are like me and need to travel with lots of image and design files - you will love thisportable hard drive. I'm able to tote not only sixteen artist portfolios and 4,000 museum imagesbut their backup high res - and marketing materials with me - just in case that unexepectedclient request comes in while on the road. So small & light you'll worry you forgot to pack it andthere it is in the bottom of your computer bag."
4,Stylish and small but scratches easily.,This drive works with my G4 ibook and my Windows XP PC that I built. Some USB ports in older computers might not be powered so you want to check this before getting a device that relies on it.Two problems I have with this drive are it scratches easily and doesn't come with a case. I put the drive into the pocket of my pants with nothing else and it somehow was scratched by the cloth. I really wish they would've included a case for it. Its parallelogram shape might make finding a case for it difficult.
1,USB Cable Bad,"As soon as the disk arrived, i tried it, but the disk did not work, i got in Panel Control, and i could not see it. I had to buy another USB cable in order to check if the cable was not right. The USB cable was the problem, I hope from now on the disk works well."
1,Piece of junk,"This drive is fragile. Do not trust it. The actual drive became loose within the case during light travel. I had to use a utensil to allign the port with its opening so it could be used. Then I plugged it into MacBook Pro and it stopped working, period. On a Mac or windows machine it will be identified, the drivers will load but no drive will actually mount or be useable. These things are cheap, sleek and cute looking but I would not trust them with any important data"
1,Great Until...,"I really liked this product until I unplugged it from one machine and plugged it into another, now no worky! Computer stills sees the drive, but says it's so badly damaged it can't do anything. Had the drive for maybe one month.I expected the drive to not be reliable for to long as I was traveling with it, but one month is a bit crazy, I hoped for a year."
2,Not Mac Compatible,"I have been trying to get this drive to work on my Mac Book Pro Core 2 Duo for over an hour. It isn't readable in OS X, but will work if I boot in Windows XP. So it's not a USB power issue as some have said. I reformatted the drive in NTFS and the Mac Book Pro will read it, but this isn't what I bought the drive for, as you can't write to NTFS from OS X. I tried to reformat it as a Mac OS Extended - and it did reformat, but the Mac still won't read it. So it's a good PC drive, but won't read/write with Mac OS X."
1,Lost all my data,File and folder names started to include gibbrish at some point and after that computer stopped to recognize the disk.
5,"Small, easy to install, room to spare","This product is just fabulous. I needed something to back up a lot of photos which take a lot of room. Single 1GB flash drives just were not enough. For less than $100 this is the solution. It installs on an XP machine with no fuss and you simple copy whatever you want on to it. It connects with a short USB cable and you can carry it easily since it is small and light. I may get another one for all my business documents.Highly recommended in this world of big photo, video and music files."
2,Not the most durable drive,"I purchased this drive to act as an on the road back up for my laptop. It's seen light use copying large files about once a week. Less than 2 months in, the drive is headed for the RMA heap in the sky - it now only has the ""click-click-click"" of the dead hard drive. Never been dropped, always stored in a soft case with other peripherals. I'm going to look for a tougher travel drive. (Several people have complained of low quality with the 160GB version of this drive as well.)"
3,Not a Horrible Product...,"For the price, I cannot complain a huge amount. It does what it is suppose to. My biggest complaint are the USB connections. The first one I received did not fit in the drive w/o bending it into place. Then it continued to fall out at times that were very annoying...The new one does not fit snug into my laptop. (I have never had the problem with other components). Would I buy it again? Probably..."
4,Backup portable hard drive,Western Digital WDXMS1200TN Passport 120 GB USB 2.0 Portable Hard Driveperfect size and easy to use to back-up hard drive - fair price.
2,Get what you pay for,"Great size and weight, it's almost perfect to move a lot of personal or work info depending on your field of work of course, many may need more space, but this is good enough for the standard user. A carry on bag or sleeve may be necessary as an additional must have for this small gadget.After two years of use the unit failed, and technical service was necessary to recover all data, the good news: all the files were recovered, the bad news: at the end the reliability must be elsewhere but far from this unit. It was never dropped, and it left the desk may be once a month (where it finally failed). Suggestion: read more about any unit before you decide to buy, and avoid looking at the sale price as an attractive pro."
4,Works great (once you BUY the right software),"Product works as advertised...although others have had problems, I had no issues with powering the drive via the USB port (even when I used the long USB cord that came with my phone). What WAS disappointing was the software included...it is intended for transferring data (like a zip drive), not backing up a hard drive.Well, I bought it to back up a hard drive. So, I had to buy some 3rd party backup software and it worked like a charm. The drive is stylish, works well, and is very quiet. I use it to back up my office computer and then I can bring it home (in case my office burns down or something). If you don't mind using Windows Backup (blech) or buying some software, it's a great product."
4,Works fine for me,I haven't had any trouble with my hard drive at all. It has been a great help to me for what I need it for.
2,Some problems,"I had some problems with this product, when I received it wasn't working. I called Amazon to change and they compromised to send me another one. In this moment I'm waiting."
5,Great Little Passport,"I needed something small and quick and the Western Digital 120 GB Passport has more than fit the bill. Though not as fast as Firewire, my computer doesn't have Firewire so the USB 2 is quite fine."
5,"The Best 2.5"" external hard drive","The best 2.5"" External HD. Smaller then the other model from WD, much smaller then the 2.5"" Seagate (I own the other two as well), 5400RPM, very slick. Had also couple of other (relatively unknown brands), they were very fragile though, no shock protection whatsoever."
3,The vanishing passport,"Although it's sleek, lightweight and beautiful looking I've repeated instances where the passport just disappears from my list of drives, sometimes in the middle of a copy. Very annoying. In truth I don't know wether to blame Western Digital or My Dell Windows 2000 box. However I don't have this problem with other USB drives. For some reason the sysem doesn't always recognize it. So bewarned."
3,Works on Macs but NOT out of the box,"I purchased this drive yesterday to use with my mac powerbook (G4). When I plugged into the USB port the drive would click and was not recognized by the computer. I plugged it in my wife's Windows PC and it was immediately recognized. I plugged the drive into an AC powered USB hub and then into my powerbook and it was immediately recognized and I am able to use the drive. The problem is insufficient power from the USB port on the powerbook. There are three options 1. Use a powered USB hub (this sort of takes the ""portable"" out of this portable hard drive) 2. Purchase a USB Y cable that conects the drive to two USB ports simultaneously (uses up most if not all of your available USB ports). This cable is available for $9.99 on the Western Digital web site but is currently out of stock. or 3. Return it. Personally I think WD should include the Y cable in the box to make the drive live up to their claim of OS X 10.1.5 compatability"
3,Windows users beware,"Windows users (possibly only XP/Vista) who are running higher-end computers, be warned: This hard drive pulls a lot of power from a USB port. Some computers running Windows will limit the amount of power available to a USB device. As a result, to run this drive, you will have to buy an extra cable from Western Digital (for about $18 with shipping) that will split the power load between 2 ports. In addition to the extra cost (WD will not foot the bill), you will have to have 2 USB ports available instead of one. WD claims that the product operates without this problem on about 90% of systems, but I had the problem on both a 3-year-old Dell desktop and a less-than-1-year-old Dell laptop (Inspiron E1505)."
3,In Panic,"[...]Read reviews on the amazon.com's UK site for the same product, people are crying out for malfuction occured after a few months using it!To me, I have just got it for a week, and the indicator light is dead. Since this product is manufactured in Thailand, my guess is it's a Hitachi Travelstar 120GB harddrive, all the external notebook harddrives I've bought before were Hitachies, and they all last long, I broke my last Hitachi by crashing it harshly to the ground,(was an accident) the drive itself should be ok, the problem could be the box, since the box is really light, WD's drive plus box weigh the same as a bold Hitachi drive. Maybe the box is soo cheaply made that it's not an ideal protection for the drive inside.I'll see what's going on, god bless me, this is my first WD purchase."
3,I am having Problem,"It's been two months that i bought this product, since then never have a problem using it till now; this morning i plugged it into my usb(like any other day)and it just doest not show the data in the hard drive. It detects the usb but I don't have access to it!Please I need help!"
1,Synchronization tool not a hard drive,"I purchased this item thinking that I could manipulate files and make room on my laptop hard drive by transferring them to the portable, but this product will not accomplish that. It allows you to share the same files between two computers, but will not allow you to view the files, move them, or have files stored on the portable without having them on your PC/Mac/Laptop. There was no indication of this ""synchronization"" process on the package or inserts. I needed to search the WD website to learn what this item is intended for. The website emphatically tells you to NOT use this to back-up your files. I have not doubt that you use it to synchronize files it will work well."
1,This good item,The company is big company so the product is so good and amazon the prise is good you must buy it.
2,OK .. But not Great,This hard drive is ok but not great. I had to return my piece due to some problem with drive enclosure and scratches on top of it. I still planned to keep it but this drive was slower than my other Maxtor 4mini drive which had 8MB buffer as supposed to 2MB buffer on this one. The write on Maxtor was much faster. I had to return this item and got my 2nd Maxtor.
1,NO GOOD AT ALL,"This External Hard Drive draws power off your computer, it shut my $799.00 Gateway PC Mid Tower down. When I would save even a small picture the monitor would make a noise like it was being loaded down, in 2 weeks it shut down. It's still setting on my table....WORTHLESS...STAY AWAY FROM WESTERN DIGITAL PRODUCTS FOR YOUR OWN SAKE. You can't expect any help from them either...."
1,Broke soon after used,I had this product for only a short amount of time before it completely failed. Now all the files I saved on it are lost forever.
1,does not work with powerbook G4,"I have used an Aegis portable hard drive without any problems, and purchased this WD as a back-up. I will be returning the WD as it does not work with my powerbook G4."
4,"Good but, you may need a special power connector.","Good product, but it does not work on all computers because you will need an special conector for the power, for this conector you need to use two USB conectors, one for the data and power and the other for additional power, but still works just fine."
5,Great drive,"Excellent drive, good value for the price. Not the fastest drive on the market (only 5400RPM) so it can't compete with the faster, but bulkier, 7200 speed drives. But then again, I bought it for back-up purposes so speed wasn't my main criteria. Western Digital reliability has always been rock solid in my experience, so that was my main selling point. The size is awesome, and the fact that it gets all its power through the USB port is icing on the cake. Perfect for traveling backup storage."
1,Broke after the first use.,"I used it only once, it crashed my system, and afterwards I couldn't access my files. When I would connect it to my computer it would make a ticking noise and just wouldn't work at all. I am very disappointed with this drive. I don't think it is reliable."
4,Una buena compra,"La verdad, el producto fue entregado en tiempo y forma, aunque la carcasa parezca un poco plástica, y no se puede extraer el disco, si es cierto que es un muy buen precio por 120 gigas de espacio."
2,won't work on my Powerbook,"This product worked fine on my Windows desktop at work, but won't work on my Apple G4 Powerbook. It doesn't show on the Powerbook as a disk. I tried Disk Utility and everything else that I could think of. I know that it's getting power because the blue light is glowing, albeit a weak pulse. I've got three other hard drives from different companies-Wiebetech, LaCie and Smartdisk-and a couple of flash drives that all work with my Powerbook without any problems at all. The lack of compatibility limits the usefulness of this product to me."
2,Western Digital not easy,I found this product extremely hard to use. There is no manual even though it states that you should refer to the manual. All correspondence is supposed to be done through e-mail which for someone who is technically challenged is not a feasible alternative.
4,Handy Hard Drive,"My only quarrel with this product is it needed a USB booster cable that was not provided. It works great, so far. I have a 60 GB version of this drive that has been very reliable."
1,Not Acceptable for Macs,"I plugged the 120 WD Passport into my G4 Mac and it didn't work. I then called WD technical support, waited on hold for 40 minutes and found out that an additional power cord would be needed (which isn't in stock). The WD representative admitted that sometimes laptops do not work with this product. If you want to use this device on a Mac for portable service, just recognize that you might have problems. I am returning mine for a refund."
1,Piece of junk,this piece of junk failed after not much use. No computer can recongnize the device. I will stay away from WD products.
3,GENTLE USERS ONLY!,"To cut straight to the point, you have to be EXTREMELY careful with this external hard drive. It's easy to scratch and also very easy to damage."
1,Windows XP stop recognizing device,"I bought the 120gb model and had a good experience for about 1month. After a month, the device is no longer recognized by my computer, or any other computers for that matter. I have only 20gbs of info on the drive, but it was very valuable information to me. Now I am SOL...looking for a replacement, but facing the sorry fact that I lost my info. How sad of an experience this has been. Live and learn I guess.P.S. There were many posts on tech forums with the same complaints and issues...this is not the first and only occurence."
1,"Doesn't work with my Apple PowerBook G4 (15"", 1.5 GHz)","This drive doesn't work with my Apple (Aluminium) PowerBook G4 (15"", 1.5 GHz). A single port USB power is not enough to power drive. Therefore, not really Mac compatible. You need a Y power adapter."
4,Have harddrive will travel,"I've purchased WD Passport drives for almost everyone in my office. Both the physical size and storage space make for a great portable back up solution. However, Power Mac users should beware! You will need to order a separate cable from WD to power the harddrive. A single USB cable (included) will not provide enough power to the harddrive. I also recommend purchasing a case with the harddrive. Even though there is a rubber port cover, the case can scratch and gets fingerprints easily."
4,gets the job done,"nothing flashy, but its a harddrive... does what it needs to do, easy to use, etc."
1,False advertising,"On the box it says that this USB powered device is ""compatible"" with Mac OSX 10.1 and above. That may be the case, unfortunately it does not work on many machines running OSX because there is insufficient power to run the drive via the USB connection. This drive simply does not function on my G4 laptop.In small print, it says ""A special cable is available for the few computers that limit bus power."" The FEW computers???? Give me a break Western Digital. Skip this drive. There are plenty of better ones out there."
4,Backup,I like these hard drives because they do not need a power hookup (get their power from the host computor). They are fast and easy to use.
2,"Not for me, but it could be just fine for you","This product uses a proprietary file system, and the drive can not be converted to FAT, FAT32, or NTFS. That's important information, and it should be on this product page. It wasn't.If you're never going to use another program with it, other than the program that you have to buy from Western Digital (WD Sync) to sync your drive (why isn't that in the purchase price?), then fine. If you want to use other programs that take control of the device and need to use NTFS (it's a more secure file system), then you're out of luck.Just like me!"
4,Portable Hard Drive,Great for Backup with Macshould have gotten more storage thoughworth to spend more
5,Portable,"This thing is great, i have had it a couple years now and it is small to carry anywhere, mainly stays with my laptop, but also transfers stuff to and from work. a great compact, portable hard drive!"
5,Awesome Hard Drive,Bought this as a replacement to the first one I lost (with all my work on it) :(. Same great quality as the first time!
5,WD Passport 3,This is the 3rd WD Passport 120G hard drive I've purchased in the last 6 months. All of them work great. I use them to store and to back up my music files to use with my Cortex digital player.
5,Useful,"This hard drive is the most useful drive i ever seem.No AC energy needed,it's small and comes with a Sync Software easy to do.Worths eath dollar spent."
1,Disaster,"As soon as I started using WD 120 GB, I started loosing my files. When I lost 2 hours work I figure out that this is happen only if I want to save file straight to WD. I call to manufacturer. As a result, representative decided hard drive is OK, but agree to replace it with refurbished. I paid full amount for new WD, this is outrageous by me.Full range of problems:1. I have 3 computers, two with XP and laptop with Vista. It works OK only with older desktop, but it can't recognize it through USB hub. It must be connected straight to the computer, which is not very easy. It can't be connected to the other computer with hub also.2. It is possible to loose file even after using it for 5 minutes. File will be lost completely, not only new data.3. The only one way to use this WD, is to copy file on desktop, work on it and copy back."
3,Wonderful,"This is a wonderful story. I'll not give a summary of the book but it is one of the best Singaporean novels I have read. Not as good as God of Small Things of course, but good enough."
4,Initial training of future Certified Nursing Assistants,Very appropriate language and amount of detail. Not as overwhelming as many texts while providing sufficient scientific fact. Not as many illustrations of skills as I would like to see - i.e. text explanation of how to make an occupied bed or take a blood pressure but depends on instructor or other resource for demonstration of the skill.
1,No English language track!,The lack of a language track in my native English marred for me what promised to be an excellent movie. What a disappointment Amazon. Filtering on Language would be useful.
5,A Strong Buy for anybody interested in management,"Managers, who have not yet read this book, should rush to read it from cover to cover. Hungry Spirit should be included in the reading materials for all MBA programs."
4,a new thoughtwave,We in India are now trying to give a new spiritual touch to management because that is the only remedy for the growing materialism. Charles handy has exactly striked that point.
1,"not so ""superb"" condition","The book, although on time, was quoted as being in ""like new condition"", with an additional comment stating that it was in ""superb condition"". I bought from this particular seller because of this, paying more money than I could have for another copy in ""good"" condition. The copy I received had multiple tears in the cover, which would have been acceptable, but when i opened up the book, I found that the binding was broken at the 2nd page. I would hardly call that Superb. Maybe the cover is in Decent condition, but I don't judge books by their covers."
5,my favorite season!,"I bought this for my mom for Christmas, and it just so happens to be my favorite season as well. :) I was pleasantly surprised that it was also the lowest priced Frasier season. Double yay! It arrived early, saved money and made my mom happy. Five stars!"
5,Fraiser,This is one of the best Series EVER. I was so sad when it ended. I enjoy watching the series on DVD. It is witty and funny. The actors have such a chemistry and they make the viewers laugh. It is a great stress releaver for me. I just wish there were more episodes so I could continue laughing!!
3,Frasier is OKAY,When I watched Cheers I always thought that Dr. Krane should have a spinoff. I like the show. My problem is with the Niles Characher. He and Frasier are too similar in my own opinion. Also I think Niles was just a replacement character for Lillith. I think she should have been on the spin off. Also I never believed the dad character fit in as the father of these 2 snobs. Funny show but like Friends its a little overrated.
4,"Fantastic episodes, more special features and subtitles needed","I love all the episodes they are really funny and entertaining. But i don't have very good hearing and there are no subtitles at all! At least the ads are skippable on the first disc. Also, it would be nice to see some special features for once aswell."
5,Frasier 7th,Excellent dialogue and wit. The comedic talents of Kelsey Grammer and David Hyde Pierce are outstanding as well as the rest of the cast. This season has the same high quality writing and directing as the prior six seasons. This is a highly recommended DVD set if you enjoy high brow humor with down to earth banter and wit.
3,not as shown/described,I ended up returning this product twice because it comes in a standard dvd case not the box like all the other seasons. Amazon was very easy to work with when trying to return it and get a refund.
2,FYI,Please not that this set comes with SIMEARTH and the game POPULOUS:THE BEGINNING which is a sequel (prequel technically) to POPULOUS and not the original. This is an important distintion for those of us who think the original is the far superior offering.
2,aung,"this selling company is cheating. This book's cover page seem interesting but inside the book was nothing, not valuable."
5,Good movie for teens.,As a high school teacher I spend the first quarter of the year in our freshman class teaching Internet safety. Cyberbullying is something I include in that. This movie is perfect. Held their attention and makes the point that cyberbullying can cause real pain and harm to others. I would recommend this not only for teachers but also for parents of teenagers.
3,good movie but skip,"I bought this dvd because i like the movie and its message, thevonly thing is i can't watch the whole thing because it won't play without skipping. I know its not my dvd player because i just bought that and all my other movies work in it. only this one skips. i don't discourage anyone from buying this movie by any means but this is what i am experiencing. and the move is brand new"
3,It's fine for what it is,"I bought this because of the other stellar reviews. I am an eighth grade reading teacher and have been for 20 years. So I'm looking for a new, exciting way to teach about the Holocaust and bullying and how they would tie together. I was looking to use this film. I don't know if I will. It's kinda corny and from my adult eyes, well, very predictable. The diversity of the children is really, really lacking....mostly white teenagers in this video and that's not realistic for me to use in my classroom. Maybe if I taught a younger crowd...but I can see my students totally not getting into this at all."
2,No subtitles on this movie.,I'm deaf and need have subtitles. This dvd is not allow have subtitles and either my tv. It hard understand about what they talk about. I'm not happy.
5,Great movie,"This is a great movie, geared towards mostly younger teenagers. A good watch, especially for teenagers going through cyber bullying. Shows that there is light after the dark."
5,Very enjoyable,"Mr. Thomas' book would make a great introduction for someone interested in buying a first handgun. If he had only written it about ten years earlier, I could have saved quite a bit of money and avoided some purchasing mistakes. In addition, his chapter on Alvin York's courageous actions during World War One are a must read."
3,An opinion from an expert,"This books is totally frank and to the point, which is refreshing. You'll learn a few things you won't learn in gun magazines. Being somewhat well read on the subject, though, I found only about 2/3's of the book informative. If you are totally new to handguns, this book is a great investment. It will give you some inside dope of how to interpret a lot of hype in the gun business, and there's a lot of it, just like in any other industry.Thanks, Duane, for the pointers. I've already used some of them just one day after reading your book."
2,12 shades...not up to par with Guit steel and Semi Crazy,"Well, Being the Junior Brown fan that I am, I had to go out and get this cd. I got Guit-steel first, and that album will probably always be my favorite. Semi-crazy came next, and I also enjoyed it immensely. But 12 Shades of Brown just didn't do it for me like the other two. Granted, some of the songs on the album, like Freeborn Man, are just excellent, but the album as a whole in my opinion doesn't compare to his two previously mentioned works."
5,Love these things,"In western mass i had ripe tomatoes by the 20th of june, outdoors. Normally won't see tomatoes until late july. Love these things."
2,Works Fine but Quality is Poor,"The Wall o Water really works well. I had 4"" of snow on top of these little hot houses and the tomatos did not suffer a bit. My issue is the poor quality. I had a 50% failure rate out of the 12 I purchased. Most leaks occured at the seams and were impossible to fix with the equally worthless patch kit. Seems like for the price they could do a much better job of quality control our use more durable materials."
2,More Chinese junk!,"I think this is my last year for wasting my money on these things. I have had nothing but problem with them splitting and losing water. The concept is good. The manufacturing is typical of Chinese products. In fact, I've just about had it up to my ear lobes with Chinese junk."
1,Bad Quality Control,"I have used these in the past and just bought three packs. I installed two of them and within a day, they had collapsed on my plants. The reason - poor manufacturing - the seams were not closed enough to hold water in the individual chambers. This is just plain poor QC - it ruined my plants. Too bad because this is a product that has worked well for me for many years..."
4,Nice product,"Works well. Just fill with water as high as needed and it will do the rest. I do get some algae growing in it after a couple of months, but I don't think it hurts anything."
1,Do Not Buy these Walls of Water,"We order two three packs. These are extremelty cheaply make. When we added water, 5 of the 6 had their seams fail so we ended up with a circular blob. The one that did not collapse save the tomato it was on when we had a freeze a courple of days later. Needless to say we lost the 5 that did not have the walls.Again I would suggest you look for another brand that has better heat sealing of the seams."
3,Not what I expected,"I found most of the book to be uninspired, the narrative really picks up in the decription of the battle for Mexico City and seige of Puebla. Other wise the text is below average. The outstanding features of the book are the charts that list the roster of units for each side for the significant battles, really a sign of outstanding research. Also there are maps of all the major battle, very simple maps but they really help gain a better understanding of the ground and positions of each army.If you want a better understanding of uniforms go to:MEXICAN-AMERICAN WAR 1846-48 (Brassey's History of Uniforms Series) by Ron FieldThe best narrative of the war is:The Mexican War, 1846-1848 by K. Jack BauerFor a better understanding of the US army itself I suggest:Mr. Polk's Army: American Military Experience in the Mexican WarArmy of Manifest Destiny: The American Soldier in the Mexican War, 1846-1848 (The American Social Experience)"
5,Paula,I happen to know that this product works and you can purchase by many companies and most all of them work. My suggestion is to shop around for a less expensive shipping charge. There are many mag sprays on the internet. My review is 5 stars because this is a great product.
4,great playing strings,Prince Synthetic Gut:Great playing strings and easy to string with...perfect for any racket and great for intermediates to advanced if you like good power and touch!Ray Danganan in Frederick MD USRSA/USTA
5,Great sub,"I thought this sub wont be able to hit hard , but it actually does and it sounds clean. I have the sub underpowered and it still performs well with a lot of bass. I modded a logitech x-540 speaker system and took out the original 5"" sub and added this dual sub and it work great ."
4,Not Bad for the Money,"My previous sub died, so I was in the market for something that would just add a little bottom without making the whole car bounce. I'm running a Dual 400w amp, so I figured I would try their sub too. The sub is mounted in a MDF box.I had the speaker within three days of placing the order, so that was great.I was a little concerned about the size of the magnet, which seemed much lighter than its predecessor. However, overall this sub seems to work as promised. It moves enough air to really get a good ""thump"" without being overbearing.There are probably better choices, but I know for sure there are much worse products out there. I just hope it lasts."
3,Dark Picture & Light Picture,"I agree with both of the other current reviews. It is a nice DVD, with nice music (or crackling fire noise) and a nice picture, but only when the fire is fully lit. The rest of the time the screen is either 1/2 black or 3/4 of the way black, which I find very odd. This changes frenquently, but stays black or bright for quite a while before it changes. When the fire is fully lit, it's very pretty. When it's not fully lit, you have a very dark screen with only a little fire light. Probably best used if you are moving about the house doing other things, versus sitting in front of the TV watching the ""fire"". I do think it's a nice DVD, just be prepared on what to expect picture wise. The music is a variety of classical, jazzy, and modern Christmas songs. Something for everyone."
5,when political debate had substance,"""Arguing the world"" shows that a thorough Marxist education makes for a incomparably stronger political debate culture than anything we experience today!"
4,Good description of Sonet and SDH,This book is interresting for those who are beginning to work with SDH or Sonet Networks and includes a part on synchronization. It is a practical book who does not go too much theoretically in complicated concepts.
3,"Ok, for the money","I bought this for my classroom, and it survived two years and a Hurricane season in Miami, in a portable!. Now, since I moved, the motor is making a sound, that gets louder and louder. So, it's okay, but I have a feeling that it's not going to last that long. VB"
4,Looks good,"I received this item packaged well but missing the hardware. I had to go to the local hardware store to purchase the screws to attach it to the bracket. Other than that, this is a quality item that is a little overpriced."
3,Could be better,"Good buy from Amazon, however the hardware included was very cheap, threads were all chewed up. used my own hardware. That is why I deducted 2 stars. Other than that, good hitch cover."
1,Abysmally Written,"Almost certainly the manuscript never encountered a single professional editor. It is terribly written and infuriatingly repetitious (yet shallow). One cannot but sympathize with the renowned physicist whom the author interviewed.If you are interested in quantum mechanics and in particular in entanglement, a cursory search of the Internet will yield much more accurate and accessible information."
1,Interesting topic but poorly written book,"The book bounces between amusing personal anecdotes, and terribly superficial scientific explanations. Graphical data and experimental drawings are included with little or no explanation...for what purpose? As the book progresses into modern times the writer gets into stream of consciousness name dropping,adding nothing to the story. The book started out well, but soon wore itself thin to the point of meaningless drivel. The reader is left asking, so what?"
4,Pretty good stuff,"Excellent history showing how much of the quantum weirdness was discovered. I really enjoyed the personal stories of the scientists that made these discoveries. However, not enough detail was given when it came to EPR and how the results pointed to non-local reality. Otherwise, it was a great read and well worth the money!"
3,great for history and context,"> ""should be recommended reading for Accounting majors.""Not sure it's needed for accounting majors.I make a brief reference to Pacioli in my Accounting Systems class. In that Queen Isabella being one of the first venture capitalists, used double-entry accounting, a la Pacioli, to make sure she got a return, and saved her country and her reign.I try to liven up why the study of accounting is important. It was interesting to learn that Pacioli ""only"" documented and popularized the Venetian Method of accounting, and did not invent it, as popularly thought."
3,"SimCity rules, but Streets isn't what you think","...Now on to Streets of SimCity. This game stinks. The graphics are bad, and though you might think driving through your own SimCity 2000 cities is cool, it's not. The main premise of this game seems to be shoot-em-up driving, though there is a mode where you can just drive. Compared to games like Midtown Madness, it is one of those games that Maxis slopped together and hoped would sell. Rating: 1 star.Overall: If you can't find SimCity 2000 alone, buy the bundled SimCity 2000/SimCopter pack. Don't even think of getting Streets of SimCity unless you like throwing money down the drain."
1,Was this book a Joke?,"This book, if it was meant to be serious, was without a doubt the biggest load of crap I have ever come across. Honestly, encouraging women to become addicted to speed in order to stay thin??? What is going on with the world?? I really hope that no young and impressionable girls read this and take it to be truth. On the other hand if this book was supposed to be a joke, then it is hilarious!"

5,"Loved the story, DVD really stank though!","Well to the reviewer of this film that said he wanted the DVD of it, I can only say I hope yours is better than the one we got! All four discs in the new factory sealed copy we received have some major problems, they'll play fine for a bit and then all sorts of lines, fuzziness and sometimes even pauses occur and are most distracting.As to the film itself, we loved it! It is an interesting form of docudrama and we learned much watching it, not just about Verdi, but the changing world he lived in and his part in it. The sets are gorgeous and long as this version is, it didn't drag for us, we couldn't wait to get to the next installment to see what happened next.I didn't find the narrator annoying, just the awful quality of the dvd! If I can find it in video format I may just buy it."
1,My comment to Rolando's review (up here for easier visibility),"I have wanted this but the many terrible reviews of the recording put me off; one star based on those, not on my own experience. I was tempted to give this item 5 stars based on my opinion of the recording below:Thanks to Rolando Creagh's review, I was able to buy the superior 7 DVD (PAL, use your PC) version from Spain on eBay.es:""La Vida de Verdi - Box 7 Dvd"" at DVD.es, who had two copies on eBay (now one copy, but use the seller's email address to seek more):La Vida de Verdi - Box 7 DvdItem# 110712694172 43.50 EUR 1 43.50 EURShipping and handling 22.50 EURInsurance - not offered ----Total 66.00 EURPayment 66.00 EURPayment sent to arcoceleste@arcoceleste.comFrom amount $90.31 USDTo amount 66.00 EURExchange rate: 1 U.S. Dollar = 0.730816 Euros"
4,A Very Special Series,"As lifelong opera lovers who toured the Verdi sites covered in this series -- Le Roncole (now called Roncole-Verdi) Busseto, and Sant' Agata -- we have a special affection for ""The Life of Verdi,"" which we first bought in videotape format. It doesn't have the usual kind of dramatic script but brings Verdi, his family, his fellow musicians, and his compatriots to life by narration and excerpts from actual letters and other first-hand references. The viewer is immersed in all of the best-loved arias and orchestral passages from his operas, while learning about nineteenth-century politics in the city-states that finally became a united Italy. It is a stunning achievement, but a bit slow moving at times because of the lack of the kind of dramatic dialogue one expects in key episodes. -- Phyllis & Howard"
3,THE CONTROLLER CAME WITH A PLAY N CHARGE BATTERY PACK!!,WHEN THE CONTROLLER CAME IN THE MAIL I LOOKED AT IT AND REALIZED THAT INSTEAD OF A REGULAR BATTERY IT CAME WITH A PLAY N CHARGE ONE. AND I DONT HAVE A PLAY N CHARGE CABLE SO WTF AM I SUPPOSED TO DO... OTHER THAN THAT THIS A GREAT CONTROLLER BUT NOT WORTH THE PRICE THERE ARE OTHER GREAT CONTROLLERS OUT THERE THAT LOOK BETTER THAN IT AND ARE CHEAPER...
5,Nice effects for the controller,"Bought this for my son...he liked the Halo 3 effect to it. Works just like any other, but it's ""really cool looking."""
5,It's a controller dude,"Ok. Its a Microsoft controller. Same as the original, just a different design. However, the left edge of mine is not exactly flush, which creates a rough edge. Not a big deal. No brainer here."
3,Not worth full price,I now have 2 of these. I first paid $45 from TRU. The right bumper played like it was already worn out. I got my second one from Amazon for $35. I have not opened it yet but I hope it's in perfect condition. I like the grafix. Buy black rechargables to match battery pack for this control.
4,xbox 360 halo 3 spartan controller,"At first when I bought this item I wasn't paying much atention to it, until I had it in my hands it was awesome the way it looks and feels. A totally diferent experiance whan playing halo 3 with it. the colors and texture give controllers ahole new meaning"
2,It works... I guess. But why so complicated?,"What's with the extra tiny button for synching the controller to the Xbox? Why do other wireless devices succeed without this button? Why does the PS3 wireless controller have nice re-chargable batteries that charge off the USB port, and this one doesn't? Inquiring minds want to know.The size is nice though. I still think theGAMESTER USA FPS Master for Playstation 2is the best controller ever, end of discussion, and I'm trying to build a setup to use this controller with Xbox 360. Hopefully it will work.Sincerely,Ira Carmel."
4,it's the same thing.,"as the regular xbox 360 wireless controller, with a glossy surface. my only complaint is that it makes my palms sweat more than my regular xbox 360 wireless controller."
5,Awesome controller!!,My son loves this halo controller. The graphics are cool and the controller is well made.
1,First class piece of junk,"This is the worst controller I have ever used. It looks great on the outside but didn't even last a year. I got this for Christmas and within 2 months the left bumper broke. I still used it up until recently, now everything moves to the left even if you're trying to go forward or to the right. I have the original controller that I have had for going on two years and it still works fine. Maybe mine was an exception since I see it got pretty good reviews, but it was an expensive exception."
3,Not a scoring tool plus scraper - this is a scraper only,"This is a scraper only, not a scoring tool plus a scraper like it shows on the package. The package shows a picture that implies the yellow knob is a scoring tool. It isn't and it doesn't come off. This is just a wallpaper scraper only. Had I known that I wouldn't have bought it as I need the scoring tool as well. I'll update this after I've had a chance to use the scraper. I think the packaging should be more clear as to what exactly you are getting.Edit: The scraper itself works quite well but it seems like the blade gets dull quick. If you have a large project, you may want to pick up the replacement blades as well because I didn't even get an area of 8 feet high by about 4 feet wide finished before the blade got too dull. You can flip the blade around to use the other side, which helps. I give it 2-1/2 stars because of the misleading packaging."
1,junk,"The omron mc-514 is a real hunk of junk, the product does not work as described in the instructions, the warranty as described is a futile pursuit. I will avoid this seller and in particular this product. Smart Gear was the seller thru AmazonOmron MC 514 Ear Thermometer with Advanced Temperature Scanning"
1,Did not work,"This product looked great and seemed easy to use. Unfortunately it was inaccurate and because it was past the 30 day return policy I had to deal with the manufacturer who informed me it was a two year old product. I tried replacing the battery as they suggested. Still it was inaccurate. Ultimately HRM refunded my money as I called them on the two year old product finding, however they did not refund the $6.00 I spent on the battery and no apology for selling me a two year old product was forth coming (the 5 year warranty would have been nearly 1/2 up if the product had actually worked)"
1,Piece of junk,"I bought this item on Amazon for $19. It arrived very quickley. I tried it five times on myself, and never got the same temperature twice. Maybe it's not really the thermometer, maybe I have some rare disease that my temperature fluctuates constantly, but I don't think so.....I tried to return the item, and found out I can't return. I normally have great experiances with Amazon, but this wasn't one of them. Don't waste your money."
2,Nice thermometer but couldn't get it to work.,This seems to be very well made with little plastic covers that go over the part that goes into the ear to keep it clean. Good directions also. Nice little kit but I couldn't make it work. I found it hard to work with. Maybe the nurse pros know how to use it but we couldn't get normal consistent readouts from it. Amazon was very good and refunded our money.
4,Ease to use and quick,"I bought this for class and most likely will be buying a new one that is more professional in my opinion. It's very quick and very easy to use and gets the job done. I am a tiny bit skeptic on how accurate it is. I compared to the ordinary oral thermometer and it was a degree below, but who knows which is right. Again on a professional level I'd get something else."
1,Piece of garbage,"I threw this in the garbage yesterday -- so it was easy to title this review! We got this thermometer because there were no Braun available on Amazon when we were shopping, and boy, I wish we'd waited (it's what others had recommended to us -- we're back now to buy another one).We followed the instructions of the Omron precisely. Put in ear canal. Listen for one beep. Press button. Listen for more beeps. Check temperature. And the temp consistently read crazy low (like, impossibly low for a feverish child). We tried again over the weekend when our 10-month-old was burning up and acting lethargic. Guess what? A reading of 94.6 degrees. Same thing happened with her older sis.And can I please speak to you parents out there directly and tell you that there are few things more frustrating and painful to try to get a temp reading off of a cranky sick baby or child and then have it be so horribly off?Do not waste your time. Garbage, garbage, garbage."
1,Constantly replaced battery and still didn't work,"We purchased this item for ourselves and for our son upon the birth of the grandchildren. From day 0ne it never worked properly. We kept replacing batteries and it still wouldn't register. We returned them for an exchange and after several days, it also registerd that it needed an new battery."
1,hard to use on babies,"This is practically useless when used to take the temperature on a baby.It requires for the baby to be very still while you -delicately- move a prove inside his/her hear and wait for the second set of beeps, that can be nearly impossible while your baby is squirming around. Short of putting the baby's head on a bench grip I don't know see how this thing can be practical."
1,Horrible Product,1 second ear thermometer my butt....this thing is the biggest waste of money ever i wouldn't suggest it to anyone!!!
1,Doesn't measure temperature properly,Quick reviewGot this as a gift and tired it on three members of the family. Each time it registered 96.7. Tried then on my daughter and it registered 98.6. At that time she was running a high fever. We then used a standard mouth registered thermometer. The reading was 101.8. Obviously this thing does not work as other have stated. Not sure what to do at this point. May send back for warranty work. Not sure it is worth my time. Do not buy this model.
1,Temperature keep on drifting,I bought this from Amazon and I don't like it - the masured temperature drifts from 96.8F to 99.6F in 6 minutes. So inaccurate.
2,I am still not sure about this product,This gives so many different readings in a short time I cannot recommend it. The beeping to make sure it is in the ear and ready is great other than that. I wouldn't ever recommend it again.
1,The worst product I ever bought from Amazon,Omron MC 514 Ear Thermometer with Advanced Temperature ScanningThis product rarely works. It averages one success for every 10 tries. Stay away from this. It has a cheap price and it isn't even worth that.
1,Advanced temperature scanning? Yeah right..,I think you could get a more accurate temperature by licking your finger and sticking it in someone's ear. This thing is a joke. I'm reasonably sure my body temperature wasn't 95 degrees.
2,Expensive junk,"About ten years ago, I needed a new watch, and I received this one as a gift for a personal milestone. It was returned to the jeweler twice while still under its three-year warranty, and once again afterwards.We were told that the watch model had been recalled for a short circuit. The only problem was, each time it was repaired, the manufacturer failed to fix it. The watch goes through cadmium batteries like water.The watch is beautiful, and I love it. It's mounted to a lovely hand made sterling silver Navajo watch band purchased in Canyon de Chelly.Alas, it doesn't run, and there's not much point in having it repaired again. The repairs last about as long as the batteries--not very."
4,Keeps you hanging!,This book was good but make sure you have read the previous serious about the Baxters! Also this doesn't tell anybodies whole story so you are left waiting for the next one to come out. I enjoyed it though and am anxiously looking forward to the next book in the Firstborn series!
5,fame,"Any of Karen Kingsbury's book will rate a 5 star! All her books are moving they will have you reflect on things in your life, cry, shout with joy and praising God for who he is."
5,"Another winner for Karen Kingsbury-catlady-Tucker, GA","Karen Kingsbury is truly an allstar in Christian fiction Series.FAME, the first in the FIRSTBORN series is a great way of continuing the Baxter Family story from the REDEMPTION Series.Dayne Matthews is truly a character that once you start reading FAME, you will be cheering him on to find the right diretion for his life.FAME is a ""you do not want to put the book down, till I am done""read. I did not want to put it down!I can not wait for the next book in the series."
5,True Love Affair,"Hamburger America is a true foodie's love affair. I first encountered the film in Santa Fe, NM so I was able to eat at the inimitable ""Bobcat Bite"" whose green chile (they spell it with a ""e"" out there) burgers are as phenomenal as the decor of the place is simple. You won't strictly need the sides due to the size of the burger, but the cole slaw is fabulous.Now that I live in Connecticut, I am soon due a pilgrimage to Louis's Lunch in New Haven and a side trip to try the steamed hamburgers in Meriden. There is nothing like a fine hamburger -- nothing! ""Hamburger America"" is a wonderful paean to the best burgers out there; there are so many others that deserve to be included, so do give us a sequel."
4,Does more than just Ameican Woman - versatile !,"Does A.W. perfectly; however, not many users seem to want to read the manual and/or try out different settings. There are MANY sounds to this pedal, it just takes time to tweak them out. Also, open the bottom of the casing and right in the middle of the board is a whole with a little, white part. Take a very small, flathead screwdriver and turn the part clockwise as far as you can. TADA ! Now any issues with the GATE feature are gone. This will make the GAIN knob much more sensitive but personally once I set that I really never mess with the gain again anyway.And after that 5 minute mod you'll be able to sustain notes for longer than you can stare at Keeley Hazell. Well, close.I give this 4.5 stars and it definitely worth the price. And yes, the color is Ms Liberty herself. Won't ever get it confused on a pedal board, that's for sure. I commend Tech 21 for standing out above the rest of ""me too"" products."
4,MUST READ!!!!,Great Book. Broken down in a way that allows the reader to disect the book and take notes like you were in school. Very thorough and indepth book. Organized wonderfully!!! A MUST READ FOR ANYONE WANTING A CAREER OF ANY KIND IN THE MUSIC BUSINESS!!!RGEAT BOOK!!!!!!
2,"An outdated, brief synopsis","I bought this book because of how affordable it was used, it might have been relevant when it was published however now all of the information published, especially with regard to social media is outdated and/or easily found for free in music marketing blogs. I hoped at least the music industry information would be helpful, but it's only a brief synopsis. For example, it talks about press releases without providing any in depth examples or instructions on writing one. That's just one example however. If you know nothing about the music industry I guess it might be helpful, but most of this information is already available for free on the internet."
3,Marketing Book Review,This book is not for the amateur in the music business. It is written in a technical style and is informative. I recommend it for agents who handle bigger acts.
2,No revelations here,"I expected to see more than just the gross movements of the katas. I had hoped from the summary provided on this site that some bunkai would be illustrated. The tape shows each kata done from 2 angles and at varied speeds. You can see angle, direction and stances, but there is no discussion about technique, body mechanics or anything else for that matter. I expected more."
2,shorin ryu kata dvd,"I do not know if I like this dvd yet or not; because I have NOT yet received it. It takes your company over 2 weeks to deliver. I have placed similar orders to OTHER companies who sale such items, and received them within 2 BUSINESS days. I do NOT plan to purchase from you again, if I can the items I want someplace else. I am very surprized you people are still in business after all these years."
