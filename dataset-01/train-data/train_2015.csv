3,Frequent errors mar a fair book.,"Frequent typographical errors particularly concerning dates tend to detract from this book. The coverage of the present day Grand Prix circuits is good, with much of the focus on the track history and memorable races. Some good photographs of Grand Prix past."
3,Why are they always overdone?,"The characters, the time period, the places, all interesting, but here and there in the dialogue, as so maddeningly happens with Southern literature and literature about the mountains (those colorful slandered Appalachians), there's just that extra lingo thrown in that throws things off. In this case, it was the repeated use of ""I got ME (fill in the blank, a man, a dress, a diploma, a problem with grammar)."" I agree that people say that, although rarely. In this book, they say it all the time. And it really seemed way overdone considering the other language of the characters and their other traits. I can't figure out why what would otherwise be good writing is intentionally overfilled with these overdone linguistic reminders that the characters are ""different."" It's not only contrived seeming, it's distracting and annoying. Let's have characters talk the way people really talk."
3,Enjoyable,Crazy Ladies turned out to be better than expected. Women of all ages can relate to this novel.
4,"A Quick, Enjoyable Read","I found this book difficult to put down. It is filled with gritty stories of the pain of women who are too crazy (many diagnosably so) to endure it gracefully. Those who come from more priviledged backgrounds will feel challenged to empathize with these women and their lack of resources, both emotional and financial. Women who have experienced hardships will be pleased to find that they are not alone.For those who are looking for a book in the spirit of ""Ya-Ya's,"" this may be a disappointment. The few times I laughed were near the end. Queenie was the most likable and humorous character. I would be interested in reading a book written entirely from her point of view in the future!"
5,Dynamite Read!!!,"Just finished this book after reading the two YaYa books back to back. It was a page turner & always kept my interest. It's a book that is difficult to put down. Plot line was simple & direct without all the frou-frou of Ya-Ya books. Author did a great job with historical chronology. As a 50-something--I kept thinking, I've been there, I've done that!I agree that the title should be changed as well as the book jacket cover. Jacket cover photo has nothing to do with the story."
2,No light at the end of the tunnel for characters,"I had a hard time deciding who to like in this story. I thought the characters were unbelievably cruel to Dorothy. Who doesn't invite their daughter/sister to Thankgiving knowing that she had no other place to go and she lives next door. I kept waiting for one of the characters to stand up for Dorothy. The discovery of the skeleton was anti-climatic, and nothing was resolved at the end of the book."
3,"Easy to read, gripping, but not great.","This book was well written and it grabbed me right from the beginning, but there was something missing. I couldn't really like most of the characters or care about what happened to them. I just wanted to know what happened next, if anyone grew or changed in any way, but no one did. That made for sort of an empty book."
1,"Awful, Awful, Awful!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","This book was awful. I bought this book because it was being compared to Divine Secrets. This book doesn't even come close. I found none of characters likeable. In fact, they irritated me. Crazy Ladies does not even deserve one star."
3,They're no Ya-Yas,"I saw an ad for this book in the New Yorker this spring, touting it as the precursor to the Ya Ya Sisterhood novel. It started out that way, but fizzled into nothing at the end. One of the most colorful characters was not addressed at all in the final chapter; we were left wondering what happened to her, when everything else was tied up into a neat little package. And the storyline of the dead body in the back yard failed to materialize into anything interesting at the end of the book.But those complaints aside, the characters are very vivid, and I catch myself thinking about them from time to time. I especially liked one of the grandaughters of the matriarch, the girl who survived her drunk, hippie mother. That struck a cord with me.All in all it's a good read full of wonderful characters, but the end is a bit of a disappointment."
3,Not heartwarming enough for me,"I found this book an easy and entertaining read, but unfortunately, I did not find it heartwarming enough. It did not manage to make me laugh either. I felt really sad when Dorothy strayed into the wrong path, none of her family really assisted to set her right. I could not really connect to the characters and did not really like them enough to care what happen to them in the end."
5,"Michael Lee, Please write more books!","My sister turned me on to Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood and now I'm letting her read my Michael Lee West books....I've read 2 and the third is on the way! They are readable and fun and sad to finish. Please Michael Lee, write some more books!"
3,Corny Tear-jerker,"This book was written like a corny summer movie tear-jerker. The plot was predictable, the descriptions and dialogue were often very clunky and simplistic. I really didn't love any of the characters. I felt like I was reading a rough draft for someone's first novel. It was okay, but alot of the writing really needed to be reworked--there were nuggets of really good passages amongst the fields of corn. I have a feeling that Ms. West developed her voice in her subsequent novels so I WILL give her another chance."
4,enjoyable read,"I really liked this book. Although I wouldn't go so far as to compare this book to the Ya-Ya's, it was a fabulous tale. The main setting was a small town in TN. The main characters were three generations of women from one family. The matriarch, Gussie and her daughters, Dorothy and Clancy Jane, and their daughters, Bitsy and Violet. In addition, we are treated to viewpoints from Gussie's maid Queenie, who has been with her since Dorothy was a small child. I won't go as far as some reviewers have and spoil the plot for you, but I will encourage anyone who likes Southern fiction to read this book. Ms. West shows the trials of this family, how secrets and miscommunication can affect our lives, and how our choices change our lives. This book spans the time period from 1932 until the early 1970's. You will be touched by these women and the problems they create for themselves and how they solve them."
4,A bit of Southern Comfort delight,"Oooh, Michael Lee West really knows how to write wonderful and wacky Southern characters. This is not a deep or revelatory book, not terribly meaningful in any literary way - it's just a great story with some delightfully memorable, and yes, Crazy Ladies. Three generations are spanned, headed by matriarch Gussie. Though some memorably dreadful events are chronicled, the overall tone is hilarity - and, in the end, love.May Michael Lee Smith write on and on."
4,Good story,"I enjoyed ""Crazy Ladies"". It was written in a style I like. Different characters get a chance to narrate so you are able to get other points of view on certain events.Also I like novels that extend through the years. You get to see how characters grow up and what happens to them later on in life.The hippie stuff and anti-Vietnam was a little overdone, but other than that, I really liked this book."
4,"Fun ,but should have another title.","The title led me to believe there would be more antics and female bonding a la ""Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood"". The ladies in this book are all related and much revolves around the changes in their relationships. Different chapters from different character viewpoints are appealing, but be prepared for a lot of pain and bad choices made by otherwise smart women."
5,She did it again!,"I bought this book because I was so impressed with Ms. West's "" She Flew the Coop"". Crazy ladies was heart-warming and funny. I am sold on Ms. West as an author."
1,it drove ME crazy,"This book was a disappointment to me from the beginning. The southern drawl was overdone, the characters lacked depth and what's worse, none of them were the least bit likable, save Violet. And Violet got, what, 2 chapters? I couldn't sympathize with them and most of the time I was annoyed by them, especially Dorothy, what a character! The only resemblence to the YaYas is that it's about southern women and it's in about the same time era. Although the YaYas were sad at times, their story was about finding love, even if only through a friend. This story was all about the lack of love, and how depressing it can be."
1,Depressing plot and self-conscience writing,"I did not enjoy this book. I kept reading in hopes that it would get better. It didn't. The characters are not likable and the different voices they are written in don't ring true, instead they get in the way. The characters do not grow or learn from their mistakes and I stopped caring about all of them pretty early. Altogether a disappointing experience."
3,Average tale of a family's women,"The hoopla surrounding this book has me stumped. Granted, the first chapter is excellent. After that, however, the book plods along with all the expected highlights of a multi-decade book. It is readable and somewhat interesting, but so predictable. There are few surprises, no unexpected plot developments after the first chapter. This is a fun read, but not a great book. Take it to the pool."
2,Doesn't Compare to the Ya-Ya's,"I fell in love with the characters from ""The Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood"". I've re-read that book a hundred times just because the characters are so full of life that you actually feel like you're there with them. But in Crazy Ladies I was forcing myself to finish it. It started off good and caught me immediatly but after the first 4 chapters it only goes on and on about the same problems. Dorothy can't get over her need to be the best and ""mother dears sweetheart"". Clancy goes round a round with needing to be free and not couped up. After a while it just got boring and the plot seemed to repeat itself. I would say if you're going to read this book, read it before you read about the Ya-Ya's by Rebecca Wells. You'll see the difference!"
1,caught in a month of talk shows,"This story grabs you on page 3 and lets you go after chapter 4. I feel like I have been reading about a month's worth of talk show topics: Murder, teenage pregnancy, cancer, alcoholism, affairs, divorce, abusive husbands, depression, attempted suicides, living in poverty, runaways, eloping, burying someone alive, paranoid schizophrenia, dramatic childbirths, drugs, rape, hippies, war, protests, amputations, not paying child support, jealousy, prejudice, violence, etc. I read this because of the comparisons to the Ya Ya's. There was no humor. It was depressing. The characters were not developed. I couldn't wait to finish the book. I was even more disappointed with the way the book ended. The main characters in the end were not the main characters. Bizarre book."
4,Strong women,"A shocking incident in the early days of her marriage in the 1930's, forces Miss Gussie along a certain path in life, where she does what she has to in order to protect herself and her family. The story then follows the lives of her daughters and two more generations after that. We meet the plain ones, the pretty ones, the jealous and the open hearted in a story which connects the generations in a very real way which I enjoyed enormously and would thoroughly recommend to anyone looking for a light, entertaining read about women with strong character, for better or worse. This is M/s West's first novel so I look forward to finding more recent ones."
4,Great read....,"I really liked this book. I'm a big fan of books with multiple narrators (Saving Graces, Future Homemakers of America, ect.) This one was just as good.It's pretty much the story of 2 sisters, one who can do no wrong (Clancy Jane), and one who can do no right (Dorothy), their mother, and their daughters. I have to admit, sometimes I felt sorry for Dorothy (though other times I wanted to kill her), and it really wasn't right that no matter how many times Clancy screwed over her loved ones, they always welcomed her back with open arms.My favortie though was Violet...good for her!! She didn't come from the most stable of environments, but she was the most normal person in the book.Overall, a great read...for women. You become so engrossed in these womens lives, that you can't put it down."
2,This was not a very good book. I was very disappointed.,I read this book because I had recently read The Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood. Reviews at Amazon.com suggested that Crazy Ladies was even better than the Ya-Ya book. This was not so. This book was mediocre at best and a big waste of time. The book is one catoastrophe after another. I didn't like any of the characters one iota. I do not recommend this book to anyone.
4,Ladies Rule even Crazy Ladies,"This family had many problems and tragedies in their lives. Reading about all of the bad things that happen to the people they loved, I saw how each character would deal with tragedies in their own way. Sometimes to their own detriment and others dealing without going crazy. Miss Gussie and Queenie held the family together. Miss Gussie's children and the children's children would come to Miss Gussie and Queenie for comfort and in times of need. Both Miss Gussie and her long time maid Queenis always opened up the house with open arms. This book was very enjoyable...it was funny, sad and you would always route for them."
5,Perfect ending to the series!,"This book reads like an old friend! You already know the rest of the family, now find out what happens with Marcail! Similar story line to Sean Donovan, but unique in it's own right. A pleasure to read!"
3,Not her best work,"This final book in the Californians was rather disappointing. It was still a fairly good book, but was not close to the standard set by the previous three."
5,I loved it!!!!!!,All the books in the series were fantastic but this one was the best. I stayed up until 6:30 a.m since the day before simply because i could not put the book down. it was a great ending to the series!!!!
3,"Disappointed in delivery, delighted about what I got","Received DVD in an ample amount of time but was disappointed when I received the 2nd of a 2 disc set. Per the product description I was suppose to get a 7 part HBO series, instead I got 5-7 parts...no 1-6 parts at all. Again, I was disappointed because I did not see the Youth Speak group from my immediate area perform. They would have been in the 1-6 episodes. Guess I can't complain too much considering how much I paid for the DVD...I just will not use this business in the future because I was given misleading information."
4,VERY INTERESTING,"I LOVE SPOKEN WORD! This was wonderful being that it was a video of our youth reading and writing mindblowing poetry. I loved it! The only problem I had was that this should have been a three disk set instead of two. Reason being is that one of the disk should have been the commentary disk where they could explain all that they had to explain and to detail the lives of the youth and what motivated them to write such poems, and the two other disk should have shown more of them reciting the poems that they were performing. The way it was done, was commentary throughout the whole movie. It was very annoying to try and concentrate on the poetry they were perfoming then being cut short to listen to the commentary."
4,Saw the tv show,I saw this on HBO and I got a few of the extras off itunes. This was a great show. glad to see the youth so passionate about something and their issues. I remember when I was in high school writing I had no idea a brave new voices existed i don;t even think anyone in my school did either. This set of shows were just awesome and to see these kids in my own city bringing it makes me proud. I wish we saw more inspirational other than just what the news shows.
4,Not what I expected,"Excellent performances but unfortunately I didn't get the disks I wanted. I only received Episodes 1-4. Despite this I enjoyed what I saw immensely. These are some powerful poets, but like some people beneath me, I too was misled.~Nylus"
1,"Why, What Was He Thinking??","I read Gone But Not Forgotten when it first came out and while I don't remember too much about it, one thing that sticks in my mind was its mindblowing (though implausible) ending. Since then, I've occassionally read his others, which have been okay, but just that. Wild Justice, however, is awful. I won't bore you with a blow by blow recitation of the facts, because they've been recited by other reviewers and, more importantly, they don't merit any serious mention as that might lend some credence to this disaster of a story. Suffice it to say that Wild Justice is predictable from a mile away. The story is pointless and to say the characters are one dimensional is a compliment.Stick with Gone But Not Forgotten. If you want to read a really good thriller, read The Big Picture or The Job by Douglas Kennedy, the Hit Man by Lawrence Block, or A King's Ransom by Grippando."
1,Insulting,This book is simple to the point of being insulting to the reader. The reader will know the killer immediately and what's worse he won't really care. Phillip Margolin should offer readers a refund for the time and money they spend on this book.
1,Overrated,"This has to be one of the most poorly written books I have ever read. The unbelievable plot borders on silliness, with cardboard characters, and a ridiculous romance thrown in. The protagonist Amanda Jaffe has to be one of the stupidest characters in recent years. This book is written to move at a fast pace, and as a result some detail that may have saved this book from being what it is was not included. One reviewer compared this book to Thomas Harris' Red Dragon. I can't imagine a greater insult to Thomas Harris' masterpiece. Save yourself some money and skip this one."
3,"Pulp fiction - nothing more, nothing less","The story moves along at a fairly quick pace because of all the dialog, not because of all the action. The main character, Amanda Jaffe, is written so thinly that I could barely remember her name long enough to write this review. As with all pulp fiction, we're given a red herring to chase around, and I must admit Margolin, the author, did a good job with this character. He's well developed and easy to hate. Unfortunately, since he's thrown right in front of us, we can automatically discount him as a suspect. The coup de grace happens midway through the book when Amanda unwittingly has sex (in graphic detail) with the real ""evil-doer"".If you're looking for a quick read with gruesome acts of violence, this is your book. If you're looking for something substantial, with well written characters and page-turning suspence, I'd look elsewhere."
2,For The Real Blood And Gore Reader,"My biggest problem with this book is its lack of artifice; I figured out who the killer was almost from the start. This villian is a fiend who tortures, mutilates, and kills for fun and profit. Personally this is not ""Thrilling"" to me; it's sick and it is a substitute for plot, character development, and ambience. Author Margolin is about as subtle as a mace and chain. My regret is that I finished it."
4,Somewhat predictable,"Go action throughout the book, kept you wanting to keep reading. Only issue it was somewhat predictable after reading 25%"
4,Be Prepared To Clear Your Schedule Once You Start This Book!,"Margolin's latest, Wild Justice, is VERY fast-paced, exciting and suspenseful. Without giving away the plot, I know you'll feel that once you start reading this book it will seem that the pages are just flying past your eyes. If you like thrillers, you won't find many recent books in this genre that will stack up to Wild Justice. The only reason that I didn't give Wild Justice a ""5 star"" rating is that despite Margolin's many and interesting efforts to keep you guessing as to who the murderer is, I was able to determine the killer too early on in the story. Even if this turns out to be your experience as well, I think you'll still feel that Wild Justice is a book that will keep you on the edge of your seat and is one that you'll want to recommend to others. Enjoy!"
5,PHILLIP MARGOLIN RULES. . .,"Mr. Margolin does it again. A thriller so chilling that I wanted to read with my eyes closed!!! What makes the book even more terrifying is the fact that the characters are real, and Mr. Margolin has done his homework and knows his material so well. Be prepared! Once you start reading, you won't be able to stop. Thanks Mr. M. for another good time."
3,"Not ""Gone But Not Forgotten"" or even ""After Dark""","Phillip Margolin used to be one of those very few authors whose latest book I would buy sight unseen. I knew I would enjoy it. Hmm, now I guess, I'll have to wait for customer reviews of his next before I get a copy for myself. If I had, I wouldn't have purchased this one. This book definitely does not have the ""page-turnability"" of his past efforts. The biggest dissapointment comes from the plotting. Veteren thriller readers, and I suspect some who are not quite veterens, will figure out ""whodunit"" as soon as that character is introduced. It is very obvious. Also the characters are flat, not as well developed as in previous books."
1,Butchery,"I have read several Phillip Margolin books and liked them.But this one is too much.Stolen body parts. A self-amputated hand. A re-attached OTHER hand. Not one, not two, but many basement butcher shops--for butchering people.Plastic surgery to evade the mob. Not one but two people planting serial-killer clues to frame others.People getting shot and dying instantly. People getting shot and not dying at all.Mob enforcers dressed as doctors. Someone stabbed through the ear with a bed-spring.YES!All this and more in one book, to ruin your lunch.Margolin is a master of the twist and double-twist, the unexpected swerve at the end.But in this book, I foresaw the real killer 50 pages in, and found the zigs and zags tiresome.Two stars off for one or more serial killers. Tired, tired plot device.One star off for telegraphing his punches.One star off for too damn much blood and gore. Revolting. Laughable.On the plus side, Amanda and her father are quite likable."
2,Just not very good.,"A co-worker of mine read this after it had been recommended by a friend. But she was disappointed when she finished it. I should have listened to her and skipped it, but I didn't have anything else to read at the time, so I gave it a shot.The plot is fast-paced, and exciting, but there really isn't much more to it, besides a lot of bodies, blood and gore. The characters are completely unrealistic and shallow, and the ""twist"" at the end is easy to see coming. I had it figured out around page 125 somewhere.If you like a page-turner with lots of violence, you may enjoy this book. Otherwise, it's not worth the time."
3,surgical gore,"short chaptered,breathless pacing for an unfortunately proven bestseller theme:the extremes of human depravity.in this case, serial dismemberment for torture research and black market organ transplants.psychopaths are all too prevalent and convenient in popular fiction.a vapid thriller."
1,Obvious,".... No mystery! Obvious who the bad guy is early on. Fortunately, it's a very quick read (big type, wide margins)."
4,good book,"i enjoyed this book.i wasnt surewho the kller was until the end of the book.i didnt put the book down and read t in one sitting.definately worth a read.characters were interesting,"
2,too easy to figure out,"Well written, and I finished the book just to see how the author managed the twists and turns, but... I knew _very_ early on exactly how this was going to play out and the real villain (serial killer) was apparent almost immediately when the character was introduced.This plot line is not at all original, and so was not nearly as enjoyable as it might have been had I not realized less than a 1/4 of the way through who the real killer was.It's not that I'm so smart; the story is just too transparent."
3,A bit too easy to figure...some good moments though,"This was my first Margolin book and it was a decent read. I really liked Amanda and Frank Jaffe. They are sympathic leads. However, book tries to be a serious and complex mystery, but I figured it out well before the end. In fact, some of my questions about the murderer were not answers. I don't want to ruin the book and put my questions here, but I still don't quite understand the frame-ups. Why? The dialogue here is a bit too wooden and the plot too bizarre."
4,A wild ride,"Having read and enjoyed Margolin's book, The Associate, I was back in search of more from the author. Next on the list was Wild Justice. I was not disappointed. It starts fast and moves forward at a quick pace throughout. Wild Justice is filled with action, suspense, plot twists and good character development. The story is set in the Pacific Northwest as a father-daughter legal team represents two defendants accused of a string of brutal serial killings. (Despite the compelling nature of the story, the intensity of the subject matter and detailed descriptions in regards to the serial murders mean that this work is not for the faint of heart.) My only real complaint with the book was that I was able to deduce the identity of the perpetrator too early in the book. Although my early guess ultimately was proven to be correct, the work was still very entertaining as Margolin brought everything together for a great closing to the book."
3,WILD JUSTICE ONLY FAIR!!!!!,"I have read several Margolin books and I think I have rated about all of them a three. I don't know why I keep on trying when I read others that I rate higher. I nearly lost this one during the first twenty or so pages, I kept getting so many people thrown at me I was confused as to who was who. I think most can figure out who the real killer is way before the book is over, I know it is easy to figure out who it is not. Amanda Jaffe may be a good lawyer but she needs some help in the common sense department. I felt sorry for Bobby Vasquez, he really wanted to catch the true killer and tried his best. Our laws today, in many cases, help the killer more than the police who are trying to do their job. The making of a new hand was a joke, can't buy that one. I ask my question again, why do I buy these???"
3,"Wild, But Not Too Wild","Four years after a surgeon escapes punishment for a series of grisly murders, his estranged wife is arrested for a copycat crime. A standard formula thriller ensues, as Margolin pulls out all the stops, creating an entertaining tale that I couldn't help but think could have been better with a little tweaking."
4,"Not quite ""Silence of the Lambs"" but better than ""Hannibal""","If you're a fan of a more sophisticated thriller, look elsewhere. If you like a quick and scary read that will keep you turning the pages until you absolutely HAVE to put the book down, this is the story for you. In Philip Margolin's newest novel, we have a typical smart/young/maybe a bit naive heroine along with some sketchy characters - several of which could possibly be the killer! The setting is the Portland, Oregon area, same as in his last best-seller ""Gone But Not Forgotten"" and we see our lead and other characters in courtroom, hospital and social settings. Short chapters kept me going but would have appreciated a bit more character development. All in all, I rate this a better-than-average novel."
3,"Entertaining, but nothing special or unique.","This is a perfectly adequate thriller, guaranteed to be a one-night read, with it's short chapters and many plot twists and turns. If that's what you're looking for (and I was when I read it) I recommend this one. However, if you're looking for a thriller that breaks new ground by introducing unique characters, you won't find it here. There is the obligatory beautiful/smart/reckless/young heroine and several evil/smart/ruthless/possible-sociopathic-serial-killers, and several points in the book when ALL the clues point to a new and different possible-sociopathic-serial-killer, but there is nothing to set this this thriller apart. It seems as if the characters have been created from a formula that too many writers in this genre have used."
4,"Wild Ride in ""Wild Justice""","Phillip Margolin's ""Wild Justice"" exemplifies the writer's love of twist and circumstance. Margolin holds no punches in this fast paced story of murder and deciet, and that's just the beginning! Addictive plots that carry more twists than a rollercoaster at full speed, Margolin test the flaws of human judgement and its eventual consequences. A master storyteller with an brazen side for the macabre, Margolin scores a hit with this insatiable ride in ""Wild Justice"". Amanda Jaffe, Vincent Cardoni, and Bobby Vasques play viable characters in this off-beat suspense of trust and betrayal. Good to the last sentence. This one's a keeper!"
1,yuck,"this book is only for people who like nonstop blood and gore. character after character is brutally murdered, and that was only in the first 30 or so pages. it's kind of like reading a steven seagall movie. if that appeals to you, this book is for you."
3,Too artificial and predictable to be really satisfying,"Maybe my judgement of this book was affected by my growing lack of patience for books about doctors and lawyers, but I felt that it was much more artificial in plot and character than I would have expected from Phillip Margolin. Almost from the first page one senses a kind of stiffness in the dialogue and shallowness in the presentation of character that might more reasonably be expected from an inexperienced writer. And what really kills any enjoyment a reader may have in the story is the absolute predictablility of the outcome. The author's deliberate misdirection in trying to set up a villain straw man so that readers don't realize who the murderer really is, is painfully obvious, and doesn't work. Neither does the book."
2,The Fourth Hand,"Slow moving, funny at times but mostly it just never seems to get started. John Irving has done much better than this."
3,"OK, but easy to figure out","As I read in a review one time, ""if you are a mystery fan and you can't figure out whodunit you need a new hobby"". Overalll the book was just OK, nothing new or exiting. I didn't even think it was all that ""gross"" or anything.One of the book jacket comments compared Wild Justice to Harris' ""Red Dragon"", this book is not nearly in that class."
2,Not his best,"I usually enjoy this author very much, but this book fell very flat.I picked up on who the killer was right away, and to me, it was so obvious that I thought I had to be wrong...sad to say, I wasn't.Don't lose sleep if you skip this one."
5,AQ @ Work,"""I have been reading AQ over and over again and find every concept most practical and applicable in life, work and relationships.""""This book has global appeal and lays the foundation for the future and an optimized life. It is the blueprint of the human journey to a life well-lived and the world well-occupied by climbers."""
2,buy a different translation,"For the sake of brevity, I will say merely that this translation was entirely successful in its aim to vulgarize Nietzsche's stylistic idiosyncracies for the sake of mass consumption. This is a beautiful book, and deserves a more sympathetic treatment. R.J. Hollingdale's translation is the best, but even Walter Kaufmann's is preferable to this one. It DOES matter!"
4,Finally a comfortable set of headphones,"I was so tired of my ears beginning to hurt after only 5 minutes of listening to my CD player or using my gameboy, that I decided to try something new. These blue stereophones are not only comfortable but they're also easily adjustable to fit anyone. Another benefit of these is the volume control attached to the cord, all you do is scroll the bar up or down to immediately change the sound imput. They're quite possibly the best stereophones I've purchased...and at such a great price!"
5,"""Great adventure book""",A great book that you wont be able to put down. It is very well written and it makes you feel as if your sharing in this great adventure. To the Simons if you read this: Thanks for a great read.
2,bogus adventure,"The author fills a boat to the gills with store - bought food and fuel and then freezes himself into the arctic ice for the winter because he thinks this ""genuine"" (my quotes) experience will put him in touch with the Inuit culture. It's difficult to admire or root for this guy because so much of what he does seems foolish and self indulgent, rather than daring. Somewhat painful to read."
4,Great True Adventure!,Anyone who sails and likes adventure will like this book. I Love True Adventure Stories and have sailed a few times. Learned a lot about the Inuits way of life. They are amazing people.
3,A Selfish Man,"I was struck again and again by the stupidity of this man's actions. He seemed to have a death wish and narrowly escaped with his life. No big deal if he made this trip alone, but he didn't. Time and time again, he put his wife's live in jeopardy to fulfill his own juvenile ambitions. A compelling book, yes, but rarely have I seen such a selfish, arrogant individual who nonetheless holds himself up as a good liberal with deep insights into the human psyche. Please! Simon struck me as someone with the common sense of 15-year old boy drunk on whiskey with his parent's car keys."
3,"Well-written, but a bit too long?","This is a very readable book for inlanders like me, from north Texas, and fascinated by the sea. The descriptions of the waxing and waning of the ice in the far north is especially well-done. My only complaint is that it became a bit much after about page 250. There was a fair amount of repetition which a good editor could have pared off. And once or twice, the author becomes a little too self-righteous in his judgments of others. One who so willingly disregards the preference (and even safety) of his wife should judge others cautiously! Still, very readable, very interesting, and I would recommend it to anyone for a good summer read."
5,"Fulfilling a dream, Testing limits, and Commitment","It is a beautifully written, gutsy, saga of Alva and Diana Simon and their cat Halifax, who sail to the Artic Circle and spend the winter. Diana is forced to leave and Alva must spend months alone in his steel coffin of a ship that is buried in the snow and ice.It was a very moving adventure. Both are tested to the limits of their endurance.The people and animals they met were joy to read about.They share the beauty of their relationship with a picnic on an ice cap at sundown.Thank you Alva and Diana for sharing the adventure."
3,Dense but worthy....,"I took my time reading this arctic journey. It is a well-written saga - factual and spritual. I was a little taken back with the bear account towards the end and I have trouble believing its authenticity. Simon's machismo was also a tiring at times. Nevertheless, my hats off to this adventurous couple and their ability to reach their goals!"
2,Disappointing,"I was initially excited about this book, and it did have some good features. Like its pictures and descriptions of northern Canada, which I found very compelling. But the premise is dumb (why does he _need_ to go freeze himself into the ice?), and Simon's philosophical babblings get really tiresome by the end. I ended up feeling really sorry for his wife who has to put up with him. I also shared a chuckle with the Inuit, who conned him into going up and mooning a polar bear!"
2,Ego lost in the vastness of wilderness nary deserves pity,"All these years Paul Theroux has reigned supreme as curmudgeon of adventure/travel tales, until now. Simon challenges Theroux as the most arrogant, self-centered, chauvantistic, stump-headed fool to be in a cool spot and have a good story to tell."
3,North to The Night,This book is well written and interesting in strange way. As I read through the story I kept asking myself why would any sane person put themselves through this kind of experience.After finishing the book I still don't have an answer to that question. Possibly the answer is to write a book about it.Don't read this at night in bed in the Fall you will be cold for the rest of the night!
1,"All New Zealand Sign Language, not ASL","Why this book was reprinted in the U.S. (after it's initial publication in New Zealand) is beyond me. This book contains all New Zealand Sign Language, not American Sign Language (ASL). Contrary to what many people think, sign language among the deaf population is not universal. Countries all have their own version of sign language and ASL is used only in the U.S. and Canada. This book was written by a New Zealand author who offers classes in her country. The highly disappointing and surprising twist is that it was published by Perigee, an American publishing house devoted to publications dealing with deafness and American Sign Language, so it's not like they didn't realize the book was not ASL! Very strange! A better choice...""Baby Sign Language Basics"" or Sign, Sing and Play"" both by Monta Z. Briant."
1,Nightmare,"My intro to assembly and comp. architecture class used this text and it was physically painful to use.Class is easy enough, no problem understanding; this book however hamstrings you at every turn.Generally a ill composed collection of pages that should be ashamed to be opened in the halls of any self respecting university. I will most assuredly be tossing this book into my compost heap, that it may never poison another student's life."
1,Frustrating Errors,"Having taken the class at UW-Madison for which this book was written, and my instructor being Karen Miller (one of the authors), even she admitted to the great number of errors. It is highly frustrating to open the book read something, and then wonder, ""Gee, is this correct?"" Constantly referring to Karen's list of webpage errors was frustrating. Chapter 9 was completely re-written and made available to us in PDF format because the book's version was poor.I'm shocked that the university is still using the text. Though it was only slightly easier to follow the material since the author was also my instructor, she also seemed annoyed that through some departmental/political/publishing snafu that they are still using the text 10yrs later.Avoid this book if you have a choice."
1,new edition has not been printed,"Based on the author's review I tried to get a copy of a newer edition than 1993. According to Oxford Press, the newer edition is in press but has not been printed and they have no publication date available."
2,tastes o.k. not real chocolaty- I like the latte one better,The chocolate flavour one does not taste as good as the caramel latte. It is more gritty tasting too! But I love the nutrition it gives!
4,French Menu Translator,"I purchased this for an upcoming visit to France and think it will be very useful, esp. for someone who has limited French and loves food. I tested it out using menu information from my French Michelin guide. It does not list everything, but it contains a lot of terms and descriptions."
1,Very poorly written,"I used this book for a graduate-level engineering course. This book is one of the worst textbooks I have seen.Is is evident that several people wrote this textbook because the style of writing will change between sections from informal to formal. Some of the sections are better written than others. In the poorly written sections, it can be very hard to follow what they are trying to say. Overall, the writing is very disjointed and care should have been taken to properly introduce topics and create more of a flow to the text.Also, there are numerous spelling errors and incomplete sentences in the text. For a third edition, one would expect those errors to be corrected; they are very obvious.The examples also contain errors. Again, the errors are very obvious such as 11-2=7.I would not recommend this textbook. At first glance, it appears to be a very comprehensive book but, actually it is very poorly written and does not explain the material well."
1,Worst Book Ever!,"This textbook is horrible. I am an engineering student and this is the most confusing book I have ever seen. Charts are randomly placed in paragraphs, with no mention of them in the writing. Equations are quoted, also with no explanation. It's like someone ripped up a bunch of good textbooks and this happen to land in a pile. This should not be used in classes, or by anyone."
2,borrrrringggg,"This book is so hard to read, i fell asleep several time while studying. But in the end it got all the information"
1,Look for another book,"Book is full of ""Buzzword Bingo"" phrases. For example, velocity is defined as synthesis with speed.The authors seem to have an axe to grind with management about facilities planning. Perhaps the saying, ""Those who can't... teach!"" holds true. Sorry professors, the real life situation is that a facilities planner may have his/her plans squished like a little bug occasionally to meet an ROI or even a manager's ego, get over it or find a new line of work.Book is also full of little changes in terminology between pages and chapters for the same material that the reader can find confusing. A few errors here and there that are probably typical of any technical text and some dated photos but generally an acceptable introduction to facilities planning.Otherwise, the book is an extremely slow read with little information that you can't find elsewhere in a nice binding. It'll look good on a shelf."
1,Very Frustrating...,"This by far is the most horribly written textbook I have ever purchased/read. If it was not a course requirement for my major, I would've tossed it some time ago. There are excessive errors not only with grammar and spelling, but in the calculations of example problems as well. There are also excessive amounts of calculation errors in the solutions manual causing more confusion than it would help. I simply cannot believe this textbook was written by engineers, more so cannot believe that it was published and is on its third edition..."
4,Haas Lifts This Teen Melodrama,"Normally, I wouldn't go for a movie centered around two young teens but this is well-done and one of the actors, Lukas Haas, is a veteran despite his age. (He was the little Amish boy in ""Witness"").Haas is outstanding in here, particularly in conveying his feelings throughout the film. It's a story that could easily be trite or corny but winds up appealing with no unpleasant scenes overdone. That could have happened since the girl (Vanessa Zaoui) is a traumatized kid with several mental problems. Michael Gross and Amy Aquino, meanwhile, do a decent job of playing Jewish parents and it's nice to see a father portrayed in a positive light, for a change.In summary, a good and somewhat underrated melodrama"
5,All around great movie,"This is something of a coming of age movie, where a young boy learns the meaning of friendship and that life isn't always going to be fair. It is a story that will be familier to any of us who were young teenagers striving to have a degree of independence. It also gives a glimpse of New York during the latter stages of World War II - German submarines are no longer prowling off the coast sinking ships, but there is still the periodic air raid drill to remind you that the war is still on-going.The cast all around is outstanding. The father charecter of Lukas Haas is exceptional. Mom reminds me of my mother in some or her mannerisms.The movie leaves you wondering if there will be a better day for Naomi and Alan. It should be in every family movie library."
1,Not the genuine article!,"The only word to use here is disappointment and false advertising. This CD does not feature the original versions of the songs that many of us know and love but substandard, obviously rushed re-recordings featuring former Searcher Mike Pender and a new backing band.The renditions are uninspired with the only redeeming factor being that Mike Pender's voice is on display.It should be noted that this CD is in breech of an agreement between Mike Pender and the Searchers that requires that Mike Pender's group not be known as the Searchers but as ""Mike Pender's Searchers.The original Searchers, led by founder John McNally, are still active and touring the world."
5,UNREAL!,"THIS RECORD NOT ONLY FEATURES THE ORIGINAL LEAD SINGER MIKE PENDER, BUT HAS THEM DOING THE OLD HITS (JUST LIKE THEY WERE DONE BACK THEN ALONG WITH NEW STUFF THAT IS KNOCKED OUT! ) THIS CD SHOWS JUST HOW GOOD THOSES BRITISH GROUPS ERE BACK IN THE 60'S PRODUCED BY THE LEGENDARY PRODUCER DOC HOLIDAY, THIS CD IS A MUST FOR COLLECTORS"
4,A very vibrant book...,"I must say that I was more impressed by this book than I had initially expected... first off, the illustrations are very bright and captivating... and to me, the pictures are one of the most important thing in gaining a child's interest in a book... in addition to that though, the story is just terrific... this book teaches a big lesson in patience... one day everyone will get his/her chance to shine!!! This puts such a cute spin on the story of the Star of Bethlehem... I was very impressed with this book..."
3,Caution: Radio Show,"A caution to shoppers: this CD is a radio show in which Caroline Myss does 99.9% of the talking, and the radio host virtually none (not necessarily a bad thing if you like the radio format). Also, if you are a Myss reader/listener, much, if not all, of the material is available along with much more in-depth and enlightening information on Caroline's other book-on-CD or soft/hardcover book releases. If you've never read or heard Ms. Myss, it's a good starting point, though. If I were to do it over again, I'd pass on this release and stick with Myss' ""Advanced Energy Anatomy"" or ""Essential Guide For Healers"". It's simply a case of ""more bang for the buck"". As for the other reviews I've seen labeling Caroline Myss as arrogant: she just knows her stuff. She's also very humble when it's warranted."
1,You can't heal by spirit alone.,Entertaining in the sense that it passes time but not very useful in the prctical sense.
3,Great Pictures,"But the viewing screen is so small it's hard to see and easily scratched. Using the different modes and options isn't very user friendly and once your batteries die, you have to re-set the date stamp when replacing them. We've not dropped it in water, so can't speak to it's resistance, but seems very solid and size is convenient for travel."
2,Sturdy but the picture quality leaves much to be desired,"I got this camera for one reason - fishing pictures - and it is adequate for that or beach photos. If everything is evenly lit and you don't need to rely on the flash it's OK. And no problem if it gets wet or sandy. By the way, the imaging software that comes with it is bad beyond belief and makes all the pix look worse so don't bother installing it - use whatever you have. It is serviceable and sturdy and will probably never endear itself to me unless I become enamoured of taking pictures in the rain. However, I must say it has an excellent macro capability and if you're not catching any fish you can take nice flower closeups along the bank."
2,Fairly boring,Nothing at all stands out on this album. When I finish it I feel like I have wasted my time or I am asleep.
2,I had to buy it,"I was told to buy this model. It was used for finding rebar or steel columns in walls. I would not recommend. If you are looking for studs buy a good stud finder. If you want to pinpint stell, find something better. Maybe it work well for somebody, but it didn't seem very accurate or user friendly."
1,Failure to correctlly find steel mesh or rebar under the concreet,i attemted to locate steel or wire mesh under my concrete deck around the swimming pool deck. The Zircon unit gave false signals. I needed to ground a stainless steel ladder and a guiding stainless steel post that extended into the pool for three feet. I drilled several holes past the depth of the concrete(arriving at dirt); but still no metal.I sunk several 8 feet ground rods into the ground and connected the steps and the guiding post with number 8- copper wire.
2,Civil / Structure Engineer,"On Concrete foundation, the scanner always beep when the find any rock with iron - false reading. Any body guest where the rebar is. However, on CMU (Concrete Masonry Unit) it works a bit better. I do not like the product but if you must have it, make sure check the return policy."
4,Thunder Cave,"Thunder CaveThunder Cave, by is an adventurous book with suspense. Jacob Lansa an average 14 year old that lives in Brooklyn. There he lives with his mom and stepfather Sam, and across the globe, Dr. Robert Lansa, Jacob dad, is studying elephants in Kenya. A fiasco forces Jacob to go to Kenya, there he runs into chaos left and right, battling the blistering heat and carnivores he presses on. As soon as it starts getting better and they meet one of the most wanted type of gang, poachers. Can Jacob escape form the diabolical grasp of poachers and soon reunite with his father? Will he stop all the slaughter of the elephants? To find out read Thunder Cave!"
4,A Fun Read,"Although I'm in high school, I recently reread the book and found it refreshing. It's not very sophisticated, but it is a nice read. Also, Jacob's reactions to events in his life were quite... intriguing, to say the least."
5,the best book ever,this is a great book! this storey took place in kenya africa. a boy named jacoob lansa is looking for his father dr. robert lansa a feild biologist trying to save the african elephants. when jacoob nearly dies an african native man named supeet finds jacoob and helps jacoob find his dad! great book!!!
4,"very good, but not quite classic","This is the only Sonny Clark-led Bluenote that strikes me as ""only"" very good, even excellent, but not a classic. Mind you, any album with both Hank Mobley and Sonny Clark is well worth your time, but it doesn't seem to have the note-to-note inevitability of his other albums. I guess I'm talking about that indefineable thing called chemistry. There seemed to be more of it between trombonist Curtis Fuller and John Coltrane on the previous Sonny's Crib. Perhaps Sonny just came out with another album too soon after the last one (September 1, '57 for Sonny's Crib, November 10, '57 for Dial ""S""). In any case, I'm speaking in relative terms here, and this album still deserves four-and-a-half stars."
1,Back by Midnight,"Back by Midnight has to be the worst movie i have seen in a long time. It was a waste of my money.I feel ripped off.I feel bad for Rodney Dangerfield to be associated with such a horrible script.His name was the only reason I bought the Movie without ever having seen it before.It was a waste of 90 minutes of my life to even watch it. Rodney Dangerfield must have needed the money when he agreed to do this film.I will remember Rodney for his stand up comedy, for the Movies Easy Money, and Back to School.Back By Midnight was a waste of a great comics talent.R.I.P. Rodney you are still one of the comic greats. But this Movie is a BIG AND TOTAL DUD:("
2,*yawn,"It had a couple laughs, but it got very old after the first 30 minutes, and then it started falling into the very dumb category. Like ""naked gun"" kind of dumb, maybe even worse than that"
5,A great little hunting game for the PSP!!! Cabela's Dangerous Hunts delivers!!!,"Great hunting fun for the Sony Playstation portable (PSP)!!! Cabela's Dangerous Hunts does take a while to learn, but when once you get the hang of it,it's a pretty fun game!!! Great graphics and sound!!! The nice thing about this game is you don't have to travel 100's of miles to a have great day's hunting,you can do it at home or on the go with your trusty PSP!!! Note for you parents out there,this game is for adults and late teens,not for the children,it's a bit on the violent side!!! So if you want a nice little hunting game for your PSP,this one delivers!!! Two thumbs up!!! Five stars!!! A+"
3,One of Spain's greatest contributions,"Pure and simple, one of the top Spanish films I have ever seen! You'll love this bumbling set of geriatric bank robbers!"
5,"Review for ""Ghost Tribe""","""Ghost Tribe"", o la Tribu Fantasma. Una de las mejores aventuras del Teniente Blueberry. Episodio siguiente a ""Nariz Rota"".

5,just like home,"If you add the veges to the gravy it's just like home. Love the flat fried noodles, can eat right out of the package."
1,Not Recommended,"Once upon a time, this was the STUFF. You couln't find a better chow mein mix. Sadly, the company which produces the product had a fire. They rebuilt, but their product now tastes as though they have added the remnants of the fire to their recipe. Threw away five boxes - brand new - in one sitting. Every bag of noodles I opened smelled (and ultimately tasted) like diesel fuel, paint thinner - pick your poison. Save your money. Find a good Chinese reataurant."
1,Smells like Latex Paint,"Since the fire at their original plant the noodles smell like latex paint. There was a recall because of this problem and it lasted 1 month. I just found out about this problem yesterday, about 2 months too late. So I called the factory and was told I would have to return the 2 boxes I have to them and they would give me 2 fresh boxes. Who ever heard of a company asking it's customer to bring their defective product to their factory at the customers expense. These are Chow Mein noodles worth $2.00 a box. Well Hoo-Mee your Chow Mein is in the garbage barrel and I'll never buy your products again."
3,Hard to jump when the seams pop,My only complaint about this product that I have had to patch it 4 times in the first 72 hours we had it. All of the patches were on the seams. The trampoline was inside on a carpeted surface and never had more than 100 lbs total weight. Frustrating for me but the kids have really enjoyed it.
3,A Useful Read,"In Anne Rivers Siddons' book Nora, Nora, she captures the emotions of a 12 year old girl and unleashes them in a still racially-drawn South during the heat and turmoil of 1961. She sends a distant relative to relieve this girl of her pent-up preteen angst and of her father's sheltered life and changes it into something to talk about. Again Siddons has proven herself worthy of throwing herself into a life other than her own and turning it into something happy. With her colourful depiction and mysterious twist, Nora, Nora is a useful read that will soften hearts and bring a couple of laughs along the way."
1,Have'nt I read this before???,"Perhaps if I had been able to finish this book my review would have been different. Unfortunately, I was unable to sustain an interest. Harper Lee told it much better."
1,disapponted,"I have enjoyed Anne River Siddons' previous books, but it took me a long time to get through this one. The characters were somewhat implausible and the plot was even more so. Furthermore, the foul language was offensive and unnecessary. Why be so explicit? Give this one a pass!"
1,Stay away!,"WOW does this book suck. I only bought it because I was stranded in a place with no nearby bookstores and there was a drugstore selling this dreck. Whoo, if I can just protect one person from reading this horrendous made-for-tv magazine-fiction ""novel"", I will rest easy. It has no plot, no style, no insight, and no redeeming values (even for a book that's not intended to be either literary or thrilling). If you like Austen, Bronte, Maugham, Trollope, Fitzgerald, Dickens, Balzac, Shakespeare, or Dostoevesky you will HATE this book. Dimestore paperbacks can be great - try Grisham, Sue Grafton, or even Sandra Brown or Luanne Rice, but leave this one a wide berth...."
1,A big disappointment,"I usually love books written by ARS but found this one to be shallow and predictable. The part I found really hard to believe was when Nora revealed to Peyton the real reason Peyton's mother bled to death. If I'm reading this correctly, Peyton's mother had a sexual encounter on the day she gave birth? Come on, now! Any woman who has had a child knows this is next to impossible. Try harder next time, Anne."
3,Good Depiction of Teenage Perspective,"Although NORA NORA is not as riveting as COLONY and UP ISLAND, it is a good read. Siddons does a good job of depicting the thoughts and feelings of a teenage girl. Any woman will be able to recall similar thoughts and feelings as those experienced by the protaganist, young Peyton. Siddon's imagery in Peyton's physical transformation after Nora gives her a makeover is excellent. The characters are multi-dimensional, and Nora, as a teacher, will be familiar to and heart warming for all high school teachers. It was nostalgic and entertaining, a quick and easy read."
3,"Harmless, but disappointing","For Siddons fans who are hoping for another ""Colony,"" don't hold your breath. Maybe I'm just used to the shockers she likes to throw in, the truly surprising plot twists she usually comes up with, but when I learned the ""SHOCKING TRUTH"" (tuh-DUMM!) about Nora's past (according to the fly-leaf), all I could think was, ""So what?"" and, ""Oh, is THAT all?"" and, ""I can't believe I've spent all day reading to get to THIS!"" But, maybe it's just that the expectations are set unreasonably high when I pick up a Siddons novel. I don't resent having spent the time to read this novel, but it's not one I'll recommend to anyone. And as for the ending, all I could think of was the ending of ""Gone with the Wind,"" the idea that a sequel must be coming because the story isn't done yet. The whole novel just lacks development. Oh, well...On to Rosamund Pilcher's new one!"
2,"Good Quick Read, but wait till paperback or library","I, too, am a huge Colony, Outer Banks, Up Island fan. But this book was quick, shallow and fluff. Dont buy it in hardback wait for the paperback version or better yet a library rental. I felt that the story should have begun on the last page. The ending was too quick and contrived. To me, the better story would have begun there and moved on. I agree Siddons cranked this one out too quickly."
2,Not as good as author's previous books,"It seemed more aimed for teenagers than adults. I've enjoyed several of Ms Siddons other books, but this story did not have the depth of those."
4,"Nora, Nora - Wonderful Read","I loved this book -- both from an adult and teenager viewpoint! I will highly recommend this to any person over 14. Peyton and Nora were so vibrantly described throughout the book, that it seemed they had leaped off the pages to come entertain me. Rivers-Siddons writing touched me deep. I loved all her characters. I wanted more when the book ended. Can we please have a sequel???"
3,Already been done???,"Very much enjoyed this book. In some ways, the ending is a surprise.The writing lifts it above traditional Romance genre offerings and focuses as much on social issues as on any love-interests. The real ""story"", however, is Peyton - the very young daughter of a widowed father. Peyton learns life lessons and experiences the pain that such learning often causes.My only problem with the book is probably just my own - I kept thinking that Ms. Siddons was channeling Scout fromTo Kill a Mockingbird. There are similarities between the two novels but, of course, nothing can really compete with Harper's work. These overlapping themes, however, did cause me to back off from truly enjoyingNora, Nora: A Novel. I just felt that, in some ways, ""this"" had already been done. Most people probably won't experience the same retreat and I do highly recommend this book."
4,"Once again, Siddons transports me to another world","I read Anne River Siddons to escape from the daily stresses of an average life. My favorite book by her is still The Colony, but Nora, Nora transported me away to the deep South as well. I read it in one sitting, while swinging on the porch swing drinking iced tea. It's a perfect book to read on the beach as well. If you're looking for something light to read, this one is it. It also has a bittersweet, happy ending to leave a smile on your face for rest of the day."
4,"Slow Taking Off, But It Gets Better!","The beginning of this book is just a little bit hard to get into as it talks about a spoiled rotten kid who felt she had everything to do with killing her mother.But when Nora arrives, the plot thickens and the story becomes much more entertaining and engrossing from there on. Anne Rivers Siddons has a way of writing with a different style with each book she composes, and this one though written well, is quite differently written then her others."
3,my review,"Peyton McKenzie is a 12 year old girl who hides an incredible secret in her heart: Her mother died the day she was born and she blames herself for it. Destiny will put her cousin Nora in her path and with her she will find a new life, a new look and peace in her.The plot is interesting enough but somehow it does not grip you like other novels by the author. She places the story in the south, close to Atlanta in a small town in the 1960's a time of great changes in this area. The people are also interesting and their characters are well described.It is an easy novel to read but I somehow got used to reading books from this author with the caliber of a ""Peachtree Road"", and I don't see it here."
1,Great Poem...should have left it at that!,"I LOVED this poem, it was beautiful, ethereal, pleasing to the ear, idealistic, creative...everything a great poem should be. It pulled people in who shared the sentiments for a beautiful dream ride. The book however was a huge disappointment after the poem. Her writing style was easy and even pleasant to read but you got to the end wondering what exactly she had said. She criticized a lot of self help/new age thinking but her book seemed to do the same, just not nearly as well as some. She should have stuck with writing a beautiful poem and not tried to turn it into a book for commercial or social gain."
2,kind of woo woo,"Not to put down the author's life experiences, I found that beyond the nice poem ""the Invitation"", there was not much depth to this book. Nice poem though and it makes a nice evocation. I got it at the library otherwise I would not buy it."
1,Disappointing!,This book was chosen for our December book club thinking it might be an uplifting book for the holiday season. Not a single one of us liked the book (7 in all). We made our decision based on the poem which indeed sounded promising. We all found she contradicted herself quite often and it really was more or less one big pity party! Really deserves less than one star!
2,Poor and Confusing,"I bought this book for a friend based on the write up and the poem. Since he is away, I read through it and I am so glad I did. I am certainly not giving this as a gift, and I am glad to see that I am not the only who didn't like this book. Basically, I couldn't figure out her point. What is she talking about?I felt mildly depressed after reading it, and found it to be confusing--it seemed just like a string of anecdotes without any substance.I'm not sure that this is an invitation to, but sorry, Oriah, I don't accept."
1,Zero Stars,"This book was easy to read but empty of content. The lowest rating option is one star, else I would have rated it a big zero. The author liked to use word painting and her sentences flowed nicely, but if you're looking for insight, information, hope, knowledge, or anything other than learning about the mistakes in life the author has made (was this meant to be an autobiography?), save your money. Frankly I was amazed after reading it -- amazed at the positive reviews the book has on it's back cover. Quite a disappointment."
4,View from the male side.,"Thought this book was well worth the time to read. Enjoyed the ideas of having deeper relationships. From a male point of view, this book will give an insite into the workings of the female physic."
1,The ramblings of a distraught woman,"The writings and ramblings of an emotional woman. She justifies faithlessness by the needs of our egos to be free! Are you kidding?! If this is poetry or ""fine prose"" I must be reading another titled book. What a waste of time and money."
1,Silly new age self-indulgence,"This book is written as if it is a parody of a new age self-help book. I simply can't believe that any intelligent person would take it seriously. I heard of the poem and it is sort of nice in a new agey way. The book, which I looked at in a bookstore, is just laughable. Come on, people!"
5,"A little slow to start, then packed with power","For me, the beginning of the book was very slow, but once I completed the first chapter, I knew I was reading something which spoke to my soul. This book is full of lost ""common"" sense and encouragement for us all to listen to inner selves - with practical advise on how to do this and meaningful personal stories. Remember, intuition is a like a muscle - the more you use it, the stronger it becomes."
5,Transforming,"My fiance' and I discussed having The Invitation prose read at our wedding ceremony. It touched us both at our very core, but we hesitated to do this for fear the challenging message would not be received the way we intended in a large crowd of people who had not had the privilege of reading the book. We were wrong. It was beautifully read when we wed and the comments have been wonderful. We provided each guest a copy in a small scroll commemorating the event, the reader and the book. We have had several people give us their own interpretations and will certainly be buying a copy of this book for themselves. It made our very special occasion truly rewarding because we shared Oriah Mountain Dreamer's meaningful words and they were warmly received by a vast array of friends."
3,Uplifting,I have rad many inspirational books. They all have the same flavour with the authors personal experice as an influence this book is like that. Oriah has included exercises and mediations for you to follow and it is easy to understand. Good for those seekeing support on thier spiritual jouorney.
3,Not an easy read,Difficult at times to relate to. The exercises at the end of the chapters were helpful at times. Need to be a focused person who meditates. The prose is beautiful.
5,The Invitation (Plus),"This is an amazing book. I needed some thoughtful reading, help reflecting on my own questions, and this was the best tool for me. I recommend this book for anyone who needs guidance on their journey."
4,"My ""I have to own this book"" book","I first heard a couple of passages on relationships from Ohriah at a church, a black tie fundraiser and such so when I came across her book, I knew it had to be mine. She speaks so profoundly and yet simply about what really and I mean, what really matters in any relationship and she writes from experience."
2,"Nice Poem, Lean substance","The Poem the Invitation is interesting and moving. However, the author's attempt to fill out the thinking and emotions behind it falls short. This is not really billed as a ""new age"" book but in all actuality it is. Dreamer repeats herself and the same ideas over and over again. I think that anybody reading this book will want to know how a person like this can survive in the world. I am convinced that this means something to the author. Unfortunately if you are drawn to the book through the peom i would suggest reading the first two chapters in the bookstore before you buy it. By this point you will know whether you can handle this type of writing. Mainstream people looking for good, solid, and workable solutions will be disappointed."
4,Excellent option when you need a sound-proof practice room,"The product works as advertised, which I can't really say for most products with as much marketing material as the Silent Brass System for Trombone. I have a slightly older revision of SBS and use it regularly in my apartment.As another reviewer mentioned more emphatically, make sure you don't become dependent on the resistance and feedback from the mute. It definitely changes all of my trombones drastically versus an open horn, but I won't go as far as to dissuade owning one. Practicing with the mute is 100% improvement over no practice at all!"
5,"Great buy, but shouldn't be used all the time","Professional player here, and this is a quality practice mute. Nearly silent and produces a good sound through the amp with minimal resistance on the embouchure. Because using the mute feels a little different from normal playing it should not be used all the time, but for those late night practice sessions this is an indispensable tool. Works great, I highly recommend this for all Trombone players."
5,Very good product,It's very good tho be able to practice any time any where.It's also good to warm up before a gig.The sound on the earphone is very good with a deep low tone.
2,inaccurate description of item,"I ordered this because I like the scent and prefer perfume spray. When the package arrived, it contained a 1 ounce bottle of perfume with a dropper and no spray. It's too much of a hassle to send it back but the description is wrong."
4,Bonnie Blue Murder,Very well written and interesting book. Really enjoyed the descriptions of the charectors and of Charleston. Hope this is the beginning of a series.
1,pitiful,This product was bought on a whim. I was amazed at how bad it was. Poorly concieved and executed.No story no plot no action.
4,Bought for my teenager.,"Teenage angst meets video games. I thought it was repetitive, but my teens love it. Cartoon violence, absurdity, and Sartre on a DVD. I'm an old dork, so it doesn't appeal to me."
4,Gets most stains out,"Spot Shot is a very good product and gets most stains out. I was able to get crayons markings and red orange punch from out of the carpet that my 2 yr old grandson left behind. However, it couldn't get the Downey fabric softener out (he climbed on the washer and got it out the cabinet) in which he so graciously decided to show his creativity on his bedroom carpet. (smh)"
5,Excellent,This is a great product.It really works.It removes the tough stains within minutes.I would highly recommend this product.Worth buying it.
3,sprayer broke.,"This product is great for spots on your carpet. However, the sprayer broke on both of my bottles. that's why I am giving only 3 stars."
2,Really didn't do much,"Even on fresh carpet stains like cranberry juice, Spot Shot really didn't deliver. I had to repeatedly blot at the stains, but when it dried, I still see the stains on the carpet. In fact, it just spreads the stain rather than eliminate it. I would skip this one and look for an alternative cleaner."
3,It works,It works but buy it in the store. It is overpriced here. I found much cheaper at Big Lots. Works as described.
5,"SPOT SHOT INSTANT CARPET STRAIN REMOVER,TRIGGER SPRAY 22 0Z",THIS WORK VERY GOOD AND SEND IT FAST IT WORK REAL GOOD ON CARPET AND SELL VERY GOOD.
2,Not Pet Safe!,"I had high hopes for this product after reading the reviews here, and I was shocked to see all the cautions and poison contact information on the bottle! To make matters worse, one bottle had leaked extensively into the plastic bag it was in.I just don't feel safe using this as I have pets. I will stick with Natures Miracle from now on."
5,Barney,"I was so happy to find this ornament for my grandson, he absolutly loves Barney and it is very hard to find Barney items, it was a little more than I wanted to spend but the product was in perfect shape so I was happy and so was my grandson!"
4,they all get to be the same after awhile,As I said all of her CD's sound the same after awahile.As much as I love Doreen there has to be a way to change the style.
2,Didn't meet my expectations,"I was disappointed. It was just a talk, did not include inter-active participation. It should have been on u-tube for free. I love Doreen, but skip this one."
1,Bobbitt's VW Bus Book,"I'm not sure why there was a need for this book?! The ground it covers is not new, and has been done as well--- or better by others! The many b/w photos are faded looking, and the very few color pictures are of often seen brochures...or rather uninteresting VWs. This soft-bound book is printed on good heavy glossy stock, and the content is fairly factual. My advice is to take your $$ and buy the superb VW bus book by Seume/Steinke, or the also fairly good VW bus books by Schiffer/Zeichner or Meredith."
2,2nd time i try to buy an original EPSON ribbon and it comes to me DRY ....,"2nd time i try to buy an original EPSON ribbon and it comes to me DRY ....I think the OLD inventory of EPSON ribbons is being resold to end users like me buy marketers of obsolete or dated products.This has happened when buying them in the office supply stores, the EPSON BRAND ribbons are dry, very light and unappealing print quality. They are NOTHING LIKE THEY USED TO BE. I guess I will have to go back to buying non-EPSON printer ribbons for my dot matrix printers."
4,Nice arrangements,This book has many of the songs that others do not and the music is arranged nicely. It is not beginner but is not too difficult which is good since I typically get my Christmas music out around Thanksgiving and don't want to have to practice too much to play the songs. The only drawback to this book is that if you want to have words with the arrangements there are none. Maybe I should have realized that since it was piano solos but many of my piano books do have the lyrics. I will have to order another book for vocals.
3,An Ok Book,"I like the arrangements, though they start to sound similar, and are fairly generic. I also wish there were more of the traditional Christmas Carols instead of some of the more obscure ones."
2,Very un-satisfied,"I returned this item as soon as I rcvd it (had not even open them, knew they were the wrong item). I have yet to receive my refund!!! I had placed a second order after realizing I had ordered the incorrect item, that product itself is very good.SincerelyBernadettePSI have e-mailed the company twice & no reply!!"
3,too short,These compression stockings were too short for me. They seem like they probably would have worked ok for a shorter woman.
5,So much helpful information!,"In the pursuit of our musical goals, many resources claim that for a small fee they can help pave the way to success. I have found that the resource thus far to deliver such success has been The Indie Bible.I have received many great reviews and have seen a lot of air play for my music from sources I would have never known about had it not been for David Wimble's effort in compiling so much helpful information. My press kit is chucked full of positive press from around the WORLD because of The Indie Bible. For the do-it-yourself indie artist, The Indie Bible is to a musician what a life jacket is to a sailor!"
1,Returned this to Amazon,"I may have received a defective item but I didn't want to waste my time trying another. Studs were apparantly 4"" in width and it wouldn't detect AC unless placed on top of an outlet or switch. I even checked it on a wall with an open back to verify it didn't work properly. I sent it back and purchased a Zircon Pro SL-AC from a local merchant and it works just fine."
5,Excellent!,Couldn't ask for a better sensor. I checked against the wires and studs through my drywall and can confirm its accuracy.
1,Sent me wrong item twice.,I ordered BDL153S but I got BDL150S. I replaced the order and still got the same wrong item. Finally I returned the wrong item and get it from somewhere else.
2,Rose Cross College,"The book has a nice binding, but the pages within are facsimiles (copies) of an old publication, which includes underlining, markings, and way too much ink on some pages, so that the letters are blurrs. The print on each page is too close to the binding and is actually incorporated into the binding: You can't see the end of each sentence on the left-hand page, and you can't see the begining of each sentence on the right-hand page.As for content, the last lecture is about the only thing that interested me: ""The Origins of Symbolism."" The begining of the book is some sort of written description of a ceremony; not very valuable to me, but I guess you would have had to be there to appreciate the written description. I would not recommend this book.By the way, the reason I purchased this book was because I heard a William Cooper (Hour of the Time) broadcast where he actually read aloud the lecture on ""The Origins of Symbolism."""
1,rip off,"the site misled me into thinking I was buying the proper New Albion recording, with liner notes, which are essential for this. Instead a dubious copy (""ioda, digital done right"") arrives, no liner notes, not even the right track numbers, or the subtracks indicated, as they are on the original CD. Its outrageous that they charge full price for a burned CD. I don't think this is even legal?"
5,Great resource!,I had to use this book for a college course. It was an excellent resource. I hope to read more about this author.
5,Great Shape!,I received Mannix Seventh Season in a timely fashion and in great shape. I would definitely recommend this to anyone!!
5,Mannix 7th season.,I was not disappointed with season 7. There were some episodes that I liked better than others but all were worthy of my time and undivided attention. I loved Mannix but somehow never got to see all of it so I was delighted to find them on DVD. There were places where the audio wasn't very loud and volume was being adjusted constantly but that was a technical problem which didn't take anything away from the series.
5,Mind-Blowing,"Mannix Season 7 has all the elements that made ""Mannix"" a great show. After seven seasons these elements had been honed and perfected resulting in episodes that you will want to watch again and again. The Film noir - inspired style, the compelling plots, the action and the suspense are all there. Bravo!"
3,workd like it is supposed to,This is OK for an entry level drill. If I had to do it again I would probably get a better one. Plus I would go up to an 18V drill like a rigid or a dewalt.
2,Anthology Falls Flat,"This is not an anthology which I find myself able to recommend. John Adams is the most significant composer represented here; yet the work included by him is merely an excerpt. The complete work can be found elsewhere, paired with ""Shaker Loops.""The works by Satoh, Dresher, and Scott are interesting enough, while the I find the works by Marshall and Lentz quite inaccessible."
5,Great backpack,I got this as an alternative to using my purse when I go places that involve me carrying or chasing around my son for long periods of time. It is a perfect little backpack for me (it is not large like the average size school backpack). And the monkey that comes with it is very cute too. Being waterproof is also a very good plus as well.
5,Kipling bags,I have a lot of Kipling products that I will not change for nothing the bags you can wash on your washer and they never get bad and the big ones I wash then with no problems I have some of them for years . I recommend this products to everybody. they r good for kids for school because u can wash them and last for years
3,Not as good as the firefly backpack,"I loved the kipling firefly backpack so much I wanted to purchase one for my mom. I ordered the honeybee one by mistake and am disappointed since it is not as practical as the firefly. Still, it is sturdy and lightweight and well made. I just don't like the drawstring for the main compartment because it's not as secure."
4,"Makes you wish you were one of ""her"" writers...","I am so glad Leonard Marcus researched the author Margaret Wise Brown, which led him to her editor, Ursula Nordstrom, which resulted in this collection of Nordstrom's letters. They're as hard to put down as the best novel...warm, chatty and, most importantly, insightful. The only thing that's missing is some of the back-story: What caused Nordstrom's falling-out with Meindert DeJong? Mary Stolz? Louise Fitzhugh? Nevertheless, a delightful look at arguably one of the most influential editors of this century and an important contribution to the understanding of literature for children."
4,Great rainy day book...pass it along!!!,"The chemistry between Patty Jane & Harriet made me wish I had a sister.They kept it together despite the fact that their parents were alcholics.The love that Avel Ames gave to Harriet is second to none.My heart goes out to little Nora she took care of a man she didn't even know,But grew to love and except. I can personally identify with her.This is the best book by a new author,can't wait for her latest novel."
4,Don't let the title fool you...,"I have to admit, I purchased this book because I was looking for a story that was going to make me laugh. The title and the description on the back was the prime reason for buying this book. But I have to say how surprised and pleased I was that PATTY JANE'S HOUSE OF CURL turned out to be so meaningful. I laughed as I knew I would; I cried, especially over the last chapter; and I was completely fulfilled after reading the Epilogue, which cinched the entire purpose of the book into a few pages. I enjoyed this book immensely and recommend it highly."
3,"a ""home-spun"" saga women's lives in the mid-century midwest","The book covers decades in the lives of Patty Jane, her daughter, her sister, and her mother-in-law. The women go through various crises and develop a loving, supportive family as well becoming stronger, more independent, and a resource for growth in the women around them. I judged the book only average because I felt like I never really got to know the insides of the characters. It was all told from the outside -- I knew nothing more than I would know if I were merely observing these people from a distance."
3,A Mixture of Sorts,"[....] I agree with comments on both sides of the fence. This book is not for everyone, but I really enjoyed it. I would agree [...] that this novel does have some unbelievable plot twists, but if you take it for what it is-a fun read with some twists and turns of sadness mixed in, I think you will enjoy it. Patty Jane's House of Curl does have the same essence as Steel Magnolia's. The characters are quirky and lovable. If you've read Where the Heart Is, this novel is similar in that a lot of tragedy does occur. Just when things start going well, you can be sure that something sad is lurking around the corner. But I feel the characters are developed and the setting is a cozy one. I really enjoyed this book and will read more by this author."
2,Lake Wobegon It's Not!,"The comparisons to G. Keillor on the back cover encouraged me to buy this book and I must say I was very disappointed. As a descendent of Norwegian-Americans, I loved the references to lutefisk and Lutheran stoicism, but I found the writing choppy, the plot twists utterly ridiculous and the characters underdeveloped. This book seemed to be an attempt at a heartwarming portrayal of Midwest living, and the bizzare kidnapping subplot was completely out of place. I didn't feel like I really knew the characters or really wanted to get to know them."
4,It's better the second time.,I read the book and it was okay-- a little simple and certainly not great literature. But it was entertaining and I enjoyed the characters and dialogue. I then found the book on tape and listened to it and it was wonderful. I carried the tape and listened at every opportunity. Maybe I just didn't read it right the first time! I cried and learned to appreciate my sisters all over again.
3,No doubt you'll recognize several characters in this book.,"This story is extraordinarily ordinary. Nearly everyone is badly wounded, but on the way back. I'd expected Patty Jane to practice more psychiatry, but she's so practical she's wise. There are some surprises in the men who come into the lives of House of Curl women. This is a quick read, a good story for a hot summer afternoon."
3,Sweet yet not totally fulfilling,"This book was sweet, but it lacked depth. I cared about the Dobbin sister's, but I never felt that I was fully sucked into their lives or could relate with them. Also many of the MN referances were lost on me or I found to be completely implausible--and I've lived in MN nearly all my life. I've heard that people say ""Oufda""--but what the heck is ""oufda mayda""?? For cripes sake ;-) Overall, it was a fun summer read."
3,Middle of the road reading experience,"It isn't shakespeare, but it is a pleasant read. I liked Your Oasis on Flame Lake more. Poor Harriet, she must have been born under a black cloud. Still I will read the authors other books."
2,Just got worse and worse to the point of comedy,I enjoyed Angry Housewifes so I picked up this book - my 2nd from this author. The book started out pretty good - however as I read on I was shaking my head. I lost faith in the characters and in the story.
1,Ugh,"To say this novel is mediocre would be doing it a favor. Characters, plot, and writing are tiresome, unimaginative and pedestrian in that order. Save your brain cells (why did I waste mine? Some one in my discussion group recommended it)"
1,Is there a space for negative stars?,"I can only say that I am completely shocked that this book got more than one good review, much less dozens of them. This book was completely boring. Like another reviewer, I've just read the two Ya-Ya books and it's more like comparing a Rolls to a roller skate. I only wish that I hadn't spent actual money on it. It took me back to my high school days where I HAD to read something. I forced myself to read this, hoping it would get better, but I shouldn't have wasted my time. Absolutely the ONLY part not totally awful was the Epilogue, which I'm kind of thinking someone else must've written. If you want a summary of my feelings about this book, read every review with a star rating under a 2."
2,a little boring & predicatable,"The book was ok. That's about it. The characters were poorly developed so that you never really get to the place of caring a whole lot about any of them or the unbelievable things that happen during the course of their lives.I live in the neighborhood where the story takes place but if it weren't for that, I probably wouldn't have even finished it.My advice: Save your money."
1,Patty Janes house of curl,I purchased this book because Ivillage said this was a good read. How wrong can someone be. I thought this book was so boring I couldn't wait to finish. I'll be more careful about my picks after this. To the many readers who liked this book I just don't get it.
2,"Skip & Read ""She Flew the Coup""","Not bad. But not real good either. My Tip: Skip this and read Michael Lee West's ""She Flew the Coup,"" which is as funny as it is moving."
5,"Quick, fun, enjoyable read!","I host a book chat on the net and have been hearing about this books for ages. I picked it up and read it in one afternoon because I could not put it down! These ladies live in all of us...so you will laugh, you will cry, and you will be glad you picked this book up!"
4,A moving novel with almost too many tragic coincidences,"The writing is smart and the dialogue is snappy and believable. I found the hardships in the character's lives borderline contrived, but not so much that I couldn't enjoy the story. Perhaps witnessing so many tragic coincidences happening to otherwise good people pushed me too much out of the novel's fictional world.The House of Curl salon is where the Dobbin sisters forge their strongest bond, and their relationship is the emotional hinge of Patty Jane's House of Curl. I was also touched by the persistent theme of finding eternal meaning in the daily interactions of those you love."
5,Truly one of the best books I have ever read!!!,I just happened upon this book at the store and thought it looked good. Little did I know that it would end up being one of the best books I have ever read. I have lent it to everybody I know and they also enjoyed it. This should definitely be an Oprah pick!!
3,"witty characters, a midwestern Steel Magnolias","Having lived my most of my life in Minnesota I loved the midwestern setting. Her characters's were real, funny and sad all at the same time. Landvik paints a wonderful picture of small town life, love and friendship. Another good author to try is Bobbie Leets or Jon Hassler..."
4,More than beauty,"This is so much more than hair and nails and beauty products. (I wish we had one in our neighborhood.) This is a place where you can take care of the whole you, not just outside appearance. It's kind of like Oprah meets Paul Mitchell and then some! Getting to that place though was sometimes a lovely happy time of love and joy; other times of anguish. Besides her sister Harriet and her adorable Norwegian mother in law Ione,(Still not sure how to pronounce that name) her daughter and shop regulars,the unusual/unlikely family Patty Jane brought together through her brainstorming solution of making her Beauty Shop more than hair and makeup was what develops this story into complex sub plots and deep meaning. This is a really wonderful read with entertaining characters from a Minnesota town. You won't be bored as this is a page turner with heart and humor. P.S. I gave it only four stars because I'm so in love with the next book she wrote after House of Curl, The Book Club."
1,Amatuer writing!,"Am I the only person who thought this book was a waste of time! I recently went to a book club meeting and proclaimed the writing ""amateur""....I might not be invited back! I suppose it's fine to read on the beach while baking in the sun, but I simply can't fathom the pull of this book. Predictable fantasy!"
2,Shallow and juvenile,"Sorry, but I could only take the first four chapters. The characters had no depth and the writing was amateurish. I had just finished reading ""Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood"" when I tried to read this book. Like comparing a Lexus to a Yugo."
1,Read fast before you lose interest,"Looking for the quintessential ""beach book""? A fast read? Cheap laughs? Shallow characters and a ridiculously unbelievable plot? Look no further! I don't know when I've encountered so many people undergoing so much trauma and about whom I cared so little. The author would benefit by taking a crash course in characterization, and that's just for starters. The best that can be said of this book is that it makes one appreciate GOOD writing."
2,"Great characters, ridiculous plot!","I was very drawn to this book based on the Minnesota setting. I thought this would be a Fannie Flagg type of humorous novel, lots of funny female characters, but with a Midwestern instead of Southern setting. The beginning of the book drew me in. The characters and the dialogue are just wonderful. But the plot! What a mess! Just got more and more unbelievable and bizarre. And several of the big plot twists were completely predictable. Just a real groaner as far as plot goes. So now I would have to say this is more of a Maeve Binchy lame-o novel, not a Fannie Flagg type of quality novel!"
3,Leisurely Reading,For a nice leisurely read this was a great book. I read it in a few days and was a bit disappointed becasue this was my second book by Landvik. Angry Housewives has it all over this one. I guess it's unfair to compare because they have nothing to do with one another. It was a nice read though.
5,As Enjoyable as a Trip to the Beauty Parlor,"Feminine fiction at its finest. Oh, BRIDGET JONES and similar titles are fine, but how refreshing it is to find a heroine in ""women's fiction"" who's concerned with something other than calories or the size of her hips.Patty Jane is an engaging character, an abandoned wife who pulls herself up by her bootstraps to raise her child, and the love stories are funny, sad, and charming. I recommend it highly."
4,"Homey, sad and sweet","Patty Jane Dobbin and her sister, Harriet, go through what they call 'The Dobbin Terrain - all hills and valleys'. They experience loss, illness, friendship, birth, depression, new starts, the ugliness of alcoholism, love and laughter. Ms. Landvik has the ability to make you cry and then immediately laugh. Very good novel. I recommend it."
5,I cried my eyes out and laughed my head off,"Anyone with a sister, or anyone who loves people, humor, and life, will love this book. Thank you Lorna"
2,I was very disappoointed with this product,I do not recomend purchasing this product. It is not worth the money. You can buy a drugstore or Wal-mart brand that gives you the same results. Leaves hair stiff and gummy unmanageable.
5,Great Interiors,"This book varies from most books on Wright and the prairie style architects in its extensive use of interior photos. Many of the prairie homes are somewhat unremarkable from the outside, while inside they have a distict beauty and grace. ""Prairie Style"" beautifully portrays the interior as well as the exterior of homes by Wright, his students, and contemporaries."
3,Pulskamp,"This book does have a very nice blend of photographs and reproductions of sketches and interior / exterior images, but I was not impressed with the cross over into other architect's work that, in my humble opinion, do not come close to approaching FLW's ability. Overall it is a good resource, but hardly a definitive study on Wright and his structures."
4,a good solid disc,this Brother could Sing.Two Wrongs(don't make it right was the Jam.i first saw David peaston on Showtime at the Apollo.he would win every week.and then this disc came out.God Bless the Child was good.if giving the right Material he would have been a real force.
5,David,"This man is truly amazing. My brother bought this cd when it first came out and I instantly fell in love with it. His range is unbelievable! The entire cd is great! He's in a play right now in the bay area (calif) and it made me wonder what he's been doing...broadway? musicals? I wish he would come out with another cd, I wouldn't hesitate to buy it."
4,Water? Hah!,"The most durable large wine glass I've ever owned, it's been our standard for 4 years. I recently went to a very nice restaurant here in DC and they now use these glasses as well for their red wines. Large bowl, elegant but not flimsy stem, holds a 1/4 bottle pour with plenty of breathing room. Perfect for daily wine drinkers who find themselves breaking a lot of the flimsier ""higher end"" glasses.Actually made by Schott Zwiesel, btw."
5,Life lessons for us all,"Inspirational is a good word to describe this book. Instructive is another. In a disarmingly warm and personal approach, Bogino builds a pathway to better days by tracing her journey from tragic events to the discovery of principles she uses as bootstraps to positive ways of living. It simply is not possible to read this book without feeling inspired to live better--regardless of one's current circumstances."
5,Great!!!,"Diane really encompasses many tools in her book to help women overcome 'victim thinking'. She has shown much courage, strength and resilience throughout her life and shares her story of that journey. She has used the lessons she has learned throughout her life to put together a guide for other women who have faced, or are facing, similar circumstances. She puts everything in an easy to understand (and often times humorous) format that really shows that you CAN accomplish these important goals. This woman has truly accomplished amazing things in her life and is certainly someone to be proud of and look up to. I know this for a fact........she's my mom!! :)~ Brittany M. Newberry, RN, MSN, MPH - Clinical Nurse Educator"
1,Worst book I have ever read on the subject,"This is absolutely one of the worst books Ive ever read on this topic. Writing style is elementary at best and the author makes ""jokes"" that are so out of sync with the topic. spent sooo much time talking about her own story and never really gets to the ""hows"" of getting better. I threw it away because I didnt want to pass it along to anyone else."
5,The perfect Girl Talk book!,"This book is hillarious. I literally spent all night talking with my friends about it! There are guys in here that are exactly like the men that you meet- and it makes you think of all the people you know that are like them. Quite a conversational topic- and great coffee table book! I've already bought 3 for other friends. Funny, the person that wants to read it the most is my boyfriend!"
2,Not what you think it is...,"""It's my favorite tool"" or so I told my kids when they gave it to me for my birthday. In reality, it is a basic laser pointer in a fancy package. Yes, it produces a straight laser line on the wall or floor, but you need to use a manual level to get it correct. It is difficult to hang on the wall and cannot be done without putting a small nail hole in a spot where you probably don't want one. Spend the extra money and buy a better mounting, self leveling and more accurate one if you need things to be absolutely perfect."
2,"good concept, incomplete design","I purchased mine for $5 at a clearance bin at one of those big hardware outfitters. A great price considering it started off at $30.The concept of a magnetic base was great but the magnet is too weak to hold itself up, even on a sheet of iron. It could've been really usefull with a stronger magnet for leveling a row of server cabinets in a computer datacenter and I guess I'll try to retrofit a stronger magnet in it.I haven't given the pinhole mounts a try yet but since you have to make a hole in the drywall, it's probably best suited for shelving a garage or a project basement or toolshed.I couldn't go wrong for the price but if it just had a stronger magnet I would have given it 3 stars."
1,Door Stop,"This is the BIGGEST waste of money there is. I can eye a better level line than this thing. It doesn't give you a level line until you use a real level, to level it???? whats the point??? Save your money. This thing makes a better door stop than a laser level."
1,Worst Laser Level Ever,This is awful. I can't believe I spent $5 on it - what a waste of $$!The line is completely inconsistent and even curves downward. There's no way it's level. This is at best a kids' toy and not a professional tool.
2,Refurbished,"On product detail should say ""refurbished"", I ordered one and I have to order a replacement because it is defective and I saw that the replacement is also refurbished"
4,Cute and funny!,"Actually, I heard the soundtrack album (TODAY, by the New Christy Minstrels) quite a while before I ever saw the movie. Not very surprisingly, I loved the movie, too. With a cast that included Glenn Ford, Joan Blondell, and all the other talented actors, how could you go wrong? The plot was good, and didn't cause the old I've-seen-this-before feeling that a lot of comedies do. Enjoyed every minute of it. My only quibble with it (and the reason it didn't get five stars) is that for some inexplicable reason it was filmed in black-and-white. It would have been fantastic in color. But don't let that stop you from seeing it---I just ordered a copy anyway, and will be watching it again."
4,Great Christmas for my grandson,"My grandson absolutely loves this truck and it is enough to keep him occupied for hours, but as with anything there is always room for improvement, my only complaint is that it could have a working radio, and it was a little pricey but well worth it."
4,Great toy!,Truck was easy to put together and runs well although its quite noisey.Looks great with all the decals--grandson loves it!
4,Power Wheels Ford F150,"I received my package quite fast, it was a birthday present for my son.When we received the truck my husband built it, we had the battery charged and ready but the car would not work. So, we found a place that worked on Power Wheels and they fixed the problem.It was a let down that my son couldn't ride it right away, and we had to go through all that, but the bottom line is..we got it repaired, it works now and my son loves it."
5,excellent,My son loves his truck! He rides it every chance he gets. we have had no issues with it at all the battery last a couple weeks before it needs charging again even though he rides it all the time. Overall I am completely happy with the truck!
5,baught as a gift for 2 year old nephew,we baught it for my 2 year old nephew and he absalutley loves it couldnt be happier with it. It had a couple of indent scratches on it when we recieved it but what do you exspect its plastic and its a kids toy so no big deal but other than that everything was there for me to put it together and it took and hour and half total what took the longest was putting the stickers on.
3,broken out of the box,"we made the mistake of not checking the truck when it arrived , we waited untill the day before her birthday to put it together to find the broken piece of the rear fender ,(looked like it had been dropped in shipping) and the missing push bar that goes infront of the front bumper the box was taped shut cant figure out how it was not there .so we taped the 5""by 2"" piece back on the truck and gave it to my grand daughter the next day she really liked it but it bothers me that they dont have some foam around it inside the box, lets face it our shipping companys do not handle packages like they are there own."
4,Great buy for your money,"From our experience - it was EASY to put together. I wouldn't tell you how much our son loves this toy - he would love any truck like this or all of them ;-) It seems a little bit too loud and squicky. And it is lack on front panel things like some other trucks (buttons, phone etc.) But overall it does what it should and for the less amount of money then other trucks. 4 stars!"
2,for the suburbs only,"do not purchase this if you live in the city. the car is big. you need plenty of room for your child to drive this around and it goes faster than you might think and it makes plenty of noise. i bought this for my 3 year old grandson; steering the car is not that easy, putting his foot on the pedal and just foward is easy enough but he has to bend down to the floor of the car to hit the button to go in reverse and then hit it again to go foward. but, beware, it does go!! and if there isn't open space it will go into anything in the way. I think a foot pedal car is a much better idea for a child."
1,Missing parts unable to use product!!,To date did not receive all the parts for the toy. Unable to use or put it together. Have contacted the supplier several times and was told he's having a hard time getting the parts but will try to get it. August 16th 2010(today's date. Purchase date: middle of July 2010. Very disappointed about shipment.
4,A little bit hard to steer.,We got this truck for out 2 year old to ride in. He's a little bit young for it but he knows how to drive it by putting his foot on the pedal. It is very hard for h im to turn the steering wheel. It took him a while to learn to steer but he enjoys it. The weight limit sayd 65 pounds but I have a secret. I have sat on the back and drove it many of times and I weigh well over twice that. The truck isn't that bad for younger ones.
5,Worth Every Penny,A great toy beloved by my grandson and his brother. Great fun and great prestige as it rolls around the neighbourhood
5,my little boy loves this truck,"truck was a 3rd birthday present and since that day it is drove all over our yard, easy for small kids to learn to use, good traction & nice speed, wouold recommend buying an extra battery, or the 2 hour ""speed charger"" great toy for a resonable price. Very pleased."
3,Cipher Returns,"Cipher returns after probably about a five year hiatus with 'Children Of God's Fire'. If you've never listened to or heard of Cipher, imagine Converge if Sen Dog from Cypress Hill was their singer. Now, Cipher is definitely not a rap/metal band but amongst their mathcore/metalcore madness, there is a sort of hiphop vibe.The album is very political, filled with blastbeats, crazy time changes, piano breaks, and an MF Doom guest appearance. While this isn't the best album of 2005, its a pretty good effort put forth by an indie band with a message in a scene that has become all about image. Pick this up if you like your hardcore political and/or are a fan of Converge, Dillinger Escape Plan, or Candiria."
1,worthless,"I bought 3 of these for all of my displays, they cause an unbearable ghosting effect and blur on all 3 monitors. Don't bother with these."
3,This is an okay gun,"I got this gun two days ago. Its not bad but i have had better. It has nice looks and was pretty intimidating to my friends during yesterday's backyard game, but i had to constantly change mags b/c of the small capacity of it. I didnt want to use auto fire b/c it ran out extremely quickly so i played sniper with single shots. The best thing about this gun is the looks while the worst is the small capcity mag. I dont know if it was worth the money but i am not complaining"
3,response to ana cal,"i dont own the gun so i'll give it 3 stars. but to the person who aparently knows so much about airsoft, YOU'RE WRONG. 1, it's called a magazine not a clip. go google the definition of a gun clip. 2, since it has such a low fps, dont even bother with the sights. they just eliminate your perif. 3, use single shot or burst fire. learn how to conserve your ammo because if you ever go to a cqb, you'll be glad you did. it's a plastic gear box so you cant upgrade it. it's a good backyard skirmish weapon but nothing to use on the battlefield. i suggest you read about the world of airsoft before you even think about getting a gun. if you're interested then get a good gun. if not, dont get this thing just to have it."
1,Gun arrived DOA from DealNSteal,"For the price I wasn't expecting much, and what I got was even less than I expected. A dead gun. Charged the battery, put it in, loaded it up, and managed to fire like 5-10 pellets and it just stopped. Nothing dramatic, it just stopped.Verified that the battery had a charge, etc. The motor seems to have just burned out. Nothing.So I'm going to work on getting DealNSteal to have the gun returned and have them send me a new one. I'll follow up with the results.As for the gun, pretty poor quality construction. Paint peeling off anything painted. Grease or some kind of silicone lube all over the thing. Again, for $50, so what? I could live with it if it worked, but it lasted less than 30 seconds, sooo..."
3,Lots of typos,"I haven't finished reading this book yet. I'm really enjoying Kierkegaards wisdom so far, but this book has a lot of typos in it. It seems like every page has at least one. If you're someone who's going to be quoting from the book a lot, I'd recommend another translation or different publisher or something."
4,"Sometimes, mental disease is funny to watch","The movie depicts a true story on how a woman is hooked on an early extreme experience, and leaves a quiet, pleasant , ordinary, problem free life for prosecuting a career on her perversion. Never a medical lesson was so good explained, and few times ""common"" people acts better told. When I was a child, a school mate told me that movie makers were running out of subjects, romans and ancient mitology and western's subjects exhausted, and I had the idea that psychiatrist's offices would be a very good source of ideas. That film proves that the concept was not so bad. Enjoy an special part of every day's spanish life!"
4,A Good Introduction,"I enjoyed reading Second Sunrise. It introduced the characters, who are interesting, and set up the reader for the second book. I look forward to the rest of the books in this series."
1,Typos drive stake through awkward premise and prose.,"If you are lured to what one would hope would reflect meaningfully on the foundation provided by Hillerman or Doss, steer clear of this typo-filled cluster-hug of poor plot construction, incredible character development (NOT in a good way), and dialogue only believable if the characters involved in the discourse are suffering some excruciating intestinal malfunction. Other than that, have a ball!"
3,too soon to tell. I just installed it,"Installation, if you do it yourself, depends on your exixisting plumbing (I did not have a required sediment filter installed), is it copper, PVC or other, and how experienced you are with plumbing.Performance I don't know yet. You must disinfect your whole plumbing, quite a job with two bathrooms, laundry room, kitchen, refrigerator, dishwasher, all cold and hot, in and out of the house. I have not done that yet. Then, of course You will have to get your water tested before you know how well it works."
5,Cosmic Zen,"""What are you playing?"" she asked. ""It's driving me insane"" as we drove down Ocean Blvd in my 1969 convertible Mustang. ""It's Margaret Lang Tan playing Somei Satoh"" I replied as I hit the eject button on the CD player saving the music for myself later on...Do you want to hear something different? Profound? Cosmic? er...Zen? This is the CD for you but be careful who you play it with. Somei Satoh has several hard to find CD's all in a modern multi-cultural (East meets West) minimal Classical music with tape loops & sound effects. Highlights are: ""The Heavenly Spheres Are Illuminated By Lights"" which sounds like the western theory of Universal Big Bang meets Zen Buddhism philosophy using prepared piano with tape loops giving birth to the human voice. ""Birds In Warped Time II"" again uses prepared piano with tape loops setting free Jonathan Living Seagull expressed as a violin. If you like this CD, check out other Margaret Lang Tan or Somei Satoh CD's."
5,Good Cord.,Does what it is suppose to do and I use it for a controller keyboard. I bought 3' because ti limits the ltency between the controller and computer. Going with a shorter cord has worked like a charm. Good product!
3,Heavy duty,Very heavy duty but bulky hard to use in tight places would be good set for home use not pros
5,A MUST for all jazz people,"Great music, keeps u on your feet every last second. Excellent combination of insruments, and they are very talented. A mix of piano, drum, saxaphone, clarinet, and vives. U'll love it guaranteed!"
4,Wonderful book,"I don't get the low ratings for this book. I bought it for my 3.5 year old, and he loves the pictures. The story is great for him, and I wish there were more titles like this. Sure, the book will hit home best if you are an African American family, but all kids can learn from it.Basically, if you're giving it a low rating, the book either 1.) just wasn't for you, 2.) went over your head, 3.) upset you because you don't agree with the message that ""Black is beautiful."""
3,"Themes: Being unique, black is beautiful","Shared this story with 5th grade students before a visit from the author. Although I have 5th graders, they were engaged in the rhyming patterns and said Blackbird has ""swag."" I do not see this book as racist or exclusive, but rather promoting the black ""race"" and reminding everyone that black people have a lot to contribute. It also shows togetherness, yet being unique and believing in yourself. Would be a great story for Black History Month, or themes around differences and self-worth."
4,Fun and artistic,"This book is about a bird that stands out for being beautifully black. The rest of the birds are all different kinds of colors but wish to be beautiful like the black bird. The black bird helps them by painting them with a touch of black each even though Blackbird says ""Color on the outside is now what's on the inside."" This book sends out a great message about beauty being. It is easy to read along and has a few rhymes that make it an enjoyable read. The pictures are wonderful and crafty looking. As I read along I enjoyed the colorful pages."
1,A big letdown!,"When I bought Beautiful Blackbird, I anticipated a story that would capture my heart. I was extremely disappointed. The ""black is beautiful and every other color is not"" theme comes through loud and clear. Never in the story is the blackbird admired for anything other than his color. Fortunately, he agrees to share it by painting black brew onto the other birds who then celebrate their ""black"" spots. If it was intended to be a story that brings readers together, it has sadly missed the mark because it reeks of racism."
1,Universal Meaning...NUH-HU!,"BEWARE...your child may bring this book home from their PUBLIC SCHOOL LIBARY.The book states it has universal meaning, maybe in its orginal form as stated from a previous reviewer, but Ashley Bryan's adaptation makes it, should I say; ""monoversal."" The singular theme of this book is envy not pride for what color you are. Ashley Bryan writes in the book the ""color on the outside is not what's on the inside."" he failed to expound on that theme. This story left me feeling if you ain't black you ain't all that."
1,Toro trimmers have problems with feeding the line,"Toro trimmers have a basic design flaw. Note all the people complaining about the line feed on this trimmer. This is not the only Toro model that has this problem.Like most trimmers, as the line gets shorter, you bump the trimmer on the ground to feed more line. But, with the Toro trimmer, the line breaks too close to the spool. So, you constantly have to stop, take it apart and manually feed more line.Also, the bump process does not work very well. You have to bump the trimmer and hold it down for awhile to get the line to feed. It almost never works on grass. It does work if you bump it on concrete, but it leaves a black mark.The pity is that the Toro does a very good job of trimming. It just takes a long time to trim even a small area, because you are always having to take it apart to get more line."
1,"ditto, ditto","Right out of the box, this trimmer never worked right. The line either feed itself out within minutes of use or disappeared completely inside. I spent more time on my hands and knees trying to get the cord to work right than I did using the trimmer.Also, my heavy duty extension cord would fall out of the socket too easily---well, maybe just in time for each pause to deal with string.Definitely a flawed design. I had a Black and Decker before this that worked pretty well for a couple years- as a point of comparison."
1,Worthless,"I had the same problem with the nonfunctional string feed as the others. Additionally, the handle often came off. The handle is clipped onto the wand and is held in place by friction. There is no bolt to hold it securely in place. Finally, shield was coming loose because the plastic split in the place where it is attached to the motor.My previous trimmer was a Toro and it gave me many YEARS of service.When I first used this one, it was immediately apparent that it had a much less powerful motor than my old one. This model was much larger than my old one so I expected it to have a MORE powerful motor.Toro should reintroduce some of their old models that were designed to give service rather than conform to the latest fads in industrial design."
2,Not that Bad,"Most of the folks complaining are complaining about the feed feature. I would be willing to bet they have lost the inner spring and do not realize it. I know this because I have lost two already. It is not mounted in there and when you open the feeder cassette it pops out. When you are hot and tired, you may not notice, I didn't.Yes it has low power. You only paid $40 buck. You want power, get a gas trimmer! Or trim more often so that you aren't over working the poor motor.For the price it is a fair product."
2,It's Ok...,I am not all that impressed with this set. I will probably switch back to something else next time. I gave it a try bc it was cheaper but the only product in the entire set that I was even mildly pleased with was the Exfoliating Acne Treatment Gel. Other than that the rest of the set is lacking and did not seem to do much to prevent breakouts for me.
2,Annoying writing style,"This is my first time writing a book review; I am disappointed with this novel's writing and story-telling style. Every other sentence contains akward breaks and beginnings. The author's grammer is superfluous and non-varied. I am by no means an authority on writing, but this style just stuck out to me like a thorn. I guess the writing wouldn't have bothered me so much if the plot wasn't so boring. The book's premise promises to be a great thought-provoking story on society, cloning and the the relationships of the 3 main characters. The first half of the book is a VERY detailed, jumpy and slow reminiscence of their childhood. I was hoping for the characters to interact more with the outside world and to reflect how their lot in life is different from the non-cloned. Instead the book DWELLS on the love triangle and relationships of Ruth, Kathy and Tommy.I am sure others will find this book stimulating, but I couldn't even get myself to finish it."
2,IT WAS SO MISNAMED,"I was drawn into this book not only by the author's name but also by ""Remains of the Day"" which was so poignant. However, by page three or four I could not feel any empathy for Kathy and her wobbling little thoughts about her life in the ""institution"". I did carry on page after page, looking for the purpose of the book, waiting, waiting. I did understand, like chapters about 'the pencil case' and other little items were symbols but they lead nowhere. She kept promising us, 'but more about that later' and nothing happened and so finally I knew that nothing really was coming later. I suppose that if your purpose in life is to be a body parts donor then there cannot be any joy, yearnings, or creative love but it is not anything that the world wants to be told about because unfortunately that is the fate of millions of us, unknowingly. Remains of the Day, although it came to the same end was at least frought with repressed passion."
4,A Book to Make You Think,This is a fascinating story and I recommend it to readers who aren't afraid to think about where science may be taking us and how important ethics are when faced with new scientific possibilities. It's a good read but prepare yourself to be shocked when you find out what's going on.
4,A Subtle and Affecting Book,"Ishiguro never fails to surprise me. Each of this author's books seem a bit different, and they are never quick to disappear from my consciousness, even after long having closed the book.The book is narrated in the first person by Kathy H., a student (or inmate?) of the Hailsham School, which is an establishment that has enigmatic goals for its student body. One guesses early on why these children are special, and yet there is an overpowering tension as you read on, because the reader assumes there are further mysteries to be revealed. There are indeed events that we don't understand oompletely, but the resolution of these is a bit of a letdown--both for the reader, and the characters.Although it was not quite what I expected (I was expecting more traditional dystopian novel), and while I was frequently baffled by character reaction and motivation, I found myself deeply affected by this rather frighteningly plausible story."
2,Premise would have been much more powerful as a short story,"Have you ever known anyone who had some interesting stories to tell, but when telling their stories, talked on and on and on without getting to the point? That is what reading this book is like. The idea behind the novel is an interesting one, but the story unfolds at an excruciatingly painful pace. The characters are all unlikable and unsympathetic. The entire story is dreary and colorless, literally. And while I realize that this is a metaphor for the lives the characters lead, it makes for a very unenjoyable reading experience.I will say that the author has a way with words. I just think that a much shorter version of the story of their lives would have made a bigger inpact on the reader.(And for those who have read the book already, are we really supposed to believe that the two old ladies in that old house wield great power and control over the main characters and their companions?)"
1,A page-turner for the wrong reasons,"Being a writer myself, I have probably a different take on this book. I expected something different, having read the back cover and having seen Remains of the Day (the film). I have not read anything of Ishiguro's before, but I didn't like his style at all. I kept turning the pages because I wanted to see if I was missing something and, besides I was reading this for a reading group. I have to say, I found the style silly and pretentious. If I wanted to read a book with a Brave New World twist, I wouldn't have chosen this one."
2,The story is not on a par with the good writing,The total acceptance by the clones of their fate is not credible in the late 1990s. They are purported to be intelligent human beings and yet they never use their intelligence to question whether the purpose they serve is of any use or worth the sacrifice. The descriptive writing is admittedly clear and beautiful but the overall content left me unmoved.
2,Intriguing but unsatisfying,"The docility of the clones became more and more maddening as the book progressed. They aren't locked up, they know they are going to be cut up and killed in 4 steps, they look like a perfectly normal human being - they just bleat their way to the slaughter house. If not the victims, what about the rest of humanity? I'm just trying to imagine what kind of protests PETA would stage for human clones being slaughtered for spare body parts?A very intriguing premise but I really started to dislike the book. After finishing the book, I feel really let down - I would have appreciated more details. Dumb book."
1,What a disappointment...don't bother!,"The only thing that caused me to actually finish this book was that I HOPED that something exciting was just around the corner. Boy was I wrong!!Page after page after page I found myself feeling frustrated by the dialogue between characters, as well as wanting to edit out words entirely from each sentence. Although the topic of cloning is in itself an interesting idea for a book, this author tap danced around the issue with such a watery thin plot and characters that I felt like I had wasted my time by the end of the book. We get to the end of the story where Kathy and Tommy meet face to face with the women to ran Hailsham....and their conversation was so ridiculously wordy and stupid that I seriously chucked this book across my car. Huge waste of my time. I cannot understand the positive reviews of it at all."
3,"Great start, uninteresting finish","The first half of the novel was great, kept me guessing. I was dying to find out what the big secret was. Then we are told in a rather boring way, then the rest of the story was just a little flat. I don't think I would recommend this one."
3,Science fiction,"I call this book science fiction because the first page says, ""England, late 1990s,"" and what follows could not have happened in that place and time, but the tag is not necessarily an indictment. The question behind NEVER LET ME GO -- What is it that makes us human? -- is one that both science fiction and literature are capable of tackling, or fumbling. The problem here is that approaching the question from the viewpoint of Kathy H. (the narrator) and her ilk is just too easy. So you have a novel which is not particularly ambitious, or a science fiction story which is not particularly novel. It has been years, but I recall that Karel Capek's WAR WITH THE NEWTS was a much more effective use of this theme. That said, NEVER LET ME GO is creepy and compelling enough to provide a pleasant diversion."
2,"I didn't ""get it""...","If there is a deeper meaning intended for this novel, then it was lost on me. I found the storyline boring, unoriginal, and predictable, and not particularly well written. The story also lacked believability. I kept reading, hoping the book would improve, but was ultimately let down by a lackluster ending."
1,The Remains of Soylent Green -and Totally Overrated,"I found this novel slow and the characters infuriating. Why is everyone, especially Ruth, so unstable? It's like everyone has Borderline personalities. But the utter LACK of of any scientific explanation incorporated into the story suggests that people can be bred and trained to serve passively, and that's crazy. Even when little bits of their future are revealed explicitly by Miss Lucy, THERE ARE NO REACTIONS from the students. I found this unbelievable. I couldn't wait for a wrap-up and payoff, and when it finally happened (all too briefly and casually), I tossed the book as soon as I finsihed it.(Having read some spoiler reviews before reading my 1st Ishiguro novel, I may have damaged the experience... but I doubt it)"
1,SO BORING,"This book came highly recommended, and so I gave it every effort I could. If the authors uses the word ""daft"" again I think Ill shoot myself. The characters are SO boring, how can we possibly relate? My cable is broken, its 100 degrees out but I think I'll need to go to the book store and purchase something readable. His descriptions of so tedious yet at the same time lack any significance. I hated this book, if anyone wants it it will be in tomorrows trash."
2,Falls Flat,"This semi-Orwellian novel has a potentially gripping idea that could have been developed into a deeply resonant exploration of the triumph of spirit over the fraility of our bodily natures. But the novel becomes a bore, always soliciting the reader's sympathy but never earning it. The prose is flat, the characters unreachable, and the plot falls victim to the author's (no doubt brave) attempt to make it reflect the unfeeling system that has engineered the cruel world in which the action takes place. After the first few chapters, you've got all you are going to get from this book. There's little point in going on."
2,Boring,"Boring through the first 3/4, then boring AND aggravating in the last part. I won't say why it was so aggravating and be a *spoiler*...just take my word for it."
1,"Boring, tedious, poorly written","What a horrible waste of time. I suppose the premise is mildly interesting, but not more than that. And while it is technically well written, it really isn't; people just don't talk like that, and the human interactions are unrealistic, very shallow, and unconvincing. Character development is shallow.And this is the most tediously boring book ever. I kept with it because amidst all the [pretentious, in retrospect] praise I thought it would get better. But no. It is a complete waste of time. It is like reading 200 pages about paint drying.It gets one star from me but only because there is no zero star option."
3,. . .yet another,"In the spirit of J.K. Rowling, Ishiguro presents in this work an English boarding school with a very unexpected twist. He masterfully pulls the reader in and allows the story to unfold slowly, bit by bit. For me, the book touched upon so many themes: sexual mores, the plight of those who are born to lose, the bliss of childhood which is so often followed by the great disappointments of adult life. For all the ways in which they are remarkably different from us, the Hailsham students' lives are illustrative: they come into the world bright eyed, they soon learn that life is not what they had expected it to be, and they ultimately, and rather unflinchingly, face their unique fate. This is a sad, frightening and provocative tale which seems particularly well suited for conversion to a screenplay."
4,why don't the clones rebel?,"The likely answer is that the clones, in their passivity and resignation, are an allegory for the rest of us. In other words, this book isn't really about clones at all, but instead is an oblique commentary on the more conventional form of human existence--ours.Is our world really so bad, and so bleak? Well, no, it isn't. And in reality, would the clones rebel? Yes, at least some of them would. To this reader at least Ishiguro has committed a pretty basic literary sin: he has characters act in ways that are fundamentally unconvincing in order to make an at best partially accurate philosophical point.Never Let Me Go is still a good book in many ways, well-written and tender (or is it sentimental?) enough to suspend most disbelief, but what was Time magazine thinking? Sorry, but it's not one of the ten best novels of the decade."
5,One of the best books I have ever read. Masterpiece,"One of the few books in recent memory to be critically acclaimed (it was shortlisted for the Booker Prize) as well as genuinely interesting. All too often so-call literary 'works' are dreary collections of an author's attempt to win him/herself a prize.Never Let Me Go is breathtaking in its originality. And, even better, is the equisite style that the writer expresses the shocking future that has been dreamed up. If you enjoyed Margaret Atwoods 'Handmaids Tale' or 'Oryx & Crake' then this book is an absolute must have.Read it, give it to your friends, then sit back and be prepared to while away many happy hours in discussion about the ethical dilemnas posed within."
5,Not enough stars to rate it..,"It is such a beautiful, heart breaking, humane book. Using unbelievable imagination and extraordinary prose, author takes the reader deep into the minds and thoughts of cloned for purpose young people, exploring their spirits and souls. I will never let this book slip out of my memory."
5,Haunting,"I purchased this book in hardback when it first was released. Having read Ishiguro's other novels, I was eager to read his latest. This novel is nothing like anything he previously had written, and it is nothing like anything I have read ever before (and after). I finished the book uncertain as to whether or not I liked it; I even sold the hardback so that I could purchase another book. Well, I wish that I had kept the hardback because this story has stayed with me like none other. Images from the book run through my consciousness at random times, and the eerie, haunting, visceral feelings that I experienced when reading the book return as well. I hestitate to see the movie as the imagery in my imagination is so clear. These ""flashbacks"" are not negative experiences, they are a testament to the power of this book and the uniqueness of the story. I highly recommend this book; it shocked and enriched my imagination and was worth expending precious reading time more than any novel I have read."
4,Ishiguro's Best Book,"After the mess that was When We Were Orphans, it was a sheer delight to see that Ishiguro has returned to the level we first encountered in The Remains of The Day. The writing is deceptively simple and straightforward, but the tension is maintained throughout until the expected ending. Ishiguro uses the issue of clones and cloning to deal with his favourite subjects: the unreliability of memory, the past, regret."
2,Just ok for me,"I loved The Remains of the Day and so decided to read Ishiguro's other books. I was really rather disappointed. I expected and hoped for the subtle intricacies and fulfilling storytelling I got from The Remains of the Day, but didn't quite get it. Of course reading the story still left me with high regard for the author's imaginative and narrative abilities, but I felt disconnected to all of the characters and the story moved slowly for me. I will say this book is way better than Ishiguro's When we were Orphans, which I found almost ridiculous. Great writer, but I think he had it right with The Remains of the Day, not quite with this novel."
2,Boring,I thought this book drug on a long time with nothing much happening. No real suspense and I kept expecting the characters ro act human and fight for survival. Depressing.
3,A tiny idea: tedious exposition,"Oh dear.What a waste both of my time and the writer's undeniable talent. This is a perfect example of an idea that must have sounded wonderful over a cup of tea or a small drink, and which should have stopped at the literary magazine article size.It is not that it isn't a good idea - simply that it can't sustain 288 odd pages, of particularly inane drivel spouted by the protagonist. The novel simply exhausts your interest: written in a passive, minor key in the voice of someone who clearly finds time-tables a mental challenge. All very internally consistent - but OMG - its so hard to engage.And if you have managed to stay more than half awake, it is so full of plot-holes that is resembles a moth eaten old sweater.I really don't think I can give another donation - I am up for completion now.Sheesh!Nice prose though. Can't fault that - So ***.Good luck with the movie!"
3,Intelligent but not quite riveting,"""Never let me go"" has an interesting premise and is a well-written book. However Ishiguro fails to satisfy or even engage. Given the context, perhaps this was intentional. However, I came away feeling that Ishiguro could have made his point much more effectively in the form of an essay or even a short story. The book does get boring / tedious, and sometimes annoyingly so. To be fair, there are a few thought-provoking moments but all-in-all, fails to fulfil."
4,DO NOT READ REVIEWS OF THIS BOOK -- READ THE BOOK FIRST!!!,"Never Let Me Go is a very worthwhile book. But you must not read reviews of it before you read the book itself: AVOID SPOILERS!!! Let the plot unfold on you so that you don't know where it is going. Only then will you fully appreciate the subtlety and beauty of the plot development and the underlying message. It's a good read -- not Shakespeare or Flaubert, but almost Dickens or Hardy. Close to Balzac in quality. As you read it keep repeating to yourself: ""This is an English author, writing an English work of literature."" Some people don't get that Ishiguro, for all his Japanese name, is as Brit as they come, and he writes fully in the tradition of Hardy, Lawrence, Forster, and all those other English writers.Good read! Highly recommended."
3,To read or not to read,"I found this book oddly intriguing. There are the light-hearted crimes of the boarding school, broken hearts, odd alliances, and then, there is a very dark shadow, popping in and out of the story. Like the kids, the reader finds out the details in pieces, just enough so they are not horrified. Yet, the playful, relationship stories continue. I'm not sure I will recommend it to others to read, but I'm also certain I won't forget it."
4,Writing-4 stars. Science-stars,"The author, as usual does a splendid job of creating a world and filling it with wonderful characters.I, however, question the author's real understanding of science. By the late nineties there were alreadyexperiments happening which were aimed at eventually growing test tube organs. I had a very difficulttime putting that knowledge aside (suspending disbelief)."
3,Kept me reading,"I thought this was an interesting book and subject however I thought it was just ok. I kept expecting more to happen but it really never seemed to take off.I read this book fast because I just wanted to see what happened next. The author did a good job of keeping me interested and wanting to know more.But after I finished the book, I didn't feel very satisfied."
4,I am glad I have read this book,"I however doubt that I will ever reread it. I thought it was hunting and very beatiful prose, I never thought that tempo was slow or boring. I doubt that author wanted to create full blown alternate world, I think he used scifi as window dressing to ask questions of contemporary humanity, so underdeveloped settings, or I guess settings so similar to our world did not bother me, I kind of thought it was the point. I was not shocked that students did not try to escape their fate, and really want to remind of recent historical events to those who were shocked. I think if I were to judge this book on literary merit alone,I would give it a solid five, but I think that reviewer's emotional reaction should count at least a little bit as well - I ended up being in so very depressed mood that I am going to give it a four."
4,Couldn't put it down,"I had forgotten what it was like to be so engrossed in a book that I literally could not put it down. Kazuo Ishiguro's Never Let Me Go is that sort of book. I was so glad I didn't know anything about the novel going in, because it made it so much more interesting to watch the story unfold. Ishiguro's writing is beautiful and descriptive, and truly a joy to read.The movie, on the other hand, is terrible, and a huge disappointment after reading this beautiful book."
4,Never Let Me Go,"This is a compelling story about relationships. I got through it quickly and was sad when it ended.It does take a while to get going, and the story jumps around some, but I think that makes the narrative more authentic.There are underlying themes in the book which I would have liked to seen developed more."
3,"Interesting and thought provoking, but could have been so much better","So, I just finished reading this book about 5 minutes ago. Although I did enjoy it and it held my attention, I think that it could have been much better. Without giving any information away, I was really hoping to have many more of my questions answered at the climax point of the book, but it still keeps the reader very much in the dark. That is fine for some people and it does give the reader the ability to reflect and come to your own conclusions, however I was hoping to be more entertained by the author's answers that never came in the story. All in all, it was quite enjoyable and I will probably loan my copy on to a friend. It is by no means one of the best books that I have ever read, but it was a nice quick read (only 288 pages)."
2,boring....,"I so wanted to like this novel, but it was so slow and the ending was probably the best part."
3,Never Disappoint Me,"I was extremely disappointed by Ishiguro's new book. Never Let Me Go starts auspiciously with vague hints about an unsettling aspect to the narrator and her classmates' seemingly idyllic lives. Throughout the novel, the reader knows there's something not quite right. These hints kept me riveted and unable to turn away from the book; but Ishiguro reveals his hand too soon, telling the reader the truth about half way through the novel. However, the hints continue and lead the reader to believe there's more. There isn't. There is no surprising revelation at the end, no addition to the reader's knowledge. After reading this enthralling book in one sitting, I felt let down."
2,wrting poor,"It was a good theme/topic but poorly written, almost like he did not really know what he was writing about and starts with new sentences/ideas and then continue with a new idea. Also interesting that he writes from a female point of view. Too many questions at the end and you wonder what was the reason for the story?"
2,Revisiting Hitler,"Book reminds one of movie about efforts in south America to clone little Hitler's to ensure continuation of the master race. Supposedly motives were higher in this book, but end result is gruesome and terrifying.."
2,boring!,I thought this would be better. This was one of my daughter's assigned summer reading books. I often read along so that we can have discussions. I could not get into this book at all and abandoned it about half way in. It is too slow moving for my taste!
2,Could have been great as a short story,"Dahl or Poe would have loved the (darker) subject matter of this book for a short story. Unfortunately Ishiguro ruins it by adding page after page of pointless, banal high school anecdote. It seems as he was working on a ""Catcher in the Rye"" type of book, but it was too bland so he decided to add the subject matter of cloning and organ donors. Or the other way around, which would be even worst. Anyway, if you liked ""Remains of the day"" avoid this, or be very disappointed."
1,How to Transform a Great Premise into a Terrible Story,"What a premise! What an idea for a fantastic science-fiction novel! What a terrible story that was written. Instead of focusing on the premise of the story (cloning, morality issues, lack of family, lack of history, the crimes against humanity), Ishiguro focuses on the boring, childish, and uninteresting lives of school children, barely touching upon the premise of the book until more than two-thirds the way through. This was not touching, or intresting, and it really should have been. Ishiguro tried to ring it all in at the end, piling up the ""moving"" elements of the story, but it was too little to late. Furthermore, he relied upon ridiculous exposition to fill us readers in on how this alternate world came to be. I was equally disappointed with Ishiguro's ""When We Were Orphans."" This is my last book of his. Read at your own risk."
3,"Well Written, Unsure if I recommend it","I'm surprised by all of the 5 star reviews on here. Never Let Me Go is by no means a bad book. It's well written. But, overall, it's rather flat. The characters aren't deep enough to make up for the lack of a rich plot. There is only one overall plot element that keeps you reading (which I will not mention here), and it is assumable by the reader early in the book. I only kept reading in case there was some unexpected payoff at the end and/or something I hadn't foreseen.Edit: The odd thing about this book, is that it sticks with you. I enjoy the memory of the book more than the experience of reading it. So I'm left unsure of whether to recommend it or not. My overall feeling, after having let the book sit in my mind for a while, is that it is a beautiful, haunting portrait that would have been better as a short story or a novella."
2,Not an enjoyable read - for reasons both good and bad.,"On the positive side - the sense of dread starts on page one and doesn't let up. Reading this novel is similar to reading Atwood's ""The Handmaid's Tale"" - you can't put it down, but you feel despair the whole time you're reading it. This is no small accomplishment and I credit Ishiguro with his ability to write something so compelling.On the negative side - also like the Handmaid's Tale, this novel is agenda-driven, and like most novels with an agenda, the characters are just pawns, not seeming to breathe with a life of their own. Ishiguro seems to have made a specialty out of creating the emotionless, repressed character, and receives a lot of admiration for this, but given the situation the narrator finds herself in, it's pretty unsatisfying that she spends the entire novel reasoning her way through it and observing others' emotional moments, not expressing any feeling of her own beyond irritation or mild pleasure."
5,This book left me thinking for hours after!,"This is one of the best books that I've ever read. Thought provoking and somewhat disturbing. I really couldn't stop thinking about it long after I'd finished. The book deals with three children that grow-up in the knowledge that they will have to donate their organs to other humans that are sick and in need of them. It's only as they grow into adults that the realisation of this really hits them and the consequenes that it will have on them. The writer has a real ablity of geting you to care about Kathy, Ruth and Tommy and the ending left me speechless. It has really made me think about organ donation, the worl we live in now and a world that could be. Mind blowing!"
4,A book that leaves you to ponder,"This book left me feeling a little unsettled. To be honest I found the story at times a little flat, but the snippets of information revealing the truth about the boarding school 'Hailsham' kept me inspired to keep reading. The scenario as it unfolds puts a 'human' perspective on the ethics of genetic science and raises questions on the implications of its use; all within the story without standing on a high horse and lecturing. Overall a well written book."
1,Let me spare you the agony,"While you'd think that the topic of cloning could provide an author with endless fodder for interesting and compelling writing, Ishiguro succeeded in making cloning the most boring topic known to man. The author inserts all of these obscure references and tid-bits that are supposed to intrigue the reader. All fall flat and had me saying: ""You have got to be kidding me."" The first-person narration is repetitive, one-dimensional, and as dull as can be. Neither the narrator nor the main characters has an ounce of depth. Furthermore, the ""mysteries"" are revealed in the very last pages of the book. The revelations are even more boring than the book itself. What a waste. This author took a potentially fascinating topic and turned it into a dreadfully uneventful account of the lives of faceless students living at a lifeless, cardboard boarding school. Do not waste your time."
2,Disappointing,"I found the premise of this book interesting. The lives of clones raised to donate their organs to normal people. The book should have been much more interesting than it was. I kept waiting for something to happen. For some rebellion or some sort of change in their fates. It never came. The clones, or students as they're called, accept their fates and make no bold attempts to run away or to fight the system beyond simply asking if they can defer their ""donations"". The book bored me, but I kept reading, expecting it to get more interesting. It did not."
2,Too much psychological introspection,"I listened to the whole thing on CDs in my car. If I had been reading, I would not have finished it. Mostly psychological introspection that goes on and on and on. Too slow."
3,Not for me...,"I tried reading this book and quickly discovered it fell into the ""not for me"" column. I like about 60-70% of every book category that's out there, but sometimes I end up buying one that I simply can't finish.This was one of them. It just didn't grab me. I can't really review it because I couldn't force myself beyond a chapter or so. I figure a 3 star rating is sort of on the average end of things and I don't want to completely bash a book that was simply not interesting enough for me to finish.If you're not sure... check it out at a library, get a feel for it before you buy!"
3,Interesting idea in book but BORING.,I simply did not connect with the way this book was written. Sorry about that.
2,Don't Bother,"I should begin this review by saying I have never been so disappointed by a book that I felt compelled to save my fellow readers from the same waste if time. The premise of this book is promising and even a bit intriguing. However, the ""secret"" becomes fairly obvious almost right away. I kept waiting for a twist in the story, but it never came.All in all, if you're looking for an escape or a page-turner, this is not the book for you."
2,Not worth it,"By the second chapter I was wondering how The Sunday Times could have called this ""The year's most remarkable novel"", unless this was faint praise and the publisher's had pulled the phrase out of context. By the third chapter the premise of the book was obvious and I kept thinking it might get better. It didn't ... the characters just seem to meander along in an aimless daze letting their fate arrive. I didn't bother to finish the book - I have better things to do."
2,Yaaawwnnn.,What a complete waist of time and money. Not even going to bother watching the movie! I have never been so bored in my life!
2,Not Impressed,"While the narrative was well-written, the plot itself was bland. Several of my friends had told me what a great this book this is, so I had high expectations. Ultimately, it was a let-down and lacks imagination."
2,Disappointing,"I had high expectations for this book, and unfortunately, this book did not deliver. The concept of the book was good, but I found that it left me with more questions then it answered, and I was always confused. He jumps right into the book, not explaining anything. Sorry to say, this book was no good."
2,Adding review for hardcover edition,"I reviewed this book elsewhere, but I had to add this here: This typeface was the most hideous typeface ever used for a novel. The ""a""s all looked like ""o""s and it took 20 pages for my brain to convert them. If I were Queen of the Universe, this typeface would actually be outlawed."
3,Hmmmmmmm?,"We purchased this book as it was a selection for our monthly book club, and were unable to get it from the library long enough to finish reading it. It is elegantly, somewhat languidly written. I found the typeface difficult, as ""a"" and ""o"" are confusingly similar in their forms.I knew by about page 20 or so where the book was going, having been introduced to the theme in many science fiction stories I've read over the years. The exposition appeared to drag; it was almost as though the author were attempting to tease the reader by the slow pace of exposition.The treatment of several fundamental issues of life (e.g., the educability of children to participate willingly in their self-destruction and the ease of categorizing people and things as not self-aware) might have been treated with greater clarity.All in all, this seems to me to have enough material for a good short story, and to have been expanded to fill the pages of a book."
3,"Not quite up to the hype, I thought","First, I agree with many other reviews that this is a beautifully written book. Kathy's narration is enjoyable and the book is a very ""easy"" read--which I mean as a compliment.But, I also have to agree with other reviewers that the story here is missing some things. Why, upon being released into greater society, don't some of the ""students"" just run away. Do they have a chip in their heads or something? Not to be flip, but this was a big hole in the story that I thought made the book a lot less satisfying. Why would Kathy want to be such friends with Ruth? She was really pretty awful.All in all, I did enjoy this book, but I can't say I understand quite why it inspired the sort of hype it did."
3,Disappointing,"Based on the reviews I have read I am in the minority, but I did not like this book at all. The novel was well written, however not very entertaining. Although the concept the book is based around is interesting, it felt like chore to read the book. The characters felt emotionally underdeveloped, and yes I understand that is kind of the point, and yet I was left wanting. I was left grasping for a reason to care whether they were used up or not, in the end they fell flat and therefore their predicament was not as desperate as it could have been. I try to not to pick apart books too much, heck I probably wouldn't be able to if I tried, so simply put this book was just plain boring and unmoving."
4,A Clone is a Clone is a Clone,"What exactly does it mean to be a duplicate of another living being? Do clones have souls? Is your life a lie or does it lie something deeper? What happens when you only have questions, and not enough direction for answers?These are the types of quandaries set up by Mr. Ishiguro's short, but powerful, science fiction novel for those that don't like science fiction. It has it's faults, sure, but the strength of his literary convictions far surpasses the thin plot and lack of memorable supporting cast."
1,Gave it a Try,"I've learned long ago that it is OKAY to leave a book without finishing it. Of course the book is well-written, but who cares? I had to put it down and chalk up the $12 as a loss."
2,Surprised,"I was surprised to read all the favorable reviews of this novel. The writing is dull and suffers from so much understatement that the characters do not come alive. After I figured out the situation early on,the rest of the story limped to its flat ending. Actually the style seemed to match that of a Young Adult novel. Even though her subject is not specifically the same, Jodi Picoult's My Sister's Keeper is much better at character development, style, and plot;and it delves deeply into a similar controversial topic."
2,A slow paced book,"Maybe I should have gathered this, but the narrator's voice is British which through me off at first for a bit. Took a little while to get used to. Also, in general, the book moves fairly slowly. The author throws in some foreshadowing but takes too long to get to those more interesting parts of the book. Some intriguing issues to think about arise, but I would have liked the book to move along faster."
1,"the evil of banality, redux","Want to read an excruciatingly dull book full of boring, petty characters whose sole desire is to return to a sterotype of a British public school? Here ya go.Not to mention, every major plot device in this book can be predicted chapters in advance by any half-competent SF devotee. (And that every major plot turning has been scrupulously signposted with a billboard for the presumably ignorant reader.)The only evils of this book that haven't been hashed and rehashed are: 1) the fact that you're going to spend $25 to come away completely unenlightened about anything that matters; and 2) that the leading literary lights consider this to be a work of the highest caliber.If you want to read about the banality of evil in an engrossing and rich book, go read Michel Faber's ""Under the Skin""."
4,A question,I enjoying the book I cannot stop reading it. One kind of silly question what was the difference between a carer and a doner?
2,The Island or Never Let Me Go???,"I usually adore Ishiguro's work but this one falls short of the mark. I still enjoyed the writing but the story didn't deliver. Like other reviewers said, it was too similar to the sci-fi movie ""The Island"". Furthermore, there was a build-up as if some big secret was going to be revealed and nothing came of it. I will still keep on reading his novels because I love his style."
2,Well written but gruesome,"Give this 5 stars for being well written but negative 5 stars for leading the reader into what is thought to be old school freinds reminiscing and turns out to be a ghoulish story about cloned children that are raised to be harvested for body parts for transplant. After 4 ""donations"" they ""complete"". I couldn't put it down, but also wanted it to be over and wished I'd never read it. Read this only if you are interested in this gruesome theme! Maybe I'm missing the deeper theme...."
3,Read at Your Own Risk,"Great book, if you enjoy getting to know a lovely group of children that remind you of yourself and even your own kids, experiencing their utter abandonment, lonliness and grief, and eventually their slow, exausting and painful deaths at the prime of their lives. If this scenario disturbs you, do not read this book. Though this book is well written and compelling, raising children for the purposes of organ donation is so blatantly immoral and sad that there is really no insight to be gained for anyone with an ounce of compassion. This book belongs in the horror genre."
3,"Skilled writer, but leaves me cold","This one is clearly a well-crafted book- the story is thight and the characters are well described and realistic within their strange and tiny world. In the words of comic artist Dan Clowes, however, the book maintains an icy distance between artist and reader. Not bad of itself,i was in the mood for a waarmer read."
2,What a disappointment!,"I was so very disappointed by this book. I found the language stilted and the dialog terribly childish and stiff. I had the ""secret"" figured out after the first 10 pages and the ending was a complete anti-climax."
2,the short of it,I'll keep this short. Never Let Me Go: Great premise; unlikeable characters involved in pointless melodrama; boring read; not much really happens. Disappointing.
4,"The book, overall, was enjoyable.","It was hard not to compare Never Let Me Go to Kazuo Ishiguro's prior writings. I found myself comparing the story to Margaret Atwood's Handmaid's Tale as I turned the pages; which is not a bad thing.Kazuo Ishiguro's writing is direct, a young woman remembering her days in an English Boarding school for [special] children.The part about this this book that I enjoyed the most was that fact that you are listening to Kath H. tell her story, how she remembers it, growing up at school, her relationships with her friends and teachers (Guardians), especially her friendship with Ruth and Tommy. She tells her entire life at Haisham and beyond.The overall book was enjoyable, the ending wrapped up a little to quickly, but overall a great book and a decently quick read."
2,Grave Disappointment,This novel offers little more than a nice thread of suspense throughout. I didn't find Ishiguro's book to offer any more insights than a mediocre mass market novel would. The lack of complexity is astounding.
3,Not Really a Story About Cloning,"Although I believe this was a well written novel, it was not what I expected. If you want to read a good book about the moral issues of cloning, read ""The House of the Scorpion"" by Nancy Farmer. It is a Newbery Honor book for young adults but I think if your interested in the topic of cloning you will soon see the impact it can have even on adults. It is one of my favorites. I was hoping to find a book along those lines. Unfortunately, this was not it."
2,Why Didn't They Run Away?,"I admire Kazuo Ishiguro for never ""talking down"" to his readers; he assumes you've got some intelligence and doesn't over-describe or over-explain. The reader figures things out for him/her self as the story unfolds. But I couldn't help wondering why NONE of the characters ever consider running away, and why Ishiguro chose to set the story in modern times when setting it a little in the future would have made more sense.For two other (better, IMO) books about dystopic societies try: Margaret Atwood's, ""Oryx and Crake"" and P.D. James', ""The Children of Men""."
3,Illiterate Author,"A fun read with a happy ending. The illiterate author does suffer from a few errors in grammar and some miss-used words that detract from the reading, but overall it was a fun little book. Many people miss the point that these clones are missing something; they are not quite right. The author makes them emotionally flat and incapable of deep thought for a reason -- so the reader (hopefully) realizes that their soulless lives are without worth. By the end, the reader not only accepts their demise, you actually root for it. Sort of like the primitive aliens in Avatar, you just want to see them die a horrible death."
3,Beautiful but thin,"I am a big fan of ""Remains of the Day"" and the ""unreliable narrator"" technique in general. I wasn't expecting actual science-fiction or literal-minded plot devices like rebellions or escapes, once I accepted Ishiguro's subtly-delineated alternate reality. However, I did hope for more payoff after enduring the tedium of the characters' adolescent tribulations and the very unlikable Ruth's machinations. I realized that this focus on the banal was intended to highlight how completely human these clones were, but it was rather difficult to slog through for hundreds of pages, and prevented me from caring about these people very much."
4,well written,"I loved the author's way of writing- very poetic. I was able to place myself into the story very easily.. however, I did not care for the plot very much. Much of it was confusing and kept my mind curious, pushing me through the book very quickly, hoping to find the answers to some of my question... which were answered- to a point. Not a big fan of scifi things mixed into stories that read like a true memoir. It just wasn't of the nature I usually go after and I especially didn't care for the ending. I don't want to tell anything away but I don't like the way Kathy H. parted with Tommy. If it wasn't for the magnificent writing of the author I would have given it 2 stars. I will be sure to check out another of his works."
4,Haunting,"That's the word that keeps resonating in my head upon finishing this book. Ishiguro's slow winding first person narrative unfolds like a flower to reveal a disturbing core. It's no secret that the book deals with clones raised for organ harvesting, but what was upsetting, to me anyway, is the characters calm acceptance of this predetermined fate. Done in an unsettling and haunting voice that is characterized by calm observation, Kathy was someone by the end I just wanted to embrace and save from an unimaginable fate. A book that stays with you long after you've turned the last page."
2,Bleh...,Not interesting if you ask me. Premise is pretty good but the writer took it nowhere. I was loathed to finish it but I did. Not a fan.
3,Interesting idea,"Hmmm- well I both liked & didn't like this book. I found the writing to be what compelled me onward most of the time- it's exceptionally well-written & easy to read. I've heard some people say that there's this great ""mystery that unfolds"" as you read it & I just didn't find that- maybe because I'd read some reviews ahead of time, but I also felt very early on that even without that, it was quite easy to figure out where the book itself was heading. If you don't already know the premise of the book, I won't spoil it for you here. What I didn't like about the book was the lack of emotion regarding the events in the book- I kept waiting for one of the main characters to actually seem to care what was happening to them & that really never seemed to happen. Perhaps that was entirely the point, but it disappointed me. Still- it was an interesting perspective science gone askew."
5,Fantastic,"I read Remains of the Day in high school and I absolutely loved it, so I was very excited to read this book. I hadn't read what it was about because I didn't want to spoil it, so I won't say what it's about here. It's an altogether different story than Remains of the Day, but the same superb, Ishiguro writing style. I highly recommend this book! It's a page turner that'll keep you hooked to the end."
2,What a dissapointment!,"I was expecting a science related horror story. Instead, it was a boring story of a ""doner"" facing the end of her meaningless life reminiscing about her childhood friendships - which wasn't all that interesting. Other than that, nothing happened. I kept reading, hoping for something to happen; a revolt, a twist, or any kind of action. But no, it just ended uninteresting, and unfullfiling.Maybe if she had fought for her rights or even questioned it, I would have cared about what happened to her. But if she didn't care, then why as a reader should I?*Possible Spoiler*The author must have agreed that clones would not have souls because even after hearing their whole life story, I had no feelings for the characters or cared that they had completed."
4,My Cup of Tea...,",,,this genre is not, but as usual with Ishiguro, the writing is spellbinding and he takes your hand and leads you through a dazzling journey, a magical mystery tour, if you will. You can't help but like this book. I coudn't put it down."
2,Let go already!,"First the good news. The book is written with great skill and parts of it are very beautiful and touching. The bad news is there is not enough here for a novel. It has the feel of a short story that has been stretched out beyond its own life. Under-whelming to say the least. The whole idea of cloning and its possible results, good or bad, are barely touched in the nearly 300 pages. In the end it is abook about many details that I didn't care about."
3,"Beautiful writing, but...","I really wanted to like this book, but when I kept waiting for something that never happened, it got to be a bit of a letdown."
2,Ok read - not great though,"I found the writer's style to be a bit off putting at times, but the plot was interesting and a bit different. Not a bad read for a once off, but I wouldn't recommend for someone looking for a light fun read."
3,creepy future world,"I read this because my reader's group is going to discuss it. I could not put it down until it was finished. It has a sinister mystery all through that is not revealed until almost the end. Then it gives a feeling of repulsion and horror. It was well written and clever. The author knows how to keep you reading and it has a unique style. It is intriguing, but it seem to reveal a god-less world where logic and not heart rules. If I look back over my experience of this book, I would say that it did not contribute anything morally or emotionally. It really left me with an sad, empty feeling. This is now how I want to feel. I will not go to the discussion group as I would rather not remember this book's thesis."
2,"More crude than Life of PI, but no pathos","Simply inhumane, maybe well written prose, but the cynicism is unbearable. It is an exercise in telling an awfully cruel story in the most subdued tone. Literature can and should be enjoyable, this is Hannibal the Cannibal trying to be intellectual."
1,This Novel Is a Let Down,"I purchased this book at the recommendation of an avid reader and librarian. I enjoy both literary works and nonfiction that address difficult social issues and had great expectations for this work. Although I did not know the exact subject of the book in the beginning, it became clear. I assume there are spoilers in the reviews, but I won't provide details other than to say the writer lacked artistic talent to reach any real climax or resolve potential character arcs. I finished reading this book some time prior to the film adaptation which was considerably worse than the book. My advice is to invest your time in other literature. This was a slow and boring read and a let down."
4,Heart wrenching!!,"This book is so much better than the movie. If you liked the movie, you HAVE to read the book. It will make you laugh, cry, and wonder...what if?"
4,"Not what I usually like, and yet I enjoyed it","This is one of those books where if you say anything at all, you'll likely ruin it for others.A thirty-something woman looks back on her early life. Vague enough?Even though this book is only a few years old, it already feels very dated--the concerns / issues it raises seem ... well, implausible, and they pale in relation to the real stuff going on in the world right now.Nevertheless, extremely enjoyable and interesting."
1,Can't help but let this one go,"Overall, Never Let Me Go by Kazuo Ishiguro is a book about clones who grow up for the sole purpose of providing organ donors. On paper this sounds like a great idea, but in reality this book is garbage. It is poorly written and sounds more like a girl's diary than the well-written novel that my school has made it out to be. The character is scatter-brained; she'll be talking about her friend, and somehow it will remind her of another time in which something entirely different happened, and then that reminder will remind her of another thing, and so on. Never Let Me Go is poorly written, and if you can avoid reading it, I recommend doing so."
1,Very Disappointing,"I was very much looking forward to reading this book, so I was very disappointed in the novel. I found the characters flat and the story predictable. It amazes me that it was nominated for a Man Booker Prize. Every year, I read the winner of this prestigious award, as well as most of the short-listed books. Although some of the books are not as interesting to me as others, they are at least well-crafted and beautifully written. I cannot imagine why this book was chosen. If Ishiguro was trying to be bland in order to mirror the lives of the characters, it was a stylistic mistake."
2,Wasn't expecting science fiction,"After the incredible Remains of the Day, I was expecting a lot from this book bythe same author. I wasn't expecting science fiction. Don't get me wrong - I love fantasy books, it's just not what I was looking for here. Remains of the Day was one of those books that made you look at the world and your own life a little differently. Never Let Me Go strived for the same levels of emotion, but it did this based on fake science fiction fantasies.*SPOILERS*----Cloned humans don't have rights, and aren't viewed as real humans - how sad.----Maybe his next book will be an emotional tale about how the Zoinkers from Planet Zebes struggle to become accepted as Argopans."
1,"poorly written, extremely boring","THoguht the book was poorly written, extremely boring. At the end of the story, the author tried to address the unanswered questions in such a junvenile way via some long winded conversation.couldn't understand why people call this a master piece, to me there was nothing master about it. I wonder whether i read the same book. Even the whole story is flawed, lack real logic. Why don't they fight for their own fate, since they have all the capabilities of thinking, acting like human, and the freedom to move around. They also don't want to go through the donation process (ie. ask for extensions). Seems quite silly.anyhow, thought it was a waste of my time."
2,Just bad writing,"The structure was awful, he digresses and goes off on tangents and backtracks. The male characters are all dopey pushovers while the female characters combine self-centered with anything from a grab bag of personality flaws. The main character Kathy is self-centered and condescending. Ruth is self-centered and two-faced.The sci-fi theme is played out and takes away from the attempt at story. Though it looks like the author chose to completely forgo a plot and instead tried to create atmosphere. Any sense of foreboding or consequences is destroyed page one by knowing that everyone survives and they repair their relationships.Very disappointing."
1,Ishiguro strikes out again,I liked Remains of the Day and I've been waiting for something readable from Ishiguro since then. His new book is not nearly up to the standard he set with Remains of the Day. It doesn't seem like he is acquiring any life experiences from which to draw on for his stories; but his stories are so unimaginative and unexplanatory that they are frightfully dull. It's hard for me to believe that publishers keep publishing his books. My advice on this one: don't even pick it up.
1,wouldn't buy from here again,"The book that I purchased was supposed to be in new condition and it was far from it. It had some gunk all over the wrinkled cover and the inside of the first few pages. It was obviously a well used book that someone had spilt over, I could have intentionally bought one like that for $5."
1,yawn,"I am an avid reader of fiction and was very disappointed with this book. Like several of the other commenters, I found it to be extremely tedious and well beyond the pale as far as believability. If there was some profound message here, it could have been communicated in a much, MUCH shorter story. Also like other readers, I kept expecting the pace/plot to pick up and it just never did. I was annoyed that I stuck with it to the bitter end. I guess the reader was supposed to be drawn in by the excruciating minutae of the relationships in the story but I found myself to be just...bored. As far as what I gather to be the profound ""message"" of reminding us to remember the humanity of our fellow man, well I found that to be just plain condescending."
3,MIXED FEELINGS,"I am somewhat conflicted about this book.The concept is original. The denouement moving. As always, Ishiguro's writing is transparent and consistently nuanced. But, I struggled with the earlier pages of which there are too many.In an effort to set the stage, he overwrites the petty thoughts and interactions of the children. The reader is aware of the clues and hints of what is to come; it is inevitable. Cloning and donation of organs quickly spring to mind. But, he drags it out to the point of exasperation. "" Get on with it "" was my reaction.When the story finally emerges it is heart wrenching and tear inducing. The metaphor can be taken at several levels; all of which are valid. The author is a thinker and philosopher. I admire that; but, this time ( in my opinion ) I had to work too hard to get there. Perhaps, a 150 page novella would have done the trick."
2,No emotion,This is one of those books where you like the idea of the book but not the book itself. This book didn't really make me feel anything. I never got so that I cared about the characters. I never came to feel that the characters cared about each other either. This is one of the books that you know you read but you just can't really remember later on. I wouldn't recommend this.
1,Let it go,"I picked up ""Never Let Me Go"" expecting, if not something of the caliber of ""The Remains of the Day"", then at least a good read. Boy, was I in for a disappointment. Despite its moral implications and what it's trying to say about cloning, ""Never Let Me Go"" flunks on a purely literary level. Its prose is basic to the point of seeming neutered, as if metaphors and evocative descriptions were poison. Its narrative devices are cloying and repetitive: seemingly random anecdotes that seem trivial at first. And then stay unredeemed until the end. Its characters are unlikable, difficult to penetrate, but more importantly: they're the epitome of boring.I usually read a book a week. ""Never Let Me Go"" took me a month. A month! I'd read three pages and doze off. I only finished it because Ishiguro is the author of a certain story about an English butler.Skip. Toss. Hide. Let go. Believe me."
5,This book didn't let me go for almost a year after I read it.,"Like an onion, the layers of this subtly written book peel off slowly. One gradually becomes aware of the underlying issue, which comes as a surprise rather than a shock because of gentle hints- watch for the pencil case early on- which help put pieces of the puzzle together without the realization of the reader. It's also a love story. With many twists!And only one character- a rather minor but vital one- has a first and last name."
4,beautifully lyrical overall,"A beautifully lyrical piece, deceptively simple prose. Part of the resolution feels a bit forced though; the story would have been better without it. The final few pages, however, help to correct part of this mistake and continues the generally sweet, sad tone of the inevitably of departure.An important commentary on what could plausibly become a major social issue from modern cloning technology."
2,Depressing -,"""Never Let Me Go"" was recommended to me as a new kind of science fiction movie. However good the actors were the story is just depressing, sort of an eerie George Orwell tale. It is filmed in a cold and windy England, and the children are beautiful but destined for a sad and short future. I understand no one wants to die, but this was just morbid and sickening to watch. Without giving away too much of the plot, you keep hoping that the stars have a normal life, but it is not to be. People in the theatre just sat stunned after the ending, looking at each other and shrugging shoulders. I don't know why it has such high ratings, the script is obtuse and drags on for a less than stellar revelation about life - there is never enough time.I give all the actors credit to make this picture a hit, but for me it was boring and sad."
5,I can't stop thinking about this book,Never Let Me Go was one of the most troubling and thought-provoking books I have read in a very long time. If you've read any of the reviews then you're already familiar with the subject matter - the story of the relationship between three school friends who share a sad and mysterious past and a bleak future. Kazuo Ishiguro has created a world for his characters that is revealed through small details and seemingly mundane experiences. As the reader begins to understand the true horror of what is happening to these characters it's impossible to look away because one is already so invested.At the heart of this story is the issue of bioethics and where we must draw the line. Is it possible that we could one day live in a world where this is possible? I hope not.
2,An exercise in blandness,"I had a difficult time finishing this book but forced myself--hoping that something would finally happen. Sadly, it didn't. The plot went nowhere (pages were devoted to minutiae such as a lost cassette tape and a controversy involving a pencil case ... zzzz). Further, the characters were extremely bland and spent very little time in serious self-examination.I kept hoping for some sort of epiphany that would move the ""students"" to rebel and do something to change their fate. Instead, the story just sort of trickled to an end. I can't recommend this one."
2,"Nice try, doesn't work","Two stars might be a bit harsh for this novel, but then again Ishiguro isn't some first time author so I penalize him a little more. I agree with the reader who said this should have been a novella unless Ishiguro could have come up with something more substantial for a plot. He creates a nice air of menace hovering in the background, but the day to day lives of the characters simply aren't interesting enough to sustain the first half of the book. I've noticed something interesting about many of the five star reviews--they seem to be reviewing the book's criticism of runaway technology without moral guidelines instead of the book itself. They're not wrong necessarily, but if a book is boring I'm not going to enjoy it no matter how much I agree with it's main point. Some people read for other reasons I suppose."
4,Novel or Relationships- great summer read,"I just finished this book yesterday. I must say while I was reading it I didn't want to put it down and once I did I just kept thinking about it. I don't think that it is an earth-shattering novel about the politics of cloning. However, I do think it is an earth-shattering novel about people and relationships. It's characters are so profoundly written, that one feels as though they live and breathe with them. I enjoyed this aspect a great deal. It is slow about two fourths of the way through, but the characters keep you reading. I didn't think the end was shocking or awfully meaningful, but Ishiguro certainly does ""pull you under."" Great summer read!"
1,Interesting topic but a terrible read,"Just awful. I nearly put down the book after 200 pages but pressed on in hopes there'd be something at the end, nothing. I simply cannot believe the great reviews this book has received.The basic story is very thought provoking. Unfortunately none of my thoughts were even remotely played out in the story. How about this, would there be some little shred of Kathy mind that night think, ""...hey, you know, this doesn't seem fair..."" or ""...what would happen if I chose not to donate..."". Instead we get all these memories about Tommy's favorite polo shirt; or my personal favorite, Ruth's fleeting memory about the shortcut through the rhubarb patch. Just sad.Interesting topic/terrible read. I seldom pen reviews but had to in this case."
1,Really Depressing,"Not worth reading at all! Very depressing and not a lot to the plot itself. I would recommend The Unit by Ninni Holmqvist, which has a similar structure to the society, just a more interesting plot."
1,Avoid it,"This is nowhere near as good of a story as ""The Remains of the Day"" (by the same author). It has a similar style and voice, except that the story is odd, disturbing, boring, and tedious. Not recommended"
1,Boring beyond belief ....,"I normally don't bother to review books that aren't good but feel a need to warn readers - who like their literary rides to be eventful - to avoid this book like the plague. Indeed, reading it (or endeavouring to do so in the desperate hope of discovering some redemption along the way) was like watching paint dry."
1,Anti-Climatic,"I bought this book hoping to be pleasantly surprised and three days later I returned it.I found 2 of the 3 main characters to be uninteresting and quite annoying and I thought the entire plot was very weak and dragged on way too long.Overall, it was one of the most disappointing books I've read in a long time."
3,Handle With Care,"When you read the book description on the back of the book; it sounds as if this book is pretty harmless; 3 students in a boarding school in the English countryside learning about how special they are. While it said: To learn how special they are..."" is pretty open ended, it didn't prepare for what was about to come.I found this book to be depressing. I felt that in the end, life was not something that was valued. The read is told things about being students, donations, being creative, and about art galleries; however never given what these things actually mean to the characters until the end; when it all comes crumbling down.I thought about not finishing this book, but while it is a bit on the disturbing side; its also something that once you start, you must finish."
2,The Religious Right's Nightmare Vision,"Ishiguro is a wonderful writer and ""Remains of the Day"" is one of my favorite books. That's one of the reasons that I was so disappointed in this book. The writing is beautiful but the plot is beyond outlandish. Unfortunately, it's impossible to discuss the problems in the narrative without spoiling the plot twists for any future reader. Suffice it to say that if the Vatican, Protestant fundamentalists and conservative Republics start a campaign to ban all medical research, this book will be high on their recommended reading list. Ethics in science and medicine is a very serious topic and any number of fictional works, probably beginning with Frankenstein, have treated that topic more even-handedly than this alarmist, one-sided vision of the future."
3,"Well written, somewhat disappointing","Besed on a interesting conceptual premise, this is a beautifully written work, almost poetic in tone. However it can be a trifle sluggish at times,and at the end, I felt that so much more could have been done with the story. I recommend it more for the original concept and quality of the writing than the depth of the plot. This could have been a modern classic, but does fall short. Will probaby make a beautiful movie, perhaps in the tone of Picnic at Hanging Rock."
3,Ehhh...just okay.....,"The book was by no means bad, but not something I wld ever recommend. I just kept reading so I cld get to the end. And then I did it and was as uneventful as the rest of the book."
4,Worth carrying on,"I read this book expecting it to be a bit more of a science fiction novel than it was, but that didn't hinder my enjoyment of the book at all. Kazuo is an excellent writer, and it really shows in his work here. It is a very touching story, but also a very frustrating one (it is intended to be by the author). This book will make you think. The characters are vivid, though not excessively drawn, which is wonderful. He doesn't give heavy details of people's appearances so that you can use your imagination. The tale is mysterious enough to keep you going, but it gets much more intriguing toward the third quarter of the novel. Get past the first half, it's worth it. I would read another one of his books."
5,"A Beautiful, Haunting Masterpiece","Science Fiction is normally not my preferred genre, but I was given this book as a gift so I decided to give it a try. I'm so glad I did, because the story is as beautifully written as it is eerie. Ishiguro creates a series of characters who suffer through the trials and tribulations of coming of age, while at the same time remaining prisoners to their own fate. The prose is written entirely from the point of view of Kathy, the main character, and allows the reader to delve inside of her memories and grow up with her. Although quite a few questions are left unanswered, I believe that Ishiguro is deliberately vague, and that this does not detract from the powerful tone of the book. If you're now sufficiently curious, definitely buy this novel - you won't regret it!"
3,Strange but captivating,"Never Let Me Go follows the narrator Kathy and her friends Tommy and Ruth through their youth in an English boarding school to their stay as young adults in a sort of wooded commune to their ultimate reunion as adults. Sound strange? This book is!Though their lives at the boarding school are sheltered, the three children and the reader receive subtle clues that all is not well. I don't want to spoil anything, so suffice it to say that Never Let Me Go is a strange mix of sci-fi, social commentary, and a coming of age story.This may not be an enjoyable read, but it is certainly a unique one."
4,Will stay with you for days,"Haunting, yet devoid of gratuitous gruesomeness one would expect given the subject matter. Ishiguro plays all the emotional chords very well: this is possibly the least British (and most Japanese) of his books, and I think the comparison with Murakami's ""Norwegian Wood"" mood setting is inevitable. Original, masterfully done: I don't give him five stars just because the setting is one bit too artificial, and the author does not care about responding to some obvious questions any intelligent reader would come up with."
2,standard sci-fi premise for a standard romance.,"This may be Ishiguro's most accessible novel since Remains of The Day, but that's not necessarily a good thing. Where The Unconsoled and When We Were Orphans were surreal masterpieces of disjointed dream-illogic, this novel takes a fairly standard science-fiction premise and uses it as the backdrop to a fairly standard yet oddly dispassionate romance. That's not to say that there is nothing to recommend this book. It has its moments of beautiful prose, thought-provoking characterizations and, of course, it's not a semi-autobiographical portrait of a creative writing professor, as so many novels seem to be these days. But it's funny: I just saw the film Me You And Everybody We Know the other night, and it succeeded at the kind of story Ishiguro has told so well in the past far better than this novel does."
3,A good read,"I always heard this was an awesome book, and the plot is very captivating, but I can't say I loved it. I liked reading it, but it wasn't something that I just had to do or something that I particularly looked forward to doing. Certainly not an escapist kind of novel. A good read."
5,an amazing and original work of art,"I heard about this book when reading Roger Ebert's review for the Island. While the theme of the book is similar, it treats the subject with far mroe subtlety, intelligence, and depth of emotion than any film could. Even a week after I finished it I find I am still going over events in the novel in my head. I know this is a book I will read again and that it is the sort of book that I will discover something new about every time I read it."
4,"Superbly crafted, if lacking in passion","Part science fiction, part cultural criticism, ""Never Let Me Go"" is a novel of love and friendship between three young adults raised in modern-day England. Victims of a society whose scientific advances have moved faster than its ability to address the resulting changes in an ethical and conscientious manner, the three share a lifetime bond that must end much too soon.This book reminded me of Margaret Atwood's ""Handmaid's Tale"" in its eerie realism, but without the growing tension. While many of the characters are superbly crafted, and the environment in which the children are raised is incredibly detailed, I was still left wanting more... more resolution, more outrage, more tension, more passion, more SOMETHING.Still, Ishiguro is a master and this book is worth reading, if only for the questions he raises about our ability to deal humanely with the scientific advances we're on the brink of adopting into mainstream culture."
2,Ho hum,"I thought somehow this would be a searching exploration of a future society, but at best it's an enigmatic half-look at what might happen -- with major expository at the end. Nothing I like less in a book than one character having a major speech at the end that makes everything clear. That's an easy ending. Quite a let-down."
2,His worst,"I've read all his books and have greatly enjoyed them. There were two reasons why I didn't like this book:1) It was boring. I kept waiting for something to happen or some great secret to be revealed, but it didn't. Everyone who picks up the book already knows the main premise.2) He creates a world which is essentially realistic (as opposed to the Unconsolable where anything goes). If it is realistic then why do all the donors accept their fate? I can believe that maybe a certain percentage would be brainwashed and accept their fate, but not all of them. This inconsistency ruined the book for me."
1,"Slow, long and repetitive","How could this novel be nominated for a Man Booker Prize? I've read lots of books, and some I don't like very much but at least I can appreciate the structure and the beauty in the writing. Not with this one. It didn't produce anything... not a tear, a laugh or a thrill... flat story, flat characters, rainy days, slow, long, repetitive and predictable."
2,"Overwritten, needs to be 200 pages shorter","This book was mediocre. I couldn't wait untill the last page to be rid of this litany. The message was powerful but needed to be delivered in short, pointed prose. To what ends the superficial descriptions of the sex the Hailsham students were having? The novel is peppered with quasi-erotic scenes which do nothing to advance the themes."
4,"Great book, but forget about the movie!","Even though it is set in a dystopian society, ""Never let me go"" is fundamentally about human relations and how people start deciding early on, even without realizing, their roles in life.Divided in three parts: childhood in boarding school; adult life at the ""Cottages""; donations - the story covers the dynamics between three lifelong friends. They struggle to discover themselves as they struggle to navigate through all the secrets and lies that surrounded their upbringing.Though the plot itself is quite interesting, what struck a special cord for me was how it was told. The author creates an atmosphere that is both bizarre and believable, where the characters are clearly bright and hopeful, yet never try to run from their fates.I read this book in one sitting and watched the movie on the same day. The book was a delight to read, but the movie was a complete disaster: confusing and an utter disappointment."
5,it IS the best book of the decade,"Can't stop thinking about it, it's like slavery or genocide. Who is really a person? I hope the world doesn't end up like this."
4,Bold and subtle,"Never Let Me Go by Ishiguro is thought provoking, romantic, chilling, tragic, simple, subtle...beautifully written. It boldly engages humanity...what is it?"
4,A chilling book about mortality stumbles as a love story,"As a book about boarding school, childhood, English life in the 90s, the lottery of birthright, and death (the word ""complete"" has never been so terrifying), Never Let Me Go gets five stars.As a book about cloning and medical ethics, there is very little here that feels remotely prophetic. The TV show Fringe is a much more unflinching source of nuanced exploration on the costs of scientific progress to human subjects and society at large.As a story of star-crossed lovers, Never Let Me Go stumbles badly. Kathy, Tommy, and Ruth are all fairly well-developed characters, and I can see a lot of myself and people that I know in each of them. But the love triangle is poorly paced and lacking in chemistry and conviction. The way the deferral rumors arise and then are resolved not only failed to light up the relationship storyline, but also dragged down the surrounding material."
5,Much to discuss,"My friends and I read this book as part of a book club. The first thing I liked about it was that it was a fast read. The book was perfect for our discussion because it brought up so many interesting questions about emotions and advances in modern science. We followed the book club by watching the movie, which, while different from the book in many ways, is definitely worth watching."
5,Another classic by Ishiguro,Ishiguro manages to produce a story that is both charming and disturbing. It weaves an important social and moral subject into a marvelously creative storyline.One of my favourite two or three books this year.
5,My favorite book right now,"This story has haunted me for the past 3 weeks. I wish I could describe the experience of reading this book. It's like life itself; so sweet and so sad. If anyone knows of a Never Let Me Go support group, please let me know."
3,A Melancholic Read,"Without giving too much away, I love how the story deals with such morally ambiguous practices as though they were commonplace (as, to the characters, they are). This, at times almost apathetic, tone is exemplified by the absence of any real emotional extremes. Partly because of their upbringing, partly due to their sheltered adulthood, and probably due to a cynicism born out of their selfless destinies, the characters rarely seem to experience any strong passions-positive or negative-until perhaps the final fourth of the book.And so, as realistic as the characters act in the setting they are in, it is tough to become attached to them. The book's strength is perhaps also its weakness."
4,Worth the read for a patient reader,"Don't pick this up expecting a realistic or fast-paced science fiction novel. Ishiguro is a fantastic writer, the prose flows well and I was intrigued by the premise and the characters. However, I did find myself disappointed by the ending. Without giving too much away, I expected something more of a twist or surprise but was left a little disappointed. I've heard from many Remains of the Day is better. So if on the fence about Never Let Me Go, maybe start with Remains and see how Ishiguro's writing strikes you. I enjoyed this book enough that's what I'll be reading next."
5,Doesn't disappoint...,"Can't believe I am the first one to write a review about this quality collection of deep, soulful and jazzy house tracks from Canada's finest. I am a huge fan of Fred Everything's music and remixes since years, and this album doesn't disappoint, trust me. I love 'Light Of Day' which comes here in a new remix, featuring the wonderful vocals of Rise Ashen over a bass-driven deep house monster groove. Other standouts include 'Elevate,' a jazzy house instrumental, and of course 'Next To Me' feat. Roy Davis Jr. However, I also have to admit that it's not as good as his first full-length album 'Everything Under The Sun,' which was probably impossible to beat anyway. But then, 'Everything Under The Sun' grew on me over the years, and the same thing could happen with this album..."
4,Fred Everything - Light Of Day,"Fred Everything's second full-length, LIGHT OF DAY, is a solid house album, melodic enough for home listening, rhythmic enough to work in the clubs. Fred Everything here relies more heavily on vocals than on UNDER THE SUN, and the lyrics give the songs nice texture (though often with a disco twist). And while there's nothing bad about the album, only a few tracks really stick out. The electro groove of ""Find Your Way"" adds some sparkle and the dub reggae feel of ""Close to You"" bring a necessary splash of variation to the album. The energetic drum breaks of ""Elevate"" or the Spanish guitar and spoken word of ""Our Love"" also change things up. But some of it fades into the background, too. Luckily, ""That Thang"" isn't one of those tracks -- its sexiness stands out. There's still plenty of that Fred Everything magic."
1,Mis-leading!,"If you are looking at this CD, thinking to yourself, ""cool, I love acoustic/unplugged music""... THINK AGAIN.Although the CD is called ""Acoustic 80's"", do NOT expect any of the songs to be acoustic performances! All of the songs are studio versions.While it is a good CD of 80's tunes... it should NOT be called ""Acoustic 80's""!"
3,"Great Music, But...","I didn't realize the CD part of this release would be identical to the single CD release from last year. While the music is all 5 star, great Bowie stuff, it would have been nice to have some different songs on this one. As for the DVD, it wasn't really too exciting. It might just be me, but the bolly remixes don't seem to add much to the music."
2,Hmmmm,"I don't know why they chose such a coarse grit for the stone. It will sort of scratch up the back side of your hooks but there's no way to get an exceptional point or for that matter to remove a burr from the inside of your hooks. I guess I don't see a lot of value here, although they are on to the correct packaging - very compact. This would be a home run if they'd substitute the crude synthetic stone they currently use with about a 100 Japanese water stone using the same groove pattern, and then add a small flat file of good quality. I'd gladly pay 2x the price."
2,Misleading titles,This is a throw away dvd. It didn't have the one movie listed that I wanted. Just a bunch of B westerns. Rip off.
4,Enjoyable if forgettable,"The Bottom Line:When you walk away and think about the plot of State of Play there are a dozen plot holes and the denouement falls rather flat, but it works as a solid thriller while you're watching it, providing two hours of fast-moving entertainment without seeming to insult your intelligence; if you want a disposable 120 minutes of movie fun, by all means check this film out.3/4"
3,Abbreviated version of the BBC series,"This movie is 2 hour version of the BBC series by the same name. Peppered with many accomplished international movie stars it gives this film special allure. However, I have seen BBC series and I liked series better, because it allowed characters to be better developed and complex. In any case, it is a very interesting political thriller about love hate relationship between corporate world and politics, politics and journalism and how personal relationships fit into all of that."
4,Russell Crowe excels as usual,"Excellent all star cast, good story line, many twists and turns. Good Amazon on-demand selection. HD streaming quality was excellent"
4,Enjoyed the drama,Enjoyed the intrigue. The characters believable. Who would have thought a politician could be corrupted? LOL. Enjoyed Russell Crowes performance.
3,"It's a remake, go to the original","The original BBC miniseries was more compelling, and that has little to do with the cross-Atlantic translation of the story. The core of the story is the relationship between reporter (Crowe) and politician (Affleck) who in this version are supposed to be... old college roommates? The film is mis-cast. Affleck appears to young, Crowe too old for the personal dynamics that we are supposed to invest in to drive the story. Good writing, solid direction and entertaining support from Helen Mirren and Rachel McAdams can't leap over this hurdle. The actors originally cast in the lead roles: a re-teaming of the ""Fight Club"" duo of Brad Pitt and Edward Norton. Too bad Hollywood scheduling couldn't allow for that pair - their established dynamic would have been a great engine for this occasionally thrilling drama."
3,No regrets.,Glad we saw it but could easily have missed it. Terrific cast and fairly well directed. The script needs lots of help.
3,Good show,"The show was good, better than most (not my type of show), my husband would have given it five stars."
4,Like it,This was a good movie that keeps you attention. I think it is really close to reality in the political arena.
3,"GOOD ACTING, BUT STORY BURNS OUT LONG BEFORE THE CREDITS ROLL!","I was disappointed in this film as it seemed to go on forever despite an excellent performance by Crowe. It starts off promising, but soon slows to a snails pace. Smart?...maybe, but this is ultimately boring with an anti-climatic ending that wasn't all that surprising."
2,Disappointing,"It is a disappointing movie. I would hate to think that Russell Crowe gained weight for this movie. Comparing to some other well known conspiracy movies this one falls short almost in every respect. The plot lacks focus and is messy. It seems that the director only wanted to take advantage of certain recent events, like the Blackwater inquiry.I have seen movies that are much worse, but the two stars express my disappointment with a movie that looked promising. Even if my expectations were not higher, though, I would not give it more than three stars."
2,9th rate ending,"This has all the promises of a great flick.The plot is taut, relevant, and suspenseful. We know the company the film really refers to.There's also great cast. Hard to go wrong, but it did.You would have thought that with all the sophisticated test screening, market research ... etc. to protect their investments, the people who made this film could come up a with a better ending comparable to something like Michael Clayton. But they didn't.Either the research company the producers hired was testing the film at a wrong audience, or the real event this film is based on has still not fully run its course.One way or the other, the producers should fire the market research company that tells them the film will do well.Hope they can correct this if ever there's going to be a director's cut."
1,"Trust me and buy the BBC version, not this one","The BBC's mini series, State of Play, on which the American version was, well, sort of, based, is so far superior, it paralyzes the mind. With so many fine actors in the U.S. version, how the director, Kevin MacDonald, managed to get such sorry performances is beyond belief.One thing this 2009 movie (ever wonder why it's already on DVD and Pay TV?) has that's useful: It will put an insomniac to sleep in ten minutes.On the other hand, the BBC version is exciting, taut, suspenseful, and the casting is superb, with Bill Nigh in the original role of newspaper editor (given to Helen Mirren in the American version. For once, she is not perfect).Trust me and spend the extra few bucks to buy the BBC version on Amazon.com."
3,Good Acting - Interesting Plot,"Russell Crowe gives a great performance in this drama set in Washington, DC. Helen Mirren also did a good job as the Editor of a major DC newspaper. The plot is a little hard to follow and the actors voices were quite low at times making it hard to understand their words. The movie gives a good look into the newspaper publishing business, and Russell Crowe spent a lot of time before making the movie visiting the Post and learning everything he could about the industry. Really good acting, but you must pay close attention - has some good twists."
4,A Really Good PG-13 Mystery,"We both enjoyed this movie and can recommend it highly. Everything about the movie contributes to creating a well paced, tight, action movie that keeps one wondering how it will end. The story is timely and although it has some liberal agenda overtones these are not so blatant as to compromise the movie.There was one small problem and that was the surround sound sometimes drowned out the dialog and made it difficult to follow the plot. The solution was to activate the English captions and that solved the problem. This is one of those movies where the dialog counts for something.All told it was an entertaining movie for the evening."
3,"Good thriller, but goes a little too far","A lot of the movie is handled deftly, well-cast, and crisp dialog. The problem overall is that there are too many coincidences, tangled and questionable relationships, and trying to hold the unraveling threads together gets to be annoying. The insider aspects of the washington world get cartoonish at times and you need to accept them stylistically to enjoy the film. The coincidences about the stolen briefcase, the reporter's relationship with someone's wife, the ending twist about the wife knowing about the $26,000 a month and discovering the killer's true employer, a bit over the top and sloppy. The movie tried to create too much subtext and complications, but it wasn't properly developed. Again, deft in places, but only average because of annoyances."
4,Movie,"I liked this movie, Amazon if they are going to charge so much for a movie rental perhaps you should work on your streaming? Everytime I watch anything on your site the playback stops several times because of streaming issues. Not worth the price really."
3,Crowe got fat,Russell Crowe really let him self go on this role. Looks like at least 25 lbs. to me. Too bad.
4,"Great movie for $.99, very good otherwise","Well don, great actors, kept your attention and suspense for the whole movie. A little over acted by most of the characters and the Good guy/bad guy government/military people a bit over done, but by Hollywood's liberal slant, it could have been worse. It was entertaining and that's what you want. I'd watch it again to figure out some points I think I missed and to fill in some holes that weren't clear. The ending was a little blear. It left you wanting a little more closure. Overall, Very Good."
3,Crowe With a Tummy,"Crowe put on some pounds for this role, but he was still a great performer. The movie wasn't very exciting, just enough to keep me watching. Very dry performance by Affleck. Rachel was great as always."
3,State of Play,"Good movie, a litle slow at times. Russell Crowe seems typecast, and Helen Mirren's great talent is wasted. Overall worth a view."
3,Disappointing,I fell asleep before it was over and never really had a desire to watch it again. It just didn't hold my interest.
4,"Really Excellent, Fast-Paced Drama","This was a sleeper-film, incredibly well done, a taut political/investigative journalism thriller....the acting, cast and presentation was top-notch ( especially Crowe and Afleck ).My only question is how did I miss this one? It was only out about five years ago and I don't remember seeing it advertised at all. In fact, Amazon sent it to me as one of my recommendations and I only checked out the trailer because Crowe was in it...and it grabbed me right away.I would highly recommend it to anyone who likes edge-of-your-seat military/political intrigue. This movie is about the triumph of the little guy, in this case, a low-key, street-smart, burn-out reporter, who hangs on to his ethics, doggedly pursuing a blockbuster expose against all odds in search of the truth."
4,mystery. fun. intrigue.,Good solid action suspense film. Brilliant through the end. Keeps you guessing. Solid acting. Understated. Highly recommend to wider audiences.
3,Rated: Eh....,"Film opens w/an unrealistic chase scene. It's a decent plot. It fell flat w/me, though. I didn't feel an inspired performance from any of the characters. The feeling was: latest project (of the month), latest paycheck, ho_hum... It's not a bad film. It's just another cookie-cutter film w/predictable plot twists, & some unrealistic scenes. I'd give it a C+/B-."
3,Good but somehow misses the mark,"I really wanted to like this film. The premise is interesting and somewhat timely. The allusions to Blackwater contracts are a current issue today, especially in the wake of recent findings on torture. But somehow this movie dances around those issues and ekes out more time on the Washington sex sleaze that we see time and again. It's almost as if the filmmaker wanted to do more but was somehow restrained, which is a plot of the film itself. Crowe is solid as usual but Ben Affleck is wooden, and he has lots of screen time for someone with... let's face it everyone; Ben is a nice guy but has limited acting chops. Worth seeing but beware, you might not be as suspended as you think you will be."
4,fast moving,intelligent plot - editing makes for fast moving thriller that keeps you engaged and guessing right up to the end.
2,Predictable and Cliched,"Despite a stellar cast, this one falls short. It is almost as if the movie tries to make up for its weak plot by adding complexity. The movie gets sillier as it goes along. I would give this one a miss..."
2,What a waste of Russel Crowe,This is when I wish I had a rich vocabulary and creative writing talent.The movie was so formula-ic and predictable as to make the viewer wish fora refund. It somehow managed to make even Russell Crowe look bad. Had potential but poorly executed. Watch it if there's nothing else to watch.
5,Intriga hasta el último momento,Sin tantas palabras esta película vale la pena verla si buscas intriga y suspenso hasta el final. Las actuaciones son muy buenas y Russel Crow se adapta bien al papel del reportero/investigador. La trama es creíble y se desenvuelve rápidamente así que no te aburrirás. Vale la pena. Go for it...
2,Sporadically interesting but overall boring,"This movie has somewhat of an interesting take on the sad state of newspapers, political corruption and big business resorting to illegal activities to achieve their goals with the assistance of certain politicians. I did like the story and the acting but the movie does not keep a steady pace. It picks up speed and then several times slows down to the point where you want to fast forward all the unnecessary chatter. And there is too much of this chatter. With better direction and editing the movie could be half an hour shorter and double as interesting. Fine acting from all the actors cannot dispel the fog of poor editing and the rambling direction. Avoid this one - the movie will leave you with a feeling of boredom."
2,How Many Far-Left Tropes Can One Movie Have?,"Just thankfull I have an unlimited DVD's account! The DVD was, for all practical purposes, free.Absolutely the worst movie promoting the looney left's view of the world ever!MediaCorp, gee, think they might be targeting real world NewsCorp?Pointblank, gee, think they might be targeting Blackwater?Adulterous but pure hearted congressman, gee think they're not only channeling Teddie but all the rest of the tax cheat/bribe-taking/adulterous congressman who continue in office because they serve the Left?And then, ""the reporter"", based on the deference shown him this guy is making well into six figures annually, his ""office"" space is as realistic as a Star Trek ""bridge"" and he lives in a hovel! Notice the four foot high stack of old newspapers.This movie could only appeal to those that believe MSNBC & Olberman have an even tenous connection to reality."
2,hollywood grinds out another boring clone.,"as someone else mentioned, basically ten minutes in one can see how this movie will unfold, with a bit of a twist at the end. Once again Hollywood plays it evil military complex type card, and it's boring and uncreative. In these type movies you can almost guarantee the face of evil will be either military industry related, a big corporation, or some neo nazi group. There was little suspence in this movie, and nothing to keep me at the edge of my seat."
2,Yawn.,"I love Russell Crowe, but I have to say, this was a boring, forgettable flick.Don't waste your time.LM"
4,late night distraction,"They we were, home with nothing to do but watch a movie and picked this one out of the group. Surprise! It was darn good and I don't think I had ever heard of it before. So the bottom line is ....way better than average and it made an entertaining evening."
2,Somewhat entertaining.. NOT.,"Ok, how many times has this story been told. Politician caught with young girl, politician being bribed by evil conservatives.. PS LIBERALS ARE EVIL NOT CONSERVATIVES.. girl dies. Politician gives it all for the love of his life (not wife) dead girl.. Give me a break..."
2,OK Commuter Bike,"I purchased this bike as a commuter bike to work (about 6 miles one way). I also intend to use it on hard packed dirt bike trails with my kids as they get older. After riding this bike for some time and then comparing it to a traditional chain drive bike with multiple gears it has become obvious that you have to work much harder on this bike to get the same speed. I had a 60+ year old pass me once! All that said, if you ride on flat ground and don't care about speed, only commuting a limited distance this may still be a good choice if the advantages of not having a chain outweigh the downside of less power and speed."
3,Damaged in shipping,"I received this product as a gift. The first one had a bad set of gears. Since I liked the concep, I returned it for a new one. The second one had both front and rear rims badly bent. I spent hours ""trueing"" the rims. Now that that is over, it rides great. My longest ride so far is a little over ten miles. I commute 3 miles each way to work a few times a week."
4,About the D-Drive system,"From their website...The Dekra D-Drive uses a drive shaft to transmit power from the bike pedals to the rear wheel. This drive shaft employs a fully-enclosed bevel gear system made of a lightweight, yet highly durable, aluminum alloy. Shimano internal gears within the rear wheel enable the D-Drive system to deliver smooth, quiet performance while optimizing pedaling efficiency. A three-speed Shimano ""twist and go"" gear system provides easy, responsive gear shifting operated at the hand grip. So there's no more grasping for hard to reach gear shift levers!"
4,Dekra Bike,"The bike is great. The D-drive works very well. The only drawback is that I bought it as a low maintenance bike, which it is as long as you do not ride it in sandy or dusty conditions and don't get it wet. The rear bevel gear will allow dust and water to enter. They had to do this in order to allow for the removal of the wheel. Maybe some sort of seals would improve this."
2,"Sorry, had to return it","I was expecting this bike to be comfortable and easy to ride, as it was described. In my opinion, it was neither. I was interested in the inclosed, chainless transmission, but that did not make up for my disappointment in other areas. I returned it (thank you Amazon!) for full credit and bought a Trek comfort bike. Almost twice the cost, but it fit the comfortable-and-easy-to-ride feature set I was looking for."
2,Spend more and get a better one,"If I didn't keep the instruction paper wrapped around this with a rubber band, I would never remember how this works. It will find the stud, but will you know where it is? Too complicated. I rarely need it so I am not buying another, but I wouldn't buy this again if it came up missing."
2,Irrelevent Ancient History.,Unless you are interested in big egoed photographers of a bygone era you can safely pass on this one. Not much there about making images it is pretty much just a glorification of Bert Stern and a time that has passed.
4,works well,"I bought this remote to use with my Pioneer touchscreen unit, the remote works like a charm. It's just too bad that I sold the truck two weeks after getting the remote."
4,Better than the original!`,"Good to have as a spare for the one that came with the radio. It has more features than the original. Works well, but like the original, it has trouble in bright sunlight. The price is right. BL"
4,Exelent Product,"Thank remotes work perfectly, are good and I recommend you buy it. no problem with it. it was what i looking for."
4,Nice Remote,"This is a nice remote for my AVH P3200BT, but as others have stated, it doesn't work all the features on my unit.Just the important ones, and that's why it's a keeper! Oh... and you got to love the small size. There's a smallopening just below the radio on my 2002 Ford Escape where it fits perfect w/o Velcro!"
5,Beautiful book at a GREAT price,"I first saw this book while visiting the Schindler archive at the University of California Santa Barbara. As I am in the process of writing a book about the history of SILVER LAKE, I dearly wanted to have a copy for my research, but was hesitant because of the price. When I was able to purchase a ""like new"" copy from a reseller at a discounted price, I jumped at the opportunity. I was even more surprised when the seller, who happened to be a neighbor, delivered the book in person to my house the next day!"
3,I Like It,"Not being Armenian, I can't vouch for the authenticity of the performance, but it strikes me as being the real thing. The music is mostly subdued with occasional sections of emotional exuberance. Since most of the work is fairly dark, I wouldn't recommend this to those who have immature tastes in music or are looking for some more of that ""purty Russian music"". I would recommend it, without hesitation, to those who enjoy Eastern Orthodox music and aren't hung up on the purty Russian music stereotype. I think a good test of whether or not this is for you is: If you think the ""music"" of Jackson Berkey is pure slop then you stand a good chance of liking this recording. The all male choir is not a spit and polish professional group, but they are directed well, do a good job, and convey genuine feeling in their performance. The solo work is quite good. Good listening for your melancholy days."
1,Not uplifting,"I bought this cd with the hopes that it would sound like the music in my church. However, I was disappointed when the music was rather depressing and monotone. I love the armenian church music but this cd didn't do it justice. Sorry."
1,What - no prop 65 warning,"Interesting - many electronics products contain California prop 65 warnings for trace amounts of toxic substances, but the greenies got these lamps by the regulators even though they contain mercury. Just google cfl bulb dangers to see what breaking one in you home can cost you in hazmat cleanup. Bring back incandescent light bulbs!!!!"
1,Contains toxic chemical,"These light bulbs contain mercury, which can cause brain damage or kill you. They also destroy the environment by leaching mercury out of landfills into your groundwater. The light isn't as nice as incandescent bulbs, and it will give you migraines. They don't give off enough heat to warm up your room a little, which means they are less pleasant at night and in the wintertime and you will have to run your furnace more, negating some of the energy savings."
1,Lies,"Don't be fooled by the product description. I've bought two sets of these (16 in total) and not one casts even the slightest bit of light. Sure, the price is great, but what they aren't telling you is that you need to buy something else (i.e., send them more of your $$$!!!) to screw these into. Well guess what, we the consumers are the ones who are really getting SCREWED! On their own, they are useless, and according to some people, toxic. What a rip-off!"
5,Going Green Was Never So Easy!,I recently decided to change all the light bulbs in my apartment but the bulbs at the store were so expensive. This was the best deal I found. So affordable! So far every bulb is still going strong and my electric bill is noticably cheaper! Would definitely recommend this to anyone!
5,60 watt replacements,They are good to have on hand because they work very well when you need a replacement bulb.
4,These are CFL bulbs and they work!,"These are simply CFL light bulbs, you screw them in, flip the switch and they light. These are the same color as incandescent light bulbs and provide sift lighting. I have no idea how much life that they will give, but if they are anything like other ones that I have used, they will last around 3 years being used 8-10 hours a day. This is just a rough guess!!I am unusual that I prefer the brighter white ""daylight"" bulbs (5000K) that have the harsh white color. It has taken some getting use to these being a more yellowish tint. These are probably around 2700K.In summary, they are a pretty good price, they work, and they use less energy than incandescent bulbs."
4,Great!,Super cheap and work pretty well. Sucks that we have to pay for them now.I believe that the color is little more towards the tungsten/red side.All in all I would recommend for its price.
1,Don't waste your money,"*IF* & I stress the word *IF*... you buy this product...SAVE YOUR RECEIPT or WHEN this product does NOT last up to it's ""guarantee"" the company will do nothing for you. We bought a package of these bulbs one year ago (almost to the day!) when we moved into our new place. Today the last bulb blew. In no way has this product lived up to even half of what GE says it will. Regular light bulbs have lasted much longer, being used longer!"
5,Great energy savings - Not for all applications,You can't get 5 years out of these if the heat from the bulb have no place to go. It's not commonly known but you can't put these in closed fixtures or recessed fixtures cause the heat will cause premature failure on these bulbs. You will have 30 - 50% failure rate within 2 years if they overheat. Energy saving will not be achieved if you try this in a closed fixture or a fixture with a closed top (heat rises to the top). This is very inefficient if you keep replacing these bulbs every 2 years cause the energy used to produce these and there higher cost will easily eat up the savings your trying to get from these low energy bulbs. Half my fixture are not compatible with these bulbs. They just burn out with a year or two. This applies to all brand names not just the GE branded bulbs.
2,The reality,"I'm giving up on these things...As many others have noted, they only last a couple of years, not 5 years as stated. The problem is you can't turn these things on and off like you do a normal bulb. So if you put them in a bathroom for example where you do this several times though out the day, it shortens the life.Also, if the bulbs put out a very yellow light and are not the same as a ""60 watt"" bulb. You can confirm this with any camera light meter. The ""Daylight"" bulb that is rated at 6500K is a nice white bulb, brightness is improved a bit as well... but they cost more.If you have a location where you need to walk in at 9AM, turn the lights on, then turn them off at 9PM, and don't care about how yellow things look, then these may be just the ticket. But the reality is for home use, most bulbs are turned on and off several times a day and these bulbs can't handle it. Any minor energy savings is offset by cost of the bulb.Only use these in lights that stay on for hours at a time."
4,Not candelabra base bulbs,"These bulbs will not fit in a fan that requires candelabra base-style bulbs. I purchased these bulbs as these were listed as frequently bought together with the ""Westinghouse 7861500 Contempra Trio Three-Light 42-Inch Five-Blade Ceiling Fan, Brushed Nickel with Frosted Glass Shades"" fan. However, upon receiving these bulbs, I noticed that they were not the candelabra-style bulbs that are required by the fan.I have no reason to doubt these are good bulbs, but they are not what I needed for the ceiling fan."
2,Not for me!,"I had 60w bulbs before and thought these would be the same brightness. They arnt, much dimmer, but the worst thing is that it takes a few minutes to 'warm up"". I would not recommend"
1,Pure junk!,"I bought two packs of these. I now regret it. Seems I am changing these GE bulbs every month or less. They are pure junk. I have bought the Walmart brand, that was cheaper, and lasted alot longer. DON'T BUY THESE bulbs, unless you enjoy donating to GE."
1,GE Helical 13W bulbs don't last long,About a year ago I bought several GE Helical 13W bulbs from HomeDepot. Two of he bulbs would not work when I first installed them and another 3 bulbs would not light up to full power unless I tapped them with my finger. They rest of the bulbs burned out within 6 months. These bulbs were on less than a couple of hours a day+
2,"Stark white color, large bulbs. Not recommended.","I purchased these a few weeks back. I've tried them in several places in the house and in several different lamp styles. They are just not going to work for us. The light is a stark white, institutional-like color. The bulbs are also larger than another GE smart energy bulb that I purchased several years ago.These bulbs have been relegated to lighting an unfinished basement where color & size really does not matter. They also are being used as a security light outdoors. These bulbs are fine for those purposes, but otherwise this is not a product that I can recommend.I was very disappointed - need to go find those other GE energy smart bulbs which were much better, more compact and a softer color of light. I purchased them at big cheap-o-mart for around 2-bux a piece. Unlike the unfavorable reviews & reports of this particular product, those other GE bulbs are still working after 3 years and only one of 6 has a ""buzzing"" problem.Not recommended."
3,They're okay,"I like these because they are blinding. Very soft bright light. However, they have a delay when you turn them on... which is kind of annoying... I hope they last long."
4,Excellent value,"The downside: These aren't quite ""instant on"" like many others on the market - they take about a second to light up. They're also physically longer than most other 13W CFLs, which will cause issues in some fixtures. Also seem to be slightly dimmer than some others, though admittedly I've only tried one and it hasn't had a chance to break in yet.The upside: They're made by GE, so they should outlast most of the other bulbs on the market. And these are an awesome value, even when they're not on sale. The packaging has also been updated to be a bit more eco-friendly - not nearly as much plastic in the newer packaging.I have a few other GE CFLs that are 5+ years old and still work great, though they're only used a couple of hours a day.I'd give them 5 stars if they were truly instant on."
4,Good but want to try other models...,"I got this package for $6.99 from Amazon in Set.2010. They are bright and glow in a bit yellow... I am not sure their life because few of them already dead. Also, the space between tubes are not closed enough, I mean it is taller than other brand. If you need them in rush, then go get it. Otherwise, you can find more good deals out there like Walgreens has Feit Electric ECO 75 watt-uses only 18 watts for $1 each, but YMMV..."
4,"Excellent deal, but with minor problems","At only one dollar per bulb, it's a steal. The insanely low price makes it even cheaper than an incandescent bulb, not to mention electric bill savings. However there are problems, most significant of which is inconsistent luminance from bulb to bulb. Some of them are as bright as 60W (somewhere between 650 and 800 lumens) but others are not even competent 40W replacements--even my 40W equivalent LED is much brighter.Unless you are a real environmentalist or concerned with possible mercury contamination (especially for your children's safety) there's no big reason to buy an LED. I spent over $100 on five bulbs just to feel the technological advancement, but the power bill looks just the same as before."
5,Happy with them.,"I bought these bulbs for the price, they are a lot cheaper then the ones in the stores. The bulbs come in a big pack which is nice because it saves on packaging but trying to store in my tiny utility closet was not to fun.When I read the reviews I was a little skeptical because of people say they burn out before they should have. So I wrote the dates on them when I put them in my light fixtures, three months later they are still going strong so i guess only time will tell. If they do make it to there promised lifetime then i will be buying these again, if not I guess I got what i paid for and I'll go back to buying them at the more expensive price."
5,No other bulb lasts as long,"In my experience the less expensive CFLs that I have purchased from Walmart, target and home depot...all fail well within the promised time period. GE is the only one that exceeds their guarantee. How do I know? well, we have a dark kitchen and the light is switched on at 5 am and switched off only at 10 pm....almost precisely everyday including weekends, so we have good data!"
5,Worked out,I was worried about ordering bulbs to have shipped but they came very nicely packaged and would recommend for anyone not wanting to overpay for these bulbs.
4,great price for these bulbs,"The price for these bulbs is comparable, if not better, than just about any home improvement store's prices.I needed to replace some hot burning, incandescent bulbs in a light fixture in my dining room.These burn much cooler and the softer light for a dining room is very effective.I would not recommend these bulbs for reading with though."
4,"OK, but slow to reach full brightness","These bulbs are OK, but not as bright as expected, and take a while to reach full brightness when turned on."
1,Bulbs don't fit!,"These bulbs were advertised as being bought with the Globe 5203801 Energy Saving Desk Lamp, Metallic Silver Sold by: Amazon.com LLC (""Frequently Bought Together""). They don't fit! Why would they be packaged together? Who makes these choices? How long will this combination be advertised (I just checked and these are still be advertised together)?"
4,"Great for the Price, Worked for me!","Some of the lights had gone out in our house and I decided to pick these lights up at really nice price here on amazon. Like many I really didn't pay attention to how bright they would be or what not. When I put them in they were definitively not as bright as I expected. Luckily we were only replacing a bathroom and kitchen light and so we really didn't need the extra light. If you are purchasing these and plan to put them in an area where you would like very bright lighting then you may want to upgrade to the next brightness up. I probably would have gone done to the store to get some brighter bulbs if these needed to go in major lighted areas. But, you cant beat the price and they definitely get the job done!"
3,Should have bought daylight,"I didn't realize that these economy packs would be the less bright lights, but more brown tones rather that daylight or bright white. I will keep them, and eventually figure out some places to use them, but I should have paid more attention when I bought them."
4,"Bought the 8 pack, one defective, one dead after 5 months.","Overall I am pleased with the quality of the product. (Not sure why there was a defective bulb inside...) Have been using the other 7 bulbs for five months, and all perform well except one that I put on the balcony. I think the cold temperature may have killed it. Great product for the price (less than $1 each)."
2,"lasted 1 year, not 5","Got tired of ripping through the package of these bulbs, so I made a little chart that I put in my closet where I store my bulbs. The chart has location and number of bulbs in fixture, date replaced, date burned out. Lasted about one year (did not calculate # of hours). Should've kept the receipt, but I actually did not think they would last such a short time when I initially bought them. You need the receipt and UPC to get a refund. They have a nice color, so go ahead and buy them, but keep your receipt!"
4,"Turn on fast - little longer than ""normal""","These all arrived in once piece (something I was afraid of after reading other reviews!), and installed easily. They also turn on fast at almost full brightness, something that I guess the newer energy efficient bulbs do? I have some older ones (two years or so) that take awhile to warm up. These are almost right away, which is great!The only problem I have with them is that they are a little longer than other 60 watt energy efficient bulbs I have, resulting in one more twist at the top. This caused them to not fit in the light holders in my bathroom that have plastic caps on them. I'm not sure if these are the ""normal"" size and my other bulbs were just short, or what, but that was a disappointment and I'll have to try to find smaller bulbs specifically for those lights."
4,Good light bulbs for the price,Pros:The light bulbs are pretty cheap for compact fluorescent bulbs when they were on sale (~$1 per light bulb).It does what it suppose to do... Light up and save more energy than conventional light bulbs.Cons:This light bulb takes 1 second to light up and a few min to warm up to full strength. I thought about putting it in the washroom but decided against it because of the warm up time.
5,Great Value!,These bulbs produce a warm yellow light. I have used them in ceiling fans because they are small enough to fit inside the votives. You won't regret this purchase!
4,Can't beat the price,"87 cents a bulb? Can't beat that.They are somewhat longer than a typical ""A"" bulb (which is just the classic bulb shape), so inspect your current fixtures beforehand.The packaging says they're good down to 5F, so I imagine they'd be fine in an outside enclosure."
3,really yellow...,"I purchased these bulbs knowing that they would be yellower than the daylight CFLs I have in my bedroom and office, but I was not expecting that they would be yellower than the incandescents they replaced. I am doubling them up with whiter bulbs in my living room for the moment, and they'll certainly be staying behind when I move at the end of the month, while the whiter ones go with me. They're not suitable for reading, and I don't trust them over my bathroom mirror, but they'll do for the kitchen, hallway, and dining room."
3,expect good quality,"I order 6 packs, after installation, I immediately noticed not all of them are same. Some white, some yellow (software white)."
2,Don't buy into the hype,"The bulbs obviously use less electricity, and if they lasted as long as they claimed then they would be worth the extra cost. But they don't. I've bought these for the last 3 years and they burn out as quickly as a regular bulb. 4 of them smoked when they burnt out and one even had flames come out of them for a second. I bought these from Amazon now because they were a good price and it would even out cost wise.This is another bad idea from the ""green"" people. Environmentaly it does not ""save"" anything and probably is worse when you consider disposal and cost. Sort of like low flow toilets. Yes they save water every flush, but you have to flush 3 times to get the waste to go down."
1,Lasted less than 1000 hours (worse than incandescent),"Sharpie the install date on ALL CFL's. As an electrician, I've noticed that CFL's in real-world applications seem to last LESS LONG than incandescent type lamps. This seems to apply to all brands, although I would have expected a GE to live up to its >5000 hour rating. CFL's still should be a savings over incandescents, but BARELY. PLEASE mark your install dates and light up social media if you find the same thing I do: CFL's don't last >5000 hours.[...][...]"
1,Bad for environment,"These type of bulbs loose up to 85% of their life if turned on and off a lot. One broken bulb can contaminate up to 6000 gallons of drinking water. Just search for the correct method on how to clean up a broken bulb in your home, it's THREE pages long."
4,Saving The Planet One Light At A Time,"With all the talks about saving energy on electricity bills today, and inflation on the rise, there are simple ways you can save money on your home services. One of them is buying these simple GE Energy Smart Light Bulbs. They are simple and easy to install, and last a whole lot longer than traditional light bulbs. On top of that, they shine just as boldly and brightly as the regular 60 Watt light bulbs. Although they do cost a little more in price as one, than the regular full 60 watts, but you also can save a lot of money in the long run, and they last 5x longer than a burn out you'd get very quickly from a regular light bulb. I absolutely recommend you buy these light bulbs, because they are worth the money. Hopefully, with all the talk of people trying to go green in savings, you can help save the planet, if we all use one energy saving light bulb at a time.Price: B+Quality: BEasy To Install: BOverall: B 1/2+"
1,No bargain,I installed a 13W Feit CFL in my daughter's table lamp on Feb. 1; last night (Feb 6) it had quit working. That's no 7-year life. It was on for a total of 6 hours maximum. Don't buy this brand.
1,avoid,"Purchased these a few months ago and 2 stopped working and 2 started buzzing,returned them back to the package and back to the store.Not worth the time or the bother-Avoid!"
3,Very poor packaging,These came packaged in such a way that Each bulb is individually wrapped making it very hard for storage I was expecting factory packaging. See photos to understand I will most likely give these away unless they will take them for return. I do not have room to store such a big box in my small apartment.
2,TERRIBLE DONOT BUY !,SHORT LAMP LIFE. PRETTY USELESS CUSTOMER SERVICE AND WEB SITE WON'T ACCEPT COMPLAINTS / REQUEST FOR REPLACEMENTS !!! DO NOT BUY !!!!!!!
1,CFLs appear to be total scam,GE seems to be the only brand I see in stores. I have had terrible experiences with my GE CFLs. They DO NOT last as long as they claim. The ones that claim to be instant-on may start quickly --but the illumination level takes MINUTES to be remotely useful. Others take more than a second to actually turn on. I hope LEDs are better and the price comes down quickly. GE is setting themselves up for a major backlash if someone can deliver a better product.
1,Damaged,"Product arrived with one of the bulbs smashed in the sealed GE packaging. This was a defect that should have been disovered by the manufacturer and Amazon. Also, these are not low profile bulbs and they are taller than a standard incandecent bulb."
2,poor quality control,"Unfortunately GE has decided to market low quality imported CFL from China with little regard to how long they last. Several of these bulbs malfunctioned on the day I used them. When that happens, your savings is down the tube. Fortunately GE will send you a coupon if you get a bad batch of bulbs. Next time I will try a different manufacturer"
2,One arrived shattered,"7 of the 8 bulbs work fine, though one of them arrived shattered. The light they put off matches that of the incandescent bulbs they replaced."
5,Very Satisfied!!,"My home is relatively dark and I was a little apprehensive about trying the cfl bulbs so I kept putting it off. I finally tried them and I was very surprised! Compared to my regular 60 watt bulbs, I found these to be slightly brighter and more of a white light. I read a lot of reviews prior to trying them, and I'm surprised that some people think they aren't as bright. I'm curious as to why that is. Anyway, as for me, I am extremely pleased with them, I only wish I had switched sooner! Oh, and in my lamps they take about 20 to 30 seconds to warm up completely. So no big deal there."
2,Amazon. Need to pack bulbs better.,"The Amazon box was barely big enough to hold the two GE 13-Watt light packages? And one piece of bubble wrap on the side? Wrong!! One of the packages had shattered glass when I opened it? Are you aware of the dangerous health risks of broken CFL bulbs? I am, and do not appreciate opening a potentially hazardous package in the mail."
2,Bad package,one of the bulb was broken in the package and i am asking for replacement but they didn't care. That's not fair.
5,Love the lighting,"I love the lighting these put off. Its a lot better than the traditional incandescent bulbs. Our house is a lot brighter and has a cleaner look.Pros:A lot more efficient than incandescent bulbs.They are brighter and have a cleaner look than incandescent bulbs.Cons:They take about half a second before they turn on. I sometimes have to double check I turned the switch on.They take about a minute or longer before they are at 100% brightness.The are longer than our incandescent bulbs, so in certain fixtures they stick out and look a little out of place.Overall: I would recommend these to anyone. I am planing on buying another set the replace all my incandescent bulbs. I should be able to scrape $5-10 off each months electricity bill, making these pay for themselves in 1-2 months per set."
3,Too yellowish to my taste,"I wish I knew more about the color of light bulbs before I ordered this.This light bulb has a color of soft white (2700 K), which just too yellowish to me and drives me crazy.I also tried some other bulbs with day light color (6500K), which is too white to me and the room looked too cold.Finally, I find that the most comfortable color temperature for me is 3500 K, informally called bright light. It is a good balance between whiteness and warmness I want."
2,too long to fit in my fixture,"These bulbs are taller than a 60W incandescent and therefore don't fit in my fixtures. (My fixtures are the sealed outdoor style with a heavy but small glass enclosure.) Nothing in the product spec told me the size of the bulbs, and the probably work fine in most lamps. I bought these because the Sylvania 29149 ""mini twist"" bulbs are more than twice the price. My purchasing the Sylvanias in the first place was pure luck; now I know I'm a captive audience."
2,Not good 60w replacements,Lights are good in rooms with low cielings but do not put out very good light. some bulbs in pack did not work as well as others and some have to warm up. Not real happy with them at all.
4,Good bulbs,"First of all this was a great deal for energy efficient bulbs. Second I really like these, my complaint about energy efficient bulbs has always been they are dimmer than ordinary bulbs and that they leave you with this weird white light, which is unusual when your used to the classic yellow light.HOWEVER, these bulbs while slightly hardly noticeably dimmer than a regular 60 watt bulb are a classic yellow light and I was quite impressed by this. I really like them, will likely order again when they burn out eventually."
5,Makes car washes last longer,"Got this locally but it works great. 5min in the morning before heading out, a quick light wipedown removes the settled dust that just accumulates."
5,Works great.,"I bought this product to save time and water. It works great, just as advertised. I would recommend it to others looking for a quick way to keep your car clean between washing."
4,Does the job.,Had a strong odor when I opened the package but that went away for the most part. The only odor left is that of the parafin impregnated into the fibers. I have owned these in the past and recommend them for show cars and weekend drivers. Not a bad idea to extend the wash cycle on every day drivers too. I purchased the kit with the large and small duster. I was a bit surprised to find the large one had a plastic handle rather the wood as shown. I do believe the plastic would be more durable and possibly lighter in weight. The small duster is perfect for the interior and tight exterior spots.
5,Works Great,There is no debate on this at all. For a quick way to remove dust and light dirt from your car use the California duster. Makes my black car shine great! Two thumbs up all the way!
5,Save a lot,"For the person who makes a lot of blank cds, you know how expensive blank cds can get. The only real way to get a bargain is to buy a quantity pack of 25, 50, or 100. With these large packs it only totals up to about $ a CD. Only problem is that they don't come with jewel cases. With this product you can buy a large pack of jewel cases and still have a bargain. This product is the way to go."
4,My husband loves this!,"My husband would watch this all day, everyday if he could. Great story for Michigan fans or big ten fans."
4,GO BLUE!,If your a Michigan fan then this is a must get for you!! I was too young when the Fab Five were around but this DVD did a great job of showing the realy story!
5,Very Well Done,"You expect a higher standard from ESPN and this one delivers. Well researched, the right questions were asked and answered. Lots of good personal thoughts from those who lived this story."
4,Good DVD,I ordered this for my brother for christmas and got it in time to give it to him. Thanks I love it! Great movie for a great price

4,An excellent home computer product,I have serched a long time for a microphone product that was an easy to use item as well as an out of the way one. I have been nothing but pleased with the performance of the product and am very pleased sound quality I get from it. I would recomend it for all home users.
1,Disappointment,"I bought this thinking that it create a left & plumb or a right & plumb laser line like my old Bulleseye that broke when it fell off an 8' step ladder (all my fault). Not so! This unit provides only a plumb line and a right-handed level line at the same time. Basically, that makes it good for half my jobs. It didn't matter since the unit arrived ""pre-broken"". There's another version of the Bullseye out there that does left or right from the same position. That's the one you want."
1,Buyer Beware,"I just returned this item because I could not get it to work. I called Black & Decker and after giving them the serial number, they told me the one I received was manufactured in 2004 and is no longer supported. I looked at the battery expiration date and it expired in 2009. If I'm going to buy something brand new, I would at least like it to be manufactured within this decade. Maybe it was a fluke but I didn't want to take the chance of getting another retired model."
4,Cass..,"I purchased this for myself, because my husband keeps the smaller B&D leveler hostage. Whilst, it is a nice leveler, I never expected it to be so big! I know my husband will steal this one and give me the smaller one (mission accomplished!)"
4,Solid laser level,"I bought this to hang new shelves in all my closets. It was a great time saver and made the job much easier. This is a pretty simple device to use and works great in drywall. My only complaint is the level line fades a bit over distance along the wall at times.Nice tool, though. I hope to be using it again on future projects. I would imagine it would be great for a new house."
4,Baby's First Vampire Cartoon Movie,"A cute approach to making introducing your small fry to the wonderful world of vampires. It will be interesting to see if this innoculates the little tykes when they upgrade to Lugosi, Langella, et al.

3,Doesn't work with an XBOX 360,It didn't work for me just because it pops out all the time and I have used it with two different consoles. When it's in place it works well.
5,madame esme rules,"EDUCATING ESME is a delightful book -- Esme Codell is fiery, smart, and honest with both herself and her students. I'm psyched that she's now a school librarian (we need more of those). Anyone who loved UP THE DOWN STAIRCASE will love EDUCATING ESME. I wish she was my teacher."
1,I guess there's a market for anything,"The fact that Esme has very creative ideas for the classroom is just great. However, the majority of pages in this book are devoted to her whining about the administrators, ranting about her colleagues and being alternately scared/disgusted/moved by her students. This is a journal by a young woman who, while very bright, seems to be incredibly vulgar and self-absorbed. She writes as if she is the only teacher on the face of the earth who ever had a creative thought. Since this is a journal and not a ""how-to"" book, it provides a glimpse into the thinking behind her actions. Not a pretty sight."
2,"Entertaining, but misses the mark","A student of mine recently loaned this book to me and asked me to read it. Having taught for 30+ years in various school systems, I found myself questioning portions of this book. I much prefer recommending books that are more realistic for my students to read. I am now a professor in the College of Education department at a university and I would like to give the same advice to other students of education and beginning teachers that I gave to my student - read the book for entertainment, yes, but ""take it with a grain of salt."" This book is best suited for the fiction shelves."
2,She said... Didn't hear from him,"I was assigned to read this book in an education class. It is an amusing read, but, like many others, I had some problems with it. The first is her smug, ""I'm wonderful and right and everyone else is a moron"" attitude. We've all known people like this, and their behaviors result in self-fullfilling prophecies because they just rub us the wrong way... over, and over, and over. What bothered me most, however, is that we only have HER account of what happened. I'd be really, REALLY interested in hearing Mr. Turner's (or any of the other teachers and administrators that the self-proclaimed ""Madame Esme"" unrelentingly disses) side of things. Like the country song states, ""We all live in a two-story house."""
5,In the eyes of a future teacher...,"In the eyes of a future teacher, ""this book was great!""I used to volunteer at a home for boys and I saw a lot of the same problems Esme had to face. This really showed me what types of things I can do if and when I face similar situations.It also really made me want to teach in an inner city school, or at least get involved in some type of social work, so we'll see what I end up doing...It also showed me how much I can and cannot do. I can't change the world or all my students lives, but I can have a slight impact on them, and will, as Esme said, have a bit of them always..."
3,Sadly this is required for my college of education,"I honestly do not see why this is dubbed so often as ""required reading"". This woman is completely full of herself and thinks that she was gods gift to teaching her first year. I also feel that a lot was exaggerated because there is no possible way her administration could be that ignorant and still be employed. Its a good read but you must take it with a grain of salt."
5,"Finally, a good book about teaching!","I am a school teacher and this is the most realistic book about the teaching experience I have ever come accross. Not many teachers would have the guts to publish their journal- especially not a ""warts-and-all"" journal, like this one. I laughed out loud while reading this book and passed it along to my co-workers."
5,SPECTACULAR BOOK!,"This book is magnificent.I suppose that many of the teachers who don't like the book perhaps don't understand her situation, but having taught in a school much like hers for 4 years, I can completely relate.This book is not only a must-read, but I predict many will read it several times."
4,Spunky and irreverent,"As a rookie substitute teacher, I was interested in perspectives from ""new"" full-time teachers on what I was getting into. Oh my! Esme is a riot - not only are her ideas hyper-creative (and adaptable, even in more 'stodgy' institutions), her story-telling was easy to read and left you wanting a sequel with more tales of her experiences. Not sure I'd want her working FOR me, but what fun she'd be to work WITH! Great read for anyone interested in the politics and progress possible in teaching."
4,Educating Esme:Diary of a Teacher's First Year,"Educating Esme writen by Esme codell is a first hand account of her teaching experience in a multi cultural school. Writen in diary form she takes you through the daily life of a teacher. From the first day of school to the last she shows you the problems she encounters in class and out of class.This diary paints a picture of Esmes personality and love for every thing she does. Esme style of writing is rather blunt due to it being a diary. At times it can be rather socking, but will always end up making you laugh."
2,Same old story,"Esme is witty and seems to be an exceptionally creative teacher, but the story she tells here is one we've heard before: bright and heroic teacher takes on idiotic and inept system. There is NO ONE in this book who seems to have a lick of sense outside of Esme and a couple of her students. All of the other characters are complete buffoons. I've taught for 16 years in an urban school system, and while I've seen my share of incompetent parents and educators, I have no illusions (as Esme seems to) that I'm the only one out here trying to do the right thing. If you're looking for light reading, this book might satisfy, but if you want a realistic look inside a school classroom, this isn't it."
3,Another teacher book,"I liked Esme' but found her a bit too quirky and outspoken to last long in a profession where criticism from the parents carries a great deal of weight. She has an engaging writing style and pulls the reader into her story, but I am concerned at the final message of annoyance that she brings to new teachers. Would more human relationships be better in the teaching profession?"
1,"Oh, please.","I never once got the idea that: A. anyone's ideas other than her own (or her somewhat warped mentor's)were interesting or creative or true, or B. she even LIKED teaching these children. And while many of her lessons and techniques were good, they weren't original, and credit might have been given to the books, university programs or educators from whence they came. I found this woman among the most boorish in print. There is much to be said about enthusiasm and the willingness to go the extra mile for your students, but there is also something attractive about a little humility. Esme Codell--at least in this book-- has none."
1,Tasteless,If you REALLY want to read a book about an EXCELLENT teacher (who is refreshingly modest) read MARVA COLLINS' WAY. Marva teaches values that any parent would agree with (Marva would NEVER stoop to rewarding extortion OR offering to s--k a boy's d--k in the boy's restroom no matter WHAT the circumstances). I didn't like this book because it seems as though the author is trying to say that ANY method of teaching or relating to the student is OK as long as the student learns SOMETHING (Learn what?--is the question!). I simply don't agree. I believe teachers should be role-models with high standards and refined character. This just isn't it.
2,A review from a student teacher.,"I was told I had to read this book for an education class. Although I am an avid reader and usually enjoy reading, I did not like this book. In all of my training, I have been told to try to get along with my fellow teachers and my administration. I guess she did not learn this lesson."
1,Parents Beware,"Parents Beware!!! This book is not for those under age 18. It contains vulgar language, profanity and sexual content.While some of Ms. Cordell's actions are commendable, the vulgar language in the book made it dificult for me to focus on any good. I disliked the book intensely."
5,Educating Esme is a great book!!,"I have read this book over and over again...I LOVE it!! So many good ideas for teachers, and it is so entertaining. I highly recommend :)"
5,She's right about what's wrong in Chicago,"I am also a Chicago Public Schools teacher and I couldn't have said it better myself. Madame Esme brings up so many of the problems that our students face, like poverty, broken homes, lack of parental involvement, etc., and how they seep into the classroom. She also writes about her inept administrators. Sadly, I can relate. I really enjoyed the part where she makes her ""worst"" student the teacher for the day. She in turn takes his place as the trouble-maker. LOVED IT! I have bought this book for other teachers and I re-read my copy all the time, especially after a hard day in the trenches."
4,Learn Something New,"Esme Raji Codell's biography tells of her first year teaching at a rural, public school, where her class of fifth grade students cannot read, write well, or behave properly. The book is further proof that you learn something new everyday. Esme does not just teach her students, but also learns many of life's lessons from each and every one of them. Join Esme and her class for a year of experiences that has forever changed her life."
5,"a hilarious, sad, and idea-filled account of teaching","The author captured it all--the joy, the pain, the ups and downs--of teaching. After teaching many years, I still found lots of ideas that I can use in my classroom. Presented entertainingly, but still telling it just the way it really is, this account of a first year should be read by all teachers before they teach. I laughed aloud, but tears were in my throat in other parts. Educating Esme is my new favorite book!"
1,Save Your Money,"I just didn't find this book ""close to reality"". It seems a bit too Mary Poppinsish. If you're looking for ""real life"", I suggest you go elsewhere."
2,"Coy, Over-Sweetened, and Self-Serving","Codell's book has a lot of fictional anecdotes. She claims to have told off Principals and other administrators, which no teacher could ever do without getting in massive trouble. I think that what she's done is present an idealised version of the truth, and the truth is that her first year couln't have been as sucessfull as she claims it was.I agree that the Principal had few good qualities, but the book is damaged by her anger, which seeps through. She continues to rail at the Principal, long after she's made her point.On a last note, I don't sympathise with her complaint about the Principal ""starring"" at her body. Any teacher who wears a skin-tight leotard to school is probably suffering from dementia."
5,Great book!,"All beginning teachers should purchase this book! Not only was it fun and interesting, but it has great ideas for your classroom."
5,Excellent Read for Teachers,"Educating Esme is a fabulous book for all teachers. It tells of Esme' first year of teaching experience. Esme is faced with the challenge of educating low performing students in an inner city school. She describes the many challenges that take place in her classroom. Esme' also provides an inside look into the stragegies that she used to motivate and teach her students.Teaching respect and honor to low performing students was just a portion of Esme's teaching skills. She challenges her students to perform and in the end, they perform better than anyone ever expected them to. This book is inspiring, funny, and sad in many ways. Esme's stubborn nature and wit gave her the ability to survive and never give up on these problematic students. If you need inspiration, I recommend this book to lift your spirits and make you laugh. Esme' also has many teaching secrets to share with her audience.Brenda Jones (author of ""Standing Up"" and ""No I Don't Want to Play Today""Standing Up"
3,OK...,"I recently read through the book and found it interesting, although not ""exceptional"". If this is the definition of an ""exceptional"" teacher then I work with exceptional teachers every day. Granted, there are some that are not adequate, but most do the same (or similar) things mentioned in this book. This year was my first year to teach and while there are many challenges in teaching (as mentioned in this book), most teachers do rise to the challenge and are very creative. I thought the book was just an inside view of what goes on pretty much regularly in any school."
3,Hard to believe -- a whole year with NO self doubt?,"...She never doubts herself or her abilities and the kids never make her cry or feel like she's about to lose it -- all pretty much staples of the first year teaching experience. She never faces any difficulty planning activities and didn't seem to have to even think about educational objectives.On the other hand, she seems to genuinely care about the kids and did some awfully creative things. I am surprised, I suppose, that she became a librarian."
3,A delightful tidbit,"I've taught for 12 years and am interested in anyone's take on this challenging profession. I read this book quickly, like a bon-bon. It was enjoyable but gave me no lasting impression. In our state, ""The One Hundred Dresses"" is required reading for third grade and I'd rather read it than this book. She reminded me of the countless first year teachers I would see every year. Sparkling in September and swooning and gone in June."
1,Even Worse than Ally,"Codell is a naive, egotistical teacher who happens to be a good story teller. This a book I would only suggest to a reader who wanted a SIMPLE thing to read while drinking on a train. This story is an insult to all new and old educators. She is not at all critical of herself....Isn`t it ironic that Esme no longer teachers full time? If I didn`t hate teaching I, too, would have written a book and lived of the proceeds. Can you say ""Good Publisher? ""Unlike what Esme likes to beleive she has no answers to the dilemmas that are present in the eductional system. However America does need a hero.....preferably a good looking one."
2,Nothing is Left,"This book was an interesting read if you want someone who is going to praise herself and narly condemn everyone else in her school. If you take away the vulgar language, confrontations with authority, and her constant praising herself then you are left with an epilogue written by Jim Trelease. MOst entertaining part of the book was the afterward she wrote."
2,boy is she conceeded,"This book is mildly entertaining, but Esme is so conceeded throughout the book that I couldn't take anything she wrote seriously."
1,Wonderful portrait of what it's NOT like teaching!,"I am a teacher. I teach in the public school system. I am not ""old-fashioned"" because this is only my second year to teach. I saw very little that was redeeming in this book. This is a portrait of schools as dens of iniquity with teachers contributing to the delinquency of minors. If that's the ""new"" way to teach, leave me out! I was absolutely turned off by the whole book. This is NOT what it's like teaching in public schools and it is NOT representative of all teachers' feelings or views. I would hate to think that someone that is not a teacher would think that we all behave and/or think this way. We don't! I, personally, cannot figure out why the book was even written and published. This book gives teachers a bad name and I hope that readers will realize that we all aren't this way. Some of us DO have standards and morals. I hated this book and am sorry I wasted my money on it."
5,Inspiration to get me to teach again,"A simply written diary that is absolutely touching and informative. I plan to have a copy of it with me at all times when I return to teaching after a 2 year break. She may not be the best teacher in the world but she'd be my choice for my kids - the true litmus test, as Madame says!"
5,I want to be in Madame Esme's class!,"A very powerful account of a brave, wise, and funny first-year teacher. I loved the ferocity with which she took on the administration--and I wished I could be one of her students! This book is incredibly moving and I hated to know it was going to end. Long live Madame Esme!"
5,A Must for Anyone in the Education Field,"This is the most amazing book. It was required reading for an education course I took, and I have read it about 10 times since then. Esme is honest and has wonderful ideas and philosophies. I love how she stands up to the administration! All this and she's only a first year teacher!"
1,Depressing sync problems for sure,"I got this blu ray as a gift. I originally recorded it on my DVR off of the Palladium channel. The palladium version is perfect. My Blu Ray is flawed. The audio is out of sync with the video, BIG TIME!! This is not the case with my other concert blu rays and I have many. My equipmentr is top of the line too. These other customer complaints are spot on. FIX IT!!!!!!!!!!I don't feel good."
2,"How could they screw this up...buy the DVD, not blu-ray","First time reviewer, that should tell you everything you need to know...Wow, I had read the reviews and was hoping the sound glitch problem had been fixed. It has not!! Received my pre-ordered Blu-Ray disc. The people who manufactured this Blu-Ray should be embarrassed. Bottom line is now I have to order the DVD. The picture,sound and quality are amazing, especially compared to the VH1 special I recorded of this concert. But dont make the same mistake I did, purchase the DVD and not the Blu-Ray. Just trust me (and the other reviews that mention this, it cant be stressed enough)..."
1,Disappointed,"This Blue ray is horrible. I downloaded the latest update from my ps3 and still the same issue. I was very fortunate to take it back to best buy. They gave me the same one but it was unopened. So the next day I took it back unopened. They told me since its not opened that I can exchange it for something else. I ended up getting AC/DC Let There Be Rock. Until they reissue this blue ray, then I will be most happy to purchase it. The Manufacturer of this Nirvana blue ray release should be ashamed. We pay good money, so give us good product!"
2,blu ray stinks,"Just echoing the statements of many......the BLU Ray is out of sync. Statements from Geffen and Universal are wrong. It is the disc....not the players.Do not buy the Blu Ray, get the DVD because sync is fine.I have played many many Blu Rays on my player never with any sync issues.....but this one is all messed up.Visually and Audio wise this is a stunning product....but the sync issues are a killer. The quality difference of the Blu Ray is meaningless when things are out of sync so do yourself a huge favour and just buy the DVD. Plus the DVD has extras and the Blu Ray doesn't/"
5,Brilliant,This band is it. Without them I would have dug a grave because of the shit music in the 90's. I miss Kurt. He was an amazing person.
5,Great Concert Film,I am not a big Nirvana fan but I do appreciate their music. I bought it for a friend for his birthday. He watches it over and over. I guess it is good?
5,Concert DVD,The Concert DVD has great clarity.My boyfriend loved the DVD as his Christmas gift!The shipment came in right on time. :)I would purchase from them again!
5,memorable!,verlos en cine es como tenerlos ahí. De los muchos conciertos que la rompieron. Material insuperable. Gracias por todo NIRVANA. Todavía con el espíritu adolescente ando.
1,Great Video and Sound - BUT DON'T BUY YET .... sound is out of sync,The bluray video smokes the DVD ... no question. Problem is that the sound is out of sync with the video!... Very bad with earlier tracks and very obvious.Hope they fix this asap.
2,Defective Disc,"Five Stars for the show itself.Zero Stars for the defective audio/video sync.This is an amazing document of Nirvana at the top of their game, but there are serious sync issues with the disc itself. The disc falls out of sync within 10 minutes of playback. Please recall these discs and reissue for the five stars that Nirvana deserves!"
3,Enthusiast Shop Manual,"What complete service manual does not have electrical schematics? I'll tell you! This one! If you intend to work on this car, buy the Haynes manual."
4,A Miata owner from Barbados says....,"A well written, clear and concise book with plenty of pictures to help you do what you want to do to the car. It covers everything from all of the standard distance / time maintenance jobs that should be done, through to the more complicated in a language that makes it easy for the novice and the expert.I bought this book over a year ago and still use it every time I go to do something to the car! If you want to do jobs your self, and need a bit of help, get this book!"
4,Pretty good for a workshop manual,"Not perfect, but workshop manuals usually aren't. A bit too ""British"" for Americans, but the information and pictures are first rate and it can get you through most do-it-yourself overhauls and repairs."
4,Very Informative and Easy reading . . .,"I want to hear others' opinions . . . e-mail at ""thankavet@angelfire.com"""
1,FILE THIS BOOK UNDER FICTION,"As much as I appreciate the intent of their book, social workers have no place in the political process -- and, other than as citizens, they shouldn't. Social work is not a profession. Social workers have sold their souls to becomes second-rate psychotherapists. Their advocacy days are long over. Schools of social work pay lip service to social justice issues (in fact, social work organizations have not been able to define the word ""justice,"" much to their collective embarrassment. Social workers should just get back to case management and leave the other work they attempt to lawyers, policy analysts, and well-educated psychologists. (Of course, I'm a Columbia U. Schl. of Social Wk. grad, the most unjust school imaginable, so I'm knowledgeable and bitter)"
3,"good collection, should be revised","i like this book, especially the brief analysis of each solo, but i would urge anyone using it to learn licks to take the book as a ""suggestion"", get some transcribing software, and do your own transcriptions, or at least do some note checking. there are plenty of mistakes in these books, i have seen, and sometimes it can obscure the logic of certain licks and how they must've been executed. i am thinking specifically of the bright size life solo. these books are fine for casual study, though."
1,Something seriously wrong with this model,"I bought two of these units at Radio Shack to use for installing security surveillance cameras in properly aiming/focusing the cameras. I was quite literally on the rooftop for about 15 minutes, and had used a total of approximately 8 minutes of talk time when the first unit chewed through its batteries. Mine was then of course useless, but I used it the next day and installed fresh batteries into the other unit.After about 10 minutes of talk time, these things chew through EVERY ounce of battery power. I assumed I had gotten bad batteries somehow, and tried new ones to no avail.I logged into Amazon to see about getting a higher quality business band type radio and ran across the comment left by another here, and had to put my two cents in. I feel that these units are defective and strongly advise thinking twice about this purchase."
1,Battery life is laughable,"The batteries will last maybe 5 minutes. These radios are worthless. Why did Uniden even bother making them? I think with only a little more time and effort, they could have solved this problem and had a decent product. It's not like they were pioneering new technology."
3,"Beautiful language, disappointing book","I bought this Romansh-English Dictionary and Phrasebook out of the hope to better understand and translate some quotes and letters that are in my possession from my trip to Grisons in Switzerland. To my utter disappointment, almost every word I tried to look up, wasn't shown in this book. There are only 77 pages dedicated to the dictionary section in this small book (consider that a common Spanish-English dictionary has over 400 pages). This is the only Romansh-English dictionary published that I know of, which is very sad considering what a beautiful and rare language it is and that it should be better protected. All this being said, after looking over this book again, it does have some useful basic information about the language and common phrases that are used. But, overall, very disappointing."
5,"Very Insightful, It saved my life","First of all I think that the members of the Watchtower Bible and Tract Society(a.k.a Jehovah's Witnesses) should read this book before giving it a review. Second of all after reading this book it helped me to realize that as a Jehovah's Witness I had been putting my life in danger not only in a spiritual way but in a physical way as well. I almost died a year ago from a ruptured cyst in my abdomen because I was bleeding internally from it. Thankfully a week before I had the emergency surgery I had read this life-saving book. I realized that I wasn't abstaining from blood because of a religious belief, but rather like the author clearly shows, I was doing merely what I was told by the Society that I should do based strictly on their interpretation of a certain passage of scripture was. Much thanks to the author for saving my life."
1,this book lies,i would give 0 but i cant this book is not true there is ton of othere ways instead of blood to save you life there are tons of people that die BECAUSE of blood tranfuison
4,Not what I thought it was,I thought this book was about the many deaths concerning blood transfusions. They are more or less inserted small paragraphs. This book is about the presidents of the Watchtower Society.
1,I wanted to give it no stars but that wasn't a choice.,"The blood transfusion issue is not something that some man thought up. It clearly states three times in the bible that Jehovah tells Noah that animals may now serve as food for them but the blood is sacred and should not be consumed. The second is in Leviticus Christians as his chosen people because the Jews refused to believe that that people should ""abstain"" from blood. To me, abstaining means not to take blood into the body in any manner, shape or form."
1,So bad it hurts!,"I received this camera free with an order for Christmas cards for my company. I consider it a downgrade from not having a camera at all. Upon removing it from the box it was so poorly made it has nearly no weight at all and everything is CHEAP plastic. I installed the 2 double A batteries (which quadrupled the original weight) and took a few pics. Extremely unresponsive. This is slower then a Canon 4mp digital camera I had used in the late 90's. Very poor image quality. I blew up the image in photoshop and looked at the pixels...they are blurry and undefined. No, it's not due to camera shake, the flash was on so the shutter should be very fast. Please don't EVER spend money on this camera. It's so bad it hurts. By the way, I boxed it back up and plan on giving it away. Anybody want it?"
2,Menue is impossible to use!,"We have had this camera for two or three years. The pictures are fine. But we have misplaced the Owner's Manual, and can't get a new one on-line. The Vivitar site does not list the VivCam 6150S. It's like it doesn't exist. The Vitar home page and support page do not divulge any information. When I enter the model no. (V6150) the response is there is no such product. I guess Vivatar has give up on this product. I had to put the camera card in a Canon camera, erase the card, and put it back in the Vivitar. I would not buy another product from a company that does not provide a manual on-line. So, I would not buy another Viviat product. Oh, by the way, when I called the support phone number, I was left hanging for 20 minutes, and gave up!"
1,aful,"she need some one to show how to be a leader on all level she need level 1,2 and 3 Victoria really, you need to make no more workout it not just about you you supose to show people how to work out not just jump into it, like people know and this there first time playing your tape."
2,Not what I was looking for.,"I didVictoria Johnson: Power Shaping, Vol. 2I did not like this workout. I find it very boring."
4,these tales have no borders,"It doesn't matter what country your from, these tales are classic. Sure there's a lot of cultural lingo in these, but nothing to the point that brings the reader into a state of confusion. Basically it's easy to understand the essence of the tales. A delightful read, you'll laugh, and you'll probably learn something too."
4,Excellent collection......,"This is the book I got my hands onto from a person who is not an Indian origin. Being an Indian, I'd say that this is the very good collection of stories from India from all different states/languages compiled in simple to understand english."
5,Folktales from India,My daughter really enjoyed this book. She loves reading about different cultures and especially folktales from different lands.I would recommend this book.
5,Folktales from India by Ramanvjan,"There are approximately 110 tales told in 22 languages.The stories range from the comic to allegories and romanticsequences. For instance, there is a tale entitled ""A Friendin Need"". It relates the friendship between a tortoise anda fox. A leopard visits and tosses the tortoise back intothe water. Another tale relates the best of flowers.According to Birbal, clothing is the product of flowers.A tale on non-violence describes a holy man asking a snaketo cease biting things although hissing is acceptable.The stories enunciate themes which are not commonto the subtle English humor handed down over the centuries.The acquisition is valuable as a potential conversation piece."
1,Save your money,"I thought this book would provide more insight on kitchen appliances and ways to downsize but cook different meals. The recipes were awful in my opinion and I would not want to eat them even at home, much less on the open road. A few good hints but not at the price of buying the book brand new."
3,"Not bad, but relies too much on canned food","I got this at the library hoping to find some interesting recipes and tips that I could use while car camping, or while staying at a base camp with more amenities than you have while backpacking. While having some interesting recipes, this book was definitely into using canned/frozen and convenience foods.Yes, I know you can pack a lot of stuff into an RV, but that doesn't mean you should. The biggest benefit is having the refrigerator to keep perishables such as fruits and vegetables in, and few recipes mentioned using fresh anything. Considering that you can even get lots of fruits and veggies pre-cut and bagged in most grocery stores/warehouse stores fairly inexpensively, this book reads as if it were written in the '50s or 60's with all the casserole add-a-can-of-cream-soup recipes.Borrow from your library first before buying."
1,Don't Buy It,"I'm glad I checked this out at the library before buying, because it saved me ten bucks. The recipes are dated---most resort to using canned, processed and high sodium shelf foods as shortcuts. Out of the entire book, I only found three recipes I would try. The rest sounded not only unhealthy, but lousy-tasting! Ugh!"
5,Lawnboy As Usual Excellent,Have used it now for about 4 years and its still running great. 1 pull to start. Lawnboy was always my favorite. Love the Green. The self propelled part is a little slower than I would like. You can go as slow as you like but not all that fast. Great machine. Free shipping! Yea!
3,3 Stars for dying on its 3rd year!,I have mixed feeling about this mower. Now I have to shop for another one. Engine won't start at all after doing all the checklist of troubleshooting!
3,Great Mower but never factory checked- failed out of box,"Mower arrived in average condition (at least compared to other reviews). I was all prepared to put it together, but wouldn't you know it, it was fully assembled. Just raise the handle, set wheel height and add oil and gas(the oil and gas are separate now). Now for the fun part, the mower wouldn't start because the mower blade was hitting on a black piece of plastic under the deck. I don't know the purpose of this piece but it is riveted in and per the manual is part of the mower. I filed enough off to allow the blade to make it by. No more problems. I would recommend buying one from the store, as your on your own if you buy on line."
4,A fear supressor!,"Writing From the Body combats the fears, self-imposed standards, and suppressed feelings that block writers' creative potential. It frees those feelings and teaches writers how to use them productively. If you can extinguish the flames of self-criticism, you can ignite your soul's creativity"
5,This Book Covers All Bases.Buy it!,"I am on my second reading of John Lee's book ""Writing from the Body"". I am discovering things about myself that have enabled me to get in touch with my feelings and my body (and some that are still hindering me from writing at my best) I am sure that when I read it for a third time I will find out even more about myself and why I am unable at times to write as well as I should."
1,No quick fixes.,"This man sounds sexist. He wants to blame over-emotional mothers for the problems with children. If we all parented as men there would be no trouble, he seems to say. He offers his quick-fix list of rules, but declines to give them a foundation of love and the values of the family. I predict that children raised under his edicts will grow up to rebel, big-time, against their autocratic parents. ""Because I said so,"" may sometimes indeed be the end of the discussion, but not before the child is told the reason for the parent's decision. I do agree with some of his ideas, but I think he builds a very bare house that will wash away without an adequate foundation of love and respect within the family."
2,Some good advice hidden amongst the muck,"There are some decent ideas in this book, but it is buried amongst a lot of misguided conceptions about childhood and very little in-depth research. In fact, most of Rosemond's theories are based on how he survived his childhood, which isn't one I'd like to model (the way his grandmother and mother raised him is not impressive). Because he turned out OK, he suggests all parents ignore their children, put themselves first, and only buy toys that were made in the 1950s. Please! If you can get past his lack of passion for children, there are some morsels that make sense, such as: a strong marriage forms the basis of a strong family life, so don't ignore your partner once you have kids. I prefer authors and experts who base their ""expertise"" on a few more facts (he'll quote one study and act like that makes his viewpoint absolute). If you want great practical advise from someone who seems to really love children, read Kid Cooperation by Elizabeth Pantley."
4,Some pretty good advice,"This book was easy to read and I thought it contained some very good advice. I did not always agree with John Rosemond but I still enjoyed the book and will reference it many times in the future, I'm sure. It has good advice about consistent discipline and reassures parents that it is okay for children to dislike your decisions at times. A parent who never makes decisions his or her children don't like is not doing his job correctly. I also enjoyed the advice about toys (no, it isn't necessary to buy a child every new toy that hits the shelf) and limiting television viewing (yes, too much is unhealthy)."
1,Wrong Game,"I ordered this copy of Fallout2 because it pictured the US version, not the UK version which has some content removed. Upon receiving it I saw the 16+ rating instead of mature and figured they sent me the wrong one. Upon reading the readme after installing I found out it definitely was the UK version. So, do not expect to get the US version, you will be disappointed."
1,BIG LET DOWN,"I have Played Fallout 3 and all five add ons. Thought I would go back and play this one. This was a major disappointment. The graphics took me back to my days gaming on the Commodore 64/128. It was so bad, I messed with it for about 5 minutes and said enough. There was absolutely nothing to like about the thing. The controls aren't all that good either. This probably would have been good back when, but in these days, it is too dated and not worth the time. Oh well, there is Fallout: New Vegas to look forward to."
4,Heard the difference right away,"Although we have a pretty decent sound system at our church, as soon as my lips hit this mic I could instantly hear the difference. By hearing the crispness and clarity, it encouraged me to be more creative."
5,Sennheiser e945 Supercardioid Dynamic Handheld Mic,AWESOME MIC!!! I HAVE OTHER SENNHEISER AND ONLY USE THEM FOR RECORDING AND STAGE USE.I HIGHLY RECOMMEND HIGH STURDY HEAVY QUALITY MIC!!!BUY A SENNHEISER!!!
3,"Good, but not great","This calendar was given to me when I was pregnant with my son. It's okay; I like the stickers that came with it; I love the fact that you it has a space for a 4x6 picture in each month. But, it's a 1st year calendar, and it has stickers for ""I was born"" all the way to ""my first birthday"", and it only has 12 months available. If you start the calendar the day the baby is born (the way you're supposed to), you run out of months and the last month you can chart on is month 11. So you don't even get to put a picture of them at 1 or even use your ""my first birthday"" sticker. This irritated me, but I didn't realize it until I was almost at the end of his 1st year. I've seen better calendars out there."
3,Font choice,"I'm impressed with the number of 5-star reviews, but when I checked the table of contents and chapter previews, I was put off by the font. It's legible, but not readable for any length of time. It's a curious rhetorical choice--I wonder what the publisher hoped to convey with the ""handwritten"" style of font. I'm sure I'd enjoy and appreciate the contents, but I simply can't imagine reading it. Too bad."
5,Outstanding Book that We Should All Read,This is a great book for anyone and it is one of my favorites. It helped me to grow and grow up. I strongly recommend it. I gave a copy to my daughter after I read it. Quick read and very helpful.
5,RECOMMENDING IT TO MY CLIENTS!,"Cheri Huber has put into a clear, understandable book everything I've been trying to teach my psychotherapy clients. It's one of the books I've been recommending on a regular basis ever since I read it. It includes terrific information and motivational, workable suggestions for letting go of your destructive, self-limiting inner dialogue. Pamela D. Blair, Author The Next Fifty Years: A Guide for Women at Mid-Life And Beyond"
5,Great product.,"Bought 5 of these to equip our new home with detached garage. They're perfectly well suited to the task, and far better priced than others."
2,second-rate,"The acting, story-lines,images and editing for this series are second-rate......spend your $$$$$ and time on series such as Silent Witness, Waking the Dead, Foyle's War or Dexter. Maria Wern has all the charm of a washcloth. I wasted my $$$ on this.......such is life."
4,Well crafted Swedish mystery series,"Erudite and beautifully filmed on a scenic island, the Maria Wern TV series is well worth watching if you enjoy PBS mysteries and similar fare."
4,Very good but not great,"It's fun to see another part of Sweden, the island of Gotland. The stories are quite engaging but a little predicable if you have watched many detective shows. I do get a little tired of the police officers' children being put at risk. The acting is excellent."
4,nice book,it is a very nice book but i would think they could've done a better job .. still my daughter likes the pictures on it!
3,It does clean,This product does clean fingerprints and stains succesfully but dont expect much from the very fragile plastic device since it starts cracking and getting loose very soon. Not for removing heavy stains or scratches.
2,Maybe if it didn't immediately break...,"This may not be new information, but this product is extremely fragile. I used it once before it broke. There's a plastic ring that keeps the cleaning wheel in position so it can latch onto the gears and spin. Immediately after I used it the first time, the ring came off, so the cleaning wheel fell on the disc and scratched it (which was a bit counterproductive as I had purchased this to improve the performance of my CDs). I tried sticking the ring back on, but everything I used to get it to stay blocked the wheel from spinning. Now, if I hold it in just the right angle, I can get my CDs in without the wheel falling off, or the disc falling off the base. Which was good for a few more cleanings. But then it stopped cleaning the outside edge of the discs. The middle part cleans fine, but it doesn't seem to touch the edge at all. So much for clean, shiny discs that work properly."
3,Barely adequate and not very effective for long,"After using about 5 times, whereas it seemed to do a decent job of cleaning, the cleaning fluid started leaving residue around the outside edges of the disc. Finger smudges were left as well in the same area. This was after following the directions of spraying the disc two times and rotating 20 times. Seems like the cleaning pad was no longer making contact with the outside edge of the disc. Don't think this is a very good product."
2,Never used,Not what I thought it was when I purchased it. Was hoping it was a disc player cleaner versus a disc cleaner. Still in plastic never used.
3,Works about as good as eyeglass wipes,"Works OK for general disk cleanng, but so do regualr disposible optical wipes. Optical wipes are easier and cheaper to use."
3,PROCEED WITH CAUTION,I GUESS I HAVE THE SAME COMPLAINT AS A FEW OTHERS. AFTER 20 OR SO USES THE LITTLE PAD CAME OFF OF THE OTHER PAD NOW AFRAID TO USE IT FOR FEAR OF DAMAGING DISKS WOULD NOT RECOMMEND
2,Falls Apart,"After just a few uses, the cleaning ring on this product fell off it's mount and had to be glued back. Pretty ironic that Scotch can't make a product that remains stuck together."
5,Scotch Disc Cleaner for CD/CD Rom's and DVD ...,it came when they said it would - the product is great!
1,I expected much more from the Audio Tape,"In the audio tape, the reader tells stories of Marvin the old style manager. The stories are so contrived that they get in the way of the message. I have found myself stuggling to want to hear the second half of the tape.Empowered employees are powerful, but I don't expect to be belittled by the goofy stories told in this tape. It's not the readers fault, the material is weak. The book may present a better approach, but I would recomment you look somewhere else for information on empowering employees."
3,OK toning workout,"This workout was just OK. I was disappointed b/c the description says it's a toning and cardio workout, and it's not. It's 99% toning. She adds a few moves during the last 5 minutes to get your heart rate up (i.e. burpees and jumping lunges). I also did not think there would be so much floorwork. The majority of the workout was done lying down. This workout just didn't do it for me. I gave it 3 stars b/c the instructor is like-able."
1,Not a good Book,Mr. Wallace has put one million lines of code with only ten lines of explanation. I think it would be better if you use smaller examples with smaller segments of code to demonstrate ideas and techniques.
2,Beautiful melodies!,"This installation in the Discotheque series brings again the heavy weights of 70's guinean Music, Balla(""Sakodougou"",""Moi ca ma fout""), Keletigui (""JRDA"",""La bicycletta""), Virtuoses Diabate (""Sankaranka""' ""Nadiaba""), Bembeya (""Mborin"", ""Dagna"") along with Bafing Jazz of Mamou ( ""Toubaka"",""Sontilla"") and the South African megastar Myriam Makeba (""Solo Quintette""). The music is thoroughly enjoyable throughout this great Album!"
2,Bad quality,Returned the item. The quality was bad. I couldn't forward to another part of the movie. I was just taken to the end to some advertisement.
2,pros and cons,I bought this model to save a few bucks and wish I hadn't. I used to have a nice Senco finish gun that disappeared. This replacement has got some similarities but three things bother me already. You can't change nail lengths without a bit of effort and a small prying tool; it is not oil free; and the bumper on the tip is black and leaves marks all over the wood. When will they stop making these black bumpers and switch to the clear scilicone ones. I should have spent the extra $49.
3,ok for the price,"I just bought this piece the FinishPro 35 in a three piece combo pack from Home Depot. The set also included the FinishPro 15 brad nailer & the SLS15 stapler. The comdo pack with tax cost about $164, that is about $55 per nailer.I did have to call the Senco 1-800# to figure out how to change out the nails on the FinishPro 35.To me it is not very user frinedly but does not require a small pry tool as per one of the other reviews.The FinishPro 35 does seem heavy compared to the DeWalt D51275K but that unit runs $179.For the price this 3 piece combo seemed a bargin.Time will tell."
4,Needs Polishing,"Overall, this is a reasonably useful set of books. The books can be used both as general reference and as study guides for the OCP exams. There are several errors, especially in volume 1, OCP Introduction to Oracle9i: SQL Exam Guide. I recommend downloading the errata for volume 1 and marking the changes before you start reading. Also, I suggest you run through all the examples and verify the answers given in the books. I found a few errors that the errata didn't catch. These books are a nice place to start for test preparation, but don't rely on them as your only test preparation guide. I found the questions on the tests to be much more difficult than the practice questions in these books."
3,Unsatisfying,"This collection looks like a good deal with its bundled pricing, 2000+ pages and CD ROMs, but there are problems that make it not such a good deal.Each of the books have factual and typographical errors, and the material is so poorly written that it's nearly impossible to use any of them to study for the OCP exam. Also this set is NOT for DBAs on the job. Looking up information is difficult, and trusting what you do read is a barrier since I counted hundreds of ""facts"" that I disagreed with in the books.Pass this set up."
2,Does not truly prepare you for the test!,"Since I already passed the SQL test without this book I started with Fundamentals I. I studied by installing and using Oracle 9i on my home machine. After taking and failing this test, I can see why. This book is a POOOOOOOR guide. I am now looking into Oracle User Groups and other non-expensive testing options..."
3,Read the Oracle online documentation,"I passed the OCP, but I found the Oracle online documentation is way more useful than any of the books in this set, plus it's free.Anyway, I did not read the first book, thus no comment.The Fundamental I and Performance book are all right. As pointed by other reviews, plenty of editing errors.The Fundamental II is a dump. The author cannot express himself in clear unstandable English. The part of the book that I can understand are copied directly from online documentation.I would definitely NOT recommend buying the whole set."
3,Failed OCP test 1 (SQL),"I was too dependent on the books to pass my OCP test and I failed my first test. What I can say is that the book goes into areas not mentioned in the test and the predominant area the test focused on...actual interpretation of SQL code, the text lacked coverage in sufficient detail. Also, if you don't know what iSQL is before the test, I'd suggest you learn what it is and how/when to use it BEFORE taking the test.Cheers,Stephen"
2,Be forewarned,"This books has errors, many of which have not been corrected at the Osborne web site. I agree with another reviewer - get the errata before you start and check the answers if something does not look right.Also, some of the wording in the text and examples was confusing (like the feeling of reading something with a triple negative in it). I guess it's a relatively ok kick-start for the exams but do not rely on it solely.I am getting the Sybex set in addition to this set. I am also considering on getting 3 month access to Database Domain documentation for Oracle and some self test practice exams(Whizlabs, Database Domain, Cert21 to name a few). Check out Certification Magazine online (www.....com) for a more extensive listing of possible vendors of practice exams.Hope this helps!"
5,beautiful!,"Very nice, high quality music. We enjoy collecting music from around the world to both listen to at home and in the classroom. This is one of my favorites so far."
4,"Extraordinary, Balanced and Timeless.","What more can be said about recordings that I listen to over and over again without ever tiring? Nordisk Sang was the fire that ignited me to further pursue additional Norwegian recordings, such as The Sweet Sunny North series. It's like your standard blue blazer; the essential and first cornerstone of everything else that follows."
4,Interesting and diverse recording.,"This is a great offering of traditional Norwegian songs in various settings from solo flute to voice with synthesizers. Hardanger fiddle and non-tempered organ seem to run the gamut of possibilities. Production is good, but the real value lies in the songs themselves."
5,Watching her fly...,"One of the other reviews really disappointed me because I am a big fan of Christina Muir and Hot Soup. I love their music and their group. I don't understand how anybody could think this about this music, maybe because I love it!!! I own many copies of Christina's music! I am watching her fly... Feet First! I would rate this CD a 10 out of 5 if that was available. In this CD there are many different types of songs, including harmonies, some very relaxing, and others very energetic... etc. Christina, please come out with more CD's!!"
2,Some artists should just keep a diary.,"With bland, second-hand music that makes one cringe, I barely made it through this disc. Muir wouldn't know passion or soul if it scooped her up at high tide. I was disappointed, because I am a fan of Hot Soup, and this kind of music in general. But the songs are banal and the performances are trendy. You wonder why artists like this can't just keep a diary (with a lock on it!)."
4,Overall a super fun game for preschoolers,Bought for my five year old daughter and she LOVES the game. The loading can be a little slow but it didn't seem to phase her. Each game easy to navigate where I could leave her on the computer by herself and she did each game without needing my help. I have Windows XP and have to start game twice in 800x600 color screen mode but it DOES WORK. I've read of many problems with game but once I got that down we know what to do. I would recommend this game to any parent who wants to introduce your preschooler to the fun world of computer games!!
3,Photoshopped?,"I tried to select a tropical poster that was an actual photograph, without being airbrushed. Thought I had picked one, but once I unrolled it, you can see where the image has been tidied up. For the price, not a big deal."
3,Wheelock's Kindle Edition Errors and page numbers,"I have both the printed and e editions of this book. I take the Kindle version to class on my ipad and drag it along on the subway to work on while travelling. Without the printed version at home, however, I would be lost. In Kindle flipping back and forth between the glossary, previous chapters and what you are working on is difficult, but not impossible. A better way to do this would be helpful. Also, for books that are textbooks, leaving the original pagination in place would be extremely helpful, as the prof refers to the page numbers in the printed version and Kindle's location reference is useless. The Kindle version also needs a thorough proof reading, as I am finding many errors. Again if you are relying solely on the Kindle version, this could pose a problem.As to how good this book is for learning Latin, I am only 5 chapters in and can therefore not really give an opinion. I can say, so far so good."
3,"Good academic text, but tediously written","Hey, it's Latin...not much else can be said. This is still a great book on the subject, and it arrived in great condition. I appreciate the seller getting it to me fast."
4,Wheelock's Latin,"This is one of the best Latin books out there. It is best used in the classroom as opposed to a self taught method. I have used it at both the highschool and college level. Many of the lessons are based on original Latin works. Like any language, a good knowledge of English grammer is helpful but there is a book called English grammer for Latin students."
1,Amazon.com SUCKS!,"The book is not easy to understand.Amazon.com backordered another order of mine without notifying me. Then, a day after I cancelled my order, they placed a pending charge on my Visa check card, overdrawing my account because I had to buy the book elsewhere. CUSTOMER SERVICE AT AMAZON.COM SUCKS!!!"
5,Wonderful,"I bought this book to refresh my Latin knowledge so I could place higher in college classes, and was very pleased. Over the summer I did an exercise every day, and probably spared myself a year of Latin.The exercises are straightforward yet informative, and the examples of Roman literature are well chosen. Even in chapter one you are translating Cicero and learning about Roman culture.Do a chapter every few days, and before you know it you'll be able to read Latin. If you already know some Latin, this is a great refresher course."
5,best latin book,I purchased this for my son who is taking his first year of latin so that he would have a copy from home. i took latin for 4 years many years ago. i think this is either the book we used or it is very similar. i would highly recommend it.
5,Great summary of the elements of Latin,"I may have forgotten the Latin I first learned if it had not been for this excellent elementary book by Wheelock. It gives the most important grammar with a rich selection of enjoyable examples, excerpted from Latin authors. Together with his Reader, one has all one needs to plunge into books in Latin not written for learners."
1,Buy something else!,"I bought Wheelock's Latin 6th edition and notedthere was no correlation between the exercises and theprinted answer keyS in my book. Getting the correct answer keys from the publisher is like having your teeth pulled.Numerous emails and phone calls resulted in this sorry conclusion: the correct anwer keys are availablebut only on line if you have a computer. I don'thave a computer at the moment. An attempted downloadof the answer keys at the library proved futile.I have spent more time trying to resolve this problemthan it has been worth. Personally, I cannot recommendthis book especially if you are like me and don't have a computer. There doesn't seem to be any provision to getthe keys if you don't."
3,hunter cartridge belt,this belt is nice quality and matches the judge holster perfectly. the only problem i had is that the loops were a little hard getting the ammo in.
4,Good for Home Shop,I have been using this planer while building a wooden boat. It is doing a nice job for me and for the price it is just what I needed. The chip bag mount broke on its 2nd use and the bag will not fit in the case without taking it apart. A tie wrap allows me to use the broken chip bag. This is almost a 5 star tool except for the one problem.
3,Planer,did ok for what i needed it for. would have been nice to know more about what was included with the set. ended up buying extra blades that i did not need (extra blades included with the set). Also did not get info on the max depth that it could perform. All said...still a good tool.
2,Fried way too soon,"I have owned this planer for a couple years, but only use it occasionally. Recently I was using it on a door finishing project, heard a clunk, and after that the motor started to bog down. I took it back in to the workshop to check the problem out, only to see chunks of the motor brush contact pads drop out of the venting. I didn't have another and needed it to at least finish the job before it died, but when I fired it back up the RPMs were way down..then give off that familiar smell...then it began to smoke a bit, then it quit all together. I had to run to the hardware store to buy another just to finish the job.In my opinion a product like this isn't supposed to be like the tools that grandpa used and have a predictably short life. In this case, this tool didn't have enough hours on it to constitute tool puberty. It's not like I'm surprised, just disappointed."
3,Promoting a common misconception,"I just purchased this book and thought highly of it until I reached the part that described caseworkers as ""social workers"". As a Licensed Clinical social worker, it very frustrating when one identifies oneself as a social worker (as a licensed professional, I want to promote my profession) and people get confused with caseworkers who, they believe, ""take children away"" and think their parenting skills are being downgraded, rather than understanding they are being referred for therapy. It upsets me that this book, written by professionals, is helping to promote this common misconception. I would hope that they change future editions."
3,Good book for foster kids and foster parents,"Too often children in foster care have no idea why they have been removed from their parents. The system is confusing enough for adults, but children can feel lost, confused, uncertain. This book should be given to every foster parent with children under 10 (maybe even 12). We need something similar for older kids."
3,A Breath Of Fresh Air,"Finally a book that doesn't succumb to the current mental construct that Israel Can Do No Wrong. Reading about the other side of the story, and with such informed writing, is refreshing. Whether you're zionist or not, it's helpful to have some idea of the thought process of the other side.In response to a previous reviewer's claim that this book presented nothing more than criticism of Israel's defending itself - EXACTLY. and the proper response to an opinion differing from yours is not blatant discrediting - rather it would be a thoughtful and logical explanation of why exactly it is wrong to criticize Israel.Back yourself up. It's a good read, and it didn't sway me one way or another. I do, however, feel more informed on the whole issue. Isn't that what a book's supposed to do?"
2,Hezbollah The Lebanese Goodwill organization,"This bookd paints hezbollah in a very benign manner. The author goes to great detail to explain how hezbollah helps the lebanese people. I did not know much about hezbollah before i read this book. I was interested in learning why they were among the world's most feared terrorist groups. This book did not do that for me. From the little I do know about this book it turns the tiger into a mouse. If you're interested in reading about how hezbollah really isnt that bad and Israel is the devil, Buy this book. If you're not keep searching for a good book on hezbollah, I've yet to find one."
1,Hezbollah-Martyers or terrorists,"This book is garbage. It does nothing but bash Israel for defending itself aganist a Fundamentalist band of murderers. Hezbollah is not fighting some oppresve regime but are simply terrorists who are looking to spread the word of Khomeini. Hezzbollah is willing to spread his techings through any means,even if that means sucide bombings. She sheds no light into the groups inner workings and very little into the groups history. The book is simply a mass of anti israel rehtoric."
3,A different perspective...,"I certainly agree with the others who have written reviews for this book in that it is very pro-Hezbollah / sympathetic to Hezbollah. The underlying theme of this book seems to be that Israel brought this upon themselves. Even though the book may be skewed toward the Hezbollah perspective, I still think it is an important book to read for anyone who is trying to learn more about the Middle East and the Arab-Israeli conflict in order to be familiar with the different perspectives of the conflict. One quick comment on the writing style: I thought the book was well written and easy to read. It flowed pretty smoothly and I found it to be a page-turner (which is a pleasant surprise in comparison to some of the other books I have been assigned to read for class)."
1,worst book i ever tried to read,"I just couldn't finish this book. It was way to biased. I even felt that the author was glorifying suicide bombers. This author was obviously sympathetic to hezbollah. The work reminded me of other works i read that were distributed by authoritarian regimes to instill government mandated values. On the plus side, you can read this book if you want to know how a terrorist perceives his duties and justifies his actions. The distortion of reality is vividly portrayed to a disturbing level in the first chapter."
5,Informative account of North American Quail,"This book covers the entire gamet of quail hunting. Inclusive are species biological and ecological requirements, photographs and generalized locality maps. A must for the serious grand slam quail hunter."
4,Enjoyable and Catchy,"Definitely not the greatest album of all time, but quite enjoyable. The English songs are catchy though the lyrics are repetitive and simple. The music is innovative. This is a nice add for a collection but not a major breakthrough in musical arts."
2,Not good enough,"I was eager to listen to this album,after reading reviews which compared Keren-Ann to Julie Cruise, and who says Juile Cruise says Twin Peaks, which is a great piece of cinematic and musical entity (David lynch as director and his composer of choice in almost every project - Angelo Badalamenti). However, after a couple of songs I got the impression that Keren Ann tries to be all cute about her melancholy and how soft her voice is, and how she throws a sitar here and some other stuff there, but I didn't get a glimpse of truly good music. It's like she tries to sell herself or something, but it is not there. So, no mystery, no deep feelings, just another artsy-high maintenace singer chick that cannot give me what I want, and what I want is somethign exciting....peace Keren-Ann, see ya! try to watch some David Lynch movies to live up to your pose."
1,Not worth your time and money,"First of all I don't understand about what frenchness everybody is talking about? Keren Ann was born in Israel, grew up in Holland, and lived in France for a relatively short time. Her French and her English are on par i.e. both are weak. Her voice and singing abilities are however even worse. She tries to sound like Jane Birkin, and sounds like a parody on Paradis. An amateur CD of an amateur singer, which should have never made it to the recording studio."
5,THIS IS AN AMAZING BOOK,"This book proves that pleasure is not just a self-indulgent pursuit of shallow people but a very positive and profound way to approach life. Dr. Resnick gives good information substantiated by research that the better you feel the more energy you have and the better you treat others. Her writing style is clear, personal, and reads easily. Most important, I could really relate to her examples and I used her exercises at the end of the chapters to experiment with some of her suggestions. It has made a real difference in my life and all the people I have recommended the book to have also gotten a lot out of it. I can honestly say that reading The Pleasure Zone has been a powerful experience and I'm happy to pass on the good news."
1,The Pleasure Zone,I think Stella's got too much time on her hands-and wants a lot of money anyway she can get it. Tell me-Did she get her groove back or not?
5,The first PERFECT mouthpiece,I love this thing! its very easy to play high notes with it and it has a very comfortable shape. I highly recommend this mouthpiece.
1,I AGREE WITH THE PERSON BELOW,"This collection is a travesty indeed. Great poems no doubt, but abysmally read. Furthermore they should have put all the introductions together separate and apart from the poems. It's nice to hear intros the first time around. But who wants to hear the intros everytime you listen to the poems? Sometimes I want to hear just a stream of poetry without any interuptions and this format makes that impossible. It's incredible that such a great concept could be so terribly executed."
2,"good poetry, very poor readers","The idea of this collection is fine, but a disastrous decision was made to have the poetry read by American poets. One of the readers, Anthony Hecht, does a good job, but most read no better than your next door neighbor, and some are dreadful, as for example, Jorie Graham. My advice is : save your money for audio poetry read by actors -- there are wonderful collections read by Richard Burton, Christopher Plummer, Alexander Scourby, et al. The Penguin English Poetry collection is also well read. Another problem with this collection is that there is more introductory material read on the tape than actual poetry. This material may be helpful the first time you listen, but will become increasingly annoying as you re-listen."
1,One Hundred Poems Murdered,"What could be an acceptable reading of standards is degraded by sophomoric introductions.Don't buy this, unless for skeet shooting."
3,Not sure how I feel,"This book isn't as neat as I anticipated...it is aimed more at the 10-12 year old that is into that kind of thing...I bought it for my 4 and 8 year old, and I think that they might not enjoy it unfortunately."
5,Loved by toddler,"My nearly 2 year old son loved this toy immediately. It took about 5 minutes of play for him to figure out that building too far in one direction made it all fall down. We played it as a simple game after half an hour of solo play with much experimentation including a crazy tall tower, a verstion that looked like the product photo, and one that looked like a pair of pigtails. It was great at encouraging turn taking. We spent more than hour playing with this toy tonight alone which is amazing for any toy given a toddler's attention span. I have no doubt this will be a long lived toy in our house."
4,Preschool teachers will love this book of activities.,"This book lives up to its name, and also includes reproducibles, letters to parents, and idea-generating children's book suggestions. Each of the ten units are broken up into eight celebratory days' worth of activities."
5,preschool plans,just what I was looking for perfect! I used this book several years ago but it was lost. So happy to find another copy. So many fun things to do!
3,China Bayles continues to find trouble.,"And she continues to solve mysteries -- but not by herself. This series, one of my favorites, seems unfortunately to be losing a little of its identity. As the character loses her independence, she's surrendering some of the feistiness that made the series what it is. In this entry, she starts taking direction from her future husband and, as she does so, she's losing me as a devoted fan. The book is also about 50 pages too long; during the long middle section, I kept finding myself setting it down and doing other things, restless for the book to get on with it. I wouldn't say I was really disappointed, because she's a great mystery writer. Rather, the book isn't faithful to what the series started out to be. I can't fault the author for wanting to take the character in a new direction -- it's up to us whether to follow or not. But, darn it, I really enjoyed the first books in the series. I hope the fun comes back in future books in the series."
3,Love China Bayles,I was expecting CD's for some reason but will still be able to use this in my car for travel. I love all of the China Bayles mysteries.
3,The series is improving,"I bought the whole series through this book (and the next) and this is the best of the lot. The author has a good shtick, centering her books around herbs, but it took her a few books to really get going; and this one ""cooks"" -- literally! The writing is okay for a murder-mystery series, and the plotting is pretty tight -- the continuing characters keep moving forward, and the ""just for this book"" characters are interesting, too."
2,Disapointing,"I have read this book and found some of the information helpful. Unfortunately, the book itself and most of the content is not well put together and in sections very unprofessionally organized. For instance, an entire page is missing in one chapter. There are a number of inaccuracies and the originality of the content is questionable.In short, a very disapointing book."
2,From a VCP who knows - Two Thumbs Down!,"Wow! This book is sad and is probably the worst self-published computer book I've purchased in years.I've been using VMware for 3 years and the content is really no different than what you will find on VMware's website, the VMTN community discussion forums, or in ESX Server documentation.Save your money and use the free resources. As a VCP myself, I am insulted at the recommendations other VCPs have made."
2,Obsolete,"The book is a very good resource for obsolete versions of ESX Server. VMware made substantial changes in their 3.0 release of ESX Server, which is not covered in this book. I suggest waiting for an updated edition."
5,Good book,"I am halfway through the book and really like it. The technology is exciting and the book is very good at walking you through the considerations and instructions related to building a VMware ESX Server without using ""Microsoft Speak"". Cannot go wrong buying this book."
4,Great Explanations,"This provides a very good explanation of the features of ESX 2.5.In addition, it does not skimp recommendations for deploying esx.However, the explanations could go a little bit deeper, and occassionaly the authors refer to VMware documentation instead of explanining it themselves.The index is also VERY light.Otherwise, it gave me a much better understanding of the product and went into much greater depth than the class. I would recommend this for newbies like myself."
3,"Good, But Out of Date","I bought the book trying to learn VMware for the first time. Most of what it refers to is version 3.01 and mentions that iSCSI is not supported. Um, it is now.So it gave me a great basic understanding. But many features now included in 3.0.2 are not included.Good book and he makes some examples quite easy to understand, but the technology has passed it by.I will buy the next version if it is discussing version 3.5 and all the other flavors VMWare has forked it in to now."
2,VMWARE ESX server: advanced technical design Guide,It did not meet my needs - only covering ESX 2.5 - in my view content is out dated. I was looking for VI 3 and ESX 3.5 material.
1,A Great Book with Some Bad Content!,An otherwise good book was ruined by the inclusion of 4 1/2 pages of so-called adult services. It's unfortunate that Harper Collins Publishing would allow such content to be featured in a book I otherwise had high marks for. It wouldn't have hurt sales the least bit to have left the stuff out. I could not and would not recommend this book to others!
1,"Should be Called ""HotGuide to Online Porn!""","BotGuide - The Internet's Hottest Tools that Work the Web For You, written by Michael Wolff and Peter Rutten, with Ben Greenman, lists hundreds of research and automated tools that can perform a variety of very helpful tasks. However, pages 231 through 235 offers readers...some descriptions and links to online porn sites..."
4,Beware the Old One!,"Strange Eons is a trio of tales that chart the awakening of Cthulthu, the slumbering, dreaming Elder God of H.P. Lovecraft's mythos. Fans of the C.M. will want to snag this and gobble it up. Recommended."
3,Beatles with a bit of soul,"This is a nice enough compilation. 16 tracks of soul and funk covers of classic Beatles songs (and one solo McCartney). Nothing particularly rare (the Earth, Wind & Fire track, for instance, is readily available at any thrift store on the Sgt. Pepper's movie soundtrack), but it's nice to have all the songs together. A major detractor is the redundant ""mix"" second cd. The tracks aren't really remixed, just re-shuffled."
5,5 Stars from someone who's been there!,"I purchased this book for my father who visits Scotland to golf each year. He LOVED the book. He said, ""it really captures the feel of walking the courses"". He is excited to go back this Spring and look at them in a new light since noticing things in the book. A great gift for the golfer in your life!"
5,Facing a fear,"If you enjoy realistic fiction children's book's, you will love this one. Sarah and her mother are hiking to the top of Baldhead to pick up a surprise for father's birthday. Sarah is very nervous about the climb, and she fears falling or slipping on the rocks. However, when mom gets hurt, Sarah needs to face her fear or rock climbing. Will she be able to successfully help her mother without putting herself in danger? This story will not only take you on an adventure, but it is filled with bits of humor that the whole family will love."
2,Soap Opera Delux,"Frothy and as unsatisfying as cotton candy - ok I suppose if you are REALLY bored. 3 women crazy about one man, one senator, one lecher and one boy, panting after these women - and no-one gets who they want in the end. A rainy day read if you have nothing else to read. I only finished it to see who gets who in the end... It's not a BAD book, but I found the writing a bit stilted and boring to read. For instance, by far not in the same league as writer Margaret Atwood, whose writing is a delight to read. THe storyline was ok and the characters not bad. But it is not a book I would recommend or read again."
5,Great letterbox print!!!!,2 trashig kung fu flixs on 1 DVD to the first Time in a beatieful letterbox Format (2:35).The Traile are in Fullscreen. I love this nonstop Punching Flixs.Good DVD!!!!
5,You will want to pass this one around...,"Buy several copies, because you will want to pass this real life story around. The essence of the story will stay with those who read it because it probes our natural behaviors and invites us to consider other possibilities. Readers who are familiar with systems thinking will appreciate the realistic application of ideas in the workplace. Those who have not been introduced to systems thinking will benefit from this very practical exploration of some of the discipline's most important concepts."
3,Lots of pictures!,"A great big book with lots of pictures and history of theBulgari jewelry house. I found it interesting, and worthlooking at if you have an specific interest in jewelry.Probably most worth buying if you are a jewelry collectoror historian."
5,This is a First Rate Book,"By far the best book on the art and science of jewelry design and marketing I have ever read. The photographs are beautifully presented, and the text is excellent. Produced with cooperation of the Bulgari family, it tells the tale how two Greek brothers founded one of the great jewelry houses of the world, and how their children and grandchildren continue the development of the creative and financial side of the business. A fascinating inside look at the the Bulgari family and their achievements in the world of jewelry design."
2,feedback,"The stand that holds the papertowel is unsteady and the holes drilled for the topper were uneven so it is very difficult to change the paper towel roll. The product was adorable as advertised, but upon receipt, I was disappointed in how unstable the product is."
2,Why?,"I remember being disappointed when I bought this. I had even pre-ordered it and kept watching the release date. After the great Budokan and Score DVDs, this is truly embarrassing.I tried watching it again today, but it's really painful. Even though you get lots of songs and original jams, most of the video footage looks atrocious, both quality-wise and the handling of the camera. The sound is not great either and Labrie sings very poorly, but at least you do hear Myung on this one. The presentation, menus and extras are all very nice, but the main feature keeps this package down. I really don't see the point of releasing such a DVD.Also, I thought that the old idea of putting little pointless interviews between songs was over. It's truly annoying when you're trying to get into the music."
3,dream on,"A die hard fan would love this video. I have always enjoyed their work and listen to their work often. I was, a little disappointed in the quality of some of the footage.James Labrae's vocals seemed strained. I almost felt sorry for him. I think he is an amazing artisit, I wish they would have picked more flattering songs from the begining of the journey around the world. They all look worn out and in need of a vacation.I personally love their new albulm THAT IS WORTH EVERY CENT! CHAOS IN MOTION THE ALBULM IS YOUR BETTER INVESTMENT by a lONG SHOT!"
3,"Music Great, Vocals Not so Great","I have to agree with most of the previous reviews. I was (for the most part) disappointed with this DVD. I don't really mind the video quality of this disc, (It certainly doesn't rival ""Score or Budokan""), but It resembled a more natural filming style. I really enjoy the musical (jamming) sessions, but I felt that the vocals were forced and off key way too often. Not what I expected from one of the best vocalists in the business."
2,Huge Disappointment,I will make this review short and sweet. I am a huge Dream Theater fan and I purchase everything that they do. Dream Theater moved into my number two ranking of all time favorite bands behind only Camel. But with the release of Systematic Chaos and Black Clouds and Silver Linings and Chaos in Motion I must say that Dream Theater is no longer my #2 band. I have only watched this DVD one time. The second time I tried to watch it I could not watch more than 10 minutes. Dream Theater must become more creative or they are going to lose alot of their fan base. And oh yes Mike Portnoy I love you man but whats up with all the swearing on this video?!!! Clean up your act Mike!
3,mmm i'm not sure...,"hello there DT fans! the title of my review is ""i'm not sure"" so let me explain. i read on wikipedia that this 2-dvd set is a concert and some extra footage of DT's last tour so i think it'll be awesome, but my doubt comes here: have you guys checked the collectors edition? It contains the regular 2-dvd set plus 3 discs but those discs are the audio version of the concert's DVD. well, the deluxe collector's edition costs almost 15 bugs more (perhaps $5 each CD). still having in mind that it's a DELUXE COLLECTOR'S edition and hopefully the package will be awesome, I DON'T KNOW IF BUYING THE DELUXE EDTION WORTHS IT. i've already pre-oredered it but i still have time till september 30th to change my mind. PLEASE HELP ME!!!"
3,It Is What It Is !,"I almost think that Portnoy wanted it this way, Because if you watch Score that is one of the best DVDs/Cds i have ever heard. Some people think i am nuts, but that DVD/CD is great. Chaos In Motion - Well They obviously couldn't record wih HD Camers , because of the expense and as far as the songs & performances - I think they are average at best Except Surrounded which i think is outstanding work especially Petrucci, and i think he shines on this DVD/CD..........But like i said it is average at Best. I was looking so forward to this and now that i have seen & listened to it ..mmmmmmmmmmmmmmm Not so Good!"
2,Video Quality is Horrible,"The live portion looks as if someone shot this with a camcorder from 1985. Compared to the Score and Budokan DVD's this is a bootleg. I have the Dark Side of the Moon and and Live in Bucharest bootleg DVD's and the video quality is similar. The audio on the DVD is good, which is why I can't understand why the video quality is so bad.Buy this for the bonus stuff (videos of the singles off of Systematic Chaos) and the behind the scenes documentary. Not for the live section."
3,More of the same (good with bad),"To the point, like has already been said, I had no idea this would be a raw footage DVD, which will require some adjusting to, especially since Budokan and Score spoiled me so thoroughly.Also, James Labrie's singing was just...off! I totally loved Blind Faith (Six Degrees was my first DT album), but I found myself wincing every time he hit the high note in the hook. That's my main complaint really, he's great so long as he stays in the mid to low range. I'm really sorry about his throat injury from years past, but it seems like it's still plagues him. I sincerely hope he overcomes this.Now for the good stuff: The muscianship! These guys are incredible! Right now I've just finished listening to Surrounded and the ad libs and embellishments are brilliant. They have set the bar pretty high and they continue to live up to it. I can't wait to hear the rest."
3,"Good, could be better","OK, as a Dream Theater fan, musicianship on this DVD is fantastic. But we all know that. I really don't have a problem with the format per se, just the execution of it and the cost of the DVD. Video quality is, at best, a very good SD videocam. But with consumer HD videocams at under $600, couldn't we use those? Heck, even the interviews video quality is sub par. And the 5.1 sound is not the best, sometimes has weird sounds coming from the rear speakers and has little or no subwoofer action going. Could be better. If the price were say $10 less I would give it four stars because of the value, but at $24...... And before I get slammed like anyone here who dares to say something bad, 3 stars is still ""good"" and I'm still enjoying the DVD. Just wishing for better."
2,disappointing,"I bought this book after reading ""Patty Jane's House of Curl"" and it just did not work for me. There is not a truly likable character in this book. Everyone is screwing around with people for no good reason I can see or else is completely self-centered. I had a hard time believing that the one affair could ever happen, I mean after all, if you're going to screw up a long term, happy marriage shouldn't you at least be ATTRACTED to the person you have the affair with? also I did not care for the variety of narrators. This book in no way is on a par with ""house of curl"". While it is written well, The story never seems to tie together. 264 pages into the book and I'm still wondering ""what is this book about?"""
4,"Witty, humerous and serious","Lorna Landvik has created a wonderful novel full of incredible characters, each unique and touching in their own way. From the tomboy to the anorexic, from the pudgy housewife to the car salesman, Landvik does an excellent job of slipping many small pieces of society into her work, each with its own cliches.I thought her technique in allowning nearly all the characters to narrate was a wonderful idea, and really allowed the reader to get into the book, the minds of the characters and the author.If you love a book that'll make you laugh and cry, than Your Oasis is on Flame Lake."
3,"Enjoyable Fluff, but not a Page Turner","Like her book Angry Housewives Eating Bon Bons this book jumps from character to character, but it's so much more annoying in this book. Again there are children who are unbelievably wise and good for their ages. What female teenager could find happiness with false teeth? I guess at the time this book takes place implants weren't an option.Still, you can't help but have some interest in the characters even though they seem more like caricatures than real people. I loved the setting--a residential neighborhood set in Minnesota on a lake that doesn't allow motorboats. I haven't read Patty Jane's House of Curl yet, but am looking forward to it because it's supposed to be so much better."
3,"OK, not great","This book is a good read, although to me it was a little disappointing. After reading ""Patty Jane's House of Curl,"" I expected a quirkier book, but built on the same bedrock of real life experiences and emotions as ""Patty Jane."" Don't get me wrong--""Your Oasis on Flame Lake"" is not a bad book. It's well written and moving in spots. The characters have the ring of truth to them. Unlike a number of other reviewers, I didn't find the alternating narrative perspectives confusing. But ""Your Oasis"" lacks the occasional outlandishness that made Landvik's first work so enjoyable. Where ""Patty Jane's"" sparkles, this book merely glimmers."
5,"An interesting, and realistic view of life in a small town","Ms.Landvik confused the heck out of me at first, as I'd don't remember reading a novel, where the story is narrated by so many characters. However, once I got into the story, I was looking forward, eagerly, to see how Sergio felt, or Franny was coping as the story progresses. My favorite character is Franny, who does not do any of the narrating! This story may not have a ""fairy-tale-ending"" for everyone, but what is does have is a typical, brilliantly written, slice of Americana going into the new year 2000. I found this book hard to put down. It's full of sadness, laughter, and life in general."
3,CHARMING BUT HARD TO FOLLOW,I tried to get into the lives of these people but found the book rather choppy and hard to follow .I liked Patty Janes house of curl much better
2,"""Your Oasis On Flame Lake"" wasn't an oasis!","I had to read this book as an assignment for a class. I picked this book because I thought it would be interesting and I liked the reviews it got. Unfortunately, I was wrong. Overall, I thought the book was boring and lacked reader involvement. I couldn't get very interested in the book mainly because four of the main characters are in their 40's. I really don't have much in common with them. I also sometimes got confused with all the characters. With five people telling the story it got a little confusing. By the time it got the climax I was disinterested already and the climax didn't do anything for me. I really didn't like the fact that two of the main characters cheated on their spouse. Also, the ending bothered me. One kid died, another might be paralyzed, but everything is all good with the main characters so it seems like everything in the world is okay."
4,Good Plant Stand,"Overall pleased with product, but I didn't realize assembly was required. However, it only took about 5-10 minutes to put together."
4,Great!,They are beautiful but not easy to put together. They lack the ability to be able to put a glass top on each shelf. I am using them as nightstands.
3,"Good product, I feel price is little bit high end","Good product, quality also very good. Only I am giving 3 because I felt price is little bit high-end. I bough it for a corner plant stand. Its holding the pot and plant very nicely. It has enough room to stuff in the down racks. Over all its a good product apart from the price"
4,Nice stand,"The stand is nice and easy to put together. However, it is smaller than I anticipated. I should have looked at the dimensions more carefully. But I kept it and overall it works good for holding plants."
1,doesn't cover outside screen!,"TERRIBLE! Do not believe the picture that shows the outside screen encased in plastic, there is a HUGE HOLE AROUND THE SCREEN! Naturally, the only reason you would need a case at all for an aluminum phone is to protect the screen, and it doesn't even do that! so what is the point!?? Duh, aluminum is stronger than plastic so why are all these crazy people buying these and giving them great reviews just because it protects the aluminum part?? These cases don't protect the screen or camera lens whatsoever, which are the only friggin things that needs protecting!? bah I hate people. Hopefully this review will keep others from making the same mistake I did, not to mention that the shipping charge is more than 10 times what the case even costs."
4,"Not bad, but not the best.","This had some really tasty recipes that my boyfriend did enjoy. However, the way I see it, men love food no matter what it is and they'll eat almost anything. Some of these recipes were perhaps a little too ""gourmet"" for my meat and potatoes man. Not a waste of money, but you shouldn't expect a marriage proposal by making him the lamb chops, but he might help you with the dishes!"
3,A Classic,"This book has 7 chapters, and is an update of the 1955 edition. It is a comprehensive overview of inorganic silica chemistry up until 1979 and is full of information; each chapter has 200 to 400 references (5*). However, I have always been mystified by the organization of the material within the chapters, and have never found this to be an easy book to use to find information quickly (1*). However, because of its comprehensiveness, it is a necessary book for anyone who practices inorganic silica chemistry. (It's the ONLY book of its type! 20 years, and no competition! Another update is sorely needed) A complementary, more modern book on silica chemistry is the ""Better Ceramics through Chemistry - Sol-Gel Silica"" compilation by Brinker and Scherer. Both of these books are geared towards researchers, rather than use as texts."
5,my favorite book,I love this version which is easy to understand and the photos are gorgeous. I try to look at it several times a week and contemplate the simple but deep teachings of the Buddah.
4,Sounds of Wellness,"Oliveros et al. conceived a way to perform natural drone music, thus imaginatively naturalizing (i.e. making acoustic) ambient music. This music, serene, whale-song-like yet searching, is the emboodiment of a desire to interweave attenuated pitches into a meditative whole. Dempster's trombone, as odd as it might seem at first, makes an outstanding contribution to the agenda. This is music at the service of contemplation."
4,"excellent readability, easy to set-up and operate.","Panasonic brands have been one of my all time favorites and this fax machine just reinforces my belief in the product line. It is easy to set up and operate. The drop in cartridge is wonderful. The only drawback I see is there is no exiting paper catch/tray. I would have rated it five stars had there been one, even if I had to purchase separately."
4,"Easy to use, cost effective","Just recieved this unit. Was able to use it out of the box, without looking at the instructions. I did have to clean the rollers and reading area to get it to print without lines or blank spots...looks fine now. Also, the paper tray that others had to purchase is now included as a ""promotional item""...guess they caught some grief over that. I think it does all I would expect it to at this price; send and recieve faxes and make an occasional copy. Overall, a decent little unit."
3,It serves the main purpose.,"The best value for personal use and/or small home-based office.Other than an awkward provided tray, I manage at least to provide a box underneath it so that the incoming faxes don't just fly away and get lost under the table!"
2,Picture Quality is below avg,"I really wanted a pair of these type glasses to watch movies on my video ipod. I figured this would be great for airplanes and long cardio workouts. So I went into Sharper Image and tried them out with my girlfriend. We were both shocked at how lousy the picture quality is. I would have been happy had the glasses produced a larger type image then just watching the ipod alone, but thats not the case. The picture was grainy and small. The earbuds that it comes with are really cheap. I will confess that maybe thats because I own Shure e4c's which are incredible though high priced. After my trial run in the store, I would tell anyone considering buying one to go to a sharper image and test this product first. I know they make a more expensive higher resolution model but thats 799."
5,A night to remember,"I cannot think of an album which makes me wish more fervently that I was present at the concert where these tracks were recorded than this one. In the audience on a ""Black & White Night"" was surely the place to be.The excitement generated by this old legend and perhaps a few younger legends-to-be was palpable. Roy sounded as good on most of these songs as he did recording them originally some thirty years ago. ""Running Scared"", ""Only the Lonely"", ""Crying"", ""Its Over"" and the rest are classics in anyone's book.When they all get together to close the show with ""Pretty Woman"", it is a great moment. Worth every penny, whether you have the originals or not.."
4,Public television fund raiser,Our local (WVIZ) public TV Cleveland station has broadcast the video of this concert as a fund raising attraction on several occasions. I pay for my TV through the cable company could not justify a $90 donation for this CD. I am delighted to find it at Amazon for a fraction of the price.
5,9 month old loves these animals!,My 9 month old son adores these wooden critters! I always supervise him when he has them Bc they are for older children. He digs through his toy basket to find the alligator.
5,"A teacher's book, by a teacher of teachers","A teacher's book, by a teacher of teachers, this book helps the driver to develop the most powerful modification to the car possible....the brain of the driver. This book is not just about the car, track and driver, but how to think and analyze all of them for whatever track you are on, car you are driving or conditions you confront. All of which will contribute to making you safer as well as faster on the track. The lessons are clear, some obvious and some quite subtle and far from obvious.....until you ""get it"". These elements are not typically addressed as well, if at all, in other books directed to performance driving, yet they are undeniably critical to going fast. It is a great little ""refresher"" to leaf through the evening before a track event, before you close your eyes and visualize driving the circuit in your head for a few laps prior to bed time."
4,A great primer on racing.,"This book is an excellent introduction to what race car drivers do, why they do it, and how they do it. Before I read this book, all I knew about car racing was ""race cars go around a track real fast"". Now I know about the apex, under/oversteer, scrubbing off speed, trail braking, and finding the line. There's also penty of info on suspension tuning if I ever feel like spending the bucks to have it done.I am so happy I read this book prior to my first autocross event in my 911. I able to take the concepts explained in the book and immediately apply them to the course I was racing. And I beat my big-mouth buddy by 1/10th of a second. Sweeeeeeeeeet."
5,"If you think you've read it all, BUY THIS BOOK!!","This book is wonderful, I have just about all the driving books available today and was unsure about buying this one... I am very happy that I did, it was and is very worth the money.Bentley, who does still race, is easy to read and talks in terms of real world driving, on the street. Yes, he covers a lot about on the race track and the finer points, but her relates that to the street and the ""practice"" of feeling the car and understanding what is happening at all times in order to become a better driver... and it actually works, I have started to become more aware of the fine movements of weight distribution in my commute to work!If you think you have too many books on driving, splurge a little and buy this one, I think you'll be happy you did!"
5,Concise and helpful read,"I bought this book along with Going Faster, and have definitely gravitated toward this book. It's not quite as elementary and wordy. It's organized around propositional statements - ""Speed Secrets"" - which are supported with theory and example. Great read"
2,Nothing useful here,"This book is a collection of essays written by university folks who've implemented portals. They tend to be repetitive and have little to say that's really useful. Unless you are the very beginning of the process - evaluating whether to do a portal, or if you still need to evangelize the idea of one - this book is a waste of time. If you're looking for tactical approaches or anything related to actual implementation strategies, you won't find it here."
1,The worst fitness book in the history of the world . . . .,"I have an extensive collection of fitnesss and weight training books and this is by far the worst I have ever read, purchased, seen, etc. By far.It is poorly written, poorly structured, confusing, etc. It has VERY technical exercises (1 arm get up using a barbell, 1 arm snatch, etc.) with almost no instructon on how to perform them.Perhaps the routines themselves are good, but the book is so poorly organized that is is difficult to even see how the routines are structured.This offers absolutely nothing of value. A terrible, terrible, purchase."
3,Capacious but noisy,"I chose this fanny/belt pack to replace a leather one from Wilson's, the zippers of which broke in just 18 months from the strain of what I stuffed that pack with. Time will tell if this pack suffers from the same problem.So far, the capacity is what I need, and the extra cell phone pocket is just dandy. I like that the nylon doesn't scuff the way the leather on my former pack did.But this thing is noisy. The heavy-duty zipper pull tabs clank with every stride. The manufacturer should have spend a few cents more per item and had rubber pull tabs put in. Also, the waist adjustment band has no neat way to terminate the free end. I ended up putting a rubber band on the inner strap, sort of like a belt loop for the outer strap.I'll come back in 18 months and update my rating for the product's longevity and value."
2,Sucks.,"I bought this to have a convenient place to keep documents while flying. Money, passports, etc... I haven't owned this for a day, and the zipper doesn't work properly; have to pull it back and forth several times and by luck of the draw it may open. The stitching is coming undone already. The front pouch won't hold a cell phone, it's too small. Right now I need this to be functional and I wish I had spent a little more to get one that does the job that it's supposed to... I'd strongly consider doing the same if you're in the market for one of these. I gave it 2 stars because if everything worked as intended, it would be a good pack. ""...If..... """
4,GEOCACHING 2 SOME,So far so good. Holds everything we need for geocaching. Small pouch is not big enough for Iphone but holds my GPS very well. All around good buy.
4,Sturdy and strong,I use this daily and it is sturdy and strong. I wish the phone pocket held my iPhone but it is too small. I have to put it in a zippered pocket.
1,Looks Cheap,...and is. Inferior nylon. Bright chrome zippers. Would never have bought it if the picture represented what it really looks like. To those hoping that fanny packs make a come back--this is definitely a set back. And to all those shopping around: spend your money on a quality product. I wish I had.
2,Useful,"Everything about this fanny pack is useful... except that it doesn't work with my new wardrobe. I was really hoping it would immediately have me looking more like a ""dad."" I had everything else that I needed: white New Balance tennis shoes, jeans that are a bit too short, and a t-shirt tucked into said jeans. But I'm afraid the fanny pack said a little too much ""world traveler"" and less ""hopeless dad."" So, I'll continue my search for a fanny with more pockets and cell phone clips!"
1,why won't they talk to me.,So my whole life I have been a big fan of sweat pants tucking my t-shirt into my sweats and wearing sandals with socks. I love to be comfortable but I also love convenience. Unfortunately my sweats are usually lacking in the pocket category so I thought I would jazz up my look a bit with this fine item. I noticed that during family outings my wife and children wouldn't walk very close to me and my teenage daughter started taking the bus instead of letting drive her. And people I don't even know tend to snicker as i walk by. I don't know if it is due to the fanny but all I can say is buyers beware this to might happen to you. Plus I think itmight make my butt look big.
2,"OK, NOT GREAT","The Fanny Pack was Ok, nothing to Cheer about. One of the Zippers Broke the Same night i wore it. I would not order again if i had to. I really need to send back bacuse it was not worth my TIme in ordering."
2,fannypack,the velcro didn't stick very good at all and almost lost my phone. One end of the strap by the fannypack itself came unsewed. I contacted the company and they will send a replacement. The fannypack is a real nice one otherwise. I purchased it through Amazon.
5,Nice Roomy Fanny Pack.,"I own a dog walking buisness and I use my fanny pack daily, it has lots of zippers and very sturdy. hold all my keys, phone, knife, ect. Love it comfortable to wear.Most of all GREAT PRICE."
5,Great for xbox.,The cable works great for playing system link with my xbox 360's. Would highly recommend to anyone looking for a crossover cable that works great for a low price.
5,Lutyens bench,"Very pretty,easy to assemble. I bought two of them they look great in my flower gardens."
5,Thank you for sharing your experiences.,Our consciousness does not dictate our lives. We choose to expand or remain stagnate. The book was another doorway to accepting my own experiences and the poems resonated truth in my soul.
4,A book well worth reading,"This book stuck out in a row of library books as I walked down the aisle of a local library in 1998. I had been recovering from a severe illness when I found this book and read it. It gave me tremendous hope and it helped me to understand more about Jesus. Jesus is alive as the Messiah, and all the scriptures bear testimony to this fact, but Sparrow's book gives present day evidence, to those who can accept it, that He is alive and loves each person. Sparrow, for his excessive analysis, makes it wonderfully clear that Jesus came to know, love, heal and save both those who saw Him in a vision and all others who seek Him. Read the book and you will understand."
1,errol flynn by nicholson,This is not a book about Flynn - but a sleazy novel using Flynn's name-not for flynn fans
4,Bach: Partitas Nos. 4 & 6,Bach: Partitas Nos. 4 & 6 is a recording being played by Freddy Kempf (piano) on this BIS Records AB recording from 2006. Gould has set the standard for how to play Bach and Kempf whilst being an accomplished piano player in his own right comes nowhere close. That being said this is a pleasant enough recording that I would recommend. The booklet is roughly 20 pages long and contains liner-notes by Jean-Paul Vachon (translated into English by Andrew Barnett). Recommended. 4/5.
3,WWI Movie Classic,would have preferred a listing of the titles. This was a christmas gift but the person already has most of the ones included in this package.
1,Don't listen,"This CD is not for the faint at heart. Apparently, La Koro Sutra is Lou Harrison's finest choral work. If that is the case, I would hate to hear any other. It is very boring and often very meditative. I was severely disappointed with his music.If you are a Harrison fan, the performance on this CD is mediocre."
3,"Good history, poor editing","The author provides an interesting insider's view of von Braun's rocket team. However, the book suffers from poor editing: names of cities in Germany and Belgium are quite simply incorrect. It also seems to me that the measurements of the missiles mentioned in the book cannot possibly be correct; they are given as metric, but are no doubt recalculations of English engineering units. The results are ludicrous. Range of the A4 is given as a convenient conversion of miles; engine diameter is a conversion of 1 foot, etc. If you are interested in a good read you will find lots of hard to find historical anecdotes in this book, but for me the story is spoiled and seriously flawed due to the aforementioned inconsistencies. Unfortunately this is not atypical for these kinds of histories. Some serious editing required!"
4,Good book,"This book gives an accurate account of the Development of one of Germany's secret weapond in the second world war, the V-2 rocket, from the Germans scientist's point of view that developed it. It accurately describes the experiments, the tests and shows what the scientists behind Germany's V-2 rocket program were really like.I recommend this book to all that are intrested in the seeds of space travel or World War Two."
1,The Jewish Book of Why,"I was very disappointed in the book. The book I received was a Miniature Edition, however, no where in the advertisement was this indicated. The book was 2-1/2"" x 3"" and there was very little information in the 175 pages.Had I known the book was so small, I would not have ordered it. This book was misrepresented. I plan to order another regular size printed version from another company."
2,Beware!,"Beware: this is a miniaturized version of the book! When ordering, I didn't notice the matchbox size...The ""real book"", is out of print apparently."
4,Informative,It was incredibly informative and I learned alot. Perhaps my unanswered questions are in the second edition!
3,Better ask your Rabbi,This book has:Good questions... sometimes.unanswered questions... one or two.Repeated questions...many times.Several superstitions...those are forbidden by Jewish law.So if you want to learn about Jewish law you may read this book but if you have doubts ask your Rabbi
1,vj,"The book is a tiny 1 inch book, I was expecting a paperback book. I read this book before and enjoyed it, but this copy is much too small to read. I wouldn't even think Amazon would send a book this size to a customer."
5,Blue Devil is Amazing,"2001 Dodge Ram 1500 with 68,000 miles. I purchased this truck new and on a cross country move towing a trailer it happened at 800 miles later. Over heated and had to get a car hauler to take it the rest of the way. After replacing the thermostat, hoses, flushing out, it still over heated.Found out about Blue Devil head gasket sealant. Yesterday I put it in the truck and ran it for an hour and drove it 10 miles.Today I drove to the other side of Tucson and back, about an hour and was surprised to see it only got between 1/4 & 1/2 on the gauge. It was 107 degrease in stop and go traffic. I am a believer in this product. Would recommend this to anyoneRon"
1,Blue Devil Failure,"I had a Gasket leaking about a pint on a 150 mile trip, followed instructions to a T, next day went out to start vehicle and had a cylinder full of water, which busted one piston and striped the teeth off my starter, very very very disappointed , ruined my engine. I rated this one a minus 10. never again"
1,THIS PRODUCT DOES NOT WORK,I HAD USED THIS PRODUCT TWICE FOR THE SAME CAR & IT STILL DIDNT WORK FOR MY 2002 IMPALA...IT STILL SMOKES FROM THE TAIL PIPE & IT HASN'T WORKED YET...I WANT MY FULL REFUND BACK.
3,OK tool at the right price,"I can't believe the price now ($204.05). I bought this (thru Amazon) in Jun 2005 for $74.99 ($90.92 including shipping and tax). For my price, its an OK deal. It uses 3 lasers, each covering 120 degrees to get the total 360 degree coverage. There is a risk of one or two of the lasers to be mis-aligned; but I found that mine was pretty accurate. The self leveling worked fine. The packaging was also nice with the legs folding up to make a case.I'm glad I got it at the $75 price; but I certainly wouldn't pay the current over $200 asking price. For a little more I think you can get something with more precision."
2,Not so hot,This isn't the best hunting game around. It's a bit boring and predictable. It was a disappointment.
5,Hi Neil Murray!,"This has been one of Whitesnake's weakest albums IMHO, but the remaster has completely changed the sound of this album. The pumping bass of Neil Murray is very evident and gives the songs new life. Nice job EMI!"
3,not very good : (,This is not a very good album at all. It is not true Whitesnake. I bought it mostly for the cover art and becuz I've never seen it before. I didn't know it existed until a month ago. There are much better W.S. albums to listen to than this one. The cover is very sexy. The music is not too good! : (
5,Great for everybody,"When I took history of art at College this was my textbook. I learned more with this book than in five years of history of art at high school.It not only explains art, it also gives a ride through the historical moment that is going on, so it is easier to understand the tendencies and their changes.It is a complete book that uses a not complex language; that is why is GREAT FOR EVERYBODY..."
4,relaxing and super sexy,"this cd was given to me by a friend, i was first hesitant to listen to it, but as soon as i did , instant smiles all the way to the last track. it has alittle drum n bass, a little swing and lots of smooth jazz. i recommend this for an after party, needing to relax cd. Or just laying in bed"
4,Good multifunction fax/copy/answering machine,"This is my first home office fax so I do not have anything to compare against but my initial reaction is as follows:Pros: 1)Sending/Receiving Faxes and Making Copies are simple tasks 2)Retrieving voice messages is a simple task 3)Saves space on the desk 4)Preloaded greetings are clear and present a professional image.Cons: 1)Noisier than I expected 2)Print quality is slightly less than expected 3)Too many functions make it more complex to use...I need the manual(thick) to perform the steps for some functions 4)Adding phone directory entries is awkward 5)The absence of a paper stacker results in paper on the floor; however, it can be ordered separately for approximately $12."
1,This product is very frustrating,"After using two of these Panasonic fax machines, I will not buy another. When it works, it's great, but the paper feeder is very unreliable and then the machine starts beeping even though it has paper. If the machine has any error whatsoever, it will make loud, audible beeps until the machine detects the error resolved, not when you think it's fixed. If you buy this fax, make sure you won't use it much."
5,The best book ever on anxiety,"This is absolutely the best book on anxiety ever written. I recommend it to my clients all the time. Why? It puts anxiety in perspective without demonizing it. Quite the contrary...it clearly explains the entire spectrum from genuinely toxic anxiety to excitement. In addition, it provides an approach for healing and transforming toxic anxiety that really works. Enough said...buy the book."
2,Overpriced,"What you get here is not what you expect. Only 3 songs I knew and I am from the dinosaur age. Only 1 song my grandson knew. The only worthwhile part of this book is the front part with strumming, tuning, stringing, and holding instructions. You can perhaps get that for free from the web."
3,Nice shade.... don't expect it to be functional however....,"Light only shines straight down due to the solid brown shade, so it's not functional for anything practical.The top finale (spelling?) on the lamp is NOT what comes with it; it is just a round ball.Mine also was dented on one side, but I just faced it towards the wall as I didn't want to send it back. It looked great with my decor.Rather pricey for what you're actually getting."
4,Force under pressure,"I have read a lot of books pertaining to police work. This is the first one that I have had the opportunity to read that is written for police officers. This book is geared for a police officer to read. It brings up many insights into officer safety, feelings of guilt and sadness, along with how to deal with them. The only negative thing that I could say about this book would be that it is written almost in a ""school book"" or informative style. I think that the author could have used othre angles to make it a little more interesting."
2,A painful and awkward book,"It is a real grind to read this book. It might be improved in a number of ways.Maybe toss out about half the repetitious material. Be more specific and includemore concrete and analyzed examples. I'm not sure that Blum is clear on who he iswriting this book for and what he is trying to accomplish and communicate - even thoughhe states his purpose (trying to save the lives of cops in life and death encounters).With effort, useful information can be wrestled from the book."
5,Superb,"For those who love crime genre, this is a must read! A book about the life cops written from the heart. The author brings the pages alive, revealing aspects of modern day crime and methods to fight such. An easy to read, funny, shocking, frightening and thrilling book, which lifts the lid on modern police work. Whether a lawyer or a criminal, a cop or an armchair sleuth, this is one for your collection. I could not put it down."
3,USMM will always be the fourth arm of the Goverment,"Great Suff on this DVD for guys like me who really did sail in our United States Merchant Marine. My problem for only 3 stars is that this DVD would not play on my DVD player,only on the computer...whats up with that?"
5,Wonderful authentic classic western movie.,"Hats off to Alan Autry , David Hart and their crew for filming one of the finest westerns that I have seen in a very long time. This movie is very authentic, you get a chance to feel and see how people lived out west in the post Civil War era. The cinematography is excellent, with wonderful lighting. Forgiven was edited fantastic, it flows nicely at a very good pace. Most of the music is original, creative and was recorded very well. The acting is superb, well above average including some of Alan and David's finest acting to date. At a time when Hollywood is producing so many filthy dirty movies, we need more movies like Forgiven. I admired how Autry presents biblical Christian truths without being too preachy. This Southern Baptist minister / reviewer puts his stamp of approval on Forgiven for the entire family, except for perhaps children under six. I am looking forward to seeing more of Autry's productions in the future. Bravo."
1,"dry, slow and boring",I purchased this DVD to have a movie night with some friends. I am so glad I watched the movie before inviting anyone over to see it. I try to find good Christian films with a message. If there was a message in this one I guess I missed it. I was very disappointed in it. This is one of those movies that start out slow and you assume will pick up the pace anytime now- but never does. Even in the fight scenes it was as if the actors were moving in slow motion. I honestly couldn't wait until it was over. I would only have friends over to watch this movie if I were having a slumber party and and it was time for everyone to fall asleep-it definitely would help them do that!!
1,AAGGHH!!!!!,"What a disapointment - I would send this movie back for a refund if I thought I could. I cannot believe this movie ever made it past someone's imagination. I was anticipating a nice clean Christian based movie that had a western flair. Instead we got a'holy' mess. What a waste. Rent this movie before you consider buying. I was so bored I cannot even tell you the story line, we turned the movie off and through the dvd into the trash. The people that made this movie should pay us to watch it. The really sad part of all is yet another Christian based movie - left to look less than 5th rate. Wait until you raise enough money to make a good movie, like Facing the Giants and others that are made under that label."
2,"Searching for the artist wiithin , karlyn Holman",I love the book but why was a used book so costly. I could have bought it new for 24.99 Too bad I found it out after I purchased yours
4,wolly cover looks pretty good,I have not used this dual roller cover for 2 colors yet. In looking at it I would have prefered slighty denser roller cover.....depending on how much you want to appy at one time. The twin tray to use with these roller is the thinnest plastic imaginable.
4,"They really mean ""pocket""","Pros: Full of good info, if you already have some idea. Like the science equivalent of a pocket foreign language dictionary (that is, if you already know the language but just need help with vocabulary). If you never learned this stuff in school, this might not make a lot of sense. Overall, a good reference book.Con: They really meant it when they said ""pocket"". The physical size is great, until you try reading the smaller print. I didn't think my eyes were getting so old..."
1,Price Double Supermarket's,Smuckers Apricot Preserves is a good product. My objection is this vendor's pricing per unit.It is more than double supermarket price per unit of $3.99.
2,Not impressed,"Had this nailer for a year and it worked fine until some plastic parts in the magazine broke. Good for a few projects, but does not hold up under heavy use."
5,Bingo Shutter Cards,"Shutter Bingo Cards are high quality, and quick to use . . . players commented how nice they were."
1,horrible,the fisrt disc is sissy sounding people singing. the only good song is by go betty go. and the other disc is stupid screamo and spazoid stuff. what a waste of money!! :(
2,Careful punks...,"The warped tour used to be mostly punk bands with great music, but this 2 disc garbage has got to stop. This isn't much more than one big screamo fest, and as a late-twenties punker who's been to every warped tour lemme just tell you...SCREAMING does not make you punk rock! It really just makes you another in a long line of bands ripping each other off for that rad Jawbreaker sound...or whatever it is they are going for. This comp has some strong material (Alkaline Trio, Bad Religion, The Lawrence Arms, many others) but also has more junk you've never heard of and probably shouldn't. They really should go back to one-disc comps of the really good PUNK on the warped tour and get all these 8th stage wack bands off the comp. Oh yeah, lots of that generic new pop-punk stuff too (yellowturd, taking back sunday, simple plan?!?!?!?!, et al ad nauseum). I got it free w/my warped tour tickets. I wouldn't pay a dime for this lame overdone comp. But it is about 30% rockin'."
3,Yup.,"In response to the review before me. I would like to say that just because a band isn't on the main stage doesn't mean that they aren't good. It's people like you that I hate at the warped tour, you try so hard to dress ""punk"" and go there and be the ""cool"" you. You don't even give the other bands that are playing on a smaller stage a chance. I'm sorry they don't play on the radio, so they can't be good, because everything on MTV is the only thing you should listen because they know good music. I hope you suffocate slowly listening to your damn music."
4,Awesome but Not Live,"CAUTION:THESE ARE NOT LIVE RECORDINGS LIKE THE OTHER WARPED DISCS.Nontheless, a great collection of music with a few mediocre songs."
5,Awesome!,"This CD is probably the best CD I've ever bought. There are a few well known bands on there, but you get introduced to some awesome little known bands. And those small bands are what makes this CD rock. Even if you cant go to the concert, this CD is still a must because every song on there is great (maybe with the exception of the atmosphere song)."
4,Good compilation,"This is a good CD. One problem, not anough punk music. Alot of it is Hard rock/metal. But there are some really good song. NOFX,Alkaline trio, The lamrence arms and jersey are a few. For seven bucks Warped tour fans should defenantly by this album."
3,Not as good as the last one,"i was kind of dissapointed wit this cd. its got some cool tracks in Flogging Molly, Bouncing Souls, Real McKenzies, The F-Ups, The Matches, Pennywise, Anti-flag, NOFX, and Bad Religion. it is not as good as 2003's though. I wouldnt recommend this unless you are a diehard fan, the unheard of bands are not that great (except for the Matches). i would definitely bu 2003 if you have not already instead of this one"
5,Adoption is another word for love,This is a lovely book to give as a gift to friends or family with adopted children and to all of your children themselves. The fact that the entries are written by those who have had the experience of being adopted or of being the adopting parent sends an arrow straight to the heart. It validates the feelings of those of us who have an adopted child in our life.
1,Printed Without Permission,"As touching and lovely as this book may be, it consists of material printed without permission from the original writers, and that is just wrong. I was shocked when an acquaintance told me that they'd read something of mine IN THIS BOOK. I was never contacted or compensated for the use of my words."
2,NOT LONG LASTING,"Christmas day i put this drill to the test. I was putting together my lil' sisters doll crib, something i figured to be minor. the strength of the drill was fair for the price but not the rechargable battery (word of advice don't buy a rechargable drill esp. at this price). The battery lasted between 5 to 10 minutes and that's being generous. i ended up manually putting the crib together by hand something i was not expecting to do. especially on a childrens toy."
4,"A bit slow, but OK on crosscuts","I didn't expect a cheap Western-style saw like this to work, but this one actually does.The teeth are very fine, with shallow gullets, making this saw best on crosscuts. It is not really fast enough on rip cuts for dovetails and box joints, although I do find it suited to cutting the shoulders of a shallow groove, because you can sneak up on the correct depth.There is a similarly-priced German ""professional dovetail saw"" on the market whose teeth have deeper gullets more suited to rip cuts. These two saws complement one another nicely.Although I am pretty good at sharpening most things, I haven't got down to really learning saws yet. So I buy mostly disposable ones. I find most cheap Western-style hardware store saws to be nearly useless, but this one really fills a role."
3,"ok, but not 100% thrilled","installation was easy as cake. it has alot of nice features. the part I am not satisfied with yet is that the reception is pretty fuzzy, and it doesnt seem to play in stereo sound, like the regular radio does.now take into consideration I do not know if both of these issues could be solved by using the optional radio input link, rather than the built in fm transmitter. but as of yet, without the link, reception and sound is poor.the channels and selection are awesome! the 80's channel alone is worth the $12.95 a month service fee!"
4,women thou art loved,"It's a book that holds ones interest and easily read. The author does a remarkable job making the Bible characters come alive and realistic. This book would be highly endorsed for women's church groups, small groups, or any discussion groups."
4,Very helpful and easy to understand.,"I am the first time coach of a second grade boys soccer team. This book was very easy to understand for the kids as well as myself. For kids that are relatively new to the game it explains positions, the different kinds of kicks and the all around basics of soccer without getting too technical. It has been a great aid for our team."
3,Light and cozy,"Herbalist and detective China Bayles is planning her wedding when a town development magnate is murdered. Not trusting her fiance, who is acting police chief, to solve the crime in time for their nuptials, China and her friends get on the trail. A subplot involving the daughter of China's dentist becomes part of the mystery. This one's as cozy as they come, with well meaning kids finding the murder weapon and a hurricane threatening to ruin the wedding. Lavender plays no part in the goings on, other than in its guise a a flower that signifies distrust and suspicion. Very light, quick reading."
4,Easy mystery,Love Susan Wittig Albert's books. This one was good. Easy reading while trying to figure out whodunit. Very surprised ending.
5,I want to be China Bayles!!!,"This is my first China Bayles mystery and I'm hopelessly hooked! China has my dream life: the herb shop, Thyme and Season; the tea room, Thyme for Tea; the sideline job of writing a gardening column for the local newspaper; not to mention the young hunk, Mike McQuaid!!! I think I better go back to the beginning, though, and work my way through the entire series. I love the herbal lore and recipes that begin each chapter as I have my own herb gardens. I didn't think China and McQuaid would EVER make it to the alter, but thankfully, they did in spite of murder, mayhem and a hurricane! Ms. Albert is a primo mystery writer and kept me guessing right up to the end. China's friends, Ruby, Smart Cookie, The Whiz, et al are icing on the cake of the plot, especially Ruby with her new age shop and flamboyant outfits. I highly recommend this book, especially if you're into herbs and love a good, fast-paced, well-written mystery!"
3,getting predictable,"Susan Wittig Albert's mystery novels are still enjoyable, but I'm beginning to figure out the ""pattern"" behind them. At the risk of committing a **SPOILER**, it seems that there is always one character who doesn't seem to have any reason to be in the book, just sort of shoehorned in, and that person always turns out to have done it. I hope the next few novels contain more twists."
2,Abridged Audio Annoying,"I'm a fan of China Bayles, but wouldn't be if my first exposure had been this abridged audio (Reader's Disgust version). Read by the author, who has entirely the wrong accent - more midwestern or simply generic, it starts out okay, but then becomes hurried, flat and deadpan. The story itself suffers mightly from the abridgement. A cozy needs the subplots and red herrings, but they were so numerous in this abridgement that it quickly became confusiong and rather non-sensical. I missed the little bits of herbal trivia I've come to expect, the richness of the characters was lacking, and generally I would have to say this audio is a mistake. Take a pass, and read the book."
3,"So far, so good","As of today, July 21, 2011, I am currently reading this book in the China Bayles mysteries. I'm not an herb person, but I like the characters, settings, and plots. My only problem with the writing is the use of foul language. So far, I haven't encountered it in this book. I just wish that authors didn't think they had to use such detestable words. You hear it enough in society, you certainly don't want to read it!"
3,Big mouth China,"Don't waste your time. Boy, what a boring mystery. Got tired reading about China's shop and her wedding. Also, if I were McQuaid, the Acting Police Chief, I'd tape China's mouth with some duct tape. Good thing he's not going to stay in that position, for all his police business would be all over Pecan Springs. China is supposedly helping her husband-to-be, McQuaid, with the town's murder mysteries. But she blabs all she knows to all her friends. She surely doesn't know how to keep quiet about evidence or clues. Of course, she solves the mysteries, but the whole town could have done the same for all knew what she knew."
4,The Best For Awhile!!,"This is a good China Bayles mystery. I was a little disillusioned after the previous two in the series, but this is a great one. I really enjoyed the story, and the wedding sideline was a great one. China is her usual rushed self in this story, and she's trying hard to concentrate only on her upcoming nuptials, but gets involved in spite of herself with another murder. This murder is of a citizen of Pecan Springs, who no one will really miss that much (except his wife). He's a sharpy, and he gets cut on his own misdeeds. The story moves along swiftly, and we see China trying to get wedding plans in amongst murders, hurricanes and faled wedding cakes. It's great. Read this for a whomping good ride."
1,ROBOJUNK,This eguipment is the biggest piece of junk I ever bought.Very cheap made plastic parts break if you look at them.Box broke the 1st day.If you intend on using this often on the job you will be sorley dissapointed.
3,The stars don't stay on the ceiling.,"I bought this hoping to decorate the ceiling above my bed with little glow in the dark stars. The only problem was that every single star fell down the next morning after I put them up, some on top of me during my sleep! The little sticky pads they give you to hang the stars with don't work well enough to hold them. I am going to see if I can still find a way to use the stars, possibly use sticky tack or something like that. But this kit does not come with stickers that actually work to hang them. When I first hung the stars however, they did glow really well and were pretty cool. The only problem I had was that they didnt' stay up. This kit would be really cool if all you wanted to do was make the star mobiles, which is one of the suggestions on the back of the package. Other than that, they kind of seemed like cheap junk."
4,Yummm-mmy,I bought this Bread Mix - It clearly stated it makes 2 loaves - what I had to to do was empty out contents so I could divide the mix to make 1 loaf at a time... Once I figured out how to cut this into 2 separate mixes I was ready to experiment. I made this on the White Bread Setting of my Machine (I was able to add the raisins and cinnamon chips). I only had to buy the raisins everything else was included. This bread came out so delish. Thanks for a great Product. I would recommend this to anyone with or without a bread machine.
1,Did not rise,I have made about 6 different types of bread since I bought a top of the line bread machine.I followed the instructions in this product but the bread did not rise.Not sure way. Either the yeast was dead or I did something wrong.Also if you have a 1 loaf bread machine this package is not very convenient as you have to split it.In addition the packaging is a pain.
1,Disappointing!,"After reading some good reviews, I was excited to make this cinnamon bread, but it turned out terribly.Didn't rise much and after baking was heavy and doughy. Terrible. Will never try this bread again."
2,Object to DVD-R,I object to Amazon selling and the studio releasing movies on DVD-R. This format will not last as long as the regular dvd's but is priced the same. To discourage the practice I will not buy DVD-R.
2,Hold on to your money and wait until prices drop,"RATING: C-C+. To anyone with knowledge of aviation, this movie is not an excellent movie or even an interesting movie; it is not remotely in the same league as The Bridges at To Ko Ri, The Right Stuff, Twelve O'Clock High, The High and the Mighty or Island in the Sky. The cast cannot overcome the unimaginative, unrealistic plot. It is a standard issue 1950's style movie, with a leaden dialogue and a better cast than it deserves. It is advertised for its ""exciting"" aviation sequences, but the flying sequences are few and far between, and not exciting or even credible from either an aviation or a military perspective."
3,"Great aviation time capsule, not so great plot-","This film is partially based on the treatment of some actual pilots, like WW II and Korean War ace Walker Mahurin, that were captured by the North Koreans and tortured into signing fake confessions of atrocities. Some of these men were treated pretty badly by the Air Force upon their return to America. William Holden's character is one of those men. The real reason to watch this is the really impressive shots of Edwards AFB during the early years of the jet age. The panorama of real aircraft on the ramp and the aerial photography are the best parts of the film."
5,HELP!!!,"This is what I thought when I got stuck in the fourth mission of the game. I bought this Strategy Guide and all my problems were gone. I could play every mission and, more important, every bonus mission in the game.I think nobody can play this game without using this guide at least once. I would really recommend it to anyone who admits that he's stuck in the game!"
4,You will need this!,"With the little help of this book, you can reach EVERY bonus missions without losing any one of them. Of course, you can try it hard by yourself. But, I bet, you need this at least once ...... So ......"
5,Great DVD,Last Man Standing is a very enjoyable DVD. It's a great buy for anyone who is a Jerry Lee Lewis fan. I highly recommend this DVD.
4,A Rock and Roll Street Brawl,"Make no mistake. The star of this CD is the piano playing of Jerry Lee Lewis. The boozy duets with George Jones, Merle Haggard, Ringo Starr and Keith Richards are as comfortable as your favorite slippers. But the true highlight of this CD is the street brawl between Jerry Lee's piano and the guitar of Jimmy Page, on ""Rock and Roll"". The track opens with a typical Page high octane riff, followed by the Killer saying, ""This IS rock and roll!"" You sense a battle brewing: the kid gunslinger (OK, middle-aged gunslinger), looking for the legend. And the legend doesn't back down. The battle for supremacy between the piano and the guitar rages at a furious pace, reminiscent of a John Wayne-Richard Widmark fist fight, rolling in a dusty street, both relishing the battle. One gets the sense that Lewis and Page call it a draw at the end, put their arms around each other, and walk back into the bar. This IS a new classic of rock and roll."
4,Absolutely Amazing!,This CD is full of amazing energy and the laciviousness that has always marked Jerry Lee. Age doesn't seem to have mellowed him much at all. His voice and especially his piano playing are still a wonder. Most duet CD's don't work but on this one there are few real duets. Mostly other singers are just trying to keep up with Jerry Lee. There is no question that this is HIS album and he is the dominant force. He is a nut but an amazing talent.
3,A depressing tribute to a great performer past his prime,"Jerry Lee Lewis has always been an awesome piano player whose live performances have been legendary for his energetic and lightning fast playing. He has always been loud, fast, and wild, in the past.I watched this DVD today, I noticed something that few did or even dare to mention. No disrespect intended to Mr. Lewis or any of his other fans, but he is old and has slowed down tremendously. It's just not the same watching him. The energy is gone. The fire has gone out, so to speak.Yes, he still plays well. His voice sounds great. He just does not have that sparkle that he once had. For that reason, I can not bring myself to watch this again. I will gladly bring out an older concert of his, instead."
1,No Performances - Only Know-Nothings Interrupting,"The so-called experts interrupt everything that starts on this dvd, except each other. There are some fake voice-overs as if one or more of the so-called stars are actually singing. This is like most tributes- made to make money for the who-cares bunch of nothings. I am ashamed to have called Jerry Lee Lewis my friend. I hope he never speaks to me again."
5,The Killer puts you under on this one,"You may be surprised at a creaky, chubby Jerry Lee, but at least you know he's no longer doing speed, even though he still plays like it. This terrific show has an all-star backup band featuring Ronnie Wood and lovely backup singers in a beautiful setting. Unlike most tribute shows, the interviews are brief and pertinent. (No ""What did Woopie Goldberg think about the Beatles?"" type questions.) Nice brief history of Jerry Lee is interwoven into the show, which is excellent on every song. Sound is very good although we lose one of Ronnie's solos. The hits are here, along with some lovely weepers. You can't go wrong on this one, I am so happy they did this show. Money well spent."
5,Last Man Standing - Best man Standing,"A piece of Rock`n Roll history, should not be missed by anyone who appreciates the best rock'roll pianist / singer of all time."
5,Wonderful CD,"This is a great CD if you like the boogie woogie style paino. So many wonderful voices have paired up with Jerry for this one, you can't help but like some of the songs, and fortunately I liked them all. Perhaps my favorite is he with B.B. King--a wonderful piece. This is not a perfectly orchestrated CD, and the ""soul"" comes through."
5,Jerry Lee Lewis is always a great musician.,Nice product. PBS was selling this product for a $200.00 donation. Norah Jones was especially good!
3,Some good ones...some so-so recordings,"Some of these recordings made us chuckle with memories - some of the songs were done a lot better earlier...overall, I'm happy with the purchase..."
1,didnt get it,its been over a month and i havent received it. has anyone else had to wait so long for a shipment to arrive?
3,"OK Album, not great","Bought this album for ONE song, ""Rock and Roll"", which is classic Jerry Lee Lewis at the keyboard. The rest of the album is tolerable, but hardly worth the price."
4,still The Killer at 71,"I first saw these videos while PBS was having its beg-a-thon and was totally impressed with the performances. It is quite a tribute to JLL that so many top stars want to perform with him. Even at 71 years old, he still has that spark even if his body can no longer keep up. I wish that all the duets from the CD had been on the DVD. If you get the DVD, get the CD also."
4,The Killer kills,"I loved this DVD.If you're a Jerry Lee Lewis fan I'm pretty sure you will also.There's country, blues, rock and roll, all in the unique Jerry Lee style.We all know Jerry Lee is a little crazy however when it comes to music he's one of a kind and a member of the great pioneers of Rock and Roll.I can't get enough of that music and I will be watching this DVD many many times over."
4,Return of a Dinosaur,"The Killer is back. Not neccessarily in prime condition, but the entire album is one big excersize in showing them kids who's the King of Rock'n'Roll (after all, Elvis has been dead for ages now!). Jerry Lee rocks with a little help from his friends, and what a joy it is to listen to."
5,"Thrilled Jerry Lee is ""Still Standing""","I have been a fan of Jerry Lee for 50 years. Everytime I think he can't get any better, he does. I am so glad he has not faded with time, but has grown even brighter. This cd is wonderful and everyone should find more than a few songs they enjoy on this one. When his career crashed in the late 50's I never dreamed he would be doing great work like this a half a century later. Just goes to show you can't hide a ""God given talent"" like Jerry Lee's. Right on, Jerry."
3,Nothing to write home about!,"As a ""Killer"" fan from day one I've thoroughly enjoyed virtually everything Jerry Lee ever recorded. ""Last Man Standing"" is pretty much a hodge podge of vintage songs by a man who has lost more than a step or two in the vocal department and has been packaged as a series of duets with top name performers. There's no question that this is Jerry Lee's show, as it should be. Most of the guest artists have minimal contributions and some of the tracks work much better than others.Overall this is a fairly enjoyable collection but I sadly found myself hoping that this was the Killer's last recording session. No disrespect intended to a legend but at this point he seems to be coming close to just running on fumes. Nevertheless I would recommend this to all JLL fans simply because this is the ""mother-humpin'""JERRY LEE LEWIS and there will never be another one like him."
4,Way too much Jerry Lee,"I have loved Jerry Lee Lewis since the 50s, and have seen him perform live several times. I was eager to hear his latest because of the great reviews it was getting, not only from publications like Rolling Stone, but from The New Yorker as well. Too, I was impressed by the line-up of musicians involved in this duet album. However, in many cases, it's difficult to hear the other musicians, because Jerry Lee is always up front (Trading lines with Rod Stewart on ""What made Milwaukee Famous"" is an exception.). As well, does he have to reference himself in every single number? On other, older albums in my collection, he maybe did this once or twice at the most; hearing Ol' Jerry Lee do this on all 21 numbers gets old after a while. We KNOW who's singing the song, Jerry--you don't have to keep reminding us!"
4,Last Dance for a great rock piano player,"Jerry lee Lewis... you can imagine the hyjinks.Well at hitting on 80 years he ain't got the foot on the piano,but he still playes strongly, and his voice is in good form.Classic rock n roll, with a bunch of his fansjoining him for a cut or two each.These fans are mostly household names in the music world,and clearly are happy to be on this.It was originally intended as a solo album, but as time went on,it became a series of duets with other greats joining Jerry Lee in HIS World.and pulling it off well. Put this on at a Thanksgiving party andit just got replayed and never taken off all night.A year back I opened up for Jerry Lee with a band at a festival,I am glad we didn't have to follow him.I was much looking forward to getting this album.And wasn't disapointed.There is also some fine instrumental work including somefine pedal steel players and bluesy guitarists.But centered around Jerry Lee's rolling piano."
5,This Is Red Hot n' Rockin',"Worth waiting for this is a killer album,great version of the Led Zep track Rock'n'Roll.The Beatles,I saw her standing there is brilliant.I really like his version of John Fogerty's Travellin' Band as well.The others on the album are worthy of a listen depending on your taste in music,for his age he can still pump that piano I love it."
5,Still Has Thunder,"Although the voice is a bit strained the keyboards still explode in many of these fine duets. The range of music is interesting from rock standards like Pink Cadillac with the Boss, to blues with Clapton, to ballads with Willy Nelson. Although all are worth a listen the old war horse duets between Killer and George Jones, and he and Willie Nelson are true classics. There is a lot of talent on this CD but they all pay homage to Jerry's legacy, and the thunder in his left hand."
2,Woolie for starters / amateurs only,"If you use this thing for your home project only, that's fine. I'm a commercial artist and need something to withstand lots of abuse every day. The plastic handle will eventually break and the glue, which holds the wool pad on the handle, is cheap crap & will separate from the handle within the first few times of use. Can be re glued (gorilla glue or 2 part epoxy works great). Huge plus for this one sold here, it's very light !! When you do 2000sqft of faux finishing walls, you know, what I'm talking about :-) If you are a professional, you'll have problems with this."
4,Woolie works wonders.,"We used the Woolie for, 3 color meshing. This was a first attempt, and we had excellent results.However, about half way into the project one corner and ajoining edge lost all of it's wool. This caused a minor setback. Overall it is a great product."
2,Amateurs beware.,I read the description and watched the video but found that my lack of skill in faux finishing did not improve with the use of the product. I ended up wasting money on glaze and another can of paint to cover the poor execution of my faux finish.
5,Matthews Makes the BEST grip equipment,"Matthews has been selling C stands and other grip equipment for years in Hollywood, CA. It you know anything about the film industry or are in the film industry, you have used them many time and over. This is a quality product and I highly recommend it."
1,Do not bother,"I bought this collection because of the price, and well, I guess if you want a 5 dollar haircut your going to get a 5 dollar haircut.This film reminds me of 6th grade, the way it's narrarted and its content. Don't expect to see any battle footage, it mostly covers logistics of how the United States was able to setup bases, etc. Which may sound somewhat interesting, but if your looking for events, battles, etc. do not purchase."
2,Madacy is milking the Vietnam war footage.,"A better set is ""Vietnam War with Walter Cronkite"".It is 12 hours long. Madacy appears to have severalsets of identical content with different packaging.Outright crooks. Anything that says Madacy Entertainmenton the box, just leave it be. This isn't even worth 1 star."
4,Nice,"Shipped in good time, looks very nice in our kitchen. The only problem we had is that the little knob on the drawer had to be glued on. Other wise I recommend this table."
1,Horrible!,"This is the worst costume I have ever bought. It does NOT look like the picture. It is definitely neon yellow, tight, the white panel in the front is a foot longer, and the dress absolutely does not touch the ground. This is huge false advertisement and a definite WASTE OF MONEY. Do not buy this!!!"
5,The life of Mac MacClean,This is the story of one man's life in the Yellowstone country. It must have been wonderful then to live in freedom and the beauty of that part of the world.Anyone would enjoy reading about this man and his life and family at this time. It is a very exciting read. Amazon is so great to bring all these wonderful books to us!
5,hm..,"This is the first time I have seen this release (both ""Imprint"" and ""S/T"" on one CD) I have both of these albums individually and they are amazing! I would recommend buying this CD to get both albums at the same time. Just to let you VOD fans know, there is a new band from the ashes of VOD called ""Bloodsimple"" and here is a link if your interested:www.bloodsimpleband.com"
2,I was disappointed,"I got this cd because I liked the song ""I'm Diggin' it"" and it was a fun song. When I got the cd it was mostly sad slow songs. Only 2 fast songs, and those are the ones I like. Her newest release it ""You wanna what?"" and I liked that song and 'I'm diggin it'. She dosen't have that great of voice either."
1,I aint diggin it,"When I first heard I'm diggin it on CMT, I could've sworn it was another Britney Spears. How can this even be classified as country? She sounds like a teeny bopper! There's no doubt she has a great voice, but she needs to actually sing great songs. If you're a fan of Britney Spears or Shania Twain, buy this. But if you're like me, and want real country, by Lee Ann Womack, Sara Evans, or Patty Loveless."
3,some say Im running,The album was Ok being her first but I didnt like the fact that she redid Martina Mcbride's song (some say Im running) Martina sang it so much better. So maybe if she didnt add other peoples songs to her album she might just get a better review.
4,good cd...some nice tracks,fave songs:some people fallim waiting for youthats the only wayi enjoyed this cd....i do agree her voice could mature a bit more but the style is sweet
4,What a CD!,"I received Alicia's CD in my R&R magazine as a promo, and it's fantastic! She's got great sound, a terrific voice, and I can't wait to hear more of her on the radio. She gives individuality and life to each song. Best of luck!"
2,Haven't Heard It But.....,"Personally, Alecia's singing is just a little too throaty for my taste, and I've heard her be downright raspy. I do agree that she is pushing to be like Britney Spears...I mean, look at her 'Diggin It' video, it bears a AMAZING reselmblence to Britney's 'Baby, Baby'.I credit Alecia, for however, going out there and not being afraid to sing songs about absinence and things like that. I'd recommend you skip her, and head right for Jessica Andrews."
1,Irony meets boredom,"There's nothing worth reading - the cover is the most exciting part of the book. And in case you haven't already heard, the author is a fervent supporter of the terrorist group, the IRA, responsible for killing thousands - including hundreds of civilians in random bombings in bars and department stores. According to the author, IRA terrorism is acceptable because it's not against the United States. Don't support this filth. Ignore the book, shun the author."
1,"Horrible, Worst Book I've read in a long time","Save you money! (especially in this economy). Book is supposed to be in fiction section, however, I think it should be in the Rapid, Right-Wing Republican Fantasy secion. This book is simply a thinly-veiled excuse to insult and incite a group of loyal Americans who happened to be of the Islamic faith.But I guess if you like poorly written and uninteresting policitcal chest-thumping, this book is for YOU!"
1,A waste of money- Recall the Author,"As a terrorist supporter himself, and general all around insane bigot this gentleman has no place in politics. The book is poorly written lacks anything substantial, a waste of money."
1,"Bigotry, racism, and hatred","Dear Readers,I was astonished and utterly disgusted, abhorred, appalled, displeased, grossed out, nauseated, nauseous, offended, outraged, repelled, repulsed, sickened and totally turned off by this book. As a house representative, Peter King should be ashamed of how low he has sank in an attempt to get ratings for his book. His actions epitomizes those who have no honor and dignity and would sink as low as possible to attain publicity. I can only begin to imagine how much hate and racism is kindling in his heart. It takes an enormous amount of ""EVIL"" in someone's heart to write such a book, and I would strongly request all my fellow American to not waste a dime on this book. His views and attempts to create a division amongst American citizen's is vile and very dangerous, and I urge my fellow Americans to vote against him in future elections, for someone who can bring America together as oppose to divide them."
3,Uneeded Profanity!,The chapters were set up in such a way that was sort of confusing (fiction v. nonfiction). The profanity was unecessary and offensive in a book of this subject. Editing could of done a better job.
4,Congressman King's Latest - A Must Read to Understand 9/11,"This book hooks you right away. It is a clever piece of fiction that mixes personal reminiscences about 9/11 and a futuristic look at another potential terrorist strike. His 9/11 story is teeming with emotion. His real life account of life on Capitol Hill in the days following 9/11 are compelling. King educates us on the need to remember 9/11 -- especially the firefighters and police and other workers who led the efforts at Ground Zero. And, he reminds us of the need for continued vigilance.It is a fine piece of fiction and overall a good read."
2,Terrible!,"My daughter loves Bratz and asked for this doll. After only a few days, we put it in her closet and it started talking all by itself, even when we took out the batteries. It scared her so bad we had to give it away."
4,Works for itchy skin and shedding,"This vitamin reduces itching, scratching, and shedding in our yellow lab. We definitely noticed an increase in itching and shedding when the dog stopped taking the vitamins after having them daily for many months. No problem getting him to eat them - he just crunches them up; thinks they are a treat. We toss one in his bowl on top of his food and he waits eagerly and then gobbles up the vitamin first. They are gel-caps so I guess if your dog won't eat them it would be easy enough to cut them open with a pair of scissors and squeeze the oil into the food."
3,china RULES,"This is an ok tool , the chuck is kind of crappy and it's doubtful it will last .if the rest holds up replace it with a Jacobs key type [$32.00]I would use this drill for small jobs around the house,not on the job . But it's cheap enough .I can remember paying $185.00 for a 1/4"" B&D; drill when they were made in Maryland , 30 years later it still works fine ,just had to replace the cord.I'm sure the current crop of tools will have a short useful life.An update, the batteries are shot , it's history as feared.after limited usage."
5,Great Drill for the Money!!!!!,"I received this drill as a Christmas gift from my wife, I would have to say the best gift I received in 2008! There is power to spare. Easy to use and hold. The 2 batteries and how fast they recharge keeps me on task to get the job done quickly."
5,"Great performance, amazing value","I bought the Skill 2887-03 as part of a combo set including the drill/driver, circular saw, reciprocating saw and jigsaw. Needless to say, I've been extremely pleased.I put hardwood flooring on three floors (2000+ square feet) and used the set extensively. From cutting plywood for the subfloor and underlayment with the circular saw to making curved cuts in the hardwood with the jigsaw. The drill/driver was used to screw in over a thousand screws to secure the underlayment, drill numerous holes, stir paint, mix mortar for the tile, etc. And with two batteries, you'll be able to have one charging always ready to go. The only corded tools I used for this project were my compound miter and jamb saw. Everything else was done with the cordless Skil combo set.I was so pleased with the tools, I bought two more sets, one for myself and one for my dad for father's day.Highly recommended."
2,Great Drill. Bad Batteries.,"I bought my Skil several years ago. I got an excellent year out of it, then Skil replaced the batteries at the end of its warranty. Then I got another great year out of it. Since then, I had to charge the batteries immediately before each use, and now they won't charge at all.Replacing the batteries costs as much as the new product.So, it's an excellent disposable drill, but not a long-term tool to add to a collection.Skil (or a 3rd party) should sell replacement batteries."
3,somehat disappointing,The batteries don't seem to hold a charge very well/long. It appears in less than a week (with NO use) the batteies are a third drained.
1,batteries are useless,"The drill is OK. Transmission box is a little weak, will pop out at high torgue, but OK. The batteries suck. Hard to get in and out. Don't hold a charge on their own for more than a day or so. Run out of power in the middle of small job. Honestly, I don't know how you'd design such bad batteries. Even a cheap car battery holds a charge for weeks.The odds of getting both batteries charged up for a weekend job is slim. I only use this occasional, and it's very disappointing. Going to look for a nice Lithium-ion unit and toss this one."
4,Adequate for light duty jobs,"I like Skil products but they are not top of the line, long lasting tools and you shouldn't expect them to be for the price you are going to pay. However, around the house I love my drill/drivers (I have three Skill drivers). I have recently purchased the lithium ion batteries for the drivers but, again, they don't stack up to higher quality tools. I took the drill to a job site 8.5 hours away from the house with no electricity and the batteries wore down very quickly so I ended up using a coworkers old Ni battery DeWalt hammer drill which outperformed the Skil mercilessly. Again, buy the Skil for light to medium duty work and you will be pleased; otherwise, stick with higher end models if you're looking for something more along a professional line."
1,Complete piece of junk!!!!!,"Looks good two batteries and charger included. Good deal? NO_NO_NO- the clutch in this thing is made of cheese. It started slipping on the 2nd job I did with it. Left me out in the field twiddling my thumbs.I don't know what possessed me to pick this one, but it was sure a waste of my money and my time!!!!"
5,Nice Drill,"I love this drill. With variable sspeed and torque controls, and the power of 18v for a low price. I can't believe they even include an extra batterey. I had a 14v drill previously that I paid the same amount for that only came with 1 battery"
3,1 year old,Whe I first purchased this drill I loved it. Have had this drill for about 1 year now and the batteries do not hold a charge. I work in the crane industry and I need a cordless drill with some balls that can drill more than 1 hole when im working aloft.
1,Save your money,"DO NOT BUY THIS DRILL/DRIVER. I have three complaints with this tool.1) The battery is so hard to remove, it takes two people and a rubber mallet to remove it. Putting a new one in is OK.2) A newly charged battery has very little charge. I am not a professional woodworker, but in my do-it-yourself projects I have to change batteries mid job.3) The drill bit is not in line with the axis of the drill itself. This is over-comeable by concentrating on the drill bit and make sure it is straight. If you concentrate on the drill, your hole will be slanted.My previous tool was a DeWalt. I bought the Skill because DeWalt discontinued the battery for my model. DeWalt is the tool I would recommend."
1,Don't waste your money,"Not only are the batteries a pain to remove, their performance is horrible. My unit is less than a year old with light use and the batteries wont hold a charge when sitting on the shelf out of the tool even with a fresh charge they don't have a whole lot of life to them. My old Makita I bought in 1995 still had far superior battery performance to this piece of junk. Unfortunately I gave the makita away when I bought this thing, bad move."
5,A neat excursion into relativistic space travel,This is a book that I first read over ten years ago. The story and the physics intrigued me and I've never forgotten it. Recently I decided to reread it and discovered that I'd given my copy to someone. I bought this copy and was pleased to see how well the story has held up. Not your typical space opera. A good read.
4,An unusual but very creative story,I liked this story very much because of the authors capability of describing G-space (hyperspace or whatever you want to call it) and the environment of a ship moving at faster than light speed. I have read better though.
3,"Interesting reading, but quite dry","Ernest L. Abel's book on Jewish Genetic Disorders, is written from the common person, where he tries to explain which disorders show up disproportionally in the Jewish population. He has chapters divided by the organ systems the disease affects. Abel discusses such heartbreaking diseases like Tay-Sachs, and other more obscure diseases. Abel's writing is quite dry, but I read through it quick enough. 3 stars"
1,HORRIBLE RECEPTION (except maybe in small areas),"I live in a three story A-Frame (wood) and use a 2Wire 1000SW G. I purchased this product to replace my DWL650+ pc card since it would drop from 22mb to 11mb from the first to the third floor (router being on first fl.), and so with this adapter's outside mounted anntena and ratings herein I calculated that this adapter would solve my problems. WRONG I either did not receive signal or reported a 1mb connection. Heck even my Toshiba PPC with its Sandisk Compact Flash adapter gets better signal at 2mb in the same location and in comparasion the receiving anntena of the MS 2.0 USB adapter is 25 times larger. Size is often not better! Very unhappy about claims versus realtiy. But thx to Amazon for FREE returns. Later guys....."
4,Good Wireless Adapter,"My PC is hardwired to my DSL modem with a Microsoft Network Base Station (802.11b Network). It's pretty old, but hey it works and as long as it does everything is good. Anyway, the PC is in the basement and I bought this for my sons PC (located on the second floor). I have to say the reception is pretty good. My daughter also has a older Microsoft wireless adapter on her PC and when all three of us are online it's really not that slow.All in all good buy!!"
5,Me markers I want,"This is such a great brand. I use only them when coloring in my books. Just to let off steam from doing housework,getaway from everybody. I can color anywhere even on vacation. I can always come back to my coloring work & it looks as if I did it yesterday.I always date it that's how you leave your mark. And if I let my cousin's,niece's & nephew's color in them . I tell them to write your name & the date. Come back 2 years later and it looks fresh as the day you did it. Giggles66"
2,"""Rise From the Grave, Little Sister...""","Another double-up CD release of these classic King Diamond albums, ""Them"" & Conspiracy. Although, teaming these two CDs together is no-brainer, it's better you purchase these two releases seperately(if you haven't already got 'em) Most hard-core Diamond fans will undoubtedly have these in their collection. But I guess this product might appeal to fans that are being turned onto the King for the first time.But in my opinion, these double-up CD releases are superfulous. It just seems like a feeble attempt from Roadrunner to cash in AGAIN on a artist they barely promoted in the first place..."
2,Bring back the old times,"I would appreciate if the owner of giga pets, Nano pets, And the wonderful Tamagotchi owner just brought them back up. Come on guys, gals, and animals. Don't we just love those keychain demanding pals. Not a Pal that all ya get to do is give it watts, play a game, Walk, Skip, or jump (whatever ya do). Also ya cant feed it Train it and it dont get old, JUST THE BATTERIES!I Just Wish they could Bring Them Back! Sure Digimon are fun has better features than that ol GS. Can ya feed it? NO!at least they have nano fighters Not any more gosh give me a break. C-ya Peace"
2,BORING!,i bought this but you can't hardly do anything with it just a boring card game.it's so boring whats the use in buying it.it was so boring that right now i dont even know where it is and i dont plan to look for it.
4,Pikachu review,I think this is much cooler that the original virtual pets. Pickachu does not stay on all of the time and it is not demading. The activities are neat to watch. I f you give Pikachu watts it will do an activity in return. My favorite activity is to see Pikachu writing.
4,Fun and useful!,I really adore this thing. I used to have one back in the late 90's when it came out and then recenetly rediscovered it. I think it's excellent to encourage kids (and anyone who loves pokemon lol) to get out there and exercise and walk. I know it gets me moving!
1,Hard keeper,"This is the hardest virtual pet to take care of. Unless you jog a couple of miles everyday it's extremely hard to get the watts to give to pikachu, as the only game on it is a slot game which you normally lose at. The one good thing about it is that it has a battery saver feature where his screen will shut down when you aren't pushing buttons, so the batteries last a VERY long time. I got mine probably over 2 years ago and he still works perfectly today. I don't recommend this one, it takes too much effort to keep him. If you don't give him enough watts he gets unhappy and eventually runs away."
3,Not for use with a table,"This is a good entry level router so long as it is used upright. Inverting the router under a table will create issues. The main problem is that the clamp does not have the sufficient strength to hold at a fixed depth when it's inverted. After taking great pains to adjust the depth, you will find that as soon as you turn the router on, the depth will change. Also, since the router is trigger-operated, you will have to engage the trigger lock when it's inverted under a table. The trigger lock is a pretty flimsy piece of plastic, and it didn't take more than a couple of days for mine to break. Once that happens it will have to be repaired before it can be used under a table again.My advice: buy Bosch."
3,Holds up to abuse,"I would agree with the other reviewers about this router being difficult to adjust with any degree of accuracy, but I found that once you took the pains to set it up properly, it held its depth pretty good - even inverted - which a lot of the other reviewers complained about. What I liked most about it was that it took a heck of a beating. I'm hard on tools and this one was dropped, banged on and ridden hard and it lasted surprisingly long - longer than the Craftsman I owned before this one. Eventually it did give out (what do you expect for 50 bucks) but I got my money's worth out of it. Definitely not for pros, just because it's such a pain to set up, but for the weekend warrior like myself, it was a pretty good tool. I'm in the market again for a router and did consider getting another one of these, but I think I'm going to step up to a better quality tool just because I think it'll be quicker and easier to set up and I find that I'm getting less patient and tolerant with age."
1,makes a better anvil than router,"I got this for use with a skil router table. ASOLUTELY CANNOT NOT ADJUST with any degree of accuracy. I will say that after taking a claw hammer to the thing the cast iron base broke after a couple of strikes, but the plastic housing took a brutal beating without busting. It may be allright for someone wanting an upright router, but don't even consider it for use with a table."
3,Durable but not comfortable,"I've had this bag for close to 9 years now, and it's lasted through multiple trips overseas and being used as carry-on luggage (which always gets a beating). It's kept my equipment safe through all of it, so those are the pros.Cons: comfort. Sling bag seems like a good idea - easy to put on and take off - but after an hour or so of walking around a city, it hurts to have all the weight unevenly positioned. In addition, there is little padding on the strap. I suffered through wearing it for many years, but finally purchased a Kata backpack instead. Also, as another reviewer mentioned, there's no place for a waterbottle to fit on the outside of the bag. I use a caribener to hook my nalgene to it, but that only exacerbates the uneven weight issue.Overall, fits equipment well and protects it, but can't say that I recommend it due to level of discomfort while wearing."
5,Impassioned Machaut performances,"The title of the disc is somewhat of a misnomer -- not all of the pieces here are from the Remede de Fortune, but this is no complaint. All of these are performed with instrumental accompaniment (lute, vielle, symphonia, harp), which works especially well for the solo songs (I'll admit I can't listen to solo voice a capella for very long!). All the vocal performances are extremely good, ranging from sweet to visceral, even (to risk being labeled a ponce) bluesy. Just listen to ""Tels rit au main qui au soir pleure"", you'll see what I mean."
3,Remede de Fortune,"Some truly nice performances, except...one of the tenors is clearly singing out of his range. One feels compelled to skip this track. Also, very scant liner notes, none, in fact. It might be nice to see the text. Not nearly as compelling as their Ars Subtilior interpretations."
3,not detailed...very general overview of various green buildings,"book is small format. covers about 50 building/urban projects which utilize green energy. however, most analysis is only one page to 2 page including diagrams and photos, and without any detail summary. the author have divided the book in sections such as ""air we breath, skyscraper garden, energy, construction, and etc"". Despite a clear outline, he uses too many buildings with very little detail instead of just using 1 or 2 buildings in great detail for each topic.unfortunately, this book is more of a guidebook of the latest green energy buildings with brief description.I would not buy this book unless you find it at super bargain price (like $10-15). this should be 2 stars instead of 3 but I cannot change due to Amazon's editing function."
3,Information on the Surface,"The book was a bit dissapointing. I anticipated reading more indepth detail about the featured projects with diagrams/pictures of the major energy efficient application. Instead the information is only on the surface. It provides beautiful pictures of the building, with two page excerpts of each project (mainly pictures with a paragraph description), a list of the energy efficient applicatios and small floor plans and elevations, if any. A few projects feature the sustainable application methods, such as a diagram of natural ventilation. Overall, it's a good reference to start your research and find a sustainable building to research on, but the information is limited. It's also a good reference for lists of sustainable applications, definitions and essays. The projects are also divided up in five categories: Energy, Light & Air, Greenery Water & Waste, Construction and Urbanism. There are a lot of projects within each category that will spark your interest."
1,Not Lignomat comes from General Tools,This is a case of bait and switch. They show pictures of the Lignomat but send you the General brand. It may still be the same item PTH8708 however Lignomat carries a certain brand distinction and General is considered low rent district tools
5,an essential first wave surf band,"If you enjoy instrumental surf music, this double length album is for you. The Sentinels are the quintessential first wave surf band."
3,good flag,"like the flag but the pole is not the greatest, i found myself just tacking the flag in my window so the logo is always visible as if you had outside on pole you need wind to make flag move around and have logo appear other wise it just sit on poll hanging down"
4,Repetition repetition repetiteon,"The first song of this release, ""At Giza"" is almost a bit jazzy, with the group chanting and droning menacingly to a mellow beat. The release only has two songs - the other is ""Flight of the Eagle"" - but they are both long - 33:23. The drone is menacing, heavy, mellow. It starts, it proceeds, then it just goes on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and om and on and on and on and om and on and on and on, and on and on and om and on and on and on and om and on and on and on, and om and on and on and on and on and on, and om and on and on and on and on, and on and on and on and om and on, and on and on and on and on and on and om and on and on and on, and on and on and on and on, and om and on and on and on..."
5,Omkara,"The CD came a few days later than stated, but I personally have no problem with waiting time. I purchased the CD used, and it came in the exact condition as stated by the seller. The CD plays perfect, the case in great condition, and overall I couldn't be happier with it."
1,JUNK - A Sheep In Wolf's Clothing,"Do not be fooled by the appearance (and substantial weight) of this tool. It looks like it would last a lifetime. Unfortunately, as the other reviews have noted, the mechanism is junk. This is by far the worst Black & Decker tool I have ever owned. The clutch/selector mechanism failed after 4 uses. I've had B&D tools that lasted for 20+ years. If this is the quality of tool that they are putting out now, I won't be buying another. If you buy this one, you will be sorry. I wouldn't pay $10 for it, as I'm not sure most users would finish their first job with it. Junk...Junk....Junk."
1,Same as below. Aweful drill,"I purchased this drill a good while ago and have used it for many drilling operations, mainly in metal and wood. but the first time I tried to use it as a hammer drill the forward selector switch burnt out. I can use it in reverse though.What a peice of junk.Stay away from this product unless you want to get halfway through a project and throw it in the trash."
3,Good but not superb from the Discworld,"Sourcery has re-entered the Discworld after a fairly quiet millenia without it. The eighth son of an eighth son of an eighth son has been born, bringing with him an excess of magic. With this magic, the faintly ridiculous wizards of the Disc World become slightly more ridiculous but much more dangerous. Rincewind the incompetent wizard is at... well, not his best, but certainly his most Rincewindish and we meet Conina, daughter of Cohen the Barbarian. The eternal wisdom of the Librarian of the Unseen University (the wizard's university), summed up as ""Ook"" also gets some much deserved attention.This installment of the Discworld series is a showcase for Rincewind, but otherwise does not sparkle the way other Discworld books do. I enjoyed it once, but do not reach for it to re-read it the way I do others in the series."
4,One of the Best Discworld books,"It wasn't THE best, but it was definitely worth the read. Like all Rincewind novels, this one was hilarious. Especially when Rincewind has conversations with his conscience and his libido...It's better than The Colour of Magic, and about as good as the Light Fantasttic. It is of course about a 10 year old Sourcerer who leads all the Wizards in what is kind of like a Mage Wars, and Rincewind and Conina the hairdresser travel to Klatch with the Archchancellor's hat. They find themselves with Nijel the Destroyer, a teenager who wants to be a Barbarian hero. The Librarian tells (or rather ""Ook""s) Rincewind that he must save the World and destroy the Sourcerer. This is where the famous half-brick in the sock originates."
5,One of the best...,"This is by far one of Pratchett's funniest installments in the DiskWorld series. His powers of observational humor as well as his ability to turn a phrase on its side are simply amazing. I sat reading this book in a local pub and found myself stopping to read passages aloud to my wife, who, though not a fan of the genre, was laughing right along with me.If you fear the horsemen of the Apocalypse what will you do when you encounter the ""pedestrians of the Apocalypse""? Would you have a drink with them? What good is a workaholic Genie who has overcommitted himself? You'll find the answers to these and many more questions in Sourcery."
4,Another Wonderful Discworld Novel,"Terry Pratchett's Discworld Series is definitely one of my favorites. In Sourcery, the entire Disc is threatened by the sudden rise of wizards. The wizards are lead by one of the most feared people on the Disc, a sourcerer. What exactly is a sourcerer? The source of all magic, of course. The eighth son of an eighth son is, of course, a wizard. There was once a wizard that went out and had seven sons. His eighth son was a wizard squared -- a sourcerer. The sourcerer is the most powerful wizard ever, and with his coming, the powers of all the wizards has grown tremendously. With an evil staff urging him forward, the sourcerer and the wizards want to rule the Disc. They are apparently unstoppable. The hope of the Disc rests on the inept shoulder of Rincewind. Terry Pratchett is hilarious, and his stories are always witty and intriguing, and intelligent as well."
4,Hilarious!,"It wasn't exactly Pratchett's best, but daggonit it was FUNNY! I especially liked the conversation between Death and Ipslore...(""What is there in life that makes living worthwhile?"" ""CATS. CATS ARE NICE."") Overall I recommend this book to...anyone! It's funny, has a good plot, and (best of all) it has the Luggage, Rincewind, Death, and the Librarian in it! I mean, what more could you want?"
1,"Great story, terrible format.","The story is typical Pratchett: funny, inventive, and thoroughly entertaining. The Kindle format, however, is a hot mess. Disclaimer: I bought the Kindle edition a year ago and just recently got around to reading, and being annoyed, by it so it's possible that improvements have been made. Meanwhile I'm stuck with an edition where the italics go on for pages, the typos and misspellings are rife and, worst of all, the footnotes (a very important part of Pratchett's humor) appear at the end of the book instead of at the bottom of the 'page.' Possibly there's some way to access the correct footnote immediately but I don't know what it is. Waily, waily, waily. I'll try again with another Pratchett title and report back..."
3,What was this Book making Fun of?,"When the last sourceror has returned to Ankh-Morpork to become the head of the unversity, true magic and power is revealed. During this, Rincewind has run away (as usual) and goes to Klatch with Cohen the Barbarians daughter Conina. They also meet a very funny character called Nijel. A story full of magic, power, destiny and sourcery.This book was entertaining but JUST a bit boring in some parts. But the thing that really made me angry was that I couldn't find out what this book is making fun of. Klatch sounded like Africa, but Mr. Pratchett clearly said that it wasn't loosly based on it at all. Then I heard that this book was a spoof of the Arabien Knights but there was only a few elements that was the Aabien Knights.I would suggest this book if you like the Rincewind character, but if you like a book that makes you laugh of sattire copy then read The Truth, Moving Pictures, Eric, Soul Music."
4,Ultra-humorous fantasy novel,"Pratchett has a better sense of humor than any other author whose book(s) I've ever read. This book, the fifth in the Discworld series, is not quite as good as some of his later novels, but it's still quite funny. The part of this book with the over-committed genie was my favorite joke from this book. (Funny title also!)"
5,Wonderful! keeping up his standards for greatness!,simply loved it. i am a long-time Discworld fan and this book was no dissapointment
3,Wrong CD,"I was really excited for the rush of childhood memories when I got this package, but the wrong CD was in the case. I still knew and loved most of the songs on the one I got, and it was still a Radio Aahs CD, but it was not for the right month"
4,"Very good, but","This dictionary is a ""must have"" for anyone working with Albanian; it is a work by which all others will be judged.I'd give it 4.5 stars if I could.My big problem: the normal citation form for Albanian verbs is the first person singular indicative. Newmark uses the third person singular indicative. This complicates matters for the novice. Wish he hadn't done that.This has nothing to do with the quality of the dictionary -- but in this paperback edition the type size is small -- so small, in fact, that a colleague could not use it at all."
5,Prog Classic,"This classic recording is available from the band at a reasonable price. Google the band's name and go to their website. Prices are in Swedish Krona which can be converted to local currency on XE.com. Don't pay inflated prices, buy directly from the artist."
3,"Didn't realize they were so small, I missed the word mini","I haven't used these yet, though I didn't realize they were ""mini"". They are cute."
2,POOR BATTERY POWER AND CHEAP CONSTRUCTION,"I received this drill as a requested Christmas gift in 2003. After a full year of trying to work with it I have retired my Skil 2887-06 because I never got more than two hours out of a fully charged battery (even drilling in soft wood) and the Torque - Speed setting slipped from one to the other under certain circumstances. I found the drill to be excessively heavy and much too BIG for too many jobs. I like the Skil name but this drill was a disaster for me. I don't know which cordless will replace the Skil 2887-06 but I have freed myself of it and am currently using a 25 year old 3/8"" Skil."
1,Amazon.com's delayed my shipment four times,"Amazon.com has delayed my shipment four times for this product. I am anxious to get it as it has good reviews, but we're onto about 6 weeks of delays now. I could have already received it had I purchased it at Lowe's or Home Depot.Good drill, but POOR Amazon.com service on this one. I won't ever order tools via Amazon.com again. Amazon.com just can't cut it here."
2,Way over priced!,Way over priced for what you get. This should sell for $19.95 at the most! BPS and CABELAS have tube kits that blow this one away except that they don't have the 6 swivel hooks. Impulse purchases often disappoint after the fact!
2,Cute,"I bought four, hoping for spatulas/turners that would work in my few pieces of stick free cookware. These really are spatulas to use in bowls of batter or jars of mayonnaise and do not have the strength to turn over a piece of meat or comfortably stir fry vegetables. I was disappointed, but I also misunderstood what I was purchasing. I may tie bows on them and give them as stocking gifts at Christmas because they are cute."
3,Didn't like it,The face and the head are nice and that is why I gave it a 3 star. The part that I didn't care for was quality of the legs and boots. The legs are made out of parachute material and the boots were a cheap plastic. I found it hard to bend the legs to where it would standup by itself. I found by turning it upside down that it was easier to move and work with the legs. Also where the boots and the legs come together it's not held together very well. If the legs and boots were better I would have given it a better review. If you are looking for the battery compartment it's found in the hat.
3,"Good, but there is better...","I enjoyed Jokes from the Internet by Fred Ward, but I have just read better. McFool's Internet Humor has an incomparable collection of Internet jokes and stories. Ward's book is good, but McFool's is better."
2,Dissapointed,"I have made many purchases on Amazon for my kids and this has been the first one that I have felt compelled to write a review on. The swing sounded great on the site but when I got it I was really dissapointed. There is not one word of instruction on the best way to hang it. The rope ends have two different kinds of fixtures on them like it should be done a certain way. The swing sits too far upright for little ones, even though it is advertised as being good for ages 0-1. The seat belt is really flimsy and is just a cheap strap without a clasp that slides under their armpits. I recommed that you check out some other infant swings before spending your money on this one."
3,Found instructions on how to install,"The swings we received do not look like the one pictured. It is a light lime green, and so doesn't match the rest of our playset. Also the swings came with no instructions and I was baffled at first on how to install.The swings we received have a label JoyBay by Glopo on the back, not Gorilla, however I was able to find instructions here: [...]"
1,Very Disappointed,"This swing was a huge disappointment. It came in a box with no instructions. The swing has two different rings on the hanging ends that we were never able to figure out what to do with them and how it was supposed to be hung. We ended up buying hardware to hang it through the rope loops bypassing the confusing rings. Once we finally had the swing up we realized that no matter what we did it leaned forward. After paying $20 for the swing, $20 for shipping and $11 on hanging hardware we are junking the swing adn looking for a new one that is better made. Dont waste your money on this trash."
2,Meh.,"I got this swing free because I had a coupon & purchased a whole swing set from a local company. The Yellow bar is extremely difficult to get it to open & close - especially when your little one is in it. THe seat belt is crappy too. It swings very upright, and I dislike this swing so much that I'm actually going to purchase another one."
5,Really works!!,The Bush Flower Essences really work!! I have been using this for about four days now and I have already noticed a subtle yet strong change in my Confidence! Wonderful product. I highly recommend!
4,Funny read but,"it seems like the editing was a bit rushed. Not that this takes away from the story or the humour, but it can be annoying such as on page 108, when Sandi's name changes spelling. Okay, that's nit-picking, but the err is a wee more egregious when Ralph's Malibu (which is talked about through a good portion of the book) mysteriously turns into a truck in chapter eleven.Again; none of that should dismiss the book which, though sometimes the descriptive phrases can get a little tired and the slow the action, is funny and enjoyable. I read it in two shifts at work (security).Another job medium rare, Mr. Nelson!"
2,Highly dissapointed,"I really wanted to like this book but halfway through I was forcing myself to keep reading. The only reason I'm giving this 2 stars is the writing, I was drawn to caring for Ponty from the first chapter which made the first half of the book readable. However, the plot was weak and somewhat predictable. The characterizations of the two Minnesota celebrities was over the top and slightly annoying. I expected something along the lines of Christopher Moore but instead got a completely unengaging collection of dry humor. I'm a big fan of Mike Nelson's work on MST3K which is why it saddens me to write this review but I regret buying this and I regret the time spent reading it."
2,Can't get into it.,"And I'm a fan of his short stories and MST3k - but this -I""ve tried to crack this thing for years. It is SO unengaging. So flat. Cannot reccommend it. Sorry Mike!!"
4,If Hiaasen were Minnesotan and liked umlauts,"Anyone who likes Carl Hiaasen should like Mike Nelson's Death Rat. Instead of Hiaasen's south Florida, Mike Nelson pokes fun at the icons of Minnesota which, of course, are the only three Minnesota icons that one can think of: Prince, Garrison Keillor, and Jesse Ventura. Throw in a little Fargo and some Danish humor and you got Death Rat. (I didn't even know there was such thing as Danish humor: apparently it involves strange and bland food, words with umlauts, and naked men getting drunk in saunas).As with any good farce, the plot is secondary to Nelson's stream of comedic riffs. Just like the wedgies that are the protagonist's greatest weapon: Death Rat is good clean fun."

4,"Great game play, lousy card deck","The play of the game itself is great -- similar to Scattergories in that you'll be coming up with words that fit a certain category and are looking for them to start with certain letters of the alphabet, but with several twists that make it even more entertaining.The one beef I really had with this game is that the deck of available categories is too small -- in just two or three games you'll begin to repeat categories. So, you may wish to augment the deck with categories of your own."
4,It's Venice!,"It's always a bit off-putting to hear our Italian heroes speaking German but one can get used to it. After all, it's still Venice and the characters are simpatici!"
4,Great Idiom Book For Kids,"This is a great idiom book for children, and you will have a lot of fun teaching yours the idioms enclosed. The illustrations are fabulous, and the idioms are fun. This book definitely would have gotten four stars if it were longer than 29 pages. That being said, these are high-quality idioms and high-quality illustrations from a high-quality author. Ms. Snodgrass does an amazing job in this genre.Enjoy!Todd HagopianPresident/CEOHagopian InstituteAuthor of the popular ""Quote Junkie"" book sereies and the brand new ""Idiom Junkie"" series"
5,"Fantastic guide to idioms. Great for any kid, but especially helpful for those with ASD.",This is a fun guide to helping kids understand all those crazy sayings that most of us just naturally understand through experience...highly recommended!
5,MADE IN GERMANY!!! OUTSTANDING QUALITY!!!,"Buy it for your toddler! You wont be dissapointed! I can assure you if you didnt buy Selecta toys before you didnt know what the true quality is. All those wooden toys coming from China have nothing to do with quality and safety for your little one. The second I opened the box - I was amazed. You can see and feel that this is a high shelf product. Selecta uses maple wood for its toys and special thermo-printing techinque, topped with a finish of natural beeswax. Their toys are not only safe, beautiful but also fun, educational and will last forever :) Yes, I am in love with Selecta toys :) Unfortunately it is not easy to find them in USA anymore..."
1,"Only funny in the ""this is really bad"" type of funny","I have started amassing a kung-fu library of my own, and while I appriciated some of the early bruce lee stuff, i didn't see why everyone loved it so fast. Then I got this DVD. If this was the competition, Bruce Lee must have won every award in the known world. This set of movies is more funny due to its poor job than purely entertaining. Eagle Claw champion is not as funny in this way, but Cobra vs. Ninja is simply awesome. I close with the best three words of the movie ""ninja challenge card."""
5,Rocks The She Zit,"Jenny Choi becomes ""Sanawon"", with this, her 4th record. This album is more polished and more dead on than her previous efforts. You can really tell where she wants to take her sound. From beginning to ""the end"" you will find yourself humming these tunes. Definitely worth the purchase. Give it a try. You might like it."
1,HORRIBLE experience/product,"Bad overall product:expensive and poor quality: cheap quality wood came damaged, screws went through the wood (really dangerous for kids). Cheap screws that broke. Made in China, poor, poor quality. When I addressed my problems to the customer service, they could not care less. They ask me to send it back, although I mentioned the screws went through the wood, they would not pay for shipment and hang up on me. Run away from these people, They are horrible and very questionable. I had to call the Better Business Bureau in order for to investigate this company. When it comes to children companies like this one should be investigated. They do not care about our kid's health, they only care about money. Give yourself a favor, avoid them."
4,Solid with one little issue,"This router works very well, plenty of power. The only issue is that once you set the depth and start a route, the bit will lower about 1/16"". So I just keep a piece of scrap around to test the route depth before I start my work. I have never had a problem doing it this way."
3,Atlantic speaker mounts,"Mounts are fine for the price. Had to play with them a bit to fit the Energy Classic speakers. Also, one of the speakers mounts loosens on its own allowing the speaker to twist when mounted on the wall. Had to put a piece of thin rubber in the ball/socket area so the ball doesn't twist. All in all, for the price they are fine."
4,Worked well for me,"There where a lot of mixed reviews on these speaker mounts but or the price I think they work well. My speakers were light LG surround speakers so they handled the weight real well. The LG speaker only has one threaded insert for mounts so I could only use one hole for mounting. Not a huge problem, but not the best as well. The speaker kit should come with an adapter for this. I also wish they kept the speaker closer to the wall, with this mount they are about 3-4"" away from the wall Overall they worked well for me."
3,"Ok product, does not work for small speakers","I bought these mounts because I read they would work with small speakers, in particular, Energy Take Classic 5.1 speakers. They are are reasonably well made product. They do not stay in position no matter how much you tighten the moving ball joint piece even with speakers that weigh 3-5 pounds. I would consider spending the money on something better."
3,"Cheap, and well cheap... that about says it.","I was looking for some cheap speaker mounts for my ""man cave"" and these fit the bill. Quality wasn't terrible but wasn't great either. The speakers ""sag"" a little for example... But they did the trick and they were cheap."
1,Atlantic mounts,Not bad for light speakers. My Cambridge Soundworks 155 at 8 pounds or so are to heavy. The ball rotates on the rod that is embeded in it. It happened on all five mounts. To bad the rest is pretty good. 24 bucks in the trash for me.
4,cost effective,Was in the market for a cheap decent set of speaker mounts. Found exactly what i was looking for here. Just pay close attention on the weight of your speakers.
1,Doesn't work with Energy Take Classic 5.1,"I bought this for my new Energy Take Classic 5.1 speakers. I tried every possible way but it doesn't fit at all. As a last option, I have removed the speaker's key hole mount, have put the atlantic mount through the speaker's threaded insert after much difficulty and it will be slightly angled as it hits speaker's wire connector box. May be we need to cut out a portion of the mount to get a perfect flat fit !Very dissappointed !!!"
3,Adequate For Small Speakers,"It's made of plastic and worked with my Polk Audio 6750 5.1 HT speakers. I wouldn't hang heavy speakers (over 5 lbs) with these and the adjustment ring needs to be really tight to hold the speakers. The plastic anchors that came with it didn't work, so I used metal ones that screw into the wall. It's a fair deal for the price."
2,Just okay,I was not really impressed with the quality of these mounts. I would have liked a better quality of plastic.
4,They work for ProCinema 60,"These mounts will support the Definitive ProCinema 60 speakers using the 1/4 20 mounting hole in the back. As other reviews stated, the hardware provided is cheap. I used my own screws and put them direct into the studs.You need to tighten the mount if it droops. I just kept rotating the speaker until it was in the position I wanted and it was on there tight. I was careful not to force them too far."
3,Atlantic 77335068,"Used 3 of the 5 for the front speakers, was hoping they would tighten down better on some small Sony speakers, works though. When I upgrade to Polks will probably need to use the Polk mounting system instead as these are probably not going to cut it. Works for the time being."
4,Pretty Good,"I thought it worked as advertised. The price was excellent. I have an Energy Micro surround set and the screws were too large to fit in the keyhole for the speakers. After a modification it worked fine and does not looked rigged. I think for a few cents more they could have provided 2-3 screw size options to resolve this issue. The profile is nice and not too bulky or large. The arm that extends from the base is not that long therefore this would not be a unit suitable for mounting from a ceiling, wall only."
3,"Practical, not special.","I bought these twice, but wound up only using the center channel speaker holders. My decision was based solely on aesthetics. I can't see the bracket behind my center speaker. The R/L front and satellite speakers weren't that easy to mount to these brackets and left the hardware, not that sightly, exposed to view. They work, but just not the way I'd like to see them."
4,Pretty Good,"These are basic and simple to use. My only wish is that they could articulate more, providing more options for mounting and directing the speakers. Other than that, they are a good option for setting up a home theatre."
1,Junk Drill ever seen,"I am very disappointed with my Bleck&Decker; drill. it broke in the first week of use, I thought I was buying a tool, not a toy.I've heard there is no replacement parts available for fixing that kind of junk.I supposed drills should be approved in performance tests, before to go to the stores.I do not recommend it for any who consider quality as a basic feature.Decided: I will never buy any product from B&D;."
1,Don't Even Think About It!!,I can't believe I paid almost $80 for this piece of junk. It broke almost instantly. I took it apart...the drive gears are unbelievably undersized and some teeth were broken. My advice...buy anything else!
1,Stay away from this drill,"I used just three time before it had broken and with really esay tasks. First time I used as a ""HardUse Hammer drill"" it turns off until today. Less than 3 months of use for your money is really expensive"
5,for homeowner only,"Best electric drill I had for my home projects. Does the little jobs you want it to do without any problems. I did not use it on heavy duty work, because it is clearly not made for this kind of work that other users described in there review. If you buy a low cost drill you cannot expect it to do the work of high priced professional equipment! I like it and recommend it highly to homeowners."
1,Cheap POS,I can believe they house a motor that gets hot in plastic that melts than allows the motor to shift position and now I cant seem to change direction. Don't waste your money or time with this product.
1,Drilled only four holes then it broke.,This drill is junk! Zero stars! Drilled four holes then the thing rattled and wouldn't rotate. I had a similar $29 Harbor Freight drill that was better. It only lasted one year. So I bought the B&D thinking at $50 it had to be at least as good...but it was worse. I usually can fix just about anything so I took the gear case apart to see what was wrong. The gears just don't line up. I then tried shimming the gear shaft to get the gears lined up but the internal drive is a sloppy mess. The problem is with the hammer/drill feature. Internally it shifts the gear position for each mode but instead it basically disconnects the motor from the chuck after a little use. Also there was almost no grease in the gear case. But grease won't fix the problem...bad design! The B&D drill is now in the landfill and a new RIDGID drill is in the garage and it cost only a little more than these two junk drills combined.
4,Over Charged for Used Product,"The two used CD'd were in good condition.The problem is that the original order was for two new CD's, and that is what I have been charged.I agreed to accept the used CD's at the ""used CD"" price.I need a refund for the difference between the new CD and used CD price.Regards,Roger Nowack"
4,Perfect for everyone!,"I would recomend this product for anyone, I bought this for my husband and was amazed that I fell in love with it. It is lightweight and easy to use. He uses it for building shelves and I use it for things like Christmas ornaments."
2,"Lots of pages, few recommendations","The comments of the last reviewer really says it all. I bought this book expecting to get some good tips on locking down my NT environment. Instead the book is mostly theory. Not a complete waste, but not as useful as I hoped."
2,Joint Therapy tablets for dogs,Lable was faded. Could not read expiration date. Tablets seemed old and crumbled much easier then the exact same one I bought from Petsmart before.
2,another movie,"we were not satisfied with this movie...found it boring and nothing one can realate to...we were suprised because we do like Tyne Daly as an actress, and this is just not her......"
5,Purrty,"I am a Texas housewife - this CehDeh is very purrty - it makes my ears happy.-Betty R. RuthledgeAmarillo, TX"
1,I agree with JohnT,What is this? It cannot be called music. Why can't people just write a good tune anymore? Disappointing to say the least!
3,wrong price,"the 180 price tag might be wrong by amazon, I bought 1 @ lowes for 34 plus change, caveat emptor!"
1,Wimpy and torquey all at the same time......,"Wimpy and torquey all at the same time......It has a alot of torque to do most average drilling jobs....Just don't use it for anything or it might break......I dropped mine from a foot off the ground...The back split wide open.....So I bought another identical drill......Within 6 months of use, the bit shaft warped and now the drill looks like a bent axle when driving screws......This makes it somewhat difficult to drive drywall screws. Hmmmmm....so yeah, it's a great drill as long as ya adon't use it..........."
3,Not quite there,"I looked forward to seeing this movie for some time. And, maybe I built it up in my mind a little too much. But, I was somewhat disappointed. It was not a bad movie, but not as good as I had hoped. It just seems to keep approaching greatness and meaning, but never quite getting there, leaving much too soon or not confronting those issues head-on. Be that as it may, I still liked it, but then I would probably watch anything with Sabrina Lloyd. She rates very high in the cuteness category. I guess my crush on her affected my opinion of the main character, played lethargically by John Livington. How could he not love her? Who cares about the actual scientific chemistry of love? What kind of warped mind examines love in that context? Or on the other hand, what does she see in him? All questions that are hard to answer. Nonetheless, though disappointed I still feel that the movie is worth viewing and would probably check out other films by the director Mark Decena."
5,great movie!,This is an awesome movie! An interesting look at whether love is physical or chemical within the human species and what exactly seperates us from animals. Inspired quite a discussion between my girlfriend and I.
1,Requiem much?,"This film artistically is a complete rip off of Requiem for a Dream. Many recent films have tried and failed by mostly focusing on the drug aspects (Spun), so you'd think one that focuses little on the drugs and mostly on the relationships would be able to have some sort of success...wrong. The wanna-be Clint Mansell soundtrack and time lapse cinemetography a la Darren Aranofsky should only be copywrited and only used in their respective films. Anyone else who makes such a blatant attempt always fails, this being no exception. I thought Sundance for for innovation? They certainly let this one slip through the cracks."
3,Look how large it is,"After owning multiple sets of glassware in the past 25 years, my husband & I stopped buying wineglasses because they kept getting broken. I figured at this price, let's try again. I ordered them & they came quickly. What I didn't realize is how large they are. Maybe they are dishwasher safe, but they don't fit in my 7 year old maytag!They are fine to use & good quality, but large. Buyers beware."
3,"Easy read, but a bit too simplistic","I was able to complete this book in two evenings, and it does serve as a good introduction to UML and object oriented programming. I just wish it went a little deeper, and I found some of the authors design choices suspect to say the least. I just didn't get how a video (one of the classes explored) could search for other videos. This should be a function of a container class (video_collection or something), yet the authors treated the video class as an instance of a video and a collection at the same time. If you're looking to get started learning OOP and UML, this is a decent start, but just don't expect much more than the basics."
3,Good for beginners...,"...but not very acedemic. I was suprised this was a required book for a Masters Level course.However, it is easy to read and understand, and a few years ago I could have used it."
4,The Thorns are already visible and so are the flower buds!,"I was curious about this plant when I saw it & because I love exotic plants and I consider this to be exotic, I ordered it. It arrived 2/19/11 instead if the promised 2/28/11. I already have it in a larger pot. I couldn't believe my eyes when I noticed the little thorns and then I saw the little flower buds already there. I am very, very pleased. It arrived along with all the other plants I ordered and looks quite healthy. When I got the Crown it came in a pot so small I didn't even know how it could have been put in such a mini-pot. It came with buds, loves its larger pot and is getting ready to flower which are opening up as we speak. HOW BIG DOES IT GET?Thanks Hirts & Amazon.com.LDSBets"
5,Surprised..,"I've never bought a *live* plant before and wow, Im surprised it came alive! its not dead.. and its not dying.. just gorgeous! thanks so much! Quick shipping aswell.. definitely would recommend to anyone looking for a crown of thorns plant.."
2,crown of thorns,"recieved all 5 packed in a small box , planted that day ,so far i have 3 left, 2 died next day [looked bad out of box]"
5,A must for storytellers,"This is a gem of a book with collections of tales, many of whom have never been written down before. This is a real treasure for anyone interested in Asian folklore. It's especially useful for storytellers as apart from the stories, extra information about the country is included. Kudos to the author and editor for making this available in English for more to enjoy and appreciate the richness of indonesia through its tales."
3,Pedestrian Starter for Edwards,"Harry Devlin is an attorney who married a beautiful woman with a mischievous and magnetic personality. He can't quit her, even though she left him for a few other men with zero regard for his feelings. When she's murdered, Devlin is possessed by the desire to find her killer.Devlin's quest for justice seems a little unbelievable. She was a horrible person who deeply wounded her husband with her infidelities, and I found it hard to believe he ""could not rest until he found the killer!"" The writing style is O.K., but there are too many forced similes that grate on the reader after a few chapters. Ending a chapter with a ""mysterious"" question is also a thriller no-no--""Could it be that our hero was wrong in his suspicion of Bob as the killer?!"" Kind of corny.The criminal would have been quite easy to identify, for both the police and Devlin, if Edwards would not have withheld obvious relationships among the suspects. Martin has promise, but this is not a first-rate novel."
1,It broke. I won't miss it.,"I've never had this happen before in any tool. One of the winding pickups on the armature broke off. When I opened up the motor, the pickup was loose in the case. One of the brushes had gotten jammed into the armature.Other than that, I found it to be an okay router. Plenty of power, but weight \ balance wise it was hard to use it smoothly. So I left it permanently mounted in my router table, and bought a Hitachi router for hand use. I am much happier using the Hitachi free hand than I was with the Skil. I won't miss this one."
4,Really cool and dreamy,"I like this album a lot though I realize I don't listen to it frequently. When I do I'm always happy I did. It makes me think of dreaming, and reading fairy tales, and fuzzy photographs, and garden paths in rain. Well ... it takes you to a delightful place, I think, which is what music is about."
4,Some of the major plays are in this!,"Like Volume I Content page, Indexing and paging could be better,but all that is m\necessary is really still here.These are some of the major plays of Shakespeare:TAMING OF THE SHREW, THE MERCHANT OF VENICE, ROMEO AND JULIETMidsummer and Much Ado are both much played comedies as well.I got this for John and Richard II which were historiesnot seen that often played as Henry V and Richard III.Boy, the English history plays are bloody andfull of murder of innocentsfor title and power alone.Poor King or monster if your name is Richardand you are English?Henry, Edward and Richard were brothers, fathers, sons and cousinswho ate each other upuntil they were no more.The middle English prejudice against Jews is setdown in the Merchant."
2,Another ghost written Johnston--sub-par,"this is another of those 'counterfeit' Johnstones, written after he died--low quality, poor writer, fake name as coauthor--a counterfeit spin off of series written by some hack writer hired by estate to pump out more books and maximum revenue stream after he died. halfway readable but you sure don't want to save it and it is worth what it sells for in used bookshopes, maybe a half buck for a quick read if you don't get fed up with it and put it down to gather dust."
5,Great book about serving in the British Army,"William ""Penny"" Pennington was a boy trumpeter in the British army during the 30's, then went on to become a Forward Artillery Observer (FAO) in the Burma Campaign at the close of World War II. Those are the bare facts.But the fun is in the details. He tells what it was like to join up, train, be shipped to another part of the world, and to serve the British Crown as a young soldier in India-- the ""RAJ"" as it was called. Frankly, the book is simply outstanding. One of the best books in my library, and I've referred it to many other people, all of whom have come back with enthusiastic reviews as well.I love to read books by ordinary people who lived in world-changing times. This one fits the bill, and then some.Get it. Read it. Pass it on."
1,A waste of time,"Without exaggeration, one of the most inept, mediocre novels I've ever read. If you were just given the manuscript without knowing that it was a published novel, you would think that it was a first draft, written by a high school student. The prose is flat, the characters unsympathetic, the metaphors obvious, there's not one genuine, natural moment in the entire story, and the attempts at poetic imagery reek of a stylist obtuse enough not to realize how utterly bland and uninspired his work is. This author's a tourist. If you cherish your time as much as I do, don't waste it on this."
1,Terrible pretentious arrogant,"It's been said better elsewhere. Why spend time with unlikeable and unsympathetic characters. The writing is boring...tedious, overly explanatory. I don't like being ""told"" by the narrator what each person is about and what each event signifies...I like making my own conclusions."
4,Bohemia Redux,"Once again, Nersesian proves that he is the master of the bohemian/downtown NYC novel. Although not as lively as his other novels, particularly The F**k-up or Dogrun, this is nevertheless an engaging, realistic portrait of living the harrowing 'art life' in the Big City. Entertaining and darkly funny, I recommend it. Also recommended: The Losers' Club by Richard Perez"
3,pretty good!,"this wasn't as bad as i thought. i do install car stereos' professionally, and realy this is all you need. but its realy only good for something like, one 300 watt 12 inch sub woofer, and a 600 watt amp.if your constantly bumping your system, then youll need a bigger gauge wire set. or else you'll risk blowing stuff. like your amp.Overall, i give this a 7"
4,A great drill with a great price!,My husband wanted a drill and I found this on Amazon. It had a better price than buying it at any big box store and the shipping was free!
3,Valuable. Only a few criticisms.,"This atlas serves a real need for any serious student of North American history. The alternative is to chase down many sources that have individualized map information for individual explorers.In some cases, however, the colors are difficult to actually discern. There is so many route information, with so many colors that are similar, that it is difficult to distinguish one route from another.Also, a stated map scale of both miles and kilometers for each map would be helpful.Otherwise great! -- in my opinion.Why is the atlas no longer in print, at least at present?Are the authors planning a revised copy?I'd like the authors to know about this, and receive a big pat on the back from this old history student and high school history teacher.Les Falk, Kelowna, BC, Canada"
5,Perfect and quality,"Pay attention to sizeing charts, do not be affraid to trust them even though they seem a bit off. I am a 36 waist and had to browse some similat product sizing charts before I decided on the Large. It is just right as a windproof overpant. It also has a thermal lining for extra warmth. Sometimes I'll use it over my silk thermals so as not to overheat. But I'm we're going to dine at a lodge, I'll have jeans under and take off teh overpants when inside."
1,Don't make my mistake.,"I bought this saw as a compromise between the Makita level saws and the ten dollar junk. I should have spent the extra money and bought a Dewalt, Makita or Hitachi. The power level is ok, but cutting a straight line is a roll of the dice. Even when I use a speed square as a straight edge I get cuts that are not 90 degrees. The other problem is that the base plate will not stay perpendicular to the blade and the wheel to tighten it is in a terrible location and hard to use.This is without a doubt the worst powertool I have ever bought and I will be replacing it in the next month."
2,decent for occasional use,"I bought the jig saw to replace an older B&D jig saw I had before. While it is way better than my old one, it is still a mediocre tool. My worst complaint is the footplate locking knob. It is extremely hard to tighten, and no matter how much I tightened, the base plate can still easily moved, making it very hard to make perfect straight up and down cuts. The vacuum attatchement is also worthless and so is the dust blower. If you need a jig saw that will only get used a few times a year, this is a good buy. If you want something that will cut easliy, stay in alignment, stand up to heavy duty use, and produce great quality cuts do what I did and buy a Bosch."
3,Decent first jig saw,"This jig saw is large and tough. It has withstood a lot of use and abuse. The heavy plastic case has been tough enough to withstand a few short drops to the floor. It isn't the easiest to control, but it is a good hobby saw. The power cord is a little short. Overall I would say it is a good value, but it is an ""entry"" level power tool for the occasional user."
