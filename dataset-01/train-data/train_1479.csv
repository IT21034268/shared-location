2,Okay,"This album is a disappointment after seeing this awesome performer live. The feelings, the emotions and the moods are not transfered onto the CD. The CD has some brilliant singles on it like ""Made it Back"" and ""Rewind."" The other songs are just below average."
4,blue discus,The weight and feel of the discus was good. The overall structure of the product was good. the price was set correctly for the product
5,Polluted promises,Great book and great product. Needed this book for one of my college courses. Definitely an interesting book. I would recommend reading it.
5,2nd season's better,"for the Loonatics as they run across just about every villian in the Looney Tunes universe from future relatives of Elmer Fudd, Sylvester, Yosemite Sam to name a few. Also playing a prominent role in the 2nd season is Tweetums (relative of Tweety). He plays the ruler of a far away planet called Blanc that has a lot more relevance for this season as we draw closer to the end.It is fun to watch seeing all the characters and their various powers working together even that ego filled Danger Duck (its pretty obvious its still about him). But he still does what he does to help the team out. We also run across a villian or two from Season 1 that i'll leave up to you find out who that person is. They also play a prominent role in the season ender (2 parts). Excellent stories, action and fun to be had by people of all ages."
4,A Great Kids Show,"This cartoon series is a fun mixs of the looney Tunes like Bugs Bunny, Daffy Duck, Road Runner, Whil E. Coyote, and the Tasmanian Devil with superpowered heroes. It's probably not good for those younger then three or four but I'd say the target audience was closer to five through ten or eleven years of age. The humor is not that complicated to get but is there to help keep the show lighthearted while theses superpowered Loonatics save the city of Acmetropolis. While not necessarily high brow entertainment it would make good fun for younger kids."
4,A fine hard-core album,"I'll be straight forward: this is a great album--much better than ""Pro-Pain""(this is still good)-but still not as good as ""The Truth Hurts"". ""Truth"" is an excellent album. Nevertheless, ""Act of God"" is far better than any current radio offering or so-called heavy metal that is out on the shelves these days."
2,Defective with little support,"Got the hard drive in the mail, plugged it in and while my computer recognized a USB device attaching, it was unable to properly recognize the hard drive. After 2 wasted hours trying to get it to work, I realized I was simply unlucky enough to get a defective drive. During those 2 hours I discovered:- Cavalry's US support site is basically a form to fill out and 40 unanswered user-submitted questions- Cavalry's ""support"" CD is a labyrinth of EVERY driver Cavalry makes, all stored in cryptically named folders.- The small amount of included documentation is in terribly broken english and Chinese characters.I threw it back in its box and returned it, and bought a wonderful Lacie drive the same night from a local store (I needed something immediately.You can get better quality and support from other products at the same price range."
2,So-so print quality,The print was very difficult to read. It looked like a photocopy of a photocopy. Pages 101 to the end of the book were extrememly difficult to read and the text was offset. There was no margin at the botttom and almost 3 inches at the top.
2,Not for medium or long styles,"I was looking to try something different than my normal pomade, so I was recommended this product instead. My hair is medium in length and I wear it a bit spiky in the front and top.That being said, this stuff is useless for my hair. It doesn't hold at all like a pomade does, and it makes your hair very shiny. Lastly, it smells like coconut for a while after putting it in - for better or for worse.Short hair - yes.Medium to long hair - no hold at all."
3,iSight may have problems with Leopard 10.5.1,"While using the iSight external firewire webcam on my Mac G5 tower with Panther 10.3.9 system software installed, I found it to have excellent video quality and to be very easy to use. Shortly after installing Leopard 10.5.1 however, the fun was over. My cam stopped working and no amount of tech fixes have brought it back. It now shows up as ""unknown device"" in the system profiler, and is not recognized in Yahoo or any other program I've tried.If you search the internet you'll find numerous suggestions as varied as the circumstances that can create the problem. Apparently some fixes work in certain situations, some don't, some work some of the time, etc...The iSight is an excellent cam, but if you'll be using it on a Mac that's running Leopard, proceed with extreme caution."
3,limited use,"my dad bought me an isight about a year ago, and i love it! however, while it works great, it only works with macs, and since most people seem to have pcs, i can only use it with 2 or 3 of my friends and family, not what i was hoping for!"
4,The Ladybug Blues,"This is an adorably-illustrated book that children will adore, HOWEVER I am so thankful that I previewed it BEFORE reading it to my daughter. In the story, the ladybug is lost and is told by other creatures that he ""doesn't look like"" them, so he doesn't belong, isn't part of their family. This is not the message I want to send to my internationally-adopted daughter!!!"
5,A must have!!!,"I have been a children's book enthusiast for many years. This is a must have for any child. Beautifully written and illustrated. I always give a childrens book, along with my gift, in lieu of a card. I personally sign it with (exp.) ""Baby's name ~May You Love To Read ~Auntie Deb"" It's always a big hit! This book was no exception."
4,"Dan Swano's side project ""Nightingale""","Nightingale is Dan Swano singing in totaly clean vocals with a contemporary 80's type of sound. The first song ""Nightfall Overture"" is a killer track with some of the best guitar lines I have heard in a while. I suggest buying this cd only if you are into the the 80's sounds (especially since the drumming is done all by machines). Overall ""The Breathing Shadow"" is a good cd but it could have been a little better. Check out Dan Swano's new cd ""MOONTOWER"" one of his best cd's yet! Also look for the new Nightingale cd ""I"" hopefuly comming out sometime within in 1999."
2,A Cult Classic.. and not much else! Every RPGer must see it!,"Bad acting, a terrible plot, and reality stretched to the brink make this movie a terrible choice for anyone that DOES NOT play roleplaying games. If you do like RPGs, rent this movie with your friends and watch it - you'll laugh yourselves silly, especially at the ending!"
4,MAZES AND MONSTERS...A GOOFBALL CLASSIC,"MAZES AND MONSTERS....hmmm....wait a minute...i play D&D and i think that title would make for a good adventure! but seriously..the movie was full of bull as well as unintentional laughs(PARDU the holy man...HAHA! )this fine piece of trash makes for good camp.Also,check out the book written by RONA JAFFE on which this movie is based and you'll also have some good summer reading!"
2,Don't let the cover fool you,"I saw the movie off of the Mystery Channel. I was boring. For those of you expecting the 'heroes' to get zapped into a fantasy land, forget it. Tom Hanks thinks he's in the magical world. This movie is helped only by likable kids. Skip it and watch Labyrinth or Willow instead."
3,Mazes and Monsters,"Though it's a low-budget TV movie, Mazes and Monsters exposed us to Tom Hanks showing that he could play a serious role early on. It took nearly ten years for another serious role to come around and he won an Oscar for it. Most of the reviewers say this film discriminates against role-playing gamers. I think the main character was desperate for something to believe in other than his real-life and then became fanatical about something to the point of a pyschotic episode. He could have done this with anything, not just RPGs. He could have been like most people and did it with religion."
2,Ughh,"I can't believe I wasted 105 minutes of my life watching it. I was expecting a Labrynth-esque type show based on reading the cover. Instead it was a ""lesson"" on the evils or RPG."
4,Mazes and Monsters,"I saw this movie only once, way back in 1984, but still remember some of the scenes vividly, especially the final scene with Tom Hanks. ""RPG"" was not part of my vocabulary then, but the movie sure left a lasting impression."
3,"Not big on quality, but very entertaining in a campy way.","The year : 1982. The fad: big hair. These 2 facts are brought into a painfully clear reality in the film ""Mazes and Monsters"". A young Tom Hanks, starting off in a burgeoning film career with a Toronto based movie about a kid who goes nuts from playing a role playing game. Who would have thoght he'd ever win an Oscar, never mind 2 of them! In his hoe down plaid shirts and his emotional cracking voice in phone conversations, this is not one of his best works. But, taking all of that into account, and checking one's brain in at the door before viewing, this film is actually pretty entertaining, in a laughable, campy way and it also stars Chris Makepeace, who doesn't do too bad of a job being mediocre. He's better than the other two stooges who call themselves actors."
2,Not very accuret,I remember wathching this movie many years ago the person who wrote the script was clearly trying to say Dungeon& Dragons is a very dangerous game. It is not. Their are no risks in playing the game if your not a nut case. I played D&Dfor about seven years and im perfectly fine and so are the people I played with. A person can turn anything into an instumont of evil and also take things to the extrem. As far as the acting in the movie is it medocre besides Tom Hanks which even he didnt do so well.
5,Old Myth meets Re-animation:,"""Out of Avalon"" Is a fantastic anthology put together by a mindspring of artists/authors whom have all been inspired by the Authorian Legends of old. Tales ranging with Artur being portrayed as the cruel king, and Myrddin as a light hearted creature afraid of being chained. These various shorts happily visit many, often unexplored, avenues of these fascinating spins. A must for the Mythology follower, or just plain young at heart. This pleasing book will most definately give one a refreshing new persepctive and reinstall a sense of magic to the soul and imagination."
2,*Yawn*,"I adore the Avalon series, but this book, quite frankly, sucked. While it was not anywhere near as horrible as ""Ancestors of Avalon"", it was still bad. I wish people would learn that Bradley cannot be imitated. If you wish to write about Arthurian legend, be my guest. Stop trying to mimic Bradley though!If you want to read this novel, get it from your library. Don't waste your money on it."
5,Beautiful!,"It can be disappointing to receive an item which looks nice on the web but is disappointingwhen upacked. This one was not! This nightlight has a beautiful designed ""cover piece""---dolphin is subject---andlights up beautifully giving the area a warm glow. It's easy to turn on and off and so isvery practical. One problem: have to be careful attachingcover to light fixture. It has it's own small screws inserted which are easy to turn but I had to attach thecover over a pillow because I was afraid it might fall out of my hand. It didn't."
4,Great Read,"Some people have criticized the lack of photos or video equipment, but they had such equipment. One of the main points of the book is how the activity frustrated their efforts to capture it on film at every turn. They also had infrared nightvision equipment, which showed things the human eye didn't. This was also during the 90's, so the whole GPS chipping thing didn't have the availability it does now. The case was well known, as the ranch was closed to the public, and there was much speculation as to what was really going on there. And there are some photos. Just not in the book. The e-zine Sub Rosa published an article on the ranch, with some landscape photos, and they also included a photo of the mutilated and bloodless calf's body. All in all, along with Daimonic Reality, Mothman Prophecies and Passport to Magonia, one of my favorite paranormal books."
2,"""OK""","I got this book for my Dad, who listens to Art Bell and ""things that go bump in the night."" He said, ""It was ok."" That's good enough for me. I did read some portions of the book and I got the impression the author couldn't decide if he was writing a low-b pulp or a scientific exploration of his subject. Sadly, I think he was shooting for the latter."
2,Interesting at first,This book started out as a real page turner but I could not finish the last few chapters because I could not stay awake!!!
3,Interesting but could be better,"This book started out really strong with chilling accounts of the Gorman family's experiences on the ranch, but the remaining 2/3 of the book basically rehashed the first 1/3 of the book over & over in different ways. Maybe this is due to two authors writing different sections and not being totally in sync? I have much respect for George Knapp and enjoy listening to him on Coast to Coast AM - so this is in no way a bad reflection of him, as he is a highly respected investigative journalist and author.Some photos reprinted in the book or other media (maps, timelines, graphs, newspaper reprints, etc) would have been nice and would have added to the readers understanding of the events. Also, more coverage of the history of ""high strangeness"" in the region would have helped paint the pattern of events in the area before the Gorman's purchased their ranch."
5,Believe or Don't Believe Whatever,"Look, I don't believe or not believe. I just had a lot of fun reading it. I gave my copy to my nephews and it scared the liven crud out of them. We all had a good laugh. What I liked most about the book is that it didn't try to get you to accept what was written as gospel - it just told the stories of people I happened to find very reputable. The stories themselves were completely entertaining and a bit mind boggling. I would recommend it as a great read on vacation. If you are a scientist writing a dissertation on parallel universes and M theory read something else. I give it 5 stars. ENJOY!"
3,A UTAH PORTAL TO ????,"I read this book due to my living in Utah, and having friends from this same area that have said they had many unexplained insodents as well. Creepy to think what this family went through...I don't know if I would have lasted as long as they did...especially when the cattle were moved to or TRANSPORTED to different areas of the ranch...I liked it!"
5,This book is amazing,I had a hard time getting to sleep after reading this book. It was so interesting that I had a hard time putting it down despite the fact that it was probably scarier than most fiction books I have read! Worth the money and time to read. This book will make a great addition to your paranormal/UFO book collection.
5,EYE OPENING,"This book is great, it goes into what was happen on the skin walker ranch, it's paranormal active, the weirdiness, and goes to show that life is not how we know it and what is beyond what is going on at the ranch and in that area of Utah."
5,Hunt for the Skinwalker,"This is a scary book about the unexplained, if it is 25% true it is very scary for those of us on this planet. Very well written, hard not to be scary with what those people in the story actually saw and happened to them. It leaves you wondering what are we in this world and what are they? This is not for children as I will keep it from my grandchildern until they are out of high school."
5,SKINWALKER,Very interesting read...couldn't put it down and was sorry to see it end. Compelling and makes you ponder the existence of alternate dimensions and worm holes searching for an answer to the bizaar incidents occurring on the Ranch.
2,poor science,"I had expected a ""scientific examination"" of UFO in this book.No pictures, or even diagrams; a lot of ""you should of seen it!"" when the rancher is all alone...2 stars for entertainment value, not much else. Should be listed under sci-fi."
2,The book is a SkinWalker,"Where is the science?The chapters about the wolves are just not believable. No analysis, no science only setting up fear visions. No aware human is going to let a giant wolf walk up to them. We are the result of ancestors not standing still while large predators walked up to them... No ""six foot tall"" man would let an unknown predator walk unchallenged right up to them, then pet it... The ancients that did, have not passed their genetic material on.It goes no where from there. Except...to make up more fear.The book is a ""SkinWalker"". We westerners know it immediately. What a way to gather power and money!...prey on the innocent. The SkinWalker way."
3,Lifted Up Only to be Letdown,"First third of book a real page-turner as weird and downright creepy events on the Utah ranch are described in all their inexplicable. spine-tingling horror! This section is all a person could ask for, and deals with high strangeness.After going over events at the Utah ranch in detail, the theme begins to wander. Aimless chapter-chaff on Sasquatch, other ranches, 'retread' hypotheses you've heard a hundred times before, and other 'blah-blah-blah' boring stuff thrown in to make up a book-sized tale. Real, real boring after a while. Finally had to force myself to keep reading.All that said, the first part can't be beat for a good read!"
5,Still we seek the truth,"This book is fantastic however; it leaves the reader wondering what it is that the people have been encountering, where does it/they come from, what is or are the purpose(s) of their sojouns to earth? How deeply is man involved with them? What part is our govenrment playing in these visits or missions."
1,Poor to say the least,"Nothing scientific about it...poor, conjecture and as usual no evidence,,a lot of silly not worth while to buy, I like my money back"
3,my thoughts on book,"very good read , it does let you draw your on thoughts on subject . the bad part is i feel they could have told some history of the other owners and tryed to get more back ground"
1,Written as it should be...,An absolutely boring piece of fiction. I was barely able to muscle my way through the first three chapters.
3,Where's the proof?,"After reading this book and listening to the radio interviews with the writers, I can't help feeling that the whole thing is a made up story. For a ""scientific"" book, there is very little evidence in the form of pictures, reports, or disclosure. I have been unable to find any proof that NIDS ever existed."
4,New insights,I have read about ufos and related subjects for over 40 years and am finding that most authors rehash and repeat what they and others have written about previously but are unable to provide new insights.This book presents a view that opens the eyes of the reader to the unlimited possibilities of the world we live in. I highly recommend this book to seekers of the ultimate truth.
2,Interesting,"I am very interested in the posibility of UFOs and outer space life; but found this a bit far off, especially on the mutilated cattle and the ""big foot"" theories"
3,Nicole Kidman and the Ninjas,"This is a 1987 film also known as ""Watch the Shadows Dance"", featuring Nicole Kidman, Tom Jennings, and Vince Martin. The box says it is an edge-of-your-seat action thriller. I wouldn't go that far, but the cinematography is better than you have any right to expect, and the karate is OK. And Nicole is cute."
5,An excellent display of elk hunting at it's finest.,"Paul Brunner, Tom Moore, Mike Lapinski and others share with you the excitement and thrill of bugling bull elk. They hunt in different regions of the country so it is more familiar territory, no matter where you are going to hunt elk. I have watched this video many times and will watch it many more in the future. END"
4,AN OUTSTANDING VIDEO FOR THE TRADITIONAL BOWHUNTER.,"I love this video as with all of stoney wolf products it has a emphisis on tradition. Only longbows and recurves here ""compound shooters need not apply"" this is true archery at its best. END"
2,Business in the Zone,"Good valid presentation with sage points, but little new added to the existing body of knowledge."
2,A book which to me seems overrated.,"Having read the laudatory ""blurbs"" on my copy of the novel I was quite disappointed. The text was simply obscure, and the passages in seventeenth-century vernacular quickly became tiresome. I was prepared for something ""macabre"" and ""chilling,"" but instead found myself merely irritated by the book's pretensions, and as for being scared - forget it. This type of thing has been done earlier and better by John Barth, so go out and read The Sot-Weed Factor instead. And as for James Fenton, Joyce Carol Oates, and Jonathan Keates, I'm not sure where their critical faculties were when they puffed this book up."
3,Different Sort of Book,"I am not really sure how I feel about this book. First of all, it was hard to get into after enjoying so much the book I read before this one. And while the premise of _Hawksmoor_ was quite interesting and its writing style and structure was quite different from anything else I have read, I just don't know why it took me so long to read such a short book. It was only 217 pages and it felt much longer! I think that I would like to re-read this book at some point though, because it certainly was entertaining, just very densely written. And it really reminded me of a movie that I saw a long time ago...."
3,Not the best introduction to Ackroyd,"The historical detail in this book is fabulous - I work opposite Christ Church in Spitalfields and I am intrigued to know more about the real Nicholas Hawksmoor. What interests me is where Ackroyd had the idea to make Hawksmoor a Satanist and to interpret the architecture of these churches so as to see occult references everywhere.The story itself, though, was heavy-going and I almost did not finish the book. The book, whilst interesting, was somewhat disappointing compared to Ackroyd's other works. (I previously reviewed this in 1999 and my opinion has not changed)If you are interested in Peter Ackroyd or historical London, his biographies of Dickens and London are terrific."
3,Fascinating history of London but what of the story?,"The historical detail in this book is fabulous - I work opposite Christ Church in Spitalfields and I am intrigued to know more about the real Nicholas Hawksmoor. What interests me is where Ackroyd had the idea to make Hawksmoor a Satanist and to interpret the architecture of these churches so as to see occult references everywhere.The story itself, though, was heavy-going and I almost did not finish the book. The book, whilst interesting, was somewhat disappointing compared to Ackroyd's other works."
2,Not on my list,"I have read more than half of the books on David Pringle's list of the best 100 fantasy books (after working through most of his SciFi list). His suggestions include classics and hidden gems and, unfortunately, a few clunkers. Hawksmoor is one of the latter.Slow but evocative, the book moves back and forth from a time when cathedrals are being built by an architect possessed by an evil force to more contemporary times, where we see the shadow of that force's effect.It is a good concept and well written but very slow going. It can be difficult to build a reader relationship with characters when the scene keeps shifting and Ackroyd fails to surmount that challenge here.This is not a terrible book but it is ponderous without being either enlightening or entertaining. There are better books of fantasy and historical fiction to read. If you are not possessed of unlimited reading time, I might give this one a miss."
2,Disappointed!,"I have read some of the preceding reviews and I must say that the reviewer from Greece was pompous and insulting. I consider myself very well read in fiction and history and I came away from this book empty. Yes, the 18th century part was well written and evocative of that time and place, but I failed to understand the purpose of the whole. The sections in the 20th century were completely unbelievable. I twigged the business about evil, but it didn't mean anything to me. There was nothing new here. I have enjoyed Ackroyd's biographies but this stumped me. I also found the point of view to be extremely anti-intellectual. For a much better depiction of the stupidity of members of the Royal Society, read Longitude!!!"
5,R.I.P. Jeff Buckley,"It has been 9 years since his death and record companies are still releasing some new stuff about him.This album is his third live album and for me it's the best.Although it was recorded from a casette found after his death,the sound is absolutely perfect and you can easily feel the atmosphere.This album was recorded on 6th and 7th of July 1995 at the Olympia Theatre in Paris in 2 soldout concerts and has 11 great songs featuring covers of the MC5's 'Kick out the jams' and Led Zeppelin's 'Kashmir'.This is precious for any Jeff Buckley fan,but if you have no idea about him this is a good place to start."
2,left empty,"Perhaps the author should have written a history of the Northwest, and northern railroads. I found very little of the persona of James J. Hill in this. It is a very historical narritive, not very biographic."
1,Benfini Hair Clippers,I received this product from my mother as a gift and they only worked once. I didn't buy them from this particular seller so I don't know anything about the individual but I wanted to warn others about these hair clippers. I searched on the internet and couldn't find anything other than other bad reviews. Most people stated that the blades vibrate in place but do not cut. We had a similar problem before they quit working completely. I would highly recommend not buying this particular brand of clippers.
3,ehhh,"There first cd was much much better. If you thought their first was to poppy, then this one will drive you nuts. There are a few good songs that aren't annoying, so if you can find this one cheap for the handful of songs then it could be worth it"
4,Rooney - Calling the World,"I'm not sure why Rooney gets slept on so much. They're very under-the-radar. Fans of the Maroon 5 album should be all over ""Calling the World"".This album is what I consider a perfect summer album. Lighter breezier pop/rock songs. Lots of catchy choruses without being cheesey. The songs are short and to-the-point; this isn't an overly drawn-out, bloated affair.I like that the songs are bouncy with good beats/tempos - no real downers here. And you can't beat the price: I assume the low price is intended to draw in new fans, not scare people away that it's cheap for a reason.Really, I'm surprised as to why these guys don't get more publicity. If you could choose a soundtrack for a perfect California summer, this would be the album."
3,maybe the world should just hang up,"Many of the other customers have reviewed this album just as good as Rooney's self titled debut. I really disagree - I preferred many of their older songs because they were more raw and powerful. This album is heavily orchestrated and what I loved most about Rooney on their first album, the wicked guitar riffs and less polished vocals, is completely missing from ""Calling the World."" Also, many of the lyrics are somewhat cringeworthy and a bit immature. That isn't to say there aren't any good songs on here: Calling the World, When Did Your Heart Go Missing?, Paralyzed and Love Me or Leave Me are all fairly excellent songs and extremely catchy, but I feel overall this album is too much of a departure from the band's original sound, and what I liked most about them from the beginning. For first time listeners of Rooney, I would definitely reccomend their first album. For returning fans, I would have to say that this album might be better off overlooked."
2,Entertaining but it couldn't capture my full attention,"The plot caught my attention, but when it came time to read it, I ended up skiping pages. I also couldn't see how the main characters could fall in love. The only time they spent with each other was in bed."
3,Disappointing,"Captive started out very promising, but somehow, everything pretty much fell apart. It could be, that after reading Outlander my expectations were too high, but I just didn't get pulled into this ""time travel themed"" love story.And there were so many unanswered questions! We never found out the connection between Joseph & Murad. Were they the same people? What was Xavier's reaction to Alexandra's pregnancy? Who exactly was ""young Xavier"" and his father in 1996? I suppose we were to infer that they were Alex's and Xavier's offspring, but the story could have been much more interesting if those questions, along with many others, would have been answered. Apparently, there will be (or is?) a sequel. I don't care to read any more about these 2 characters. Anything Brenda Joyce is going to address in upcoming books could have been written about on any of the 400+ pages that were in Captive."
2,Go for Promise of the Rose,"I picked this book up b/c I absolutely adored Promise of the Rose, but this book was a horrible disappointment. First off, I didnt like the main character b/c she had no sense whatsoever, to fall in love with a dead guy without actually meeting him? Strange. But then to continually put her slave Murad's life in danger, stupid. If I was Murad I just would have quit, she was that annoying. The main characters just didn't spend enough time together to actually develope a plausible romance. I would not recommend this book, I really cannot believe its the same author that wrote PotR."
3,Good book...,"It was a good book but the heroine seemed to always be at a loss when it came to what to do next. She was the expert in that time period. She was supposed to know the events surrounding the period. I expected her to use it to her advantage. She was also somewhat weak in character. I really do hope the sequel is different. This was an interesting read though. If you have not read it I suggest you do so. I just had a little trouble with Alex, the heroine."
1,Awful,"Ovewrought, melodramatic characters, an annoying and none-too-bright heroine that is supposed to be independent, intelligent and a scholar of nineteenth century American naval history, sex scenes that don't pack a whole lot of heat...yawn... The hero had potential, though, although what he saw in Alexandra is beyond me."
4,Read This,I was surprised how good this book was. The reviews were mixed and I only bought it because I needed another book to complete my four books for three sale.I really enjoyed this. Their is history that is interesting and the time travel was handled very well. The characters were terrific and if you can get past the OHmygod-you can really love Alexandra.This was great escape reading and fans of time travel should really love the book.
3,Interesting,"This is an interesting book with some good material and many illustrations.It is hard to make out the illustrations on Kindle; use a computer instead.The methods are based on the Filipino art, ARNIS. Though they can belearned as stand alone knife fighting, it would be helpful to take someserious training in Modern Arnis if knives are to be viewed asa serious defensive method.Its worthwhile for those seriously into martial arts; less so for someone whonaively thinks they can learn all they need to know from one book."
5,Cold steel for the man on the street,"I must preface this review with a recommendation: read the other reviews by people who have been there. Never been in a knife fight, but based on reading other knife fighting books and my martial arts training, I must say this is the best book I have read on the subject. Even if you never plan to carry a knife or use it, the techniques covered by Mr. Janich are invaluable. The other books I have read are incomplete, outdated, or are simply vehicles to get you to buy the authors' knives. The grips, stances, and tactics all seem to be logical and well thought out. One thing I have heard from experienced knife fighters: "" expect to be cut "". A must have for the martial artist's bookshelf."
1,Worthless,The only thing you will learn is to not knife fight.Waste of money you will learn 10 times more surfing the internet.
3,Nearing the End,"Rathbone and Bruce made 14 Holmes and Watson films; it's a real shame that four of the weakest are in the public domain and keep turning up while the rest are out of print. This one, from late in the series, at least has the virtue of a script by Bertram Millhauser, who wrote the best of them and was most responsible for the distinctive tone of the series: sly humor mixed with slightly horrific mystery. Two of his most memorable creations, the Spider Woman and the Creeper, went on to lives of their own in other Universal horror movies. As for The Woman in Green, it's a blend of Jack the Ripper and Conan Doyle's ""The Empty House,"" with a nice film noir ambience and some clever twists. Unfortunately, the ending is lame and one senses the fact that, after seven years, 10 films, and hundreds of radio broadcasts, Rathbone has begun to weary of playing Holmes. Film trivia note: someone colorized this a few years ago, and didn't even bother to put Hillary Brooke in a green dress. Go figure."
3,"This is not great, but it is entertaining","With the revival of interest in Sherlock Holmes, it is interesting to see one of the great Holmes, even though the film was produced in 1945. Holmes needs to find out why someone is killing people and cutting off their fingers. There is little in the way of deduction in this film. Holmes discovers the perpetrator by a chance observation at a restaurant. The most exiting episode is where Holmes is apparently hypnotized and told by Professor Moriarty to commit suicide. The later versions of Holmes are much more exiting."

GET THE COMPLETE COLLECTION OF SHERLOCK HOLMES WITH JEREMY BRET AS SHERLOCK !!!!Sherlock Holmes & The Woman In Green"
3,Moriarty Returns in Solid Holmes Entry,"Henry Daniell makes a formidable Professor Moriarty in one of Universal's last Sherlock Holmes mysteries. Running a fast-paced 68 minutes, ""The Woman in Green"" (1945) benefits from Roy William Neill's taut, atmospheric direction. Once again, Basil Rathbone and Nigel Bruce are a pleasure to watch (though screenwriter Bertram Millhauser should have pared down Watson's stereotypical bungling). Avoid the numerous public domain dupes and track down the excellent MPI release."
3,Sinister,"Holmes uncovers another sinister plot. As a Basil Rathbone as Holmes fan, I can never get enough of these films. This was not one of the better entries in the series but enjoyable nonetheless."
3,A nail biter,"Dead women are missing fingers all over London. Inspector Gregson of Scotland Yard (Matthew Boulton) is baffled, as there is no pattern to the madness. Sherlock Holms (Basil Rathbone) on the other hand knows that it is the alleged to be dead Professor Moriarty (Henry Daniell) and the fingers point to a more sinister crime."
4,"Not the best in the Rathbone/Bruce series, but intriguing.","The only rough spot was the coincidence of Holmes mulling over the case in the same restaraunt femme fatale Lydia Marlow is planting the seeds of her dirty work. Holmes was fortunate to see her there with a future victim. If you can get by this, you won't be let down. The intrigue is there, especially in the way the severed fingers later tie in with the plot. Holmes keeps you guessing when he falls under Lydia's hypnotic spell. His use of a bust also makes us wonder...whether or not he's been shot. Great sequence with Watson as he doubts the powers of hypnotism. Overall, the suspense and fun I've come to expect from this series shines across in this one too."
3,Watson To The Rescue!,"Thank heaven for Nigel Bruce as ""Dr. Watson."" Sometimes I think if it wasn't for his humor, some of these old Holmes movies - some - would be too boring to give them a second look. These UCLA ""restoration discs"" also help. The transfers in this film, and the whole set, are fantastic.Most of the Basil Rathbone as Sherlock Holmes movies have at least one interesting villainous character or two, here being the famous Dr. Moriarity (Henry Daniell) and ""the woman in green"" (Hilary Brooke). Of the two, Brooke does a far better job of acting in this movie.As for entertainment, ""Dr. Watson"" was mumbling and bumbling around, which included being hypnotized and was a hoot to watch. Bruce really was an underrated star feature in these Holmes movies even though I enjoy Rathbone best as the great sleuth."
3,Careful. It's a transcription.,"Well played and well recorded, but nowhere in the Amazon listing will you learn these sonatas have been transcribed for baroque flute and harpsichord. If you are looking for the string performances, look elsewhere."
3,Three stars for potential minus 2 for poor effort!,I believe this cartoon had a lot of Potential. I believe who ever wrote the stories for this cartoon weren't even trying. The fashions for the Humans in this cartoon are disgraceful I have seen better designs in the Jetsons! The animation is of execellent quality for a saturday morning. I believe when they bought the rights to produce this show they were in it for quick buck which only screwed them over. I'm no professional in the animation industry but it doesn't take a genius to realize that substance and an involving plot as well as character development make a cartoon series sell. they should have borrowed storylines from the Mega Man X emporium rather than from a cheese batman flick!
5,This movie is very entertaining.,"I watched this video 5 times in 1 day. That may only be because I am a Mega Man fanatic. I think this video is very entertaining because there are a lot of 'bots getting blasted with all kinds of weapons like rocks, or plasma. Mega Man's arch rival, Proto Man keeps him busy, but not for long! You'll have to watch the movie to find out what Mega Man is capable of."
3,okay,Barely 30 minutes of high lights. for the price it would have been nice if it had been digitally remastered. This was a gift to my husband who did enjoy watching it. Go Canes!
4,not fancy but practical,"this laptop, although not adjustable, fits my dell inspiron 6400 (15'4"" screen) perfectly and the design is robust."
3,Don't Really Need CAT6 but I Splurged,"Cable works fine. I'm not really impressed with the wing flaps on each side of the connector tab they use to prevent snags as I think it can get pressed down and leave the tab open to catch on something. I would have preferred a cover over the tab. Otherwise, the cable works fine. Note that for almost everyone at home CAT6 is only relevant if you have a router that has gigabit ports and only for transferring of data between other wired devices/computers. It should not have any effect over a standard high speed internet connection as some reviews seem to pro port. Even online gaming (unless through LAN) will not be boosted. I did an easy speed test (speakeasy) with this cable and another CAT5 and there was no difference. Otherwise, it works just fine for the internet and great for data transfers between the multiple wired computers."
5,SATISFIED CUSTOMER,"The product meets and probably exceeds its intended use, given the nature of video signals."
4,Cable,It seemed to work. Don't know if it is a good cat6 or not because i don't have a way to test it.
5,works!,"I purchased a Motorola SB6120 DOCSIS 3.0 modem and have this connected directly to my computer via a gigabit ethernet port, so far works great."
5,Great cable for PS3,"This was mailed quickly. I use it to run from my router upstairs to my PS3 slim downstairs. Works great and wraps up neatly when not in use. Quality end connections snap in securely. Great price compared to $40-$50 at Target, Best Buy or Wal-mart. Most stores have a max length of 25'. Recommend."
2,Short working life,"I purchased this to connect my Apple TV to my router. This product worked great but the problem is, is that it only worked for about 3 months and is now dead. I've tried plugging this into many different devices and the product still did not work so I decided to purchase a new CAT5e cable from Wal-Mart and it is working great (so far). I guess the saying still lives true, you get what you pay for, cheap cable, short shelf life."
4,Cable is a Cat5e NOT a Cat6,"I added this cable to an order in 2010 with some other items, intended for future use. I connected this cable from my router to PS3 in the other room yesterday. When I unrolled the cable, I noticed it says Cat5e, not Cat6 like the title description. The cable works great and can't ask for more from a $15 cable, but I do know this is not a Cat6 cable. It is only intended for home use, so I guess it doesn't really bother anything."
4,interesting for people with autism in the family,"I have two children with autism and found this book to be very interesting regarding behaviors and how as adults the subjects lived. However the writing gets a little wordy. The author goes on in detail, for instance, on communication problems. Of course you have to remember that the author has autism himself, which makes me understand his need to go into detail. Still you can speed read over the parts in detail and the actual people are very interesting. I could see my children in some of the subjects and it helped me to understand them a little better."
1,this was a waste of my time and money,"How do I put a NO star rating??This book was about 3 autistic co-students ""grown up"".It gave me nothing new or even interesting about autism.Then half way thru the book, he goes on a multi-page rant against the evil Republicans, Bush and the 2004 election. He used one of the co-students as a transition to Democrat versus Republican politics.When I pick up a book that says on the cover that it is about autism, I kind of expect it to BE about autism.It is NOT ""a stunning, invaluable, and utterly unique contribution to the literature of what makes us human"" (as it claims inside the book jacket)TO ME IT WAS A WASTE OF TIME AND MONEY."
2,Hard to cast,"Was very disappointed with this reel...don't believe the Smart Brake technology, this reel will birdnest with the best of them. Release button is very sticky, and hard to depress. Case design is decent, and comfortable on the thumb. This reel does not stack up to the rest of Garcia's overall good product line."
4,Very good little Camera,It works well for the price. Good quality picture and 30 frams per second. Using as a security camera and it has works well.
4,It is incredible that this went out of print!,"You know how fun and useful other almanacs are (World Almanac, etc.).This one focuses on Scripture-related topics.I was astonished to find it in the first place.It saddens me a great deal that it went out of print.If/When it is in print, tell publishers that this kind of information is important, and buy this book! (And contact me!)I have rated it 4 and not 5 stars because I have not checked out its sources. (But then how many check the sources of the World Almanac. Someone should!)I shake my head that Christians have not clamored for this to remain in print!halleluYah! Praise Yah!"
3,"Works, but not the smoothest squaring tool","I use this only when I have to. Yes it pretty accurate and made from nice materials, the only thing that bugs me is the slider wasn't machined to great and nor was the slot on the ruler piece itself. I had file and grind a little bit in order to make the pieces attach properly. The price on this was still pretty good for what it is."
1,You get what you pay for,"The price sounded good, but price isn't everything. The pump simply didn't work, and when I tried pumping harder it came apart in my hands. Don't waste your money. NO STARS!"
2,Worked fine until it broke,"The picture and other clues strongly suggest that this pump is the same pump I bought for approximately the same price some years back in Ace Hardware. Mine is labelled ""High Volume"". It was very handy to carry in the car for emergency and non-emergency use, and would produce approximately 1 PSI increase for every four strokes of the pump. It was possible to use it without application of herculean force, but on about the tenth occasion of use the handle broke, from mere normal hand pressure. It's a cheap hard plastic handle; a metal bar inside the handle length-wise would have prevented the the break, but, alas, there was no such metal bar. Made in China (to, presumably, American design specifications)."
2,not that great,"While this pump is pretty cheap, you certainly get what you pay for. It's hard to use to it its flimsy make up. It takes a long time to pump things up as well. But the bottom line is that it works and it's really cheap. If I did it again, I'd probably upgrade."
1,Do not buy!,"Product is very attractive, gives promise of utility and good appearance.Actual use reveals fatal flaw, in that one broke on the first attempt touse it on a wine bottle. The first section of it, designed to enter the bottle first,broke loose as the handle was pushed down to seal the bottle. Examinationrevealed a broken connection between the flat plate and its cylinder base."
2,Not what I excepted...,"After hearing a lot of the songs used for other Fisher Price music toys, I expected the best from this one. I liked the songs included on the rom, but I expect a nice beat and catchy tune. (Like the Backyardigans or the Doodle Bops). These songs are performed in a dry sort of way. They aren't even as good as the Wiggles and my kids hate the Wiggles. It was a bit disappointing."
5,A lucid introduction to Wittgenstein,"Even though I have an undergraduate degree in philosophy, I did not study Wittgenstein as a student. After receiving a degree in law and devoting two decades to building a law practice, I once again returned to philosophy, and attempted to read Wittgenstein's ""Tractatus"" and ""Philosophical Investigations."" I was at a loss. I simply did not understand what Wittgenstein was trying to say. I then read Grayling's brief introduction to Wittgenstein, which provided a foundation for returning to the original texts. Grayling's ""Wittgenstein"" proved invaluable to understanding Wittgenstein, and I recommend that anyone approaching Wittgenstein for the first time read Grayling's essay before reading Wittgenstein's texts."
4,Wittgenstein Overrated,"AC Grayling, who is a supremely rational and talented philosopher and essayist, has in this little book laid out the basic ideas of Wittgenstein's philosophy, and has clearly demonstrated that they do not make sense. Wittgenstein is accused of anti-realism (he is vague about whether there is an external reality independent of thought and language) and of cognitive relativism (different communities may experience different truths and realities). So, Mr. Wittgenstein, who in the popular mind is a genius of philosophy, is in reality a paragon of irrationality rivaling Derrida or Foucault. Thanks to Grayling, I will never again trouble myself to wonder whether it would be worth the effort to study Wittgenstein. Thank you, AC, for this nice little book."
4,a good introdution from a different perspective,A very short introduction indeed with detailed explanation but not indepth critics. But at least it should be treated as a good starting point of demystifying Wittgenstein's works and also their impact on 20th century philosophical scenes.
4,Very clear,A very clear introduction to Wittgenstein from a skeptical point of view. The book is mostly about Wittgenstein's ideas on language.
2,Hat too small,"Hat says 1 size fits all. Way too small for me and I don't have a large head. Also hat was suppose to be Acrylic and machine washable, yet actual hat is wool and says to dry clean only. I don't recommend, I threw it out."
3,Not a C++ beginner's book!,"If you're new to C++, do not start with this book. Get a book on C++ by Robert Lafore or Tom Swan first and become an expert (Lafore & Swan are both 10 star authors on C++). Then, if you buy Sphar's book, take his advise and skip chapters 1-5, which are the C++ tutorials (start off in ch. 6). Don't waste your time trying to learn C++ with this book. Chapter 6 starts on the goodies of Windows programming w/Visual C++ (the MFC, ApppWizard, etc.)."
1,Someone PLEASE Teach the Author to Outline!,"Beware of books written by technical document writers who fancy themselves authors. Mr. Sphar may have a handle on Visual C++, but has no talent for logical progression. The first 6 or so chapters of the book are especially disappointing, as much of the time is spent mentioning a topic and then explaining that the topic will be explained in later chapters of the book <whew!> or is covered in the Visual C++ help files, and will NOT be covered in the book! The only valuable information I found was in Sphar's recommendation that I obtain the C++ Primer by Stan Lippman. My advice: skip Sphar, buy Lippman"
2,Bad!,"I'm learning Visual C++ 6.0 and needed some books to get started. Learn Visual C++ 6.0 has not been of any help. The book and source is nothing worth you can find these in the MSDN help as well!If you're planning to buy this book, please think twice before doing so!"
3,I did not like this book,This is a poor book. It's main goal is to draw circles and it avoids doing anything usefull. The review of C++ language is too long and that part should be refered to other book. It would not teach anybody who does not know C++ already.
1,Bad for a beginner,As a beginner I got myself tricked into buying this book based on the title 'Learn Visual C++ Now'Was I shocked! As a beginner with only Basic Pascal programming knowledge behind me I could not understand what Mr. Chuck Sphar was trying to say- he spent the first 18 pages discussing HOW TO USE HELP within the MFC environment. That was rather daunting and scary and it succeeeded in putting me off. It was probably the MOST BORING book I have read to date. Definitely NOT FOR BEGINNERS. I wouldn't reccommend this as a starting guide. Bad explanations and lacking structure. A dissapointment.
4,this book is very good indeed!!,"my name is ali and I am a student at westminster uni. As part of my degree, I am doing project on visual c++. The book as helped me a lot and I personally racomaned any one who is studying visual c++ to buy this book now!!"
2,Funny storage stage,"This storage stage is funny and somewhat practical. You have to place products wiyh the same height on the Organizer. When products of various heights are placed on it, there is a chance you cannot see the ones on the back row. This makes it somewhat practical."
3,Looks Good,I'm taking this to my winter house and am unable to judge its value until November. I have similar items now and they work just fine.
5,Great for spices,My spices were taking over my cabinet and this was just the right item to help me out.I love that it is expandable.Sturdy and a very good value .I even ordered a second one !
5,"As advertised, looks great on my counter, sturdy.","Product met my expectations. Getting overloaded with Penzey's spices and this shelf does a nice job. Don't have it expanded, but when I opened it up wider to look it over, it is well done and the expansion joint is not very noticeable. Grips help jars stay put, spacing of rows allows you to see each jar label pretty well. Nice product."
2,The Non-skid gray material came off,"Received the shelf organizer 2 days back, and as soon as I got it out of the box, the non-skid gray material from the 2nd tier was sticking out in a small section near the corner. I pushed it down, and it stayed there for a few hours and then stuck out just like before.I really don't have the patience to send it back and wait for another one, a complete waste of time. I will just stick it with a drop of glue. It's fixable but I am not satisfied with it. Otherwise it works well. My spices are all organized. I have those little spice jars from Ikea and without extending I could fit 6 jar on a single tier. Very happy with that as I have 6 very essential spices, that I use in almost every meal, and it really becomes very handy when cooking.Except for the gray material sticking out, I really like the practicality of the product. Was at the Container Store and saw this same product for 14.99..so much to save $1 :("
5,Great Product,Just received two of these organizers today. They are working great in my new pantry. Love the non-slip aspect of the shelves. Wish they made these for larger cans.
3,It's okay,Not what I thought it would be. It holds a lot of standard spice jars but reaching in to the middle or back shelf is a bit cumbersome. It's hard not to know over spices as you try to take out spices from the middle and back shelf. I just put the spices I use more frequently in the front.
5,Great shelf!,"I bought this to put in my spice cupboard and it couldn't be more perfect! The shelves are wide enough to fit my spice jars (2.5in) and the rise is enough that you can not only see, but also grab the spice above it. I will be buying more for my pantry!"
4,Just what I wanted,This expandable spice rack was just what I wanted. Expands easily and is not flimsy like others I've seen or had in the past. Would definitely order again.
4,Love the Shelves - Hate the Sticker!,"This shelf unit is wonderful! It creates space out of nothing. BUT, the sticker is a bear to remove. If you don't have any Goo Gone, then you need to get some if you are going to buy this shelf unit."
5,My favorite undiscovered writer,"I can't believe Lawrence Sutin has written another book - and this one is even better than the last two. What a fascinating way to structure the story of his life - by using favorite postcards that inspire memories of days gone by. I loved his book about Phillip K Dick - and the one he wrote with his parents, about their Holocaust experiences, is must-read stuff. But this one is the best yet - by turns fanciful, touching and downright funny. Bravo!"
1,Leather?,"I bought this product for Christmas. Based on the picture illustrations, looks like leather to me. The only leather is a suade border at the bottom. Really decieving. I love Columbia products and own many, but this was mis-leading."
3,Collects a bunch of freeware fonts.,"MacFonts basically collects a bunch of freeware fonts on CD and gives you a printed guide. There is also a PDF guide on the CD that you can grab. The software covers the same ground as FontBook, so I didn't explore it much. The CD has a wide variety of fonts, but they're mostly the same ones that you can pull off free font websites. All of them loaded without a glitch. The majority are display fonts, but it also has a handful of serif and sans serif fonts, scripts, dingbats and a bunch of black letter and unical fonts. Nothing on this disk is as well-crafted or fussed over as the fonts you can buy from a type house. However, for less than the price of most professional fonts, MacFonts gives you an instant collection of more fonts than you'll actually use."
2,Deceptive description,"Just got the MacFonts and opened the package to find no printed guide. I tried to install the included software (FontManager), but it would not install on my newer Intel MAC. Got a message that said that the older software would not run on it. The description that Amazon gives says they are OpenType fonts. What it says on the package is that they are TrueType fonts. Not as good as OpenType.I guess for the price, I should not complain, but it would be nice if they give you what is advertised."
4,Nice,Happy with this program. lots of fonts to choose from. Box was not in the best shape but it works well
1,This book is a lie.,"This book is hateful and deceptive. Only gullible people will buy into what it is saying. Its researched poorly and the information that it puts forth is distorted to give an overly sensational and untruthful depiction of Michael Jackson. This is a good man who has been demonized by fools and cynics. So if you want more of the ugly lies that are spreading the earth like a flood about this man, this book is for you! However, if you want to understand the truth about him, I suggest you go elsewhere."
1,A ... Book,read this Book at a local Book Store&thought wow another Journalist went to school to write trashy pieces on Michael Jackson?this Book like alot of the other Negative slant you read on MJ is truly meant for the trash cans.a quick cash in is what is allowed of a Great Artist like Michael Jackson&that truly is wrong in my eyes.things have gotten way overblown.
1,sad,"I read this book. I felt saddened by how Michael is called a freak and picked on so much. He cant even go out in public without people grabbing at him and yelling. My little boy saw this book on my table and said ""mom, why does it say freak on this book"" I told him how some people like to call other people names even though it hurts this persons feelings. I think Michael should just be left alone, there are more important things in this world besides his nose."
4,Freak Insie the twisted world of Michael Jackson,First of all it says From the files of the National Enquirer. They have been sued so many times for writing false stories. And I don't think Nick Bishop did his research very well about Jehovah's Witnesses. Because on pg.114 it says Michael could have heard voices of angry preachers calling hellfire for his sins. Jehovah Witnesses do not believe in a Hellfire. Also it says where his mom Katherine took him to a nun to get help. No way would a devout Jehovah's Witness take someone to a nun to talk to. This shows me that if you didn't do your research on Jehovah's Witnesses than you didn't do an accurate research on the rest of the book.
1,Ridiculous for all Michael fans.,"Instead of congratulating Michael Jackson on his success and his name as the King of Pop, the deadbeat author acts like he knows Michael just because he read things from the National Enquirer..go figure. Although a couple things may be true, most of it is not. The author continually describes Michael as a freak (hence the title) or a creep when he himself most likely doesn't even know Michael personally. He has no right to judge someone he doesn't even know. I always wonder why it's always Michael Jackson that the press decides to nag at. About his face mostly. Whose problem is it if he likes to get his nose done? If they don't like the way he looks, they don't have to look at him. They shouldn't judge a person by the way they look anyway. This book is trash and if anyone wants to read it, I would recommmend not to. Thanks for your time."
1,GARBAGE,"In this day and age where teens are taking their own lives from being bullied, this sort of material well deserves a low score. Bullies are so last season!!!!!!!"
1,Terrible Book,"I have heard about this book and I must say that it's horrible and I refuse to read it. Michael wasn't a freak and this book should of never been written. He was only misunderstood and i really dont like the cover either. This book is distasteful and I refuse to read it and if your a MJ fan like you claim to be, you won't read it either."
1,This book is TERRIBLE !!!!!!,It's full of useless and false information and it was published simple for money making purposes. It was created to try and destroy someone who has cleary achieved more than the author.
2,BE WARY,"I've been looking for an external hard drive for awhile on amazon, and this is the second time i've ran into a bunch of seemingly 'postive' reviews for one that seems like a good deal. however, if you check out the other reviews by these reviewers, all they do is reviews for Calvary products. seems fishy to me. admittedly i havent bought the product but this is just a note of caution to take the other reviews with a grain of salt."
3,This isn't 300GB! Read before you buy!,"I'm really tired of manufacturers claiming that a drive capacity is one thing then you get it and it's a whole lot different. 21 gigs short is way too much. This turns out to be a 279 GB drive. The fan on this thing is horrible! It doesn't cool all that well and when you turn it on the fan makes a nasty sound like the whole thing is about to fall apart. It finally ""calms down"" after a few minutes and you can hardly hear it. I'm really afraid one day I'm going to turn it on and lose everything. A lot of storage for a small price. Seem to good to be true... Be informed!"
1,Steer Clear Of Cavalry,"I'm on my second one and it has failed. Don't rely on these working for more than a year at best. Now I need to go to the Geek Squad for data recovery. So much for back up systems. Don't put yourself through it, get something dependable. They say these Cavalries contain Maxtor hard drives and some say they are good drives. I don't know if the drive is the culprit or something else but Cavalry has failed me twice in a year and left me without access to important files."
3,plenty of space,"i wanted to give it a 5 at first, but i am still trying to work with this external drive. sometimes it works just fine and other times it have's to be plug in my other usb. i am trying to figure out if it is my usb's, or something to do with the drive. other then that i am fairly satisfy with the product."
2,Not the item in the picture,"I was bummed when I opened the box and what they sent me was different than what was pictured. One reason for choosing this item was its looks and I get a different product, but all the numbers matched so I kept it. There weren't any manuals other than a xerox copy of its tech. specs, not very professional. Its works fine, doesn't make too much noise and doesn't get too hot. If I was the picky type, I would be disappointed, but i just needed extra storage..."
5,"Don't miss your ""window of opportunity"" with your child",Rob Parsons has written a wonderful book for fathers ( and mothers) about the ultimately fleeting time we have as parents to develop a strong relationship with our children while they are young. It's one of the best books I've read about the joys and opportunities of parenthood- sixty minutes of reading very well spent!
3,if you didn't see these patterns growing up you had best be warned.,read Dr. Michael L. Hall's book Mind Lines: Lines for Changing mindsand you will never be bullied by any of these unconscious con artists again!
4,Pleasantly surprised,"i have to confess that I've not been a great fan of Transactional Analysis [TA] in the past, probably because a lot of TA practitioners had a certain evangelical fervor about them that conflicted with my 'tool box"" approach to therapy ie no one approach will fit all. Having read this book I suspect that some of my reservations at least came from the popularization of TA [or dumbing down,depending on your mood at the time] via the works of Amy and Tom Harris in their book ""I'm Ok your OK"". Reading Steiner's book reminded me of the refreshingly no-conformist roots to Eric Berne's approach and left me feeling that his whole attitude and ethos is one we would be wise to rediscover. A very helpful explanation to the real contribution and value of Life Scripts as a framework for personal growth and development"
5,Transactional Analysis Applied,"Claude Steiner has given us, in this book, a most valuable resource for understanding how Transactional Analysis (TA) works in real life situations. If you have read Berne's Games People Play then Steiner's book is the logical follow up. Berne describes interpersonal relationships with some very good examples; Steiner gives us the scripts to more completely understand TA. Steiner helps make Berne more understandable and paints with a broader brush as he gives the reader the flesh and bones of TA.Bob Pavelsky, Ph.D."
5,Human traits.,"As a writer of plays and a womb of characters, I found this book valuable as well in a bizzare way comforting. It's the kind of book that you read and think, yeah...so and so was like that...oh wow, that's what they are were doing , and that's why they where doing it, more confronting that's what I'm doing. Anyone who is interested in why people are the way they are should enjoy this book. It won't provide a complete reasoning on the human condition, but it will help a great deal."
5,This song made my European trip a memorable one!,I should have purchased this single in Germany when I was there. I didn't realized it was going to be difficult finding this CD in the states. This song will always be engraved with my memories of Europe/Summer'99 with A.L.
5,THE BEST ALBUM EVER!!!!!,I heard this song in Austria this summer and it was so good that I bought the album there. I listen to it every day!
5,made me crazy !,this CD is really cool. last vacation I was in spain. for the first time I heard that. it made me caray in the night club. so fantastic! strongly recommend this CD
3,Mambo # 5 partly good,I love the original Mambo# 5 and the extended version of the song is also very good and mostly the same. The other two versions however are junk. The Havanna Club Mix version has very little singing and sounds nothing like the orginal and the trumpet mix has NO singing and sounds not one bit like the orignal. I wolud have rathered they weren't on this CD.
2,"Okay, it was good at first, but now.....","I have to admit, this is a pretty good song, but I am so tired of it. Every time I turn on the radio, I hear it. I even heard a different version of it during the World Series with the Braves. Mombo #5 is going to be a one hit wonder. See you later Lou Bega!"
4,"A song that is hard not to listen to, when it is playing.","I think that the video helped to propell the song. All of those pretty women-Monica, Jessica, Sarah, etc. etc. You will enjoy the cd once you receive it. You just gotta have it."
2,It makes women look like toys that men can play with.,I think Mambo no. 5 is ofensive to women. I think he has way to many girlfriends. But I like the tune. That's what counts. So I prefer the baseball one.
1,It's Pants!,"Why do all men seem to view women as ragdolls that they can pick up and drop every few weeks? This song is demoralising, and teaches the younger generation of lads to treat girls badly. Pants, is the only word that justifies this pile of hypocricy."
5,"A excited 47 years ""young"" women from New York.","I heard the song first time two weeks ago, while I was spending my vacation on a French Riviera, in Nice. I heard it again later in Bucharest. The song is all over Europe. So , yesterday, when I heard the song on the radio (103.5 KTU) in New York, I was realy glad that it made it to the States. I can not wait to go to buy the CD."
1,I am so sick of this song. AAHHH,I admit that i liked this song when i first heard it but when you're force fed the song every half an hour on commercial radio stations you start to get so damn sick of it! You start to realise that this is an inoriginal song and its obviously been manipulated so as to sell by the bucketload as it is here in Australia. Lou Bega is so clearly a one-hit wonder that I just have to laugh at the suckers who bought the whole album. Happy listening (or gagging)!
1,wwe ppvs are getting more childish & boring,this wwe ppv is a waste of time and money you want to watch real wrestling check out jcw at least that wrestling company is way better than wwe hey heck its even got icp wrestling in it and yes im gonna say it jcw is way better than wwe
5,End Of An Era.....,This is the one to have.....it's truly the end of an era.....Triple H vs TheUnderTaker.....classic battle.....likely never to be repeated again.....Hunter & Taker give an epic performance (along with Shawn) that truly ends the era of the 'bloody' battle.....I'll be surprised if today's 'super-stars' actually fight like their predecessors. Buy this one now!!!!!
5,Epic Matches,"This is a must see set. Cena vs The Rock. Sheamus vs Daniel Bryan, 18 seconds for Sheamus to become the new World Heavyweight Champion. Loved it."
5,Once in a lifetime,"Where to start. I was fortunate enough to be able to actually be at this Wrestlemania. Have to say it was Excellent! One of the best Wrestlemania's ever. My two favorative matches were Cena v Rock and Triple H v Undertaker (definitely the best match of the night). Definitely a ""once in a lifetime"" experience. The extra's are cool too. Also includes the Hall of fame induction ceremony in it's entirety. Definitely worth buying."
2,waste of time and money,"wrestle mania 28 a huge overpriced, over hyped disappointment-- wrestle mania is supposed to be special with special matches and special guest--most of these matches could have been done on ""Raw"" for free-instead it was way over priced and a huge let down--the Cena/ Rock match was ok but not enough to carry the whole show--the Triple H/Undertaker match was almost the same as last year so why pay to see it again-but most Of WW E's pay per views for 2012 have been like this-and they have the nerve to charge this much and run commercials during it but its all good for Mr McMahon who reportedly made 300 million last year--TNA pay per views costless and are far far better"
2,"Might have good ideas, but...","While I have done enough research to know this books is at times groundbreaking and extraordinarily insightful, I cannot say I gleamed any of this from actually reading the book. Goldberg's prose are dense and difficult to slog through. If you have to opportunity, I suggest you look into other works on race theory -- if nothing else, it may save you a headache."
4,three complete novels,"First time I've read any of LaVyrle Spencer's novels. I was captivated from the very beginning of Years and just when I thought it was happily ever after for the rest of the book, tragedy struck and the character development deepened. Can't wait to read the other two novels in this book."
1,annoyance,The city setting on this unit is terrible. You cannot drive in any halfway busy area without it going off constantly on K or Ka band. My old passport that finally died was 500 percent better than this. I just returned from a drive to Portland Or. and this thing drove us nuts.
2,TOO MANY FALSES,"This radar detector looked promissing and the reviews seemed positive, especially on its predecessor, the 880. What Bel has done is make this one more sensitive, which sounds like it will pick up more cops but all it does it pick up more falses. Its an analogue detector meaning it will go off when anything analogue and digital comes into its beam, cell phones, towers, and especially OTHER RADAR DETECTORS...I had it for 15 days, detected one cop, and it did a good job, but it was way too annoying and would have many sudden KA alerts that were bogus...I now own the 950, a digital detector, and I am much more satisfied..."
4,I've been speeding ever since!,"As far as laser detectors go, this is the one to get. Unfortunately, the advancements have slowed down in the last year. Considering price vs. efficiency, this is the one to get. I have to travel through several states every month for my job, and who knows how many meetings I would have been late for if it weren't for my Beltronics Express 946 laser/radar detector!"
3,Pleased so far but beware....,"This is my first radar detector so I am uncertain of how sensitive other comparable radar detectors are. So far, I am happy about my purchase. I like the clean design and the voice alerts. However, I have a huge problem and so does every prospective BEL purchaser. I recently exhanged my BEL 936 with a different BEL 936 because the packaging of the product caused it to have scratches on the face of the unit. Unfortunately, BEL did not have the foresight to place a transparent strip over the display area to protect it from scratches. Almost every single unit in the store had scratches from the packaging. Check yours before you purchase it. This seems like a huge gaffe on the part of BEL Electronics. Aside from this, The BEL works pretty well."
4,"Mine died, too, but...","I had the same experience with my 906 as did Istephany. I called Beltronics and talked to Wilma who cooperative and pleasant. I had a new unit in about a week - at no cost - and it seems to be working alright after running in the heat on my dashboard. I guess and hope that they found and fixed a part problem. If it dies again, I'll write again."
2,was worthless with laser,Got hit with a laser on the interstate and the machine never made a peep.Was always O.K. with radar but failed when I needed it for laser.
2,Too difficult to understand,"I found that this book was very intellectual and probably meant to be for the more advanced student. If you are a student of theology/christanity- and looking for more depth, this book would be for you."
2,Hmmm,Not what I had anticipated at all. Disappointed with the content there is not much substance. wish I could return.
3,Enteresting,Book is still like new. It is hard to read. Still reading a little bit at night. Not a book that draws you to keep reading and can't put it down. A bit bizarre but does reflect biblical content in a different light.
3,Henoch Prophecies,"For more accurate information on the prophet Henoch/Enoch, consult the material of ""Billy"" Eduard Albert Meier. Specifically in the book ""And Still They Fly!"" there is contained the undistorted prophecies of Henoch who was born in 9304 B.C. The book can be obtained from www.steelmarkonline.com"
1,If you like half a book for the price of a whole...,"So I open the book all excited to read and after one page I notice that the next page is missing. Whoever photocopied this book from it's original only copies half the pages. So if you don't mind just having the even pages then you may love the book. I,however, can't even read it. I am amazed that anyone would pay to bind this and dare sell it. I would not recommend this book!!!!!!!"
5,Katadyn water filter,Great product! Used it on the A.T. back in April when my son & I ran out of water. Found a small stream where we were camping & it worked like a charm.Would recommend all hikers using this product to keep extra coffee filters in the tote bag that comes with the filter. This keeps out the big nasty stuff. thanks Katadyn fora great product.
5,great filter,I used it while camping and it seems to work well. the water was just glacer run off but I believe that dirtier water would be filtered just fine. great quality and very sturdy.
5,great filter!,I wont waste my time writing and also waste your time making you go through it. Read the other 5-stars review... I can sign below theirs 5-stars review. Great filter.
3,survival,Katadyn Pocket Water Micro filter does not fit in your pocket!! That's one big pocket! Second does not operate as well as you would think. Requires two hands to operate pump and hold main body. When you're hanging off a tree limb - not so good an idea. Water volume was a good factor but can be beat by several other products. Weight is another gripe - I've already got lbs of tec. gear and instruments. I can't afford a porter and they talk to much anyway. Guarantee - baloney - already other specialists have come out of the wood work saying that the lifetime warranty doesn't last past opening the box. Best deal was the price because of Amazon so it wasn't a total wash.
1,Katadyn makes junk that will break down in one month,Katadyn has become masters at making junk like this and when it breaks not answering any customer questions. It will always be the customers fault. My equipment broke in one month and I was told after sending it back to them that that was normal? That it will break down every month with day to day use!. They will not help out with shipping or extend the warranty for all the days there junky equipment is being repaired by them. Pass up on Katadyn.
4,Katadyn Pocket Water Microfilter,"I have not been able to use this product in the field (river, stream, lake.) but i plan on using it this spring and fall 2012. i will do a video review on youtube when i do, my username to view the video is flyndublin check it out. i really like the durability of this product. what sold me is the stats. check them out.

5,may stay at my favorite campsite,"I have been trying to decide what filter to buy. Purchased the Katadyn Pocket a few weeks ago. Know why? On my next camping trip, I may just stay there!"
5,Great filter,I've drank out of the toilet with this one. WITH a fresh turd in the water. I believe in testing my equipment before depending on it in the field.
5,Katadyn Pocket Water Microfilter,Great little filter. Easy to use and not too heavy for backpacking or using in a base camp.Katadyn Pocket Water Microfilter
1,Every Street Is Paved With Gold : The Road to Real Success,"This book's credibility is suspect, to say the least. The author's company is now insolvent (as of March 2001) and he has gone into hiding after allegations of embezzlement."
4,Enjoyable CD,I really enjoy this CD. It has some good choices to just enjoy or get your hip scarf on and shimmy to!
4,Great poster.,"I love the material its on, very professional and nice looking. The shipping time was reasonable, i would get it if you are a stripes fan."
4,Great price.,I bought this jacket because I was going to buy it at a department store for $130. One night I was on amazon and came across it. I didn't have to think twice. I bought one in olive and one in ivory. The only complaint is that the fur is attached to the hood with buttons. The buttons get stuck in my hair all the time. Other then that so cute!
3,The Great Fire book review,"I thought that the book, The Great Fire, was good in some ways, and bad in other ways. Some of the bad things were that it was really hard to follow. I thought that it was hard to follow because there were many different story lines going on at the same time, and they switched them around to quickly. I also think that the book was boring because it was basically just about people running from the fire and losing their families. I thought that all of the stories about what happened to people during the fire were basically all the same. Some of the good things about the book were that it was full of facts about the fire. It also told the real story about what happened to people during the fire, what caused the fire, and what helped to stop it. Overall I thought that the book was kind of interesting but hard to follow, and that it was boring, but factual. I didn't think that this was the best book I have ever read, but it wasn't the worst either."
3,The Great Fire,"The Great Fire of Chicago happened in 1871 on a dry Sunday. The fire began in a barn and swept throughout the city. Through the author Jim Murphy the book takes you through the lives of many people. Eventually it rains, extinguishing the fire and leaving 98,500 people homeless. The Great Fire was one of those books that starts out boring, but if you continue to read or listen to it you'll notice yourself wanting to know what happens next. This book goes through the lives of the people during the fire and shows their hardships through great detail. The Great Fire was caused by many mistakes including a tired fire department. They did all they could, but were unsuccessful because they were unprepared for such a disaster. I would recommend this book to people searching for a good historical non-fiction book."
5,"""Classical Confidence""","Both children and adults need to be nurtured by beautiful words and images. ""Classical Confidence's"" positive affirmations and beautiful music causes the heart and mind to soar! We love to listen to several segments in the morning to set the tone of our day. Listening to this CD will certainly brighten up your outlook."
1,Not my favourite course material.,"The authors seem to believe that dumbed down language and bad grammar will be more palatable for some readers. That may be true for some, but in my opinion, it makes it an irritating and difficult read. The perspective is very narrow, and there isn't very much real thought provoking discussion. What I also find off putting is that the authors seem to ""walk"" the reader through a situation, telling you what you would do or think. The authors meander aimlessly around the point before finally getting to it, making it pretty difficult to follow. This book reads like a rambling child who thinks very highly of his own intelligence."
2,A Reviewer,"A decent general overview of its subfield, but not exactly well written. Also, it assumes rat choice is viable on its own, not even acknowledging the work of Chong and others who have been able to couple rat choice with qualitative methods to great effect.In summary, a somewhat narrow view for an ambitious title."
5,Best In the Series,"Brazilectro 5 is by far & away the best in the series -- even manages to outdo Brazilectro 2, which is no small feat...Of course, as in all the Brazilectro series, it is not without its own ""what were they thinking?!"" moments (such as the opening track on cd 2), but oh well...The packaging is beautiful, almost like a book, with some really great pics of Rio inside.Trippier, Funkier, Jazzier & altogether Juicier. Several tracks heavily influenced by Jobim. Highly recommended. If you are struggling to buy just one CD in the series, I would encourage you to get this one (but I would go ahead & get #2 while you're at it...)"
3,More of the same--in every way.,"For all intents and purposes this book is no different than the same author's book titled ""Earth From Above 365 days"". My comments are the same for this book as I wrote in my review of the other book;dated October 7,2004.The only difference is in the pictures. There are both good and poor aspects to this book and I have elaborated on them in my other review."
2,A big mistake,"I could give 5 stars for the pictures but becouse of a big mistake, stars come down. Okay the photos are good but somewhere I am very dissapointed. On page August 22, where the comments for the picture were about the genocide of Jewish, it was written that Turks did the same thing to Armenians. But that was a lie. Some nummamorous people told this allegation and the writer believes them. This is very sad. If someone writing a book, he/she must be very careful about his/her words. Books must not contain allegations. Or author must tell that it was an allegation, unless it is proved."
2,Beautiful photos spoiled by propaganda.,"The photos get 5 stars, Unfortunately, the text is a constant stream of preachy eco-alarmism. Various leftwing ""intellectuals"" introduce each chapter with astonishingly naive tracts: the one on ""poverty"" could have been exerpted directly from the communist manifesto.Enjoy the photos, but ignore the text and read instead Lomborg's ""Sceptical Environmentalist"" and Norberg's ""Defense of Global Capitalism"""
5,perfectly done,"This swedish group from a small town Karslkoga is making not only a copy of famous have metal formations. They really play fresh metal, with excellent skils. Singer has an accent but it doesn't dissturb to listen to his good vocal. Excellent drummer, very young (I know him personally) 19 year-old, plays like long- experienced rocker. He recorded all trucks by memory within one-day-session. Incredibble! Everybody, who like metal, should have this CD ! That is pitty the group doesn't exist any longer!"
1,Have to be an acid to watch,I must have been yet sleep when I hit the order button. Not worth the time. Take my word on this.
1,Yuk,"It was frustrating trying to follow this. Too fast paced for my taste. Anyone who likes a very fast paced, highly choreographed routine should like this."
5,Fun workout!,"First off, I should mention that I'm a Cardio Klutz. I've never liked a Hi/Lo workout because it's always hard for me to get the moves down. Not this time! I think Amy's cuing is spot on. I agree that some of the moves take up a lot of space, but I'm able to modify in the small are I have without sacrificing a good workout.For those who don't have a lot of time, Amy includes options that allow you to make the workout shorter. If you want to add weight work, she also includes options from her All Pump Xtreme workout. This workout is very versatile and is a good value for all you get."
2,Not what I expected,"There is no cueing what so ever in this workout, so unless you do this workout a few times you will have to really try to figure out her steps. She doesn't break the moves down and it's a complete space hog. Unless you have a lot of room several of the moves are difficult to perform. I tried doing this in my workout space in my basement and found I don't have enough space. It's very high energy but I think had the moves been broken down before going full throttle it would have been more enjoyable. This one is at the bottom of my pile and doubtful I'll be using this any time in the future."
2,Bad... Not what I expected,I am an advanced workout person and I found this video to be really hard to follow due to the lack of cueing and fast pace. A large area is needed to do this workout so if you do not have a big space do not waste your money on this video. If you like really dancey workout videos this could work for you it did not for me.
4,Workout Review,"This is a great workout. The upbeat music keeps you right on track, but it takes about two workouts to pick up the steps since there is not an explanation or demo before the routine. I would recommend this for the intermediate/experienced level."
5,Love this video!,"If you want a different kind of workout-- but that works you hard- this is great! Amy has four different combos, which are not too dificult to pick up (which I have found with some of Cathe's videos) and that give you a fun cardio workout. I am advanced and love this. She has so many different mixes that you can do different things everyday- highly reccommend."
3,Opening For Broadway,"There was no denying the power of Elton John's music thrught nearly 30+ years in the industry. Yet, he was never able to accomplish making something happen on Broadway. When he started composing the music for Aida with Tim Rice, who also worked with Elton composing the Oscar-winning music for The Lion King, they had no idea of how dynamic it was. With Written In The Stars, his duet with Leann Rimes, it really gained the upcoming Broadway show and exposure. Still, I thought that it was the only song from Aida worth listening to, the various artists compilation Elton John appeared in, not the Broadway cast album. Still, Aida is a very big hit now, thanks to Elton. Hopefully, he'll do another song like this one."
1,it stinks!!,"If Elton keeps putting garbage like this out, he will soon find himself with no fans. YUK!"
5,one of the most powerful songs I have ever heard !,Elton John nd Leann Rimes at their best! This song should receive an Academy Award. It really stirs the soul.
4,Dolphin Tales - True Stories of the Atlantic Spotted Dolphin,"I loved the way this book drew me in a made me a part of swimming with the dolphins. The photos are great and I learned so much about the dolphins too. I particularly like the way Scott will tell a story, such as Caico Feeding Robin, then follows that story with details on the dolphins' feeding behaviors. It's nice to get a detailed book that is not so PhD-ish... and to learn that dolphins play actaul games! WOW! This is a great book with something for everyone."
4,A Wondrous Adventure!,"Wow, what an enchanting little book! I knew nothing about wild dolphins, before I found this engaging and beautifully photographed gem. I hope they'll make a movie out of it someday, so I can actually watch the dolphins playing with their human friends. I highly recommend it to those who still believe in magic!"
1,Too many problems to list,"This laptop is a worthless piece of junk! I am so angry right now, that I don't even know where to begin. Disc drive is cheap and flimsy, windows vista is horrendous, keyboard has broken twice and Sony had to send someone to do something to the ""motherboard"". It took 3 months for them to respond the first time. For some reason, it doesn't seem to be compatible with Apple's Itunes. Everytime you download pictures, they go to several different places, whether you want them to or not, each one more confusing than the next. Mouse pad is touch and go. You can not play any sort of game that requires fast mouse movement. I could go on and on. Please consider a different laptop."
3,"Good computer, lousy documentation","I am very satisfied with the performance of the computer. I am not very satisfied with the documentation that came with it. No advice was given on the possible problems that Vista might cause with incompatible software, and I had big trouble: upon installing Photo Impression 5, the DVD drive stopped working, and System Restore did not help, or work at all. Had to call Sony support to finally (10 days later) resolve the problem. Solution consisted in reconfiguring the computer from the start, which led to loss of data and the consecuent aggravation."
1,Horrible. Stay Away,"I have had nothing but problems with this laptop. The DVD cannot read half the discs that I put in it. The audio doesn't work. There are all kinds of preinstalled programs on here that i can't uninstall. To boot, the customer service is terrible. I never had these problem by IBM."
4,Good But Not Great,"Couple of noteable curios in this selection: Decoy and Tension are worthy entries flying under the radar. The Big Steal is more fun than noir. However, They Live By Night and Side Street nearly steal the thunder from the others. The former can now be classified as a classic."
3,Farley does not measure up,"The Farley Granger disk containing ""They Live by Night"" and ""Side Street"" disappoints because it is not film noir as we have come to expect it. Where is the femme fatale? Those who recall Lizabeth Scott in ""Dead Reckoning"", Lana Turner in ""The Postman Always Rings Twice"" or Marilyn Monroe in ""Niagra"" will feel cheated. Cathy O'Donnell is no bad girl in either of the Farley movies. The Farley movies really are more aptly described as a love story (""Night"") and crime drama (""Side Street""). Though there is no bad girl in ""The Big Steal"" either and its lighting and story frame it more as a chase movie, its interesting to watch the great re-teamed chemistry of Robert Mitchum and Jane Greer who were the epitome of film noir in ""Out Of The Past""."
1,Bad Mastering - DO NOT PURCHASE,"I own 4 DVD players. Use them all the time. An expensive Sony, a portable Sony, a region-free player and the DVD drive in my computer. 2 out of these 5 disks would not play on anything but the computer. They either registered as no disc or froze up at the menu screen.Great movies, but I didn't expect to have to watch them on my laptop."
2,WAY too small,"I can't fit anything inside it! Well, except the GBA itself. But my AC adapter, Mad Catz faceplate cover, and my 'hood'-type light don't fit. If you just have the GBA and a few games, it's fine, but otherwise, get something bigger."
3,"Official Case good, but by no means great","This is the official case for the GBA and its pretty good. It has a padded compartment for the GBA itself and a small zippered pocket on the front flap. Its good points are its nice and compact, and its official. There are a couple of major downsides though. Its so small you can only fit in the Game Boy Advance and about 3 games! Theres NO room AT ALL for any link cables, AC adaptors, spare batteris, or lights. Its ok if you dont have any accesories and you only want to carry a couple of games with you, but if you want more than that you'll need a bigger, better and more functional one than this. I live in the UK and I have an HMV one which is very good but im not sure if you can get them in the US."
5,Great Case,"It is small, and fits a good amount of things in it. I am going on a summer trip, and I wanted to find a good case to hold my GBA so I won't lose my games or my gameboy. My little brothers friend got this case (in a different color) and it was great looking and he loved it. The case fits the GBA and protects the screen from getting scratched or broken. The case also protects 8 of my GBA games, and stores them so they won't get lost. However, if you have a lot of items, such as multiple GBAs or GBs, or bulky items, such as the recharging battery pack (20 or 15 hr.), I suggest you store it elsewhere."
1,!WARNING!,"This might seem like a great GameBoy Advance Case but it isn't. Every time you put you GBA in or take in out, the screen rubs up against a rough material, which causes it to get fine scratches up and down of the GBA's screen. My GBA's screen got scratched because of this darn case, and I just thought i'd warn you so yours wouldn't get scratched too."
3,A great case for people who don't carry many games,"When I bought this case, I got it on sale for [price]. Otherwise, it is the worst choice for the price that it is here. You can carry up to 3 GBA games and 2 GBC games. I haven't tried fitting that many games, but I am sure that if other people have more, they can fit extra. I would rather get a dark blue color though. The neck strap is very helpful and so is the velcro when you are travelling to a public place. These are a little more compact than other cases though. Save your money on this and buy a Transporter by Bensussen, Deutsch & Associates or others that you find in Traveling Kits."
1,You need more space!,When I first got my GBA It was OK. I didn't have many games so it worked out. But know that I have several games its packed and i can't fit any thing else into it. If you put it in the wrong way it scratches your screen If you have tons of games this isn't for you.
5,Best books for stamp identification and values,"If you are still collecting stamps and I hope you are, these stamp catalogues are a necessary part of your collection. Without them many stamps will go unidentified. Having the correct knowledge is a very important part of life. These catalogues are as essential for stamp collectors, as tires are for cars. Without them you will not go (or learn) very fast."
5,Super Cat to the Rescue!!!,"For parents who have to read the same books over and over again to their kids, SuperCat is a great book. It is more interesting than most kids books. The illustrations are great and the tempo of the story makes it a fun read even the 50th time through. We have both SuperCat books. I wish there were more."
4,A Russian Refresher,"If you studied Russian 25 years ago, traveled to Russia, enjoyed the culture, but haven't spoken Russian for over 2 decades, this is your book.Seriously speaking, if you have ever studied Russian and need a refresher course, buy this book.I was happy to discover that this book was NOT for novices but for past students of Russian. It's worth the money, and then some."
5,great funny CD,"I managed to obtain the full CD while overseas and it is really good! Upbeat, irrelevant, and funny. Good buy and I recommend it highly."
5,Dr. Bombay will be a hit - More fun than Aqua!,"This is Dr. Bombay's newest release. The other two: Taxi Driver and Rice & Curry, are just as fun and up beat. If you like to dance and have fun music this is the CD for you. I'm looking foward to the release of the full CD."
2,Asimov was running out of ideas at this point.,"I like the whole Black Widowers idea, but the stories in this book -- and in the series as a whole -- are a mixed bag at best. Some of the mysteries, and Henry's solutions, are clever. Others are way too obscure. Example: To solve one mystery, Henry had to know not only an Edgar Allen Poe poem (not ""The Raven""), but also the names of the stars in the constellation Perseus -- along with the meaning and derivation of the names. If Asimov had to stoop to such esoteric depths to come up with Black Widowers stories, that should have been a clear indication to him that he should discontinue the series."
5,Excellent book for teachers and parents,"I have been reading your ""The Complete Guide to Service Learning"" the last few days. I am teaching teachers tomorrow about the 40 Developmental Assets and integrating Service Learning into their curriculum. Your book is great. It is thorough. It is user friendly and it has great information that is easy to digest. I especially like the ""Across the Curriculum"" sheets."
4,Not a perfect translation. But give's insight.,"While this translation is not perfect word for word compared to other's it does offer insight into this great work. Now to rate this book as terrible simply for the fact of imperfect translation is a shame becouse is does have much to offer.The Gita is a wonderfull work. Mitchell does not butcher bad enough that the concept is lost. You will come away from this read feeling refreshed and enlightend. Do not worry about the translation the idea's are in this book. It allways upsets me when I read complaint's about Hindu translation's, many book's like the Mahabhrata have been added to since there conception. So if that's the case what is actually the true translation? What count's is the message and this book present's it well."
5,Bhagavad Gita : A New Translation,This is an excellent translation and Mr Mitchell's assertion that the 12-18 chapters of the gita are less spiritually evolved than the first 11 are well justified. This is not just his opinion but also among many indian schools of thought. Anyone tuned to the message of the gita will clearly notice the contradiction between the first 11 and the subsequent chapters. The latter chapters dwell too much on duality and absolute classifications which are more in the tradition of the philosophies (or shud i say practices) coming from the middle east.
3,This is a Hindu Book,This is a book based on a Hindu belief and has alot of love type things in it. This is not recommended unless you are studying this culture.
5,The most accessible translation I've read,"I've read and/or studied the Bhagavad Gita in at least six academic classes over the years, as well as discussion groups on retreats and at yoga studios. Stephen Mitchell's translation is, by far, the most accessible of any I've read. It offers an easy introduction to the world of the Gita to any level of experience with the work or its tradition as a whole. Highly recommended, especially for newer scholars."
4,Bhagavad Gita,"I enjoyed this book and found it very easy to follow. I especially liked the explanation of the three basic types of personalities and how each of us may be part of all three, yet dominated by one type. The poem reminded me of the Tao Te Ching in style, but The Bhagavad Gita used a metaphor in story form to explain how to understand oneself. Now that I have read this book I may look more into other teachings, such as, the Kaballah next. The use of the battlefield and conflict arising from people choosing to fight against members of their own family, provided an excellent backdrop for learning about Karma and the other beliefs of Hinduism."
5,Gita,Written to easily understand. Was recommeded for my Yoga Teacher Training and it's beautifully written even a lay person can read it.
2,A great disservice to humanity,"Although Mitchell has writing talent, he obviously hasn't taken the teachings of the Gita to heart. The Gita must be understood from one who understands its truths, who lives his life by its truths. Mitchell may be able to write nice poetry based on the Gita, but without the devotional attitude Lord Krishna recommends, his poetry is a disservice to humanity and useless gibberish. Though pleasant to read, it is ultimately misleading. For a much better introduction to the Gita, try Carl Woodham's Bhagavad-gita, The Song Divine. Written by one who has practiced the principles of the Gita for over 35 years, its spiritual truths shine through."
4,Wonderful Introduction to Indic Thought,"After having read this three times I can say that Stephen Mitchell provides the reader with a wonderful introduction to Indic thought. Some poetic license is taken in the translation, and some verses seem to be more fabrication than translation, but overall this is a great place to start. The book might be rather simplistic for the more well versed reader, but the beginner will find it rather useful. Well done."
5,Classic Old School Black Metal,This is what pure Black Metal is. This cd is is just killer and any Metal fan would really enjoy this. Ace was a true pioneer in this form of metal. Even though Venom and Celtic Frost were very influential to Black Metal Bathory was the very first 100% Black Metal Band. Come to think of it Venom and Bathory music wise have simularities but Ace was the first to use the Black Metal Vocals (aka Linda Blair Shrieks) and the guitar white noise feed back which is commonly used in Black Metal.I own the first 3 Bathory albums but this by far my favorite and in my opinion Bathory's best.If you are just getting into Bathory or Black Metal this album is a great starting place.R.I.PQuorthon
4,An Early Classic,"Of black/death music. It's primitive, but it rules and is somewhat hard to find Get this and hear a band who has influenced all the current modern black metal bands!"
1,Misrepresented,Item did not include knob even though it's pictured. If you need a knob go elsewhere; American Lighting said tough luck.
1,This hat stinks!!,This is the worst hat I have ever ordered. It goes from a terrible color that did not show up on line when I ordered it to a really crappy piece of material. I was so disgusted that I gave to my dog to chew up so it would never be sent anybody once again. The dog didn't like it either....he puked!!
2,Comments on Song of Nevada,"Visual quality of this video is fair to average. The sound track is good. This is a 54 minute cut version of this title. The original theatrical release had a running time of approximately 75 minutes. Uncut versions of this film can be found in private film collections, but none are known to be available on home video. This 1944 release is one of the first 3 films Roy starred in with Dale Evans. It is too bad that this title is not available on video in its original full length form, as this is one of the better Roy Rogers films."
3,"Easy to follow, but it doesn't taste authentic..","I tried three classic Indian recipes off if this book and none of them tasted ""great."" Of course, it was good but I didn't think it was great. They do recommend adjusting amount on some of the ingredients to your taste, but it is extremely hard to do when you are using over 10 spices. I was just a little disappointed in the results."
2,mild,"If you follow the recipe's quantities of spices, the food turns out fairly bland. Also, 1000 should be divided by five since many recipes are repeats with prawns, chicken, vegetables, fish, and beef."
5,Too good,"Its very nice book and have all the necessary collection. nicely structured, 1000 recipes at one place. I would suggest it to all."
2,Hot stuff!,"I love Indian food. And, I live very close to the right neighborhood in Chicago to get it whenever I want it. I thought I'd try my hand at home. But, I think this can not be taught in a book. Perhaps I should have been alerted by the fact that the author's name is Wendy!"
5,Typical Cold Steel,Both of these knives came extremely sharp out of the box. The sheath is good and has a friction fit that I have had no problem with loosening over time. The handle is a bit small in diameter but I have large hands so this might not be a problem for everyone. I keep one in my EDC bag in the jeep. The price is no indication of the quality of these blades.
5,Excellent Knife! Excellent Price!,"This is a great little knife for the price. Arrived razor sharp, and seems to hold an edge very well. Much better than expected for a knife in this price range."
5,Great buy.,"Great size for a neck knife or a second carry in the woods.Arrived sharp but with 10 swipes of a fine diamond stone and it was shaving.The triangular grip will take some getting used to but it has a nice texture for holding.Only drawback (for me) is that its not carbon steel so it does not work well with firesteels.Nothing else I can say, its a great small knife."
5,Cold Steel Finn Bear Sheathed Knife,"I like cold steel products and alot of them are quite expensive, but for the money and my needs, this is a well built knife that appears will last and endure the weather and use."
3,Nice outdoor knife for cheap price,"You get what you pay for. Finn Bear cheap, but well made outdoor Puukko style knife. If you backpaking you'll appreciate that knife is very light. However I do not feel comfortable with Finn's triangle plastic handle :/ Knife sleeve is cheapest as you can get but holds knife strong enough in tact.Overall good knife for the price ;)"
2,Very Uncomfortable in the hand. Sheath is junky,"I do a lot of bush crafting in the woods with my knives, and I found this knife to be extremely uncomfortable to hold. The handle is essentially a tear drop shape in cross-section. I also found the sheath to be quite poor quality.I personally prefer a mora to this knife."
5,Finn Bear in the kitchen,I use mine in the kitchen as opposed to the intended purpose of an outdoors knife. I absolutely LOVE it! I gave it a few strokes on the strop and VOILA! Instantly my FAVORITE kitchen knife.
4,Amazing,Came razor sharp out of the box and did it job. Also The knife is esay to sharpen but doesnt hold a edge as good as the recon one or tanto.
5,Finn bear,"Awesome knife, inexpensive, high quality, holds a great edge, I carry it with me all the time, you will not get a better knife for the price."
4,Excellent knife,"Great knife, especially for this price. I'm very happy with the performance, size and durability of this knife. I would expect no less from Cold Steel."
1,amazing but boring for most,"I got this CD from secondspin.com for $5.99 or something; I was interested because the drummer Jason Sherlock was once in Mortification. This is the most unique and evil-sounding Christian death metal that I've ever heard. The anti-Catholic song sucks, of course. What a joke! Are there any real arguments for protestantism? Fortunately, one can't understand anything anyway. Just don't read the lyrics, and it's fine."
2,it was most definitly pumped up!,were I saw this cd was were I decided I just HAD to have this CD. It was made out to be this intense CD. What a huge disappointment. That is why I am soooo hesatent to buy a CD. You spend $25-30.00 after S/H and you get 1 song and if your lucky 2. wow. I give it 2 stars because the 1 song was 2 stars worth.
1,landscaping estimating methods,"It simply sucks. It does not help with estimating in a landscape company. Also it's too difficult to understand and too complex. All I wanted to know is how to estimate walkways patios, decks, tree removal, etc.... This book does not do it. [...]you will see how bad this book is.."
1,Not very usable/practical,"Fortunately I checked this book out from the library so I didn't get stuck with it. I got it with the intention of using it to estimate residential landscape construction projects. However, it just wasn't straightforward or practical enough to be of use. Really theoretical but doesn't give necessary info to use it in my landscape design-build business."
5,This is the one you need.,"I looked at this and the Rough Guide to Iceland, and if you're making a visit to Reykjavík this is the only guide you need. The style is chatty and down to earth, with masses of useful information for the visitor--especially good sections on eating in the city, and on galleries, music venues, and museums. Some of the small details (like descriptions of menus) could be updated, as could info on public internet access (v.cheap at the City Library), info on phoning abroad, and contact info for Hotel Loftleier. Dixon's grasp of Reykjavik life, though, is excellent--insightful, hip, yet generous and inviting. A great guide."
1,circus mirror!,This mirror actually made me laugh because it was like a circus mirror. The image was so distorted you couldn't tell what you were looking at!!! I could sort of tell it was a baby--- no way could I even identify my baby though that mirror--- awful don't waste your money!!!
1,Absolute Junk,"In addition to the cheap mirror mentioned in other reviews, this item is very difficult to position correctly and stay in place. Not recommended."
1,Garbage - literally disintegrates after two months,"A complete waste of money. Eddie Bauer used to be a premium brand, but now the name is simply licensed to manufacturers who churn out cheap Chinese-made junk products.After only two months, the straps that hold this mirror to the headrest didn't just break, they literally DISINTEGRATED INTO POWDER.I had thought these straps were nylon, but apparently they are made of whatever low-grade plastic waste the manufacturer had laying around at the time."
5,In time for the holiday.,DVD arrived in time as the perfect Christmas gift to my 11 year old twin god grandsons. This piece is creative and compelling. Mr. Abdul-Jabbar's presentation of this obscure slice of history is thoroughly engaging for any age.
2,For the professional mathematician,"A bit too over my head. Really a book for the professional, not the amateur. I love math, as explained in a college textbook, but this book was a bit too Poincaire-brief and condensed for me. I need a more verbose, baby-steps book.So that's why I'm giving it two stars. Of course, once you are a master, then less is more.I did give it away to a professional mathematician, who liked it."
3,a good album !!,"it's just a good album. far from the best bathory album, but very good. depressive and slow viking metal. i recommend it, but don't buy it as your first bathory album. hammerheart and blood fire death are really much better."
2,Disappointing,"A fairly poor album. Quorthon's guitar is noticeably (and painfully) out of tune in several acoustic passages, and his attempts at clean vocals (as opposed to the harsh guttural vocals of earlier albums) are almost laughable; he is almost unable to carry a tune. The songs are rather monotonous musically, though the lyrics are interesting. The last track (with music from Gustav Holst's ""The Planets"") is not a very good blending of metal and classical (if you like that mix, listen to Therion). Overall, this was a disappointment after being introduced to Bathory with ""Under the Sign of the Black Mark""."
4,Heading towards a more epic sound.,"I recently started listening to Bathory after hearing a few songs online. I figured I'd buy, ""Blood, Fire, Death,"" then, ""Hammerheart,"" and so on chronologically. This album moves towards cleaner vocals, longer guitar chords/notes, and a slower drum beat. I personally prefer singing over screaming, and straight-ahead hard rock guitar sound as opposed to a speed metal guitar. Some of the music is sort-of filler, but even then it's not bad!"
3,John Morris Wanpler,"I was researching a relative who served in the 2nd Rgt Engineers, PACS, and there is not much information available on the three Confederate Engineer Regiments. This book is more of a biography of Wampler, who was a staff officer and not a line officer in an engineer organization."
4,I Can Play My Records Again!,"I really do like this product a whole lot. Assembling the record player wasn't really difficult and took about half an hour tops. As for the software that comes with it, I don't like it at all. I personally use Audacity which is free for download and more versatile. But the sound quality is good, and I bubble with excitement each time I put in a record. C'est magnifique!"
5,Software program,"This product is all of the good things that previous people have said that it is. One thing that I will say, the cakewalk program is not compatible with older mac's. You must have a new intel mac for the software to work. Therefore, I can not fully evaluate that part.The instructions are a little tough if you are not careful, but by checking off each step you will have a better idea of where you are. Take your time and it should go well.Bill Williams"
4,Audio-Technica AT-PL120S Review,I am very happy with the AT-PL120S. It was easy to set up and it is easy to use. It came with Cakewalk software which makes it easy to copy old songs from LP's to CD's. And the price was very reasonable. My only complaint is that the AT-PL120S is not automatic. But that is my fault. If I had read the description I would have noticed that the turntable is manual.
3,Cheap clone of the Technics sl1200,This turntable is not more than you pay for. It is a cheap copy of the Technics sl1200. But it is what I need for listening to my few aging LPs.
1,Not for DJs,"I'm a DJ who's going prime time and looking to upgrade my equipment but save a few bucks too. So I bought this turntable because it was close to the standard Technics. Obviously not close enough. I connected the Audio-Technica to my system and started to spin, cut, scratch and back-spin. After 2 minutes I unhooked the turntable, repacked it and shipped it back to Amazon for a refund. The needle weight was off or something because the cartridge scraped into my record. The torque was slow and weak on cuts and spinbacks. The turntable handled like a car without power steering. DJs, stick to the OG...Technics 1200."
1,Unable to ship to Alaska or Hawaii?,How lame is that? Do they need help to figure out how to ship stuff economically via USPS? Have they even heard of USPS?
5,Excellent explanation,"I bought this book by chance. But, I realized no other books cannot be compared with this book. other books say how I could rearrange the layout and order of my documents. This book teaches how I should write the sentences and paragraphs and the sections in scientific fields. This is very useful for nonnative speakers of english especially!"
5,It is an excellent book for students from all disciplines,"Technical writing is essential for all university students because if they can write efficiently and express themselves well and precisely, it will be easier for them to relay their ideas to others and hence find jobs easily, write well balanced reports, and more importantly perhaps know what they are writng and talking about. The more organozed one's speech or writing is, the more effective one will be. Non-native speakers of English, however, do not think oral and written communication is that important but once they use this book in an English class under the guidance of their teachers, they ABSOLUTELY CHANGE THEIR IDEAS I recommend this book to all teachers of English teaching English at freshman or sophomore level."
5,Excellent for scientific writers!,"All scientists need to write and this is the book they need to read. This book teaches scientists how to communicate effectively by writing clearly. Unlike most of the writing books, this book targets the scientific writers. For example, it explains what the introduction section in a journal paper is supposed to do. I highly recommend this book to all research professionals."
3,Good - but not worth 10$,"This is a good product: nice hard case, a (quite useless) promo card decided by the tin it is in, two randomly selected booster packs.The case is pretty good: plenty of room to carry a deck in a protector, space to keep damage counters and coins, but not the best. If you are a hardcore pokemon-er, you would get one of the ultra-pro ""Satin"" cases (for ten dollars).The promo is a nice bonus, but the cards (as far as i know), aren't very good. Don't hold me to this, but i know that the Rayquaza tin comes with a promo Mudkip. the other ones have Torchic and Whismer, the last i'm assuming is a treeko. None are very good. If you like shiny versions of commons, you'll like it.The boosters are nice, but ten dollars, you should be able to get three boosters -if you shop at the right places- of your choice. unless you're like me, who wants certain cards from every set and who can't decide which packs to get, i'd say to go for separate packs."
3,Pokemon Deck Tin,"This is a good buy. Only buy it if you get a price under $9.99. The tin is useful to keep cards and decks in. The stickers are nice. The promo cards are weak basic pokemon (like Torchic). Since each type of deck tin is different, you could buy 2 or 3 if you liked it. The boosters are random, dont expect any one in particular. This is only a good purchase for someone with quite a lot of pokemon cards. The tin is very durable and will not break. Be careful with the cards, they will tear or bend if you are not."
5,Miss Melville is a Thinking Woman,I love the thought processes of Miss Melville. She has an interesting view of the world in general and society shenanigans. A sympathetic character with a sense of humor.
2,Not my cup of tea,"My mother really likes this author, for me this story just did not satisfy my tastes. I felt like the characters were to one sided without much meaning to them. They kind of felt sterotyped. If you want to really see characters in the south, that have alot of depth check out the movie Sordid Lives. The story did hold some suspense and some good sexual energy but the content would sometimes dip into areas where it didn't feel good. Now that would be okay but nothing seemed to get resolved or actually things that were dysfunctional, were not made apparent to the reader. It just was not my cup of tea, but my mom loved it. So I guess it just depends on the reader.Lisa Nary"
2,Disappointing,"I've been a fan of Fern Michaels for a couple of years now. Every time I see a book by her that I've not read, I buy it. This book was a huge disappointment. Most of the characters were not well developed. There was very little, if any at all, resolution to the story lines. What resolution there was, was very predictable. Definitely not the caliber of writing I'm used to seeing from Ms. Michaels. This book left me feeling empty and unsettled."
1,NO Star If Possible,"Too bad Amazon ratings weren't around in 1980, could have saved myself $7.99... This one should have stayed on the shelf. I am a fan of Ms. Michaels but this is terrible. I couldn't even finish this book...ugh!"
5,How wonderful it is to be reminded that imagination lives...,"Voyage of the Basset is a beautifully illustrated book in which each character is thoroughly explained by their role in the story. I think children and adults alike will love the fantasy journey of a family who has just suffered a loss and searches for their own individual needs through imagination...maybe...who knows, one day, a faery may tickle your ear"
5,Book of wonders,"This is a wonderful, magical book with illustrations that are nothing short of equisite. Our son gets lost in the pictures for hours on end, and that's before he even starts reading it! A good introduction to mythical characters, while the storyline is strong enough to carry itself."
3,Great toy- but came WRECKED,"it's not the actual toy that is the problem, to the contrary, my son was THRILLED when he opened the box. However, one of the watches didn't work and the other's antenna came right off. I was very upset especially as this seemed to be the toy of choice. On the upside, I wrote a letter of complaint to Discovery and they are sending me a brand new set for no extra charge (their products are indefinitely gauranteed)-i didn't even have to return the old ones. It seems that they have been getting a lot of the same complaints from other people because there were no questions asked."
3,walkie-talkies,I bought this for my 7 year old cousin. He loves it except for the earpiece. He has a difficult time getting it in and keeping it in his ear. It makes it quite frustrating for him to play with it. Maybe in a few years he'll grow into it.
4,Great Gift,I bought this as a birthday gift and it was a hit the day of the party! The kids ereally enjoyed spying on the adults.
1,yuck,Good idea. Failed in reality. Really low range. I mean you'd have to whisper into the watch to not be direclty heard by the other person when you were close enough to each other to use the thing. Broken and or lost within a week.
4,Good textbook for students and engineers,"This book was published in 1979 and is out of print now, but still has a high value as a textbook for students and engineers.It covers most of the important aspects of polymer processing. The book is compact, but not only fundamental but also advanced theoretical treatments are described as well. Explanations using dimensional analysis are very informative too.Personally, appendix B describing two-dimensional non-Newtonian melt flow theory in screw extruders is quite important."
5,Wow! What a wild ride!,"This exceptional recording is as far as you can get from commercial world music. Although impeccably recorded, there are no hip-hop overlays or added studio gloss. Turn it on and you're transported to a backstreet in Romania where a bunch of guys (three generations of master musicians to be precise) are singing and playing their hearts out.The music on the CD is sad and happy, silly and poignant, but always performed with great virtuosity.If you love the blues, bluegrass, soul, or klezmer you'll find much to love on this CD.PS: These are the guys featured in Latcho Drom."
5,music from the heart!,"old music gypsy music,the thing is that these people don't sing for the fans,for money,fame but because they feel like singing.they can make you cry or laugh.. .taraf de haiduci(original name)..taraf means band ,de means of and haiduci(like robin hood ..the outlaws who robbed the rich to help the poor)..some of the songs are sang in old romanian language...if you want to see something similar or almost similar..try fanfare ciocarlia(gypsy band for moldavia region) ,gheorghe zamfir(panflute ),goran bregovic(very popular),zdob and zdub(rock with gypsy influence from moldavia),maria tanase(hard to find)...esma redzepova(gypsie from macedonia),george dalaras etc!"
4,A Lot of Heart!!,"Truly a welcome change of pace. Energetic, Musical and with A Lot of Heart! Happy to have purchased this CD, can only wish for someday to be able to see them perform Live! While their Music sounds as old as time it also has the urgency of the modern, a great statement of music and quite original, what more can a person ask for, really. The Photo presented says a lot of Who they are, where they come from and it is all good. A fun and highly playable CD to own! 4 Stars!"
3,Good Read,"I liked this book, however it wasn't a ""wow"" read. I enjoyed True North much more. The characters in this book, just didn't seem to have the bond that they could have had."
4,Pretty Fun!,"This was the first time I had read a Brandt book, and I'm happy to say it won't be the last. This book mixed together romance, comedy, and even touched on some family values. While some of the comedic scenes are a bit far-fetched, on the whole, it was a very enjoyable book. The writing was fast-paced and entertaining, the storyline continued at a reasonable pace and there were a lot of supporting characters that were well drawn too. The only part I had trouble with was the end - there was a bit of an unexpected twist that really came out of nowhere and made the plot slightly less believable. Overall.. it's well worth your time!"
1,Terrible writing,"I hate to write negative reviews, but I really did think this book was terrible. Other people have left positive reviews, and I can't imagine why. The writing was terrible, the plot was utterly predictable, and the characters were completely one dimensional. Katya, the main character, was far too whiny, and she never did become likeable. Alex Sheridan, the knight in shining armor, was so over-the-top chivalrous/sucker for a damsel in distress it made me want to puke. The ending (before the utterly predictable part) was one of the most ridiculous and contrived things I've ever read. It came out of nowhere and did not fit the story.I suppose if you're looking for an unimpressive and cliche romantic read to pass a couple hours, this would do. I, however, do not recommend it to anybody and will probably not read anything else by this author."
5,a must listen...,"After finishing listening to Dick Summer's ""Night Connections"" I could not help wonder why this was so good. What is it that this guy has that allows him to convey our inner strengths, weaknessess, our trumphs and our foibles. For one, Dick Summer ""gets it."" He is a master of detail. Nothing goes unnoticed nor untold. He does not spare us any of the details of who we are, and what we may think. The funny thing is that not just anyone can masterfully ""truthspeak"" like Dick Summer does in ""Night Connections"". He says what most of us have thought, but may only have whispered to ourselves. As a long time fan of his, I must say that even if you are not, you should certainly do yourself the favor of getting ""Night Connections"" and hear for yourself, what you might have been thinking!Some of you will understand this, it certainly is ""mouth verses ear""!!"
5,I love this product,"I really love this product. I'm very health conscious and try many products and for snacking I tried this product a while ago and really enjoy it! I like knowing that I'm eating something very good for me and at the same time love the taste. I know that natural/healthy snacks sometimes can be bad tasting (I've had my share) but this product isn't one of them. Is it for everyone? Maybe not, but try it for yourself. I know I plan on purchasing this through Amazon for the savings."
4,Tasty,They taste quite good for something that contains veggies. My 2yr old son likes it. The package is too big so it will take us a while to finish all the bags.
1,Wrong title,"If you were a research student looking to gain some insight into Indian business culture then you would be as disappointed as I was after reading this book. The back cover of the book suggests ""Indian Business Culture addresses the cultural issues related to doing business in India"" but the reader is left wondering 'where'? From the tilte of the book you would expect discussion about cultural issues in Indian business however this is not the case. The book is obviously wrongly titled. Its deals with socio-political history of India. The author has carelessly title the book. It also contains some errors such as Nehru's death is claimed to have occured in 1962 whereas he actually died in 1964. There are occasional gramamtical and spelling errors too.This book isnt worth 19.00."
1,uncomfortable hand grips,I found the tool heavier than anticipated. The largest drawback for me was the lack of a cushioned handgrip. I returned the product.
3,Just okay,"For as much as I love my mini leatherman, I was shocked at how unimpressed I was with this. Don't get me wrong -- it's fine...basically sturdy with some handi-ish tools, but the pruners aren't terribly sharp, the mechanism regularly sticks, and it just doesn't have that all-around must-have awesomeness I was hoping for. I suppose it's handiest for someone who occasionally tinkers in the garden and needs a number of tools-in-one."
3,Great tool but it just broke,"Have had this tool for a couple of years. Worked well. Today,, however, trying, trimming dead branches off a bush, one of the cutting blades snapped off. They say they have a 25 yrs warranty but have no idea how to notify Leatherman. On to Internet search."
5,Garden tool,"great product for carrying around when working outside. Saves my lazy rear from walking back and forth to get knives, clippers etc."
5,Leatherman Garden Shears,"Bought this for my wife. She uses it for clipping her flowers,plants, stc. The unit is sharp and works well, she hasn't yet used the other items attached to the leatherman."
5,Great Product; Great Price,I own a number of Leathermans and find they are the best! Saw this product in This Old House Magazine and wanted one to hang on my belt when doing outside stuff. Beats running back and forth to house and shop for various tools. This one is made well and has all the necessary features.
4,Leatherman Hybrid Gardening Multitool,Great tool when I am working in the garden. The one tool replaces several tools. Only problem is when I use the weed blade it folds in too easily.
3,Different colors,I ordered this item expecting it would be colored yellow / black as indicated by the product photographs. This is important to me as a tool with high contrast colors is easier to see in the garden. The version I received was colored green / black. I've decided to return it. Otherwise it looks like a great tool.
3,it's a good buy at $33,"I wanted to buy one when it first came out, at full price. When the price dropped to ca $33 I bought one. I like the brand and their line of multitools. This is a great tool with one exception. The bypass pruner is not as robust as the new Genus model. With a hard to cut branch I found that the cutting blade twisted out of line and would not allow a cut. I guess this is the reason they decided to cut the price and clear them out. The new Genus looks to have a more robust cutting blade and probably won't twist out of line like this model. The other tools are just great and I would recommend this as an accessory tool and not your main pruner."
2,Uncomfortable,"I returned this tool. I found the handle very uncomfortable compared to the few hand pruners I already have; perhaps, my hands are just too small, or my grip is too weak. I also found the little tools very difficult to open. After thinking about it for a day, I realized that I would find it too annoying to bother with or to even pass it on to someone as a gift. I knew I'd prefer walking to my garage to get the tools that I liked working with."
3,Leatherman Hybrid Pruner,"I think what you pay some what dictates the usefulness of this product.It is in no way the quality of a pair of felco #7 but for general puttering around it is a good tool. I did have to slightly modify it, the prunner lock was sticking so I ground it down and all the blades needed touching up with a power strop.I think Leatherman could improve this tool by making replacable blades for the pruner and put a locking device on the accessory blades although with the handles in the closed position it would be hard to have a accident and hurt yourself and maybe a hand lens would be a nice addition to the onboard tools"
4,Great tool to have in the garden!,"The Leatherman Hybrid Gardening Multitool is one amazing tool! The shears are sharp and lock into place to allow the tool to be folded up. The multitools all work very well. The only two complaints with this tool are 1) The weeder does not lock into place, which means it will fold under while trying to use it. Not good for stubborn large weeds (No snide comments about why I allow my weeds to get so large! Everyone gets them... at least I tell myself that.) 2) You cannot open the side tools with gloves on. Maybe with latex gloves, but anything with any thickness and you'll have to take the glove off to be able to open the side tools.Overall, I really think this is a great product. Those complaints are minor and I highly recommend this product!"
5,Wonderful Movie!,We had this years ago on VHS and really missed seeing it. It's a movie that outlast changing times. It inspires creativity and can be watched over and over.
2,Disappointing,"It wasn't a bad movie, but had the potential of being great. The real theme of the movie seemed to be if you want to get ahead in life, you HAD to drink, like all the time. That is what the star did, and it didn't matter who she used, as long as she could get published. Some real mixed messaging, although it was done well. Donated my copy to the local library, not something I would want to watch again."
1,Defective Manufactured Product,"I loved this movie itself 5 stars! but . . .I rented a copy of it from Hollywood Video and could not get it to play in my DVD player. I ordered a new copy from CD Imports in California and it also was defective. I ordered a new copy from Movie Mars in North Carolina and it was defective. I returned it and got another new one from Movie Mars, it also was defective. My conclusion, an entire production run from the manufacturer is bad. Good Luck!~"
5,wonderfully pastoral film,I love the way this movie moves like you are reading a book.It is a great family movie showing a different time and verydifferent way of life. Really moving..
1,DVD didn't work,"We had this dvd delivered to an address in America, however, when we arrived there recently and tried to play it, it could not read or load the dvd. As we were returning to Australia three weeks later we felt if was pointless trying to have it replaced in that time. A waste of money! We received two other dvds at the same time and they worked."
5,Excellent and thought provoking,Beautiful movie with characters you want to know and spend time with even today.I was born in the south and miss the simple gentle lifestyle we see in this story
5,Great and true story,"We viewed this film many years ago and decided to add a copy to our DVD library. Unless a person is old enough and grew up in rural Florida, or I should say ""back woods"", you cannot fully appreciate the life of those early setters. This is one of the few and great depictions of real life in the deep Florida south. Tough people, honest people, helpful people, proud people, all attributes all can learn from."
4,cross creek,i did like but i want see it over again i would share with anybody at all watch one more time.
5,This book is excellent!! A must have for Agility lovers!,This book is perfect for those who are interested in learning more about Agility. It includes information that pretains to people just getting into the sport as well as tips for those who are already involved. It's detailed descriptions make it easy to follow even if one doesn't know the inside lingo. The exercises and training techniques worked wonders on my dog and I'm sure it will help you too!
1,Bad product,"The unit burned after less than a week of not continuos work, it was loaded at less than wat it is rated and it got burned! It obviously can' manage the load that it is rated for, i lost my money on this"
1,Cool device,This is really easy to install - you plug it in to the light cord. It works great for controlling the light for tiffany lamps.
1,Awful....Just awful,Don't even know where to begin.....hard to watch...it's a real cringefest. That creepy guy needs to pay people to sit thru this piece of crap. I will never get that time back
2,Not even a bad movie,"This movie is not realistic, really bad and very stupid. I am an avid bad movie and sleaze fan. This is not even a bad movie."
2,"MEh, not as bad as some have made it out.","Sometimes, I give low budget horror films a chance. I didn't care for this one, however it was by no means the worst I've seen. Still, I wouldn't recommend it."
2,"Not worst movie ever, but not very good.","I don't think its the worst ever as someone else wrote, but its not very good at all. not worst the couple of bucks. Beware"
5,Loved this Movie,this was a good film. I can't wait to see what they have coming next. I heard it will be a comedy. For Mr. Moulton's first film and the little money use it was great. Alot better than some movies i have seen on the big screen. Let's support the indie arts.
2,Unpleasant Heroine,"The ""puzzle lady"" is such an annoying, unlikeable character that I was completely turned off by this book. She's an alcoholic whose actions while drunk are supposed to be cute/funny -- browbeating the bartender who won't serve her anymore, fumbling around trying to make phone calls, staggering. Not to mention planning to drive while completely intoxicated. Who finds that sort of stuff humorous anymore?I enjoyed the small town atmosphere."
4,Fun Read,"I read a lot of these mass market mysteries not expecting much. This one was surprisingly good, and I will read more. Sherry constructs crossword puzzles for a living, but for many reasons she is a ""ghost"" constructor for her alcoholic aunt whose photo and name go on the puzzles. Already we have an unusual combination. All the characters in the book are unique, and the dialogue is good. The mystery itself has been done before, but I leave the discovery of that to the reader."
2,Had to drag myself though it....,I was intrigued with the beginning of this book but....soon it became a chore to finish. Sections dragged on with uninteresting parts that I skipped over. Characters were not developed in enough depth and ending did not pull things together as it could have. I probably won't give this author another try.
4,Funny and puzzling,This is a fun fast read but the mystery is not easy to solve . I find it tough to. Think of Cora Fenton without thinking of a chain smoking and drink guzzling. Maxine. It is worth the bucks. Buy it! Only four stars because this is not Shakespeare
2,Decent plot can't compensate for under-developed characters.,"I heartily agree with the reviewer who described this book as an ""outline"" for a great mystery. Mystery fans will find this book extremely formulaic and simplistic. The familiar and uninteresting characters were most disappointing to me: the little old lady who's not what she seems, the wise-cracking reporter, the bumbling but well-intentioned police chief, the intelligent young woman trying to put her past behind her, idiot teenagers. The fact that the little old woman is an alcoholic is not amusing or charming, though the author thinks it is.The plot is contrived to introduce the whole crossword puzzle theme to the series and to introduce all the characters to us. It holds up well enough, but can't compensate for the weak characters (including the killer).Readers looking for an interesting old lady would do well to try Heron Carvic's Miss Seeton series instead."
2,Pretty slow read,"I'm a huge murder mystery fan, so I was excited to read this book. The premise sounded good, but a few chapters into the book I wasn't hooked. I read all the way to the half way point of the book and just couldn't finish it.There were pages where nothing happened. But the most annoying part to me was how the author keeps referring to the main character and other characters by their entire names throughout the book (well, as much of it as I read) I think an introduction of the characters full names once is enough. I don't need to read how 'Cora Felton' did this and 'Cora Felton' did that. I think that is what turned me off the most. Every time I would read an entire name, I would mentally roll my eyes. I wouldn't recommend this book."
2,disappointing,"I love crossword puzzles and I love books, so when I saw this book I knew it was for me. What a disappointment! The characters were weak and their conversations went on and on without much being said. Cora, who is know as the puzzle lady, is a drunk and knows nothing about puzzles. I only finished the book because I truly wanted it to get better - it didn't. The concept of tying a crossword puzzle to a mystery is good, but it didn't work here."
1,"You should have ""responded"" during the trial","So after the trial is all over, and the jury has gone home, and O.J. is free, career bureaucrat Mr. Goldberg decides it is time cash in and write a book. To add insult to injury, his book is called, ""The Prosecution Responds."" Excuse me, but ""responds"" ? You had nearly one full year at trial; why didn't you make your case then when it would have counted? This defensive and somewhat silly book proves better than anything else why Vincent Bugliosi was right when he said the D.A.'s office was incompetent. The best O.J. Simpson criminal trial book remains ""Outrage"" by Vincent Bugliosi."
3,Doesn't live up to its title!,"""The Prosecution Responds"" is not about the prosecution ""responding"" to OJ's defense (as if the defense had something to prove anyway), but this book written by the assistant prosecutor in charge of scientific evidence is limited to HIS own knowledge of and dealings with the case.Instead of providing a narrative of the facts and trial, Goldberg tells us ""how the trial affected me."" It isn't until the middle of the book that he even mentions that OJ's blood was found at Nicole's townhome!! Further, his attitude is ""the prosecution did nothing wrong."" Once you read this book, you'll know that OJ did it, and ALSO that the prosecution blew the case by trying to prove things it didn't have to prove (such as ""OJ's a bad guy"").A MUCH better book on OJ's trial is Jeffrey Toobin's THE RUN OF HIS LIFE: THE PEOPLE V. O.J. SIMPSON."
1,"Boy, what some people will do to make a buck!!!!!",This book is the most boring thing to come down the pike since the trial itself. It is full of who cares facts and fiction. I certainly hope that these people handled the trial a lot better than they did writing this book. I find the worst thing here was that you actually had to pay for this book.
2,Prosecutors Failed,"From an educational standpoint famed attorney vincent bugliosi's book outrage is the best on anlaysing this case. For the civil case, Dan Petrocelli's book, Triump of Justice, shows how O.J. impeached himself during the trial with a mountain of lies; lies he contnues to spin 10 years later"
4,Awsome,"This book is great. There are not as many pictures as most people would like, but this book does have practicaly all the fish native to Florida. If you fish, Scuba Dive or even Snorkle this book is for you, every Floridian and Fisherman should have this book."
3,It's OK,"My only disappointment was the lack of color of the pictures. The renderings are simply black and white and not in color like the cover suggests. The volume is informative and would probably make a good ""pocket guide"" to keep in your tackle box."
2,Plenty to read but hard to find what your looking for.,"Using this book as a reference is a nightmare. As far as I can tell the index has no correlation between itself and the rest of the book. For example if your looking for info on null boxes the index shows you to a page about bezier curves. Or if your looking for information on page numbers, the actual text that deals with them falls between the pages stated in the index. Now if you can find the specific item your looking for there is usaually some good info there. However I find it more frustrating than helpful."
3,Example of Quark XPress's nature,"Also received a copy w/ the bad index, but it was replaced promptly, so hard to complain on that front.The book could be greatly improved w/ more discussion of how to avoid typographic difficulties in the first place, for example, noting that one should set the special command for not breaking a word after keying in a hard hyphen if one doesn't want compound words to be hyphenated (by most standards they shouldn't).It's also rather ironic that the author complains of the New York Times hyphenating ``doesn't'' after the ``s'' (on pg. 363) when there are multiple instances in the book of hyphenating ``didn't'' after the second ``d'', as well as at least one three word ``stack'' and a fair number of hyphenated words which fall on the bottom of right-hand pages."
2,"Wrong Index, an OK reference","So far I'm frustrated with this book because the index was incorrect, if this happens to you go to http://www.moo.com/books/rwqx5/qxbook/updates-rwqx6.html and download the new one or try [...]. For the price it would have been nice to get a CD tutorial. Also I needed help setting up bulleted items and eventually got what I needed looking up tabs and style sheets, but there wasn't much specific information within the book for what seemed like a basic task. I did like the general way it is written in a casual but professional style."
1,How about teaching us how to use it in the Real World,There is one tutorial in the over 900 pages of text. Not good for beginners!!!!
1,Too bulky to fit,My particular bicycle has chainstays that concave inward by design. This leaves not too much room when trying to mount the Vetta and trying to place the rigid sensor arms. I could not find a good position on top or bottom of the chainstay to allow clearance or near positioning of the sensor arms.
2,Disappointed,"I was really disappointed with this book. It is not a book about Jesus. It is a tirade against three authors who happen to disagree with him. (N.T. Wright). I was expecting more information on such things as the Jewish beliefs at the time of Christ. For example, he does mention about Jewish literature and such terms as ""Wisdom"", ""Torah"", ""Shekinah"" and ""Memra"". I was expecting him to explain more about how these terms are related to the Christian concept of Jesus as the Son of God. If you really want to know who Jesus was, this is not your book."
4,Faucet Review,"We purchased this faucet for our 5th wheel trailer dedicated water supply. It fits in well with the other faucet at the sink and works great. We like the type of handle, the kind that turns, not a push button. Easier to control the water flow. I would recommend this faucet for aesthetic as well as functional reasons."
1,Leaked Bad - No Instructions or Parts Diagram,"NOT RECOMMENDED. The item was as described but it leaked - badly. The nylon sleeve that holds the valve mechanism was not screwed in tightly. We tried several times to tighten it and it still leaked. We finally had to crank it down really hard to get it to seal. Even so, it doesn't turn the water all the way off in the down position. Off is about a 1/4 turn back. WTF? It may be missing an o-ring or gasket and that is why it leaks and doesn't work properly, but how would I know? It came with no instructions or parts diagram."
3,Oops. Didn't understand gap vs. no gap,"It's probably a fine faucet, but I didn't realize there was a difference between air gap and normal faucets. Mine needed the (more expensive) air gap version (with three connections), so I had to return this. Just make sure this is what you need."
4,A very nice piece!,"This water faucet is connected to our RO and replaced a Culligan faucet which was made out of plastic. This goes very well with our new stone counter top. It's very east to install. The knob is very sturdy and turns very well. Although at times when we have not used the faucet for hours, I see a globe of water at the tip of the faucet ready to drip. It does not drip at all but I believe that this happens only because the faucet I replaced has an airgap. Otherwise, great addition to the kitchen!"
4,water faucet,It is fine. It looks good. One thing it doesn't have is a way to just push and hold for one handed glass filling.
1,Mockery of Justice,"This was the third book I had read on the murder of Marilyn Sheppard...I had always felt that Sam Sheppard was innocent until I read my fourth book on this murder - Dr. Sam Sheppard on Trial: The Prosecutors and the Marilyn Sheppard Murder by Jack P. DeSario [Hardcover]...if you're really interested in this case and want the truth, then read Dr. Sam Sheppard on Trial...the FBI testimony about murder classification will blow you away. The characteristics of a domestic violence murder were ALL present in this murder. The book gives a little trial testimony from all three trials - this book is about the civil trial in 2000 brought against the state of Ohio by the son. My sympathies to him because he now knows the truth about his father."
1,"Good Story, Poor Writing","I thought the writing in ""The Wrong Man"" was dull. Then I read this book...some of the worst writing I've seen in recent years. Cynthia Cooper manages to take a compelling story and make it a struggle to read with her awkward, turgid style.Skip this book. There are much better books on this case available."
4,DETAILED REVIEW OF SAM SHEPPERD MURDER CASE,I recommend this book for anyone who wants to learn all the circumstances surrounding the Sam Shepperd Murder case. Still leaves open who really killed Marilyn Shepperd
3,Pretty Good Account...,"of a fascinating case from the 1950's. The authors go over a lot of ground that has already been covered. But they also present compelling evidence pointing to a man that heretofore was only on the sidelines in this investigation. The book goes into deep detail about this new suspect and produces almost incontrivertible evidence that he was indeed Marilyn Sheppard's killer.Since the crime happened in the mid' 1950's there was not the DNA and Forensic capabilities there are now. Had there been, Sam Sheppard would very probably not have spent better than ten years in prison for a crime he didn't commit. The book details the intriguing tragedy of the whole of Sheppard's life. If you follow the case, there is not a lot here you don't already know, but the best part is the revelation of the almost certain perpetrator."
2,Mockery of Logic,This book is a poor attempt by Sam Junior to show his father did not kill his mother so he can sue the State of Ohio.
1,Doesn't deserve ONE star if any,Clock display different from projection. Projection angle horrible. Projection very awkward and hardly legible. Unit was purchased for $14.99 & GPX asked me to send unit to them along with $15.00 for a replacement. Would end up paying more than product is worth for warranty replacement.
3,**Amazing Gracie**,"At first I found this book interesting. As I kept reading I found the book sort of sad. I think the mom is trying to hard to be young. I feel bad for Gracie though, it must be annoying to have a dork for a dad. Also, I think the book is a little to dramatic. Overall the book wasn't the type of genre I enjoy."
3,"Ok, if you don't have the same ""country gold"" soundtracks on another edition","I found out that when I bought the song disc (Country Gold), then bought the Party Pac collection, I realized that the same songs were available in the Party Pack. Just buying the ""Partry Pack"" would be the best way to go."
4,"AeroBed Inflatable Bed, Full",The reason that I give 4 stars insted of 5 is there is a little leakage two out of three AeroBed Inflatable Bed when you step on the area of closer cover. One of those no any leakage no matter where you step on.
1,arrived with holes,"I've always been a happy customer of Amazon, until now. When I received this bed, not only did it take 3 weeks for delivery, but it also arrived WITHOUT the motor, the carrying case, or the cover. The only thing that came was the mattress, and that had large gaping rips with footprints and mold on it. It also emitted a terrible odour. Looked like it went through a war or something.When I called amazon about this, they were willing to send me over a new bed, but of course the delux model was not to be in stock for 2 more months. So they made me downgrade to the regular model but still paying the same price. Of course I didn't go down without fighting a significant amount and yelled at several managers. But it seems like making their customers happy isn't that important. So to sum it up, Amazon screwed me over by making me pay the same amount of money for a downgrade w/ finally getting a bed in 4 WEEKS!!! since I ordered it. [...]. If I didn't desperately need a bed asap, [...]"
3,The old version is more comfortable,"Having had the old version (the one w/ the pump on the outside) for 8 years, I finally decided to buy the new one that had the pump inside the mattress.The new pump being inside made it so much easier to fold the mattress after use, and to put sheets on it. It has a better gasket that closes with a audible snap. However, the PVC material used to make the matress feels thinner and lighter in weight than the older version. The new mattress is also 1 inch shorter off the floor than the older version.The older one seems sturdier than the newer one. My old one has been used as a box spring, out camping, in dorms and cabins for over 8 yrs.They do not patch well. My older one finally got a pinpoint puncture that has been impossible to patch, hence the purchase of the new one.Conclusion: I wish they still made the older one w/ the original dimensions and original PVC material and added improvements to the gasket and the pump placement."
5,I Like It,"I wasn't so sure if I'd like my AeroBed. I ordered it because I needed an additional bed at home and I didn't have space for another bed, and I didn't want to get a sleeper sofa.I expected some fairly cheap manufacture and inflated [pardon the pun] claims about its useabilty. Well, I was surprised.The unit is very well made. They've got that down. The seams are sturdy, the material is thick, and the pump and valve are first-rate. What more could you ask?I'm now a fan of the bed. I'd recommend it. Aero also sells a bunch of accessories on their website such as collapsible bed stands to get the inflatable mattress off the floor; inflatable pillows, etc.I think you'll be pleased that it's not cheaply made. I was."
2,"leaky, leaky and a bit of a disappointment","I bought the bed after reading raving reviews. The bed was comfortable and I had great nights of sleep until last week. It leaked and I kept waking up feeling like I was in a rescue rubber raft. Now I'm back on my old futon until I can buy a real mattress. I was told that I could use the Aerobed as a normal mattress - not true. I spent a lot of money on something that is now sitting in my closet. For occasional use, I think this product is great but realistically, it's not a very good buy. Had I not experienced the air leaking, I would be adding more stars to the product but it only deserves a two star rating."
2,Short on longevity!,"The product was great for the first two to three months, however like many before noted holes started to pop up from no where and I was extremely careful with the product. I tried an assortment of glues to repair the product however a spawn of new holes would emerge within days. This a great product for short term usage not long term. I tried using it for my bed for one year, it lasted seven months with an assortment of botched repair attempts."
2,Good while it lasted,"I thought I was the only one with a leaking problem until I read the other reviews. Agree on all points that the bed is great for guests, but like others, mine started to spring leaks and I had to throw it away after having it for a little over a year."
2,My bed (bad),"I purchased my 2 months ago. I guess, it was design for occasional use only.Since I am traveling consultant, who has to stay in different places (read rent apartments), I decided to buy one. 2 month later (it means 60 uses later) it started deflating. Yes it is great, if you will use it 5-6 times a year, it will last you 10 years."
1,Don't buy it.,"If you use air mattress to sleep on DO NOT buy an AeroBed mattress. They are not worth the money you pay for them. It does not matter what model you purchased. I have purchased both the Premier and Classic. Both models created the same air pockets or bubble within 3 months of use. This product is not like the old ones, when their name meant something.Bewared that returned product does not start with date 1 on the warranty. If continues from the original date of purchase on your receipt, not when company sends out the replacement product. Do NOT buy it, you will regret it, buy a Coleman it is much better product."
2,Less than 8 hrs sleep,"My main concern on the mattress I bought from Amazon.com is the slow leak it had/has. I can only get about 4 1/2 hrs of sleep before the matress changes from firm to flat. This of course wakes me and I have to refill it (push the button - producing a vacumn cleaner sound) to get it back to firm and return to sleep. I don't always get back to sleep for a couple of hours. I never had this problem (leaks) with my waterbed, and it lasted 25 years before that matress got a leak. One last thing, it's short. I'm 5'8"" and seem to find either my head or feet always hanging out the top or bottom of the 60"" length."
2,Don't use on a regular basis...,"This bed was quite comfortable...so much so that I tried sleeping on it every night when I was experiencing a back problem. But, the problem them became that it would leak. I thought maybe the first one I purchased just had a hole. WRONG! Went through 4 others and they all had the identical problem. Even tried a larger size (QUEEN) and it went flat in a matter of days. If you plan to use it for occasional guests, you'll probably find it cheaper than buying a bed. Just don't count on it for long periods of time (like a summer break for a kid)."
2,"great for short-term, not a good idea for long-term use","If you're going to be using this only for infrequent guests, this is a great product, truly is. Very comfortable to sleep on (surprisingly so), and fills up amazingly fast. (Heavy to carry from house to house, though, so I'd recommend it being a stationery, in house-thing.)If you're going to be using this full-time, I don't recommend it. I used it for 3 months while I was in between beds (just moved to a new city, and didn't have time to get furniture right away), and at the 3rd month holes started to sprout, within the seams. Meaning, not holes from something accidentally poking it (I was very careful with it), but the seams themselves started to split open. Which means I spent $150 for a bed that only lasted 3 months. Not cool."
1,Poor warranty- lasted 3 months.,"I bought one several years ago, and it started leaking in 3 months. It was under warranty, so I figured they'd have me ship it back. Much to my surprise their warranty proceedure consisted of shipping me one part at a time with repair instructions. After two shipments failed to correct the leak, I got a $20 coleman at my local discount store and that mattress has lasted years. This was a waste of around $150, and much hold time on the customer service line."
5,EL MEJOR REGALO,"Es una preciosidad de libro para niños. Si tiene que hacer un regalo a una criatura, que actualmente, es tan difícil, pues tienen de todo...le recomiendo este libro con el que rírán mucho y pueden iluminarlo.Muy buena idea."
4,Nice unit,"Nice product for the price. Easy installation,quick set up, accurate information. the only con is that the unit has many features and the manual doesn't provide enough detail on them."
5,UNDERESTIMATED ART,"This recording is very similar to the Art Pepper Quartet, Tampa Masters. The Marty Paich Quartet featuring Art Pepper is also a Tampa Masters recording of the same period (1956). The personal are Pepper, Paich, Buddy Clark, bass and Frank Capp, drums. Marty Paich is a fine composer and player but this is clearly Pepper's album. Combine this recording with the aforementioned Art Pepper Quartet (Tampa} and you have a flawless, flowing, horn of plenty two sets of music. There is such beauty in his music and unfortunately not in other aspects of his being. These sets exemplify the artist he was."
2,Nice when it worked. Some snagging.,"Failed me on the second USE. Snagged hair a little. Biggest complaint is that instead of being able to leave it on 180 and get nice results like the first use, I had to turn it up to between 250 and 320. At 180 it didn't even feel like it was really on, more like after you've turned it off and it's cooling down.It also doesn't open wide enough for the blind straightening I have to do at the back of my head. But that may have just taken some getting used to.I'm leaning toward really liking the Remington Shine Therapy right now. Still up in the air.I'm shipping the Solia back to Folica tomorrow for refund--no replacement, no repair. At my expense, of course :(Ideally, I won't have to escalate with my credit card issuer."
3,Not so good on flat thin hair.,"I was anxious to get my flat iron so I could make my flat thin hair look like others in my peer group (volume and curl). I don't know if it's the inability of the flat iron, or if my hair is just impossible."
1,DISAPPOINTED,"My name is graciel and I'm of latin american and african descend. I bought my solia tourmaline ceramic ion flat iron july 2009. Since then I've used it almost twice every week. I didn't use it every day.It is a fantastic product if you have very curly hair like me. I used to relax my hair to get it straigt, but I stopped doing so, sometime before I bought my flat iron. It did a great job, until a couple of weeks a go I accidentally dropped it while I was straigtning my hair. It immediately turned of. After a while I could turn it back on without a problem. Then after a week or so it just turned of while I was using it and I haven't been able to get it to work again since then. I'm so disappointed because it realy did get my hair straight and I only had it for 5 months. The worst part is that the warranty does not apply if you buy it from amazone."
3,Not so wonderful,The hair dryer does not have enough rows of bristles to hold the hair while drying and I ended up with some frizz and flyaways. I was used to Gold and Hot products but they keep breaking. I do like how this one has a hinged vent cover.
5,The best I've used,"I love this flat iron. I brought it to Europe w/me and it , unfortunately, ""melted"" - even though I had the proper transformer and converter. Flat irons just require too much heat, so you need a dual voltage. I had to buy another flat iron while away. As soon as I returned home, I bought another Solia Tourmaline Ceramic Ion Flat Iron (1""). It really makes my hair feel and look healthy, in spite of the heat applied almost daily."
4,Constructive Critique,"I'm giving this straight iron a four star review, because as a straight iron it works great, however, the advertisement claims frizz free hair, which is not exactly true. This iron does straighten a lot faster and easier than my old conair, and it does last til I wash my hair again (or it rains and gets wet), but I still get the fluff strands all over, and my hair has been splitting a lot more quickly now while using this product.Overall, great straightener, but don't expect to get completely smooth hair without a straightening balm or mousse or other heat styling product. Personally, I use the Fructis Smoothing Milk, and I get that silky smooth look and feel."
5,Love it love it love it,"I bought this iron as an impulse purchase one late night a year and a half ago. I wanted to get the Sedu Revolution but couldn't justify paying over $100 for a 1 inch flat iron when my Chi still worked well. So I bought this (cheaper and smaller) iron instead.I'm black with a relaxer. I also stretch my relaxer to over 12 plus weeks. As you can imagine, that's A LOT of new growth. I rollerset my hair every week, then will hit the roots only with my Solia. It leaves my roots straight and very shiny.This little irons works just as well my Chi Turbo (without the problem of the felt wearing off and it being hot to the touch) and better than my maxiglide (which was a waste of money), my t3 wet or dry (even more of waste of money, i gave it away) and my FHI Platform (which is probably my second favorite iron after the Solia).Definitely recommend."
2,Not worht the money,"I tried this straightener twice and do not like it at all!! I liked that the straightener had a temp dial and didn't expect t have to use it on high all the time, but I do. The outside of the straightener heats up pretty much the same as the plates on the inside which means the only place to hold it is on the handle. Most other straighteners have an area you can put your fingers on the open end so you are able to use two hands, this one you can't with out being burned. It is also impossible to get right down to the roots of the hair because the plates are so close to the edge of the straightener that I end up burning my head. I am very disappointed for the price and expected a lot more because it was rated so god online."
2,It works if it doesnt fall apart,"I loved my hair iron but after a few months the ceramic plates started to come off. Ive had this less than a year and cant even use it because it snags and pulls several hairs every time. OUCH!!! Maybe its defective, but I feel like a product of this quality shouldnt fall apart in less than a year. I only use it once a week."
5,Excellent!,"I strongly recommend this hot iron. I currently live in a very humid country and have curly hair, and this flat iron leaves my hair super straight for up to 3 days. It is better than using a blow dryer and much quicker. It heats up quickly and is very easy to use. I love it."
2,Great until it broke,"Mine worked really, really well... until its circuits cooked themselves.I'm not sure if this was just one of those times where you get a ""bad apple"" from what is normally a good product, but I sure as hell didn't buy a second one to find out."
2,If you like Dull unfinished looking hair,I have been using FHI Heat irons for a couple of years now. FHI Heat irons seal my ends and make my hair supershiny and sleek. The compliments never end when I use these. I'm an African American with a nice grade of thick medium length hair. People think it's a wig sometimes after I straighten it.I heard good things about the Solia irons and decided to try something different. The Solia hair irons make my hair dull and don't seal the ends like the FHI irons seem to do. They make my hair look unfinished. My ends look frayed and raggedy and the shine isn't there. I am returning this product asap.
5,"AMAZING, and I'm not just saying that.","I bought this straightner over 6 years ago. It still works the same and gets just as hot as the day I first bought it. All my friends have gotten the straightner because it had a dramatic effect of my hair. It not only straightens it, it really does repair it. I have never seen my hair so shinny and silky before. PLEASE get his straightner. I HIGHLY recommened it to everyone. It is great. I will be buying these for my Christmas gifts this year!"
5,Great product for decent price,"I haven't bought this particular brand before, but I'm glad I did! The adjustable heat setting makes a big difference. My hair is pretty fine and so it sometimes gets damaged by the extreme heat of other straighteners. I've been keeping it about 325 degrees and I've noticed that my hair isn't drying out so bad. The ceramic / tourmaline plates also help keep my hair healthy. I would definitely recommend this product."
5,Excellent,Just made this purchase about a month ago. It's the best straightener I've purchased. It really does not damage my hair as does the cheaper brands. I would highly recommend this product to others. :)
3,"never get hot, not for humidity!","i have wavy, dry, thick hair that goes about half way down my back and chest. i bought this iron because of it's awesome review on [...] but i wish i read into other reviews first. i don't like this iron because i feel like it never gets hot. it goes up to 420 degrees, i believe, but i feel like the plates are never hot and i need to go over certain parts of my hair four or five times. also, in a couple hours my hair starts to get wavy again. i would never recommend this iron to someone i hated! but.. the iron makes AWESOME barrel curls, which is why i give it three stars."
3,"Works great, but only worked for 9 months","I'm hoping the 1 year warranty covers it, I really like it but am very irritated I have to send it back to the company!"
4,Very good,"I bought this solia 2 weeks ago, it works amazing, not only straight my hair also leave it soft...i love it!!!!!!"
4,LOVE IT!,"I love this straightener. I only have to do one pass on each section of hair. My hair is straight all day even in high humidity. No snagging, no pulling my hair, it is very smooth. The reason for 4 stars is I was a little suprised at how high I had to turn up the temperature so that this would straighten my hair in one pass. I have very fine, shoulder length hair. I just use a thermal protection spray so that my hair is not damaged by the high heat setting."
4,Solia Tourmaline Ceramic Ion Flat Iron,"I've had this flat iron for over 2 years and I LOVE IT! It was worth every penny! It works well without making my hair singed or frizzy, it glides through smoothly and I can still use the second setting on my hair (it's naturally thick and curly) and it still does the job well!"
5,leap of faith,"This is my second flat iron, a replacement to a conair 3/4 $15 dollar iron. If you are worried about the cost, DON'T be; it's worth it. My hair has never looked better, and the best part is that it lasts until I wash my hair again. I no longer have to fear drizzle and humidity and rain or going to sleep and waking up with a mess on my head. I don't feel like I'm damaging my hair like with my old conair, and the results are far better. There is no fuzziness to my hair when I'm finished and all it takes is one swipe. When I was using the conair, I would have to go over it with my curling iron and the results would last, if I was lucky and the weather was perfect, two days. And my ends would also looked fried. With my Solia, my hair is straight, light, and shiny and it doesn't frizz or fuzz up. And my ends have yet to looked fried while using the Solia. ^_^ My hair also looks healthier than it ever has before."
1,Poor Quality,This product appears to be of very low quality. The threaded area has nicks that could damage the threads on the engine. I will not use this on my car. The rest of the plug gives the impression that it is either reconditioned or just poorly manufactured.
3,Johnny Winter Legendary Licks Slide Guitar DVD,My only complaint is that the DVD really only works on the TV DVD player and not my PC. It runs on the PC but you can't get jump to different chapters. I wish that this fact was advertised on all DVDs.
3,Heidi's back!,"I was a fan of Barbara Wersba's previous 2 Heidi books ""Just be Gorgeous"" and ""Wonderful Me"" and when I heard there was a third, well, wild horses couldn't drag me away. I got it tonight and read it in 2 and a half hours. That being said, this is probably the weakest effort in the series. The plot seems to gather steam in the last third, then ends to abruptly. Not enough happens in this book, yet Wersba's writing is so compulsively readable you don't even mind. One thing that really bothered me about the book is that clearly Heidi is a lesbian. It's just so clear in the description of her, and yet she falls in love and begins a sexual relationship with a boy. I just wish Wersba had gone all out and made her a lesbian; it would have been a bit more believable. If you are gong to read this, you should read her previous two books about Heidi first."
5,The best holliday memory of 2001,"I was on a holiday in Spain the past year 2001, when i bought this cd. The track ""Yo quiero bailar"" is my favourite track, but the rest is also great. The whole cd is full of uptempo sunny summertracks. You can best listen to this cd lying on your bed, thinking of the summer... BUY THIS ONE! You will not feel sorry!"
3,Avoid,"Most likley a class will require the purchase of this book. Otherwise, avoid the book in favor of other choices. The book teaches in the form of text blocks and requires much of the homework questions in essentially essay/written form. Lack of visuals makes the book terrible for a visual learner. Even the professor would admit some of the reference tables are unessesarily detailed and confusing. However, the depth of explaination and the written answers will allow you to really get what's going on with the equations once you know what the heck you are doing in the first place..."
3,Disappointing,"I love organ music, and I love to hear these songs played on an organ. While some of the performances on this CD are better than others, many are poor: the timing is off and they seem to be rushing to get done. I'm dissapointed with this CD, and am still looking for something better."
4,A Comprehensive Text on Marketing Research,Covers all the essential topics of marketing research. The questions at the end of each chapter were very useful to me as a student in a marketing diploma course. More tailored for the Asian readers.
5,Bathroom Reader of Catholic Enclyopedias,"This is a lovely book of Catholic Factoids - a perfect bathroom reader filled with stories of Saints and Catholic tradition.It is comical, respectful and yet unoffensive guide for anyone interested in the traditions of the Catholic Religion.The only thing missing in this book is the Catholic Guilt..."
5,Saints and Sacraments Crash Course,"I thoroughly enjoyed this book. It's slightly irreverent but entirely hilarious. Readers will learn a lot about the saints and their feastdays with the added bonus of tidbits that most people have not heard about. It also has summaries of the seven sacraments. I recommend this book to Catholics as light reading. I suggest other faiths should read something else like ""Why do Catholics do That?"" before picking up this one, so they don't get the impression that Catholics are nuts. Well, some of us are, but we won't admit it!"
5,Hilarious and informative,"Who says Catholics don't know how to have fun? This book thoroughly debunks that idea by taking readers through the year, highlighting saints and feast days with trivia, recipes, and short essays on church practice and sacraments. At time irreverent but always in the orthodox tradition, this is a great book for any Catholic library."
4,The Bad Catholics Guide to Good Living,"Thought it would be more entertaining. Good and Solid from a Catholic perspective. Fairly enjoyable, but well, somethings missing. Buy it, maybe my sense of humor is rusty."
2,Misled by First Things Review,"I bought this book having been influenced by the brief review of it in First Things, a review that I took to suggest that the humor of the book was in some sense akin to Chesterton's. Chesterton's humor, of course, is both very funny, but also, and even more, the bloom of brilliant insight. I just don't find this book insightful. While some will find the ""frequently sophomoric"" (First Things' word) humor of ""The Bad Catholic's Guide to Good Living"" to be amusing, I really don't. This book is not a pint of Chestertonian ale; it's more like a 7-11 Big Gulp of syrupy soda."
2,Disappointed,"I bought this book as a gift for our son. After it arrived, I looked through it and was very disappointed. I was sorry I bought it. I didn't find it funny or meaningful. Some pages were embarrassing. My husband thinks it's hilarious and is reading it. Needless to say, I purchased another book to give to our son."
2,The Teng Dynasty Stumbles....,"There's nothing particularly wrong with Vienna Teng's third album, but that's not to say that there's anything special about it either. What made here an instant hit, in my mind, is what she has abandoned to produce this sleek release: her scaled-down, straightforward, home-made style of music that managed to tug at your heartstrings.""Dreaming Through The Noise"" is well-produced, melodic and full of wonderful guest musicians who take up quite a bit of the total content of the CD. Vienna's magic lies in her extraordinary voice and honest lyrics. She is ironically surrounded by too much Noise in this album for her true gifts to come forward, and she ends up coming across like any number of other singers out there: catchy and unobtrusive but ultimately bland.No disrespect is meant to her in this, as she is a brilliant singer with a great story, but my feeling is that this release isn't her best work."
4,Versatile talent and classy style,"I enjoy the breadth of music Vienna has to offer, along with her versatile voice and compositional skills. Each new CD shows more of her talents."
4,awesome!!,"fast shipping, item arrived in great condition and is excellent quality!! would buy again from this seller."
2,"Nice looking, decent material, but uncomfortable.","The elastic on these is a bit tight for their size, although not quite so bad that it along makes them uncomfortable. The issue is the label that is stitched in the back. The stitchings are extremely aggressive and rub against my backside when walking, making for quite an uncomfortable feeling. It reminds me of wearing clothes where the tags are not fully removed. I'd cut the label off, but I'm not convinced that would solve the problem since it is the stitching itself and not the label."
2,Intimo Silk Boxers,"Boxers are packaged nicely; however, the solid blue pair has a slit in the side seam where they were never stitched."
5,One of the dog's favorite outdoor toys,I had one of these from a toy store and it wore out after several years outside. This is a replacement for it and it's one of my dog's favorite toys. I'm glad it's still being made.
2,Soft not Tough,"My female dobie mix dog needs 3 of these big red balls for our kickball game. Our OLD balls have held up well, considering the abuse they get. I ordered a new ball to replace the worst ball. The NEW ball lasted less than an hour. Another of my dogs, a 10-yr old Doberman, chewed out the squeaker too quickly for me to even notice what she was doing until it was too late. The seller was unsympathetic. So enjoy kickball with your dogs but don't let the ball out of your sight for a moment! The old balls are tough as leather but the new balls are just soft."
2,EH? WELL...I GOT IT ANYWAYS...,"GRANTED, THERE ARE SOME REALLY KOOL TRAX HERE, BUT FOR THE MOST PART, I SHOULDA SPENT THE MONEY ON A DIETIPHOBIA CD!! OR ANYTHING FROM BOLNDE VINYL REALLY!! WHAT A LABEL!! IT'S KOOL TO HEAR SOMETHINGS ON HERE I NEVER KNEW WERE, BUT AT THIS POINT, EVEN IF I DUG THE GROUPS, MOST OF THEM ARE GONE. TRAGIC. WHY DOES GOOD MUSIC ALWAYS DISAPPEAR? OH HOW I LONG FOR THE DAYS OF UNDERMIDNIGHT, GENERATION AND X-PROPAGATION!! BRING BACK THE MACHINES!!"
2,Didn't work!,I didn't see much of a change in the fleas on my dog while using this product! Don't think it helped at all!
1,Not a reliable source of information,"Not only depth was sacrificed in this book, as the Editorial Review correctly pointed out. I would expect a ""historical"" book to stick to the history better than this one. It is undoubtedly good for people who used to learn history from movies like ""Haunt for the Red October"" or ""Enigma"" and so like. Looks like another typical American production with sometimes bizzare selection of events, good graphics though. Do not do this mistake as I did."
3,A good starting point.,"This book is a good place to start research, but only if the reader uses it as an initial reference. Readers would be wise to cross-check facts, since in a few moments I found errors in the early eras: the Hyksos in Egypt at the wrong time, Naram-sin of Agade ruling at the wrong time, Babylon mentioned before it ever was founded, Eqypt ruling Crete.Later eras may have more accurate information.The book is a good over-all view for one who wants the whole picture before going deeper into any particular time or place.For general knowledge of contemporaneous events Jacquetta Hawkes' book has yet to be equaled."
4,"Not comprehensive, but a beautiful overview","DK makes gorgeous books, and this is no exception. Other books are more comprehensive, but there's a different reason for adding this one to your collection. It has an embarrassing wealth of visuals, the timelines let you see what was happening simultaneously in different parts of the world, and the concordance provides a quick look-up for any topic (person, place, thing, concept). In the concordance, China, for example, has a brief geographic & political overview, a chronology (all in one place rather than spaced throughout time as in the first section), and lists of rulers. Page references are given to lead the reader to additional information.This book would make an excellent resource for world history teachers and students."
5,A cross-cultural journey through human history,"Timelines Of World History packs a cross-cultural journey through human history in a timeline format which excels in color photos and drawings. High school through adult readers will find Timelines Of World History to be a delightfully easy way to absorb world history, as the colorful timelines offer the opportunity to easily compare cultural developments around the world at different points in time. An outstanding presentation."
4,Fast review,"Nuclear Energy: Principles, Practices, and ProspectsThis book offers a wide coverage of both, theory and application, of nuclear energy. Nuclear energy is treated as source of electrical power and as a weapon, with obvious distinction. The physical theory is easy but complete and serves as a good starting point to a wide set of applications that include electrical power production (with a good comparison of costs between nuclear and oter ways of producing electricity), research and weapon principles. All these subjects are explored rather deeply, along with their ramifications.It is a good book, worth his prize."
3,Not my favorite Face Wash,"I have normal/combination skin that's prone to breakouts when I'm over or under moisturized. So far this product has not prompted any breakouts but it does leave my skin feeling a little tight and dry; although after I apply moisturizer my face feels really soft and smooth. I don't like the way it leaves my skin feeling sticky, almost like its rinsed away too cleanly, or the fragrance. There aren't any harsh chemicals in it which, I guess, is why its not full of parfums and fragrances, and it doesn't smell bad but it reminds me of my mom's old cold cream. I have only been using it for a week, but so far I haven't seen any drastic improvents in my skin's tone or texture. I'll keep using it until I find something better."
1,Testworks Calculus: Test and Practice Software,"I would like to return and get money back with the following reasons:1) Very old version software which is not compatible with current Adobe 8 or 9 (only works with Adobe 4). After accepting the Adobe 4 installation, I was able to run this program. However, my computer has a problem with Adobe file reading in emails and opening other files.2) The description wasn't matched with the software, Student Edition. The software program was for EDITING calculus test cases for students. This book was about few pages of listing the calcus chapters content with a CD which never had been opened.The software didn't contain the test cases for students. It was for creating/editing test cases by using the software program. Please advise if Amazon allows returning. If then, what is the procedure like?"
2,Looks different than picture,"We do not like the chairs... the color of the metal in the picture appears to be brown but it is black when we received them. The texture of the metal feels very cheap, there's a texture that's meant to resemble wrought iron but it is clearly not. Wanted to return them but the shipping back is on us plus there's a 20% restocking fee, so it doesn't really make sense. If you're looking for a cheap set of chairs they are not the worst but not great."
2,just comfy,The chair is comfortable.not al wrought irontop heavy - tilts back easyplastic caps for bottom of legs wears out quickly leaving metal circles etched in my hardwood floors
3,In the eyes of this reviewer . . .,". . . it is possible for a travel guide to contain too MUCH information!In my view, this book falls into this category. A cursory glance at my reviews will show that I've reviewed quite a few travel guides published by various companies, and have been both positive and negative. As ""Fodor's"" is certainly a leader in the field, and since this is a part of the world I would very much like to explore, I chose to review it.And felt overwhelmed.The book is physically beautiful and some of the photos are downright stunning. But the information was SO thorough and SO complete that for someone new to the area (like I would be) it might well be information overload. At times, I felt as though I was reading a Triple A Tour Book.For the experienced traveler, who might want to know about some of the more obscure restaurants, clubs, and destinations, this book would work well. But I would recommend another option for a ""newbie""."
4,Made me want to visit additional places,This is a very attractive book with lots of full color pictures - I found myself wanting to add more towns to my itinerary as I browsed through it. The few areas that I am familiar with had good recommendations so I would trust the rest. I did think that the maps could be improved. Also I'd appreciate a little more coverage of different neighborhoods in the larger cities. Even the neighborhoods that were mentioned were not necessarily shown on their maps. Perhaps I'd need a city guide for that level of detail.
2,Fine.,"We are planning a road trip through the Pacific Northwest this summer, so I was excited to see this book come up on my options for reviewing. However, the attractions/sights information offers no more (if not less) than one might find in the AAA guide that comes free with membership. The hotel and restaurant information is more complete, but again, nothing more than I can already get for free on yelp or other online outlets. I think putting the money towards a AAA membership and getting their guide might be a better decision."
3,Covers a little of a lot,"Each town/city of the Pacific Northwest gets it's 2 second of fame in this travel guide. We do appreciate it, being new to the area, but the depth applied to any given area is slight."
4,Great information on a large area,"This book has a lot of good detail about a large area that covers Oregon, Washington State and Vancouver BC. It highlights all of the major attractions (Portland, Seattle, Vancouver, parks and mountains, etc.) and probably overlooks some. But for what it covers, it does it well. We have been planning a trip on the Amtrak Empire Builder line through the Rockies and to spend a couple weeks exploring the Pacific Northwest. This book gives us a great starting point for information on what to do and see when we rent a vehicle to explore the areas. Good photos and it seems like up-to-date and timely information. Another well done travel book by Fodor's."
5,This Book is Helping Me Plan a Very Exciting Trip,"Though I live in the San Francisco Bay area, I've never been to Oregon or Washington and I've never been to Canada. This summer a couple friends and I plan to drive up 101 all the way to Port Angeles in Washington and then around to Olympia, then onto Seattle and up to Vancouver, where we plan on visiting a girlfriend we haven't seen since college. So this book really is going to be handy for me.I've already read through most of this book and for me it's like reading like an exciting novel. I know it's only because I'm going to be spending a month on the road, going to many of the places between these pages and because even though it's months off, I'm as excited about this trip as I've ever been about anything.This book is well written by people who know the places they're talking about. I'm enjoying it very much and I'm very pleased to be giving it five stars."
2,Not a quality product,"Yes, arrived on time, but the handles where the adjustment part is, are weak and won't last for long. 2 of those failed after 4-5 opportunities. The others 2 I throught them at the bottom of the garage. Waste of money, rather pay for some other, even it is good."
2,Poor compatibility,"I bought 3 of these in hopes of hooking them together. Individually they are somewhat fun, but of the three I bought, and a fourth set a friend gave me, ALL 4 TRACKS ARE DIFFERENT. That means that I bought 4 sets with the intention of connecting them together, as the boxes imply, and basically they are stand alone toys. Some of the trains wont even move on other tracks. Also, some of the trains don't fit in the Thomas case I bought. Its hard enough keeping toys organized with toddlers, and this incompatibility makes playing with these toys frustrating. Read the labels carefully. Even though the box mentions adapters, 3 out of 4 of my kits are completely incompatible. I'll wait till my kids are a little older and get an HO set or get some simple Hot Wheels toys next year!!"
2,fenced OUT,"For basic fence building, this book is okay. It repeats much information, right down to the images, found in other fence books. Hmmm. But what's most frustrating about this book is the copious inclusions of photographs of fences and gates for which there are no designs. I'm not talking about exact designs, but rather guidelines for building the particular kind of fence; for instance, how to have the vertical pickets enclosed within lower and upper horizontal rails. No ideas provided. I actually called the publisher and asked, and got a run-around but no real answers except that because those photos are from private properties, they can't help. So why include them?"
2,Not that helpful,Bought this book to help with the design and installation of a fence and gate across the front of my house. Purchased it based partly on some of the reviews that others had posted. Did not see much that helped me in my situation or that I could not figure out on my own.
5,Excellent informational book about Elvis' movies.,"I've seen every single picture that Elvis made, and this book is the perfect guide to those movies. It includes all 31 of Elvis' movies, plus the two concert films that were made. It includes synopsises and behind the scenes look at all of the movies. It's a real rarity and a treat for every fan. Also it includes, publicity pictures, lobby card photos, record covers, movie posters, and everything. Every fan must have this book ""The Films of Elvis Presley."""
5,G-R-E-A-T,One of the best CDs ever! The only one better is David Civera's second disc (Que La Detengan)!!
5,"Gritty, raw boogie delta juke joint style Blues!","Bare bones minimum Blues music with new stylings, the kind you don't here anymore and wish you did! Enough rythm and boogie to get down and dance or groove with also! A favorite at The Crazy Coyote Blues Power Show 1490 KOTY AM Yakima Nation Reservation Radio in southcentral Washington."
5,Anything from Silverstein the kids LOVE,With Shel Silverstein as the author you can NEVER go wrong. The kids will LOVE LOVE it and use fun to build language vocabulary. So I LOVE it too.
4,Enjoyable book,"This wasn't the Shel Silverstein book that my niece wanted for her baby boy, but they nboth still seemed to enjy it."
1,Disappointed,"This is not a book. It is a hard cardboard fold-out that has pictures and the name of birds familiar to Arkansas. Each picture is about an inch and a half square. The entire thing measures about twenty four inches by eight inches. If it were only printed on one side it would make a nice wall poster, but since it is printed on both sides it is not even good for that."
2,Arkansas Birds,It was okay for a brief summary of the birds - was hoping for a little more information on each bird
4,These will get you started,I've used the FlashCards for both Net Ess and Server and passed both on the first try. I got an 899 on Server and these cards were part of that. I used these cards to get a start on the material and supplemented with the Exam Cram book and the MCSE Readiness Review (indispensable).
3,Bimbo Jones Remix,"This is worth it for the full lentgh Bimbo Jones remix of the song and you get the video too! The Beat Cult remix is okay, but mediocre at best."
5,A Superb Laser Printer,"I looked into several printers under $1000 before deciding on the Brother 1870N. This is a solid, quality printer. The instructions for set up are very thorough and easy to understand. I was able to set up the printer over a network within minutes after unpacking it. Both the manual tray and cassette tray worked flawlessly. The text and graphics are crisp and the built-in automatic duplex option performed beautifully. This feature is available in other brands, but you will pay a lot more! I am using this printer with a Macintosh Computer (Jaguar) and will highly recommend it to anyone interested in a new laser printer. You will pay at least $300 more on the Hewlett Packard side for the same features. This is certainly a best choice for either home office or power office printing."
3,What Ludwig really needed was a kick in the pants!,"I read this book after visiting Neuschwanstein and Linderhof. The tour guide we had went on and on praising Ludwig and his genuis so I came away with a romantic and sympathetic view of the man. After reading King's book, I couldn't help thinking that what Ludwig really needed was a hard swift kick in the rear! Ludwig's ideas about kingship and royalty were insulting to the rest of us common plebians. Perhaps at nineteen, I might have rallied around Ludwig as lost artistic soul but at the ripe old age of 33, I was just disgusted with him. One interesting thing, I did enjoy King's version of Ludwig's final days. His theory makes alot more sense to me than any conspiracy or suicide theory. I plan on visiting Neuschwanstein again in the spring. My eyes will be opened to a whole different reality this time around."
1,Why wasn't Fabio on the cover?,"What a disappointment! This is little more than an ill-concieved romance novel. The style is so dependent on purple, lush descriptive passages. King is at best, a meagerly competent writer with an extravagant royal obsession. His analysis and observations are superficial. The facts that he has gathered - only part of a fascinating story waiting to be told by a skilled author - are lost in a swirl of lavishly overdone prose, showy and boring. The book leaves one smiling at the irony of the title and the author's name."
3,Not as advertised...,This is NOT a general chemistry lab reference book. It IS a biochemistry reference book. If you need a lab reference for general chemistry you need to look for something else.
4,A compelling novel,"Since You Went Away by Dean Hughes is an amazing story that observes the outlook of many different people all striving to survive World War Two. Never once was I bored while reading this book, however due to the many story lines at times it was sometimes hard to keep up. But in the end all characters had a gripping story to tell- well worth the time!"
2,Flying Saucers are Hostile,"I bought this oldie used when I saw it referenced in a newer publication. Since it's decades old, it is quite out of date, but the key was the implicit promise of hostile action on the part of flying saucers. While some evidence (not well documented) of hostile acts (or at least harmful acts) are provided in Chaper Two, the rest of the book is a review of the field as of that early time. In short, the book's title promises more than it delivers -- for which we can be grateful of course. Interesting mostly as a snapshot of what the UFO field looked like in the mid 20th Century."
1,Pure sensationalism,"You'd think by reading Flying Saucers Are Hostile that the planet Earth was (at the time the book was published) teaming with squadron of malicious flying saucers bent on inflicting pain and suffering to any human who dare cross their path.Steiger documents case after case where flying saucers have supposedly been responsible for cars being driven off roads, people being scarred and burned by lazer beams and the like, airplanes being shot out of the air, and a whole host of other ungodly atrocities.This is, of course, pure sensationalism. This whole book is devoid of logical, reason and credibility. The writing is poor and hackish. In short, this is not a book to be taken seriously."
2,Not The Quality I Expected,This puppet was not very good quality. It arrived with a slight dent in the mouth area. The teeth were bent indward and it was stiff and awkward to use as a puppet. I ended up returning it because it wasn't worth the $18 I paid for it.
4,Warne Marsh should be a household name in jazz,"But it isn't, and it's truly a shame.W.M.'s playing comes out of the Lennie Tristano school, and he is most known for his successful stint with Lee Konitz in Tristano's band.On this album, Marsh proves to be an excellent leader. His authority is clear, he really swings, his phrasing is relaxed, his tone is beautiful, round and deep, but sometimes also with a welcome edge, and his ideas are fluid and intelligent. This is a truly fine album by a great player, and it's worth many hours of listening!"
4,Jazz Oboe? Who'd a thunk it!,"Love the RVG remasters. A lot. This one is amazing. A refreshing change from the stock-in-trade Blue Note recordings. The ""snake charming"" oboe sound and even a bit of Dave Bruebeck style percussion make this album well woth purchasing for your collection."
2,pale comparison to original,"Just heard this to see if this is the same as the Billy Ocean hit. It is. However, it doesn't come close to matching the fun and energy of the original. Check out Billy Ocean for this great song and others instead."
1,Why?,"It's not that this album is bad, in fact all 10 songs are good. But what was the point? All are previously issued studio versions of songs from albums that are already in print. And though hits ""Lido Shuffle"" and ""Lowdown"" are there, it's in no way a ""best of"" collection - the remaining songs are album tracks or very minor hits. Three tracks are from Slow Dancer (1974), two are from Silk Degrees (1976), three are from Down Two Then Left (1977), and two are from Other Roads (1988), yet 1980's Middle Man is not represented at all for some reason. If you want a low-priced compilation, spring for the much more representative Hits!, and if you want a more extensive overview, buy the My Time anthology."
3,I have no idea what this album's about,"When I went to the record store the other day,I saw this tape of Boz Scaggs.I glanced at the music sellections,and saw ""Low Down""and ""Lido Shuffle."" I thought it was a greatest hits Tape,or a live album.After playing the record,I never heard of any of the music except for the two fantastic hits I mentioned.The only other song I really enjoyed was ""We're Waiting."" Its produced beutifull,with a great horn driven sound throughout the cut.I still can't understand why you would put two hits from the 70's on a new record?Inside the tape there's no linner notes. I have no idea who the musicians are,and when the record was made,but for 4 bucks,I still got myself a bargin."
1,cheap quality,"I had this watch for two weeks and the metal band broke. in addition sometimes the button that controls the indiglo gets ""locked "" in the on position"
3,Nice Workout but Doesn't Work Well on a DVD player,"The DVD contains a nice yoga workout, but unfortunately doesn't work well in a regular dvd player. It works just fine on the dvd in my computer. I think this DVD was generated on the computer. So, if you intend to use it on your computer, it would be a great buy. But, if you want to use it on your regular DVD player, the video either doesn't work, skips, sticks,etc."
4,"a thoughtful, insightful John Denver","This is an overlooked but very worthwhile album, even if it only included its two beautiful love songs (""Never a Doubt"" and ""For You""), a song of a soul yearning to do and be more (""Higher Ground""), and a playful song of simple, homespun delights (""Homegrown Tomatoes""). But ""Falling Leaves"" borders on being a masterpiece. It is a haunting song about refugees that asks ""Are they not some dear mother's child? Are they not you and I? Are we the ones to bear this shame? And they the sacrifice?"" Denver's socially conscious and responsible poetry belies his image of a simple country boy."
4,Good evening with John Denver,"Best John Denver album that I have. Great song ""Sing Australia"" and a lot of others. A happier time for music."
3,Zantrex-3 - Listing Incorrect,"I've taken Zantrex in the past and it works well for me. Its potent enough that I only have to take half the recommended dose, making it one of the most cost effective weight loss products I've ever used.Beware: This listing is for 112 Capsules... I received 112 TABLETS. This might not sound like a big deal but I find tablets much harder to swallow and take longer to take effect. Four Star Product but I'm disappointed I didn't receive what I ordered."
1,DO NOT BUY,"I BOUGHT THIS PRODUCT AND IS VERY UPSET WITH IT. DOES NOT HIDE YOUR LEAF SPRING SHAKLES, MINE JS WARPED IN THE MIDDLE. MAKES THE TRUCK LOOK LIKE S***"
5,The Greatest,"Two of the Greatest Performers that ever did it!!! As Frank would say -""They Did It There Way!!""What great music they had in those Films of thier""s.Especially in ""Anchor's Aweigh"" - I was a young Teenager on leave before going overseas when this Movie came out, and I took my Girl to see it!!!When ever I heard any of the Songs on the Armed Forces Radio it would bring back some great memories of Home,Family,and my Girl FriendJust as it doe's when I See The Movie/Or Hear the music now!!That was the Big thing about the Musicals of the 40's Thru the 60's,you came out whistling one of the Songs from the Movie..And those songs are everlasting!!Paul Maier - Veterans Home CA."
4,Classic Musicals and just plain fun,"If you are a fan of the ""oldies,"" whether Sinatra, Kelly, dance, songs or musicals, you need this collection. They were more innocent times (not necessarily better) and a bunch of sailors on the make in New York city (""On the Town"") was not cause for concern but rather FUN to be had."
3,sinatra and kelly movies,"I enjoyed the three movies.However I am complakning about the dvd ""high society"". i cannot play this dvd becauseis not able to be played in this area also the dvd is fo rental or resale. i paid for anew dvd. this is the second time i have trouble with this dvd. the first one was lostand the second one is as i stated. i am very unhappy with amazon. i have dealt with you for many yeaes and this the first time i have nad trouble."
1,Sinatra/Kelly,"While the clarity and color and music still holds up and is bothsingable and enjoyable, the dialogue is severly dated and the actingnot what one remembers from seeing it the first time around. Actually it'srather sad. Movies like these are best left to memory."
1,"HEADS UP: NO ""WHEN THE LION ROARS""","The one star is not for the movies, but as a warning to those who have read the decriptions of the extras, and are expecting the full documentary""When The Lion Roars"". Hang onto your 3-vhs boxed sets, because when you open the DVD case, you discover that there is only an ""excerpt"" from the this long awaited documentary. Maybe sometime soon we'll get the wholeshelang, but not now."
4,Leaves you wanting more,"This is a great set. All three films are wonderful examples of MGM at it's finest. The only reservation I have is that the DVD set leaves you wanting more. These films just beg to be produced in the same ""Night at the Movies"" style as the Esther Williams Collection, with newsreels, cartoons, trailers and the like. Buy it while you can, however, because the low price just MUST be an error!"
3,Almost...,"I was so excited to get these DVDs...so you can imagine the disappointment when I popped 'Take Me Out to the Ballgame' in the DVD player and it didn't work. Anchors Away and On the Town both work perfectly, but the other causes my DVD player to not respond and also makes my TV shut off completely."
3,Happy light entertainment,"Pleasant entertainment. Too light to get into details since they would sound negative, but one can see how Sinatra's film career was sliding - until The Man With The Golden Arm. Kelly on the other hand seems to be the eminence gris of the acting and dancing. Clearly a very strong-minded, creative entertainer with a future."
5,Puzzle Craft (1985 and 1992 versions) available on CD-ROM,"Both versions of Puzzle Craft are included on The Puzzling World of Polyhedral Dissections CD-ROM, which is available on amazon.com.ISBN: 0966636104"
1,Snipers and Vipers info,"Overall they suck, the snipers have good range but everything else sucks. The vipers are ok because they have a sweet movement stat, but everything else sucked about them too."
3,It's growing on me... sort of,"Just before I made a laughing stock of myself by announcing the magical disappearance of cellulite from my thighs it occurred to me that the smoothness and glow is a result of the few weeks I've used this product.I agree that it smells terrible, and am a bit wary of daily use of anything that contains soy oil --- and this has a lot of it. I really dislike how oily it makes my hands. Though dry, my hands respond better to fast absorbing products like Palmers'.Shea and Cocoa are both supposed to fade scars and marks so I hope this will do the trick. I was planning never to use this product again and boughtVaseline Smoothing Body Butter with Cocoa and Shea Butters 8 oz (227 g)which is just so expensive. Now I'm not so sure. Well, I'll use the Vaseline and decide."
4,Listen carefully!,"If you are a TT fan like I am, you probably compare everything to ""Into the Gap"". I do agree that it was an excellent album although I think Queer was even better. However, even though this album is totally different than everything they've done, don't make the big mistake of dismissing it! First of all, as an artist myself, I am still trying to make drums sound this good. They rock on this album! Never before could you hear Tom Bailey's voice so harsh and letting go. Joe Leeway had just left the twins and you can feel the anger and dissapointment. A must-have for any TT fan."
2,Love the Twins - But this is Boring!,"Hate to say it, but if your looking to expand your TT collection after discovering the pleasure of The Gap or Sidekicks or perhaps Babble, make sure this is the LAST recording you seek as it will give lease satisfaction. I really think is for die hard fans/completists only. As someone below mentioned, this record really killed their career."
5,ONE OF THEIR BEST!!,"WELL, EVERYONE SEEMS TO THINK THIS IS THE TT WORST ALBUM. I DISAGREE. ACTUALLY, THIS ALBUM ALONG WITH SIDEKICKS IS MY FAVORITE.""FOLLOW YOUR HEART"" AND ""THE LONG GOODBYE"" ARE MY TWO FAVE TT SONGS EVER. ""THE LONG GOODBYE"" HOLDS A SPECIAL PLACE IN MY HEART. AND ON THIS ALBUM, I THINK TOM BAILY'S VOCALS ARE STRONGER THAN ON ANY OTHER ALBUM. THE CHORUS TO DANCING IN YOUR SHOES IS PROOF OF THAT. SOME OTHER HIGHLIGHTS HERE ARE ""SAVAGE MOON""-(...if i could beleive in fairytales, a life of happy endings that would never ever fail...), ""GET THAT LOVE""- THE ONLY TOP 40 HIT FROM THIS ALBUM. AND THE ROCKIN' ""STILL WATERS""THIS IS THE HARDEST TT ALBUM TO FIND, SO IF YOU CAN FIND IT, GET IT."

5,Strongly recommended,This book discussions of COM is very thorough and hands on exercises provide immediate feedback. This book will broaden your understanding of COM
2,"Good, but very light. Best suited for introductions.","I purchased this book hoping to get a better understand of COM and how it relates to VB. While I did get some of that, I was still left hungering for more meat. Very little of this book is dedicated to understanding the inner workings of COM. Although this book is well written and informative, it is just too introductory for a book that is suppose to be for enterprise developers. Thus if you want a basic introduction to COM buy it. If not, don't."
3,A nice intro to COM.,"This book is excellent if you're new to COM. But, If you already understand the basics, Save your money."
3,Average for the average,For those who have had some contact with COM/MTS this book might fill the gaps. But for those with a little more experience it's only a confirmation of what already learned. I expected more from this title I'm sorry to say. Not a bad book for beginners/intermediate though.
2,more a feature list of VB exotica than a serious book,"The author's style is nice and clear, but just as each chapter starts getting into real issues it stops. You get the feel that the author spends too much time evaluating features and not enough time working on real projects"
4,"Not THE best cowgirls, but one of the best!","These guys are so reliable. Pat Todd is getting older but he still writes great songs, and has great artisic integrity. He has to be one of the only 50 year old rockers that still writes and performs like it's his first record.All the songs are good, but some stick out as great: Boerne Girl, Burning Daylight, and Give It Away.Buy this thing if only to support one of the last true rock n roll bands left! And see them live. They never disappoint!"
5,quality dinnerware,I can't believe I bought dinnerware without looking and feeling them first. These are BIG and heavy and the design is very nice. The dishes are bigger than my old ones and barely fit in my old dishwasher. The bowls are quite large also. These are not dainty dishes. The red color is just right. I've been using them everyday for 1 month and am very pleased. They are $10 cheaper on Amazon than on Overstock.com. Good quality.
1,BAD Pfaltzgraff pattern!,"I purchased these because they were so cheery, and I already had Naturewood, which are very heavy and chipfree. However, these are a different weight and quality entirely. Within 6 months of purchase (and handwashing) over 50% were chipped. I got tired of being frustrated everytime I saw them, and threw out the chipped ones and donated the rest to Goodwill. Good riddance!"
3,Amusing but Unremarkable,"Miss Dove is an institution in her small hometown. She teaches the elementary grades with an iron fist, requiring her students to mindlessly memorize facts of her choosing and to behave like little men and ladies. After teaching several generations of children, now Miss Dove has a back ailment that causes her to miss class for the first time in her life. Her former students, now grown up into doctors, preachers, and even criminals, help her during this stressful time of the unknown by visiting and waiting on her and reminding her of the impact she had on their lives and on the town.An easy read with no chapter breaks aside from a few sketched drawings, this book is simply written with a simple message. It does not make a big impact, but it is pleasant reading and makes one think of the teachers that have impacted our lives."
5,Excellent example of how one teacher can influence many.,"I first read this selection in my early teens. I returned to re read the book after seeing Jennifer Jones during the Oscars this past March. In the years in between, the story hasn't lost any of its alure. Miss. Dove is the teacher everyone dreads, yet always remembers. Many in her small town believe she had no previous life apart from being ""the terrible Miss. Dove."" Yet as she influenced their lives for one school year; she changed their lives forever. Jennifer Jones' movie came out in 1952, but is not on video. Thus readers must depend on the book to visualize the life and quiet power of an extra ordinary teacher. Perhaps, those of us who loved the book could persuade Paramount Pictures to release the movie to video. It is a treasured classic, in either medium."
5,Great book!,I was amazed and very pleased with the excellent condition this book was in. The delivery was prompt and wrapped very nice in tissue paper. The story is very inspiring and well worth reading.
4,I like it -,"I just purchased this case as well as the Z22. Mine closes, I have 3 credit cards on one side of the flip, school ID's on the other side of the flip. I have also placed my money ($70) in the back pockets (behind the credit card flap). AND YES ... I have my lipstick in that stupid little loop. It closes, my palm is not smashed. The Palm doesn't slide out, I resync without taking it out of the case. AND to turn it off ... just push the button (through the leather). I have mine set so that its not activated when the screen is touched. I gave it 4 stars, because I wish it came in other colors. :-)"
4,Palm Z22 Lover,"I love my Palm Z22 Handheld. This every day case is a good addition. My only regret is there is no pocket for coins. I had purchased the other leather case and it really did not hold as much. This case has a mirror, plenty of pockets for credit cards and ID cards. This every day case fits inside my purse. I can carry the every day case without my purse when going to outdoor functions and I don't want to be loaded down with a large handbag - this works perfectly."
3,This is Brown -- I thought it would be Black!,"To be fair, no color description was provided, but from the photo, and my experience with Palm, I fully expected to receive a Black case, and am a bit befuddled to receive a Brown one. This does not complement the rest of my ensemble (which is not a non-issue with me) but I suppose I can live with it. It does look like it will do the job. But the darn color! Disappointing only on that account. (Really!)"
4,Great case for a Z22!,"After researching the many types of cases out there, I went with this one based on all of the reviews of cases for the Z22. I love it! It doesn't smell bad (someone had reviewed that theirs did) and it fits the Z22 perfectly. The on/off switch is covered and I recommend locking your keypad so it doesn't get turned off/on accidentally. I only wish they had other colors available."
3,Too bad it doesn't have a change pouch,The case would be a very good product if it only had a pouch for coins. I was very disapointed to see that it did not.
4,good case,"It works, the z22 fits well, and it has credit card space. However they should made a ""men"" case, without the mirror so you could have more space for something else, or make it thinner. Kinda hard to press the on/off button."
4,quality knives,"A variety of knives for your everyday kitchen use. Although it says dishwasher safe, a few have already had a bit of rusty spots on them."
2,Nice looking but dull,"These are some nice looking knives, they feel very nice in your hands too. Unfortunately, they are very dull. Perhaps they can be sharpened if I take them to a professional store, but one should not need to do so with new knives."
4,Farberware knives,"These knives are good. I could cut ripe tomatoes without mushing it. The are handy, good looking & very easy to clean."
1,WATER broke the knife blade in two,"A clean cut on the 8"" cutting knife. I took it out of the dishwasher(I know I'm not suppose to dishwash it due to rust spots, but it's the holidays and we had a lot to clean), took it out and only 1/2 of the 8"" cutting knife came out, the other 1/2 was suck in the utensil bin of the washer. A nice, clean cut. Go fugure. Also, though the all metal design is sleek, but there are a couple particles of metal rolling around in the handle area of some of the knifes...no big deal, just annoying. It's not a bad looking set, works fine...but geez, broke in two by water."
2,They rust easily,"I bought these knives from Bed Bath and Beyond partly because they look so good.The first time I used them, I put them in the dishwasher as usual. On taking them out of the washer I noticed that they didn't seem quite clean. I thought, ""oh well, the washer is acting up."" Then I noticed that it was not a food stain but rust. My cool looking knives were rusting after one washing. Now I take care to immediately hand wash and dry the knives after each use. It seems a shame that the knives are called stainless. If they had been called rustable knives, I would not have bought them. Otherwise, they are good knives. They seem to hold an edge and they look great.BOTTOM LINE: If you hand wash and dry your utensils after each use or don't care about the appearance, these are excellent knives at a good price. If you like to put your knives in the dishwasher after use -- keep shopping."
3,Great Price,"The knives seem OK. When I opened the box the black block was alittle dinged up and the chef's knife seemed like it had been dropped as there was a ding/scrath on the handle. It was enough damage to send back and pay for shipping, but I would have preferred it to be in a little better shape. The knives sharpen and cut well, though. Great price, good knives, we'll see how they stand up to the test of time..."
4,Nice set of Cutlery,"Do date the set has made a nice addition to our kitchen with its sleek one peice blades. They appear to be extremely sharp, and with the included sharpening rod will stay that way for a long time. However, I must note that I haven't had them long enough to determine if there are any problems with the blades or the wood storage block they come in. But for overall satisfaction compared to my previous set that I have had for five years they are a cut above."
2,"Attractive, effective but easily rusted set of knives.","Naively, I expected that Amazon would remove an item that was below some standard. I believe this product is essentially defective in that, despite their ""stainless"" designation, the knives rust immediately if not completely dried after every washing. A dishwasher is absolutely out of the question.I will admit that they are very reasonably priced (aka ""cheap""), very attractive on the counter, very well-balanced and, thus, very easy to hold and use, but I believe our money would be better spent on another, more expensive brand.I will further admit that I did not consult the customer reviews Amazon offers, trusting their judgment in carrying the item (and being so late in my holiday shopping).Amazon should remove this product from its catalogue!"
4,good value,"First, a number of reviews below express suprise and indignation that ""stainless steel"" kniives would get discolored or rust in th a dishwasher or if not dried.Those reviewers have not bothered to learn anything about knives or metalurgy and the meaning of ""stannless steel"".Fact: ANYTHING made of stainless steel will rust in a dishwasher!Second: these are good knives which sharpen to a good edge and have an intelligent balance. A decent value for the price."
4,Great Item for the price,"Well I see this was such a great deal that amazon raised the price. I paid 26.99 for my set. And.. the best part! Its a 15 piece set, you get a meat cleaver also. The block is much improved over the picture on the website. The quality is 10 times better!The knives are not that bad. Nicely weighted and cut what I need. You cannot compare these to Wusthoff or other brands cause dollar for dollar, there is no comparison.If you looking for a solid, good looking set of knives, I would give these my recommendation"
2,Looks pretty in your kitchen but doesn't function too well...,My dad bought these knives from a Service Merchandise before it closed down. I think he payed about $100 on them. We have had the knives for about 2 years now. For some reason I am the only one to use them in the whole household. Otherwise they're up there for looks. I only hand wash them and I dry them right after they're washed. They seem to be decently sharp out of the box but nothing to rave about. I've noticed that many of these knives are rusting. This comes a surprise to me as they are supposedly STAINLESS. I've come to learn this is a problem with many cheap knife sets. I guess you get what you payed for. I would avoid these knives. Unless you want your kitchen to look good and you're never going to use them. Do yourself a favor and payup for a quality set that will last you years.
2,Not very sharp,"I had previously purchased the Farberware pro stainless chef's knife and was really impressed with how sharp it was and attractive too. So I bought the whole set, but they are so dull that I don't even want to use them. Very disappointed. And I wish they didn't come with a black holder, it's too masculine looking."
3,Nice set at a reasonable price,"I purchased these for less than $30, and overall, I am very pleased with this set. The block that I received is not wooden, and is much nicer than the one pictured on Amazon. I do advise that you handwash these and dry them completely when finished. Otherwise, you may end up with rust or water spots. I am very proud to display these on my countertop. They are durable and easy to work with."
2,Cheap Ok knives but cheap build quality....,"Well they served there purpose as ok knives in the kitchen. They have been the a pain though, they are pretty bad at holding an edge but you get what you pay for. I use an accusharp sharpener on them often and it definitely helps. They'll cut but after about 3 years now they are literally falling apart. The plastic that holds the blade in the handle has cracked and broken on several rendering them useless and too dangerous to keep around. Guess its time to invest in some new ones, but I won't be buying more farberware ones. I fish often, and cook quite a bit so I have ended buying several decent quality fillet knives so have learned a little about what makes a good knife and what brands are best. I like the victorinox knives as well as the dexter russels so will likely use this same knife block and just start buying individual knives of various quality to fill it. I'll get my moneys worth out of this set but wouldn't recommend it."
1,Faberware Knives,I also loved these knives but now am throwing them away due to rust spots all over them. I hand wash and dry most often but still ended up rusty. Very disappointed as I had owned the same set previously without this occuring.
1,JUNK... Started rusting one week after I bought them!,"I don't take the time to write reviews, but I will make an exception in this case. One would think after spending over $50 for a set of knives that you would be getting some good quality stuff. Not the case here. YES the knives are sharp... and the steak knives do cut a steak... but it just pisses me off that my steak knives started rusting ONE WEEK after I bought the set. If you think you might be putting these in the dishwater or let them soak a little bit in the sink, don't buy these knives. With the rust that started showing up after a week I would be surprised if they would be in use in any household after a year. Send these back to China."
2,Knives are fine for the occasional cook,"The knives in this set are very nice looking, but are fairly mediocre in quality. They are fine for the person who doesn't need the greatest knives to get the job done or for someone who does as little cooking as possible. The wood block is of poor quality. I ordered 2 of these sets and sent them both back because of major flaws in the block. One had a very visible crack all the way up the back and the other was not put together well. Parts were not glued on straight and the black stain was missing in a few spots. The knives and block are made in China so I guess you get what you pay for. After sending this back I treated myself to a 10 piece set of Sabatier Grand Chef knives and also ordered the Sabatier Grand Chef steak knives. Sabatier also has some cheaper lines made in China, but due to my experience with the Farberware knives I opted for Sabatier's higher end line made in France."
2,A lot smaller than expected..,"A lot smaller than expected. Wouldn't buy again, even if I had a million dollars. Would have to triple it to get decent use."
5,wave on!,"Love this! Got it for body surfing off the Atlantic coast. You curl the edge a bit to literally catch the wave, and it's much more comfy for your chest/belly than a boogie board. I wish it came in more colors, but it doesn't matter. It's red on one side and blue on the other with a rope going through grommets all the way around for carrying. It makes a great pillow when laying on the sand. It's also really convenient for travel, as it deflates and takes up much less space in the car. Just make sure you don't leave it in the sun all summer or it will discolor and crack, and make sure it doesn't mildew by storing it still wet."
1,didn't hold air . .,"Unfortunately this raft didn't hold air, but when contacted, the retailer refunded my money. I was disappointed, as it was just what I had been looking for."
5,Well made,This item arrived quickly and was well made. I haven't used it enough to assess how long it will last. It seems like it will last long though.
2,Save Your Money,"I was so excited when I saw this CD. It had so many songs on it and already had one great review. I thought between that and the hefty price on it, it must be a fabulous karaoke cd. This was NOT the case. While this Cd does contain many songs that are not on most standard karaoke cds, the majority of them sound like midis, not well orchestrated karaoke songs. For the money I spent on this, I expected A LOT more. If there had been samples to listen to before I bought it, I would not have wasted my money. If you really like Les Miserables and want great karaoke versions of your favorite songs, this is not the disc to get. The only reason I even gave it two stars was for the fact that it had so many songs on it.As a side note, when I received this Cd, one of the cds was missing out of the box, so I ended up having to exchange it.A very disappointing purchase. I recommend getting a karaoke disc with fewer songs but much higher quality."
1,"If it were possible to give 0 stars, I would.","Let's start with the music quality. There is none. Once again, the Stage Stars Modus Operandi is to use music that is at least a decade old midi technology; this is absolutely inexcusable in an era when a company can buy music samples from philharmonic orchestras. Secondarily, the tempo on many of the songs is too fast. Third, and again, a major bone of contention, is if a KARAOKE company is going to take the time to produce a song with a counterpoint lyric duet, then to not include counterpoint lyric encoding is totally unacceptable."
5,Great book! Still waiting for this series on DVD. What's the holdup?,"This review was updated in September 2010.Michael Winship's book is an excellent companion to an excellent series which deserves to be available on DVD. The eight episodes aired on PBS from January-March 1988. I taped every episode and still refer to them today. When I taped the series, I didn't have cable. As a result, the pictures quality of my tapes suffered. However, that's better than not having the series at all. In 2008, I converted my VHS tapes of the series to DVD.Edwin Newman provides very authoritative and easily understood narration. I had just graduated with a journalism degree when this series aired. The book and series are great study tools for anyone pursuing careers in broadcasting. Those who just enjoy revisiting classic television moments will also appreciate this series."
5,An Enticing & Romantic Read,"How wonderful to read all the details we all really want to know. Rich with detail, this carefully researched fan-fic was so much fun, I couldn't wait to see how it all turned out. It reminded me of early Danielle Steele, fast paced and full of romance. It was so emotionally satisfying to see a L.A. girl capture the heart of one of the world's most eligible bachelors! I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in the inner workings of the Royal Family. A very satisfying read."
5,Katherine,I love the royal family and especially Prince William. I loved this story. It gave me insight on what he might be like and how his family is. A true love story.
1,Only good for a few models,"As the others have said, this book is not very good. I found one by Haynes which is much better; for example, I used it for a 626, a very popular model. The Chilton's was dead wrong in some areas and very poor in most others. The Haynes was dead ON in all areas I needed. That seems to be true for the whole book; forget the chilton's (which has been an excellent source in the past for these kinds of manuals), and, in this case at least, buy the Haynes, which is also cheaper, by the way!"
2,A univeral anything tends to fit nothing,"I'd have to agree with the last reviewer's 2 star rating, and that's being generous. Usually Chilton does a good job, but trying to cram all these different models in one book is not the way to go. I own a 626, and just about every time I tried to follow a procedure, the text would refer to something that was only pictured for the other models (usualy the Miata or 323), and of course when I eventually figured it out on my own the item mentioned was in a totally different place, looked different, etc. Unfortunately this was the only book I have found for a 1993 626."
2,Crapola,"This book is hardly useful for any REAL repair work. Putting information on several different cars that are hardly alike all together in one book simply does not work. i.e. Engine repair shows specific examples for a mx-3 or whatever, but not for others. The Electrical diagams are incomplete making them totally confusing. Most importantly. THe sole reason why I bought this book is for Vacuum diagrams, which is indicated on the cover of the book. There is not one vacuum diagram for any car in the entire book."
2,"Hard to follow, shold have been broken up by car and model","I am an owner of a 93 mazda mx-6. I found the information provided to be scetchy at best. I purchased this book because I was interested in the wiring diagrams which were ""now included"". They were included for all makes, save the mx-6."
3,"tastes OK, does not dissolve completely","taste is not badWill not dissolve completely, have tried mixing it in warm, room tempand cold water. not sure what component of the ingredients is not dissolving, but I feel I am not getting my moneys worth."
3,didn't notice anything,"i read all the reviews and thought this would be a great product to help me keep my stamina up while training brazilian jiu-jitsu. The first thing I noticed is this stuff doesn't mix well, especially if you put it in cold water. It just clumps up and sits at the bottom of your water bottle. Next, I noticed that my arms & neck got bright red - almost like a chemical burn - after using this stuff. I'm guessing there must be a lot of niacin in the product, but it isn't listed on the package. Niacin will cause extreme flushing if you OD on the stuff. The flavor of the melon one is awesome. I'm also trying the gel version and haven't had the same problem of red flushed skin reaction, or the mixability issue, but I still haven't noticed more energy during my workout with either product."
1,"had during marathon--disgusting, not effective","I ran my 7th marathon in which all that was available was HEED lemon. I almost gagged at the taste--yes, it's not sweet, which would have been fine if it had some kind of flavor but it just tastes like water with a peel of lemon--it did nothing to boost my energy or make me feel replenished of electrolytes. Give me back my gatorade or powerade!"
4,Good light tasting electrolyte drink,"I recently started using this drink for marathon training because my previous electrolyte drink was unavailable. I originally tried the melon flavor and it was nasty, but the lemon/lime is drinkable, though I would not have it as a pool side beverage. I train in the Arizona heat and cramping is an issue, but using this product I have not had any issues, so it seems to do the trick. I wanted something very light and without corn syrup, so that is why I chose this. Happy so far."
1,Disgusting!!!,"This is the first review I have ever written, and I am only writing this to tell everyone how gross this stuff is. I figured I would give this a shot as I am in the middle of training for a marathon. I purchased the Orange flavor, and was excited to give it a try. First thing I noticed was it really didn't mix very well with water. There was quite a bit of sediment floating around and powder at the bottom of my shaker. I then took a sip, and it is disgusting! It only has a slight flavor to it, which makes it even worse. Finally, it makes my stomach feel terrible after drinking it.I have tried to drink this stuff multiple times, hoping it will get better. But, its safe to say it's going in my trash can."
2,Disappointed again,"I am a long-standing and ardent Susan Johnson fan, but the disappointing trend of her recent writing (Taboo, Golden Paradise, A Touch of Sin, To Please A Lady) continues in Temporary Mistress. The characters were one dimensional, the dialog was stilted, the plot lacked continuity or cohesion, and the love scenes lacked heat. I have read worse historical romance, but not by Ms. Johnson."
1,"My new star of ""All-TimeWorst Romance"" List","I'm very glad I was loaned this book and didn't have to shell out any money. In the past when I've found myself reading what is obviously trash, I merely toss it or return it to the person who lended it to begin with. Temporary Mistress was so bad I had to finish it out of curiosity--besides, I was getting a big laugh at the publisher's expense--not to mention the author.Dermott whatever-his name and the ""heroine"" whose name escapes me were equally horrible. In fact they deserved each other. He is the worst all time loser who scores with every woman he can, and she is an idiot who thinks staying in a brothel for protection is a real good idea. I found nothing that even remotely resembled a romance plot.I'm voting with my pocket book and won't purchase anything from Susan Johnson--ever."
2,"Not one of Susan Johnson better books, but okay","""Temporary Mistress"" by Susan Johnson is not one of the author's better books, yet it does have good aspects. Among then the lead female character is strong and willing to do anything to help herself. The lead male character is some what dumb, and I'm not sure why any woman would want him. Fans of Ms. Johnson will more than likely not enjoy ""Temporary Mistress"" but if you are looking for a book to kill sometime, then this might just due."
1,We need a romance-novel rating system,"Darn--I picked up this Susan Johnson book by accident, and sure enough, it became quickly cold-blooded and obscene. Wish I could get my money back--sometimes I read the jacket copy and don't pay attention to the author's name, and the jacket copy sounded interesting enough.I also wish that there was some system for these no-talent erotica writers like Johnson not to be able to fool a buyer into expecting a REAL romance, where there's an entertaining plot of interesting characters that you might actually CARE about. Susie-Q got her education reading bathroom walls, I suppose."
1,Sooooo Disappointing,"I think this is her worst book so far .I really enjoyed her others but with this one I was really disappointed ,you would think someone else had written this book and put Susan Johnsons name to it. At the end of"" Temporary Mistress"" there is an excerpt from her new book coming out in the fall of 2001 ,from what i read it also seems to be as disappointing. So sad to see her writing go down ."
3,mediocre,"Not one of Susan Johnson's best books. I found it difficult tounderstand J's review, unless she is a teenager, her emotionsare immature. There is no reason to dislike the heroine of thebook and I certainly didn't get all worked up that the heroinewas wealthy. Afterall, she is just a fictional character and Isee no reason to hate a person who doesn't even exist. I foundbits of the book interesting, but overall it's a slapped togetherbook."
1,"Very Disappointing, not even borrowing.","Susan Johnson's books have been recommended to me, so I thought I would give it a tried and was DISAPPOINTED. The story line was predictable, the diaglogue was stilted and unbelievable, and the love scenes were tepid, the author must have thought throwing in four letter profanity would heat it up but it did not help this lifeless storyline."
5,"Emotional, Sensual, and One of Johnson's Best!","My favorite novel of Johnson...she could not have done a better job in character development, plot, tone, and drama. I actually felt the emotions of the characters in this masterpiece of historical romance. One becomes so engrossed and attached to these characters that you just cannot put this book down, you laugh and cry with them, and when the story ends, you wish for another 15 chapters. I highly recommend this book if you love passionate, emotional historical romance. Of the hundreds I have read, this is one of the best!"
2,first time,"I agree with almost all the reviewers in the fact that Temporary Mistress is big fat flop. Isabella Leslie is a dimwit I mean if she is a person of brains couldn't she think of another way of saving herself from her scrubulous relatives in order to keep her new fortune, other than becoming a mistress? Second, Dermott Ramsay I understand why he was such a rake, but I do not buy his I have to have her, the heroine, and yet sleep with every woman except for her. Even after he let her go he still continued to sleep with other women. That is not a knigt in shining armour but a lusting brute. Then after Dermott told her to take a hike and took his time she let herself fall to his feet like pudding. What a disgust."
1,Raunchy isn't romantic,"Someone must have told Ms. Johnson that throwing around four-letter words is a substitute for character development and plot. What emerges is an implausible premise held together by a string of livid sex scenes. I skimmed through it in a couple of hours, hoping for an improvement as I waded to the end. It was just a wasted $5.99 and two hours. It was cover-to-cover bilge. Tell me this isn't the new trend in ""historical romance."""
2,Unbelievable and poor,"Poor is the only appropriate word I can come up with for this book. Most romances require that we suspend our disbelief to a certain extent, but some part of the story has to hang together or we can't do that. The characterization in this book is completely incredible and unbelievable to me -- the actions and personality descriptions of the main characters do not match. Some of the historical details may be accurate but not the aggregate or the overall picture. The only reason I gave this two stars instead of one is that I did read it all the way through!"
1,Yuck!,"This book is often intriguing, with strong characters, but it veered into the crass rather than the romantic. The relationship was more about sex than love. Dermott was really bad to her, hurting her deeply. Isabella is just as sex-driven. Implausibilities abound, and terms and sayings are just too modern."
1,buggy ftp service,"Manual is still in Chinese, though an English translation was attempted.Cavalry did not even go as far as 'branding' this product. It seems that they took a hard drive, slapped it inside the bason enclosure, and then sent it along with Bason's manual (which is of a poor quality).I managed to establish an ftp session to the drive every other time. After a reboot, things do work better for the first 5-10 minutes.Security options are non-existent. You cannot even nest directories with security applied to the folder structure at different levels. All folders must be at the 'root' level - dumb.I'm sending mine back"
3,"Well, it was for a good cause","""The Doctor Who Cookbook"" was conceived as a fundraiser for some charity (I don't have the book in front of me right now, so I don't remember which). TDWC, like many celebrity and TV show based cookbooks, is of interest to rabid fans only. In addition...well, I'm going to indulge in a bit of cultural bashing here and say that British cooking is not something that most non-Brits like. Also, there's the cringe-provoking tendency to give the items cutesy Who-based names. I guess the writers assume that all Who fans are aged 9 and under....For the total whacko Who fan who owns everything already."
3,"Good, but not his best","I bought this album for two reasons: It is by accordion master Myron Floren; It contained the song ""Dance Little Bird."" Unfortunately, it's not the best I've heard of either. Myron's virtuosity on the accordian comes through reasonably well, but I've heard him perform much better when he was with Lawrence Welk. I've also heard much more energetic versions of ""The Chicken Dance."" I prefer the sound of Myron Floren on Polkas! by Lawrence Welk. Unfortunately, I have not found this album on CD. I have transfered the album to CD from LP, but the record was not in mint condition, so it contains many pops and scratches. I wish more of the polka albums of this era were available because they capture the energy of the WWII generation so well. Still, ""Dance Little Bird"" would be a good intruduction to Myron Floren and Polka music in general."
5,A fantasy to dream with again and again.,"Wonderful blend of real-time and stop-motion storytelling by a master of the surreal. An apparently ordinary everyman is led by curiousity into a dilapidated building which turns out to be a strange cross of theatre, a puppeteer's workshop, and an alchemical laboratory. Suddenly, he finds himself becoming the legendary character Dr. Faust, selling his soul to the devil to gain magical powers.Jan Svankmajer is the real sorcerer here and blends stage sets with real settings, seven foot puppets with live actors, and makes magic of it all.The film has been dubbed for English audiences, but I have never seen a less obtrusive film dub. The voice performances are excellent and actually add to the surreal quality of the film.Just one caution: This is not a ""family"" film. There is some adult material, so don't confuse this with Bass and Rankin style claymation."
4,Surreal Adaptation,"The classic Faust comes to life in a mixture of live action and stop animation from the Brothers Quay.Anyone who's a fan of the Brothers Quay will definitely appreciate this wonderful adaptation of Faust. I recommend reading the novel first, then watching this film for a better understanding of the storyline. In this surreal film version the story might be difficult to understand, but it's true to the original in every way.I highly recommend this film. It will haunt you and intrigue you at the same time. It's the classic tale with some memorable images that are surely difficult to forget."
4,good movie,"brillant movie, but hell and comedy dont really mix that well, thats why i only gave it a 4"
1,Not a fan,"I like animation and the Bros. Quay as much as the next guy, but when I saw this in the theater I found it overly long, self-indulgant, and the dubbed voices obnoxious. It reminds me of the sort of movie you'd see on Sunday morning on TV before the local stations got their network feeds: kind of dreary, outdated, and more farty than arty. Consider that this guy is now a sacred cow and reviewer-proof before you buy this DVD."
1,Worse movie ever,"I watch a hour of this movie before cutting my losses and speed watching til the end.... thank goodness I didn't waste my time watching the entire movie! I saw all the good ratings for this movie and figured someone should sound the warning not to waste your time... you can watch this movie without sound as it is almost entirely visual... there is some minor dialog, but it's all nonsense (trying to pose as intellectual philosophy)... really, don't waste your time... (by the way, this is the first time I've been compelled to rank a movie... it was THAT bad!)"
1,quite simply crap,This was one of the worst movies I have seen in a long time. It felt like an 80's flick with some BAD animation. For one thing the intro is tremedously long. This movie sucked and you should not waste your money
3,SLAP IN THE FACE,I believe that a dubbed soundtrack in such a high level movie resembles something like a slap in the face of the viewer. What happenned to the original soundtrack with the beautiful czech language melody?I hope next release won't underestimate our capabilities and sense of aesthetics...The movie really deserves five stars. The three ones were given thanks to the awful and unwilling distributor's work.
4,Outrageous adaptation!,"Jan Svankmajer made a clever adaptation about one of the everlasting classics of the literature, Faust.Thanks to the employment of puppets, as well as an agile handle of a febrile edition, he got to achieve and confer this well known philosophical portrait, an original view.Incisive, potent and extremely provocative."
2,Disappointing arguments,"I'm dissapointed at the arguments brougt forward by the philosopher in favor for the death penalty, Pojman. Even if you ignore the content of his arguments, the logic on which the argument was built didn't hold much water. Even though I'm myself against the dead penalty, I have seen others make a better and more coherent case for it. Pojmans last argument, that people that are against the dead penalty and pro choice are somehow immoral, is gratuitous and has nothing to do with an argument for the dead penalty. I would have expected a more thourough and convincing case."
4,Terrific book!,"While the story is so-so, the fact that it has magnets is a definite plus! Keeps the kids busy in the car, at home, anywhere and the magnets store nicely on the side of the book!"
5,Excellent Activity Book,We got this before a flight and it has been a great activity book for my 2 year old. He loves putting the magnets on the tracks and then saying 'goodnight' to them each evening as we put them back in the case. It's more activity than book. He loves it! Not a day goes by when we don't read it at least once.
3,Cute but small.,"There are only a couple pages and it is smaller than I expected, but I'm sure my nephew will still love it."
4,Thomas & Friends Book,This was purchased as a gift for a grandnephew. He enjoys it very much and is very happy with the gift.
1,Magnets don't stick!,I bought this playbook for my 2-year-old son and we were both very very disappointed because the magnets were so weak that they didn't stick. Waste of money...
2,Missing almost all of the magnets,"I'm NOT happy with this purchase. I paid way too much for a book with 4 out of 9 magnets missing.I don't even have a Thomas magnet and that's my sons favorite. I'm not happy at all. Otherwise, the book is cute and a good concept, I would absolutely LOVE this had all or even MOST of the magnets been there. I'm missing more magnets than the amount I have."
3,Not as verbose as we had hoped,"This book is more for your early reader. there are very few words (meaning one sentence) on each page. The youngest reader in your house can practice reading, but will have most of his/her fun putting the magnets on the pages.Don't get this book expecting to read a fleshed-out story. Get this book for your child to sit down by themselves and have some quiet book time or to have them read the pages to you."
3,magnet not very strong,"The book is good, but the magnet is not very strong and will not stick to the pages very well. They fall right off."
3,Magnets need to be heavier.,"Great concept, poor follow-through. The magnets are VERY weak and don't hold to the page very well. Bare movement of the page causes them to fall off. Still entertaining for a 23 month old who loves trains, but a pain when trying set up the picture in the book and they don't stay where he puts them."
4,Great book for outings!,This book is great when we go to dinner for my two year old. I don't end up with stickers all over the table and he likes the use the magnets when we are home too! Very cute!
5,Very entertaining and somewhat challenging.,I bought this for my 2 year old grandson and he loves it! It gives him an opportunity to be a little creative without being too hard and frustrating him.
4,My son loves it!,"Got it for the airplane ride and Thomas worked its magic for 45mins of the trip. Pretty good for my 3 yr old. I wish it had some educational pages (Put all the blue trains here, which train starts with the letter 'J', etc), but instead are landscape pages to decorate."
3,Just OK,Ordered this book as a gift. It was only a few pages long and came with a few different magnets. Was expecting a little more for the price. My child got bored after playing with it for a short time. It is sturdy and the magnets are easy to use but not much to the book.
3,Buy something else,"If you must, buy it. I think you can do better. The quality is good. At the time, my 2-year old enjoyed it for a few weeks until we lost most of the parts. There wasn't much in terms of imagination from the book, not many roads to play with. He loved Thomas, I'm just saying, if you are on a budget, you can do better. Look at my other Thomas books reviews."
3,"Boring, but OK","A magnetic book is a cool idea, but it's nothing special. The pages aren't very exciting so my son (who's almost 2) has already abandoned the book and plays with the train magnets on the fridge instead."
2,Two Thumbs Down,I bought this for my 2 year old nephew for Christmas. He loves Thomas the Train and didn't even look at it. The magnets don't really stick to the book and it's about 3 or 4 pages long with no real story. My nephew would rather play with his brothers' gifts and it makes me feel badly that this was such a poor gift.
5,best darn stock pot I ever used,I purchased this stock pot along with a set of pots and pans. this stock pot is the best pot ever and I have about 5 other aluminum ones which stink. Nothing sticks to this pot and I make a lot of cream base soups. I have been looking for a deal in purchasing another same pot.
4,Great stockpot - but the knob broke off the lid,"I have used this stockpot for about 10 months and I love it. The last time I washed the lid, the knob broke off. It should be covered under the ""Limited Lifetime"" warranty, but they want you to pay for the shipping to them for a determination of the warranty status. That's going to cost some money that they should pay for."
5,"Great Value, Fabulous pot","I love this pot. In fact, I love all my circulon. Nothing ever sticks and cleanup is a breeze. I cant believe this price, what a fantastic deal."
3,Non-stick will wear off!,"I have the 12 quart version of this pot and have had it about a year. It gets used about once a week. However, even after very careful cleaning and care, the non-stick feature no longer works. It's still a fine pot for soups, etc., that have lots of liquid but I bought it specifically for the non-stick merits! Also, the hi-lo grooves inside do make clean up a bit tricky, especially now that food doesn't just slide off as it did when new. Glad I didn't pay more for it."
2,The moment after,"I liked the message in this DVD, but it seemed ""low budget"" compared to the left behind series. The characters were not easy to relate to. I would choose the Left Behind series instead."
1,"Boring, Boring, Boring...","What a waste of time and money --- I should have read the customer reviews before purchasing this DVD --- the writeup said it was a ""thriller"" --- what it didn't say was how boring the film was --- god was it boring --- I sat there and just kept fast forwarding and it seemed like nothing was happening except a lot of pseudo-religious mumbo jumbo --- if I wanted that I would have gone to church or put on pat robertson.if you like being proselytized to, then by all means buy and watch this movie --- perhaps it will make you experience your own ""rapture"" --- otherwise don't even bother with it..."
4,Wonderful!,"A must have movie to add to your collection. A good motivator, however it left to many questions unanswered to be considered a great witnessing tool."
4,Moment after,"It sort of put me in the mind of another Left Behind,or The Omega Code. It does however get the point across that God always wins. Also makes you aware of never let the government put any type of number or code on you."
2,If You Don't Have Time to Look Elsewhere,"Order of Battle : Allied Ground Forces of Operation Desert Storm, is a pretty concise order of battle book on the larger units that were deployed during DESERT STORM. Army, Air Force, Navy, Marines and Reserve components are listed here. Additionally there are summaries regarding the conflict and the weapon systems involved. ... The price is very reasonable for this published resource and can be a point of departure for future study."
5,The Series Keeps Getting Better,"The best Psychic Eye so far!! In the fourth installment of the series, Abby Cooper goes out of town for a friend's wedding with Mercury in retrograde. Members of the wedding party go missing and Abby can ""see"" that some are no longer alive. In order to spare the bride strife before her big day, Abby secretly investigates the disappearances with the bride's brother, Abby's former crush. Things start to heat up for the pair, and thanks to Mercury, miscommunications pile up and relationships get rocky. The plot kept me guessing until the final pages when the evildoer was unmasked. The ending had me in tears. Victoria Laurie is quickly climbing to the top of the heap of my favorite authors!!"
5,another great book in a good series...,"A little more depth is given to the characters esp. Abby. This is a very good mystery/story and who would have thunk it, didn't figure out the murder in this one! It helps to read the previous books in this series before you read this one since it deals with Abbys social life a little, but you will not regret having to read the whole series, it's that good."
5,Best of the bunch?,"I'd say so! For the first time in the Psychic Eye series, Victoria brings the story out of Royal Oak as Abby is called on to be a bridesmaid at a friend's wedding in Colorado. The change of pace really pushes the series forward. We get to check in with the regular characters, but we're also introduced to a whole new group of colorful, interesting people.The book gets off to a heck of an exciting start, and it slowly becomes clear that Abby's fellow bridesmaids are getting killed off. It puts a damper on the wedding, but it makes for really exciting reading. As a fan of this series, I look forward to each volume because the author keeps switching things up. But she also keeps things grounded with a terrific main character who you really want to get to know. With so many authors faltering in their series, it's a thrill to see someone who keeps growing from book to book. I can't wait to see where Abby ends up next!"
5,Another great read in the Psychic Eye Series,"So yet again, we meet our hero Abby Cooper and there is yet another mystery to solve. We find our heroine going to Denver and meeting up with some old friends as she becomes a bridesmaid in her friend Ellie's wedding. However, she and Dutch have parted ways and other interesting things keep popping up. Mars is in retrograde pattern and that means issues with communication. Delightful as always.Also I didn't notice any huge errors in the kindle edition and still comes with a free preview of book #5 in the series."
5,I loved it !,"This book has been in my backpack for almost a year. After my sister read the novel and told me some of the storyline I just could bring myself to read novel. Today I picked up this book and devoured this novel. It has a great mix of heartache, romance, mystery and of course a psychic. Pick up this book and Enjoy! Moral of the story - don't listen to older sister!Check out the whole series;Abby Cooper #1: Abby Cooper: Psychic Eye, Abby Cooper #2: Better Read Than Dead, Abby Cooper #3: A Vision Of Murder, Abby Cooper #4: Killer Insight, Abby Cooper #5: Crime Seen, Abby Cooper #6: Death Perception (Coming out: September 2008)."
4,cute installment,"A good and fast paced installment to Abby Cooper Psycic Eye. Surprising ending.Abby can be engaging and fun but can also be irritating how whe wants so much from Dutch and does not ""think before she acts"" like so much of us.Great series.. look foward to the next one."
4,killer insight,"This book was another great installment in the series, but it seemed to move a little slow for me. The actual mystery took a few chapters to get off the ground.I hate to say that Abby is grating on my nerves a little with this whole ""liar, liar, pants on fire"" bit, and Dutch has got to stop saying ""sweethot."" Sometimes Abby seems cheesy to me. But I would definitely recommend this book and the rest of the series. The new supporting cast turned out to be interesting, and I almost didn't miss the regulars."
5,An actual page turner,"I stumbled across this title in a CVS. I don't normally read mysteries, but I was desperate that day. I was pleasantly surprised! The writing really draws you in.I just finished Better Read Than Dead and my heart is still pounding from the ending.Great series!!"
5,Dont pass this one up!,"If you're a fan of her other Abigail Cooper mysteries, then you'll love this one as well.It was just as great as her other 3 books and I'm looking forward to the next Abby Cooper story.I also can't wait to read the first in her new series 'What's A Ghoul to Do?: A Ghost Hunter Mystery'."
2,Going downhill,"I liked the first the first books enough to keep reading through this book. There were many a time when I felt like just giving up but no, Im trying to be a loyal fan so I persevered.I don't believe in giving away spoilers in reviews so I will just say this- I'm no longer a fan of this series as in this book the protagonist seemed so full of herself, it was really hard to keep reading as it all seemed to be all about Abby, how she looked, how hot she was and how she wanted to sleep with ****** and the mystery was just a minor thing thrown in. Which is too bad, I thought it had a lot of potential."
4,A fun book that becomes a souvenir,My children enjoyed this book (I bought one for each of them). They read it ahead of time to plan what they wanted to see on our first trip to Disneyworld and were able to record some of their favorite moments in the book as a keepsake.
4,Birnbaum's,"I like the information that they give because it is very truthful. The rides that I rode were explained very well. Although some information was a little vague, it is a very good book."
5,An Essential for your Trip!,"I have purchased this book for my children each time we go to WDW, it prepared the kids for the parks and any lines. I was also a parent of a child who wrote for the book if any parents want my views e-mail me @ Loraine213@aol.com"
5,This is the best book on Disney World ever written!!!!!!,"I love disney world and this is definitely my favorite guide on it. I am trying to get in the next book and sent in my application. If anyone from Brinbaum is reading this, include Sam Lerner in next year's tour!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
2,Who is this book for?,"The text and descriptions seem appropriate for a very narrow reading age. I had anticipated sharing the pictures and text with my 6 and 4 year old. But the text is dull and the book is very low on attraction photos. Half of the attractions have no picture at all, and others have only one picture.The book is bulked out with a few crossword type games, 5 blank pages for autographs and stock cartoon pictures.If your child has about an 8 year old reading level they might enjoy this, otherwise it has little to offer."
5,BRING BACK THE MITCHELLS!,"I have been a Hilda Van Stockum fan since elementary school. I loved the Mitchell series, especially ""Canadian Summer."" This is vintage Van Stockum -- rich, realistic characters one can recognize, sympathize with and love. One's heart goes out to little Catherine, the pre-schooler who feels upstaged by her twin brothers and taken for granted by an impersonal caregiver. One laughs with Peter and Patsy, who seem more like twins than siblings 2 years apart and I like the way they formed their own unit. Joan brought a voice of ""youthful maturity"" which certainly brought a smile to my face. This is really a wonderful book. I'm glad I have it. (I was lucky that it was available when my town library was having a book sale a few years ago. This book is a timeless classic)."
5,surprise,"This is the first time I have heard music by Al Bano Carrisi. I felt Italy closer to my heart when I heard his song. I fall in love with his voice. You might not understand the lyrics, but the rhyme of the music give you a flavor of Italy. It a good music to listen when you are stress, emotional drain, in love, happy, or hopeless."
2,VERY TALL!!,"Be careful!! I thought this was a bud vase (ie, for one stem) but it is actually about 2 feet tall! Not at all what I was expecting!"
5,phenomenal!,Michael exudes passion and warmth with every blissful syllable. The song is a sweet ballad of how the choices we make may be between the love that we've longed for and the dreams that we chase. Life is full of trade offs and our decisions determine the outcome.
4,What Happened?,"Such a nice little band. How come the good bands never get big? I guess that they have 4 albums after this one, but this album started it all. There's actually one before, an EP I guess, called This. At one point this album and the This album were packaged together. Keep your eyes open for it. That's the one you want."
2,"Some good reminders and stories, but nothing very deep","If you are wanting to be roused to action, this book can be of value. I am in a big leap of faith period myself and I found Robin's stories inspiring. Or rather..I chose to be inspired by them. Robin has a good sense of humor and the book moves along in a lively, spirited fashion.That being said, the book is really quite flat. Most of the wisdom is not original to Robin. Most of it is very obvious stuff: Be persistent, plan ahead, take risks, and so on. The book is basically Robin's life story, and it reads a lot like a VH1 behind the music special.I think musicians would enjoy this book. As for the rest of us,I think there are better inspirational books out there."
1,Don't waste your time,"The book is a typical how I changed my life and you can too by making me some more money. After reading the book and listening to a couple of his songs, the only person he cares about is himself.."
2,Doesn't seem safe,"Okay, gotta say that I don't know if our mice are the exact same,because we no longer have the packaging. I didn't buy these here,but they sure look the same.The jingle bells at the end of the tails need to be REMOVED immediately!Don't let your kitty cat have those!While it might be okay if you could supervise every waking moment, but you can't.With cats especially, you can't always see them when they are playing with toys,like when you are asleep or they hide under a couch.The balls are a good size for choking!NEVER give your cat something with jingle bells on them.While the noise might seem like fun and a good idea, it is a very real choking hazard.The manufacturers who place jingle bells and little pompons on cat toys apparently don't liketheir customers very much."
4,Leatherman Squirt S4,I purchased this for my husband. I didn't know there was more than one - there are three of this size and each has a slightly different set of tools. He likes this and uses it often. The quality is very good.
1,LAME!!!,This game is loud and annoying. It's pace is slower than Donald Trump's actual speaking and there is annoying music that plays while you are playing. We actually covered the speaker with a pillow and still found it to be too loud.The game is boring and lacks any intellectual need.
5,Spectacular,"As an instructor, I highly recommend this Classical Pilates DVD for beginning through advanced clients. Even if you do not own the equipment, but take lessons regularly, this is a complete collection of exercises which you will learn from your instructors. Understanding the nuances involved in performing the exercises correctly on the equipment can take years to comprehend. Classical Pilates' DVDs illustrate these points clearly and succinctly. Congratulations to Classical Pilates for a spectacular presentation of the original Pilates method of body conditioning."
5,A Must Read!,"Fehrenbach's masterpiece on the Korean War is MUST READ material for any military professional, politician and conservative.As a young officer of infantry at Benning School for Boys and the Infantry Officers Advanced Course (IOAC), every general officer that came to address the assembled classes attending Infantry Hall said, ""READ THIS BOOK!""And they were right!Fehrenbach was a high school teacher of History--now a lost art in the vaunted American public education system--and an infantry officer in the National Guard. When the war broke out, his unit was mobilized and spent the entire conflict in Korea. When the armistice was signed and his unit demobilized, he went back to teaching History and started on this excellent book. It was published in the early 60s.He's a skilled historian and an excellent writer."
1,I just wanted to adjust my brakes,This book is poorly organized. The photos are not labeled. There is an exploded view of sidepull brakes but no photo or diagram of the actual brakes and what they look like put together.There is a photo of different bikes but the labels are all black so sometimes it's hard to identify what the pointer is actually pointing to. I'm very disappointed because I just wanted to adjust sidepull and cantilever brakes and I can't figure it out from this book. I really can't tell much from the photos.I am very disappointed. I thought the revised edition would be better.
1,Old edition Bike magazine Complete guide to bicycle repair,"I made a mistake and bought this edition thinking it was the newer edition. Bicycle Magazine has updated it in 2005. This one was the 1999 edition. Some key technology has changed. If your bike is newer than 2001 or 2002, buy the new book."
2,Complete Guide to Bicycle Maintenance and Repair,It's surprising to see how much the front and back cover promise only to find out how little information and substance it actually delivers. The book is very basic providing mostly very general information. The chapter on shift levers is particularly incomplete with outdated examples and few details on maintenance and repairs. The book may suffer from trying to cover both road and mountain bikes and doing a poor job with both. Certainly won't purchase another book recommended or endorsed by Bicycling Magazine!
4,Solid Book for someone new to cycle repair,I bought this book after getting it and others to compare from the library. I found this book easy to follow and much easier to read than others.
2,Only helpful sometimes,"I had great hopes for this book. They have been repeatedly dashed. About 10% of the time I find what I need to know. Until recently, I thought the problem was me, since I'm a novice cyclist and bike mechanic. But then I discovered 'Zinn and the Art of Road Bike Maintenance'. I no longer feel stupid! I respect Bicycling Magazine, so it's a bummer that this book, which they published, is lousy."
2,"For your money, ""Zinn"" is a better book!","Like most of the other reviewers for this book, I too had high hopes for something that is published by such a big-name magazine! Unfortunately, my hopes were all shot down as soon as I needed to do some repairs that would be considered futher than the ""basics"". I felt very confused with many of the diagrams and the text just didn't make it any easier. ..."
2,Put it back on the shelf.,"I don't and won't own this book.I reviewed it carefully at my local bookstore and then returned it to the shelf.I suggest prospective buyers do the same.Material is dated and lacking in illustrative photos. Unable to find decent photos of modern brake systems.Bicycling magazine should be able to do better.Bicycles are covered extensively, but as other reviewers have stated, a great deal of detail required for repairs is missing.Revising and updating should involve more than changing the cover and/or the publication date.Currently marketed bikes such as Fischer, Trek or even Huffies have newer components, not illustrated.A good beginners book, but tough problems will still have to go to a pro shop."
2,Big Disappointment!,"I found this book to be a big disappointment! One would think with Bicycling Magazine's endorsement, that this book would be more complete. This book will get you through basic tune-ups and some maintenance, but evades the larger jobs by stating in the book to seek your local professional bicycle technician. Heck if I wanted to do that, I wouldn't need this ""flippin"" book! If all you want to do is the basic things, then this book may be for you, for me however, I do not want to go to the shop, I want to do it my self. I am returning this book for a more complete book on bicycle maintenance."
3,Bicycle Repair Manual Lacking Detail In Some Places,"I was looking for a very detailed manual for bicycle repair. This is a general book for maintenance but it fails to explore into the nitty-gritty of indiviual components.It does show how to repair and adjust various brake sets but I feel it did not depict this very well for the Shimano V brake series. Removing the freewheel and rear derailleur adjustments sections are very good.It probably could have been an excellent manual, had the authors take a little more time and went into more detail."
1,A disappointing book on Tesla,"This is not a very good book. It is simply a reprint of Tesla's early writings with some added comments and packaged to look like a new book. If you are interested in the subject, look for The Lost Journals of Nikola Tesla, which is a much better book with a lot of good info."
1,SADLY LACKING,"Lately, I have been trying to read everything I can on Tesla. I was intrigued by a special on one of the television networks. I had heard of Tesla before but didnt realize that he had accomplished so much in his life, or that he was fascinated with the signals he claimed to be receiving from outer space (possibly the planet Mars he thought). For this reason, you can imagine my disappointment on trying to gain any new knowledge from the pages of this tome. There is absolutely nothing new here. Its not even put together in a presentable format.Oh well, maybe others will get into this work. I guess I just could not!"
5,Tesla was the man!,"This book is so very interesting. Anyoneinterested in science, electricity, andthe entrepreneurial spirit should give thisbook a look!"
4,A perfectly decent show,"It is unfair to compare this show to its UK version. The UK version is a mature product with a really big budget. Watch its first couple series and you will be underwhelmed. In comparison to the first two series of Top Gear UK, this is outstanding.The cast is pretty entertaining, the show's formula works pretty well, and if they had a bigger budget, their guest stars would be better. It's nice seeing the beater used car challenges done with cars I've heard of, seen, and in some cases, owned myslef back in the day. This is a welcome improvement over the UK version. It's also nice seeing cars road tested that I could actually buy in the US.If you like cars and like to see people have fun with cars, this is a fun show. It's not high art, you will likely not roll on the floor laughing out loud the whole time, but it's plenty amusing."
1,Why bother,"It's essentially the British show without personality or imagination. Every show they're doing something that's already been done, only better, by their British elders. The hosts are boring. Adam is horrible at interviewing people and drives and talks like he's never been in a car before, let alone owned one.Watch the BBC version to be entertained, save this one to use as punishment when your teenager gets their first ticket. They'll never get another one."
3,Not Quite There,I love Top Gear....Top Gear U.K. that is. The American version would be so much better if they got better presenters. They suck. No chemistry. They aren't funny. They are annoying. The only reason I give this show 3 stars is because I am just THAT loyal of a fan of the original Top Gear.
5,Chevy,"Loved this episode, one of my favorite of the american episodes. Great banter between the guys about which truck is better."
3,its not just the budget,"its not just the budget that limits them, the newest series actually recreates challenges from a few seasons back on top gear uk, if they want to get bigger they need their own ideas and a different flavor"
1,TOPGEAR US SUCK,Nothing can compare to the original especially this trash. These guys have no chemistry between them and their jokes are extremely lame!
4,Picking up speed.,"Episode one was entertaining, I loved the Lamborghini reviews, episode two got better, and I'm looking forward to the rest of the season!"
3,Primarily for modelers,"If you're a modeler, you'll love this book. I was just looking for some info on the plane and it's history. Although that is also covered, it's not quite as in depth as I had wanted. Reviews of different A-10 model kits at the back of the book which were nice."
2,I'm disappointed,"I bought Amoflow because it was supposed to be a quality product. But the rubber nose piece fell off after 3-4 days. The lever is riveted and not secured with a screw, get's loose after a while. Not impressed."
4,nice tip,"it works as needed. yes its not made in the u.s. but for what i use it for (blowing up balls, tires) it works great."
4,Yeah Baby!,Stockholm's Hellacopters burn into the stratosphere on what must be the musical equivalent of a '68 Charger with flames on the side! 3 tracks of straight shootin' hard rockin' action in the Motorhead/Stooges vein......you owe it to yourself to own this!!!!!
2,Leaky faucet,It leaks. The provided o-ring is not sufficient to stop this. I scavenged o-rings from other faucets and the leaking stopped so it is just a poor quality seal. The base can not be screwed on tightly because it will pop off the plastic threads and loosen again. The hose is long for my sink and hard to get out of the way. $60 is way too much for this product but is it more convenient than not having one.
1,Disappointed by system canceling my order,"I'd love to say what I thought about this product, in fact I'd love to be using this product, but the system cancelled my order for the Combi filter and told me to order again some other time. There were 18 items in the inventory. Perhaps I'll order it again someday and perhaps I'll even receive one."
2,Kwikset Satin Nickel #510CExCN,"Purchased and received this item in Sep 2007 and it is everything the article describes -- a very nice looking and easy to install set. The design of this set however is questionable since it is ""overly hard to press the thumb latch to open the door"". In my opinion the thumb lever mechanism that levers the door latch itself hangs because they are improperly aligned -- nothing the installer has any control over since that is the way it is built."
4,Exact Fit (but not as good as factory part).,This part is sturdy and should outlive the car if slathered with a little grease once in a while. It is missing the cable sheath that normally rides in the draw channel and doesn't come with a stop-nut which is crucial to the installation. Easiest solution is to use your old stop nut along with the conventional nut supplied by cable mfgr and cinch the two nuts together to create the pull point. The correct way is to find a new metric stop-nut at your hardware store.
4,richard claderman romantica,"The plastic cover was cracked, but the cd was ok to play. I was pleased with the music."
2,Ok wrtten in cryon?,"I saw the author minster on Sid Roths it;s Supernatural TV show, I had high expectations in his book on FAVOR. I learned we can ask GOd for Favor, and should,But large type font and simple style was shocking, Not the book I was expecting, It was too simple and random accounts of miracles were pretty vague, Mmmmm its OK but ....lacking meat"
3,Metallica shirt,"The t-shirt material was thin, you can see through it! the screen printing wasn't top quality! all in all it was ok but the price is what got the stars low. It is a rip-off to sell this shirt and more like it, over $9.99,shipping included! they need to list the weight or ounce of the shirt! this shirt was the bare minimum.(a good quality is 100% cotton & 5.5~6 oz.and up)my opinion!"
3,a bit stale,I wasn't all that thrilled with this movie about a unknown killer plaguing a newly opened theatre and taking the faces off his victims.Mostly because the killers performance was kinda corny. The movie is ok I guess you just need to be in the rightmood to tolerate it.Some good scenes like where Tony Robertsgets skewered by the remote control mosquitobleah...
3,"Buy a bag, go home in box!","Its a well thought out story but not very well executed movie for a mainstream audience, I can see why it didn't do well in theaters. could be because they they fired and hired a different director in the middle of shooting, replaced an actress and reinserted the new actress in her scenes causing it to have production problems. Its looks to be incomplete, budget problems, scheduleing deadlines to get it rushed into post production, all the makeings that falls in the catagory of b-movie but more higher quality. Has promise but once the villain is revealed towards the end and has most of the screen time, the movie falls short with its campyness. If they had more time and a bigger budget this would be a better movie & more known. had some good ideas, it was an ok watch."
3,Fun movie marred by an awful dvd presentation,"I'm a fan of Alan Ormsby (Children Shouldn't Play With Dead Things) and was excited to see this film which he wrote the screenplay for (under the name Tod Hackett.) It's an enjoyable film, with a fondness for the good old days of crazy B movies and William Castle-esque promotional gimmicks. It's a shame though that this disc from Elite is a horrible pan and scan version. The picture quality has all the clarity of an ex-rental vhs tape. This presentation is on par with the terrible job Artisan did on Fright Night Part 2. It would be nice if Anchor Bay or Blue Underground picked up Popcorn and came out with a remastered widescreeen dvd, but until then, this will have to do."
3,not a review,"This DVD is being re-released early next year, so please do not spend 30.00 on this issue. The rerelease will also feature many special features. You can find out more about the offical release by checking out this website [...]However I can understand if you can not wait that long for this movie."
3,Interesting Find,"Here is a title that doesn't get much notice among the Jason's and Freddy's. The short version of the story involves students doing an all night horror marathon at an old movie theater that was the scene of a horrible murder 15 years ago. The crazed film maker killed his entire family on stage save for 1 daughter. Back to the present, the lead character Maggie thinks she may be the daughter that escaped, and the killer who wears other people's faces may be her father out to finish what he started. Very little blood and cursing, and no nudity. This is a more gentle horror film. I think it is worth a watch, it holds up pretty well."
5,"Buy a bag, go home in a box","Popcorn -- It gets stuck in your teeth, it makes your fingers greasy, it makes you thirsty, it's an entertaining movie about a psycho killer murdering kids at an all-night movie marathon.Before horror movies became slick and stylish, staring today's ""hottest"" actors, there were terrifying movies like ""Popcorn"". Fun, enjoyable and bloody! ""Popcorn"" is filled with the screams and jolts that you expect from a horror movie, and the powerful storyline and acting that you don't. The murders are creative and brutal, leaving you unsure of who you should cheer for - the killer, or his victims.Surprise appearances by Dee Wallace-Stone (""E.T."") and Ray Walston (""My Favorite Martian""), make ""Popcorn"" the perfect movie to watch during those chilly Autumn nights."
3,I love this movie but...,"Either the DVD I got is bad, or the people that re-mastered this piece, was a joke, everything is SO dark, even with my tv on maxed brightness, I own the VHS version, its alot clearer and less cut off angle wise, I was hoping the DVD was better quality because my VHS is slowly going bad, but anyways, very awesome slasher flick, not real scary though; not gorey either and no sexual stuff like you would see in a Friday the 13th flick, a little weird here and there, but really good in the end, definetly worth renting, or buying."
3,"Its a horror movie like ""Scream""","This movie was real great, but i dont like the acting (Wallace was boring). You should see ""Nightmare on the 13th floor"" if you want REAL horror!"
2,Corn Nothin' to SCREAM About,"Long before Wes Craven came up with ""Scream,"" this little thriller came to be. Nearly a cult classic, this chiller follows a group of people sitting through a horror marathon. Unlike ""Demons,"" this is nothing more than slice and dice slasher on the loose crapola. It does generate a few scary moments, but generates many more laughs in its lame attempt to scare us. Its fun to see fresh faces mixed in with old has been actors wondering how the heckydern they got stuck in such dribble."
2,Not as it seems.,"Before you spend mass amounts of money on this DVD, beware of a few things. Elite did a very poor job in transfering the movie on to DVD. Looks like straight transfer off video; grainy and not sharp. This DVD is also fullscreen and NOT widescreen as mentioned. Shame on Elite for giving us such a poor product to an otherwise great and classic movie."
2,*If You Like Older Horror Flicks-Maybe!*,"I love horror movies,but this movie just did not do anything for me.Some may enjoy it.It was a bit slow for me.I might just prefer some of the new horror movies alot better."
4,"Fun, Creative Schlock with a Familiar Cast","A Jamaican college campus doubles for your usual LA setting and somehow, along with a familiar cast (Jill Schoelen, Tom Villard, Tony Roberts), gives this slasher a fresh look. Not too many scares, but definitly a passable tounge in cheek horror flick if there ever was one. The late Mr. Villard (One Crazy Summer) is surprisingly under-stated and brilliant in this, in my opinion, (& I have seen other professional critics take mention of this at the time of release, despite only luke-warm reviews in general), and I'd recommend this movie for his performance alone despite the rest of the (albeit, fun) camp.I own the VHS, but I'm quite sure, despite the price, the widescreen will be worth it ..."
3,Decent,"This is a pretty entertaining film (though probably not always for the reasons the creators had in mind), especially for fans of 80's and early 90's slasher-type films. The plot is fairly simple: a group of film students put on a ""Horror, Sci-Fi, and Supernatural"" film festival in an old theater to gain recognition and raise funds, and during the evening they are killed off one by one. It manages to keep the killer and motive a secret, while tricking viewers into thinking they know who it is right away. The actors are also notable horror b-listers. It features Jill Schoelen (The Stepfather, Curse II), Dee Wallace-Stone (The Howling, The Hills Have Eyes), and Kelly Jo Minter (The Lost Boys, A Nightmare on Elm St. V, The People Under The Stairs) to name a few. The films biggest problems are a few corny moments, and the killers motives aren't very strong for killing certain people he shouldn't have a grudge against.If you're into movies like this, and have 9 bucks to blow give it a shot!"
4,Popcorn DVD,"I remember seeing this on VHS years ago and renting it several times over the years. I finally got arouns to buying it on DVD and was not disappointed. The movie is in widescreen and the sound is good, albeit not spectacular. The film shows some graininess and lines at times in the DVD, they probably could have found a better master copy, but oh well it still beats VHS. The extras aren't many, just a trailer and quite a few TV/Radio spots. But if you're looking for this movie on DVD i would definately recommend it for the fan. Whatever happened to Jill Schoelen anyways?!?"
1,This product is only 4 ounces!,"I just received my bottle of Little Sprout shampoo and I am in shock. For $9.95 plus 5.95 shipping I got a little tiny bottle that will last 3 or 4 shampoos. I don't care how good this shampoo is, it is not worth $4 an ounce!"
1,DOA,"Good idea, great price...but was DOA. The low price and the cut-to-open packaging made it too much trouble to try and return"
5,One of his early recordings,I know Stephen Fearing since I heard about the Rodeo Kings and I love his music as well as his singing. In the meanwhile I got all of his solo-recordings.
4,Rarities From Jackie Wilson,"Long out of print, this Rhino release features an excellent selection of album tracks and B-sides by vocalist Jackie Wilson. ""Through the Years"" is a solid investment if only for Mr. Excitement's smashing duets with LaVern Baker (""Think Twice"") and Linda Hopkins (""Do Lord""). Later recordings such as ""Didn't I"" and ""You Left the Fire Burning"" prove that Wilson delivered the goods when given decent material and arrangements. R&B aficionados should hunt down this hard-to-find collection."
1,Died 3 days after the 30 day warrantly.,"I had several problems from the get go with this product. I originally thought it was user error, but after the hard drive died just 3 days after the 30 day warranty, I suspect it was failing all along.I had a lot of trouble trying to see the hard drive initially on my network. Once I was finally able to see it and connect to it, it would appear at random and often freeze in the middle of reading and writing data to it.Thank goodness for Amazon's customer service. They took the product back even though it was after their 30 day return policy."
2,Unreliable,I've had this product for a few weeks now. It tends to lock up every day or so and needs to be rebooted which means the ftp access is worthless when I'm not home to reboot it.
1,wrong item,i did not receive the right item and i returned it 3 weeks ago and hasn't received my money back or any type of conformation
2,Not a good minimizer,"I was very excited to order this product based on the reviews. I was disappointed when it arrived. While comfortable to wear...minimize it does NOT. It is like wearing a regular bra. Very disappointed. If you are looking for a bra that will minimize, this isn't it."
3,"Comfy, but not minimizing...","I bought this bra after wearing the comfortable and minimizing Lilyette style #458. I thought, instead of that lacey style, ""this would look great under tight t-shirts""!I was rather disappointed. It IS seamless under most t-shirts, and VERY comfortable to wear, but not much of a minimizer. I look just as big as i really am, and my boobs don't look as perky as i thought they should. The style 458 is much, much better at these areas.One other problem. I bought this style in 34D, my usual size, but this one is bigger on the band (and a little bit on the cups, too, as a matter of fact). I ended up stiching the band smaller to fit my body. In result, i sometimes experience itchiness right where the stitches are.Overall, this bra looks nice, and feel good to wear. But not great."
3,Decent Bra,"This bra is fairly comfortable, but does not minimize as it should. There is no uplift either."
2,Lilyette Women's Minimizer Bra,"Wish I had known the straps are not completely full strap adjustable. Sent it back. Otherwise, a nice bra."
4,Love it but hard to get now,"Seems whenever I finally find a great bra, they discontinue it. Really irritating. I love it! Wish they'd keep it. It is hard for big breasted women to find comfortable and supportive bras."
5,Hard to find bra sizes,I never thought of ordering bras on Amazon so was pleasantly surprised when they had the exact item I was looking for. Fast service and the quality you would expect from Lilyette. Will definitely shop again.
5,Good Overview of Elementary Algebra Word Problems,"It's been years since I've been in a math class. This video covers all kinds of word problems-age problems, digit problems, averages, work problems,mixture and leverage. Straight and to the point, not alot of fancy editing but something that will help you understand the material. I just purchased the geometry one too. Looking forward to checking that one out as well."
4,Highly recommended,"This video does a good job of taking you through the logic of translating a word problem into a solvable equation. A bit amatuerish in places, it teaches strategies to address a wide variety of real life math scenarios."
1,This is only a picture book - no reviews!,This is a beautiful picture book of Toronto restaurants - not for the tourist who is looking for guidance through the myriad of outstanding Toronto restaurants.
5,Another OUTSTANDING entry in the VSOP series.,"Here's a rule of thumb: If it's on the VSOP label, it's going to be absolutely stellar. This title, by Vic Feldman, is no different. Lays out some of the sweetest vibe sounds you'll ever hear, and if that wasn't enough, check out the roster of cats backing him up:Frank Rosolino on trombone,Carl Perkins on piano,Leroy Vinnegar (walkin') on bass, andStan Levey on drums.It also features Harold Land on tenor. Brother, that's a dam* fine set up. And although it's got a typo on it and lists two track number six's (there are only 7 tracks on it), that's the only fault with this project - it's too short. But, if you're at all into the 50's West Coast sound, you gotta pick this up and add it to your collection right away."
2,An Everyday Physics Textbook,"This book is a fairly standard treatment of physics in which the math, though still present, has been toned way down. The ""everyday"" examples are nothing special and can be found in nearly every high school physics book. The writing and explanations are adequate, without distinction. Readers (and homeschoolers) looking for a creative, original approach to the ordinary physics textbook, packed with real-life examples, should check out ""Conceptual Physics"" by Paul Hewitt."
3,Disappointed,I enjoy Michael Buble' but was dismayed when I purchased Home and dropped it onto my CD player only to learn that it has 10 minutes of his great voice. Too much for so little.
5,KISS THE RAIN,"Well Ijust know that I loved the Kiss the Rain's song,so I would like 2 know the lyric...okay?!"
2,Doesn't stay,"It is a nice shade of purple, well represented on here. However, the clip is impossible! I have fine, shoulder length hair and no matter how much hair I try to attach the clip to, it slides out within minutes. I have not been able to wear it since I bought it. I'm sad to say it was a waste of money for me..."
1,Feeble,"All good things must come to an end, and if they don't this is what you get. Carol Ashton should have been kissed off a while back when she was still interesting. This novel is a lemon. The plot is stretched thin and is barely credible to begin with. If you want to read a good Claire McNab mystery, try the early Carol Ashton books. I should have known better than to buy this, but like a lot of readers I was hoping Ms. McNab would pull a rabbit out of the hat. Instead she gave us a turkey."
5,Great brace,The brace hold my thumb still and holds up well with washings. My tendon pain is improving with use of this brace!
1,Bulky,"Had to send this back. Was bulky, not attractive and gave me limited movement. Was quite difficult to put on."
3,UdefineU,The DVD's and printed material are very helpful. I thought the skills and techniques taught were useful and a good beginning or introduction.
4,Good death metal album.,"I got the 1994 Atomic Record version of Unearthed. A friend in highschool gave it to me, I never knew what I was getting into when I put the cd into my cd player on the bus ride home. First track Unearthed just explodes with good riffs and drums. The rest is just good death metal music all the way through, my personal favorite is ""Decrepit"". Whats kind of on the downside is the sound quality. It sounds muffled, but it fits. At first it annoyed me but I started liking it! Yes, it has a christian message. I'm catholic and I listen to all sorts of bands that have satanic or other messages that go against christian morals. Music is music! If you like it GREAT!If you like death metal or want to get into Crimson Thorn, start with this album! Very good!"
1,Sorry i don`t like this,Its too slow i mean how can anymore find such turtle like metal exciting beats me hype is defintly needed here.Why is there a debate about this band they arn`t that good seriously.all this nonsense needs to stop crimson thorn just aren`t a decent band to get into and that is the fact like it or not.
1,A sad ending,"Although I consider myself a big fan of Laurel & Hardy movies, even I couldn't stomach this one. The plot is weak, the gags are less than funny, and the boys are old and tired. What a sad exit for two of the most talented comedians of the 20th century."
4,my morning cup of coffee,"Wake up to another sunrise,lift my head,open my eyes. to think of how a wretch like me could one day live in His glory. but its a long way home cannot make it on our own. When we lack the strength to stand...reach for the nail scarred hand.The lyric touch my heart, I got to see Not ForGotten in concert and a lady next to me was in her late 70'S and believe me she had joy down in her Heart."
2,not satisfied,"This is the second TS2 transducer switch, I has bought, the first quite working, this one after installed seems to act the same way. I have not tried it out because of weather. It won't be until spring when I know for sure. The first one clicked when I first put it on, the second don't, It seems like the rubber boot puts pressure on switch and it don't click. When boot is remove the first one clicks. I'll let you know at a later date, if it works OK.[second one] Lee Huesman"
2,A/B Switch for two separate Transducers,"The switch performs as expected, switching between the trolling motor transducer and the transom mounted transducer. The whole was so small that it prevented the switch from fully engaging in position. I had to tweak the weather proof rubber cap that fits over the toggle lever by enlarging the whole in order for it to engage properly."
5,Thank you EMI Gold (UK) for this wonderful Vikki Carr CD.,"I sure would like to thank EMI Gold in the United Kingdom, for this new release ""Magic of Vikki Carr""! We are getting more and more selections that were never released on CD before. Special thanks to Martin Hutchinson for the wonderful liner notes, it's always nice to read something more current than the run of the mill liner notes. This is something that every Vikki Carr fan should buy, and I also bet that this CD will gain Vikki a new generation of fans too!"
1,"Well, ummm","I'll state up front that I do not fully appreciate the genre of music sung by Vikki Carr. I bought this album because of a single song that appears on it. Having said that, if you appreciate 1960's to 1970's lounge singer music, this album is probably for you. It's just not my taste, which makes this an unfair review.Positives: an incredibly large number of songs appear on this album--a rarity for the recording industry."
1,Rotten book,"They might as well just called the book ""I hate rosie"", it's a total waste of tree for the paper needed to print this book only donald trump could love."
1,hateful spew,this book is a disgrace...god bless you Rosie for keeping it real...finally America & the world is waking up to the fact that you actually speak the truth that no one else dares...my hero...i hate that i had to rate this pathetic excuse for a book to make my comment it deserves less than zero.....
5,Every mother-to-be must view this film,"Thank you, Ricki Lake, for getting this film made. It is an eye-opening look at the business of birth in this country and what you'll learn will shock you, challenge you, and motivate you to stand up for the rights of birthing women in this country. Absolutely a MUST-SEE."
4,very informative,This was a great documentary for someone that is looking for an alternative to the modern medical way of looking at birth. I watched it with my children to prepare them for homebirth.
5,Excellent Documentary!,"This is a wonderful documentary, anyone anticipating pregnancy, pregnant, or planning children in the future should watch. Highly recommended watch, this totally changed my perspective on childbirth and pushed me into the direction of midwifery with my second child."
3,eye opening,"This movie asks alot of the questions that expectant parents going through the hospital ""system"" are afraid to ask. How many things they do at the hospital are really necessary? Why has the number of c-section births grown enormously over the past decade? Whatever happened to a natural birth? While this is definitely a look at the extreme of the different choices that are out there for expecting, the important part that comes across is that there are choices. I would recommend this for anyone who is expecting (whether it's your first or not), or anyone who has been through the hospital ""system""."
1,Business of Being Misled,"I decided to research child birth delivery for my pregnancy. I've studied various methods and am trying to be very obejective in my research as I want to have the best experience for myself and my child. When I first watched this, I found this documentary intriguing. But after doing additional research, I began to feel misled. Why should I fear the hospital? I combed the internet and came across this article written by a woman who is a doula, I liked what she had to say. If you are like me, and want a lot of perspectives and research before making a decision as important as childbirth, then I strongly recommend you read this article. doula dani's blog is called ""what ifs and fears welcome"". And her article is called ""the business of being misled"". (Sorry couldn't post URL link here)."
5,A must see for every pregnant woman!!,"I love this documentary and I have everyone I know that is pregnant watch this! It is so informative, I really wish I would have watched it before I had my first baby. Women don't realize they have options and they are in charge of there own births, we don't just have to go along with the what the Dr. says.......ie.....""let induce,"" ""lets give you pitocin to speed up your labor,"" ""Lay flat on you back and put your feet in the stirups""(actually the worst possible position to give birth in, it's just convient to the Doctor).......I could go on and on. Doctors want to over medicalize the most natural and beautiful thing on earth.....it's so sad. Birth can be the most amazing and impowering thing a women can go through in her life, but thanks to modern day medicine, it's lost it's appeal. Please watch this video, you will be glad you did....especialy if this is your first baby. Give yourself and your baby the most precious gift of all!"
2,Ricky Lake? Really?!,"Since when was Ricki Lake a reputable or respected journalist?! Since never. She's ridiculous. She produced this documentary and it is ridiculous. This is a completely one sided documentary. It presents a lot of opinions as though they are facts, and seems to try to demonize women for making the choice to have a ""traditional"" hospital birth.That being said I do think women should be educated about the processes and facts of giving birth, which this film sort of does. In a totally biased, opinion-based, limited facts way. It confirmed my beliefs of disagreeing with home births 100%. The goal should be to have women make an educated choice that's right for them, not a baised choice that's what Ricki Lake wants, as this documentary would have women do."
2,Too graphic for my taste,"I thought this is a video about how a child is born. It isn't. It's a video about the birthing industry in the US, with a few live births thrown in. The documentary is biased towards home births, suggesting that hospital births are unnecessary except in emergency cases. It also suggests that hospitals are profit driven, and often perform excessive procedures to increase their profits. Basically, this video does not describe birth, it describes the business side of birth. Good if you're undecided between hospital and home birth, but not good if you, like me, were looking for a scientific documentary instead.I give it only two stars because I was very turned off by the graphic nature of the births filmed. The women are naked, and the camera is at the business end. I can't share this with my husband because he'll be traumatized!"
5,No surprises,"I watched this before giving birth to my first born. I had no idea what to expect with the birthing process or what I wanted. This video, while a bit strongly biased towards home birth, didn't hold back. They showed everything - and that's exactly what I needed. After watching this, not only did I want a home birth, but I knew it would be painful, and I knew I had the strength to do it! I love this video and give it to everyone as a must watch when they become pregnant the first time."
4,From a father's perspective,"Overall I think the information provide in the movie was good, albeit the way it was presented was not always ""polished"" (e.g., some nudity and profanity), but it was certainly honest. My wife wanted me to watch this with her as we are having our second child in April 2009. When our daughter was born in June 2006, we had the negative experience many women expressed in the film about the hospital experience. We planned for a natural birth and ended up having multiple interventions including a c-section which was not what we wanted at all, and may not have been necessary at all with a home birth situation. I would recommend this film to those parents to be out there, especially first time ones, to seriously consider home birth and to trust your natural, God given instincts."
2,Totally Biased,This movie is very biased and uses emotional tactics to scare pregnant women. I couldn't even watch the whole thing.
5,Very informative,Every pregnant woman and every woman planning pregnancy should see this movie. Women today have been conditioned to believe we are much weaker than we are.
1,Uses Wrong Statistics To Frighten You,"This video uses Infant Mortality Rates (IMR).Infant Mortality is the death of an infant within the first year of life. This is a reflection of Pediatric Care, not Obstetric Care.Perinatal Mortality Rates would be the accurate statistic to use. It calculates deaths from 28 weeks gestation through the first week postpartum. This would be a true reflection of obstetrical and/or midwifery care in the United States.When someone purposefully uses misleading statistics to make their point, they are essentially lying to you. It doesn't matter what field it is regarding, whether politics, law, or medicine.I'm not saying all women should give birth in a hospital. The mother should do what is right for her and her family and should be informed before making her choice.What I am saying is that this video should not be used as a source of that information/education."
4,Loved it...,"This documentary should be watched by anyone pregnant, or considering becoming pregnant.Make sure you have a tissue box next to you when watching!"
4,good to watch before or while pregnant,My husband and I watched this movie the other night. It is long. It is good at stressing how screwed up maternity care is in the U.S. I think it is a little too political.
3,Worth watching,"The video was a little disappointing, but definitely worth watching (Especially at the recently slashed price). Overall, I think it was great to see the other side of things, but there were a few things that I found off putting. Mostly it was the commentary by one of the people interviewed--she seemed ignorant and was stating a few things that simply weren't true (but were her opinion). The other thing I found unacceptable was at the very end when the director went into pre-term labor and didn't even call her doctor. I know she was at the cusp of when doctors would try stopping early labor (36/37 weeks), but even that early, babies can have problems breathing on their own or other issues. I thought it was really irresponsible of her to include her vignette in the video-- I found it discredited everything Ricki was trying to prove."
5,Definitely worth a watch,"If you're due to have a baby any time soon, I would definitely recommend watching this film as a way to kickstart your research into the type of birth that you want to have."
3,Revelatory,This video opened my eyes a little bit more to the way that consumerism has reached it's ugly hands into the wonder of child birth. I don't agree with all of the material presented in the movie but I do appreciate a new view of this area of healthcare in America.
5,Wonderful Documentary,"This documentary is insightful and informative. It has changed the way I look at birth and how I want to labor. I recommended it to all women, pregnant or not."
4,Excellent documentary,"Excellent documentary informing of the realities of hospital vs. home birth. Just wish they included a review of birthing center alternatives, instead of pointing so heavily to home birth. But this video definitely opened my eyes and mind to the option of home birth, and my husband's as well. Definitely recommend couples watch together."
4,"Good content, but...","I found The Business of Being Born to be very informative and definitely worth watching, I highly recommend it. I have only a couple complaints:1. A bit of nudity towards the end, my husband and I would've appreciated more modesty.2. There's a lot of talk of ""empowerment"". *gag*"
1,Shocked,"I'm shocked at the inaccuracies and generally uninformed opinions that comprise the formative argument of this video. While midwives can provide a comfortable alternative to the common hospital birth for those who might desire it, this doesn't make physicians the enemy. There's nothing to be gained or learned from watching this video, don't waste your time or money."
3,Outrageous reality - pathetic approach,"Surely in this day and age the consumer is aware enough to understand that a documentary should in best case present an unbiased view of a situation.So why is it that films like this are being made?LET ME ASSURE YOU THE ISSUES THAT ARE PRESENTED ARE EXTREEMLY IMPORTANT AND VALID!! However that way in which it is presented is going to frustrate anyone who likes to come to their own conclusions with out being beaten into the presenters point of view. I feel that this film could potentially harm the cause, by compounding the already existing stereotype of the hard arse and slightly ignorant feminist radical... Come on people let the facts to do the talking and grow the hell up..."
5,Great set!,"I love this set! I've been moving from plastic storage to more glass storage, and this set is so versatile. I can use it for mixing one day, and then switch to storage the next! The biggest bowl is probably my favorite. I finally have an air tight container big enough to store my big pasta salads and soups! Definitely a great set!"
5,Pyrex rules!,"I got this for a super low price and having already had a set, I knew I could use the lids. Well, I was right.....I have 2 sets. 8 bowls total, but only 4 covers which is all I need and I don't know how I managed without them before!!! Pyrex takes a beating, that's for sure and they keep their shine and newness."
1,Shattered after being used in the microwave,"These bowls are advertised as being microwave-safe, but that hasn't been my experience.I used the smallest bowl to melt some butter in the microwave. After pouring the melted butter over popcorn in a different bowl, I put the little bowl in the dishwasher to sit until I had enough dishes to run a load. A few minutes later, there was this huge popping sound.Yep, the bowl shattered to pieces. I was incredibly lucky that this happenend in a contained space. I would hate to think what could've happened if the bowl had been sitting on the counter instead of in the dishwasher! Fortunately, the dishwasher was almost empty at the time so nothing else got damaged.It took me about an hour to get all the pieces out of the dishwasher. I use the remaining bowls to store food in the fridge, but I never again intend to expose glass to high temperatures. I now melt butter in a saucepan on the stove, instead of the microwave."
1,Loved them initially but...,"I purchased these bowls because I needed more prep and storage bowls with lids. These seemed to fit the bill perfectly. However, a month or so after I had the set I was taking them out to use them and barely tapped one of them against the plastic shelf and it exploded. Thinking this was a freak accident I continued using them. Yesterday the same thing happened with another one (total product age approximately 6 months). They had not been heated, cooled etc. 2 bowls exploded with very little impact after sitting on a shelf. As a matter of fact these were rarely microwaved and mostly used for fridge storage. Very disappointed!"
5,8piece Pyrex,I am switching all my plastic out for glass. Thought these bowls would be a nice substitute for some of my plastic storage bowls. They are! They nest well and are a great investment. I have Pyrex that's not showing any wear that is over 30 years old and hope these last equally as long. My only negative is I was recently in Target and they had them for $+/-5.00 less with an additional 20% off. My Amazon purchases normally beat store prices and this was somewhat of a surprise. I'll start checking locally now 'before' I order on-line. I still give it a 5 star rating b/c I think the product is great although not happy with the price.
1,Bowl Exploded,"I received this set for Christmas 2007. I have used them and enjoyed them for 8 months. Yesterday, I heated some soup in the microwave in the smallest bowl. Let it cool and ate some of it. About 10 minutes later I put the lid on the bowl and put it in the refrigerator. The soup and bowl were room temperature. The next morning when we opened the refrigerator, the bowl was in pieces and the soup was all over the shelf. There were no cracks in the bowl before I used it. I have now read hundreds of other people's experiences with the same issue. I will be taking this product back to the store. IT IS UNSAFE. Here is the consumer affairs [...]"
3,"Good, but heavy as storage containers","I bought them b/c I wanted to get some pyrex storage containers. These are good as I can also use them for mixing, salad and I love the wide range of sizes. The only problem I have is they are very heavy. Otherwise, no issues."
3,Missing a bowl,"Be careful. When I picket up this product from Target, it was short one bowl, the 2.5 quart. Since the smaller ones are pretty much useless anyway, I more or less threw $10 away."
4,love them,"I love these bowls. The quality and durability of Pyrex is always awesome and these bowls live up to that. The lids are very convenient, easy to store, and easy to get on and off. I love that they nest for storage, but it is difficult to get the smaller bowls out when they are nested. The rims flare out (for the lid fitting) leaving very little space for your fingers to grab the rim to pull the bowl out. I have very small fingers so I can get them out, but I have to use both hands--not a big deal, but a little annoying if my hands are full and I just need to grab a bowl really quick. That said, I still love these bowls and would definitely recommend them."
4,Great Cooking Accessories,These bowls meet the Pyrex quality standards. They are solid and the lids add a whole new storage dimension to the variety of possible utilities. I bought these for my sister-in-law as a Christmas gift and will likely be purchasing them shortly for my wife.
5,Pyrex got it right!,"This is one of those items I found by accident and would buy over again if necessary, The bowls are typical clear Pyrex and a nice heavy quality to each one. The lids make this the perfect set of mixing bowls. You can make ahead and pop into the fridge and it will not dry out with the lid on. Love these!"
5,Mixing Bowls,"Very simple and just what we wanted. I love pyrex products, and we love that they are made in the USA."
4,Very useful,"I use these bowls all the time. They are very heavy when they're all stacked together but it is nice to store so many in a small space. Be sure to wash the covers by hand or in the top rack of the dishwasher (if they fit) because they may warp otherwise. If you avoid warping the covers, they seal very well - I often toss salad by covering the salad and dressing in the bowl and shaking it upside down!"
5,Perfect set of bowls,"I chose these bowls to replace my old mixing bowls mainly because of the lids. Because this set comes with lids, the bowls can do double-duty as both mixing bowls and food storage containers. I've also used them to bring food to parties. The lids fit well and are labeled with the bowl capacity. The bowls have all the benefits of being Pyrex, meaning they're glass with no chemicals, can be microwaved, don't absorb smells/food, etc. There are 4 sizes in the set, so one is always appropriate for whatever you're doing. They nest within each other, so they don't take up too much space in the cabinet."
5,Great set,This is a great set. I can use it in the microwave. And I can also use the plastic lids to save the leftovers in the fridge. I've had my set for a while now and I suspect they'll last for years to come.
5,Pyrex bowl set,Nice glass bowls that stack for easy storage. Use them all the time. Doesn't hold smells like plastic containers and is microwavable. Makes a great gift also.
5,One of my favorites,"I have read this several times and have given this book as a gift to many of my friends. A great ""dramatic"" telling of the Lover of our souls chasing after us!! Great reminder of just how loved we really are!!"
3,Fails to Expand.,"Being a student of theatre, acting, and the movies I really was looking forward to reading this book. I figured anything that would compare the Gospel and my life to the form of a play would have to be interesting. Unfortunately, THE DIVINE DRAMA wasn't as interesting as I thought it would be. It takes the story of the Gospel, simplifies it, and puts it into the form of a story. It makes a simple comparison of the Divine Drama to that of a play being written, but it doesn't really expand upon that premise. Nor does it in depthly explain how our lives are like scenes in a play.With that said, the book is a decent read and would prove very interesting for someone who has never thought about comparing the Gospel story to a play or even one's life to a drama. However, if you really want to explore the similarities of life, Gospel, and drama read Frederick Buechner's TELLING THE TRUTH: THE GOSPEL AS TRAGEDY, COMEDY, AND FAIRY TALE or C.S. Lewis' GOD IN THE DOCK."
4,Beautifully sung old fashioned hymms,"These hymms display the essence of true biblical singing....nothing entertaining or fancy, just one's soul singing to God. All are well recorded and arranged. No drums or electric guitars here. I strongly recommend to any who are concerned about today's CCM and prefer the Old hymms of the faith."
4,"Good, though not the best","While rather pricey, this collection of short stories is quite charming, and well worth the money, if you're a true die-hard fan, and/or are into comics in particular. I never have been, (into comics, that is) but this caught my eye one day at the last minute in the bookstore, so I picked it up just for the heck of it. And I have to say, that I enjoyed it quite a bit as a whole. Some of the spoofs were really silly, (as in, not worthy of Star Wars) but most everything else was great, the story detailing Padme's first boyfriend was sweet, and the one about Darth Vader and Threepio almost had me in tears. So, I'd recommend this one to anyone with a reasonable amount of EU experience, and a good sense of humor. Good for all ages."
2,This is the least of the first 3 volumes of SW Tales,"This collection of 21 stories has some of the worst pencil artwork produced by Darkhorse in the last 3 years. The stories were readable, but a comic is a visual form first and formost, and this one is has many poorly done and some horrendously done art. Some of the art seems like it is trying recapture the style of the 1970s and 1980s comic strips. Please don't retro back to that era intentionally! Especially since the art and inking of comics has moved forward into some awesome creations in the last several years.At 224 pages and given Dark horse poor binding technics of late be careful anything this big. My copy was OK. The stories and artwork in this compilation is not up the quality of other Dark Horse comic TPB offering lately."
4,Fun stuff,A lot of small stories that give a little (not much) background to the movies. Entertaining.
5,"THE NEW RELEASE, CALLED ""NIGHTSONGS""","This artist is a truly beautiful lady, with so much love in her heart-- clearly she wants to show the world and lead them into a higher conciousness of the love and healing of 'the universal life force' as she states, to come into the fullness of your own beauty,life, to feel really alive, express, and experience!! There is much that can be experienced from'Nightsongs."" Truly this album is one of the great poetic triumphs of our times, and I rejoice in the gift Janet is giving the world, which is ,simply to be brought into that special state where everyone wants and yearns to be in- one of love, oneness with the creative life force, the magic and the healing power of love, experiencing your emotions, feelings, and the great joy just to be alive. To feel alive in the many deep ways Janet speaks of in her own words and experiences on ""Nightsongs"" is a priceless, beautiful gift to the world, not to be missed!!!"
2,great sex scenes ... terrible story,"I bought this movie based on the first review and because I liked Helen Lesnick's previous movie ""A Family Affair."" I was very disappointed with ""Inescabable."" I have to admit that the sex scenes were great, but that really doesn't make up for the poor acting and an even worse story. Try to rent it before you decide to buy it."
1,I wanted to escape the theatre,"I saw this at a film festival and it was truly, truly, awful. The lighting was dim-to-none. The acting was horrifying. The story was blech. Interminable. Stay away!"
2,Not that great!,"This movie is really weird! I was dissapointed, but at the same time i've seen worse. I have never watched it again, nor has my girlfriend who actually fell asleep while we were watching it. Also she can't watch a lesbian movie if she doesn't think at least one of the girls are hot, and she didn't think any of them were. It's kind of slow moving with not a whole lot of dialogue. It ends strange and after it's over you are wondering why the hell you wasted 2 hours watching this. The shower scene is kind of hot though, although from the reviews I expected better! I wouldn't watch,not buy this movie again, and my girlfriend wasn't even phased by finding out what she missed in the movie."
3,"Interesting, but flawed nonetheless","This video was neither great nor awful. I kind of liked the sub/dom element of the two women involved, having their affair under the noses of their lesbian life partners. But it wasn't so great that I would heartedly recommend it. I wouldn't mind seeing further efforts by these actresses and producers with a little more eroticism thrown in."
5,Great voice and talent,"Noelia, te deseo lo mejor en tu carrera como cantante. Sin duda, llegaras muy lejos con tu talento y sencillez. Recomiendo este disco a todos aquellos que comparten el sentimiento del amor. Me encata la cancion #1, Tu, es muy romantica y llega hasta el fondo de nuestros corazones. Good luck Noelia!"
3,Promising debut of Yolandita Monge's daughter,"Being the daughter of a legendary singer usually brings critics regarding the talent of the mom or dad vs. the son or daughter.Noelia sings quite similar to her famous mom(who started as a child singer in Puerto Rico), specially in Yolandita's early recordings. I hope she has a long and triumphant stay in the charts and well written/produced songs in her future albums."
3,so far.. ook,"I just got this cd today after reading all comments. I haven't had tons of time to delve into the meaning and sound of every song. THere is a lot of variety in this cd. Some songs are very salsarific (word?) and some are ballads and some are techno dancable rhythms. I agree with the others. She sounds a lot like Thalia in a lot of songs. Her best songs so far are Tu, Candela and I like the rhythm in Jurame. CHeck this cd out. Good luck to Noelia."
4,Promising NEW!!! Puertorrican Star,"Excelent ballads, Excellent voice... Hope to see more from her soon.."
5,Excellent.,"Excellent. Mastering Algorithms with Perl starts off with basic language optimizations and then becomes an inexhaustible tome of algorithms, including: quick-sort, prime-number generation, computing derivatives and integrals, solving multiple non-linear equations and cubic equations... the list goes on. A must-read for anyone doing production work with Perl."
4,Insightful book,I bought this book as a christmas gift for a friend who is interested in IS type stuff. So far he says he is enjoying the book and learning a lot. Glad I got it for him.
5,The second Perl book you should read!,"If you are relatively new to Perl programming, then you have probably already read ""Learning Perl"". Other reviewers may disagree with me, but ""Mastering Algorithms with Perl"" is the very next book you should read. This book takes the scattered pieces of the grammar of Perl and starts you on the path of understanding the prose of Perl. You learn why references are so important. You absorb the idioms of Perl programming in a manner that makes them second nature. Also, you have a ready reference for many other tasks you may find yourself working with. Buy this book. Then, you can move on to other O'Reilly Perl books with confidence."
1,"Okay book, bad language & subject matter","Perl is a great language which I have used every single day since Perl 3, but it is not the ideal tool for testing algorithms & their speed. While the algorithm ideas are applicable to any language, the Perl code is not portable (specially with Perl's particular syntaxis). This book tries to be like ""Numerical Recipes for C"" but falls short on both subject matter. If you are an average to decent Perl Hacker, the material in this book will still be useless to you and probably put you to sleep quickly since you \won't get it. If, on the other hand, you are math student or scientist, the book will also have make you yawn, since you'll have already seen the examples before and in a much more clear & portable language: C."

1,It's okay.,"This game does nothing but cheat. The game consistently strings multiple turns for itself, bashing in your hitpoints like a barbarian at the gates of... some place they ransacked, I dunno. I got up, made a sandwich, came back, and it still wasn't my turn.Oh, wait, let me explain this game for you. It's ""Bejeweled."" With magic. You cast a spell and ding the enemy and then it casts a hundred spells and you die. And then you repeat. And sometimes you're unfortunate enough to win and continue the horrible plot, which only forces you to play more matching games against the computer.It's so hood.If you're really in the mood for a good puzzle game, get something else. I highly recommend ""Guess Who."""
1,Four Star Game in a One star port,"Looks worse than the other version, and if you have an Xbox 360 you can get a better looking version of the same exact game for only $10. This version is really a joke. The control setup is totally messed up as well. Don't waste your money...."
1,Terrible Port,"Get another version. The controls are terrible (both control options), the audio is glitchy and the text is barely readable without a digital TV. It's not the Wii's fault, this is shoddy programming."
1,worst game ever,"OMG! What a horrible game! I wish Amazon would allow a score of 0. Where to start? First the graphics just plain suck. Very difficult to read. Controllers, sucky again. The game does not use the Wii remote properly, difficult to move around the game and difficult to make moves in the short games. Why bother making a game for the Wii if you don't take advantage of the technology the system has to offer. Music, thankfully it can be turned off! Horrible port waste of money. I feel very ripped off and am taking the game to a used game store after owning it for less than 24 hours. Wish I would have read the reviews here and not been attracted to it at Best Buy."
1,Huge disappointment,"I eagerly anticipated PuzzleQuest for the Wii.Everything said in the previous review echoes my experience with this game. It's hard to stress enough the difficulty I had reading the text on screen - it made me dizzy and I was only able to play for a short time. The controls don't work well, so you lose points and die making moves you didn't really make.This was an exercise in frustration and a waste of money. They should have spent more time and actually made it Wii friendly. Grrr. This gives the abomination of a game called Chicken Shoot"" fierce competition for worst Wii game."
3,Don't get for Wii unless TV is HUGE,"This game is pretty fun.. It's very similar to Bejeweled but with a little twist. The only issue is that if you get this game for Wii, the text on a majority of the screens is physically impossible to read. I'm not sure how it works on other systems. I had a 27"" TV and could NOT read the words. I recently upgraded to a 50"" flat screen and it's still not the easiest read in the world, but it's legible now. If you like Bejeweled with a plot, this game is for you."
1,Rent it- dont buy it,"I love puzzle type games and RPGs so why not buy it?The graphics are terrible, there is alot of reading, and at this point I dont get what to really do with the game, its not a very fun game and I think Ill be turning this one into the used game store."
4,looks great,They look great. Easy too install. Not too sure how the double sided mounting tape will hold up in the Las Vegas heat tho.
1,Does Not Fit,This Part # does not fit the 2005 Toyota 4 Runner as indicated.Give the supplier credit for processing a quick return.
2,Different formula.,I bought the 6.7oz Fahrenheit from Amazon. I thought the formula was off so I purchased a new bottle from Christian Dior directly. There is a BIG difference. The Amazon formula has a sharp bitter scent and the Dior one is the original formula that I have used for years. This is the second time being burned on fragrances from Amazon. Buy from a department store to avoid the discrepancies.
2,Wrong item,"I ordered this perfume but the 3.4 ounces, i had it before and it smells pretty good a must buy the thing is that they sent me the wrong item a white bottle! Very disappointed but im not gonna waist my time returning it! Next time i'll go to a store"
5,Phenominal scent,"As the other review says, you either love it or hate it. And while he's in the latter, I'm definately in the latter. And not only that, pretty much any girl I've known loves it too - my wife describes it as ""sex in a bottle"" and let's face it, that's why we wear the stuff in the first place."
3,Bottle looks like a knock off...,"""Seller describes the product as new, but the name ""Fahrenheit"" printed on the bottle is faded and crooked. Being a longtime consumer of this cologne I couldn't smell any difference between this and older bottle. The fragrance is fine but the bottle looks like a knock off."""
2,Plastic Shed Makes Me Angry,"My two year old son plays with the set for hours on end while my six month old daughter looks on. However, the yellow plastic shed is impossible to assemble and falls apparent every three minutes. My recommendation is to forego this particular set in favor of one that doesn't have the yellow shed."
5,Excellent Read!!,Love this book kept me on the edge on every Chapter I read. One of my favirote books recommend this to reads that love suspense.
5,Love the Lovin Touch,Dick Summer has caught the essence of love in these short verses. The metaphors used allows us to use all of the senses as we listen. Although written many years ago the touch of love does not change. Relax and be drawn into the emotion that being in love evokes.
5,Could be mistaken as aural sex...,"But it really is high fidelity eroticism. Not the sexuality of a four color monthly read only for the articles but the sensuality of a mahogany table top with four generations of hand rubbed polish. Dick's blend of prose and music creates a level of anticipation that becomes it's own reward, a wistful recollection of romantic synergy that, if you're incredibly lucky, repeats itself for the rest of your life."
5,"""Day by Day"" Everyday!","The least I can say is this CD is GREAT! The first time I heard the title track ""Day by Day"", I was singing along with the words. It is one of those songs you find yourself singing for the rest of the day. Between the positive message and the variety of music, you won't be able to get enough of this CD...and I haven't even mentioned the excellent vocals! I swear I could hear the likes of Alanis Morissette and Bette Midler throughout this CD! I strongly recommend this album. It will add energy to your day and remind you of the Holy presence that guided this album's production!"
5,A great compliment to the first album.,"Jordi's second album makes a great compliment to his first album. The music alone is wonderful and his songs are filled with life and love. This is definately an album for the daytime, while the first album is for night. A must have for any fan of artistic latin music."
5,A fascinating look at standup,"As an up-and-coming standup comedian, I found this movie to be extremely interesting. As great as Jerry Seinfeld's ""Comedian"" was, this movie really digs deep into the life of a comedian. Clearly, standup is not for everyone, but those who do it (generally) absolutely love it. The movie talks with such greats as Tim Allen, Tom Arnold, Roseanne, Sarah Silverman, Bobcat, Jeff Foxworthy, and more. They share how they got started, hecklers, and those horrible gigs that every comedian dreads. If you're thinking of a life of standup, you may first want to look at this film. However, even if you just like standup and can appreciate what they do, you'll also enjoy this movie."
3,OUTDATED SCIENCE AND THEORIES,100'th monkey theory has been disproven. Apparently monkeys are just plain smart. Especialy when a few monkeys from the other Island were put on that 100'th monkey Island and the other monkeys picked up on the potato washing.
1,Buyer Beware -- Wastes ink for no good reason,"Brother 1800C fax has color ink tanks beside black ink, but they are never used since I only receive b&w fax.The color ink cartridges dry up on their own (about twice in the last 6 months) and the machine will stop printing fax entirely unless you replace the color cartridges.This enables Brother to make a lot of money on ink replacement, but doesn't necessarily present good value for endusers.Paper handling is subpar. The fax jams more frequently than other fax machines I've ever used.In short, save your money and annoyance, buy something else."
2,eats ink!!!,"I bought this item 6 months ago. I have had to replace the color ink cartridges over 3 times and I don't even use it to copy or fax color documents. The worst is when it ""runs out"" of ink you can not even send out a black fax until you replace the cartridges.....Urghhhhhhh. the ink is $30 per cartridge (total 3color + black). The funny thing is the black has only needing changing once while all the colors have had to be changes 3-4 times!!! I only use the fax (black only) 3-4 times a week. Do not buy this machine.only plus: fast fax of documents, quality average from what I have seen in other ink jets"
1,Ditto to all the bad,"So I've had this machine for at least 8 years. I fax maybe twice a year and print maybe once a month -- We're talking 10 pages per month total usage max. I spend(t) tons on ink because cartridges kept emptying monthly with just very little usage. Every time I did want to use it, I'd have to wait for the 'CLEANING' cycle to finish first. Terrible!! It finally broke on me yesterday with a '41' error code. The most pleasure I will get out of this machine is throwing it away. First an last Brother product purchase.One thing not mentioned, the paper supply area (tray if you will) in the back doesn't support the paper properly and it constantly jams. I mean every time. Even with the supplied additional plastic and corkboard support piece thingy. You basically have to manually feed the sheet one at a time or hold on to the stack so it only pulls one sheet at a time.This product is junk plain and simple."
5,This is a serious book,"Change is not easy to accept and the greater one's conviction about a certain way of observing the universe - religious, scientific, political, and such - the more difficult to accept radical new ideas.The Earth was flat, the sun revolved around the Earth, gay marriage would never occur, Communism would always exist, the one-minute mile could not be broken, and on and on.Freddy Silva, in both this book and the sequel a decade later, illuminates an extraordinary set of possibilities for our planet. And Silva is no guru attempting to elicit a following or to have you 'convert'. It is the most intriguing and provocative experience I have been exposed to in many decades.Silva has a great and subtle sense of ironic humor that buffers the intensity of his presentation.I am reading each of these for the second time. ."
4,Believe it or not it's very interesting,"This was a fascinating book that provided alot of information not just about crop circles but other topics as well including sacred geometry, history, and other cultures. Whether you believe the crop circle phenomenon or not this book is still very interesting and informative and might just open your mind to other possibilities. I liked that the book does not necessarily need to be read cover to cover but rather you could open to any page, like I did, and find yourself engrossed. I must admit that I found the scientific data to be rather compelling and would recommend this book to anyone who wants an alternative view to the conventional thought that crop circles were made by humans."
4,"Good book, not strongly documented scientifically","A lot of loose mathematics, still wondering what are 'energy upwells' on every planet (and why is it at 20 degrees latitude?). Author seems to claim that circles in US are either: 1) roped off by police tape 2) destroyed by farmers for mysterious cash payments 3) not a nation interested in esoteric knowledge. A good read overall."
2,Secrets of the fields by,"I was very disappointed in this book!The author had all the professional people and resources under its finger tips, and blow its chance to write the best book on this subject.This book contained lots of data, and the rest was spent on those two guys who claimed that they have done the crop circles them self.By the way the people around the world well informed and aware that the governments of the world covering up UFO activities. The Spiritual light workers educating the people about the mysteries of the universe true out the ages.What I was hoping to read from your book to decode each crop circle from the geomantic point of you, and also you had a physic present who cod have given you a deep profaned information who are the crop circle makers and they massage to human kind.With Love & LightRozalia Balazsirozalia1@optusnet.com.auwww.akashicrecords-tarot.com"
2,Suitable for beginners (perhaps),"BALLROOM DANCING - Chris Kalogerson & OrchestraExperienced ballroom dancers, read no further--this CD is not for you. The tempo on most of these selections is painfully slow, suitable for beginner's practice. One can almost hear the dancer counting ""1-2-3"" in the waltz (85 BPM), or ""slow-slow-quick-quick"" on the fox-trots. The Latin selections lack the fire and energy associated with this type music. On the two rumba selections (Spanish Eyes & Day in the Life of a Fool) the tempo is OK. On the cha-chas the rhythm is understated, and difficult for an inexperienced dancer to follow. A tip-off should be that this CD has ""Dance Instructions Enclosed."" Descriptions of the basic step of seven dances (with numbered foot-diagrams) is enclosed. A novelty is the inclusion of the ""Butterfly"" dance word-description. Track # 8, ""Little Brown Jug,"" is labeled ""Butterfly,"" and has the expected repeated changes of tempo from 3/4 to 2/4."
5,Love Swarovsky!,This is a pair of very pretty and well-made earrings that match a ring I already have. I love the leverback clasps--no worry of losing an earring.
4,A nice book on how to market successfully,"This book has a very nice personal touch, you feel that the author is talking to you the whole time. His enthusiasm is also very contagious and you feel excited to carry out his advice right away.This book focuses on an 'out of the box' approach to marketing. It is filled with a lot of the author's own experiences with the Portland Trail Blazer, New York Nets, the Edmonton Oilers, etc. and how he went about to turn their businesses around. He points out the problem of bland marketing, the power of giving crazy ideas a try, the need to have a revenue-centric mentality, and the desire to produce immediate results. All these points are also reviewed after every chapter and are organized very nicely near the end of the book for a final review.The strength of this book is very enjoyable to read and it really makes you want to achieve the same kind of success the author has. Happy reading!"
4,Outrageously Refreshing,"There are many great marketing ideas in this book. Even more valuable is the conditioning to think differently or even outrageously.Here are just a couple thing I'm taking with me:Write on a card ""what will it take for me to________________?"" Fill in the blank with your really big goal. Carry that card with you always and often think about the question and possible answers.On the other side of that same card write ""what did I do today to make money for my company?"" Think about that question continually until you get in the habit of creating revenue daily. Spoelstra's suggestion is to make at least one sales call every day. Whether or not you are in sales, this will help the company, help you, and teach valuable lessons."
3,24 f p/s?,"The movies are masterpieces, the prints are gorgeous, the black and white is well contrasted and shines, the soundtracks are ok... but, one major doubt. On these dvds the movies run at 24 f p/s (or 25? these dvds are NTSC?). Nobody will convince me that this is the same projection speed used at the time. Ok, we all know that projection speed varied, that the projectionist would decide it, and so on. But: at 24 f/s all seems speeded up. And it's very annoying. I guess 20 or even 22 f/s would have been a more respectful choice. Of course, at 20 f/s the soundtracks wouldn't have been synchronised: so, it has been more easy to have 24 f/s for any of these silent films, and what the hell!"
3,mediocre,Hmmm...disappointing somehow even though its still the same happy-peppi musical mish-mash than the previous albums. This album is just not as original and catchy. It's almost annoying to listen to the whole album- too sweet. The hard-core Pizzicato 5 fan is gonna get what he's looking for but for the rest : just record this album from a friend!
4,good album but...,"This is a good album, solid Pizzacato five music, but compared to Happy End of the World it is a little flat, and not quite as fun. Of course it may just be played the other recording to death, and had high expectation for this one."
2,yawn....,"Haines is a poet and in this book aspires to describe his experiences with poetic sounding prose:""Six o'clock on a January morning. I wake, look into the darkness overhead, and then to the half-lighted windows. I listen. No sound comes to me from the word outside. The wind is quiet. I get out of bed, pulling the stiffness from my body."" Boooring...."
1,Did we all read the same book?,"This was unreadable. If you are looking for a well-written account of living in the wilderness you should read ""Arctic Homestead"". Now there is a book you will not want to put down. The author of the Stars, Snow, and Fire spent twenty-five years in the Alaska wilderness without an editor to keep him focused. He was probably paid by the number of "","" he used in this book. There was no flow and the constant use of "",s"" gave me a headache. Some will say I do not appreciate poetic writing. I appreciate anything, which is well written which this book was not."
1,POOR QUALITY ALL ROUND,"This was a huge dissapointment. It started at the very begining when the first screen warns you that the quality of the material does not match todays standards. Naturally you'll find this out only after you open the wrapper. In fact the picture and sound quality were extremely poor.Secondly I have serious reservations about the people who put these movies together. The children are dressed and act as if directed by Pedophiles. Whats with the underpants, bare legs etc As a mother of a three year old I was appalled. Not to mention the racist casting; all the toddlers of color were either maids, servants or porters. I don't care if this was a sign of the times, its still very insulting. This one WILL NOT grace our TV screen again as I 'd hate to send the wrong message to my child. FORGET THIS ONE"
2,a lesson,"let this be a lesson to all of you dissatisfied customers, as I have been saying in several of my reviews here on amazon : if you pay peanuts for old classic movies...you GET peanuts! ONLY buy from respected big studios or high standard companies that put out well restaured and high quality product..after all THEY have a reputation to hold up! All those small kitchen sink dvd purveyors of old films in the public domain don't care about movies, only a quick buck... and that is what you are giving them!"
1,Flop Flop Flop Flop,This movie has absolutely the worst plot. The not so erotic sex scenes do not help out at all either. Only once do you see the hairs on one of the girls bodies. This movie can definetly be passed and you wil not regret watching it. Get Lolida 2000 instead
3,MIA AND AMBER,I must say that Regina Russell is not one of my favorites although she seems to be popular and appears in many of these soft core erotica films. I always look forward to seeing Mia and Amber Newman though.
1,Interesting.,Interesting if you are alive in 100 AD. No place in modern times. Please buy and distribute to your children if you do not want them to understand science in any way.
1,Unexciting,"My children I love science! We just love to see the amazing small details that God infused into all His glorious creation. However; that said, We really do not like this book. It is disjointed and the experiments have been very poorly explained. The ""funny conversations"" between the caracters in the book have little to add to the fun or knowledge of my kids. Science has gone from something they looked forward to to something tedious!! I am looking for a substitute today. Science is anything but tedious and such an amazing opportunity to magnify God.Very disappointing."
1,Propaganda aimed at those too young to know any better.,"Books like this sicken me. This is indoctrination, aimed at children too young to understand the ways they're being lied to. Indoctrination of children into any religion or belief system that they are too young to understand is an evil act. Teach them real science, give them actual information, not propaganda designed to indoctrinate. Teach them to think critically, and let them judge reality for themselves, when they are able."
4,Genesis for Kids,"I think the complete title of this book sums up the purpose of this book ""...Science Experiments that show God's power in Creation!"" I admit I had difficulty making some of the relationships between the days of the creation and the experiments. But this book is for younger children, not for our children that we are trying to teach the actual principles of science. This book introduces our children to science, the process of doing an experiment and gives you some commentary that isn't evolutionary based. It is fun, not complicated science."
4,Virginia teacher,"The book arrived promptly and was packed and shipped to arrive in good condition. I was surprised that there were markings in the book and some parts had highlighting. I had expected the book to not be as ""Used"" but perhaps I am not familiar with the description terms to understand what to expect."
1,The riddle of ROMAN Cahtolicism,It wasn't the book I was looking for. I read an older book in the early 1960's that was The Riddle of Catholicism. It was full of historical detail. This is very political.
4,Usefulness of Anger Control Workbook,"I am a psychologist with a specialty in anger management. I have used McKay and Rogers' Anger Control Workbook in my groups and individual anger management work (in conjunction with some other material) for over 6 years with hundreds of people. I believe it is the most useful book of its type currently on the market and, in my opinion, can be most useful if combined with psychotherapy."
4,Working Out the Anger,This book is excellent for helping students to control their anger. It offers worksheets they can do at home. It's an easy read and an effective discussion tool for handling anger.
3,Wow,"To The one who gave one star, YOU, and ONLY YOU, are responsible for your actions, and for the path you must follow in order to fix these problems. sitting around waitig for some ""higher power"" is just a means of blaming everything and everyone but your self. There was never any mention of a ""higher power"" anywhere in the description either, so why would you assume that there would be any?"
2,What a waste of time,"Somebody put together a bunch of self-reflective lists and says fill these out and know yourself better and then you will be able to control your anger. What DRIVEL! Science is stated in NUMBERS, opinion is written in WORDS. What a bunch of CLAPTRAP this book is, representing itself as scientific methodology. Piffle."
3,i dont know,i got so angry i threw it away but I heard it was a good book and highly reccomended...lol. i just didn't use it at all...hahahahaha
1,Upset that title is deceiving and does not say it HAS NO REFERENCES TO GOD & HIGHER POWER TO HELP,"Board Certified Diplomate American Board of Psychiatry and Neurology Frank Minirth has the other anger workbook [...] that is much better than this one. At least in that one I get some real help from Higher power while I learn to manage anger. Just think title is deceiving and it should have stated on the front cover in large letters that it omits all important reference to higher power that can help :-). A bit of mocking response to the crazy folks who wrote so many negative reviews on the other book :-). I do think it's good if it helps you some with anger, just wish it provided with much more for constant help like Dr. Minirth book."
2,My cat won't play with it :-(,"The mouse is much cuter in the picture than in reality. I am sure my cat does not care about that one bit, I just expected it to look different. Aside from that, cat is not interested. Oh well."
2,CFA Cat Toy,"I bought a few of these in different colors when we first got our kittens. They are well made and look cool. They acted like they were afraid of them. I thought maybe they just seemed too big for them, so I put them away for awhile. Now that they are 1.5 years old they still show no interest in them at all. What a shame! Atticus does like the Sugar Glider made by the same company. I think it's the fuzzy tail that gets him."
3,Served its purpose,"I did not want to spend the money on the higher priced folding balance beams and thought this would work. My daughter likes it and its not too high. She has a history of ankle sprains and I do't worry about her rolling her ankle and falling. However, the material is very heavy and difficult her her to fold and store. I didn't realize it was that heavy, but it works for the price I wanted to spend."
4,beam,took a while to get in....backordered for the holidays. Came a couple weeks later- so our Elf on the Shelf came back out to warn my two to be good and to listen to mom and dad. My kids like using in- fits in our living room and can fold up to store pretty easy- although we have had it out since we got it.
1,Poor Quality Shredder,"My Ativa DQ80M shredder lasted LESS THAN 9 MONTHS of normal shredding capacity. All I used it for was normal paper and minimal credit card chomping. The teeth on the Ativa are not strong. They got bent and then the paper got jammed not only in the bent teeth, but in the space on either side of the teeth roll. I spent more time prying out the paper as I did shredding. As for the 5 year manufacturer's warranty - I agree with the other Amazon reviewer - why bother unless you want to keep trading it in every year. Guess I can still use the mesh wastebasket... :-("
5,Excellent research!,"Well written book that is bound to open your eyes! Every point that the author makes is backed up with solid facts yet it isn't too technical for the average reader. My only complaint is that I wish the author would have spent more time on providing some suggestions for a solution out of this mess our culture is in. And steps everyone can take to turn things around. But then again he might have saved that for his next book?!Anyway, I highly recommend this book for everyone!"
4,Scary revelations,This is a hard book to read though as with each revelation you will get angrier and angrier at the corporate world. It will scare you into eating more healthy alternative foods.
3,GOOD INFO BUT BORING,CHUCKED FULL OF GOOD INFORMATION BUT........A VERY SLOW READ...MAKES YOU WONDER IF THE AUTHOR DID SOME FACT TWISTING.....PLAN TO READ THIS ONE PAGE AT A TIME OR AS A BOOK YOU CAN PICK UP AND PUT DOWN AGAIN...
5,"another ""inconvenient truth""...","Definitely a modern day must read. Hopefully this book will serve as a wake-up call for some people. It seems like a good idea to think about what we put in our bodies. I found the book very well-researched and realistically poignant at that. I also liked that he not only assesses the grim state of affairs, but he offers a solution as well. The only thing that Mr. Fitzgerald forgets to mention is that a lot of the times toxic substances are also added to the the supplements that he recommends taking (such as Ginko Biloba, etc.) as a part of the manufacturing process."
3,Eye Opener,"This book is such a huge eye opener! My only complaints are that the book didn't dive in deep enough. This book really only scratches the surface because the author doesn't have a background in chemistry or any field relating to the subject of the book. All he is is an investigative reporter and the majority of the book he has to rely on quotes from numerous other books and sources. I enjoyed reading it, however in my eyes it would be more credible if it came from someone with an extensive background in chemistry."
1,Junk science of the worst kind,"Randall Fitzgerald is a senior editor of Phenomena magazine, a publication which deals with extraterrestrial life and the supernatural.While there is much that is important to say about toxins in our environment and food supply, Randall Fitzgerald is certainly not the man to be saying it.This is the worst kind of junk science--the kind that sounds plausible and well-researched (18 pages of sources) but draws unsupported, alarmist conclusions."
2,Not as expected,Ordered for my grandmother and her indoor house dog. In addition to the basket being rather small and looking better in photographs that in real life...my grandmother had a difficult time trying to figure out which things were for the dog and which things were for people. The packaging was not clearly marked. It's a great idea - but it's not a great product.
4,Food and toys for everyone,"There was a number of toys and food for our cats, dog and us humans. Lots of variety, all enjoyed every thing. A little pricey, but lots of enjoyment."
3,Musical Montaging at its best!,"Ok this movie is a 1986 cop action movie starring Stallone but the music makes a pretty good statement. Many key parts of the movie are set to music from this soundtrack. Songs to listen to are ""Feel The Heat"" and ""Angel of the City"" and the title track ""Cobra"" Also ""Voice of America's Sons."" There are no superhits here but solid music for an ok movie."
5,Wow,"While reading A Whistling Woman, I kept wishing that more novelists wrote as well, as wonderfully, as A.S. Byatt. A Whistling Woman is a terrific novel, in my opinion almost as good as her phenomenal Possession. The story of Frederica Potter comes to a close (at least for us readers) at the end of the novel, and what a story it is--not for plotting reasons, but for how it is told. A Whistling Woman is an intelligently written, thoughtful and thought provoking novel of ideas focusing on one woman, Frederica, and a number of others who touch her life. Byatt shifts back and forth between plot lines and characters in a manner similar to Iris Murdoch. Like Murdoch, Byatt draws heavily from philisophical learning. All of the characters are highly intelligent and not afraid to show it. This is a wonderful, wonderful novel--one of the best I have read in quite some time. Enjoy!"
1,Not up to Byatt standards,"I have read the first three novels in the series perhaps five times a piece. I have lived deeply in the lives of the characters. My knowledge of English literature and history has added depth because of those novels.Thus, I must admit to deep disappointment in the Whistling Woman. It seemed Byatt just wanted to end the lives of the characters as quickly as possible. The plot was shaky and not quite believable. For me there was no closure. I hate to admit to identifying so greatly with fictional people, but it seemed Byatt had forgotten the lives she created and was thoughtlessly butchering the intricate world she had built.The final novel does not contain enough social and academic theory to satisfy the thirst Byatt so thoroughly quenches.If you love the series, don't read the final book. Make up your own ending. Trust me, it will be much better than the hack job Byatt has handed us."
4,tight beats,"Kasino has a way of snappin on folks that is different from what I've heard in a long time.... his beats are as raw as they come, if you ain't heard, then scoop it up then. be on the look out for that pistol.... kasino is a must"
5,Beef Base,"This is an excellent tasting beef base This restaurant quality beef base can be used to add flavor to not only soups, but stews, gravy, on any other dish that you can think of that needs a beefy flavor, for a fraction of the price of what's available in the grocery stores."
4,Peter Mayle is as refreshing as ever!,"I don't quite understand why others have given Mayle's most recent book on Provence such a negative rating. I find his prose to be as amusing as ever, and as a francophile myself I enjoyed learning more about my favorite region of France. Mayle always manages to transport the reader with his evocative passages. I particularly liked the chapter where Mayle goes to visit a school of perfumery and instructs the reader on some of the ways of the ancient skill. Even a trip for a corkscrew is a joy for him. I feel transported back to France each time I read his books. Good job!"
3,"Losing steam, but still worth reading","I loved his first book, but this one seems less fresh or maybe it is me, the reader, that brings a less fresh response. Still I found enjoyment in many descriptions of local characters or delightful meals. Other passages dragged a little, dwelling on insider stories that I couldn't always follow."
3,More Provence But Nothing New,"It is inevitable that Peter Mayle's new book Encore Provence will be compared to the first book in the series, A Year In Provence, as the better book. This expresses my feeling. Mr. Mayle is a good writer but he covers subject that were done in earlier books, namely truffles and olive oil. There are character portraits like Marius but not much that I can say held my interest.The chapter dealing with foie gras as a component of French longevity I found trite. I cannot think of foie gras without the inhumane methods that produce it. I was wondering how Mr. Mayle could eat it without thinking of geese having a rod rammed down their throats, sometimes causing damage to their neck and leading to infections.In short, a mixed bag of some of the old humor but also a book that had few new observations."
2,We expected more from Mayle,"""Encore Provence"" is a letdown in the wake of Mayle's first 2 books on Provence. It's little more than a potpourri of events from his previous work. The only thread they have in common is France. A single entertaining episode involves a playboy butcher who went to Provence and seduced local wives. Their irate husbands murdered the meatcutter. And the whole thing went down long before Mayle even went to Provence. Finally, even though Mayle pulled his punches this time (perhaps to atone for past slights), he wrote with two pens. True to form, he was critical of the yokels in Provence. Yet, he managed to play it up as a paradise (especially compared to the USA) from which he'll never want to leave. It all seems as though Mayle wanted simply to crank out another book."
3,New readers will like it!,"The die-hard fans of Peter Mayle know all his books intimately, and so the disappointing thing about ""Encore Provence"" is the extensive repetition from both the previous 'Provence' books as well as some of his fictional work. For new readers of Peter Mayle - I'm sure they'll find this book enjoyable. But for those of us who have read and re-read his work over the last 10 years - please give us some new stories next time. However, I'm still a fan!"
3,An Enjoyable Read,"Mayle's earlier works prompted us to explore the Provence area in 1993 and helped to encourage us to purchase a home there in 1995. His latest endeavor, Encore Provence, will provide the reader with further insights into why this region of the world is so very special to Mr. Mayle and to us."
4,"Mayle is one of my favorites, and this one is a winner!","I have enjoyed all of Peter Mayle's books, and when I got to Provence after an absence of 30 years and after reading Toujours Provence, I truly began to appreciate his ability to communicate the intangible wonders of the region. Encore Provence continues the tradition -- I loved it."
1,very disappointed!,"let me first state that I loved the first two books. However, Encore Provence definitely lacks the warmth and engagement of the first two books. I will not recommend it to anyone.Take the second chapter for example - it is unnecessary and very distracting (I found myself taking a second look at the book cover, half not believing that Peter Mayle wasted an entire chapter talking about the newspaper article.) Several other chapters read more like a poor versions of Lonely Planet or Fodor's guidebook.The French may say, 'Jamais deux san trois', but I say 'Don't waste your time' - it's better to reread the first two books."
1,"First Mayle book I've returned, It was filled with fluff.","Peter Mayle was looking for an easy buck this time out, what a disappointment. Instead of great stories, or a real feel for what he found upon his return to Provence, We got well spaced lists and other fillers. With the new writers coming along to describe with delight their experiences in Europe, Mayle makes a poor showing. My excitement quickly turned to dismay. I have read and enjoyed every book until now. I was annoyed enough to return it. I do not intend to contribute to a sucker play at hardback prices. Watch out fans!"
2,Not Mayle at His Best,"As an avid reader of everything Mr. Mayle's written, the Provence books and novels, I was very disappointed in Encore. There was little depth and warmth to the stories, little of Mr. Mayle's brilliant humor and a general feeling of lack of enthusiasm. The stories are more in the nature of reports than humorous tales. Everyone's entitled to a bad day--I hope Mr. Mayle writes another on par with his earlier Provence works and that he's not running out of steam."
2,Not what you've been waiting for--but if addicted...,"unlike the other reviewer, I'm *not* in Provence, and enjoyed ""A Year in,"" and ""Tourjours,"" tremendously. When I saw this title listed a few months ago, I pre-ordered a copy and when it arrived last week I settled down to pick up where I left off last time. However, this book seems to be written at a distance--actually, I found it hard to really understand just how the Mayles returned (for a visit, to live, what?) I'd describe this book as a cross between the first two and his collection of essays, ""Acquired Tastes."" The chapters don't hang together, his style overrides the content--I don't feel immersed in Provence but instead find his writing and opinions the stronger 'voice.' Perhaps his subject matter didn't connect with me; I'm not sure. I wish I'd waited to read reviewer comments *before* ordering the book."
3,"I Love Peter Mayle, but this was a little thin","I read this on my trip to Provance. I loved his first two books, but this time, I felt as though he was just trying to fill a third book. Still he is a great story telleer and some of them were really great!...I also read while there,and would reccommend, Running in Place: Scenes from the South of France by Nicholas Delbanco."
3,"A modest, fun travel book","Not as good as the first book, ""A Year in Provence."" The charm that covered every page of the original is spread much too thinly in this one. The stories about local people and their unique culture are rare in ""Encore."" Nonetheless, it's a handy and amusing travel guide for someone planning a visit to the region."
2,"Look, this may sound cynical, but...","Hey, here goes Peter Mayle again on a jolly-up through the South of France. On one hand, this little light book is worth 5 stars because it it so damned readable; it's like a warm bath on a winters' night, a Marguarita in a tropical beach bar. It's a nursery story for grown ups. Don't get me wrong - I like it! But the fact is I can't help feeling that Peter Mayle is writing to formula. His previous career was in advertising,so he's VERY well aware of who his target readership is, what they like, where they like to go on holiday - and what kind of life they aspire to. Mr Mayle pushes all those right buttons to draw people in to his fairy-tale, safe and sanitised world. Somehow, I just feel he could have written this anywhere, anytime, anyhow. Come on! If you want this kind of stuff, why not jump on a plane to some sunny haven and write your own book. Encore Provence is light, bright, funny and farcical, but for me just a little too false."
4,"Another fun, vicarious tour",Is one of Peter Mayle's Provence books better than another? Who cares? And who remembers when you're in the middle of any one of them. They're all worth the while if you're looking for a lilting ride through another person's favorite countryside. I'd read another if there were a fourth.
4,Definately worth reading,"As someone moving to Provence in the spring, I have been devouring material on the area to aquaint myself with the customs, festivals and pace of life there. Mayle's books have been enticing journeys there. Encore Provence proved more helpful to me (relative to AYIP) as he actually lists the places to go for Oil, truffles and the like. A very enjoyable read"
3,"Fun, but repetitive of past books","I have been a fan of Peter Mayle's earlier works, particularly the other ""Provence"" books. As with the others, this one was a fun, pleasant read, but I kept having the feeling that, during some portions, it was ""deja vu all over again."" For example, there is an entire section on truffles and truffle hunting, as in at least one of the earlier books. While there are some new vignettes with regard to this special fungus, a lot of it seemed repetitve. I almost felt that I would have gotten the same enjoyment by rereading one of the earlier books.Despite this criticism, there are some new stories, and the book was enjoyable, like its predecessors. I just can't give it a higher rating because of the lack of originality."
1,Peter Mayle isn't funny,"Peter Mayle is a perceptive writer on topics like shopping for handmade shoes, where he can be funny without being mean. His books about Provence are not funny. In both his fiction and his memoirs, he treats the citizens of Provence like quaint natives. It's the very worst of stereotyping. What would the reaction be, do you think, if in this day and age a talented writer described black people as shiftless and lazy, or Jews as money-hungry, or all Poles as dull and dumb? Assuming that this writing were ever published, there would be general outrage. So why does Mayle think it's funny to describe the tradesmen and craftsmen of his village as slothful? The real reason Mayle left Provence was that the locals finally figured out what he was saying about them. They threw him out."
4,Peter Mayle Strikes Again (almost).,"Peter Mayle's new book - Encore Provence, is worse than his brothers (A Year in Provance, Toujores Provenes), but is still one of the best books that I've ever read. You can see in this book that mr. Mayle is already tired from Provence. That's why he left to the States. I even flew to Provence (Because of his books) in July, and even after he told us in the book that it was a ""folly"" to live in the States, I asked about him, and some people told me that he went back to the states... But after all - Peter is Peter, and his stories are full of humor and charm. If you have to buy one book - Do not buy this one. buy ""A year in Provence"". But if you have the all series of Peter's books, Buy it. it's worth the price."
2,the author has burned out on this subject,"It is unfortunate that Peter Mayle's gentle humor did not continue in this book. It sounds as if the Provencal tourist bureau took offense at his satirical comments in previous books, and he felt obliged to write an apologetic rebuttal. I was most disappointed, since I thoroughly enjoyed his first (""A Year in P."") and somewhat less its sequel. But this book could have been much more interesting and enjoyable if he had not reworked his old themes."
1,"A Year in Provence all over again, without the freshness","This book is a perfect example of all that is wrong with the publishing industry. They've now milked three books on Provence from this dry,empty author without said author saying anything different or new. You need only read A Year in Provence to get a sense of the author's recurring themes and subjects; indeed, you need read only one paragraph. Here is is: Provence is quaint. The pace is slow. The focus is on food. The French think they know everything. Weather is a factor. There. I've just saved you time and money. Now can Mr. Mayle please move on to something new? ANd keep it brief?"
2,Just for the money?,"I am a Peter Mayle die-hard. So it should not surprise anyone that I reserved my copy of 'Encore Provence' already half a year ago. But now that I've read it, I'm disappointed. 'Encore Provence' is only a shadow of what 'A Year in Provence' or 'Toujours Provence' brought to the mind. This is no story-full-of-life, it's a collection of short pieces that lack the spirit and emotions of Mayle's former work. It may well be that Peter Mayle's body is back in his old Provence, but the writer left his mind elsewhere. I miss the empathy and the lively descriptions. Reading 'Encore Provence' is like tasting a 'seconde maison' of a fabulous wine-estate: you like the taste, but you know that the original you have tasted before, was so much better. I can't get rid of the feeling that the author wrote 'Encore Provence' because he 'had to deliver'. Still I am impatient to get my hands on his next work of Provencal Fiction."
5,Move over LeAnne Here Comes Lila!!,"Lila Mccann has such talent and abilty she almost tops Shina Twain! Even though they are similar in age Lila McCann is a much better singer than LeAnn Rhimes!! 10 stars for Lila McCan!!! ""With you"", ""Crush"" and ""I wanna fall in love"" are 10 star hits!!!"
5,impressed,I was impressed by the ability of this young woman and the quality of her music at such a young age.
5,One Slip and a Century of Repercussions,"It has taken some 90 years for someone, namely, Professor Wayne Andersen, to reveal that one author after another, including Freud and Meyer Schapiro, failed to read Leonardo's reminisence of the ""vulture"" visitation to his cradle, but depended on a 1900 faulty transscription. And every book and essay devoted to the so-called ""Freudian Slip"" repeated each other's errors. Andersen absolves Freud from the ""error."" He provides an accurate transcription of what Leonardo wrote, and in a detailed and flawless manner unravel's the case for Leonardo's homosexuality. As a bonus, Andersen also unravels Freud's case of the Wolf-Man. It's quite a book. Nothing like it available in the literature."
5,paella lovers...,This is the only book you will need if you want to introduce your family and friends to authentic Spanish cuisine!Enjoy!!!
5,Buying my 4th pair,"These go with you when you walk around a corner.Best sneaker i have worn yet at 54 yrs old. Dont buy cloth if your looking for good support, buy leather."
1,Do Not Buy this Book to Learn to Play Go,Korschelt's book has some interest as an 18th century tract if you are interest in the West's discovery of go from a historical perspective. It is way overdue to go out of print. (hint to publisher). This book is nearly useless if you are looking for a book to learn about the game of go. Look under Janice Kim for her introductory books.

1,Bleah,"I am 'Urgently In Hate' with this single. Billy Crawford has a bad atitude and a hygiene problem (I got that from a photo and interview)and now I found out that she has a hideous voice, tune, and songs."
3,"cardboard spongebob,fell a part",This is not made for kids. Spongebob fell apart and his arms fall off! I'm glueing it together a 3nd time
4,Fun for all,"My little ones are 2,and 3...they love this game when their older siblings 6,7,&8 play with them...it is really fun for them all."
2,Poor Quality,I found this to be a poorly made game especially when it is for use for 3 year olds. I had to send it back.
1,Sent wrong video.,"Per product description, this was the original Spanish movie from 1955 with English subtitles. The product that I received was a dubbed, English only DVD. I had purchased the DVD for my Spanish classes. Unable to use the video and had to return it."
3,Miracle of Marcelino NOT in Spanish,"This was an award winning movie out of Spain and I wanted it in the original Spanish with English subtitles - it came dubbed in english which is not acceptable. I then ordered a VHS version that specifically said ""Spanish"". It was the same dubbed version and I had to pay postage to return it. It was not much but when I make a mistake ... I pay, when someone else makes a mistake ... I Pay ?? Not fair."
4,Wonderful Touching Film.,"This film is so great. It brought my father to tears. The absoulutly only reason I give this four stars and not five it becasue the Englsh subtitles are lacking. The subtitles that are on screen are easy to follow, but there are several parts of the film that could have be translated much better. There is a beautiful song sung that never gets translated. Sadly those not biligual miss out, granted the actions during the song hits to what is being said, but it still would be nice to read it instead of having it translated by friends or relatives."
1,don't know,I ordered the miracle of marcelino on the 12th of January and have not received it as of 3/30/05. I will buy nothing from amazon.com again
3,Charming,"Charming and affecting, 'Miracle of Marcelino' recounts the story of an infant who is left on the steps of a monastery. Not able to find a suitable home, the monks rear the boy with understanding and love. Unable to have a friend to play with when he grows older, the boy resorts to a lot of mischief that doesn't play well with the monks or the townspeople, including an opportunistic mayor who wants custody of the boy. Much of his devilry is fun to watch, though. With a convincing resolution, the boy's problem of loneliness unites the monastery and the town in one leap of faith. (Heartwarming film)"
5,Marcelino is adorable!,I love this movie and think every home should have it...its well done and sends such a positive message. I love watching it!
4,one of the best cristian movies,Its great and it really gets to you.I recommend it to everyone and even though it was in black n white its great.
5,miracle,First saw this on TV in 1963 and was moved by the story of young boy taken in by gruff group of Catholic brothers at a monastery who come across as having the personalities of the 7 Dwarves of Snow White fame. But his faith is greater than all of their's combined. Still moved me when I saw it again 45 years later as a time worn weary adult who has lost the youthful innocence that made the first viewing the more memorable one.
1,dissapointment,This is not the movie as shown on the package....There is no movie of Marcelino Pan y Vino.....Just a communion film
5,External DVD player,Great product. Easy to use. Not much set up. Great if you have a Netbook and need an external DVD player. Haven't tried the writer yet.
2,makes a lot of coasters,i bought this item recently and it makes a lot of coasters. about 2/3 of the time when i burn from an iso and about 1/3 of the time when i'm making a hard drive backup.aside from that it's great.
5,Pioneer External USB 2.0 DVD / CD Writer (DVR-X122S),I have a HP Pavilion a1220n with a HP DVD writer 740b. This particular DVD writer (740b) has been useless since I've purchased this desktop. I read numerous reviews about external DVD/CD writers and decided on the Pioneer DVR-X122S. I installed the Nero software and the Pioneer worked perfect. Excellent purchase and excellent seller. The Pioneer X122S has read every CD I've tried. It has also burned flawlessly as well. This was one of those purchases that turned out to be everything I could have hoped for.
2,Short Lifespan,"This Pioneer product worked fine for the first 6 months of average use, but now only reads/writes CDs. It will no longer recognize DVDs. I am saddened when a product becomes crippled at such a young age."
4,Pioneer External USB 2.0 DVD / CD Writer (DVR-X122S),"Have not ried out the included software, but it has worked as advertised for reading CDs and DVDs."
5,a great sleepytime book,"This is one of those wonderful books that you can read to your child at bedtime when they just want to hear the sound of your voice. there is nothing too exciting going on, you can just have your child close their eyes, you can stroke their hair, and read this sweet story. OR, during the day, you can animate all of the animals' voices and have the child touch the great tactile pages. It is a great book!"
3,old model,"Unfortunately this is the older model of the Mountain Hardwear Exposure parka with ""Conduit"" not with ""DryQ Elite"".Which means you are selling us an outdated old model of this jacket.True, if you read the small print on the specs you can see this, but I guess most people (me among them...) naturally assume they are buying the current model.Its probably worth spending a few more dollars and getting the newer technology with (advertised) much better breathability."
3,"Homesy, folksey charm","A group of oddly disparate friends gathers regularly at the local coffee shop for conversation and what they call the ""Tall Pine Polka"", an expression of goodwill, happiness and general joie de vivre. The group consists of Lee, the owner of the coffee shop who is escaping a abusive husband, Miss Penk and Frau Katt, the towns' only lesbian couple, Pete, the proprietor of a shoe shop who secretly loves Lee, Mary who writes appallingly bad poetry and Fenny Ness, owner of the local hardware store. When a movie company decides to use the town as the setting for a movie and a musician named Big Bill moves into town, Lee and Fenny find themselves at odds for the first time as they both fall for the handsome and personable man, not realising that they both fancy him.It's a pleasant read, full of amusing characters, a book to read when nothing too demanding is needed."
1,Almost a caricature of her earlier writing,"What happened to Landvik's writing? The Tall Pine Polka reads like a caricature of her earlier novels -- also with quirky characters, but who were treated with respect, and whose stories were developed. This novel is shallow, filled with condescendingly clever one-liners, one soap-opera incident after another without much point. I don't know if I would read Landvik again after this."
3,Tall Pine Delight,"This early Landvik has all the earmarks we have come to expect. Quirky, but believeable characters, surprise twists and some real pathos as a community is forged of this diverse group. I'd like to have a summer home in Tall Pine."
1,Stupid,"Don't waste your time with this one! If you like grotesquely contrived ""wacky"" misfits, like the goofy sidekicks from a million bad sitcoms, you will be in your element. I agree, comparing this author to a fine one like Michael Lee West is an insult to Ms. West."
1,A major disappointment from a talented Minnesota writer,"I loved Landvik's previous two books, but have to say I was throughly disappointed with this one. There was not one character that I could cheer for; I wanted to slap Fenny more than once and tell her to get over her self pity. And Bill, what a loser! Compared to Your Oasis on Flame Lake and Patty Jane's House of Curl, this is a dog. Lorna, stick to writing about the Minnesota you know - anywhere SOUTH of Brainard!"
1,I wasted my time on this one.,"The characters were quirky and definately had potential. But the novel read like one great long trail of gossip that I heard but didn't really care about. At mid-point it seemed like it should end and I still had 200 pages to go! It went further downhill from there with some really sappy and/or silly scenes that bordered on being pathetic. It was MUCH longer than it needed to be and I'm surprised that it made by any self-respecting editor. I'm very, very sorry I wasted several hours on this novel when there is much more enjoyable material out there. (Would recommend Plainsong by Kent Haruf as a far superior read. Not much by way of humor but a wonderful and moving story of small town characters.)"
1,Tall Pine Polka plays off key,"Lorna Landvik's latest novel is not in the same league as her first two: Patty Jane's House of Curl and Your Oasis on Flame Lake. Having read and enjoyed both, I could hardly wait for Tall Pine Polka. I was sorely dissappointed. I wish I'd at least borrowed it from the library rather than rushing to buy a new hardcover. I could have returned it early and not been out not a dime.None of the characters are people I would ever care to meet and in fact would even dislike if I ever did. Moreover, these characters are not even close to a realistic portrayal of small town residents in Northern Minnesota or even Minneapolis for that matter. Some of them are far stranger than the Hollywood types that invade the small town as the mainstay of the plot.I would not recommend this piece to a friend and will wait for paperback or a library edition to come out before trying her next novel."
2,Amiable Cluelessness,"This book contains a set of amiably quirky characters from upstate Minnesota and Hollywood. The author's insider knowledge gives the moviemaking scenes (a considerable portion of the book) a degree of verisimilitude.If you by some chance actually like this book then I would recommend a Jon Hassler novel to you in addition. Begin with his ""Staggerford"". It has a similar setting, range of unusual and well-drawn characters, and even shares at least one key plot element. It would be worth your while to determine why his book has an enduring depth that Landvik's clueless novel lacks (and it's not just that as a college English professor, he possesses a sounder grasp of the language)."
2,disappointing and predictable,"I enjoyed reading earlier Landvik books, and felt they were good vacation reads. This one could be too, being a very light read. However, when I finished it I felt like I had wasted my time. All the way through it seemed like I was reading a made-for-tv movie script--everything was trite and predictable. I found myself skipping paragraphs of boring dialogue just to get to the ending (sort of like watching a sitcom--I could tune out parts I wasn't interested in very easily). An okay book if you really don't want to think about anything, but not something that will keep you on the edge of your seat or even laughing all that much."
2,disappointment,"I have loved the characters in her previous books and enjoyed the humor of her stories. Tall Pine Polka just doesnt get there, it was very disappointing. The characters feel contrived and the story is a not very funny caricature of Minnesota. Skip this one and enjoy the others."
1,Not a great story,"I loved the author's previous works but I was greatly disappointed with this one. I could not finish it, it didn't have the mmpf! that her other books had. The characters were interesting but I found the story to be slow."
5,Wonderfully inspring,"The story revolve round a group of lively coffee-lovers in a small town, the Tall Pine. Central to the story is the lovable Fenny Ness and her friend Lee. A summary of the story will not do justice to the book as all the characters in the book, no matter how small their roles were, made the whole book came alive. The story brought in Hollywood, romance and rivalry, and traces of tragedies, but through them all, the characters remained true to themselves and their beliefs. The whole book is so lively, so lovable that I found it hard to put down.Reading the book, I felt as if I know Fenny, Bill, Lee and gang all my life, sharing their laughter and tears. It was as if I am part of Cup O¡Delight. It made me feel inspired and encouraged at the thought that there is some place in the world where faults are accepted, where rules can be broken gracefully and where love conquers all."
1,"Dull, dragging, contrived, YUK!","I loved Patty Janes House of Curl. I expected to read a funny, endearing third novel by Landvik. Disappointment would be a kind way to say how I felt about this book. I slogged through it hoping it would get better. What a mistake, I should have gone with my first impulse and headed straight to the used bookstaore to get rid of it. I'm on my way now."
2,Definately not on par with other Landvik novels,"I wanted to like this book but didn't. I have honestly enjoyed her other novels (Flame Lake, Angry Housewivies, House of Curl, etc..); however, I just could not get into this book"
4,Good until the last drop,This was my first Landvik novel and I thoroughly enjoyed it ... until the end. I thought the ending was bogged down with too many details that were unnecessary. Part of the joy of reading is the mystery that remains when you close the book. But I would recommend this book. It's a fun read.
1,Very Disappointing,"I began reading Landvik's novels last year with ""Oh My Stars"" and found them all the be very good. This one was a huge disappointment The heroine, Fenny, was totally unlikeable, selfish, self-centered, self-serving --- and it was hard to really invest too much in any of the other characters. Back story was needed for several, particularly Slim. One of the few likeable characters was killed half way through the book and I couldn't help wishing it had been Fenny I also thought Frau Katte's accent was stupid and hard to read. Finally, the story line seemed to go nowhere."
2,Just drug on without real suspense,"I really enjoyed ""Oasis on Flame Lake"" and hoped for a similar quality, but found instead a book that should have ended several times after page 250 only to go into one useless post-plot after another. Don't give up on Lorna Landvik as she's a wonderful writer, but bypass a dance with this polka."
1,I tried so hard to like it,"I've enjoyed the author's quirky characters in other books, and expect the unusual character driven book. I dragged through this book, picking it up and down for over 2 months. It was curosity only that got me through the book; I wanted to see what else she might throw at the characters. The events that affected each character's life seemed very contrived and not story driven. Not a recommended read."
3,"Entertaining, but a bit annoying","I very much enjoyed aspects of this book. Unfortunately, I found several of the characters either to be unbelievable or to be too one-dimensional for me to really empathize with them. I think it's a product of the omniscent narrator; we get the perspectives of so many characters that I don't feel like I know or understand many of them on an emotional level--I don't understand what drives them, mostly. I don't agree with some of their reactions, and I think it's because I don't know exactly where they're coming from."
2,Too crazy and predictable,"I was looking for a light and easy read while vacationing and this was a good book for that. I enjoyed the first half and learning about all the characters and their relationships, but then it just got too crazy and predictable. The bad ex-husband comes back for revenge of course and I knew that Lee was pregnant when she took off. The ""pooping"" line was funny the first couple of times, but was pathetic by the 6th or 7th reference. A happily ever after ending was slapped in quite abruptly I thought after so much tragedy that seemed to never end. I also tired of the message: Hollywood bad, small town folks good. I loved Patty Jane's House of Curl, by the way, and look forward to reading her earlier book as well."
1,Where's the fun?????,This book is such a disappointment to me. Here I was ready for some good laughs since her two previous books were so much fun. I read lll pages and was so darned bored. I had one laugh in lll pages. So I checked to see what the other customer reviews were and realized it wasn't just me. Off to the second hand bookstore it goes.
2,a silly light read,"I read this on a plane, which was probably pretty appropriate. The author takes us into well-covered territory: a movie crew invades a small town full of lovable eccentrics. This scenario is handled much better in ""State and Main."" The characters here are almost irritatingly quirky, the plot predictable, the conclusions trite. Still, when you're stuck on a long flight, you could do a lot worse."
4,I want to live there !,I love this book ! I want to live with these people and be a part of their lives. I hated for it to end and want to know more of them! YEA !!!
4,the right approach,"Perhaps lesser known, but Dempsey Wright is a good guitarist who plays very relaxed with a nice sound, perfectly matching Richie Kamuca on tenor. Also featured is Ben Tucker on bass. You can really hear him! There is also the propelling drumwork of Stan Levey and the vibes of Vic Feldman who plays piano as well. When the last case, you wish to hear him a bit louder, but this can be a matter of taste. A fine cd, not only for guitar lovers. This is also music for Kamuca fans, because he is extensively featured."
5,Sprouter Lar,Just what I was looking for. Had one of these years ago and lost it in a move. So easy to make your own sprouts this way. Great to have FRESH sprouts again.
4,Who knew he had id in him?,"Personally, I'm not a huge Oakenfold fan - not so high on his mixing skills or his choice of tracks. That said, this is a really good set. Disc 1 is a nice trip, starting with some mellow D&B grooves (actually remeniscent of K&D's Conversions Set!) in which Omni Trio is a nice touch, moving on through some ambient-inspired moods, finally finishing with some nice groovy trance. Throughout, its an easy listen, and is equally suited for dancing or chilling. Disc 2 for me is a bit of a fall off from the first, though Oakey fans will probably dig it. It's a bit more like his standard fare of happy feeling trance, though this disc does have more imagination than do Tranceport and the like. All in all, this blows away his other releases and, for me, is a really pleasant surprise."
2,overrated,I have tried very hard to appreciate Oakie but I think he just makes it too abrupt and mainstream.The scene has drifted to deeper turf now. His best skills are as a producer and businessman.
4,Great older CD,CD 1 is basically Drum & Bass but it definetly rocks. CD 2 has the picks up on some older trance but it will definetly get you moving. If you want to complete your Oaky this is a must.
3,some good old school stuff,"just so you all know, the first cd is a atmospheric syle drum and bass mix. so if your into that, its all good. the second cd is old 97 trance. its not as good as some of his other selections of songs i heard for mixes, but its still a good cd."
4,"Oaky's great, but this one is showing age","I walked into a record store the other day and they were playing ""live in oslo"" disk 1, I know because I have listened to it so many times. I didn't have a good reaction to it though. It just sounds dated. The drum&bass is good and cool... but still sounds like D&B from a few years ago and the same goes for the trance on the other CD. I have the utmost respect for Oaky, especially with his Tranceport and Resident releases... but this one just hasn't held the test of time well. For people who haven't heard much trance, this is a good CD, and they will enjoy it. Those people will be even happier once the listen to someone like sasha or Oakies newer stuff... For people who are tired of the usual trance anthem, this is a good break. But for people who have been listening to trance for several years, they will recognize exactly how dated this really is."
3,Dickey is getting better,I have honestly never been a big Eric Jerome Dickey fan but this book wasn't too bad. It had a slow start introducing the characters and picking up the plot but it was a good ending. It is worth a read for a different twist to the average my husband cheated story line..........
4,Impressed!!!,"This was my first time ready a EJD book. I was very impressed. This is the book I have read only in 2 1/2 days. He kept me guessing how it was going to end. It didn't end the way I thought, though. I suggest everyone read this for pure entertainment, as well as education!"
5,I can read it everyday,"This is the best book ever written by Mr.Dickey. It starts of confusing, then you get further along and suprises pop up at every corner. Then you see all that was confusing pull together slowly and shockingly. It's a story about a morden couple who start to drift apart. He works days and She, the wife works nights. He cheats and loses her. In what way does he lose her, mentally, physically, emotionally, or maybe all three. He trys to make up for what he has done to his marriage. She trys to forgive but she gets just as cought up as he did. Now you have to figure out who really ruined the marriage."
2,THE OTHER WOMAN,"I like Eric Jerome Dickey books. I thought from the description it sounded really good, so I decided to read it. The storyline was slow & boring. The characters was okay. The story could have had more drama. The ending was shocking & surprising to me. I thought the ending was the best part of the story."
5,Perfect for a trip!,"I bought this audio book for a 10 hour trip and it delivered. It made the trip seem more like 2 hours. It's a bit predictable at times; however, it kept my attention and me wanting more. I actually skipped a bathroom break a couple of times when the book was getting really good. Great read/listen!!!"
4,A good read,good book ! kind of sad. I read the book in one day. I really enjoyed the book but needed better ending
3,Pretty Good,"This is a good book about the complexities of marriages and relationship's, but the ending was predictable. I like Eric Jerome Dickey, and will continue to read his books."
3,good but could've been better,One thing I can say about this book is you will not be able to put it down. I kept reading because I just couldn't wait to find out what happened in the end.Could've been alot shorter if it wasn't filled with so many details.
3,Lesson,This book was good but I have read better i.e. Carl Webber (all of his book)........anyways it gives you a lesson about cheating and other things.........I enjoyed the book it just wasn't a page turner...
3,An OK read,"This book was a short story that was s-t-r-e-t-c-h-e-d into a novel. The plot was not as intense as I thought that it would be. For an Eric Jerome Dickey novel, I was a bit disspointed."
2,too much &#@%&*???,"This was my first EJD novel, and for the most part I found it riveting and realistic, however I also felt it could have been much better for this reader. I was constantly hoping the main character Freckles, would exude more class and dignity so I could cheer for her more. I totally lost what little respect I had for her character towards the end, and that made it a chore for me to finish this novel."
4,Sexy and Suspenseful,This book was well written and the various twist within the storyline resulted in an exciting reading experience. Its definitely is a must read for fans of Eric Jerome Dickey.
5,WON-DER- FUL!!!,This book was absoluetly amazing. I couldn't put it down. EJD nailed this novel to perfection. I had to go out to buy a second copy to keep in my DON'T TOUCH/WON'T LET ANYONE BORROW book case.
5,A PAGE TURNER,I loved this book i read it in the span of a day i jus couldnt put it down. It dealt with so many levels of emotion and infidelity and how one mistake can change everything. The twist and turns within the book blew my mind and the ending was one i would have never expected i will reccomend this book to n e one who will listen and give it the time of day.
4,"It's About Darn Time! Welcome Back, EJD!!","I have to say that I am SO pleased to FINALLY have the old EJD back. I have been so completely disappointed by every book written by EJD since Friends & Lovers. I finally gave up on him... until a friend convinced me to read The Other Woman.This story was excellent. As a Los Angeleno, I always appreciate the realistic portrayals of our cities, freeways, etc.The realism also extends to the raw emotions experienced by each character as the drama unfolds and unfolds and unfolds almost until the very end.The only reason I did not give this book 5 stars is because I thought the ending was excessive and unnecessary. This book could stand alone without the explosive ending (an ending that is all too familiar to anyone who read the equally-excessive ending used in M. Baisden's last offering -- but who's drawing comparisons? At least I didn't trip over typos in this book! *wink*).Overall, excellent job. My favorite author has finally come back to me! *smiles*"
5,One of his best,"First, I have read all of Eric Jerome Dickey's books and this is by far the best. You have a great mixture of emotions going on throughout the entire book from happiness to revenge to tragedy. You will not be able to put this book down from start to finish. Eric out did himself on this one. It is a definite must read."
4,Really makes you wonder if your mate is cheating,"This was altogether a great read, but I think the ending could have been a little bit better. It kind of left me hanging. There needs to be a summary in another one of Dickey's books about what happened after the character went on the road with her horn. Does she every rekindle the relationship with her husband? I mean everything up until that point of the book was intriguing. It definetly has the potential to be a great movie. This was the first book I read by Dickey, but I do plan to read ""Naughty or Nice"". Sound like it will be a great read as well."
5,A MUST Read,"People, People People...This is, if not THE BEST, one of EJD Best Books. His characters are so true. I felt like I had lived thru this with his main character. She is a strong woman who knows what it takes to be a success in the business. She tries to balance all and comes to the realization that her perfect life & marriage is far from it. EJD took me back and made me re-live my past. He speaks the truth. this is no ""fairy tale"", this is real life, how we all have lived, or felt at one time in our lives. I applaud Eric Jerome Dickey for keeping it real!"
5,Intruguing,"A fan of EJD, I was not dissapointed with his latest novel. The story and the chrachters pulled me in and it was har for me to put it down. The story is intense and passionate as are the characters."
5,Excellent 1 Day Read,You can really get lost in the passion of this book. It's a great story from a woman's point of view... a first from EJD. He has proven time and time again that he is at the top of his game. Get it if you are married and get it if you just want to really feel for all the characters as each page of the story unfolds! You will not be disappointed!
3,eric jerome dickey the other woman,"i thought this book was going to be a bad read but i went to the book store and i was told that the book was not doing very well, so i was scared to read it because i thought it was not a good book , and was going to be like the other books i have read by this author but this book was gooooooooood i mean i love this book and i hope the next one is better."
3,It's ok,"I have all of E.J.D's books, and I loved most of them like Milk in My Coffee, and Friends and Lovers. This isn't his best, but I like it."
2,O-kay,"Nice climax. Not a true EJD fan yet, but there was drama and suspense in this book that held my attention. nice read."
5,"Review on ""The Other Woman"" by Eric Jerome Dickey","I read ""The Other Woman"" and I thought it was wonderful and dramatic because even though the book is fiction, it does happen in life today.Not only men do it but women do too. So I felt really connected to the book because a lot of men or women can realte to this book.Sincerely,Valencia Nunley"
4,good read,"this book really surprised me. it starts off a bit too detailed and kinda does that a few times thoughout the book. T.M.I. :) but then the story heats up and it gets good. i anticipated what would happen between the lovers triangle and was so shocked at the ending that i actually cried. i think the female, who by the way is unnamed, should have made a different dicision in the ending and felt it could have ended a little better. but overall a great story."
4,The Darkside of Comuppance . . .,"EJD I have always been a great fan of yours. Your writing is excellent! However, your last book ""The Other Woman"" was good writing but, in my opinion, very dark material. It left me feeling somewhat depressed. I still look forward to your next book and I hope that the story is a little more up beat. I have always credited you for finding humor in the worst situations. Even though couples had done the most unthinkable things to one another, you gave them their comeuppance in creative ways not lingering on the negativity of the relationship but rather capturing human flaws and faults with comedy. That's what I really like about your writing and hope to see again in your future books. Thanks for another good read. Hope to see you again on your next trip to Waldens Virginia Center Commons."
3,not so great,"I have most of the books by EJD and I have to say-this one was the least captivatingConstipated read, predictable ending, very predictable"
4,"Good, but starts slow","This was my first EJD book and it won't be my last. The book started out very slow and I almost didn't continue to read it, but it finally picked up and ended up being a good read. Since I've heard so much about EJD, I'm going to check out more of his books and won't shoot this one down so badly. Overall, it was a good book, the ending was very surprising."
3,Okay Read,I thought the book was slow in the beginning and in the middle. Toward the end it pick up a lot. I skipped a lot of this book and didn't miss a beat. I didn't care for the ending much a little rushed. But all in all it was okay.
3,I was expecting more.,"I was really expecting more from this book. I'm a fan of EJD, but after Thieves Paradise, I was hesitant to buy The Other Woman. The story was okay...it will keep you interested, but this book isn't EJD's best work. If you're looking for a good book from EJD, I suggest Milk In My Coffee, Cheaters, Between Lovers.Others,.. Men Cry In The Dark by Michael Basisden, 4 Guys and Trouble by Marcus Major"
5,Hot Like Fire,"If your looking for a good mix of sex and drama then The Other Women has got what your looking for. I read the book and I have to say it had me crying to the very last tear. Call me emotional, but it was that real. Eric helps you not only to see the characters, but also to feel what their going through each time, drawing you into it little by little. The book takes you on a rollercoaster full of excitement. So don't even think twice, and look no futher... Make this book yours to keep...you won't regret it.**promise** ((BET YOU CAN'T JUST READ ONE PAGE!!))"
4,An Opera Neophyte,"All in all a very good presentation. The Soprano took a little while to warm up, ""Oscar"" was a delight, and Pavarotti was not in his strongest voice but, as I said, a very good presentation. Deutsche Grammaphon seems to excel in these Metropolitan Opera recordings."
5,Awsome Cd!!,"If your a Whitecross fan or you like old school rock, you gotta have this cd this is there best album by far, out of all there albums, Must have!! 5 Stars all the way!!"
5,Hits keep on rollin'.,Abby becomes a suspect in the murder of her law-school nemesis Professor. Will she be able to beat the rap? The usual supporting characters return in this installment of the Flower Shop Mystery series.
3,Well done... if you don't mind occasional crude language.,"Kate Collins is a gifted writer who knows her setting- a flower shop. This was a good read, although I could do without the occasional ""earthy"" language."
2,SOMEWHAT ANNOYING---,Abby was a little too whiny during the first half of this story and it got on my nerves. The second half became more enjoyable.
2,Not so good,"As a physics student, I found that Wangsness gets lost in mathematical formalism and does not seem to present important concepts in a lucid form. There must exist 1000 E&M texts, and I would suggest one of the others (Griffiths, etc.)"
5,"Griffiths this, Griffiths that.","OK, OK... so Griffiths is a very good text. I believe this book is better, having read both. Overall, 'EM Fields' is very well written, providing a strong background in vector calculus to bolster the topics that follow. I agree with the other reviewer who writes that explanations are based on mathematical rather than physical arguments. However, I find this style easier to understand. I do not believe that this formalism detracts from an overall grasp of the material, provided that physical intuition is used as well."
4,"The all around best junior-senior level physics book, period","Wangsness can seem daunting at first glance, however after using this book as a text for my first formal E&M class, it is my opinion that the mathematical rigor presented was perfectely matched with the logical development of electromagnetism. So many physics/math books are either falling off a log easy or too ridiculously abstract as to be used for any practical learning. I found the text by Wangsness to be exceptionally well developed, offering just the right blend of rigor and application. Accordingly, the problems at the end of each chapter reflect this development. Most other books I have seen on the subject offer very few workable problems and even fewer answers. This book is loaded with exercises at the end of each chapter that range from simply tedious to very difficult, which again, exemplifies the author's ability to fully develop a real understanding of E&M."
3,Respectable E&M book,"This text has its good points: Its calculations are all done in careful, explicit detail, and it contains a lot of physics which you won't find elsewhere. (In particular, its discussion of wave propagation in media is quite good.) However, the book has a few problems: Its discussion of radiation is rather weak (compared with Griffiths, for instance). And it is not very well written: Wangsness' derivations tend to rely more upon mathematical manipulations than physical principles. Readers who would prefer a solid discussion of the _physics_ of electromagnetic fields should (depending on their math backgrounds) consult either Jackson or Griffiths."
2,Product did not work for me.,My neighbor told me that we have a really bad flea problem and she has not had any luck with any of the flea products out there. Thought I would try Frontline and see but it did not work.
4,Great Product,"I have been purchasing this product for years. I finally got tired of paying so much so I bought a cheaper off brand, and chunks of our cats' fur fell out where we applied the off brand product, so we quickly returned to Frontline. Four stars because it works like a charm, I just think it's a little spendy."
3,Can't Tell,"We've always used Advantage. This is the first time we tried this brand. Not finding that it works any better, but it's cheaper."
3,not as strong,Do not seem to work as well as in past uses. We did not get they same positive results we usually get.
5,works awesome on mostly outdoor cat,This product works really well. Our cat spends a lot of time outdoors and used to get fleas regularly even with flea collars. This stuff is easy to apply and works. We haven't had fleas again in 8 months.
5,effective,"I've had at least one, and usually more, indoor/outdoor cats in my life for over 30 years. I started using Frontline TopSpot when it first came out, and it is the only flea remedy that has ever worked to completely eliminate the little buggers. Usually, I need to apply it only once per season. Previously, I had tried various powders and dips, and none of those methods worked. Once, I tried a cheaper TopSpot-like product, and it didn't work either. Frontline TopSpot is the one the vets recommend, and it's the one I've had the best results with."
1,Real Frontline?,"I used this product correctly on my indoor cat who has never had a problem with fleas. While it may have looked like this product initially worked a little they were back after 2 weeks and I do not have fleas in my place anywhere. I have to wonder if what was shipped is really the true Frontline product? I have used other brands on her and they did the job fast and properly, after reapplying a 2nd time, they have returned. All I can say is buyer beware!"
1,Worst Flea Treatment I've Ever Used,"I ordered this product for my cat, as a change from Advantage II, because of the less expensive price. I applied it as directed to my cat who was, until this time, completely flea free (thanks, I'm assuming, to Advantage). Three days after applying Frontline Top Spot, my cat was INFESTED with fleas. His neck, head, and underarms were covered, and every time his scratched, flea eggs rained onto the table. The ONLY change in my cat's life was the brand of flea treatment we used. I am pursuing a refund and will NEVER but Frontline again."
1,A waste of my money.,"I normally buy Advantage, and decided to try this product since it was cheaper. Never again. I wasted my money, so I didn't save a penny. I will now have to buy Advantage, since this product did not work. My cats are blonde and orange, so it is very easy to see the fleas on them. And this product, after 3 weeks, did not help at all.It is worth it to pay more money for a product that works, instead of being ripped off. Little wonder my Vet doesn't sell this."
1,Not going to buy again,"I am not going to buy pet meds online anymore. My mothers cats got poisoned from this stuff, and I've never had any problems from buying from a pet store. Very sad!"
1,3 Indoor Cats with Fleas-not very useful,"This particular product didn't do anything for my 3 indoor cats who sporadically got fleas. The fleas loved my kitten and he was covered. We washed them and applied the product and the fleas were back on the next day. The next time around I bought Frontline Plus from Amazon and that worked right away. I don't know if this was an old batch or maybe the Plus made a difference (although I thought it just protected against ticks as well) but either way I wouldn't buy this one again. I only spent a few more dollars for the ""plus"" version and it was worth EVERY penny."
1,Warning! Does Not Address the Problem.,"This flea medicine was effective and safe in the past. We used it. But it does not work now. We purchased from various sources: here on Amazon, from the vet among them. But it no longer works. Very disappointed and frustrated. We have multiple INDOOR cats who never go outside. Beware to others. Find another brand and save yourself alot of grief."
2,The fleas are still here!,"I tried this product on my cat who is an indoor/outdoor cat and even after the second application she still had fleas. The more I read about it, the more I realized that this produuct works better to prevent fleas but mainly ticks and does not get rid of fleas well once the cat is infested. I bought Advantage and it worked way better."
5,"An adventurous, captivating yet beautiful story","The story takes place in a mythical land at the dawning of Christian times, and a barbaric tribe is threatening an invasion on Torra Alta, a barony in the northern mountains. The heir to the barony, Caspar, goes on a search for a pagan moonstone, aided by his uncle and a beautiful young pagan priestess. Once you have started reading the book, you won't want to put it down! It deals with prejudice against religion, love between a family and is jammed packed with magick, myth and action."
5,Better than Jordan.,"Put it down? Not a chance! This was a book that literally kept me up all night. Epic fantasy to rival the leaders of the genre. Great plot, imagery and writing pull you through the page into the land of Spar and co, where you're trapped until the final page releases you to wait in eager anticipation for the next book."
1,What a turkey!,"Not even Dustin Hoffman's presence can save this movie. It is simply awful. A joint American-Italian effort (though 'effort' may be misleading), Madigan's Millions is utterly inane and devoid of entertainment. Hoffman looks ill at ease, and fails to convince the audience that he enjoyed making the movie. The poor chap was simply embarrassed, no doubt, at being implicated in such an abysmal attempt at film-making. Dire."
3,Not his best,"While this CD is good, it does not even come close to Christopher Lawrence's others. If you haven't already, try Temptation and Trilogy Part One. You can't ask more from either of those trance CDs. These are fast, acidy, trippy, *slightly* edgy mixes. Christopher Lawrence is playing, in my opinion, a unique combination of trance records that define what trance is all about. His Hook Recordings CD, though, is a bit of a miss."
3,Difficult for little kids,"The quality of the watch is okay. It's sturdy enough for an elementary boy. However, my son just began to tell time and it's not the easiest dial face for a beginner. It has those green snot-like stripes on the face to confuse things and I agree with another reviewer that the face is too small. It's too busy. My son got this for Christmas and he hasn't worn it very much. For beginners I like the Disney ""time teacher"" watches which label the minute and hour hand and include minutes on the face."
1,PRETTY F****D UP,"THIS ALBUM IS ONE OF THE WORST ALBUMS EVER PRODUCED. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY BUYING THIS PIECE OF S***, THANKS."
4,LOVE IT!,"I love this oil! It is for the money, hands down the best. It feels good when I get some of it on my legs on a hot summer day. Some people shy away from such a controversial product but I would have no other oil on my hands and feet. Give it a try!"
5,Great Value,"Works great. Great value for the price. Shipped fast. This comes in very handy when using multiple microphones, whether just talking or singing."
2,Nice to see the gang back together but result is disappointing,"Like most Red Dwarf fans, I was happy to see something new produced after a roughly 10 year hiatus. I did not expect the comic timing of the cast to be perfect after such a long layoff but the script was so weak it would have taken some colossal acting efforts to save it. There were some occasional good moments but they were few and far between. Personally, I believe that most Red Dwarf fans could have come up with a better script. ** Spoiler Alert ** Just off of the top of my head, when the crew is in the ""real"" world seeking out the actors who portray them, I would have like to have seen them meet (for example) Chris Barrie portraying himself as the ""Ace - Smoke me a kipper"" Rimmer persona and Danny John-Jules as Duane Dibbley. All in all, a most disappointing effort."
1,Speechless...,"I think the writing was on the wall when Grant left, as RD after that showed signs of tiredness and lack of originality. I only watched the first episode of 'Back to Earth'; but that was enough. They may as well have put brand new actors in the roles, as at least they may have injected some new life into this travesty. When will comedy writers learn that VERY few shows have a shelf-life beyond about a dozen episodes (even the great Cleese realised that Fawlty Towers couldn't ride on the crest of a wave forever). I LOVE Red Dwarf, but honestly, after Rimmer left, the crucial momentum had been lost (much as I enjoyed Chloe Annett as eye-candy). Don't bother with 'Back to Earth' - it's really poor!"
5,"Great show, no problems for me","I am one of the lucky ones receiving a perfect set. This is great British comedy. Intelligent comedy, not bathroom humor. Highly recommended for people with smart sense of humor."
5,Entertaining DVD,"This movie is great. If you like Red Dwarf or like goofy British science fiction, you will probably like it."
3,Something missing,"It was good to see it back, but it was dissapointing, The banter between them was a bit slow and something was missing. But as my rating shows it was ok, but I would re-watch most of the older episodes 1st."
2,So Sad....to wait so long for this and be SO disappointed!!,"We waited SO long, just like everyone else who loved RED DWARF for them to FINALLY make either the movie or more episodes. However considering how long they had to work on this story you think it would (and SHOULD) have been better. Only very few funny parts, a lot of confusing things-we have all the episodes on dvd and have watched them many times, but I still felt as if I missed a big part or a critical episode. Maybe something was aired on the BBC in the UK that we didn't get here???But as good as it was to see the guys, it was VERY disappointing.If you still want to check it out, see if you can rent it somewhere. I don't recommend purchasing it."
2,I waited for this?!,"Don't bother with this, stick with the original series. This was a letdown to put it mildly! Only redeeming grace was seeing the characters again but the plot? was awful. I'm sorry I watched it & will have to view some of the old series to help erase the memory of this travesty. I feel like a goit for even watching!"
2,Red Dwarf: Back to Earth,"I would have to agree with the other (3) 2 star reviews here. We love Red Dwarf, but this was just not much fun to watch. Too bad."
2,Red Dwarf Final Season?,"probably...if this is as good as it's ever gonna be from here on out! I found it a rather depressing chapter in the character's existances-totally unfunny for the most part and admittedly a bit of a let-down. I'm sorry folks, but I can't be too positive about this one. The other seasons were much better!"
3,"It gets better, really!","Great to see the old gang back. If this were an American show it would ave been ""re-imagined"" wit younger, prettier actors. Unfortunately after such a long absence the story itself left much to be desired but returned to form quite well with Series X. Here's hoping for many more years of adventures with the ""Boys from the Dwarf!"""
4,Entertaining and Fun,"I'll admit to being slightly disappointed after a first viewing. It seemed to borrow too much from the classic series and from Blade Runner. But on subsequent viewings, I really liked this return to the Red Dwarf universe. It holds together nicely as a story and, if seen more as an homage to Blade Runner and the Red Dwarf series, it's actually tightly written and fun with many references to enjoy. There are some great gags and quite touching moments, as well as the more traditional sci-fi themed zaniness. If you're a fan, this is definitely worth picking up."
4,Back to Earth,"You will NOT regret getting the bitter-sweet movie-like conclusion to this British TV show. In fact, you just me be a bit surprised at how it plays out. Plus, the bonus material is nice!"
2,Disappointing and Inconsistent with the TV Shows,"I am a huge fan of the series. Comedy science fiction must be a difficult thing to write well because you rarely see it done and even more rarely find it written well but the television series was a hit on both accounts. The Back to Earth movie, however, was at best a lazy attempt at reproducing the magic that was Red Dwarf and at worst a malicious stab at the heart of everything that made people love the show. So many things I liked about the series are corrupted. Its other-worldliness is gone by having it on Earth; the relationship with Kochanski is over; the postulation about the future where Lister and the cat are all that is left and which is surprisingly hopeful, suddenly becomes farce when the Red Dwarf characters find the reason for their existence. Where is the laugh track? Where is the music?If you are a fan, get this because you will want everything Red Dwarf but do not expect much."
3,Red Dwarf: Back to Earth,"This was not worth the wait. I can't believe that the cast signed on for this inferior script. The earlier episodes did much more with what I can only imagine was a lower budget. The actors did a fine job. However, there's only so much one can do with such a weak plot."
1,Not worth the effort,"I am sorry to say this was a very large disappointment. I had high hopes for it and the boring mess it turned out to be was terrible. It had nothing to do with the last episode of the series and nothing to do with the episode when Lister made it to Earth and ran into his future self, which is what I was expecting. The story was terrible, the end helped make it a little better, but we still had to sit through it. I really would have rather had no show rather than this one."
1,Awful,"Don't waste your money, this is almost unwatchable. I really can't find anything redeeming in it at all. It's got one of the worst scripts ever. It's almost as bad as the American pilot."
3,Is it missing something?,The DVD was OK. It just seemed short and the story line needed more work.I am a big fan of the show. I have seen the whole series on PBS many times. I was excited by a new season.It didn't have the magic of the old show. I think it has been to long to bring it back.
3,A weak entry with problems...,"I picked this up because I've been a Dwarf fan since they first hit the US.And I figured I'd spring for the BluRay edition. Problem is the BBC Video DRM will cause problems on PC based players.I finally got it to play after buying and installing an upgraded software package, but I have to say it really wasn't worth the effort.The first thing that came to mind watching this is that this film was so bland that it could really use a laugh track, because the jokes were so subtle as to be non-existent.The story is OK in concept, but it seems to be a bit of an eff you to fans in part. Nothing over the top, more on par with Shatners ""Get a Life"" speech.So to sum up, it was inoffensive and weak. You can live without it. And avoid the BluRay version unless you enjoy DRM issues."
3,reddwarf9,"the new red dwarf is good,but the supplier sent me the european version,&my computer says it can only be played on my equipment a few times"
2,They should never have made this one.,"I loved Red Dwarf as a series. I thought it was funnier than heck. So as many other fans, I was excited when this came out, but disappointed when I seen it. There isn't a lot of comedy in this one. It seems the writers want to do drama now instead of comedy, but still want to do Red Dwarf. Result: you get a stupid Red Dwarf. Instead of continuing on from where the series left off, it jumps nine years latter with no explaination of how our charaters got out of the mess they were in when we last seen them. And the special effects were crap too. But it wasn't all bad. The actors are as good as ever, and there are some good and funny moments in it, but just not enough. In all, I would not spend my money on this one if I were you."
2,Shedding tears,"I love Red Dwarf, and I think that it's one of the best comedy shows around. I was so excited to see the release of this DVD. Unfortunately, the show was just awful. It could have and should have been so much funnier. The writers did a huge disservice to the characters and to the show, and as a consequence, to the viewers. I thought that Robert Llewellyn, Chris Barrie and Danny John-Jules were great in their respective roles, but Craig Charles' Lister of today just did not strike me as the Lister of yesterday. He wasn't bad, he just wasn't Lister-y enough for me! Maybe as Lister would be if too mellowed by age?I thought the laughs were few and far between, and again, the story itself was just miserable. The main good thing that came out of it is it got me to pull out season one again, and that reminded me why I love Red Dwarf."
3,It's okay,"I must not have read the product description carefully enough. I thought it was a whole season, but it's not. This is just one long episode of the gang back together again for one final laugh. Although I didn't laugh as much as expected. The acting is a little flat, or as if they were trying too hard to get into the old characters again. If you're a die-hard RD fan, you'll probably enjoy it, but don't get you're expectations too high."
3,"I expected better, but it`s worth watching","This was a bit of a let down. The old Red Dwarf series was an excellent comedy. This one isn`t bad, but it just doesn`t live up to paststandards.The special effects are better than the original, but this was not a show that ever depended on, nor needed flashy special effects.If they ever decide to do another, and I`d like to see them continue, I hope they can do a bit better."
5,Ouch!,This is only serious fencer charger! If you never gotten zapped by this baby then your missing out! I took a direct hit to the pinky finger and it numbed my finger and part of my hand I know for a good 7 minutes! We have a digital fencer testing and the baby puts out over 10K volts on our high tensile fence. The Storm Guard is a nice feature which helps protect the unit from lightning. You should still have lightning arrestors on the fence to help prevent it from running back into the charger. The Zareba A100LI is a better buy but it you need lots of power on your fence this unit will deliver to goods! I also might add that an Electric Fence Hawk is and awesome monitor unit to pair this charger with. It will let you know if you have a low voltage situation or no voltage caused by a broken wire! Just something to ponder when your buying a fence charger.
3,Nice,Nice set. Unfortunately this was bought as a gift and the clamps are not big enough for my dad's old thick 1950's table. He said he would get out his tools and shave the table down. He's crazy...
5,Presents another delightful sibling encounter,Max's room is a mess and Ruby wants to clean it; but Max has special ideas about his room - can he preserve his beloved but funky treasures? This presents another delightful sibling encounter.
1,Aweful story,Actually will not be reading this to my toddler. I was hoping for a book that taught how to be helpful and clean up...this one just teaches how to be sneaky and make a mess.
3,"Not the Best, But Necessary","This book comes under the heading of ""necessary reading"" for anyone seriously interested in the war against Japan in general, or in intelligence during that war. The general reader will find the going rather tough as the writing is not carried out in the classic story telling line. But the information content is good and, since there are precious few books on this subject available, it will have to do. Also, it is written mainly from the point of view of British Intelligence in the East and therefore offers some interesting takes on US Intelligence activity and the sometime stormy relationship that existed, not only between US and British intelligence interests, but also between the various British intelligence organizations, themselves. Revealing information, if not gripping reading."
4,Can't go wrong with Marty! (but points off for the packaging),"This is real classy stuff,Marty Paich is one the unsung heroes of jazz. And the cover is a cheescake classic, which doesn't hurt eighter.The lack of a 5th star is for the skimpy, lousy, CHEAP bare bones packaging and liners."
3,"and a rather ignorant reader in Berkeley, at that","I can't judge this book, since I haven't read it. I do know, however, that Werkmeister, whatever one thinks of his politics or his scholarship, is hardly a ""typical bourgeois academic."" a life that early on encountered first-hand both Nazism and communism guaranteed that. in any event, self-styled anti-intellectuals are among the few things even more tiresome than blinkered academics."
4,Wanting more...,"I just want Piers Anthony to keep writing more on the series. This Adept series is not the first one of his I have read, but it is as good as the Incarnations series. It even seems like the writing gets special at the climaxes of these novels, like the author goes into a prose mode, or something like that. He has a special gift for picking the right words to describe scenes of awesome power and unparalleled beauty! I shall read the next book now, and I already think I want to read more than that in this series!"
1,There's no point to Unicorn Point,A good series of books hits rock bottom with this book. The narrator changes in each chapter and this destroys what little chance the story had of being any good. This should be avoided by all fans of the Adepts series.
2,A difficult read from knowledgable authors.,"A difficult read. Decipher this, for example: ""To transition to well-defined development practices, an organization needs to institutionalize a documented process that can be prescriptively applied to individual software systems development projects."" This quote was taken from the first two pages of Chapter 1, ""Motivation"". When you have to read a sentence five times to understand it, it isn't very motivating. It doesn't get better. The figures appear to have been taken directly from a PowerPoint presentation, and do little to clarify the concepts. This could be a good book, as it appears to contain much useful information. It could use a thorough going-over by a technical writer and an illustrator, however."
3,Good solution but no for me.,I bought this solution and than found out that I needed a different type of solution that would be suit my contacts.
1,Doesn't clean my lenses,"I bought this stuff because it was on clearance, and now I know why. I thought I was having terrible allergies with my eyes itchy and contacts cloudy and dry, which has never been a problem for me before. I tried changing contact lens brands, and when that didn't do it, my eye doctor suggested it could be the solution. Turns out it was! The Re-Nu Sensitive does such a lousy job of cleaning them that all kinds of debris are left, plus the solution itself stings and dries my eyes when I put the lenses in. Stay away from this stuff! The only ""sensitive"" thing about it is that it goes easy on dirt and lets it stay on your lenses!"
2,"I didn't really ""get"" this book.",Hmmmm....I didn't really get this book. As a matter of fact I have it on sale on Amazon for really cheap & fast shipping! Take a look!
5,Refreshing and Easy to Read,"A great little book! Can be read in a sitting, or better yet a chapter a day. A wonderful gift, to others or to yourself. Not only shares new ideas for perking up the romance in your life, but also reminds you of those not used recently with one's spouse. This book creatively weaves snipets of self reflection with how to have fun maintaining the most important relationships in our lives! Needed on everyone's coffee table..."
5,Romance and humor,"This book is a great collection of ideas on how to get romance back in your life. I loved the specific suggestions on how I could connect with my mate. I literally laughed out loud - look for the story about the ""Golden Turkey"". I had to stop and read this to my husband. I too, suggest specific places for my him to shop. This would make a great gift especially for yourself."
3,"Great for ""Sex in the City"" girls","Okay so I am more of a free-spirit, feminist, free thinker, boho chic type. I couldn't stand this book. It was given to me by my roommates girlfriend because she felt like she had to give me something, and she knew I probably wouldn't like it. It does have some advice that is sound and I would recommend it to women that are a little bit more ""Carrie Bradshaw""-ish."
3,"Remember, folks, this is a RECIPE book!","As with all Coriolis Black Series books, this one is both great and miserable in that it is a recipe book. Great little examples, nice explanations on how to approach specific VB problems, but once you master the topic, it gets stale fast. Obviously, that makes this book a great reference, for those times when you haven't followed a particular recipe for a while."
2,Poor organization,"Well, the books has got a bunch of information... it may get more info than other books and cover things such as serial port communications which you may not find in some books. But the material is so poorly organize and poorly presented. Worst of all, it's not complete in areas that it covers. For example, you can't really write a program that reads and writes to the serial port continuously by reading this only this book. It can't even tell you different ways to declare an array in one page. It goes all over the places. The example source code never have comments next to them....so you may not even know how comments are writeen in VB...I mean not that it's difficult to find this out, but this is how poorly the book is written. You probably can find a much better book. I don't know much about books on VB, but know books on C and C++ where authors do a much better job in explaining and orginizing materials. Look for a different book."
2,Below Average,This book is VERY high level. It gives very few examples. I am a beginner-intermediate and learn well out of a good reference book. I don't consider this a good reference book even as a beginner. I purchased this because I thought the C++ Black Book was very good. This book does rate with the C++ Black Book.
