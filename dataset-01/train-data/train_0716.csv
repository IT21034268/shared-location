4,A classic in the post-apocalypse genre,"""Out of the Deeps"" by John Wyndham (pseud. for John Beynon Harris) is more than a rattling good yarn. Like all his best works (""Day of the Triffids,"" ""The Chrysalids,"" ""The Midwich Cuckoos""), it posits an intelligent species with needs and aims unimaginably different from our own. The species mounts an attack, and the heroes and heroines somehow survive it, fight back, and win. (In ""Chrysalids,"" the good guys are members of the new species.) If, like me, you're a feminist, try not to be put off by Wyndham's unblushing belief that women are their biology. His innovative thinking and anti-war beliefs, along with his impressive scorn of social institutions, are too good to miss, and he tells a compelling story."
4,An early alien invasion thriller similar to H.G. Wells.,"Before ""Independence Day"" and even ""War of the Worlds"" (film version), there was John Wyndham's book, ""Out of the Deeps"". The title refers to invaders who come from the sea, relentlessly attacking coastal areas, then spreading death and destruction to inland areas across the globe. Humanity's nemesis is intractable, and the course of the invasion chillingly described, in the style of the best H.G. Wells or H.P. Lovecraft work. The method of the invasion is unique, to my knowledge, and the scale immense. If you might enjoy the heart-pounding realism of humanity facing an implacable foe, I heartily recommend this book."
2,out of the deeps,This book was very old. This pages were brittle and yellowed aroung the edges. Several of the pages fell out as I was reading.
2,HUGE FAN -- MORE HUGELY DISAPPOINTED,"This CD is all remakes, mostly more (overly) produced. If you want the better, less overdubbed claptrap songs, get SUBSTANCE. That's what I just did. I am Waaaaay disappointed. I've been a fan since the 80's (I had the original SUBSTANCE in cassette form. Actually, I still do, but I wanted to get the CD). Just very, very unhappy with my purchase. Thankfully, I didn't pay too much for it. If anyone knows which CD had the song, ""KRAFTY"" (I adored that video), please let me know. Happy New-Ordering, folks!"
4,Great release for the completists!,"Just having the original 7-inch release of Ceremony is worth the price! This was recorded before Gillian Gilbert joined the band. As for the rest, especially if you wanted the Run2 single edit or the original 7-inch of Temptation...this is where to look."
5,GOOD CHOICE,"im happy that i got it, really good work, i didnt know they have so many good songs i only knew 2 or 3."
3,Good Music Lousy Mastering Job,"I have mixed feelings on this album. The music itself is great but the quality of the mastering job is borderline criminal. Some ham fisted engineer went hog wild on the compression and loudness on every song. FFT analysis shows a dynamic range of only 5db with signs of clipping everywhere within the spectrum as seen within Audacity. One question...WHY???This album is, by far, the worst sounding album in my collection. Based on what I saw within Audacity it became very clear that this album needs to be re-released and remastered in a downloadable 24bit format to give the dynamic nature of the songs room to fully develop before being clipped off by the limits of a 16/44.1 Redbook CD format. Either that, or give the master tapes to a more qualified mastering engineer who knows how to take advantage of the bandwidth limitations of the Redbook CD format. Its obvious whom ever did this album was either drunk or just plain clueless.What a shame!"
3,Pretty decent,"Interesting collection here. Includes some very familiar songs; Billy Don't Be A Hero, House of the Rising Sun, Baby Now That I've Found You, Love Grows, In The Summertime, etc. and many which I was not familiar with. There are a number of songs which serve as alternate takes on classics too; you hear the song and remember it differently, because another artist had a more popular version. Some of my favorites on this comp include songs that I was not familiar with (or vaguely remember); Son of my Father, Legend of Xanadu, Making your Mind Up, Standing in the Road, and Chirpy Chirpy Cheep Cheep. You also get great songs like Yellow River, My Baby Loves Lovin, Early in the Morning, the fun Gimme Dat Ding, and I'm Telling you Now."
2,Good,"I'd give it 5 stars but it cost too much and the leather should be thikcer for the price.! It should be thicker for the amount of $$ it cost. You have to keep in mind these days that this item can be easily stolen if you don't have an alarm or other devices to stop thieves. Bottom lIne is you want to keep yours $1000 Winch Covered and protected as much as possible.Update!It's still in the original package after 2 weeks. I bought a Noah car cover. I suppose in the Spring when I take my Jeep out and about, I'll put it on my Warner Winch."
5,"Love, love, LOVE it!","It's not my favorite of the scents but the products are identical in quality- my skin is silky soft and I smell delightful. I live in Alaska which is REALLY dry, especially in the winter; this product is a great addition to my evening bath. Husband has also started using it for the same purpose."
3,Eh....,"It was alright. It made the water green, so that's weird... And it made my legs itchy (probably from shaving before using this. It was okay, though. NOT A BUBBLE BATH!"
3,"OK, but not what I expected","I did a search for bath oil beads and this product (along with other scents) came up. I was thinking about the beads that contain oil but this is like a granular powder, or ground bath salts, not the bath oil beads I was looking for. The scent is very, very strong and overpowering so if you have any tendency toward allergies, I would avoid it. It did give a slightly oily feel to the water, so I will give it credit for that. However, I do not think it should be called ""beads"" because that is not traditionally what bath beads meant at one time. I would not order this again as this is not what I wanted."
4,Keep winter dryness away with Vaseline Bath Beads,Vaseline Intensive Care Moisturizing Bath Beads are great at helping to keep your skin from drying out in winter. Plus it makes your bath water feel like silk.
1,These are not beads! It is powder,"I was worried that this was the case when I purchased them. I was looking for the little marble-sized balls of oil, these are not them. Not worth paying the shipping to return. It would be nice if the description of the product had been more helpful!"
1,not what i thought it would be,"you know, i live alone and i enjoy a hot extended bath with the bubbles and all that jazz, and this just did not do anything for me, and i'm not saying i should have better understood the product, but i found what i wanted in shop rite, for example, and normally i would go all draconian on me to first finish up all this stuff, but i got no pushback from my conscious when i chose this new product and decided i didn't even want to mix them. there is nothing objective about this. i'm not saying it's a terrible product. i'm just saying it didn't give me any joy."
5,"Good Price, Smells Great!","My sister and mom used these all the time a long ways back..I bought them each one box of this for Christmas...Both were very happy to get this...I bought some more for my wife.. She is in love with the product. Itsmells pretty good and makes her skin feel even softer than normal.If baths didn't cost so much, I would even bathe in this just to softenmy dry skin.. I do really love the scent. Try some of the other scentsif you are like my wife and just have to take a bath everyday. =)"
5,Perfect,"This razor is perefect, because it shaves well and is good for sensitive skin since it can be used with shaving lotions.Even if you run out of the lotion packets that go in the razor, you can still use other lotions as you would with a manual razor.Since it is wet/dry you can save time by shaving in the shower too. I have tried several razors and this one is the best for sensitive skin, I shave my head with it too and it hardly even irritates my skin then either. Of course, your skin may be different than mine. I bought one four years ago and it still works fine, so the quality is certainly solid.I can't say how it compares to other models however. I can't imagine anything that could be much better."
2,Ripped my neck up.,I find it interesting that all the reviews up to this point say how this razor is good for sensitive skin. This razor ripped up my neck and throat every time I used it. I don't consider myself to have sensitive skin so this was a suprise to me. In my life I've used every kind of blade and electric razor out there and I've never had this problem. The instructions say to use the razor for 30 days so your skin can get used to it. I used this razor for six months with no improvement. I finally threw it in the garbage out of frustration. I gave it two stars because on my face it worked ok (not great) and I did like to be able to use it in the shower. My next electric will be a Braun.
4,Great series.,This is a great series with a strong female lead character. It also has enough quirky characters to please any picky reader.
5,Amazing!!!,"Amazing vocals, seems to prove that although is a metal group the singer actually can sing. And of what range!!!Love every single song."
4,Best Epica album released,"This is the best album Epica has put out yet. The songwriting is really good, Simone is improving a lot, the drummer who recorded the album is awesome (glad to hear he just joined the band as a fulltime member)!! If you're in this style of music, you should get this album."
4,"One Step Forward, One Step Back","Here's my scorecard for Epica:The Phantom Agony - Brilliant music, bad growlingConsign to Oblivion - Very good music, very little growlingDivine Conspiricy - Brilliant music, bad growlingI'm honestly not sure which formula I like better. The brilliant music is hard to pass up, but if they could just keep it and lose the growling I'd be in heaven."
5,Fantastic!,"From the moment I heard the first track to the title track at the end it was nothing short of perfection! Simone Simons has an exquisite voice and the choir throughout is a great touch. The orchestration of the album is fantastic! It gets you pumped right away and keeps you pumped to the end. Tracks like ""Menace of Vanity"", ""The Obsessive Devotion"", and ""Sancta Terra"", a song with a great opening, are exciting tracks mixed with some slower songs such as, ""Chasing the Dragon"", which is slow but also picks up pace because it is such a long song, and ""Safeguard to Paradise"", which showcases Simone's beautiful voice! I can't name enough songs from this album. Though I have to agree a bit of a down side are the death grunts, but after a few listens you can get past them and you can just fall in love with it because it is a brilliantly put together album!"
4,Really nice sound,"I bought this CD on a friend's recommendation and I was NOT dissappointed. I am a fan of many genres of music but Goth/Symphonic Metal is my favorite. In my opinion, Never Enough is the best song on the CD followed by The Obsessive Devotion and Sancta Terra. I found the CD to be very listenable front to back. If you like a layered metal sound with haunting vocals (Simone Simons has a beautiful voice and range) you will like this CD. I plan on seeing them when they come here on their tour."
2,Terrific music until the grunts ruin it,"I totally agree with the earlier reviewer - musically Epica is wonderful, the music is epic metal and sheer brilliance, with Simone's vocals never been better. But the moment those grunts come in, the whole album is ripped off of my player and tossed into the amazon marketplace. It's a matter of taste, I understand, but I find nothing musical, interesting, or in any way palatable about listening to someone gargling to the music. If I wanted to hear singing Uruk'hai I'd watch the LOTR outtakes. But to my way of thinking (and listening) the grunts/roars/growls ruin a fantastic album. Too bad bands like this can't make two versions - one with the growls for those who are into them, and one without so that the rest of us can really get into the epic symphonic rock and won't miss out on what bands like this are doing. But for my money, I'll stick with the female-fronted bands that don't insist on injecting the growls into their work."
2,Why? WHY? WHY!!!?,"Does anyone actually LIKE death growls? Is this some sort of male domination thing? I mean, Epica has one of the most beautiful voices in all of rock to front them, and anyone with any sense would give the microphone to her and let her rip! Death growls always sound the same.Figure it out, Epica! Geez."
3,"Derivative, noisy, and a massive disappointment. I'm bummed","I agree with Steele. The music is immaculate, and Simone just keeps getting better, but the growls simply RUIN this album. I loved Consign to Oblivion, but this one turned me off right from the second track.It is simply too formulaic, and even worse, totally derivative of so many other bands in this genre. Having just returned from ProgPower in Atlanta this past weekend, I have certainly had enough growling and maniacal double bass drum pounding to last until next year.Mark Jansen, the leader of Epica, is the brother of Floor Jansen of After Forever, as well as one of the former leaders of that band. Epica could go its own way and become a unique entity, but instead, he feels compelled to take them in the direction of follower, instead of leader in its own right.What a huge waste of talent"
4,could be better,I am not sure what Epica is trying to do. The cord structure and mix of metal and opera is great. Simone has a wonderful voice and is clearly well trained. But the growling gets old fast. It is simply too much and ruins the effect of the music. Also there are sections that the machine gun guitars are also over done. These things make the album hard to listen to in one sitting. Do not get me wrong it is still good. Epica has incredible potential. They are al greatly talented. I do wish that the had more albums in the US.
4,For the love of Harry,What else can be said this is a fantastic collection of the Harry Nilsson that caused the Beatles especially John Lennon to trumpet his talents.
4,Best of Nilsson,I had all of Nilsson's music on vinyl and have been updating ny collection to cd.Love all of his workThe sound quality on this cd is excellentOrdering is always easy with Amazon and delivery is on time
2,Frustrating but promising designs,"I breezed through the author's beginner origami books so I thought I would be ready for this intermediate book. Wrong. Even the ""easy"" designs (one or two stars on a scale of one to four) were frustrating. I would cruise through a third or half way through the design and then hit a step that I could spend more than an hour on and still not figure it out. Very frustrating because I was excited to do some of the bug designs for my sons.If you are an advanced intermediate, you will probably enjoy this book very much because it has many cool designs for birds and bugs. But if you struggle at all at the intermediate level, avoid this book unless you don't mind approaching an expert or watching a video to get you over the humps you will undoubtly encounter."
3,Reversal of Fortune,"""Nothing Changes Under the Sun"" was a journey through exciting soundscapes accompanied by the undoubtable musical skills of Andy D. Only on the vocal tracks did the album occasionally dissapoint and sound bland and uninspired.Great was my surprise then when I picked up a copy of ""Man Mountain"" just to find it a complete reversal. Here, the vocal tracks are melodious and haunting, downright beautiful in places. The instrumentals on the other hand sound dull and flavourless compared to the excellent work on his debut. Only occasionally do they hint at greatness. Ultimately, this album makes you yearn for his next release, because you can feel that there's another gem lurking beneath the surface waiting to emerge.Mind you, it's still a decent album and the tracks ""Only Today"" and ""What We've Won"" are worth the price of the album alone."
3,Blue States - Man Mountain,"After the marvelous Nothing Under the Sun, Blue States gives us their second album Man Mountain, and it's somewhat disappointing. Even though the first track, ""Metro Sound,"" brings the same sonic quality that made their first album so wonderful, the rest of the album slips by with nothing that really catches your attention. Part of the problem may be the vocals; while Tahita Bulmer is a competent enough singer, Mr. Dragazis may be relying too much on the vocals to carry the song, rather than having the song present for the vocals to enhance. ""Only Today"" is poppy and moves beautifully but leaves and empty feeling after it finishes. The chorus effect on ""Season Song"" is an intriguing touch, but it pales in comparison to any one of the tracks on Nothing Under the Sun. It's not to say that this album is bad -- I was simply hoping for another stunner."
5,More stellar Blue States,"I loved ""Nothing Changes Under The Sun"" and this one is a little different but every bit as good. More ambient, less vocal, still trippy and descriptive. Blue States is making some of the most beautiful and hypnotic stuff in electronic music today. I say buy it."
2,There are better choices,"I am a nursing student currently using this book for pharmacology in Med-Surg I. After having worked through 7 chapters, I am not fond of this book. The authors have set it up in alomost a circular manner so that you are searching all over for the information you need. Some of the informatrion is too simple and doesn't help create a good understanding of the material. There are no pictures of cell membranes or flow charts for drug action that would help reinforce the learning that is supposed to be taking place! It's simply tedious reading that takes way too much effort to get the most out of it!"
1,What an awful book,this is probally the worst book i have ever read it is extremly boring it is very predictable and the same things keep happening it is not exciting at all i most defintnely do NOT recommend this book
3,only so-so,"Laura Harvey and two of her friends, Yaz and Ruth, plan on spending part of their Gap year travelling to Spain. But then Ruth's boyfriend comes along, and the trip starts going downhill. All he wants to do is stop at junky, touristy, restaurants where ""the prices are in English,"" and cheap, dirty motels so he can ""spend some time"" with Ruth. And since he's driving, he gets the casting vote. But then a Bella, who Laura and Yaz meet in a hotel restaurant, offer to let them stay in their villa to take care of it while they go to the States. They take them up on it, and their trip changes for the better, especially when they meet Juan, the caretaker's son. He's a total dish, and Yaz and Laura both fall for him. But will Juan pick one of them? And if he does, will it change the girls' friendship? This book is flat, but funny, and you can easily finish it in one sitting. I was expecting more zing from the cover, but I've read worse."
3,It Gets Better,"I started to read the book, after I had found it and was ecstatic to find out that it was written by the same author that wrote Grecian Holiday. But the beggining was really slow and it didn't get good until about the middle of the book."
2,Bummed.,"I was so excited to get this one.The original version is so darn good. Strings, a cool melody, a cool beat, no singing. Exactly what chillout should be. I thought remixes of strings and the cool groove beat were gonna be awesome. I was very disappointed when it turned out to be just remixed with the typical trance thump, thump, beat. Nothing innovative, just the cheap easy way out. Shame on the guys who destroyed such a great piece of chillout. They could have done so much better."
5,Great Jumping off Point for YOUNG / NEW Dead Heads,"Look... if you LOVE the Dead, I mean really LOVE them... then you're way past this collection. This is a great sampling of a large part of the band's catalog, and I would say anyone who is looking for a good ""1st"" Dead listen... YES this is a good collection. From here though, you will want to go out and get all the albums that this CD takes its songs from."
4,Nice collection,"77-90 were enigmatic years for GD. They were the best touring act around, but I can't say the same for their studio albums (except for in the dark). The songs are good, but I've never heard a studio cut that didn't sound better live. They did put out several albums in this 13 year period, and the best of it is here. There are some great songs that you would be silly to overlook. The Arista Years takes the best from an era that was not the best. It comes together as a nice 2 hours of music. This album is also a great deal, cuz almost all the songs from In the Dark and Built to Last are included. i recommend this."
3,"Good Tunes, taken out of context","This anthology is OK if you are not serious about the Grateful Dead music and just want to dabble with the hits. But you will be missing out on a huge amount of very fine tunes if you buy this and skip the albums from which the collection was culled. Instead, buy each of the featured albums when you can. Listen & enjoy. There is a lot to be gained by bypassing the short-cuts (-;"
2,Doesn't come across,When I got this package I was excited that it would blow me away. It didn't. Not a single highlight on this as it travels through the most depressing years for the Dead.
1,Out of the mouths of babes....,"I am adult age and fully agree with the 11 year old reviewer; this book was a huge disapointment! There is too little detail about the horse and no real feeling involved. Man O'War was an all-time marvel; is it too much to ask for some of that story? Was this a designated project with historical reasearch or time limited? I had planned to purchase the entire series, this is the end of that idea."
5,EXCELLENT!!,I had forgotten I never got this book. I've been searching for this book for a LONG time to complete my collection of this series on the famous racehorses. And I was NOT disappointed at all!
3,Smells a little musty,"Smells a little musty, but otherwise in good shape. Cannot seem to get the musty smell out. i i i"
5,Great stuff,"This is my third pair of these shoes. I wear them every day and they go everywhere. I have heard that the Goretex is overkill, but in the Northwest Goretex is a way of life, and absolutely the bomb for shoes. My feet never get wet in the rain or snow, yet they can breath on a long hike or in the warm weather we get one month a year."
3,Shoes were too small,"I ordered these shoes for my son. He wears a size 10 but the Merrell's were too small. The Merrell store in Nashville stated these shoes do run small, which I did not know. I also wanted to exchange the shoe but Track N Trail stated I would have to get a refund, THEN order again. I did return the shoes but chose not to reorder."
4,PLEASED OVERALL,"REPLACES ORIGINAL MIRRORS PERFECTLY BUT HAD WRONG SCREWS TO MOUNT TO ORIGNAL ANCHORS IN DOOR, SO HAD TO BE VERY CAREFUL IN REMOVING OLD MIRRORS TO REUSE OLD SCREWS."
5,An unexpected treasure.,"The song, ""Where Do You Go To, My Lovely"" has been haunting me for about 30 years. I bought the CD willing to pay the price to get that one song. This CD is full of good stuff. ""Letter to a Friend"" hits close to home. ( A bulls eye, actually) though the exact circumstances may differ, we all have a close friend that we've treated unfairly. Of the two dozen or so tunes on the disc, there are none that I'll skip. I don't know why Peter Sarstedt isn't more widely known."
4,A Pleasant Plethora of Sounds,"Bran Van 3000, an odd ball collection of non-musicians and some special guests, bring a debut filled with a variety of pleasant songs. Bran Van can either be considered an extremely original band or just a band who borrow styles from such diverse areas and combine them in very original ways. There are combinations of styles from country, hip hop, drum n bass, rap, rock and just about any other styles the members of bran van could get there hands on. Most of the songs on this CD I find to be incredible, however it does have a few fillers. If you're looking for something a bit different, with a ton of musical styles, this is a great album to try"
5,This has to be the best album EVER,I took a bit of a chance buying this album after only hearing 1 song but it was well worth it. BV3 take hip hop to a new level. This album is fantastic. You won't be dissappointed!
3,"Just ""OK""","Some fun listenable ballads like ""Drinking in LA"" and ""Supermodel"" but all in all too many forgettable tracks and confused interludes. There's probably a better record in them."
3,A Mixed Bag,"This record is difficult to review. Bran Van 3000 create interesting, original music, melting a lot of diverse styles in one album. ""Glee"" combines pop, hip hop, rock, electronica, country and easy listening (I probably forgot something), and as a whole is works as an unique, weird, flawed yet addictive effort. Each song here is quite different from one another, the band has male and female vocalists and at times there are some filler moments. When it`s good, it`s really good, like the lo-fi pop of ""Problems"", the absorbing ""Rainshine"" or the chaos presented in ""Forest"". ""Old School"", ""Willard"" and ""Mama Don`t Smoke"", however, would do better as b-sides.""Glee"" is an eclectic mix, a bit too long and pointless at parts but with enough moments of brilliance to make it a recommended debut of the late 90`s. 3,5 stars."
1,One hit wonder,"I have to admit ""Drinking in LA"" got me. That song was so good that I surfed straight to Amazon and bought the CD. A few days later I unwrapped the package and cranked up the stereo to hear my new favorite song. The rest of the music on that CD was so awful that my stereo actually got sick. Is there a doctor in the house? Once again I feel cheated by one hit wonders. When will I learn?"
1,Awful Noise,"This album is some of the worst noise ever recorded. The only good (and radio-friendly) song is ""Everywhere"". Every other track is horrible, horrible noise. It's basically a patchwork of samples that don't even make 'music' when put together. I would give it one-third of 1 star. After I forced myself to listen to the entire thing, I gave it to my dog to go bury in the backyard. For the love of God, don't waste your time!!"
5,Bran Van Y3K,Glee has everything... probably the most eclectic CD I have in my entire collection. There's a lot of rap but it's done completely different from any rap artist I've ever heard. The track 'Old School' starts off completely 80's metal and then busts in with some porno-funk noise... it's my favorite track on the album. Then there's the 'Drinkin' In L.A.' tune that will get anyone singing along... towards the end there's even some stuff that twangs on the country side but the lyrics keep it from being stupid... 'Mama Don't Smoke' (too much dope) is a great way to end the CD. There's something on here for everyone!
4,A little something for everyone!!!,"This CD is just fabulous! I first heard of them through the one song they had on the ""Practical Magic"" soundtrack. I bought the ""Glee"" CD and was really surprised to hear all the diffrent type of sounds this group is capable of. I have never been a fan of hip hop but this band has helped me make the cross over. There are also great tracks that have some techno, reggae, folk and even country influnences. I know it sounds like a weird mix but BV3 makes it work very well. You have to give 'em a try. Trust me you'll like it. This is a great band with a lot of talent and a dynamic sound!"
4,"Norelco HQ8010 Quadra, Spectra, Speed-XL, & SmartTouch 12V car charger","The charger is just what my son-in-law has wanted for years. He shaves in the car on the way to work and this charger does the job keeping the shaver charged. Ordering was simple, received the product on time, and just what I ordered."
2,Astronomy,"Myths and marvels of astronomy: It appeared to be all about astrology not astronomy, therefore I was disappointed in the content."
3,No replacement blades,"I have used this razor for over a year. It is a great shaver, but I have had problems finding replacement blades for this model. I need to change about twice a year, and I can not locate these blades even on the internet. Cost savings???"
4,Expectations pleasantly Fulfilled,Most of the tunes will be familiar to longtime Yellojacket fans but the surprise was the addition of the spin and wildlife
1,This business does not deliver!,"I never received the product. I ordered this for a Christmas delivery and e-mailed them twice when I did not receive this Christmas gift. I have never heard from them. Today is Jan 16, 2007 and I have not received the product or even heard from this outfit."
1,Doesn't Work,"Bought it new and it never worked. I thought the first time I tried it the battery was bad. I put it up, took it out several months later, doesn't work. Keeps going to ""reverse polarity"" light, but it is hooked up correctly. Piece of junk."
4,better than O Samba Pocone,"When I bought a previous album by Skank, I was a bit disappointed (although I appreciate it more now). Therefore, I was a bit hesitant to buy this album. Via Napster I listened to the hits Tres Lados and Balada Do Amor Inabalavel (ex-no.1 in Brazil), which I both liked, so I bought it. And I must say that I'm very happy with this one. Maybe not the traditional sound of Brazil, but more indie, but I think some tracks would be really great in a club. Especially the title track bursts with energy (it gives me the same feeling as Prodigy-tracks, although their music is nothing like the Prodigy), and the whole album is certainly worth a try."
3,Not as strong I bond as I needed.,"This would probably be good for mounting photos in an album of on mat board for framing.I bought it for temporarily joining two pieces of wood for sawing, drilling, and milling two identical pieces. It is not strong enough for this purpose, so I will go back to using carpet tape."
3,OK for Holding Small Objects,"I tried to use this tape on my car's windshield. It was a no go. I have curtain shades that attach in the middle with velcro once you slide them horizontally. Well one of the hold downs lost its grab and won't stay. The tape just stays there while the hold down unglues and travels towards the middle. Well now, I am going to try the adhesive used for the rear view mirror. I am hoping that does the trick. I guess this tape cannot withstand the tensile strength and the heat in Phoenix combined. I haven't tried using it indoors where it is cooler. My guess it will perform much better."
2,"I don't think I'd call it ""permanent"", not strong","I bought this to help stick down the bumpers around my coffee table after my baby was able to pull of the corner pieces. This tape was described as strong so I got it. However, it was not as strong as I was lead to believe. This did not work at all for the purposes of sticking the bumpers to the coffee table. I have not used this for other purposes, so I am giving it two stars because I imagine it might work in other situations."
5,Nice Caribean Weather,"I my opinion, the best of the recent DVD-releasings of two great WRs concerts from the golden years with Jaco Pastorius on bass. Amazing performances and caribian feel from the percussion duo Baderena and Acuna! (Why did Zawinul and Shorter change this winning team?) I will highly recommend this DVD - a must for all WR fans and the rest!"
2,Great Music - Lousy Video,"I remember seeing Weather Report right after Heavy Weather came out. It was around the same time that I saw Return to Forever touring in support of Romantic Warrior. I've so badly wanted to relive those days and was very excited when this video came out to do so. Here's the rub - excellent music and crap film work. I got so upset during watching this it ruined it for me. I wanted to find the folks that shot the video and shake them asking what the hell they were thinking. Shots of Wayne's nose and Joe's crotch? And where is Jaco? However, beggars can't be choosers and if you want to experience the magic that was weather report this DVD is better than nothing."
2,Jaco fans Stay Away!!!!,"If you are a true WR Fan, skip it. It's very disappointing in two integral aspects.One, Alex Acuna is on drums, and he's all over the place in his playing.Two, Jaco must have pissed off the camera men, or they just didn't like all the attention he usually gets, because in the entire program I think he is shown maybe five minutes straight. You hear him for sure, but he's no where to be seen. The cameramen rather show his fingers than a waist up shot even during his solos."
5,The pictures and poetic blessing take you back in time.,"I have found myself on a quest for simple things since the birth of my own two children. When I am in need of purchasing a gift for the birth of a child, I find that I want to present something unique and memorable. This book fits those qualities to a tee. The simple yet beautiful blessing coupled with timeless illustrations beg to be looked at over and over again. In a time when new mothers become caught up in the fast pace of a new child, this book causes one to pause and reflect on a time that has been misplaced but which can be re-captured."
5,A Baby Blessing,"This is an amazing book and I give it to every friend who has a new baby. They always think it is priceless, and in turn start giving to their friends who have new babies."
2,Not what advertised.....,This product is advertised as a lubricant but does not contain any lubricant ingredient. There is a propellant as with any aerosol can. There is a small amount of alcohol for aid in cleaning.....BUT absolutely no lubricant.
4,Norelco AL80 Razor Lubricant,"I've only used this razor lubricant for a couple months, and I also have a new head on my razor. My shaves are closer than they used to be. I will continue to use the lubricant, and see of my razor head lasts longer than before and if it continues to give a closer shave, as I expect from this product."
1,"Received Damaged, Defective, or Wrong Items","The shipped product is not the same as pictured in the Amazon advertisement. The cans shipped not only are an older model with inferior spray heads but one can is dented and two cans plastic caps (covers) were broken with a spray head bent. This shipment is unacceptable. If I wanted the older model with small spray heads I would have bought them local. I want to return the shipment at your costs and receive a full refund or preferably you express ship at your costs the correct new model as pictured on the Amazon web site, picture of the new improved spray head as advertised is attached."
1,No way!,No way I am going to pay $4.10 for shipping on an item that cost $3.90!And the owners manual said to use mineral oil to lubricate the heads.
5,so far so good,"It does make a difference to use the lubricant once a month, it helps the razor to keep the smoothness in every shave."
4,revives blades,"does seem to revive the blades, use about once a week or so to clean out the dust/hair, not sure if i would buy it alone but works for being part of a package"
3,This is a fine story if you love the English village life,"Miss Read invites us to a sleepy village quite far from London -- or wait, is it really sleepy? As the story unfolds at a leisurely pace, we discover that the usual emotions seethe beneath the surface. Septimus is a fine, wise pater familias, although his high principles may hurt a few of his struggling family members. Edward, the nephew, clearly deserves the patrimony because of his humilty, strength, and essential goodness. Sigh."
3,heater,"I thought this heater had a timer, but was mistaken, so am a little disappointed. It does heat up really quickly and blow out a fair bit of air, but makes a few funny clicking sounds as it cools down (i think its some part of the heater contracting)."
3,bonaire heater,this was a replacement for an older heater that was almost alike. My wife loved the original heater and so did I because it wasn't too ugly and it was quiet. Previous heaters were very noisy. This was new and improved but really they just addedcomplication. They included a very unneccessary remote control so you have one more stupid remote to loose. If you don't use the remote you have to cycle through all the settings to turn it off. This is really a drag. If I had known this I wouldnot have purchased it. If you can stand the stupid remote it is a good heater.
1,"FIRE HAZARD, look out!","We got this heater to replace a very old one, to heat our 12'x12' living room. Nothing too extreme. Used it according to directions and all.It does a good job heating! That much I can say. The double-angled heating feature is nice too.But it is LOUD. I mean LOUD, to the point of being distracting while having a conversation or watching the teevee.The loudness was tolerable for our needs, but the shoddy electrical workmanship is what ruined this heater for me. After we owned it for about a month I noticed a strange fishy-plastic smell, and found that it literally melted the wall electrical socket it was plugged into. The plastic around the plug's prong was brown and melty too.Fortunately this thing didn't burn my house down. Hopefully it doesn't burn yours down, either!!"
2,Not good,"My unit had shut itself off for no reason several times. This is a huge problem, since I woke up in a freezing room. Other problems: loud popping noises when it stops heating, no rotation limits the coverage, remote isbadly designed. I am returning it."
1,Stay away from this book!,"I'm a computer science major at a university and unfortunately I have to spend the rest of this semester with this book! This book is horrible! The code is ill documented and difficult to understand, many of the functions written in earlier chapters get referenced in later chapters without note, and the binding of my copy completely fell apart in less than a month! I strongly urge anyone reading this review to think twice about purchasing this book. If you really need a data structures book check out the one written by Nell Dale."
2,Not worth the money,"This book is unfortunately not worth the price to pay. I had the misfortune of buying it because it was required for a data structures class at my school. My main problem with it is that it does not use the STL versions of the classes in the book. The author writes his own versions that do not conform to the standard. This presented a large problem when I went to use the concepts from the book in a program. I got tons of compiler errors until I finally got mad and looked up the STL version documentation. To my surprise, this book uses different function names and different function signatures in many cases. I would say that it is a decent book for learning the concepts, but as far as using them is concerned, you'll need to look elsewhere."
1,Dreadful introduction to data structures and algorithms,"This is one of the worst books I have ever come across. I was forced to study it for one semester for a course in Data Structures and Algo..and it really was painful going with this book as my only guide. Finally had to give up on this and got myself Introduction to Algorithms by Cormen et. al. to relieve myself of the trouble I was going through with this .... There are a lot of weaknesses to this book the most glaring of which is the lack of depth in which the subject has been treated by the authors. The code examples are very poorly documented and most subjects are given a very superficial treatment, certainly not the kind of reference one is looking for when trying to understand a subject. I would strongly recommend that you stay away from this book and go get yourself some decent book which does justice to the subject and doesn't treat it in the frivolous manner in which the authors have treated it in this book."
2,If you are trying to learn on you own...DON'T BUY THIS!,"I'm taking a DS class and this book is required. I wouldn't use it otherwise. The author, as others have said before, jumps around so much that it is really hard to follow sometimes, especially if you don't have days to spend figuring out what is assumed by the author.Interestingly, I found a copy of a much older data structures book by the same author. It's for the C language, but is almost identical. The difference is classes for the implementation, but most everything else is the same.I get the idea, after looking at other DS books for C++, that this one is just a port from C to C++ without much extra thought involved.I'm having to use another book from the school library to learn from, and following the design for the structures in this book for my assignments. It is really frustrating!Good luck if you have to use it."
2,Not a very good refernce.,This is not a book that can easily be used as a reference source. Program functions are taken from previous chapters making it very difficult to follow the flow of a program example. Forcing you to page through the text to find the information that you need.
3,Be careful,"I find a lot of bugs of the logic of the examples in this book, so you must be careful this book is not a bible, instead of this , there is a lot of good stuff."
5,a well-writen introductory book on data structures,"Personally ,as an introductory book on data structures , i found the book superb . First ,because its succeeds in giving incentives to study the subject-matter through interesting and concrete examples. And secondly attention has been put in making reading as easy as possible through drawings and coloring text. Lastly the author ""promotes"" nicely the concept of the ""structure"" in programs and shows it's importance throught the text."
1,Programming Book from Hell,"This book is horrible. It's badly written code wise and also in a literary sense. The author takes good examples and ruins them. Also he makes up his own terms to replace supposedly bad ones. The code is poorly written and contradicts the authors supposed ""style."" He make use of breaks when ever possible, and then tells you that the use of breaks is not good practice. He also typedef's beyond reason. I would strongly recommending NOT buying this book. I unfortunately had an equally idioic teacher who requried this book.. be warned steer clear."
1,A real good doorstop or paper weight.,"The logic behind the data structures presented is brief, and when you want understanding you have to use other texts, so it really does not live up to its purpose, of teaching data structures in C. The book is not well organized."
1,get away from this BOOK,"because of my limited english, i never write any review before. however, as i found this book,i feel that i must comment it for other's benefit. this book is the worst i ever studied. it's very confusing. after reading it, it only taught me to hate c programming."
4,Shape cardio 1,"I bought this music from a local store when it first came out. I have walked, on treadmills, tracks, and in my neighborhood and the music that is on this tape/cd always perks me up. It makes me want to move even if I am tired. Like one of the songs says""You've got to move it, move it"" and it makes me move."
2,Too slow for me,"I go to an advanced-step aerobics class at my gym. We usually work with songs with a 140-145 bpm. I'd heard that this was a great CD for that type of class...boy was I fooled!! It is just way too slow for me. The highest bpm in this CD is 126. We don't even warm-up to that! I know, the CD even said ""Moderate Pace"", I should've known. Also, these songs are very lame. I don't know what happened to SHAPE this time. These songs can be anything you want, but hits they are NOT. Anyway, if you really want a CD for an fun, fast-paced aerobic work out, I don't recommend this CD."
5,Excellent book about the pitfalls of revenge!!,"MacDonald's story tells us what happens once Goldilocks leaves the 3 bears' house.Simply told, with adorable pictures, this book is sure to be on every teacher's shelfas a follow-up to any telling of ""The 3 Bears.""Gwyneth's Williamson's illustrations are bold and will easily hold any child's attention.Children will also learn that revenge sometimes hurts poor, defenselss creatures ;-)"
5,"Good heavens, you have to smile!","I thought this book was very amusing, witty.I was a little sorry to see those adult readers that were up in arms over its morality when you think that the original Goldilocks wasn't any more moral. You might as well erase 90% of fairy stories when you get right down to it!Anyway, children that have the privilege of reading books are usually the educated ones that are able to make moral decisions! What about all the unprivileged children?We are talking about fairy tales.."
2,Nice try,"This book was an interesting twist on an old story. I did like the lighthearted humor of the book, but I'm not so sure it would be appropriate for children, unless you address some of the issues after reading the book (such as vandalism, revenge, and apologies). MacDonald had a nice concept of following up on a classic, but it could have been done better. There is no apology for breaking into the wrong house and vandalizing the property of someone else. It teaches a poor lesson about revenge. The illustrations were good, not great, but pretty decent."
1,Inappropriate and Offensive!,"My child loves the original story of the Three Bears, so when our librarian recommended ""Beware of the Bears"" I thought it sounded fun. I was wrong. After a page or two I stopped reading this book to my young child. It showed the three bears at what they thought was Goldilock's house, pouring cereal on the floor, jumping on her couch so hard they made a hole in it, and continuting to destroy items and mess up every room in the house. This was not a simple tale of eating someone's porridge or sitting in a chair, but vandalism that was approved of by the little bear's parents!This book made vandalism and revenge seem like acceptable things to do, and to make matters worse, it turned out that the bears were not actually in Goldilocks house, but by accident they had ransacked the wolf's house. There was no apology or remorse.I think this book should be thrown out! A terrible sign of our times!"
2,"Bland, not much nutrition","I was disappointed in this product. Really bland, not much nutrition, boring. I am going to donate the rest of my boxes to a shelter."
4,The ballads are timeless but...,"...unfortunately I can't say the same for the uptempo New Jack Swing-esque tracks. ""In The Mood"" went on to become a top-charting hit for The Whispers and a staple of Quiet Storm radio shows. ""Love's Calling"", the superb ""Give It To Me"" and the title track are all superior examples of Soul seduction and romanticism (which hold their own very well in comparison to any of the group's '70s ballads). In short, this CD should be in your collection but buy it for (and enjoy) the romantic ballads."
5,Their best work,This is their best work. I can listen to this from beginning to end. If you love the Whispers this is the one for you.
5,"Its Cooper, of course it gets 5!","Here we have a very nicely presented dvd package. Disc 1 is a great documentry of the legends career with interviews and live footage. Quality. Disc 2, now then...this is a bit of fun; it offers very up to date interviews and cool rare live footage only accesable via an interactive game of snakes and ladders! Bizarre but appealing. However it does grow very tedious wen u want to see the xtra footage and have to go through this process.This is the one and only problem with a great dvd. An awesome package for any fan of alice's work."
1,I must have a bad copy of this DVD. No one else seems to mention the horrid video quality.,"Is it possible that I have a crappy copy of this DVD of Alice Cooper's Prime Cuts, or is everyone just looking past this eyesore of video quality?I could imagine maybe a few poor videos of the earlier songs, but even the later videos (""Poison"", ""Het Stupid"", etc.) look just as crappy as the rest of the DVD. Even the dialogue of Alice and other people involved with Alice Cooper talking between the songs is of horrid video quality.Yes, I'm convinced now. My DVD of this Alice Cooper collection just has to be horribly defective. Because, there is no way every else can seem to tolerate this collection so favorably and disconcerned, if they are watching what I am watching. This DVD has to go back."
2,prime cuts lacks song footage,"Prime Cuts is a pretty good DVD if you want to find out about Alice Cooper as in interviews.....but apart from that it is very disappointing as you get hardly any song footage, as for the Jukebox its a waste of time as you start getting into the song and then it cuts off as you only get a taste of the song, which is very frustrating! I was pissed off.The Coopergame is annoying and the songs you actually get to see in whole form are still made around interviews and the song footage is poor quality.If you want to see Alice cooper in action do not buy this DVD buy Brutally Live.I paid $60 Australian Dollars for this DVD as i expected to see all the songs featured as whole songs not clips! I feel ripped off!"
4,The best vintage Alice available,"If you need proof to give your friends that Alice Cooper was among the best bands in the world, this is it. The majority of this VH-1 style documentary is pre-1975 footage of the original band hammering out the classics live in a way that Alice has never really duplicated since. Todays Alice and the Alice Cooper band are different animals, and if you weren't there the first time around, you'll wish you were after watching this. Alice's interview segments are very funny and insightful, but my only problem was there was no interviews with the original band members. They are spoken of as if they're all dead! A small complaint, when pretty much all the classic tunes are represented in their original live forms. After watching this you'll never look at Marilyn Manson the same way again."
5,excellent group of guys,"I am from the same city in Louisiana where River Road is from and I have become friends with them. They still play at a club that a friend of mine ownes ""Delta Grand"". I am very excited to see the guys doing this well and I think the CD has been a great seccess for them. I know that the band is in the studio now doing the second CD and from the songs that ive heard so far it will be an even bigger seccess."
5,loved the cd too bad nashville didn't get behind this band very nice harmony's very tight band,really loved this cd if nashville would have done more for this band I beleive they could have been a house hold name. Still love them anyway!!
3,Falco is Spencer in Imperial Rome with meddling relatives,"My father gave me the first in this series, ""Silver Pigs,"" and I've kept up with it ever since. Davis isn't Elmore Leonard. Plot developments are slow, things get wordy sometimes, and the climaxes are less than astounding, but she knows Rome c. 72 a.d., her characters are winning, and getting there is all the fun. I'm going to stick with it at least to the eruption of Vesuvius (I'm betting that's where the series is headed, and it'll be a treat). One thing I have to give Davis credit for, she's filled her mystery stories with enough complications to last an empire."
4,"Pretty good, but not the best","I always look forward to a new Falco novel. This one had to wait a while because I was hung up on Last Act. Time to Depart went quickly, but this one seemed to drag again. I guess I think Marcus and Helena need to stay in Rome more. The traveling seems to drag the story down too much. I don't remember feeling that way about the earlier books in the series, but Last Act was really bad. I stopped half way through it and let it lay for six months. This one didn't sit that long, but it did take the better part of a week to read and that seems like a little too long.I did like the interplay betwen Falco and Helena. I missed Petronius and Falco's family. The books just seem to flow better when set in Rome. I hope the next one, which I am eagerly awaiting returns to the seven hills."
4,A Hard-Boiled Roman in Spain,"Marcus Didius Falco roams again through ancient Europe to trap one more or less dangerous criminal. Although Davis uses quite often anachronisms, her novels are always enjoyable. There might be better Falco-novels and for the historical context she can't beat Steven Saylor's ""Roma Sub Rosa"" mysteries or John M. Roberts' ""SPQR"" sequels, but her humor and Chandlerisms make you laugh in a good way. Being an expert in Roman mysteries, I can recommend this novel for everyone who needs a refreshing mystery/suspense or who wants to get a superficial insight into the ancient Roman Empire. For those who also want historical accuracy, stay with your Steven Saylor or John M. Roberts novels."
2,Falco in Search of a Plot,"We've all seen detective series that gradually petered out as their authors obsessed with their characters and forgot that, first and foremost, you need a mystery to have a good book. I loved the previous Falco books, and Davis continues to have outstanding historical detail and character development, but I'm afraid that this plot isn't worthwhile. There's more excitement in Helena's pregnancy than in the breakup of a incipient olive oil cartel, and Falco doesn't seem to solve as much as blunder. Here's hoping that this effort was an aberration."
2,Not a favorite.,"I bought these to replace a previous massaging pair, the ones with all the nubs in it. These didn't do it. The bottom has no cushioning at all and the material they are made from cause feet to sweat."
2,Dissapointed,"When I made this purchase I was unaware that it was the English TV version, which does not allow you to watch it in Japanese. So now I have to return it. I was so excited to find both seasons for so cheap and no where on your page says it's the english TV version. And of course I can't open it to see if it has Japanese, I had to come on here and research it. So I am extremely dissapointed."
4,Great Show great set great bargain.,"I payed 25 USD for my product, and I must say this is a very good anime set. Anything above 60 USD$ would be ludicrous and not worth it as you could probably find the box sets separate for a cheaper price. But for the price I payed it is very good. Other shows I have had shell out 35 USD$ just for one season. Season One covers episodes 1 through 27. Season Two covers episodes 28-54. It doesn't have many extras, it does include the episode previews at the end of each show, and does not include the Japanese audio therefore I cannot give this item five stars. But this is truly a terrific show and at a price like this it is hard to beat so if your a casual fan such as my self I strongly urge you to pick it up."
2,Not the best,"While writing for my thesis on ""VoIP for SME's"", I read a couple of VoIP books. The book from Mr. Harte is very brief (and the layout/cover is not very attractive, it seems very outdated). Considering the price of the book, it has a very bad price/info ratio. If you want to read a primer, I would recommend VoIP for dummies. For more advanced reading, try Voice over packet networks from Wright (you need to know the fundamentals, before you read this one!)."
1,Introduction to IP Telephony,Do NOT buy this PDF if you are a serious professional and want to work for VoIP. You will waste your money buying this and waste your time reading this. I do not think I can give even one star to this book. However Amazon does not accept review if I do not give at least one star hence I have give that rating.
2,not what I expected,I ordered this product to replace a similar one lost in a move. I was disappointed by the strength of the magnets. I have henkels (pro S series) knives that slide down when placed on the magnet. The magnet is not adequate to grip tightly.
3,For linguists and anthropologists,"As stated in the description, this is a book for linguists and anthropologists. As such, I give it a 3.5, but am unwilling to round up to a full 4.All readers should note that the Mongolian in this book is a little dated, and/or, flavored by a southern (Inner Mongolian) dialect. If you are looking for general information, this is a good reference; if you are learning Khalkha Mongolian, I cannot recommend this volume to you.Students of Mongolian will be frustrated by the phonetic transcription used in the early chapters of the book, and then be frustrated again by the switch to Cyrillic after a few chapters. Better choices include J. Bosson's ""Modern Mongolian,"" A. Sanders' ""Colloquial Mongolian: The Complete Course for Beginners"" and R. Kullman's ""Mongolian Grammar."" The last of which includes classical script everywhere it uses Cyrillic."
3,Moleskine Reporter,"This is a very nice reporter style notebook with high quality paper that takes liquid gel ink nicely and which doesn't bleed through the back side of the paper. However, at nine to eleven dollars a pop, it gets quite expensive for daily use. If I could find something as nice cheaper, I'd purchase it. So far I have not. Oh, the outside of the notebook is paper not bonded leather. If you put it in your rear pocket, it will wrinkle."
5,An amazing CD!,Junoon: Azadi is the only CD by a Pakistani band which I have ever purchased. After hearing a friend playing it I just HAD to have it. The words and the music absorb you into a world of sound which makes you feel lighter and more content with life in general. The name 'Azadi' meaning freedom does the album justice.It is my definate reccomendation to anybody who enjoys music with some style and meaning.A must buy on my list!
2,Wholly unremarkable,"Acting & production was up to par for a movie of today's caliber, which is why I give this movie more than one star.The entire plot, on the other hand, has been so overdone throughout the years, that creating a movie of this style today would require more imaginative writing. This movie was predictable at many points, and beyond that, did not give me any ""Wow, I never saw that coming!"" moments.Glad I watched it on PPV as the 99-cent special, rather than paying to see it in a theatre. Just never came close to hitting home with me."
4,It had the potential...,I saw this movie in the theaters because of the cast and I thought why not? Boy was I wrong. The movie had such great potential with all the star actors and the plot. It didn't live up to the name and kind of leaves you wondering once the movie is over. It was interesting to watch once but not worth buying.
2,what went wrong,"with joaquin phoenix, mark wahlberg and robert duvall, this movie should have been as riveting as the departed or training day but it wasn't. the opening shot of eva mendes having some five-digit fun turned me off and phoenix' character bobby just grew more and more morose as the film dragged on. i did enjoy the portrayal of the brotherhood among new york police officers because it showed that most of them really are heroes."
4,"Great Entertainment, Excellent Cast!","Joaquin Phoenix really gave it all with his great performance and so did Mark Wahlberg. I am not a Robert Duvall fan, but he was totally believable and loved him. Eva Mendes... not bad, but it just seemed a little too much in my opinion. The story line is rushed in a little and somewhat confusing at time, but overall very entertaining. Normally, I would not rate a gangster movie such as this one because I don't really like them and it wouldn't be fair for people who loves them, but this one I can sincerely say that I enjoyed it until the end."
1,"Slow-moving, ponderous, hopeless movie.","It's remarkable how much hash a director can make of a movie. This one is hash. The plot is sketchy, the characterization shallow, the pace unendurably slow. There is no figurative language other than swear words, no theme other than ""band of brothers"" or ""reunited family with an erstwhile prodigal son.""Two thumbs down. Hash in quantity."
4,"slow start, but intense","The beginning of this film was a bit slow, but I understood as it needed to set the scene for the huge decision Joaquin Phoenix had to make. This was an excellent movie demonstrating family ties, brotherly love (or hate) and how parents choose/pick favorites between their kids. Despite the non-respect Joaquin's character got from his father and his brother, he still stood beside them through it all.Eva Mendes' character was a bit raunchy and the opening scene was a little wide (to be mild). I was unhappy that she left Joaquin without even saying a word...EXCELLENT acting for Mark Walhberg who continues to demonstrate his acting talents as he gets older... Joaquin Phoenix is still extremely intense and he ""owns"" his roles. Remember him from ""Parenthood"" w/Steve Martin?This is a good movie... trust!"
3,"Gritty, Yes, But More Of A Character Study Of A Family","I I have to admit I did not like the first 30 minutes of this movie but I'm glad I stuck with it because it got pretty good...and then better and better! The last hour was riveting in many spots and the movie finished on a high note.Joaquin Phoenix, Mark Wahlberg and Robert Duvall are all terrific, as usual, but I actually thought two of the most interesting roles in here were played by supporting actors Alex Veadov and Danny Hoch. Veadov is Russian thug ""Vadim Nezinski"" as is Hoch nightclub employee-best friend ""Jumbo.""There is an extremely tense and violent car chase scene in this film, along with a shocking sex scene in the first few minutes, but basically it is far more of a character-study film, of the relationships involving the Grusinsky family.If you can get by the first 30 minutes, you'll be rewarded with a good story, even touching at times despite the rough characters."
1,Great actors doing a lousy job,"in a not very good movie. Duvall, usually a marvelous actor is wooden, tired, Wahlberg also usually marvelous, literally phones his lines in and Phoenix who was simply brilliant as Johnny Cash relies on twitches and tics to indicate emotion in his character. A fine bunch of supporting actors given dull dialogue in an even duller plot. An uninspired shame of a movie, not even good enough to be given B status."
1,Clumsy And Pointless,"Joaquin Phoenix broods and cries. Eva Mendes is either going to bed, getting out of bed or sleeping with her hair mussed. Robert Duvall disapproves of everyone and everything. Mark Wahlberg says the 'f' word about 100 times and has all the presence and charisma of a broken chair. It rains a lot. They move from one sleazy hotel to another. That's about it. A total waste. Save your money."
4,"I own ""We Own the Night""","Don't get me wrong this is a very good well acted, directed movie. Here's the but, It has a been there done that feel to it. It tried like hell to be shake up the cops and robbers formular, and maybe that's the problem. As much as I liked it and would recommend this film, if you don't see it your missing a well acted & directed cops and robbers film. It will never make top 100 list of greatest movies ever."
2,we own the rights,"great actors(wahlberg,phoenix and the amazing evergreen robert duvall).a strong story (cops and criminals in a family divided).but let down by a saggy middle, some directionless scenes and some lazy writing (or was it improv?).the terrific eva mendes,a talented actor,is reduced to pouting and looking incredibly glamourous.(maybe that's not so bad)in the end scenes phoenix emerges (..er...phoenix like?) from a smokey reedbed.bit corny no?as the end credits roll i noticed the two leads were also the producers.we own the rights?"
4,"Great actors, great movie",I enjoyed this film. Phoenix always does a wonderful job of acting. The mix of characters were great.
2,Falls off a cliff in the 2nd half,"For the first half of the movie, I found it to be quite good. Up to that point it had a good story, good characters and fine acting. Then, after the pivotal scene of the movie, the story looks like it's written by a couple of high school drop outs. It's really amazing how dramatic the fall off is. At that point it is so bad, I still was able to enjoy it a bit because I could laugh at from that point on."
3,Good acting saves this one,"This story has been done before many times (and better I might add), but Joaquin Phoenix and Mark Wahlberg turn in fine performances to elevate this middle of the road crime film. I was never really bored, but I won't even remember this film a couple of months from now. Don't waste money seeing it in theaters, just check it out when it hits DVD."
3,Good Rental Movie,"I wouldn't buy this movie. But for the $1.49 rental fee, I enjoyed it. I agree with some of the other reviews in that the actors didn't get enough of a chance to show off their talent. Overall it was decent."
3,Not so Hot,"With a cast like Joaquin Phoenix, Eva Mendes, Mark Wahlberg, and Robert Duvall I was really expecting more from this picture. The storyline of two brothers on opposite sides of the law has been done so much better before. Joaquin puts in a good performance. Wahlberg plays the same kind of pissed off character he always does. Eva does the best with what she had. Her role consists of rolling around on a bed most of the movie and looking sexy. Duvall doesn't get that much screen time, but he is solid. The movie is very uneven and has some pretty big gaps in logic. It is entertaining to a point, but don't expect a really terrific movie."
1,We Wish We Didn't Own The Night!,"The creators of this movie stole from the best and then squandered the booty. This movie is 100% derivative without an original element, except for the wildly improbable scene where a citizen is given a gun, a badge, and a police uniform and told to go out there and be a cop. The great Robert Duvall is wasted here; he shows up to recite the script, but forgets to act. Phoenix and Whalberg alternately over-act and forget-to-act. I wondered how two notable young actors ended up in this crime of a movie, then the end credits revealed they both were: ""producers."" Skip this one and rent ""The Godfather"" (where Robert Duvall remembers to act), ""Serpico,"" ""Prince of the City,"" or ""King of New York"" if you want real NYC crime, grit, and drama."
1,wow,"Wow. What a truly crappy movie. Terrible script. Totally unbelievable. And while I appreciate Joaquin Phoenix his acting is so over the top as to appear almost cartoonishly ridiculous. This is truly the worst film I've seen this year, probably because given the cast I had such high expectations."
5,"cops, cops, and more cops......","this movie kind of started out slow, then the action started. if you like action check this movie out it's pretty good. i rate this one 4- stars****"
2,boring and doesn't tie together,The whole thing leaves you thinking - and I care why? I love all the actors - the premise is good - the storyline is weak and just doesn't come together.
2,A Disappointment,"This was a very disappointing film. The actors involved are all very good, and Phoenix and Duvall have been excellent in roles previously; however, the actors got lost in a predictable and boring plot. There really were not any new ideas here. This is a 2 1/2 star film. It is okay to watch, just don't expect to be impressed."
2,"Star studded, but slow","Although Robert Duvall gives his requisite on target performance and Eva Mendes is, as always, soft on the eyes, this movie is a bit slow. It's as if we started the movie in the middle of the characters lives; consequently, you feel as if you missed the back story. For instance, why did the brothers dislike one another so much? Which son did the father identify with and why? At the very least, these questions should have been asked and answered before establishing the central plot. And if you can get past that the movie's not so bad."
3,Only good to watch once.,Very good first half movie. Movie was good all the way up to the end. I thought the ending was very disappointing--predictable
5,Eva Mendes Shines,"Eva, Eva, Eva! Eva Mendes is smoking hot in this movie and holds her own even though she isn't the main star or as experienced as the other actors. The movie focuses mainly on the father/son brother/brother relationship pains in Joaquin Phoenix's cop family. In the beginning of the movie Phoenix is just a regular guy that owns a club and is into the scene and all that that implies. After watching him play this character at the beginning, it is surprising to see how his life takes a sharp turn by the end of the film. Back to my girl Eva, I can't get over how well she did in this film and how fine she was too. If you watch this film for any reason at all make it to see her."
5,Great Movie,I really love this movie. I would recommend this movie to Joaquin Phoenix or Mark Wahlberg fans. I like both actors very much and to see a movie with both actors was a great pleasure.
4,Entertaining police drama,"Hi..I enjoy police / Cops movies alot, some of my favourite movies areStriking Distance,Cop Landand Oscar winnerThe Departed (Widescreen Edition),So i was pretty excited to see this one, which involves a family of Law enforcement officers, and one son who is on the other side of the law, or so it seems !Im not a particular fan of Joaquin Phoenix, but he did a good job in this one, Mark Walheberg was pretty good here, so was Robert Duval,the plot was intriguing, and never dragged or slowed its pace, had some action but i felt like i needed more..Overall, a very entertaining police drama, very good preformances from the cast, a movie worthy of 4 stars, minus one because the lack of more action and a standard sound track which needs more work..Im also excited to see the new police drama starring Keanu reeves which will be released within the next two weeks, its called Street Kings..i can't wait for that one"
4,"The Actors Own ""The Night""","The critics were not especially kind to ""We Own the Night"", but it is really a very enjoyable cop/suspense film. Outstanding performances from Joaquin Phoenix, Mark Wahlberg and Robert Duvall make this a worthwhile venture. Set in the early 80's (great soundtrack, by the way), the film explores the conversion of a bad guy (Phoenix), born into a family of cops, into a hero. Eva Mendes turns in an arresting performance as Phoenix's girlfriend: touching, intense and sexy. The action in this film is stunning. There's a car chase that will make you jump out of your seat. See it. You will not be disappointed. Be aware that the sexuality, language and violence are extremely graphic."
3,Could of been better,"It started nicely then went to hell knows where,It seemed Joaquin Phoenix was going to be the ""bad guy"" which would have been better for the movie.He hears something ""bad"" and tells the police which seems to be mainly made up of family members.At another point he then goes undercover of sorts by wearing a wiretap to a meeting and of course all hell breaks loose.His father gets killed in a chase scene (which I enjoyed how it was filmed).So from there Joaquin becomes what he hates (a cop) then goes on a man hunt with his die hard cop brother.Now his brother was shot in the head but lived and when there is a gun fight near the end Mark Wahlberg goes all loopy and Joaquin goes gung ho.Had me going ""wha?""Worth a rental not a purchase."
1,Mediocre would be a step up for this stinker.,"Great actors, completely used up, lame plot, full of holes. Do not waste two hours of your life watching this movie."
5,A hidden gem,"I was surprised how much I like this film; it's a modern classic. It's suspenseful and sometimes subtle, and the acting is phenomenal. If you're a fan of dark drama, of the family or organized crime variety, then you'll like it."
3,This tutorial was helpful.,"This tutorial was helpful. After watching the DVD's (there are 2), I was able to start using VT(4) right away. I now have confidence in my ability to use VT(4) effectively and have at least a better idea of how much this software package can accomplish. So, I would recommend this tutorial DVD, for anyone interested in using VT(4)."
2,MARKED UP BADLY,"IF YOURE PAYING MORE THAN $2.50 FOR THIS ITEM, YOURE GETTING RIPPED OFF LIKE I DID...DO THE RESEARCH ON THE PRICE OF THIS ITEM ELSEWHERE...I WILL RESEARCH ALL FUTURE PURCHASES MUCH MORE CAREFULLY. BEWARE!"
5,High Energy...yeah baby!,"I definitely look forward to my walks with this music. I have the cassette, and the production quality is very good...seamless transition between tunes and clear headphone sound (much different than the tapes I've made for myself in the past!) I have been fitness walking for several years and I would definitely recommend this to anyone who wants music that gets you walking and keeps you walking!"
5,INSTRUMENTAL VERSION?,This is truely a great song. Does anyone know where I could find the instrumental version of it? Please either post a message or e-mail me stencells@cogeco.ca Thanks! :)-Steve
5,great band!,okay I have to say..........soul decision is awesome! i saw them perform last night here in portland (they opened for christina:) and they were sooooo good! they dont dance around and lip synced like the boy groups and britney spears do.......no they have beatiful voices and write their songs and play various instruments. SO i would suggest you give this fine boys a try!!
3,This will make you move:),"I did not like this song the first time I heard it, but after hearing it every 5 minutes on the radio.....I actually began to love it. It is definetely car/dance music! When you hear this you will be tapping your foot and singing along....this song is just FUN! Not to mention....there are 3 beautiful faces singing it!!!"
5,Sheer Beauty,"This record was a revelation to me. I had heard from some people whose taste I truly admire that I would love this album. I didn't realize how much.Declan's voice is a thing of beauty. The range, the tone, his unique take on vocal intonation is simply gorgeous.The songs are a revelation. So simple, yet so profound, sympathetic, and romantic, all at the same time.Buy this record. You will cherish it for life."
5,A unique book on personal support raising,"Pete Sommer has written an excellent book, especially if you are a single female, minority or international who might have some unique challenges and issues you face. The biblical basis, stories, and examples are very helpful. Thanks Pete for this great book."
4,Good Basic Approach,The book is a good basic approach to relational development as it relates to fundraising. This would be a particularly good read for first time missionaries but so too a good review for all.
4,Track Listing,"Hallelujah, He Is BornThe StarMedley #1The Gift is on the InsideGesu BambinoSong of JosephFor the Love of it AllMedley #2Mary, Did You Know?The MagnificatWhat If Jesus Comes Back Like That?Medley #3O Holy NightGo Tell It on the Mountain"
5,God is Able,"I love the CD it is a good used product and really like new. Would like to know if Ron Kenoly is still recording or what he is doing now, does anyone know?Thanks Amazon."
3,Horrible Binding!! but good pictures...,"I bought this book with the ""I Am Plastic"" bundle, as I do like pixel art. And this book delivers in a huge and well printed collection of icons, and various pixel art - perfect for inspiration of similiar styles. However, when I bought it I did ignore the user reviews that said the binding was bad. Boy was that a mistake. On the VERY FIRST reading of the book after I tore off the shrink wrap and got it out of the Amazon box, this book fell apart from the cover by the time I flicked to the middle of the book. And I was very gentle with the book. The binding is SERIOUSLY FLAWED. I am going to seek a refund from Amazon -- this is ridiculous, there is no way that the first time you read a book it should start to come apart!! Major disappointment to the publisher!!!This printing of the book is malfunctioned or flawed as the binding is horrible. Avoid this edition of the book at all costs unless you want pages coming out all over the place."
4,Outstanding Art. Poor Production.,"The images that lie within this book are simply amazing. Some of the most talented pixel illustration artists have put their work into this compilation. This is a must have for anyone aspiring, or already a pixel artist. That being said...The production of the actual book itself was quite poor. (In my case at least) The binding of my book was falling apart and the cover was already about to fall off when it arrived. While viewing the contents, I have to be extremely careful not to stress out the binding, or else it feels like all the pages could fall out pretty easily. This is my only gripe."
4,Beth is funny,"My first Beth Lisick book but it won't be my last. She's a good writer and if you ever get the chance to see her perform, don't miss it."
2,Not Good,Recorded straight from a vinyl record instead of the master tapes everything about this CD is cheap. The sound quality is passable apart from the first track which sounds like its about to jump its so bad. It sounds here like Jimmy Smith is backing some RnB sax player like Sam the Man Taylor. Not very jazzy and not very good. It only runs to 24 mins as well
1,Beware,"The sound is woeful, it is clearly taken from a rough LP _ the scratches are extraordinary on track one; you wouldn't give someone a homemade tape of this standard. Worse, it's not Jimmy Smith aural evidence, and a little research, suggests it's Dave ''Baby'' Cortez. In fact, Cortez is named in the writing credits."
1,Garbage with no historical value!,"Two reasons not to pay any attention or even considering bying this non-official Jimmy Smith album - 1) Audio quality is so poor that the CD transfer must be from an scratchy LP or cassette 2) Tunes drawn from Baby Cortez albums - no Jimmy Smith album. If you're considering Jimmy Smith albums recorded prior to his solo debut on Blue Note Records in 1955, check out the 1953 -54 recorded albums ""Jug Head"" and ""The Fantastic Jimmy Smith"" with the Don Gardner Trio."
1,Bad sizing,Beware the sizing. What they show as size 6-6.5 is not correct. It was way bigger than a US size 6 or 6.5. Returned the product. Information provided by Amazon was bad.
5,Great replacements,"These were great replacements. I bought Energizer replacements after reading the reviews of the ""less expensive"" batteries and seeing the prices at the retail stores. I needed to purchase 8 for me and my mother so I chose the battery that was least likely to give me any problems. I am very happy with my choice and so is my mother. No more going from room to room while on the phone to look for a handset that I can use more than 5 minutes before the low battery beep. I ordered enough to get free shipping too. Thanks Amazon!"
2,Is it worth it?,"I bought 3 of these batteries last year (literally a year ago) to replace the batteries for the set of phones I purchased at Costco several years ago. The batteries in the phones lasted a few years (approximately 3) before the batteries started dying. Amazon's price for the replacements were truly competitive, but these batteries started dying out a month ago. The batteries were great while they lasted, but the debate is, is it worth it to spend another $30 on replacements or is it better to just spring for a new phone set for double the price?"
3,Lasted less than two years,"Purchased this item at the end of March, 2010 and has been noticably declining since Fall, 2011. Now, in Feb. 2012, it won't hold a charge for more than a couple of hours (of standby - far less when actually using the phone). Since all of these batteries seem to be low-grade knockoffs, I'd say just but the cheapest since none of them last."
3,it's a battery,"What I got is not what is pictured here, that really erks me. I put this in my phone and it seems to be working just fine. The NiMH battery that came with the phone just five short years ago would only last about thirty minutes before dying on me."
1,Does not replace the BT-446,"These batteries did not work for me. My Uniden phone says PowerMax 5.8GHz across the top. Not sure what model number it is. The batteries inside say BT-446. The batteries I received were too small. I charged them for a day and got nothing. I guess they are the wrong.It's not worth sending back at my own expense on the hope that they'll refund my cash.Fool me once, shame on you!"
4,High success rate,I've purchased 8 of these at various times. Better than average battery. Most lasted me 2 to 2.5 years but once in a while I would get a bad one that wouldn't hold much charge after 6 months or less.
5,Easy Replacement,"The batteries arrived as forecast and were installed, no problems.The charge lasts as long as it should for new batteries.Much better than replacing the entire answering/cordless phone set."
1,Not worth the extra money,"Bought this ""Energizer"" product hoping it would work better than the cheap no name batteries I previously purchased and reviewed as not good and this more expensive product does not work any better than the $2-3 versions of this battery. It will not charge in remote charger, it does not hold a charge for any longer than the cheap batteries. My conclusion is if you have to live with replacement batteries like I am doing, just buy the cheap ones and replace them every 6 months. Or, as I am about to do, just buy a completely new phone system just to get new OEM batteries that charge in remote charger and last more than 1 day on a charge."
2,Short Lived,I bought two of these in and used them in different phones. In about 6 months they both would not hold a charge for more than 10 minutes of talk time. I have never experienced anything like this in a NMH rechargeable battery. They worked when I first got them and they did fit the way they were supposed to so I gave them 2 stars. Not sure it matters but they did not look like the picture. They said energizer but had an all black wrapping. These really smell like counterfeits to me. I can't believe the Everready company would risk damaging their brand with a product like this.
1,Poor battery life - a disappointment,"I bought two of these batteries as replacements for my Uniden cordless phones. I bought them in late October, and one is still working. The other died by Christmas, and I'm going to try to return it to Amazon. This is disappointing and a real hassle. I had to hunt around the Amazon website to figure out how to return it, and it's likely they won't give much or any of my money back."
4,Just seeing a brand name makes me more comfortable,"So far the Energizers seem to be better in our 4 cordless phones than the previous plain-wrapped knockoff batteries.I am not comfortable with the no-name batteries. They never seem to last more than two years; I think that's sub-par.I fervently hope the Energizers perform better and longer. So far they take a charge well and hold a charge several days longer than the no-names.With the no-name batteries we were getting a lot of crackling in the phone near the end of each charge cycle. I wasn't able to isolate the problem and blame the batteries specifically, but Voila! The crackling is gone when using the Energizers.Only time will tell, but I'm hopeful these are the best Uniden Cordless phone replacement batteries."
3,"Bought two, only one lasted longer than two years.","These worked fine with my Uniden TRU8885-2 PowerMax 5.8GHz Handsets, but never seemed to last quite as long as the original Uniden BT-446 batteries. After two years, only one of them still holds a reasonable charge (a bit over an hour). The other lasts for less than 20 minutes, even when fully charged. At $12.20 apiece (currently), these are half the price of the Uniden batteries. There are even cheaper alternatives available, but who knows how reliable..."
5,Works perfectly,"My older cordless phones were to a point where they would only hold a sufficient charge for ten minutes of use. I'd pretty much decided to buy a new phone system, when I noticed that replacement batteries were available. About a month ago, I bought two of these batteries for use in my two cordless phones. I followed the instructions and charged them for 24 hours before use; first one phone, then the other, saving the old batteries in case a new battery was DOA.There are cheaper Korean-made batteries available, but, after reading many reviews, I decided buying the more expensive ""Energizer"" ones seemed a far-better bet. The cheaper batteries got a lot of negative reviews as regarding initial power, and battery life durability.In summary, I've been very pleased with the new life of my cordless phones, and, recommend these batteries highly."
5,Energizer ER-P512 NiMH Cordless Phone Battery,This is the second time I've purchase this product. Its what I expect from Energizer batteries long life and quality. I highly recommend this product and will buy again. I purchased 2 for my 2 cordless phones.
5,Great Replacement Battery for my Uniden Cordless,"Fair Price, Good battery, with slightly longer life then the OEM battery it replaced. Cannot speak to overall longevity yet, but so far so good!"
3,Patience....,"Cardboard tube, plastic mirrors, pretty lame instructions but, it works! I bought this intending to turn a wooden body for the thing, and when I do, it should be just fine. For the price, you get what you pay for. I have no complaints about the parts received, my only gripe is the very sparse instructions, but then, this isn't rocket surgery or brain science, it's a cardboard and plastic TOY! It is what it is, doesn't pretend to be anything else, and frankly, these things are fun for a few minutes, then they're put down and forgotten. After a few months, you may run across it again, pick it up, look thru it, then back into the drawer it goes. If you want an inexpensive kaleidoscope, have some patience and put this thing together."
3,Kaleidascope Kit,I loved the idea of a kaleidoscope kit. Sounded crafty and educational. However this kit was disappointing. The parts did not fit together well during assembly and required some trimming with an exacto knife along with a little brute force. Most disappointing was the absence of any literature explaining the optics of a kaleidoscope.
2,Stick WIth Holes on the side,"The problem with this paper is that there are not any holes for putting in a binder. Also, it could be a lot easier to rip out. Most graph paper booklets require a quick tear, with out any rough edges. I found myself with rips here and there as i took sheets from the book.Even if you don't have a binder to put graph paper in, one with holes are always better so you have the option. For the most part, mead is a better choice then Tops in most school/office supply categories."
4,The Way Back,"Carries on from The Dark Dimensions. Back aboard Faraway Quest near a prehistoric Kinsolving's World, Grimes and the loyal faction of his crew must somehow find the way back to their own time and place. It involves some interesting detours through space and time."
4,Electric Razor,"The batteries last a long time and recharge quickly.Floating heads are confortable, but don't seem to shave a closely as my previous Norelco."
3,Another cheap Chinese product...,"Norelco used to be German. The new Norelco is useful and adequate for touch-ups before that important meeting, but don't expect a really close shave. I get about 10 shaves per charge and this is a bear to clean.Norelco seems to be counting its marks so it does not even include a small brush for cleaning the whiskers out of the rotary blades. If it had not been on sale for $49.99 with a $30 rebate (for 2), I would not have purchased 1 each for my son and me."
3,It is just a OK shaver,"I bought this shaver after I read the product review here. I've been using this shaver for several months now. It just a Ok shaver for price.I am above-average hairy guy. Each charge only lasts probably 10 days for me. Again, the shave is not very close, just OK. I paid about 60$ for it... probably that's just what you could expect for the shaver around the price"
5,Great,"This shaver was my first shaver and I got it when I was 15. I really like it because it gives me a close shave and doesn't irritate my skin hardly at all. The trimmer on the side is almost useles, but the rest of the system is outstanding. It doesn't take long to charge and can hold the charge for a long time. It is a great option for anyone to buy and I highly recomend it."
2,Didn't last long...,"Gave this as a gift to my elderly father-in-law. It lasted about a month, and would no longer run. It is made kind of cheap with plastic, and he may have cleaned it with alcohol or something similar that melted the plastic.."
4,Good Shave - For Electric Shaver,"Convenient to use, good battery life, good shave for an electric shaver, but still not as good as a blade. Also a little hard to use at edges, such as sideburns, under and around nose."
2,This stuffs not that great,"I personally recieve a less irritating shave when I use my Norelco Advantage without the ""goo"". I think it (in combination with moisture) makes my skin tense, the razor is then more abrasive. So I dry shave then use a gel after-shave... but I understand not everyone's skin is the same, so there will be people that love this stuff. No doubt it's a high quality product, but it wasn't meant for me."
4,Works for me,"The Nivea for Men shaving lotion works well for me. I have very sensitive skin that breaks out easily. With the Nivea, I don't have the problem. I could not find this product anywhere besides Amazon so I was pleased to have found it."
5,Everyone's Racquet Philadelphia Tennis Pro,"A must have for every tennis player. Take a pattern learn it, do the drills and before you know it you will be the tennis player you always wanted to be."
4,Lots of drills!,Book is pretty much all patterns of play and drills linked to improve those patterns. Good variation of drills. Simple illustrations are easy to understand.
2,Tennis Tactics,"Has more to do about tennis practice drills, then tactics. A good book for someone who is coaching or if you have two hours a day to devote to practice. Book is not meant for the recreational player."
2,"OK, but pretty flimsy","I've owned two Sportline 350's now. The first one lasted a month, then stopped registering steps. After trying to repair it, I threw it out.My second Sportline 350 lasted one day before falling off my belt. It, too, stopped counting steps. This time, my repairs were more successful. The spring inside had popped up against the swinging weight and jammed it. Once I pushed the spring back into the square groove, everything worked fine.I probably wouldn't buy another."
2,Quit working,"The pedometer worked well for approximately the first hour I used it, however sometime during the second hour it quit working. Just a blank screen. Maybe it was a fluke, but I am not going to take my chances with another of the same product."
1,Not -so-happy with my pedometer,I purchased two of the same pedometer for my boyfriend and I and they both stopped working on the same day! We only had them 10 days and when they went kaput!
1,JUNK...No Darn Good,"A friend gave me the sportline trainer (the trainer digital quartz sports monitor, model # unknown) as a gift. After performing all the programming steps, the unit stopped responding after 3 hours of use. I changed the battery and reprogrammed the unit and the same thing happened again after just 2 hours of use and now only the upper half of the digits will display. Don't waste your money or time."
2,Don't waste your time,"I wasn't looking for anything fancy in pedometers, just something that would record my steps accurately. Unfortunately the Sportline pedometer couldn't even do that. It never recorded my steps accurately. It would always tell me that I did more steps than I actually did. Not only that, the thing stopped working after about a month of use. Maybe I got a bad pedometer, but I won't try another one."
3,Try #2,"I first bought this pedometer about 3 months ago. It worked great at first but within the 2nd month, I started to believe it wasn't working. Either that or I wasn't walking/jogging as far as I thought I was! It started to give inaccurate readings of the distance and number of steps. I just bought my 2nd one, I thought I'd give it another try. I like the features it has and it's easy to use. I've had my new one for about 2 weeks and so far so good. If something happens to this one too, I'll update this posting. Maybe the first one was made on a Friday at 4pm, who knows. Maybe this 2nd one will be better."
1,Bad Product-Worse Customer Service,I bought this 5/21/05 got it the first week of June. It never worked so I sent it to the manufacturer. My postal receipt says they got 6/6/05. I finally called 6/28/5 and was told we would get a replacement in 10 business days. That would have been 7/13/05. Called on 7/15/05 and was told yet again it would be another 10 days. Bought this for summer hiking. What a disappointment. What a piece of junk! Buy something local so you can get help from a local store!
3,Great but gone,"This is a decent pedometer. It was easy to program with my stride length and never missed a step. However, it fell off my waistband the third day while I was running errands and was lost forever. Get one with a safety leash."
5,Multiple Uses and a Great Price!,"There are several pillows out there on the market, but I believe the Boppy is the most versatile. It is not just for nursing! The stores all sell these for quite a bit of money; Amazon comes through again with a great deal. I use this all the time with my son for several things and I am very glad I had it when I went to the hospital to deliver him! It made those first few frustrating nursing attempts much better than just shoving pillows underneath your arms. I highly recommend."
2,Not firm,"I ordered the boppy pillow for my 8 month old son, when I received it it was not firm especially in the middle of the pillow. Not really satisified with the quality of the boppy."
5,Could not function without it.,"The Boppy is invaluable for breastfeeding, especially when babies are small and you're worried about breaking their fragile necks if you're a paranoid first-time mom. It works well for bottle feeding too if that's how you roll.Additionally, this is one of the only ways my baby would nap. If you place a receiving blanket over/around the Boppy and tuck it in, it creates a taut hammock that my baby loved. I put it in his Pack n Play like this and since he has reflux/congestion it was much better for his sleeping patterns. The tag says not to let babies sleep in the Boppy - just use common sense and supervise your baby. This is perfect for newborn naps with the receiving blanket acting as a hammock."
5,a lifesaver for learning how to breastfeed,I recieved a boppy at my shower used from a friend. In these first weeks I'd say it is my most used item. In the hospital I struggled to get my baby propped up on pillows as well as my arms comfortable while breastfeeding. When I got home I was so relieved to have the boppy and instantly things were much easier. I heard the more expensive nursing pillows are better but I am quite satisfied with my boppy. My baby also doesn't like to be put down so I let himap on it on my lap when he is done nursing. I use it to hold him more comfortably on the couch when we are just lounging around too. I did buy 2 covers which is really helpful because it gets all kinds of spit up on etc.
3,Sandy,"I, too, thought this nursing pillow was wonderful. However, as I started reading more and more about the benefits of breastfeeding, I realized that I was not making eye contact with my baby while using this pillow. I have been doing this for two months now but I will stop using it. BTW-I am signed in on my husband's account."
3,Overrated IMO,"I bought one of these when I had my baby. I don't nurse, but I thought it would be helpful for feeding him after my planned c-section. He's almost 6 months old now, and I never have really used it around my waist for feedings. I do use it under my elbow, but I could have done that with any pillow and it wouldn't have cost $25! It would even be more worth it if the covers didn't cost another $10! Maybe they're more useful to nursing moms."
3,Am I crazy for thinking this is overrated?!,"I was thrilled to receive this at my baby shower but when the baby arrived and it was time to start using it, I was a bit let-down. I am tall and had to hunch over to nurse- after a short while this became extremely hard on my back. I had a C-section with my daughter and this pillow put more strain on my back and abdomen than I could take. My husband and I still use it, but we have to stuff pillows underneath it to prop up the sides. Also, the cover I wanted cost the same as the pillow- 25.00! I hate when companies exploit their customers by charging ridiculous sums of money for pretty basic goods. I know by now though that people- including my self- will spend any amount of money on anything having to do with babies."
2,Overrated and saggy after short use,"The miracle middle is nothing special, so if you are a plus size mom on the larger side of plus, don't buy this thinking the pillow will stretch and wrap around you. I'm very short and this pillow was in a awkward position while breastfeeding, and wasn't long enough to offer the ever important elbow support. This applies when using the bottle with a heavier baby as well.The pillow is painfully missing back support, and the middle dips and sags. I only used this pillow for 3-4 months before using one of my regular pillows with a waterproof pad under because it was cumbersome and already losing shape.Use of this as a baby support is okay, better than a regular pillow, though in a pinch rolled up blankets work fine. While having the ability to customize your pillow style is nice, the added expense for an average product almost negates the pros.The pillow is said to be machine washable, but given the poor quality of the stuffing inside, do so at your own risk!"
2,can't recommend,"as nice as this item looks and feels: as a nursing pillow i found it useless. our baby rolled off it and i could never find a comfortable position for both of us. i got a brest friend from craigslist, and though it is really ugly, it's just fabulous for nursing."
3,"great baby ""sitter"" - meh nursing pillow","This pillow worked great when my daughter was starting to sit around 5 months. I could set her in this and not worry too much about her bonking her head when she tipped over. It was also great for a baby lounger for a couple months before that. As far as nursing goes, it wasn't any more useful than a normal pillow. It is too soft and flat to provide much support, and since I'm on the plus size side, it never sat right around my waist either."
3,"Didn't like for breastfeeding, loved for recovery","I bought this as I was told it was must for breastfeeding moms. I actually hated using it while breastfeeding. I found it super uncomfortable and unnatural. The concept is on the mark, but each individual would need a boppy tailored for their body build (width, length, etc) and their baby's needs. As far as I'm concerned, it's a waste for breastfeeding.I'd give it a lower review, if it weren't for the comfort it afforded me while I was recovering from a rather large tear during labor. As I left the hospital the nurse told me to sit on a lot of pillows for the next couple of weeks. She told me a donut cushion would work best (so I put this to use). I'm shocked that I needed a comfy couch (really my couch is very soft), a folded blanket, a pillow, and this boppy (in that order) all under my derriere for about two weeks before I could sit without horrid pain.Yup, that was this things best use."
1,Not a Breastfeeding Pillow,"I'll say that the Boppy is great for tummy time, as a little prop-up pillow for babies who can't sit yet, and other similar uses. It is NOT a good breastfeeding pillow. Unless you luck and and have just the perfect shortness in your torso, this pillow will do little to prop up your baby to the right height without you also having to use your arms, other pillows, etc. And when you are nursing an infant all the time, your arms get tired. The boppy is useless! I saw a number of lactation consultants when my daughter was born and all of them said the same thing. They all recommended a pillow that gets your baby up to the right height and allows you to be ""hands free."" Check out the BrestFriend-- it was the key to our nursing success after I gave up on the Boppy."
3,Not good for babies who spit up a lot,"This pillow, which I discovered the hard way, can make feeding issues like acid reflux and spitting up way worse than need be; I found when I ditched the pillow and used regular pillows propped at angles the issues eased up. I saw somewhere (too late) there is a wedge to address this issue -- perhaps they could bundle together for stages of feeding? But, it made a good back-rest."
2,Ripped off ... at the seams.,"I purchased this pillow because I planned to breastfeed, and it worked well for that purpose at first. It also was good for propping my baby up whenever he was awake, but the reason I gave it only 2 stars is because of its poor craftmanship. At a cost of more than $20, it should be better made and last longer than 6-to-8 weeks. By the time my infant was 3 months old, the pillow was falling apart at the seams in at least two places. Stuffing was coming out where the stitching had come undone, forcing me to have to repair it myself."
3,"Not great for nursing, but works well for tummy time","I did not care for this pillow when used as a nursing pillow, the pillow went all the way around my waist, making it impossible to sit back in the chair, causing back strain. Having to lean forward to nurse was not comfortable. This pillow is great for tummy time, I put my son in the pillow with his arms over the middle, the ends were under or over his legs and then I put toys in front of him to keep him entertained, at first he just looked at them, but as time went on he would reach for the toys. I had a Boppy when my daughter was little also, she used the pillow as a toddler to read and such. This is not a must have item."
4,Good pillow,"I'm really happy I have this pillow. It is useful in other positions, such as the clutch position. The only problem I had was when my daughter was small she fell into the crack between my stomach and the pillow. It can be solved by rolling up a recieving blanket and putting it in that crack. Otherwise, I have been really happy I had this pillow."
3,Need a firmer pillow,"I have two boppy's -- a new one purchased for this baby and an older dual use one (from an earlier version of the EntertainMe(tm) Play Gym) and the older one is much firmer and better for nursing. I was hot during pregnancy, and hot during nursing, so sinking into the new boppy is just too much insulation! Also, I need the pillow to raise the baby off my lap so I'm not straining, and I found the new squishy boppy didn't do the trick. I'm now only using the older firmer one.I haven't found the ""stretch middle"" to be all that necessary (despite having outgrown my XL maternity clothes during this pregnancy!) but I do like having covers so I can wash them when the bodily fluids get too much."
4,more versatile than most nursing pillows,"this isn't my favorite pillow for nursing (that's My Brest Friend, even given its awful name). BUT I really have liked this pillow for its versatility. It works ok for nursing (my biggest complaint: it slides out away from my body, and baby falls in crack).It also is good for playing with baby-- propping baby in different positions, depending on his development."
1,Not good for breastfeeding,"I don't understand how this pillow got a reputation for being a breastfeeding pillow. It works great as an infant support pillow but I'm not sure I would have registered for it just for that. As many others have said, baby slips down between you and the pillow. Also, I'm a short person but I still have to hunch down to keep a latch. I struggled with breastfeeding initially and because I thought this pillow was supposed to be some sort of miracle breastfeeding aid, I kept using it and continued to struggle. Now I'm using regular pillows from the bed while I try to decide if I can justify the cost of a My Brest Friend. By the by, I had mentioned my Boppy issues to my lactation consultant and she said she hears complaints about it all the time. If you are crafty, she mentioned that you can buy a piece of foam at the craft store, cut it to curve a bit around your belly, and cover it in fabric and get much better results than with the Boppy."
4,"Great, but not so much for nursing...","I really wish I loved this thing as much as most of the other reviewers! I just remember feeling like maybe I was using it wrong because everyone else LOVES it. We're getting ready for baby 2 and our boppy is in pristine condition...I'll pull it out again and attempt to nurse with it, but for me using this while trying to nurse was awkward and frustrating! I'm average height but had to still hunch over to feed my baby if he rested on this or otherwise I had to hold the pillow up higher for him to reach...if it was about 6 inches thicker it would be great! Ha! It was super great for when my son was learning to sit up though! we had hard wood floors so I would sit him in this and if he toppled back he was still nice & safe:) We got a good month of use out of it before he became fairly stable...So I guess IMO it's a bit overrated, but I don't know anyone who agrees with me-so I'd say get it & see what you think!Good luck!"
5,Pleasantly surprised,"My boyfriend told me this pillow was a necessity, I didn't think it was but he said he wanted it for when he was feeding the baby so we got one. At first I thought it was in the way because of the way I held the baby but when I realized I could use it to hold the baby so that I could use both of my hands I have fallen in love with it. It is a first time mom life saver."
1,Made for an uncomfortable nursing experience,"I had purchased this product prior to the birth of my baby with much excitement. I could not wait to use it! After it's first use though, I was highly disappointed. Not only did it not fit around my waist/belly ...but it was not nearly thick enough to support my baby to the level of nipple. My arms were tired and sore as well as my back. I had to stuff extra pillows underneath in order to make it work. I ended up no longer using the Boppy after only a few feedings and just stuck with using regular 'ol pillows. I did however use the Boppy to help prop my baby in upright positions. I hardly think it's worth the price. A bit of a waste if you ask me."
1,Not good for breastfeeding,"Like many women, I bought this thinking it was for breastfeeding. It is not. It was originally made to support babies in the sitting -up position. If you are looking for a pillow for breastfeeding, buy the My BreastFriend. Don't waste your money like I did on two different pillows."
2,What a BUMMER!,"I was looking forward to using this product when I nursed my baby boy. It didn't work for me at all! It kept sliding forward and he would end up wedged between me and it, down on my lap. My husband bought me a ""My Brest Friend Deluxe"" on Mother's Day. It is THE BEST! It may be because I am on the smaller side but I could not keep the @#$%^ boppy against me. Yes I have the newer model with the Wonder flex middle or whatever they claim. The only use was my baby could kind of sit in it when he was newborn. I have a friend whose husband uses it for a neck pillow so I guess it has a second life."
2,Doesn't support,"Waste of money. My back is killing me! This pillow isn't thick enough to support baby at nipple height, I find myself slouching/twisting/bending to get my breast to her. As a result, I feel miserable. I'm only 5'2, I can't imagine this would work for a tall person. I'm also thin, size 6... The pillow wraps around me and hits the chair back behind me, leaving a huge gap between my waist and the pillow, leaving baby unsupported too. I have tried bending, folding, turning, etc the pillow to work-it just doesn't. I would try the breast friend pillow instead, if I get a hold of one cheap, I'll update this review to compare the pillows?Update:Brest friend pillow is much more supportive. It belts around you and provides better support for baby. My back feels much better!"
4,Works great!,"I'm really glad I got this! It is nice for feeding but works great for just holding baby in a better position. I read a review knocking it for not being waterproof or having waterproof covers to keep liquids off of it. After my own use, yes that would be nice but the pillow washes great! I just tossed it in the washer on delicate with the baby clothes, dried it in the dryer and it was good as new! My only complaint is that the ends are already (after10 weeks) starting to compress."
2,it's ok,got this as a shower gift... had i known i would have registered for my brest friend... used one at the lactation consultant office and was very impressed. the boppy is lumpy and after two months is rapidly losing firmness in its middle.
3,Just ok for me,"I had a boppy for my first and second child and each time I got a new one and each time they ended up flattening out quite rapidly. I agree with another that said the covers are nothing but aesthetic as they do not prevent stains and smells from seeping through.Other options?For this baby I chose the Blessed Nest nursing pillow. [...]Sure it's a little more pricey, but you're getting organic buckwheat hulls fill and organic cotton covering, which is really sturdy. You still have somewhat of the leak-through, but much less because the cover is textured and even when there is, the buckwheat hulls dry out quickly and don't retain smells. I love that it conforms to your body too. I've used it during my pregnancy and it's wonderful."
1,"this thing is evil get the ""breast friend""","I am not exaggerating I really thought this thing was evil. This thing lays in on your knees, whose breast reach to their knees?! I had to bend over and this thing was slipping and sliding all over the place and with a wobbly newborn, c-section, and hormonal changes I wanted to torch this thing. Thankfully, a friend told me about ""breast friend"" (not the best name) and that nursing pillow saved the nursing experience for us, you can strap it around yourself so you can have it higher and it stays in place, it's also much better quality so it doesn't fold on itself and therefore more comfortable for the baby as well. It's a bit more money but absolutely worth it.Since we took off the tags of the boppy and washed the covers, we kept and my husband used it for bottle feedings but to us it was not worth the money for what we ended up using it for. I also have friends who did not have a c-section who also regretted buying it. I don't see the hype, I really don't."
2,Too Soft,In London I use the Widgey pillow and so I thought this was similar. I went to visit my parents in the US and sent one of these to their house. It's not the same. It's too soft in the middle and my baby boy was struggling while nursing. It's not as solid and a great disappointment. My London pillow is amazing!
2,not all that great,"maybe it's because i'm 5'11 and it's meant for a smaller frame but this pillow was never very comfortable and i never use it..well, actually i use it as a pillow for my neck every now and then but that's it. waste of money for me, works for a lot of other people i know though."
3,Just OK ... definitely not awesome,"I registered for a Boppy when I was pregnant with my first son ... but I was quite disappointed when it actually came time to use it. It just didn't feel wide enough or supportive enough for my taste, and as a tall person (I'm 5'10""), it just didn't get my baby close enough to me to make it completely comfortable to nurse.In addition, the covers aren't waterproof, and as any nursing mom knows, you WILL leak ... or your kid will drool or spit up milk all over! After I washed my Boppy (according to the manufacturer's instructions), it was never the same ... it felt lumpy.That was pretty much the end of the Boppy -- it's sitting in a closet somewhere. For my next baby, I'm going to try the My Brest Friend and see if that's an improvement."
2,Not recommended for breastfeeding,"I got the boppy for helping hold up the baby during breastfeeding. If you want a product for this purpose, I'd recommend trying a different one -- perhaps the breast friend? Because the edge of the boppy curves down, the baby falls into that crack / lower spot. It's just awkward. Also, it's better to have the baby's head higher than their tummy to avoid acid reflux (trust me -- you'll care about acid reflux :)), and so you'd have to somehow tip the boppy, which I never figured out how to do. I ended up not using it at all and just using a little square pillow under my arm that was holding her head, and no pillow under her bum."
1,Not a Breastfeeding Pillow,"The Boppy was never designed or intended to be used as a breastfeeding pillow. While it may have some good uses, if you need a pillow for breastfeeding support, try the My Brest Friend Pillow. The My Brest friend is better for your back, more firm & holds the baby higher to make latching easier. I work in a lactation center & the My Brest Friend is all we use."
1,Not a good nursing pillow,"As a nursing pillow, I found the Boppy to be really challenging (I nursed my son for 18 months). I always had to use 3 extra pillows to get my son at the proper height and avoid being hunched over, and I'm not a tall person (5'5"" and 120lbs). When my son was 13 months old I tried a My Brest Friend nursing pillow and was blown away- it puts the Boppy to shame. The Boppy is great for tummy time and for when you little one is learning how to sit on his or her own, but that's about it."
2,Not for Breasfeeding,"I couldn't use this pillow to breastfeed. Maybe it is because my daughter is too small (10%) or I am too small (115lbs, 5'5) but it kept moving away from me and my daughter sliding between the pillow and me. It was a total waste on that side. I ended up borrowing a My Best Friend pillow which worked great.I did use the Boppy to support her while playing and sitting up. I recommend it for that."
3,It's helpful,"For the most part the boppy has been pretty helpful. It's really great for breastfeeding, it helps me support my son so my arms don't get tired and so I don't have to bend down quite as far to feed him. He fits well on it and I can still position him in different ways. The only thing I'm really disappointed with is that within 4 weeks of using it the seem has already come unsown about 4 inches at least it's at a place I can easily hand sow it together but it's really annoying that I have to do that, it should hold up a lot longer than 4 weeks. I haven't fixed it yet only because I have a cover that keeps it contained while it's on, but I'll have to sow it up soon so it stays together longer. I hope it doesn't fall apart anymore."
2,"Not needed, expensive","I had a C-Section and thought this would help. I preferred the stability of my other nursing pillow (my breastfriend). However, before you decide on that pillow: I had a C-Section and it requires the Mom to lean forward or otherwise move a back-support cushion behind her, which is far from comfortable.For the next child, I will skip both as a waste of money. A normal pillow--or better yet a chair with arms--is more than enough support. A nursing pillow definitely should not be a high-expense item."
3,must have item --not so must have,"I was told I absolutely had to have a Boppy..I breastfeed and it does not provide enough support..I would recomend my BreastFriend(same price)for breastfeeding purposes. However, this was great to use for tummy time to prop my child up when he was super tiny..and also a great support for helping him to sit up..much better than a Bumpo seat which really limited his reach and activity.."
3,"Not so great for nursing, But good for baby.","The ""miracle middle"" boppy didn't work for nursing my son. I am average sized with a very large infant, and it just slid out from underneath him when I used it for breastfeeding. It would work much better with an adjustable strap to hold it in place, like the ""my breast friend"" pillow. I gave it three stars though because we use it often as an infant seat. My son can recline in it, and it has been great for tummy time. But go to the store and buy one with a slipcover already on it. I got one at Target with a slipcover & a year long magazine subscription for about the same price as a bare naked boppy."
3,Different than the movie,"I wish that I had read a few before buying so many of them. It's much different than the original movie. Still, it has potential to be good."
3,Hey what happened to earlier reviews?,"What happened to all the earlier reviews of this book? There were a few. I know I wrote one; this is one of the books that had just atrocious scan errors. Whole paragraphs missing. Perhaps it has been rescanned and put back up on the site? If so, how come those of us who bought it earlier are not getting the better, corrected version?"
5,Perfect cover,I love this foundation it really covers without being too thick... The seller was fast to ship it and I couldn't be happier about this product... I will never buy a different foundation
5,Just Great!,One of my favorites! Great makeup product. Revlon rocks! Cheap and great quality! A+! I will use this for the rest of my life.
3,Interesting retrospective,"Made in USA in 1999, Serial# 72435-20581-2-9, Playing Time 35:18This CD is part of EMI's ""10 Best Series"", which consists of putting what the record company deems to be the 10 best tracks from the artist.This compilation features tracks up to their 3rd album, ""Round Trip"", plus 1 song (Don't Look Back) left in the vaults until the ""Retrospective"" album issued back in 1992.THE KNACK, mostly known for ""My Sharona"", make basic but catchy music; I'd call it ""Fun Rock"": straight ahead, unpretentious melodies, that make you want to ""get up and dance"". The sad part is that the CD only lasts 35 minutes, their writing style consisting of 3-minute songs.If you've got other retrospectives, you'll probably pass up on this; but if you don't, it's a good place to get exposed to their songwriting skills."
5,Get all the Knack you want!,"A very good compilation of a band that could have done much more in the history of rock. Unfortunately, they disbanded, but the outcome left by far deserves an opportunity."
5,Good Kenny Rogers movie,Glad that I got this movie. Saw the movie when it was on TV and it was good then. Good message.
3,Decent movie.,I enjoyed the subject matter of this movie. It brought back memories. I'd still recommend it though it seems to be edited differently than original.
3,ok,"This is a ok movie, worth watching once but thats really about it. The acting is not that great and the stage area and fight scenes are really a complete joke, looks like something out of the 50's, But for the price I guess I can not complain."
4,enjoyable,lets you know what it was like during WWII and how far a respectful man can be pushed before it comes to a boil and justice is given to the ones that deserve it.
3,needs a better finishing,I found Coward of the County a bit slow characters were played well however it left the story open at the end Overall an slow but Okay film I love Kenny Rogers acting and singing too bad he did not choose to carry on with a better closing
4,works as advertised,"Updated firmware per instructions -- works with both my e280s, one with Rockbox, the other with updated Sansa firmware. Just needed something for my desk, and this works just fine without using up too much space."
1,This product was a JOKE!,"DO NOT PURCHASE THIS ITEM!!!! I had done what I thought was adequate homework on this product before purchase to ensure it was compatible with the Sansa MP3 as it is advertised. However, as soon as the MP3 player was connected it completely fried the player - to the point that all songs that had been previously downloaded, etc. were lost - as well as the MP3 player itself."
1,Defective,Product was defective. Returned to Amazon and they were very helpful in crediting my account.
2,Didn't work and no real instructions.,"The docking station would charge the Sansa just like it said, however I could not get it to play music through the speakers. It came with one sheet of instructions and I followed them but could not get it to do anything other than charge the mp3 player. I called the company and no one could explain to me how to get the speakers to actually to work. I sent them back and bought an IPOD with another set of speakers that worked with no problems."
2,"Looks nice, doesn't sound nice though","I bought this product after reading some of the reviews here that said it put out sufficent sound despite its small size. After setting it up and trying it out I was less than impressed. The sound is sunstandard and has very little bass. There are also lots of wires that run from each section which can be difficult to hide.It does charge nicely and the blue light looks good but if you need speakers for your sansa, look for something else!I ended up using a set of old computer speakers that plug into the headphone slot. It may not charge it but I can hear what I want quite clearly and with sufficent bass."
4,Could be better but not bad for basic use,So the deal here with this unit is that it works perfectly for a small room like a bedroom or a dorm room. Use it for anything bigger and you will be disappointed. Expect it to sound like a home theater system and you will be sadly mistaken. 40 bucks. It is what it is and it works well. The problem is that when you buy the Sansa products (great stuff) the options for accessories is limited.
2,Weak Speakers,"The speakers are cheap and weak. It looks ok and is functional, but the sound quality just isn't there."
5,You need to update firmware.,"Regarding the people below that don't get any sound when docking the player. Updating the firmware on your Sansa will fix this. I have had the same issue with other ""made for Sansa"" products."
3,Good Program For Cheap,"This program is a blast. I had no definitive project in mind when i bought it, but I've I spent so much time goofin' with it my wife is getting jealous."
2,Disappoining. Watery and hard to rinse off.,"I really wanted to like this, but found it to be surprisingly watery. It is also very hard to rinse off after shaving. Other than that, it works pretty well, but I'm not going to buy it again."
2,Overpriced and doesn't work that well,"For my skin and beard type I guess, I have a rougher beard and I shave about everyday. I've used this about 3x now and it doesn't work well at all and I even used it with the pre-shave oil, just terrible. I went back to my gel, but the rest of the Anthony line is great."
2,Not great at all,"Other reviews stated shaving with this would be a smooth experience. It wasn't even close for me. I'm not 100% sure how much of the shaving cream I'm supposed to pile on my face but it didn't matter because it was still very difficult to shave. My facial hair isn't very thick. I didn't have a full on beard when I tried shaving either (due to the fact I can't grow one).I barely had less than an inch of stubble, and it was not an enjoyable experience shaving with this cream. It felt like my razor was getting caught on every hair. Am I supposed to only using a single blade? My Gilette one has three. Hopefully that is not what is causing the issue.I would not recommend this product."
1,Low Quality,I just opened up the bottle and a ton of water poured out it was like the seller cut I with water. Also the bottle was not as pictured.I have purchased this in the past and loved it but due to his incident I am questions future purchases because it is so expensive.
3,"Eh, its ok but overpriced","I usually like Anthony products, but the shaving cream isn't really worth the price.If you are like me and have sensitive skin, you are better off trying another brand. I've actually found that Gillette or Colgate from the pharmacy works better."
4,Great Table Book,"If you live in or near Rio Linda,know someone who does or has, or even want to send a gift to Rush Limbaugh, this is a nice general history of the town. It's fun to know that the local auto body shop building used to be the poultry exchange and that Rio Linda was once the poultry capitol of California. No wonder there are still lots of chickens around town. I leave this out on the coffee table and it is a good conversation piece."
5,Pure Mountain Magic,"I thoroughly enjoyed this book. I finished it 2 nights ago, yet it haunts me still. The author has captured the feel and heart of the area she writes about. I had the privilege of meeting and talking with Vicki Lane a few weeks ago, and found her work to be as refreshing and likeable as the lady herself. The reader can truly feel the kindredship the author has with the Applachian Mountains and the good folks who inhabit them. I am a brand new fan of Elizabeth Goodweather and the writer who created her."
4,Good read,"I decided to start this series, I have recently moved to this area, and I thought it may be fun to read about my new home. It was!I liked the characters very much, and the author is great at describing the people and the feel of the area. Also the author is right on describing the beauty of this wonderful part of America.I gave it a four rather than a five only because I felt the end was rushed, the stories that I were wading through trying to figure out the mystery, just kind of fell into place a little to neatly and a little to quick. However, I look forward to reading her other books, I really did enjoy this one enough to push me to read her others. If you are looking for a good mystery, with a different setting, this is for you. Again, she really does give the read a feel for this area."
2,Strike one...,"Having read _The Shadow Within_ and _To Dream in the City of Sorrows_ (B5 novels 7 and 9) I began to wonder about the earlier novels. I had heard they were not as good, but I wanted to see for myself. Yup. _Voices_ is an uncomfortable read that depends too heavily on the episodes which it draws from (mostly Mind War, Deathwalker, Grail and Eyes). Duece and Harriman Gray show up (it seems) simply to tie into the series; they could have easily been two new and interesting characters. Kosh is reduced to a walking fortune-cookie dispenser.On the other hand, there are a few interesting concepts that sadly were never brought up on the show. This makes the novel doubly frustrating.I ended up with the sense that the author was so concerned with remaining canon that when he failed in that respect, he had sacrificed too much of his plot for the story to survive. I will give him another chance with Blood Oath...."
2,Shame about the sexism,"A weird one, this one. Aspects of the book are quite good, such as some of the characterisation ofthe male characters - Garibaldi, Grey and Bester the short guy. The writing is juvenile and someof the sexism is unacceptable. Every time Ivanova or Talia are mentioned, the author has to say that theyare 'beautiful' or 'glamourous' or 'aluring'. Never once is Garibaldi described as 'hunky'. Andyes I know there is a reason for that, but still... Unforgivable is Talia squealling with delightat one point - I mean, REALLY."
1,NOT for die hard Babylon 5 fans..,"I have to disagree with the genral consensus that this is for the loyal fans of B5.. in fact, those loyal fans are the people this book is going to annoy. One could be forgiven for thinking Mr Vornholt had never seen an episode of the programme in his life, he had so little grasp on the charctors. Which is a pity, because the ides in the book were actually very good. I just could not stop thinking ""this character would NOT have said/done that.. at least not that way"". He also used too many adjectives - there are only so many times we need to hear how beautiful Talia is, or how Kosh speaks... So, if you have never seen Babylon 5, or only a few epidoes, you might enjoy this book. Otherwise, stay away and read number 2, it is leaps and bounds above this one."
3,Not Free SF Reader,"The first of what was supposed to only be a handful of Babylon 5 books.That, of course, fell by the wayside as soon as they made enough money out of 'em, it would seem. The good thing about these books is thatthey could go to places and show things that the budget of the television show could not cater for, such as more time set on other planets, for example."
3,Mainly a Talia Winters - Michael Garibaldi novel.,"Readable, although had a couple of physics errors, like needing to 'get back to speed' after cutting off the acceleration on a shuttle (no acceleration equals no perceived gravity was right, though). Some of the people made some decisions that seemed non-typical for them. One such thing was the conference on Babylon 5, although when you accepted that, the rest was quite believable.Mainly a Talia Winters - Michael Garibaldi novel.The events take place after ""Points of Departure"" and before ""A Race Through Dark Places""."
5,probaly the best book for this tv show,"a telepath convention is being held on babylon 5. when an explosion happens, all the evidence points toward talia winters.she manages to escape and her trial and errors on clearing hername without getting caught make this a very intersting book.while most people that watched babylon 5 probaly did not pay muchattention to talia's character this book brings it out and all b5 fans should definitely read it."
2,Definetly not the last best hope for a good read,"This book was not quite as good as i had hoped. there were many things i was unhappy about, but also some very good concepts. I liked Harriman Grey being in the story but the author did not really get Talia Winters right. In his defense he had book 1. His was the first and with mr Bester he had been in only one show. If you are a B5 fan get it and give it a read. it is still good for a collection."
2,The '60s Hits,Pretty disappointing. Even though the artists were shown as the original only a small number of the songs were actually performed by the original artists. The way this CD was presented for sale was very misleading.
2,Sound quality not good,"Some of the songs do not sound like the original artists renditions. The remaster/remix is not good, especially with the advancement of technology. Not worth the money."
2,fraud,"A lot of these are not the original artist. That's why they're re-recorded, i.e., by different people. This is a misrepresentation and what makes on-line sales risky. Hope you didn't get hood-winked! Nothing like the real thing, baby!"
3,Unprofessional,"I was a bit dissatisfied initially and still now, after having played and walked to the music in Shape Fitness Music - Walk 1 60's. First, the audio quality is generally poor (not up to the level of the original recordings at all). Second, the individual songs are regularly cut short at the end, which annoys me because it's disruptive to my pace. Also, not all the songs are synchronized to the same beat, so if you play the music in random order, you have a problem of slower rhythms following faster rhythms. I will not purchase another Shape Fitness Music product because of this experience. The product is far too costly for the quality level anyway!"
1,I still have not received this item,"I still have not received this item, please ask to be checked which may have occurred. I look forward to a return as soon as possible."
3,Little Top Heavy,"The overall look of the cabinet is very nice. However, it's top heavy and falls forward when you open the doors. It also doesn't have slots on the inside to insert your CDs. They fall over if the shelf is not completely full."
5,Love it!,"I actually bought two of these shower curtains and made one of them into a window covering using a double rod with the top of the curtain for a valance and the rest of the curtain made into two short window curtains with tiebacks. It completes the look in my re-decorated bathroom, and I love it....."
3,It's Dino,"This was purchased as a gift for my husband,who loves Dean Martin.He just got it for his birthday & hasn't listened to it yet. But, he says he is sure he will like it."
2,Cheap,"I am very disappointed. We put a brand new battery in the wind meter, and it still does not work. Cheap kit, not many activities for my child to do. Not at all what I was expecting. Wont buy again."
5,Friends,This was an international transaction and I was happy with the CD - it was as described. I would buy from them again. Thanks.
2,disapointing,"I was quite disappointed with this book. I came from the ""Feynman lectures on computation"", a really enlightening book that answers fundamental questions.Do not look for the same kind of book in the ""Feynman and computation"" it is a quite old and non-fundamental view of the subjects."
2,short ryders,"something happened between the last long ryders cd and the solo sid griffin ""little victories"" and ""as certain as sunrise"" cd. I felt it was outdated and sounded like something from the late 50's. maybe sid isn't one of the long ryders after all. sorry , but get back to the gene clark sound."
4,RAM,"Only thing missing is sufficient memory to run Vista properly.Also Vista is quite cumbersome, and doesn't do all the things XP did to make life easier. Plug n play is very confusing and lacks the ease of use that XP had. Like my printer works but the rest of its features I just haven't had the time to set up, scan,copy,fax."
4,SR5010NX Vista,Compouter works well for nice price. Has some ajustments needed to network with older XP systemed computers.
2,Not a very good model,"It's quiet, looks nice, battery indicator is a plus, but for $60+ dollars, this is a pretty weak shaver. The motor is just not strong enough, and it requires going over the same area a few times for a clean shave (which can cause some razor burns). If you have a lot of facial hair, don't get this model. I've purchased Philips/Norelco shavers ever since I had to shave, one every few years, and they're just getting weaker and weaker. I think it's time to switch to a Panasonic; pricey but worth the money for something that needs to be used all the time."
5,Excellent shave!,I have owned 2 Norelcos over the last 20 years (yes they last that long) and when my last one got tired I decided to replace it with a Remington Titanium 9170. Huge mistake! I returned it after 2 shaves and bought this razor and was hooked during the first use of it. The pivoting heads easily and snugly fit the contours of your face and it gave an excellent first shave that will only get better as the blades break in over the next few weeks. The color is a bit odd and it seemed to take the hand of god to get the trimmer open but those are my only complaints.Rotary razors don't work for every type of beard but they work well for me and this is the best I have ever owned. Norelco forever!
4,close and quick shave,"I've owned a few Norelcos. They are sturdy and dependable. I tried Braun that shaves closer. However, Norelco shaves nearly as close (the difference is minimal) and lasts much longer. The 6863XL is good but its cracking noises in a brand new shaver are disturbing. Makes me wonder if it's as sturdy as its older uncles."
2,"Gordon Park's ""Black Boy""","Anyone else read Black Boy? It's quite obvious that Gordon Parks did, seeing as how he even stoops to taking plot points from the much better book by Richard Wright. Read Black Boy instead, it is much more insightful, well written and powerful, still dealing with the same issues."
1,Terrible ;),"this was about the worst and slowest-paced book i've ever read. In english class we had to read a book by a black author and my teacher thought i might like it. but i didn't. it was terrible. by the time you get about halfway through the pace picks up, but by then it's pointless. don't buy this book or read it. please."
3,Nice Coming Of Age Story,"Often when a movie is made that is based upon a book, the book is usually better; however, I can't say the same here. As I read this, I found myself thinking more about the movie and how much better the movie scenes were. In any event, this was a pretty good read. It started out rather slowly for me, but picked up about mid-way and I was able zoom through to the end. The book brings forth additional members of Newton's family and touches on other aspects of life that were not a part of the movie (Newt's friendship with Rodney, Newt's cousin who could pass for white). I am hoping for and patiently waiting on the DVD."
3,Clinical Companion,"I keeping it because it cost $1 plus shipping. The info is helpful & evidence-based. I didn't offer anything not avail with mobile apps, but helpful for slow internet connection"
3,somewhat incomplete,"found it difficult to use. Dx such as pluracy, cholesistitis, were no where to be found. Much repetative information from one chapter to the next."
4,"This is Good, Not Great","Having used Kal, Red Star, and then this brand, I must say that these have a less desirable flavor than the before mentioned brands. They smell different and taste slightly different. I will probably go back to the Kal brand."
3,"Work Ok, but Sticky Closure can easily peel open...","It's light and in-expensive compared to the same size bubble mailers. I use this to send stuff that can't be easily broken like items of clothing. Only problem is the sticky closure. My usual poly bags from other sellers will rip the packaging if you pull on the sticky closure in an attempt to re-open. This one will just peel right open. Because of that, I'm reinforcing the closure with packaging tape. Serves its purpose, but probably won't buy again."
2,Problems,These are of great quality except that mailing labels will sometimes come off. I was planning on using these for my business until this discovery was made.
5,Perfect mailers.,"I see a lot of negative reviews on these. Maybe it's because they're a generic product?These are standard poly mailers, 6x9. You can fit a DVD-sized case easily, fit a CD if you fold it once, mail smaller books, etc. They are quite durable, and I've mailed at least 100 orders with no problems. The adhesive is good, and I've never needed to reinforce it. I haven't seen any problems or inconsistencies. They are solid, not transparent. You can also double-bag them if you're feeling unsure.As for mailing labels not sticking? I've never had that problem. I would blame that on your mailing label's adhesive, but this material is literally made for mailing labels to work perfectly on. Now, it's possible to unpeel the label if you really tried, just like on a box or paper material, but you won't rip the mailer.Bottom line is: they're extremely affordable and perfect for mailing. No problems. You can even use them for your own stuff. Buy them if you need 200."
1,These are just plain horrible,"I usually order my poly bags from Uline but thought I would save some money and order these. Well, I got what I paid for. The flaps on the bag are uneven. The glue strip is tiny (but does actually stick). The bags rip down the side seam. They are flimsy and not actually white as the silver lining shows through. I will not be able to use them as I feel the bags will rip before they reach the customer."
2,These bags stick together,"Ive used many bags similar to these, but these bags stick together making it a real pain to put things inside of them. I need to find my old bags."
2,very difficult to pry open,"These poly mailers are extremely thin, and they are difficult to pry open. I have ordered many poly mailers in the past 3 years, and these are the poorest quality I have ever seen. I chose this seller because of the Amazon Prime account, but I have had better luck with valumailers in the past."
4,"Inexpensive, tough, seals well. Not white, however.","Overall, I am happy with the product. At about a nickel per bag for a durable mailer, this product is perfect for sending out items that can take being tossed and crushed during shipping.The bags that I received were black on the inside, and greyish on the outside. Definitely not paper white. The flap closures sealed well. As a previous reviewer has already noted, the bags were stuck closed. I've found that it was easier to open the bag by blowing into the bag than to try to pry the clinging sides either by inserting my hand or a tool into the bag.The only other annoyance is that the bags come somewhat wrinkled. However, consider how they will be used in shipping, this really isn't a problem in my case."
2,Really AWFUL when packing in bulk,"I have ordered tens of thousands of these polymailers, and these, by far, are the worst. They are stuck closed, almost like static, so you have to stick your hand inside each one to pry it open before you can put anything inside. NOT conducive when you have 100's of orders you are packing at once. I can't wait to get through these so I can never order them again!"
5,Awesome product!,The Envelopes are of high quality; just as expected! Self sticking seals makes these envelopes easy to use and you know your item inside is secure.
2,Need to be improved,"These are not exactly white....which doesn't matter to me, except I would like that in the description so I don't buy them again. The seal is NOT strong and these can open during transit....so I have to take the time to tape each envelope"
1,Not very happy,I have ordered 6x9 poly mailers on amazon several times in the past. These are by far the THINNEST I have received! So thin you can see right through them when held up to the light. In the past I ordered in smaller quantities and they have been great. This time I opted for 200 because I was satisfied with the others. Big mistake! Obviously all poly mailers are not created equal!! I just got them tonight so I haven't used them yet. I'm afraid to as I am not sure they will hold up in the mail.
3,Good intro reference book for kids.,"Great information, but would like to find a good reference book like this that does not include evolution as the primary theory of why things are like they are."
5,LOOKING FOR IT FOR A LONG TIME,"I looked for this CD everywhere but couldn't find it as it long gone out of production. Finally, found it on Amazon. The production date says '1999'. A very RARE CD indeed. As always, Biddu's music is amazing, powerful and different from the rest. I would say this music never seems to get old and can put many so called music producers' work to shame. Just as fresh as it was when it was released. The songs are very catchy and once you listen to this CD, you'll definitely find yourself humming the tracks while you're walking down the road. My personal favorites are 'Chhoti Si Baat' & 'Bas'.Alisha and Biddu - THE PERFECT DUO!"
1,cheap,I bought two of these rings and both time the stone fell off in the male. I ordered one more because I want the ring I just hope it arrives in one piece.
4,Super sweet!,"Ring is awesome; like a magic mood ring. One star off because the inside of the ring is quite rough; it's not really uncomfortable to wear, but is a bit scratchy."
3,Nice collection,"Nice collection of Waterboys tunes. I would have added some others and deleted some of those contained, but not a bad collectionm all in all."
5,Cardio 2 - Pure Rock DOES Rock!,"I have all of the Shape Fitness Music CDs and they are the best. This CD is great for the treadmill and keeps me motivated. I have no problems with the quality. I alternate using different workouts so I don't get tired of listening to the same stuff over and over, but this is one of my very favorites."
5,great motivation for high energy workout,wonderful tape to exercise to. I run for an hour on the treadmill listening to this tape. I never get tired of it and find it a great motivator to give my best. The songs run continuously without any pauses . Highly recommended
1,Absolutely Horrible,"I bought this CD based on the reviews, as I noticed several other people did. I was especially influenced by the person who wrote ""I love this CD""...This has to be the absolute worst collection of workout songs I've ever heard--from the pace, to the content, to the horrific effect it has on your ears. This CD did nothing to motivate me to work out. Horrible, horrible, horrible."
2,Poorly Recorded Music,"I really like the songs on this album as MUSIC but not as workout music. The recording is very poorly done and, if you can't adjust the balance and volume when this music comes on, you won't be able to hear. I tried porting over to my MP3 player where music is played in the order of title so the volume goes UP and Down and Up and Down whenever the MP3 player comes to a song from this CD _ I could not get the music ported over even with a good equalizer and line balancing. The music from the artists is original, which is nice but as I said, this is a much better cd for general listening. I read the reviews and did NOT go with the suggestions so it is my fault that this CD is not going to work as intended."
5,The Minutemen's masterpiece,"Call it 'post-punk' or 'hardcore' or 'alternative' (though none of those terms seems to capture the peculiar sound and style of this band)---in any case, this album is a brief masterpiece. Funky, punchy songs, featuring D. Boon's fractured guitar lines and agitprop lyrics. ""Bob Dylan Wrote Propaganda Songs,"" ""Sell Or Be Sold,"" and ""Life As A Rehearsal"" are standouts but there's some special touch to every song, and they follow one another like images in a nightmare you can't wake up from (I mean that in a good way.) Double Nickels On the Dime has more capaciousness and variety, but for sheer, ripping consistancy and bite the Minutemen never did better than this."
4,expose jock,"Wore these at a gay leather bar two weeks ago and got so envolved with others I lost it. They fit well, fell great, keep you hot, and almost hard, and give the people a real view of who you really are. My only commet as to being carefull is, do not get a hard-on, as it will poke through and then you are in trouble...otherwise....LEAD ON McBETH..."
5,Love This Book Very Much. It's a 'Keeper'.,I would recommend this book to anyone who is sincerely seeking for a deeper and more intimate relationship with Christ.The sender was exceptional in sending it very quickly and it was in a great shape as they had stated.
2,Don't bother with this one,"Although a story that could have been a great one, Fat Chance left me struggling to get through to the end. The characters were not believable (I wanted to reach out and slap them a couple of times) and the dialogue impossible. I thought that if I read the tag he/she winced one more time, I'd scream. If it had been a paperback it would have been a wallbanger."
3,It WARPed,"When I first got this item, I loved it. Easy to use, and get pizza's in and out of the oven. However, after about a month, it warped pretty badly. I never emersed it in water, but did 'wipe off' with a damp rag or paper towel..."
5,Best Manufacturers 14-Inch Baking Peel,I purchased this Pizza Peel in November 2007 and have been using it regularly take the Pizza out of the oven. I wash the Peel in water (no soap) and hang it up to dry. It has held up well to nearly for year of regular use. I have not experienced the warping the other reviewer mentioned. I am quite happy with my purchase and recommend the purchase of this peel.
5,The very best of Chris Botti,Absolutely wonderful music to chill out with after a hard day at work. Allows all the stress to flow out of your body.Chris is definitely top three trumpet players. His concerts are incredible.
5,The Very Best of Chris Botti,I have just recently found a good jazz station to listen to here in Vegas and am just finding out who the good artist are. I bought this CD based on reviews by other customers on this site. I am glad that I did because this CD is awesome and I like to be able to put in a CD and listen to it all the way through. I enjoy listening to this CD and I am adding to my collection of CD's.
3,The Very Best of Chris Botti,"It was good, I'm glad I bought it. Wasn't as good as I was hoping he is a talented man with a smokey, moody, ghostly horn,wanted to hear more of that."
3,Best of Botti,This early CD by Chris Botti is not one of my favorite Botti CDs and does not compare to the later and more recent Botti CDs. It's is just the selctions and the musical accompanyments. I found the title of this CD to be misleading since the other Botti CDs I have purchased on Amazon are much better products.
2,"Good, but not great...",I felt a bit like I was standing in an elevator. This was my first experience with Chris's music and I am not sure I am going to buy anymore without hearing it first. I felt that his album was a bit uninspired and did not feel that he was willing to take any chances with his music. I like music that moves me...this album did not.
2,Disappointed,"Of the three Botti CDs I have bought, I liked this one the least. All new songs with which I was not familiar. Prefer the oldies. A knock on me, not him."
5,the very best of chris botti,excellent..we thoroughly enjoyed it. arrived in excellent condition..on time
2,Limited color schemes,"I was looking for color palettes for Victorian houses. This was VERY limited to only a few house elevations and SLIGHT variations on the color schemes. I haven't read through the text but for what I was looking for, it wasn't worth it."
1,FAIL! JUNK!,"Very disappointed in this product. I'll give you the pros and cons. PROS: None! CONS: Everything about it... 1) It falls apart way too easy. You have to triple check that it is screwed together properly and even then , after you are sure it's screwed together properly, half the time it still falls apart. 2) It falls off the power head very easily. You have to attach it to the power head after the power head is positioned in the tank and even then it falls off half the time. 3) It Does polish the water and filter stuff out, then again, it does NOT! Let me explain: It will polish the water nicely. You can see it eagerly sucking in little bits of debris. Only one problem...when you are done with it, 90% of everything it sucked up dislodges as soon as you touch it when you want to remove it from the tank. So all the gunk you just polished from the tank is now floating in your tank again!!! So bottom line is, it is utterly useless."
2,How does it attach!?,"It says this will fit my powerhead (from the same company), but I seriously just can't figure out how. The directions are no help either.... So its just sitting in my cabinet waiting for a magical hand to make it fit on there."
1,good product but doesn't work for me,it is a good product but not for aqua clear 20 filter. I wrongly purchased it. it won't fit to the head. five stars for product and zero star for not working on aqua clear 20.
1,Too long,"They should post the length of this and the length of the power heads because together, they were too long for my tank."
5,Nice & Lovely,Rayvon's been around for several minutes. He has a nice voice and a good sense of personal style. This song is a slinky pop tune that will slide you across the dancefloor. I can'tr wait to hear what his full-length album sounds like.
5,Station Wagon A Tribute to America's Workaholic on Wheels,You don't see many books about station wagons. That alone makes this an interesting read. Most of us grew up with them. Lots of good pictures and covers different brands. Worth having for your car book collection.
2,Not good,"Ihad bought a few books by Kowalke (Standard Catalogs), there are Ok, but this one has no chronological or label order."
3,Just ok,Decent story with okay character developement. The action was fine but did not live up to the hype of the reviews. For better martial arts action read Barry Eisler.
4,best of the shelter recordings,"Great stuff, good crossover into more of a rockin' sound without losing the Texas and Chicago blues influences. Original recording is of poor quality and can use a remastering but the blues of Freddie King comes through."
4,LEGACY FROM THE STARS,"Through regressive hypnosis, hypnotherapist Dolores Cannon has discovered several cases where the subjects relived other lifetimes as inhabitants on other planets in strange environments. We have lived many lives in unusual environments before deciding to journey here and learn the lessons of Earth. After our schooling is completed on this planet we will journey onward and outward to discover new worlds to explore. Earth is merely a stop-over in our long adventure. The memories of these soul journeys are recorded in our subconscious, and Dolores shows that they can be retrieved through regressive hypnosis. We are children of the Stars!"
3,This product did a great job lengthening my ...,"This product did a great job lengthening my lashes and making them much thicker. It was superior to other mascara I've used for those two reasons. The only reason I'm not going to buy this product is because it wasn't waterproof. I have allergies and it didn't bother them at all, but when my eyes teared from pollen I had mascara under my eyes."
3,A lot of planning must have gone into ...,"A lot of planning must have gone into that unique brush shape, because this product truly went on without clumps (a minor miracle) and made my lashes look fuller and thicker without being """"gloppy."""" It was also one of the easier mascaras to remove, using a cotton pad and mascara remover. On the downside, this is NOT a smudge-free mascara. I had raccoon-eyes within an hour, which goes a long way toward destroying that natural look that made me so hopeful about this mascara."
3,This mascara wasn't clumpy and I liked the ...,"This mascara wasn't clumpy and I liked the wand. However, it was difficult to wash off. (I prefer mascara that comes off easily with soap and water.) I rated it a 3 because I felt that it was an average mascara, nothing spectacular."
5,I love this card,"I own a Nikon D70, and no other card writes as fast as this in my camera. You can buy the Extreme III, but the faster speeds will only help you on the read side, most cameras simply can't write as fast as this card much less the more expensive III model.If you're looking for the best performance in a DSLR, you've found it. It will be a year or more before any cameras are made that will write faster than this card can take. It also works well under the extremes that Sandisk claims: I have a Kingston CF card that refused to work outside during a winter storm. I swapped in the Sandisk Extreme and snapped away in the snow.Buy it. You will not be disappointed."
5,"Sharp, work great on my old Wheel Horse tractor","Got these blades to replace ones on a 30+ year old Wheel Horse mower. They work great and are plenty sharp when they arrive. Use caution installing them, as I accidentally cut my finger on them when the blades slipped."
5,Keyboard,"I'm very happy with this keyboard, it doesn't have all the bells and whistles of most other keyboards that I would never use in the first place. I love the small slim profile as well. The main reason I bought this keyboard is so I can see the keys in the dark. I can see the keys extremely well in the dark so I am overall very pleased with the keyboard."
2,Gaming Keyboard,"Did not like this keyboard. I recommend the Logitech GS15 backlit keyboard- NEW model, released this September, not 2005 model which is too large for most desktops."
4,Works For Me,"I replaced my Logitech G15 with the Fatality and am overall happy with the transistion.Slim and small, the Fatality fits the keyboard shelf of my desk with plenty of room left to share with my mouse. This just wasn't gonna happen with the titanic G15.The key response is crisp and satisfying, though the key layout isn't what I'm used to gaming with. It's identical to my laptop's layout but with a number keypad.The backlighting on the Fatality isn't quite as easy on the eyes as the G15 and the lightings on/off key probably could have been better placed. Maybe as a button on the side or top of the keyboard. Where it's at now (next to right alt key) isn't very easy to find in the dark as it could be.Overall I like the Fatality more than the G15, but mostly because of the size. I never used the macro keys on the G15, so that wasn't an factor in my decision. It basically came down to a smaller keyboard or a much bigger desk. ;)"
5,Amazing,"This is the quintessential Rauhofer club experience. Close your eyes and it is instantly 5am on the Roxy floor, and you are surrounded by sweaty, half naked bodies moving as one in ecstasy. This cd is packed with sexy beats. This cd is f*cking your ears and body from start to finish."
4,"I Love Miami, Too!","I just purchased this CD. I also own Rauhofer's ""I Love New York."" ""I Love Miami"" is incredibly wonderful! I was drawn to the second CD (it's a 2-CD pack) more than the first, but don't misunderstand, I also liked the first CD. ""We Play House"" and ""Discoteka"" really can get you up and moving and the rest of the side is a constant! A couple of the cuts on the first CD brought the pace down (just a bit, though), but all in all, this is a GREAT CD!Again, I wish Amazon.com would consider half-star ratings because I would have stuck another half-star on the end of my rating. This CD is not perfect--but damn near close! Have yourself a listen and a good time!"
5,NOTHING BUT A GOOD TIME,"Here is the first collection of Poisons best known songs, and this has pretty much everything you would need for the casual Poison fan. It has the hits like ""Nothing but a Good time"" Every Rose has Its thorn"" ""Talk Dirty to Me"" and many more. Poison's music summed up the 80s in one word: FUN. Their lyrics were not the greatest, nor was the music the most technical. However, their songs were not meant to save the world or anything. Their songs were made to be on your stereo on a Friday night at a party or in your car with the volume at eleven with your windows rolled down. This collection has the perfect soundtrack for a party, or any time you just want to smile and have fun!"
5,Music Fan,I thought this CD was awesome. I've always been a Poison fan and I'm glad they made this CD. This CD ROCKS!
4,"'80's cheeze metal, but I like it.","This album won't make you stop and say ""I understand the world now."" This album was not put out for this reason. Poison was a fun band, with fun music. They cover most of the bases with this album. Its good for a few memories and a laugh or two. Makes you think ""Was I ever this young once?!"""
1,*,"The phrase ""Poison's greatest hits"" is a contradiction in terms. Thank God grunge came a long to bury junk hair bands like Poison."
2,Dead Man Walking,Musicians of old will be turning in their graves. I had some ridiculous preconcieved idea that they were good due to some relic of a memory in my mind from the eighties. I think I was becoming nostalgic. A quick few seconds of their album blasting through an exceptionally good stereo quickly ripped me back through the time warp to reality. It is quite clear that the album should be used for nothing less that an ash tray.
4,Glam and talent!,I don't agree with the previous review. Poison wrote excellent songs. The only reason I don't give them 5 stars is Devilles shade of lip gloss.
1,NO GO,Poison was more worried about how big their hair was and how many girls they could get then their music. They have to be one of the most overratted bands of the 80s. I will say that they are way better then most of the crap being made today. I saw them over the summer at Moondance Jam and I didn't even stay all the way through their show. They started out with one of the worst covers (We're An American Band) that I have ever heard. They contined with two more covers that were pathetic and that was all I could take. Their music is bad enough like the stuff on this album.
1,"Pop rock, girly rock, GARBAGE rock","I never liked poison. The production of the actual albums are very good, but then they should be......so are Britney Spears!..and why? Well, after the new wave of British Heavy metal led to talented bands like Van Halen to get on the scene and make metal enorously popular in the US, record producers wanted to cash in on the act. So, just as Disney do today, groups were manufactured into iconic figures......in the case of poison, ....lets sell sex and string a few guitars in...oh yea, and hairspray.......and call it music! Its because of bands like poison that metal in the 80s was doomed. I hate grunge, but thank god it came before metal died forever. Poison existed because girls wanted to have sex with them....and, unlike motley crue, had no point to make musicallyAVOID......unless you like manufactured tripe!!!"
1,You don't need to be a Nirvana fan in order to hate Poison,"This band sucks. I don't hate this generic sh*t because I'm a grunge loving Nirvana fan that hates the eighties, I hate it on it's own merits. You don't need to be a Nirvana fan in order to hate this cheesy tripe. I hate all hair metal. Wearing spandex, makeup and leather do not make you a good band. I admire bands that don't need a glitzy image in order to make it and just wear the clothes on stage that they happened to wear that day. Are their any lyrics more transparent than ""every rose has it's thorn""? I think not. To all you people who long for a hair metal comeback, I say, grow up and get a life."
5,POISON TOUR THIS SUMMER!,"Buy this GREAT album for a taste of Poison...and check the guys out on tour this summer with Ratt & others!REAL rock never dies! Enough of the wuss rock...let's have some fun people! Poison is one of those bands you can listen to over and over and never get tired of...catchy lyrics, good melodies...you can't beat it! Chunk the Korn and Manson albums in the garbage where they belong and get into some real rock music."
3,Good,"Awesome songs and horrible songs. Although more awesome then horrible.3 1/2 stars. 6 Awesome, 4 Good, 2 ok, and 6 horrible."
4,Fun,"Poison is a great band, even though most critics will disagree. There songs are fun and rocking. This is a great collection of there best songs and its great start for new Poison fans. Id even recommend it to anyone who likes good rock. They are better the Motley Crue."
3,The only poison album u need,Honestly who buys a poison album for their album tracks? They were good for writing hit songs and theyre all included here
5,"I Won't Forget It, Baby","All and all, Poison's GH album is definitely a wonderful CD, and I'm quite glad I purchused it. However, many people see Poison as the best hair band of the 80's, including VH1, and I see that as slightly controversial. They're awesome, no doubt about that, but the best? I dunno...Anyway, it starts with some of their bette songs (Nothin' But a Good Time, Talk Dirty to Me, etc.) and finishes off with 2 previously unreleased songs (Sexual Thing and Lay Your Body Down). All 18 tracks on this CD are gold, however, and this is definitely the best Hair Band GH Album ever. Peace..."
1,Silly,"Even by the standards of 80's haircut bands, Poison is unbelievably silly. That there are still people that take them seriously today merely proves that P.T. Barnum was a master of the understatement."
1,Overheard at Poison's sold out show at the Iowa State Fair,"""Their songs are, like, deep!""""Dude, they look like chicks but ROCK!""""Brett gave me the clap!"""
5,"Covers the ""important"" hits you know & love!!!","If your a ""true"" Poison fan, this 'Greatest Hits' CD definately covers all the hits that made Poison......Poison! All the glam, the glitz, the women, the parties....it's all here! Pick this one up today!!!"
4,AWSOME CD,"I originally bought this for the first song, I listened to the whole thing in the truck on the waay home and it blew me away with the accoustic sound of Every Rose Has It's Thorn."
4,I never liked Poison before...,"But this album completely changed my mind. My older brother plays it in the car all the time, and I especially love ""Your Mama Don't Dance"" and ""Every Rose Has Its Thorn."" It does have a sort of alternative lilt to it, which annoyed me at first. In general, I'd say buy it if you like Poison."
5,People in North Jitterbug Have No Taste,"POISON ROCKS!!! Talk Dirty to Me, Nothin But a Good Time, Fallen Angel, Every Rose Has Its Thorn, Ride the Wind, ect. These guys kick it and blow away all this alternative/Kornish garbage. Tour in Atlanta July 2nd baby!!!!!POISONPOSOINPOISONPOISONPOISONPOISONPOISONPOISON"
5,An excellent collection of Poison's ups and downs!!,"This album has Poisons greatest music with a couple of previously unreleased songs with new members to the band. In this album, you can read how Bret Michaels explains the background and meaning of each song and what the band was going trough at the time of each. And excellent album for any Poison fan!!!"
5,great music,"Can't go wrong with the Masters of the Power-ballad ! POISON ROCKS ! Some of the great music, from the age of ""big hair bands"" !"
2,waste of money,I purchased this cd for a friend for her birthday and was later disappointed to hear two of the songs skipping real bad. It was a total let down! She might as well throw the cd out since the one song that's her favorite cannot be enjoyed. I have learned my lesson: Don't buy second hand to save a few bucks...just buy it new at a real store.
3,Shower Bench Just OK,"I like the shower bench, quality is good, but it does not raise as high as I need."
3,It's an okay bench but not for the price,This seat is made of plastic which looks like wood. Its not comfortable to sit on. My butt would have big red marks on it form the slats. It started to rust at the leg connections after about a year of use. It doesn't fit into a corner well and not great for a small stand up shower. I wouldn't recommend.
1,Broken at first use!,This stool looked great in the picture and put together easily. The first time it was used the wooden seat split along the joint. This wasn't at the point of the screw placement but where the pieces of wood were glued together. Not sure if this can be fixed. Certainly not worth $60!!!
3,Teak Seat Rotted Out,"Got this stool five years ago when I redid my bathroom. Wanted sturdy teak shower seat, that still looked good. The legs were not pretty ever. But it was stable to seat on, until now. Had to order a new shower seat, because places where wood meets wood have started to have rot and mold. A four inch by two inch jagged piece just fell out of the teak top today."
1,bad seat,"this DuroMed Teakspa Corner Shower Seat is nice to look at but cracked like a week or so after being in the shower without even being used, it was barely used so it won't break further but it finally broke when we put a leg on it and almost got hurt since my foot went right through, very dissapointing"
1,Not What I Ordered,"I purchased a Duro-Med TeakSpa Corner Shower Seat, Wood that is highly rated, but I was sent a Pollenex Seat instead. The Pollenex is lower rated and lower quality and almost half the price at Amazon than the Duro-Med. When it arrived I immediately contacted the company at the number provided and was told that they do not carry the Duro-Med any longer and have replaced it with the Pollenex. The invoice that came with the order did not indicate that they had replaced the item I ordered with another, nor was there any indication that the price should be adjusted. I explained that I wanted to return this item and was told that they would email me the information to have the order picked up for return."
1,No Good for you!,"Well, I bought this for my pregnant wife so that she could shave her legs in our 3' by 4' standup shower, but this thing was a lot bigger than I'd thought, and didn't fit at all. That part was my fault. What was really pathetic was that the wood on this thing chipped after only about a week being in the shower. How is that possible for a shower stool to chip in only a week in the shower? I wonder what kind of wood this really is, because I'm skeptical that it's Teak. Anyway, I'd stay away from this one. Unless you're into lighting $60 on fire."
4,Miracle in Maryland,"The Chesapeake Bay area surrounding Annapolis is a wonderful place to live. The author of this medical fantasy story describes local neighborhoods and live experiences with focused accuracy. There is much to learn about piloting an airplane that is revealed by the author's vast knowledge of that subject but the relevance to the whole story escaped me. Perhaps, one must rise above all the details on the surface of the earth to see the whole picture and make such a seemingly simple but amazing medical discovery. The greatest asset of this book is to remind readers that helping mankind is much more important than the potential monitary reward associated with an invention or a discovery. The second most important asset of this book is the pure learning experience about historical facts from a very learned author."
4,Great Ideas!,"I have used this book to plan lessons for my secondary students who have severe cognitive disabilities. My main problem with the book is that it relies heavily on worksheets and activities that require the student to be able to read. Since my students do not read, these worksheets were not appropriate for me. I was able, however, to adapt and modify the ideas to meet my needs. As a reference tool for ideas, it is a great book."
4,Life Skills Activities for Secondary Students with Special Needs,I just started using this book 1 month ago with a developmentally handicapped class in our secondary school. I have been looking for months for suitable resources. I really recommend this book. The students are enjoying the discussions and completing the activities.
3,Review,"This book is very good if you are wanting to work on the foundations of your playing. It has a lot of finger excercises and rudiment type drills.I was looking for something that I could use right away, and impliment into my playing and did not really feel like I found it here. If you have the time and dedication I'm sure the instruction can help, but if you don't want to go back to the basics than I would look elsewhere.I was looking for maybe some new rhythms or approaches to lead playing, maybe some new insight into my approach, but got more of an elementary feel.It's kind of like the difference between learning how to read the basic notes vs giving some ideas on how to put them together. The instruction has merit, but if you have been playing for a long time and want a little more meat than milk, I would say it's not here."

4,Good read. Miran Arakelian,"Aunt Julia and the Script Writer is a deranged masterpiece, a comic coming of age story about young Mario, who has fallen in love with his sexy aunt. Interleaved with this story are the tales of a Bolivian script writer, who has enthralled Lima with his radio soap operas. The book grows progressively more absurd and surreal, as the comic inventions of the script writer lead to real-world chaos. It's a soap opera in magic realism, as if Gabriel Garcia Marquez decided to do something vancouver completely different. It's a book that is close to being autobiographical, as Vargas Llosa mined his own soap opera of his life for the material of this funny romp.Miran Arakelian"
3,A book club selection,"Didn't like much. A bit too strange, what with the whole incest thing (tho I typically like incest...). At least it created a lot of interesting discussion at our club..."
4,Wholesome in a creepy way,This is one to read for any young would-be writer that still has dreams and aspirations. Now who here never experienced a foolish infatuation for an older person as a youngster? Come on now..... Here it just so happens to be that Mario chose a vivacious free spirited woman who turned out to be his aunt.
5,Brilliant and Hilarious,This is one of those novels where every character is so perfectly drawn that you instantly have a complete picture of them. And they are all completely lovable and laughable. One of the most delightful books I have ever read. Genius.
3,A collection of short stories within a novella.,"Fairly typical Vargas Llosa. The novella has two components. First, there is the semi-autobographical tale of a hidden writer who falls in love with an older divorcee. Second, there are a sequence of short stories meant to be the radio soap operas of a Bolivian scriptwriter. Eventually, the soap operas distract too much from the story and become tiresome (this may be the point). As with other Vargas Llosa texts, the plot dominates the characters. However, the plot is frequently put on hold while the short stories go on. Not a difficult or hard read. I would recommend it."
3,Aunt Julia and the Scriptwriter,"Well written, but contrived and convoluted stories akin to watching soap operas, which I don't. I enjoyed the humor and details of geography and family, but became impatient when the stories became more and more ridiculous. It was enjoyable, but should have been half as long."
4,Exelent choice for people who likes sensuality.,"I think is an exelent description about desire, sensuality and how it is to do somehing ""unaceptabel"". I liked it. I'm peruavian as well and I can say that I actually didn't know so much the culture and how young people though in the 50's in Peru. I'm young and live in Europe. I was in Lima two months ago since a long time. I could see that no so much has changed. I like Mario's way to describe things. ""He is natural and touching."""
3,Great beginning; Disappointing ending,"I bought this book as I was going on a trip to Peru and wanted to read some ""Peruvian"" literature before I left Canada. Although the book did provide me with details of life in Lima, it was not a story to my liking. Llosa begins with a bang and I was enraptured in the tales of the protagonist as he struggles with his life. However, the author does not do a good job of closing the many stories which are entwined in the book; I was left waiting for more."
4,Love the Book but Found it Difficult to Understand,"I loved the story-line and premise of a young man's love with an older women. The scriptwriter portion of the story, however, was just a little too complicated for me to understand."
2,I'm glad I borrowed this book from the Library,I had high expectations for this book but what a letdown...it was just plain dull.
5,A delightful example of Vargas Llosa's talent,"The author weaves the story of a young man (18) who woos his older aunt (32) in with stunningly interesting ""soap"" scripts which are written by a fictitious Bolivian writer -- a series of stories within an overarching one. Most of the action takes place in Lima in the late 70's, but, as is the case with ""universal literature"" -- Vargas is a Nobel Prize winner after all --it could have taken place in many new world big cities of that time from New York to Buenos Aires. The author reveals a light touch, even when he deals with grim subjects. It is really worth reading."
5,happy with this product,I bought 2 sets of these as a Christmas gift for my husband. They are a great size and a nice clean design. Very pleased with them.
1,Disappointing; not what I expected,"This book explains how to use the 'PocketC' programming application, which is *not* the 'C' language.What I was especially disappointed in was the fact that 'PocketC' does not create stand-alone *.prc files which will run on a PDA device. Instead, any program created with this application must be run on the PDA *in conjunction with* a separate runtime application.Sorry. Not for me."
4,A great way to get productive with PocketC,"I had never done any C programming before buying this book. I had done some basic in high school and arexx after but had never progressed beyond hello world in C. Granted PocketC is not ""real"" C, but when I comes to getting an idea from your head to your palm it fits the bill almost perfectly. You are introduced to all the basics of working with pocketC in this book. Unfortunately it does not really cover the PDE version. If you read all the documentation that comes with the program and the parts of PToolBoxLib that you will need though, the total becomes more than a sum of its parts. In less than a month I had the basic understanding of how to go from an idea to a working project and would not have made it without this book. If you couple it with a standard text on C you will be able to work through most of your problems. It is to be noted though, that pocketC apps are kind of slow. But I think the upside more than offsets the downside."
2,"Gibson Escapade Dinnerware Set, RED","This is a nice set of dishes only, they aren't red. The color is a deep orange- not red. I needed red dishes for a ""Red Letter Day"" gift. I returned them."
5,... good way to start my day ...,"Very positive and healthy, for both mind and body!!!!! Because, as we know, ones mental state dictates how healthy we ultimately are physically."
5,Fat ass no more!,"I love burgers and fries and if you do too, this is a great book. Great tips and tricks for losing weight. An easy read, and not boring! You don't have to give up the things you love because you're trying to lose weight."
3,Just okay.,"I bought this book mainly because of the great reviews. I found the book to be just okay. It was easy reading about a subject I am interested in. I didn't think there was any great insight found in this book. Most people know that to lose weight you have to eat less calories and work out. That pretty much sums up this book. I didn't learn anything new, but more importantly to me I didn't get any motivation nor was inspired by the words in this book."
2,I just don't agree,"Am I the only reviewer here who just ""doesn't get it""? First off, this book will tell you nothing you didn't already know (eat less and you will lose weight, DUH!!). What bothers me is how much this author says she eats in order to lose weight and maintain it. A handful of nuts for breakfast, lunch is whatever she wants--cheeseburger, fries, whatever...then comes dinner. Popcorn or a chicken strip or two??? You've got to be kidding? Nobody can survive on that!! Absolutely no snacking is allowed. It just doesn't seem like a very healthy way to lose weight."
2,No solid advice and promotes unhealthy eating,"Kim Rinehart did not do a great job on this book in my opinion. She says it's ok to eat cheeseburgers and such all the time if you have a smaller meal later, but it's not healthy. She uses vulgar words and it is not necessary because she is neither funny nor insightful in this book. I tried to finish the book as fast I possibly could because it was dull and the advice she gave was not sound. Would not really recommend this book for anyone who is seriously thinking about losing weight or eat healthy. I don't think you can really lose solid pounds of fat with this book."
2,A bit trite,I decided on this book over another one based on the reader reviews. It sounded like it would be a great read and that I would get a lot out of it. Unfortunately that just wasn't the case. It was extremely trite and written as though the author was speaking to a teen instead of full grown women/men. I just really didn't get anything new or inspiring from it and quite frankly I wish I could return it for a refund.
2,"Honestly, not impressed...","For some reason, I expected this book to tell me something I didn't already know. It didn't. I think we all know what she has to say, it just reinforces the age-old ""eat less, move more"" theory to weight loss. She does present it in a ""No B.S."" kind of way, but there just isn't a lot of content to begin with, and in my opinion, none of it was new."
5,"Underrated, a gem","Although you might first look at it and think that this is a compilation album, you'd be wrong in so many ways and you'd be missing out.The album is live and acoustic performances. Now I am not normally one for ""live"" albums - most of them having no soul and slowing the songs down considerably vs. the polished studio tracks - this works for a couple of reasons: the live tracks don't lose much in their rockiness, energy and tempo & the acoustic tracks that are here are excellent choices, being the more mellow tracks (like a personal favourite: Taking on the World).I thought this was a great album, from a band I must confess I had forgotten about. After hearing this it's put me in the mood to dig out some of my older albums.......now where can I find a turntable...."
3,Warning! Same as 2 previous cookbooks?,"Judging by the pictures on the cover, this appears to be identical to the 2 previous cookbooks that have been published by Nicola Graimes: The Vegan Cookbook and Vegan Cooking for Health (I already made the mistake of buying both of those). This may be a good cookbook, but be careful not to buy all 3 versions of it!"
2,"No esta mal, pero pobre en informacion","El libro contiene informacion fundamental sobre Visual Basic pero en cada capitulo solo hace mencion a los temas, la explicacion es muy pobre en cuanto a contenido se refiere. Los ejemplos no son amigables para entender."
3,This is not a love story!,"Wuthering Heights in not a love story unless one defines love as the most selfish, base, greedy, unpleasant and ungenerous of emotions.It might be called ""passion"" of a distinctly warped, and twisted variety, but certainly not ""love"".Heathcliff is an unregenerate sadist; a psychopath wreaking havoc on every innocent in his orbit. If I'd been a character in the book, I'd have murdered him.I did, admittedly, read the book with great interest...and was thrilled when the [...]died. I do so love happy endings."
4,You must get this movie,"I saw this movie on TCM and I LOVED it! I do not want to give it away, but this movie will keep you in suspense. The ""homicidal"" character is AMAZING. YOU MUST SEE THIS MOVIE. You will love it as well. As soon as I knew that AMAZON sold it, I bought it right away. A very good addition to anyone's DVD library. If you loved Psycho, you will love this movie."
5,great gift,Got item on time. Gave as gift to father for xmas & he loved it!! Great price - reaction from a Rascals lover PRICELESS!!
3,Articulating a Musical Spiral,"Branca's Fifth is one the densest and most difficult symphonies to which to listen. At times, the music suffers from the lack of clarity with which the masses of guitars are able to articulate the complexity Branca seeks to achieve. However, the first movement articulates a music never before heard anywhere else, and is eerily beautiful. This is not my favorite Branca symphony, but one to which I sometimes return to discover something new."
5,A UNIQUE AND INFORMATIVE ADVENTURE,"Inside the front cover of the book it tells about Lewis and Clark beginning their journey up the Missouri River to the Pacific. Eighteen months and 4,000 miles later they reached the Pacific ocean.Almost 200 years later Bob and Mike Webster climbed into their homebuilt airplane and followed the footsteps of Lewis and Clark. It was a unique adventure, highly informative, and a great source of history. There are more than 500 photographs in the book and 350 excerpts from the journals of Lewis and Clark and members of the expedition. Each photograph has with it the date the expedition passed that point.The Aircam which Bob and Mike flew has an open cockpit, two seats, and two ""pusher"" engines. It cruises at 60 to 80 mph. On page 266 it tells all about the plane and shows ""work in progress"" photos while the Aircam was being built.I found this book very interesting and enjoyable to read."
3,Surprisingly Pleasant,"The synopsis of the novel was not enough to make me run out and purchase the book, but surprisingly it was better than expected. The novel may have been better had it not been written without narration. Although it had its moments, but believe me there were some droughts. However, this is a good book for anyone because everyone has been influence by some form racial complexity."
3,""" A Disappointment ""","I was awaiting the release of this book after reading ""No Regrets"". However, as soon as I started reading the book I soon regreted purchasing it. It was not as interesting or attention holding as previous books by Patricia Haley, but it did touch on a very controversial matter (inter-racial dating)."
3,I agree with previous reviewer,"The subject matter has been better handled in another book. See Boaz Brown, for example. This book was definitely not a page turner. The story was too predictable and it took Courtney way too long to stand up to her family."
1,What Happened to Patricia Haley's Writing?,"I am surprised at Ms. Haley. Her other book No Regrets was good. She wrote this book, Blind Faith, without feeling it. I did not like it at all. Too many narratives. Characters were too flawed. Maybe she should try writing a sequel to No Regrets cause this book just wasn't happening. It was so boring. No recommendation on this one."
2,good for gag purposes only,"I have a buddy who's into electronic gadgets -- and likes to go camping as well. I thought this would be the perfect gag gift.It's a battery-powered marshmallow toaster. There are three prongs to hold three marshmallows. When you press the button, the fork rotates.Unfortunately, this is best used for a gag gift, as it is not well-made. If you actually plan on using it for seriously roasting marshmallows, you're going to be disappointed. An actual campsite test of this gadget revealed that the main spindle is too short for a real fire, meaning that you're going to end up melting the plastic of the handle or burning your hand before long. Perhaps they sell extenders separately?"
5,great music,The item is as described on the website and it was easy to use and install. It has given a great look to my car and the family enjoyed it.
1,Karaoke Kopycat,This CD was a great disappointment. Sounds like a karaoke machine behind a bunch of singers.
1,Where's My Stuff,"I have never received my order. I was notified It was mailed to me on the 27th of Dec. 2001 and has never arrived. It is now Jan.07, 2002.I agree, Where's my stuff"
3,Beware of the remix,"My mother had this on vinyl and I stole it when I moved out! ...LOL! ...and now I have it on cd. I love the cd but the remix touch they put on, particularly, the ending of my favorite song ""Merry Christmas All"", is very disappointing. The original vinyl is better."
2,SALSOUL WHAT ARE YOU GUY'S DOING PEOPLE !,"I'AM NOT SHAKEING ANYTHING BUT MY HEAD SAYING WHAT THE HELL THEY GOT MY MONEY AND I GOT DOO,DOO ONECE AGAIN ! THE LP WAS BETTER JUST LIKE SOME OTHER BACK IN THE DAY ALBUMS PUT ON CD IT SOUND'S LIKE THE LIFE WAS KILLED OUT OF IT LIKE DISCO GOLD BUY HOT PRODUCTION MESSING UP THE DANCE OR DISCO EXPERIENCE IF YOUR PUTTING LP'S ON CD'S REALY RE-MASTER THEM LIKE OTHER CD'S HAVE DONE THANK YOU..P.S. GET THE LP IF YOU CAN GET IT SAME FOR THE MASTERSERIES THE CD SUCK'S THEY SOUND LIKE BOOTLEG !"
3,Disappointing,I saw this event live on pay per view and taped it in 1991.The only reason I ordered this was I lost the tape. This totally stank. It was.nothing like the pay per view. All the back stage interviews and events were cut out.
1,amazingly banal tripe,"It's amazing how some people are overwhelmed by the minimal. These voices are at the end of the golden age and the end of their careers. Yes, Domingo still thrashes about on the stage but singing one note and resting on his laurels. The Met was once a great house and this is the end of that age - without the greatness. Don't waste your time on such trivia. Had this been done a couple decades earlier with REAL voices (Nilsson, Tucker, Merrill, Moffo, Peters, Tozzi, Hines) and REAL conductors like Cleva instead of that idiot Levine, Then you'd have seen what the Met was all about. This isn't it except for the easily impressed and who don't know opera."
2,Not one of Barbara Michaels' finer ghost stories,"The Crying Child is one of Barbara Michaels' earlier efforts, and the setting is a promising one: an isolated, sparsely populated Maine island. The ghost-story part of the plot was appropriately chilling. And I found the heroine rather engaging: very young, a bit awkward, but plucky and down-to-earth. However, it's clear that Ms. Michaels didn't spend much time on developing the other characters in this novel, esp. the ""hero"", a small-town doctor whose grouchy, graceless demeanor is clearly meant to mask a heart of gold. Ms. Michaels' writing is so clumsy, though, that I found him to be just, well, obnoxious. The other characters, like the neurotic sister, aren't presented much more sympathetically, so I for one didn't much care if they were all carried off by ghostly apparitions."
3,"The Crying Child, a story full of terror and excitement.","An appealing and facinating book about a wealthy household dealing with their terrifying family history. The author keeps one in suspense at all times, making it hard to put the book down."
5,Chilling,"I found this to be a very chilling tale. I couldn't put this book down and I look forward to reading other titles by Mrs. Michaels. The suspense is amazing as you find there are more than plenty of suspects, but that you never suspected the actual evil doer."
5,Creepy!,"A big house and a cliff. A mysterious child crying, a locked door leading to a nursery in a tower. A cemetery in the woods. A mysterious gravestone. Someone out there, in the dark, on the lawn...proceed with caution as the author guides you, the reader, to each of these points of interest.I enjoyed this book, and am looking to see what others by Barbara Michaels I haven't read. I like the way her books keep me up late at night, and looking forward to picking up her book again in the morning."
3,not enough dog,"This is a pretty good story but if you're buying it for the dog factor (which I was) do not bother. The dog plays a much larger role in the title than in the storyline. Although I am enjoying reading of Wright's journey & I do appreciate her style of writing, I purchased this in hopes that it would be a story of the relationship between a woman & her dog on a journey of self-discovery. It is not. I think the dog just sounded good in the title."
5,"One of the best, most overlooked books of the summer","I thouroughly enjoyed this book and am surprised that more people haven't jumped on the bandwagon in declaring it one of the best books of the summer. Wright's revealing, funny, and ultimately soothing tale of her escape from love only to find it in its true form is a winner. It's always comforting for people of all ages and background to know that they aren't alone - and who hasn't struggled with doubts that they're making the correct decisions in life? Learning to Float lets readers comiserate, laugh, and come away with a sense that it's all going to be alright in the end. Two thumbs up."
3,"Average effort at various habitats, strategies, gear.","An admittedly biased viewpoint from an author who would prefer to not hunt if he could not hunt with a dog - many do not have access to dogs, and are still successful.With that limitation in mind, Mr. Smith provides a decent introduction to each bird's habitat and habits. His knowledge and preference for woodcock shooting clearly dominates the book.On par with other general works on upland shooting - therefore, three stars."
3,It's Eminem all right,"This CD takes Eminem's chart topping single and puts it on a CD for your listening pleasure. I don't think the Way I am is his best song. You're better off buying his entire album (The Marshall Mathers LP), because the album features better songs as well as this one. Make the right choice."
5,The Best Klezmatics Yet!,"This albumn is the best one I have listened to. Some songs on there i cannot, get out of my head. Every real fan of klezma should buy this albumn. OY!"
3,It has some good papers in it,"This book was required for a class and some of the stories were old writings that were biased but some of the stories were thiught provoking. It has papers and essays on Marriage, homosexuality, fidelity, language, sexualt assualts abortion and adultery. The subject of thepapers range so there is something to fit anyones preferences."
1,Don't waste your time or your money,"I have ""discovered"" this book through a humanities course in college, and I have to say, it is the greatest waste of money ever. The book is full of opinions of ... who have been burned by love and sex, and have nothing better to do with thier time than to sit and stew about it. I think it is ... that such reading is necessary for a degree... What a waste of time!"
5,Great product,"I traded in my 2003 GMC Yukon on a new Toyota Sienna. I thought I'd lost my quality XM Radio reception forever, but gas mileage being what it is......I took a chance with this Roady2. I am not technically inclined and worried what I was getting into. I received the receiver as advertised. I followed the directions within the box and was pleased how easy things went.A previous review suggested how to use the vent clip mount. That was sooo easy! Another reviewer said he put the antenna on the dash, so I did the same.I called XM Radio and transferred my XM Radio account to this new receiver. It took about 45 minutes, but when the connection took place I was extremely pleased with the reception. The sound is the same quality as received in my GMC Bose system.I am a happy customer. Thanks as well to Amazon!"
1,Doesn't work.,My boyfriend tried it and the damn thing didn't work. It was suppose to be brand new so how in the hell does it not work??
5,New Roady 2,"I ordered this Roady 2, after one I previously owned went bad. I searched on E-bay and Amazon.com for a new and or used one I decided to go with Amazon (new one), as I did not feel like playing the bidding and watching game. The Roady 2 is getting harder to locate now and I felt the price on Amazon.com was very reasonable. It was shipped quickly, as I was notified that it was on its way. Delivery was prompt. I cancelled the defective unit with XM and added the new one and it is up and functioning perfectly. It is mounted on a BMW touring motorcycle.I have ordered a few things from Amazon.com and have yet to have a problem with price or shipping. Keep up the good work."
4,Great Little Unit,"Easy to use, Very Small, and Priced Right. I love the unit I have, it works great for those long road trips. The only gripe I have is that it doesn't display the whole name of the song if the title is too long. Also it would be nice if it displayed the Artist name. This is a minor thing however and for $50-$100 less then most any other player, I can live with an abbreviated song name. This one is a keeper guys!"
1,Not worth my hard-earned money!,"I planned to subscribe to XM Radio. But after reading the review by FOX, I decided not to subscribe based on the fact that XM lowered the audio quality after Apr 2006 by adding more channels. If you listen to XM mainly in your car, then the poor audio quality may or may not affect you."
5,outdated and overpriced,"I love the Roady2, but cannot believe that Toyzz is charging $169.99 for this unit. It originally sold for only about $69.99, and it sold off on eBay for $20 each after it was discontinued.Buy the RoadyXT for less than $50."
5,Fantastic,"I have had this product for a couple years. I am an Over the road truck driver and it stays on 24/7. Bottom line Fantastic! Good price, always works. Best investment I ever made."
5,Love it!,"My husband and I have each had the Roady 2 for more than a year now and have had absolutely NO complaints. Despite the advent of newer and ""nicer"" models, we have no wish to upgrade. This version is dated but works like a dream. I use mine with the cassette adaptor and get great sound. My husband has no cassette player in his JEEP, so he uses the built-in FM modulator. It took us awhile to figure out where to place his antenna, but that is simply because the JEEP has a soft top. Once we placed it and found a clear station, the Roady 2 has never failed him. Save your money and buy this version!"
3,aquaharry,"I've had the Roady 2 for about 1.5 years and have been very happy with XM radio performance (I move the unit from car to home to boat) and the performance has been great. My problem with the Delphi Roady 2 is the connections. First the yellow tip in the car DC power connection came off the plug and lodged in the power socket on the radio thus preventing me from using other power connections for home or boat. Delphi advised me to cut the tips off the other power connectors so they would make contact. This worked and put me back in business with all power supplys. Next the line out socket (center connector where the tape cassette adapter and line plugs for other stereo systems plug in) stopped working with all adapters. Dephi tech support informed me that there was internal damage which could not be repaired and since it was out of warranty, I should buy a new one. It seems to me that this unit which initially cost $100 should have lasted more than 18 months."
3,DONT BUY IT FOR THE FM TRANSMITTER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Well, Ill start by saying the roady is a great alternative to a built in XM deck.PROS:1) Easy instalation with the supplied mounting bracket2) Price3) XM has great music, equal to sirius4) Screen color change is way coolCONS:1) Wireless FM modulator sounds like garbage.2) Wireless FM modulator had HORRIBLE sound quality3) Wireless FM modulator sound like AM radio with poor reception.4) See #1-3 again5) The antenna is tricky to mount and i dont know how well it will hold up to snow rain and ice. I guess ill find out, though.....Basically, the tape adaptor is the only way to go beccause it sound clear and crisp and great through the cassete adaptor. I know 99 percent of you dont have a tape player in your car, so DONT buy this unless you do. If you have a tape deck in your car( My 02 Tacoma has cd and tape) then i higly reccomend this product."
1,What have I done WRONG?,"I receive a good signal about 10 minutes of each hour ROADY2 is turned on in my van. Most of the time is filled with no sound at all or every kind of noise you can think of. I spend a lot of time driving between Wisconsin and Tennessee. I tune theFM van radio to a clear frequency and tune ROADY2 as I move from one city to another but have no luck enjoying good sound.There are days when I get a good signal when parked in my driveway and then on the next several days there is no signal, only noise.I have talked to and emailed XM and have been told that they have no clue what is causing my problems. Yesterday I started the van in the garage and roady2 came on with the best, clear,beautiful music it has ever made. I backed out into the driveway under clear sky,no trees, no hills to block any signal and lost the signal and have not heard anything but NOISE since.CAN ANYONE HELP?Thanks,SLY"
2,XM is great! Delphi sucks...,"I bought the roady2 at sears as a Christmas present and now the faceplate has no display. The light comes on and the channels change, but there is nothing on he screen. I can't return it to the store and Delphi says I have to send it in to be fixed. How annoying!"
2,BAD CONNECTIONS,"I agree with the 'positives' of other reviewers - it is a nice product, when the connections are functioning.However, after only a few months usage, the power jack of my FIRST Roady2 quickly became loose inside; and haphazardly gave power randomly on-and-off.With warrenty I received another module that lasted a little longer, but the same issue cropped up - bad connection between adapter power plug and module's jack. I've read that other Roady2 users have experienced the same defect. A Delphi associate reluctantly admitted that he's familiar with complaints of this weak link but a repair would cost me more than purchasing a new module."
3,"Lots to like, but ...","This little receiver (and accompanying package) is really a cool setup ... HOWEVER ... the FM transmitter/modulator is the weak link. It has 2 serious shortcomings. (1.) The signal is pretty weak. Other items plugged into my other power outlets in my car interfere with the signal (especially charging my cell phone). To be fair, it's barely noticable with music channels, but with voice channels (news, comedy, etc.) it has an annoying hiss if I have other devices plugged in. (2.) It doesn't transmit on all FM channels. In fact, it only transmits on 88.x and 107.x I drive in areas where all the channels in these ranges pick up some sort of station, so my Roady2 competes with distant stations. Overall, I'm satisfied with it, but with a little more effort, Delphi could have had a home run with this little guy."
3,Like XM...HATE THE BAD QUALITY OF THE WIRES,"I like XM, but I am giving 3 stars because of the cheap wiring. I have had the Roady for about 2 or 3 years now and I am on my 5th set of cables. I handle the unit very gently, but the cables are so flimsy that the wires break nevertheless inside the plastic coating. I am tired of buying new wiring over and over, why can't they make this more durable. Also, I have to use the radio feature the cassette accessory does not work in my car (Toyota Avalon); the unit keeps spitting out the cassette. (The same happened to a friend who drives a Honda Accord) Not a real problem for me since I don't travel much, but it may be a consideration for others, because you would have to find a new station constantly in order to get reception."
4,Roady2,"Im really in the same boat as reviewer S. Conley. The roady2 is a very user friendly XM receiver. I had the unit installed myself in about an hour, with all wires aesthetically pleasing and hidden (only exception is where they plug into the unit).Yes the buttons are small but manageable. Several mounting options are available and useful. I currently use the wireless FM modulator, I can't complain. It sounds crisp, clear and better than your FM stations. The only problem I have is an occasional weak signal, depending where I'm driving.I would have appreciated the remote being packaged with the unit though, it's almost a necessity while driving. (...). The only other thing I wish was different is to have an option to display the channel, artist and song at the same time, currently you can have only two of the three displayed at a single time."
1,Can not rate it if you can't hear it.,"Bought this unit so I could have XM in my office. Live in a semi-rural area and public radio reception is hit and miss. Have Direct TV at home and they use XM for the music channels so decided to pay to have at work.Have pointed the antenna south, north, east, west and upside down and still no signal. And yes before anyone chimes in I have a window and a clear view of the southern sky.All I have is an expensive paper weight that says no signal. No signal is no music, no music is no rating and no rating means one star."
3,Great brand. Not so good quality,"I bought these after I had bought a pair of the same type and size at the Miami Boat Show from an unknown brand for $350. I really thought these would be sooooooo much better, given the brand name. I have to tell you I am a bit dissappointed. The optics quality is a hair better than the $350 pair. Definitely not worth the price difference. I'll keep them but wouldn't recommend paying this much for them.The seller was awesome. Everything happened as I would have expected. Numerous emails to let me know how the proces was going and quick delivery."
2,I love British humor,But this stuff is so corny! We winced at some of the lines. It is worse than Jerry Lewis! Now I've really insulted the Brits!
3,Great additon for anyone who likes/loves Animal Kingdom,I always like to know what is going on behind the scenes. Just got back from Disney World in Feb 2012. Had a great time at Animal Kingdom. Wanted to know how they came up with the ideas for the park. This goes into real depth on the ideas behind this wonderful park.
4,Smooth,"Caress gives you the feeling of smoothness afterward. Not only that, its fragrance is very nice. Only give 4 of out 5 because it is very good compared to some of its peers but not the best out there"
3,Not quite what I was expecting,"I had a bunch of hanes boxer briefs that I've had for several years. I thought these were the same, so I got a few packages. These are not the same. Though, they are very similar. The issue I have with these is that on the bottom of them, there is a band around the leg. NOT an elastic band. It's a hard, unflexable band. It makes these pretty uncomforable at times, especially when laying down, or moving around a lot. If not for that, I would give these 5 stars, but as is, I can't recommend these."
1,Not for skinny guys.,"I am 6' 175#, and they just don't fit right. Baggy all over, and I prefer having a contoured front. but it is a well made product, delivered quickly, just not happy with how they fit me. I will be donating these to the GoodWill."
2,get what you pay for,"Inexpensive but the fabric is not comforatable. I dont know what else to say since these are ""plain"" ""cheap"" boxer briefs."
1,Not that great,"After my first workout they stretched and looked more like boxers. The quality of the material doesn't look good either, so I don't expect them to last long."
2,Eh,"Not a huge fan. I just don't find them very comfortable, and they fit rather large I think. Someone suggested Merona, I think Champion is also a great brand. Hanes makes terrific shirts, don't care much for these though."
2,Short shelf life,"I used to buy the Hanes boxer briefs about every few months. The reason is because they're great for the first couple months but after that, having gone through several washings and dryings they begin to thin out and develop holes in the crotch area. I found the solution and will share it with you. Go to Target, find some Merona brand boxer briefs and buy them. I've had these things forever and they're just as good and comfortable as the Hanes or Fruit of the Loom brand (which incidentally do the same crotch thinning thing) only the Merona brand never thins out or deveolps holes in the crotch area like those do."
1,Wrong size,There is a 2XL sticker on the package I bought which is good because I wear 2XL boxers. The boxers however are all medium according to the wash tag and the size chart on the back of he package. Unfortunately I'm not sure I can return them since I opened them tried them on and have been using a few of them as rags because I failed to notice they were the wrong size. I don't blame amazon or the seller for that. Looks like a mistake made by Hanes mislabeling their product.
1,Overrated!!!,This product looks good on picture. But actually I waisted my money. They are not comfortable at all. After two days of wearing them they turned into rags. They stretched and looked awful. I couldn't believe that I spent my money on something like that. Usually I'm pretty careful about what I buy but this are just awful. And one more thing. They are so thin that when they stretch on your body you can see through. Thanks
4,Midland Came Through,"We bought 2 pairs of radios and 2 charger kits. Nothing in the instructions warns against deep-cycling the batteries. I fully charged all 4 batteries the first time, then left the radios on until the batteries were fully discharged. Three out of four of the batteries would not recharge. I hope they'll replace the batteries, but still, we'll have to remember not to leave a radio on in a coat pocket or something.UPDATE: I talked to Midland Tech Service. They sent replacement batteries but also suggested that I remove the old batteries for 15 minutes to allow the radios to re-set. The ""bad"" batteries then accepted a charge. A cute trick, but I had to call Midland to get it."
4,Worth the slog,"I'll be honest with you...Philip Reiff is not an easy read. But he's well worth it. This book takes on Freud and some of his (ironically) patricidal disciples, showing how Freud was instrumental in the dismantling of faith as the organizing principle of culture. In its place, we have ""psychological man,"" whose only organizing principle is self-fulfillment. It's not hard to see where that leads: a culture adrift, pleasure-seeking individuals heedless of the needs of community, and so on. Reiff is such an incisive critic of our present situation that the only theory I have for his not being more widely read and cited is that he's just too darn hard to read. But don't let that stop you."
4,Talk About A Greatest Hits Album,"I must say this is a really great album. My favorite song on here is ""Saturday Night."" My mom and I went to a yard sale and found this 'record' (which it was) there. My mom bought it, even though we don't even have a record player, and so I took it over to my friends (who happens to be my mom's friend too!) place to record ""Saturday Night"" there. So this is a really good album for those who love, maybe, Sweet; The Beatles; ect. So if you have the money to buy this, buy it. Its really worth the money and patience of receiving this album."
1,Disappointed,"I was so excited on Christmas morning when I got a new Camcorder, It was my daughters first Christmas where she would be able to open her own presents, and the camera was not what I expected, it was very grainy and did not focus very well. In a low lit room you could not make out who were recording, I was trying to video people in the room and if there were two or more people in the shot it would only try to focus (and not very well) on one person.I will be returning this camera and hopefully getting a better one)"
1,Fell apart,"I bought this because it was the perfect size for my laptop, I liked that it had the small zipper opening in the back, and it was a good price. Within the first week the zipper pulls busted off the main zipper, making it difficult to operate (the part where they were attached also broke so I couldn't even replace the zipper pulls with something else), then a year later the zipper on the small opening in the back fell apart completely and the opening couldn't be closed again. I guess after a couple of years I did get my money's worth out of it, but what ever happened to things that last a lifetime? Had I known this would happen, I would have spent a little more money for something of better quality."
5,Familiars:Animal Powers of Britain,"A fascinating dip into the shamanic world of the witch's familiar - wild and domestic animals with which adepts can link consciousness. It includes real life testimony from people undergoing shamanic experiences [some of them quite scary, others - unexpected]."
5,Why haven't I ever heard of smog before?,"I'm rather ashamed of myself really, cuz I think of myself as somewhat knowledgable of the current music scene, yet Smog seems to have slipped through my fingers, until now. I have to confess, I only heard about Smog because I was so impressed with Chan Marshall's (of cat power) cover of Red Apples that I had to investigate...now that I have one of Smogs cds, I need more. His style is somewhat simple, yet totally unique. The tunes are generally melancholic and slow, but there are few faster ones. I'm might be a bit hasty by saying this album is flawless, but after three or four listens, I'm still waiting for something that I don't like to emerge. I don't know what to compare this to exactly except perhaps Will Oldham,...anyways, please at least listen to this on the computer...I'm pretty sure most people will like something about it."
3,solid smog,"You have to give 'ol Bill Callahan kudos for versitility. While to the casual Smog listener it may sound like same old same old, those who have delved deep into Smog's back cataolgue will be able to appreciate what a departure this is from some of his previous work. Dongs of Sevotion is worlds away from his last LP Knock Knock, which is a shame in a way, because that record contained some of the most memorable Smog songs ever (I'm thinking of Teenage Spaceship and River Guard here). This new record somewhat reminds me of Wild Love, it has the same kind of irreverent eclecticism of that release. Dongs of Sevotion is good, but didn't really touch me the same way previous Smog records have, perhaps it's length (about an hour long) is a factor in this. The last song however, Permanent Smile, with its Phil Spectoresque wall of sound, hints at greater things ahead."
3,Too Bulky.,"These are very good quality and work fine, but the grip is extremely bulky for a woman's hand. I would have preferred something with a smaller grip."
4,Shoot the Moon: The Essential Collection,This cd has all the great songs off the older albums with a few new tracks. Its a skaters flavor of the week.
5,"FAREWELL, FACES","The testament of Face to Face musical career is a sad operetta with several documentals and videos. In the top of these 2 DVD's remains the last Face to Face concert, performed at the House of Blues: a lively half and hour that goes through the early years to 2002's How to ruin everything. One of the best punk bands in years."
1,"Sorry, Not The Supremes Here","First, I'm sure these are all nice ladies and are good singers too. But of the three women in this group, one was never a Supreme at anytime. One was a Supreme for about 1 year and never sang on any of the original versions of the songs here. None of the songs here are the original versions either. The third lady was with the Supremes for their last 3 albums; and of the songs here she sang on only two of the original versions. For this album to bare the name 'Supremes' is not only misleading, it's just wrong. There isn't even one ""original"" Supreme here. Besides that, the Supremes were disbanded in 1977 and the name was ""retired"" so that not even the sole remaining original ""Supreme"", Mary Wilson, was permitted to use the name ""Supremes"" in a group. And she was a Supreme from the very begining until the end! Makes one wonder how it is that 'they' are getting by with using that name,since an 'original' member can't even use it. Yes, misleading."
3,not bad,"A little boring album but not bad. Sex and candy, poppies, saint joe on a school bus, and the shadow of seattle are great songs. If the rest of the album sounded like these songs I would definetly give it five stars."
4,A Very good CD,"This is one of the best CDs I have. However it's only about half an hour and is pretty repetative. I really like ""Poppies"" and ""Sex and Candy"".VERY GOOD CD. BUY IT!"
1,This is a really cool CD,"Yeah, I like this CD--I bought it a couple days ago. The songs sound a little too similar and are a little too depressing but I still think it's pretty cool. One reason I like it is that the songs are not completely clear and leave you something to think about. My favorite songs are ""Sex and Candy"" ""Poppies"" and ""Ancient Walls of Flowers."" The dog and his master one is the worst. It's too weird."
1,Well........,"After hearing sex and candy I had high hopes on this CD, but after hearing it through a couple of times the most use its had is as a twenty buck coaster. The music is bad, the lyrics are awful, and even the one good song cannot hope to make up for the lack of the rest, as much as I hate making bad comments about someones music, as I am a part of a band myself, to me, this CD is just awful."
1,one hit wonder,"All in all the CD is a blur of music that you listen to and you feel as though you couldn't pick any of them out as being exceptional. Of course, Sex and Candy is still fairly as catchy as it was when I first heard the song, but the album in general is too repetitve. They definitely have some talent as a few of the songs show, but they need to develop more of an identity."
2,well its there but it doesnt seem to go any further,"unfortunatley im one of those people who bought this album purely on the strength of ""sex and candy"" and whilst i love that song the rest of the albumn the hits are few and far between ""saint joe"" and ""opium"" are the only real ""songs"" on the album. the rest seem to be fairly bored little numbers which dont go anywhere. Whilst some parts are catchy, the ""one little two little three little idiots"" part on ""dog and his master"" is very cathcy, but u never seem to get the whole song in your head. the albumn is also very short 35 mins is not a great deal of time for an albumn so this is a little disappointing i would recomend this albumn to only those who love both ""st joe"" and ""sex and candy"" but dont get your hopes up, borrow first"
2,Don't waste your money on this one.,"I just think this CD is soooo not worth it. It's, like, 40 minutes long and the songs lack substance. Sure, ""Sex and Candy"" was a good song, but, well, let's just say the rest aren't worth it."
4,i love sex and candy song,I love sex and candy song thats my favorite one on this whole cd. I recommend u all to buy this cd.
5,Quirky and great,"A quirky album, sometimes crazy, but I love it. Each song has it's own appeal. Of course, everyone knows the hit ""Sex and Candy"", but it doesn't stop there. The album has a 'Fantasy' feel about it, which is accentuated by songs like ""A Cloak of Elvenkind"" and ""The Vampires of New York"". This is one of those albums that deserves to be listened to all the way through...there is not one song that could be called filler. The booklet contains all the lyrics."
5,This cd ROCKS!!,"Marcy Playground is one of the best new bands out there!! This cd was unexpectedly great!! The best songs are: ""Sex and Candy"",""St. Joe on the School bus"", and ""Sherry Fraiser."" By far one of the best cds I own!!:)"
4,"The song ""Sex & Candy"" rocks!!!","The review of Marcy Playground is that this CD is really cool! All you have to do is take a ten second intro. of all the songs and you see that this is one cool CD. My favorite song is the smash hit ""Sex & Candy"". It tells a story while having a great song being sung to you! ""St. Joe on the School Bus"" is another great song you can listen to over and over again."
3,"Chill, dude. (Try not to freeze, though...)","Not much to say about this one, really. It's mellow, downtempo, easy listening, calm, smooth...does ""stoner"" qualify? (Hey, the star track is ""Sex And Candy""; I think that's a legit question.) The problem is that downtempo needs to have something to it to be good. It can be sweet and poignant (Jack Johnson), etherally beautiful (Loreena McKennitt), heartful and upbeat (Counting Crows), or edgy (Toad The Wet Sprocket). Marcy Playground, both the band and the self-title album are...just there, unfortunately. No big hook, nothing that stands out. If you're into smooth, easy listening, you'll love this. Not a whole lot to recommend/trash otherwise."
2,Yeah!,"They only good song on this CD is ""Sex and Candy."" That song deserves 2 stars alone and it is the only reason I bought the CD. It was too quirky for me but if that's what you like, get it. I am a dissatisfied customer."
4,"Not bad, nice, classic guitar","Yeah, this band is simple, but it dosen't mean that they aren't good. Although they have simple lyrics, and easy chord progressions, they put togehter a good-sounding piece of music. A CD you'll love to play all the way threw, especially if you are a guitar enthusist. People looking for real rock or alternative, stay away from this."
5,Marcy Playground: The Review...,"Wow, what a great CD. I, like many others bought this CD for the single ""Sex and Candy"" alone but just hearing the first song, I was blown away. There are just great tunes all throughout this entire CD. The funny thing is, being that Marcy Playground only released one song to the public, they all most went into the ever-growing pile of the one-hit- wonders, but to my surprise, they are coming back. Well this is the review for this cd not the ""Shape Shifter"" one so that is all I will say for the sequel. It is a funny thing, I like this kind of band and I like a band like the Insane Clown Posse. That is kind of surprising huh?I would really suggest that anyone with a ear for GOOD music would enjoy this. I really hope the group gets all of the credit and exposure the so rightly deserve! Best of luck.Well, that is it.Have a good one!Ryan"
5,A Great CD 5+,"This CD is really really addicting. I too have had this CD for a while and I'm just now writing a review on it. This is one of my favorite CD's that I own. Every song on here is amazing! Sex and Candy, Ancient Walls of Flowers, A Cloak of Elvenkind, Sherry Fraser, Opium, Dog and His Master , and The Vampires of New York are MADLY ADDICTING! I really never figured out why they didnt release any of those songs as singles, seeing as they're 100 times better than Sex and Candy or Saint Joe on the School Bus. The lyrics and sounds are so mellow and relxing that they'll take you away into Marcy's Playground."
4,Better than expected,"I bought this cd for the song sex and candy, just like the majority of the thousands of other people who bought it. So it sat on my shelf there for a year or so until i listened to the rest of the cd, which was a pleasantly different sound floating in a sea of mediocre modern music."
4,opium,everyone should buy this cd if only for the song opium...everyone should listen to it on repeat for at least three hours...it messes with your head.you're left feeling like you've just been inside the song and you can see everything the writers were trying to depict. you have to try it for yourself...
1,"Blah, blah, blah","""Sex and Candy"" could be one of the worst and over-played songs of the year. I wish this band would just go away and never come back."
1,It STINKS!!,I recently bought this CD and it stinks! Don't buy it. Save your money and buy Matchbox 20. Thanks P.s: It is not even worth 1 star
2,Tedious,"The songs are mediocre. His songs may come across as nursery songs because of the lyrics and simple instrumentation (go to fretplay.com to see how easy the songs are to play). Nearly everyone bought the album for Sex and Candy. Actually the really bought it because it had the word ""sex"" in it. If it had been called Prunes and Candy nobody would have ought the single anyway. There's nothing much to the song or any of these songs for that matter. But the songs are generally not my personal tastes. To me they were bubblegum pop meant for toddlers. Despite the lyrics on many tracks, the acoustic backdrop made them perfect melodies for Blue's Clues."
3,I'm NOT A Huge Fan,"This music needs to be a bit ""louder."" It is mediocre and not that interesting. I would mildly recommend it. I just got this album out of curiousity, anyhow. This cd started out a little cool with the first 3 tracks {which are actually just the ones I usually ever listen to} even if I want to listen to something calm. I can do that with more satisfaction with Enya. Besides, rock music is the majority of what I listen to. This cd is somewhat just too mellow for my taste."
1,horse ***,"the definition of a one-hit wonder band. i image the only reason most people bought this cd was for sex and candy. this cd was pretty much a complete waste of money, and anyone who's ever listened to someone like jimi hendrix will understand me. also, try reading some of the good reviews of this album. they sound like they just learned to talk."
2,I MUST'VE REALLY GREW OUT OF THIS CD!,"I LOVED THIS CD A LOT WHEN I FIRST GOT IT IN 1998. I LOST IT SOMEWHERE IN 2000 OR 2001, AND I FOUND IT JUST YESTERDAY. FIRST THING I NOTICE WHEN I LISTENED TO IT FOR THE FIRST TIME IN SEVERAL YEARS IS THAT I NO LONGER CAN FIND MUCH INTEREST IN THIS ALBUM'S MATERIAL. ONLY SONGS I STILL ENJOY ARE ''POPPIES'', ''ST. JOE ON THE SCHOOL BUS'', AND SHADOW OF SEATTLE''. REST OF THE CD TO ME RIGHT NOW IS CRAP."
4,Alternative with actual talent!,"If you're looking for alternative with talent, look towards Marcy Playground. Just listen to the harmony that these guys deliver. They're not trying to impress anyone with their tongue rings or green hair, they're just playing their music. Great record guys."
4,back in stride,"Classic Salsoul Disco megamix. I originally bought Disco Boogie Volume I in 1979. I was in the military serving in (then) West Germany. It was like a gift to myself for my 23rd birthday. Extended play cassette was the format in 1979. I lost that cassette in 1982. Finally! Thirty years later the sounds are still hot. Some rarities of Salsoul excellence are 'in the mix' as well as better known tracks. Try it if you are into Salsoul, Philly Sound and Disco."
5,my absolute favorite candy,"i had these a very long time ago and had forgotten all about them until i was in the hong kong supermarket and saw them on the display. i was thrilled. my all time favorite candy for sure! lightly floral, creamy, fruity. delicious."
3,Plain ol' hard candy,"I'm not a huge fan of hard candy, but when I saw how cute the packaging was for these candies, I couldn't resist. The wrappers come in pearly pastel colors with different flowers on them. Even though the wrappers are different, the flavor is the same for each candy. It's somewhere in the realm between plum and peach, and isn't very strong. I didn't really want anymore after I had the first one."
5,Great Gift,These kid tupperware play sets are really fun and very well made. Just minture versions of the adult sets but with no BPA. Every child we have given one to has loved it when they opened it and continue to play with it for years. It feels a little expensive to buy for yourself but has made many a great birthday present for my daughter's friends and cousin.
3,Decent Assortment of Stray Cats Cuts,"Not as exciting as their powerhouse LP, ""Built for Speed,"" this collection does a so-so job of presenting the best the group had to offer. Big hits like ""Rock This Town,"" ""Stray Cat Strut,"" ""(She's) Sexy + 17,"" and ""I Won't Stand in Your Way"" as well as concert faves like ""Runaway Boys"" and ""Rumble in Brighton"" are all here, as are some unreleased tunes (for U.S. markets) like ""Fishnet Stockings,"" ""My One Desire,"" ""Give It to Me"" and ""I Fought the Law."" What hurts this album is the inclusion of their post-1986 reunion material, which lacked the drive and youthful vigor of the early 80's albums (the techno-heavy ""Elvis on Velvet"" is unforgiveably awful, but the Eddie Cochran and Gene Vincent tribute, ""Gene & Eddie"" makes up for it). Buyers should seek out the hard-to-find original albums, particularly ""Built for Speed,"" which culled the best tracks from the first two releases. All in all, this CD is not too bad, but Stray Cats fans will want more."
1,81 - 83 would've been better,"All the post-83 stuff belongs somewhere else. Like inside a garbage can.Would Gene Vincent or Eddie Cochran ever have recorded such garbage as ""Elvis on Velvet"" or ""Bring it Back Again""?"
4,The Perfect Blend,"D.R.I. is an very interesting band. They are considered one of the godfathers of the crossover scene. They originally were a hardcore punk band that put out couple of albums in 80s. They gradually absorb thrash influences as they progress. This album probably is my favorite album by them. It has the perfect blend of hardcore punk and thrash metal.I absolutely love their guitar riffs and drumming. Very thrashy and full of energy that is so well known in the hardcore punk music. Every time I listen to one of their songs, I feel like I just want to go out and mosh around! I also really dig the lyrics because they all deal with something that is important to them such as society issues, media censorship, and some personal conflicts they've experienced.Best Song: Thrashard-the perfect blend!Worst Song: Beneath The Wheel-good song but bit too long which makes it bit boring. If they cut it shorter then it would be much better.Score: 8/10[...]"
3,Playmobile policeman and motorcycle,"My grandson likes the toy. However, in an email to Learning Things, I explained that the kickstand is missing. I requested that a new kickstand be sent and have not heard back from them so right now, I'm upset as it cost $16.75, plus shipping.I am putting the bill in dispute at Master Card until this is resolved."
3,Could use a good proofreader!,"I'm reading this book for a required course on management of information organizations. The information in the book is important and useful, but the presentation is rather boring, and the book is full of spelling and grammatical errors. The publisher should come out with a new edition that has actually been proof-read!"
3,No bad as textbooks go.,"The content of this text was right on target with everything I needed to know for my course. I wish it would have detailed business cases and line item budgets in a bit more detail but overall a pretty good book. I was not impressed with the quality however. For the price of the book, the quality/appearance was pretty poor.I work for a publishing company and the quality was on par with a much cheaper/far inferior, international edition. The pages appeared hazy/grainy and the cover art looked like it had been slapped together by a high school art class. The content did provide some redeeming qualities but for $75 I expected a much nicer product."
3,...a better place to find these cuts,"These versions of many blues and soul standards are all fine, there are a couple of Freddie penned trax as well. I've read the quibbles in the All Music Guide and thru out the Freddie King reviwes listed below, but I still really like this music. Yes Leon's destinctive piano often sits on top of the mix, and the strings and backing female voices occationaly over power King's playing and mar and date the arrangements, but it's soooo good, even if it is at the end of the road for Freddie..I'd suggest picking up the 2-disc ""KING OF THE BLUES"".That CD contains all of these cuts and then some; about 60 in all, in a generous package. There are only a handful of songs that are not up to par and some that are so good you will wonder why you did not already have King in your blues collection. For those looking for a blues CD beyond Freddie's vintage 1950's classics, see ""KING OF THE BLUES""."
3,Fair piece of business.,"Freddie didn't have the longest career, but this shows he could grind out some duds once in a while. (""Lodi"" by CCR is a dumb piece for him to have done.) Ok for anyone wanting a complete set of Freddie's work."
2,Iris rambling,"I love Iris Murdoch's novels, but I don't think this is one of her better ones. I didn't even finish reading it. It feels unfocused, as if Iris were writing a great deal while searching for her real interest in the narrative. The characters are all rather dismal, and she certainly makes quite a gargoyle out of the old man. I don't think I've seen any geriatric case who is quite as hideous as Iris's Bruno. While Bruno certainly stands out in bold hideous relief, the women all seem featureless, but then all women in Iris' novels seem this way. I could be all wrong about this novel, but the book she wrote after this one, ""A Fairly Honourable Defeat,"" is her best."
3,Copy Controlled,"It is not mentioned here, but this disc is copy controlled.--- On some equipment, for example car CD players playback--- problems may be encountered.I have not listened it yet. The 3 stars are not the FA."
3,"interesting, but singer has problems","This album would be very nice, and is in places, but the singer has a bad tendency to sing flat. To some people, like me, this is very distracting. What is really weird is they fix this stuff ""in the mix"" all the time.Too bad."
5,I love this and am a metalhead? What?,"So yeah, this is just about one of the greatest CDs ever, but not quite. In its genre, it's sooo incredibly amazing. You seriously have to buy this if you are even interested in this type of thing. It's basically Spanish acoustic-type stuff with a Spanish female vocalist that almost sounds Japanese. Very relaxing stuff. My favorite song happens to be the only one without singing (""O Olival A Passo, A Trote E A Galope""), despite the fact that I love this chick's addictive hard pronunciation (though at the same time having a pillowy fading voice). You seriously have to love this if heavy metal fans can even appreciate it."
5,"A soaring, stirring piece.",Jett Hitt's Yellowstone For Violin and Orchestra is outstanding. I have not been inside Yellowstone Park but have been around the Grand Teton and Bitteroot Ranges.He has really captured the awe and majesty that one feels in the Big Sky. Those images are imprinted in my mind and this music brings me directly back there.It is rare to hear music that can summon such powerful spirits.Robert Aherne
4,One of the best 2006 CDs you did NOT hear!,"CLASSIC ROCK magazine receintly described American Plague as ""Johnny Thunders meeting Glen Danzig on the set of a Mexican snuff film... with Johnny Cash watching!"" Toss in elements of Social Distortion, John Mellencamp (!!!) and early Bad Religion and you'll have an acurite description of this CD."
3,a pervading corporate sense of audience,A conceptual sound scape in the maudlin key of melancholia. At best it bears comparison with Robert WyattComicoperaRock Bottombut at times it falls into the trajectory Floyd took after Dark Side of the Moon. Sinéad O'Connor's vocal contributions make the whole tribulation worthwhile. And thats something to entice further listening.
2,A disappointing effort from a talented musician,"I bought this record on the strength of Wright's 1977 solo album ""Wet Dream"" but it does not live up to that standard. This album is very self conscious lyrically and flat musically, even Sinead O'Connor's contribution is below par. I hate to give a negative review of this record but I would recommend listening to it before you buy it.I don't really begrudge the money I spent buying this record since I have got more than two albums worth of enjoyment out of ""Wet Dream""."
1,Consider Wet Dream the Only Richard Wright Solo Album,"After reading a lot of the other reviews, I was excited at the prospect of a good follow-up to Wet Dream. I was sorely disappointed. This was a painful listen. I gave it the requisite three listens and still could not get past my initial impression. For those out there considering expanding their love of Floyd, Marillion and early Genesis, get Wet Dream and see if you like that. If you do, don't bother with this one. If you don't like Wet Dream, then this one may be more your style."
1,Stop pumping this terrible CD...,I recently purchased this CD used at used CD shop and had to go back the next day and sell it back to the shop at a loss. It is a terrible CD and no one should waste their money on it.
4,Awesome!,"Richard Wright of Pink Floyd, what more can you say Obviously this a great album from a great musician! If you like Floyd, you'll like this."
3,Dark Pink Floyd,"Not bad, more or less what I expected from a solo Floyd album, still heavily laced with the Pink Floyd sound. I don't think you can listen to an entire album of just wright's voice, its just too spooky so the two tracks incorporating Sinead O'Connor set it off nicely. If Wright does keep his promise of producing another solo work I for one will buy it!"
5,great product,This is a great water bottle. it is a good size so it only has to be refilled at mealtime our 2 piggies Lucky and Simon love it>
4,Water bottle,Gave this to my niece for her 2 guinea pigs. The bottle works well and has not leaked. She has only used it for a week but the guinea pigs can get water without water accumulating on the cage floor.
3,"Good book, but is this a Mystery Novel ?","No need for me to give the short summary of the book again, others have done a great job doing that for me. I've enjoyed the book, that puts the reader into the lives of very believable characters in modern day Japan. It's well written, probably part due a very good translator. But I should make a note about the category the book is put into: a mystery novel. I can not understand this fits into this category. There's nothing of a mystery in this book. Everything is either obviously predictable, or just plain written before it happens. Nowhere in its 360 pages have I ever wondered ""Mmmmm, what would happen next"" or ""who would be that misterious man"". No, don't expect any suspense, thriller, or mistery. Just a plain, though bloody at some times, story. If you set that expectation, you'll have a lot of satisfaction reading it."
2,A really disgusting read,"I am writing this review because Amazon suggested I should buy it, but I have already read most of this book and found it such a disgusting experience that I did not complete it. Unless there is a twist at the end that I missed by quitting, this should not be called a mystery. No mystery involved.I was surprised that the editorial reviews were quite honest about the content and also surprised that the customer ratings are so high. I do not find reading about chopping up bodies to be appealing."
2,Just an old trick,The book is well-translated but the story is predictably boring.It's so obvious to me that the author is just trying to shock the readers by writing something unusually gruesome. This is just an old trick. Come on! Can you be a little moreoriginal?A bunch of housewives getting together to kill someone and writing about them in gory detail is not creative. This is a novel for beginners.
1,The only mystery is why anyone liked it!,"I bought this book because of all the glowing reviews - but, although well written, it is one of the worst books I ever read.By way of example, the author need only have described a character as incontinent ... I neither needed nor wanted page after page of description about the diapers, stench, etc. Learning how hourly workers on the night shift live and work in Japan was mildly interesting, but not for so many pages - and the plot seemed depressing and contrived. The book was sick, and I can't even imagine liking it. I love mysteries, and read and buy many each year - but this wasn't a mystery; IMHO, the only mystery is why anyone liked it."
4,Very enjoyable thriller/crime fiction,"Really loved the characters in this book. I had sympathy for every one of them, even the ones I was supposed to hate- even while I hated them. This book has a great dark mood throughout. I enjoyed the underlying themes of the story also (women's working lives, the difficulties of working the night shift in a factory, the darkness of the material world, how families fall apart sometimes) It's dark, yet there seems to be a glimmer of hope in a few of the characters' dark lives. It was one of those books that I had to stop everything and finish because I couldn't stop thinking about it."
4,"A Japanees ""Desparate Housewives""","I will not go into the plot since many others have already. What I will tell you is that Out is a tought thriller that places the lives of ordinary women struggling to get by into a swirling vortex of violence and deception. None of the wives could have imagined, at the outset, the horrible things they would do in the next few fateful weeks.I would recommend this to anyone who loves a good thriller (you'll keep thinking that they are going to be discovered again and again), or is interested in the daily lives of your average japanees housewife, as seen through a funhouse mirror."
1,Either poorly written or poorly translated,I bought this due to the plethora of rave reviews. Boy was I disappointed. While some of the actions reminds one of a Coen Brothers script the book is overly long and at times excruciating boring. It amazes me that anyone would describe this work as well written. there were far too many examples of the narrator blatantly telling us what should have been left ot our own conclusions. In one instance a character with a spending problem is contemplating a purchase of a handbag which leads her to realize that if she makes this purchase she will need to buy shoes. Instead of leading the reader to make their own conclusions the author then spends two additional paragraphs telling us how one need for this character leads to another.Worse still is the ending of the book which has a final and unbelievable twist that is so implausbile you will be tempted to through the book at the wall screaming I suffered through all these pages for this?
3,"Interesting, but ultimately disappointing","As a fan of both Japanese literature and crime novels, I was anxious to read this book. It started out well and overall the plot is interesting, but the ending just ruined it for me. I won't spoil it for you, but suffice it to say that it was one of the most bizzare, and absurd endings in recent memory. Kind of ruined it for me."
5,"a stunning, well-crafted story","I kept trying to read it in one go, but it's too long for that. And yet, I didn't want it to end.""Out"" is a beautifully written crime novel. You start out not knowing how these peoples' lives are going to converge or change, but then the dominoes start falling. Ordinary people do extraordinary things, but because of how she's drawn the characters, we can understand why. The plotting and pace are excellent - it's hard to believe this is Kirino's first novel."
4,The struggles of desperate women make a thrilling noir novel!,"""Out"" is a story of four women who work at a bentou-box factory and are tied even closer together by a gruesome murder.This book is absolutely horrifying (in a very very good way) and I recommend this to anyone who loves psychological thrillers. It wasn't scary in a ""pop out and AHHH!"" kind of way, but I couldn't sleep every night while (and a few nights after) I was reading it.I heard that this book even became a tv series in Japan!"
2,Disappointing and a bit dull,"I had high expectations for this book, which is probably part of the problem. I heard a positive review on NPR of Kirino's more recent book, but I decided to read this one instead based on even stronger reviews here. Unfortunately, I found the book to be dull and predictable. The characters are all some mix of unlikeable and unbelievable, with the female characters tending towards the former, while the male characters are ludicrously worthless or demented. Several of the review snippets printed in the book's cover pages refer to its feminist viewpoint, which should have been my clue that the novelist has an ax to grind. I'm giving it two stars instead of one, because although I came very close to abandoning the book midway, I was sufficiently curious to stick with it to the end. It's not clear that was the right choice."
3,Compelling but inconsistent.,"I found the first third of this book riveting. It was absolutely a page turner as most people who reviewed the book here found it to be. I was compelled by the characters; found them both moving and complex. However, when Kirino introduced the male characters of the novel her strength dwindled. She didn't have as strong a handle on her guys as she did on her women. Where the women broke stereotype, the men stayed put. I grabbled w/ the misogyny as well. It felt a bit heavy handed w/o needing to be.All in all, a good story and a great start."
5,Fun Thriller to Read,"Very few books actually keep me up past my bed time, but I had to know what was going to happen next in this book filled with twists and turns at every corner. I had read this book a couple of years ago and although, I don't remember every detail, I do remember it was one of my favorite reads in a long time. I don't remember there being any dull moments, every page had you on your toes and you just never knew what to expect next. I recommend this for anyone who likes books that keep you guessing until the very end!"
4,Out: A novel,During the reading of this novel I really wanted to be able to read Japanese. The translation at times confused me with euphimisms that I felt pandered to American expectations regarding this genre of fiction. I admired the protagonist but she unfortunatley fell in love with another. That love is what I found revolving around the central theme... and what makes the author a worthy competitor in the guessing game of looking into the well of human darkness.
4,Murder and Mayhem!!!!!!,"This novel is mesmerizing and tells the story of a brutal murder in the Tokyo suburbs. A young mother who works the night shift boxing lunches brutally strangles her abusive husband and then looks for the help of her coworkers to get rid of the body and cover up the crime. This is just the beginning of their adventures together. They become involved with the Yakuza, the Japanese mafia. Out is a thriller that also tells about women and the pressures that they feel while being consumed by prejudices and pressures from society. She had an abusive husband and probably Battered Wife Syndrome.This is a mystery thriller that will keep you on the edge of your seat!"
3,Not your American noir,"I have enjoyed some recent translations of Japanese novels for English-reading audiences and was eager to compare the conventions of American and Japanese crime stories. I think this translation is very good - it captures the tone of the Japanese language and style of speech in English quite well. I found the final 40% of the novel to be a classic page-turner, but I was very surprised that it took nearly half the book to arrive at the point where anything resembling action took place. The first half of the book is more than simply character exposition, but - compared to American books of the same genre - be prepared to wade through a lot of details and background to get the excellent payoff at the end of the novel."
3,A Creepy Thriller,"After reading 'Grotesque', last year, I decided to give 'Out' a try. I thought it got off to a very good start, as the reader is immediately immersed in the life of drudgery of the four main female characters, who work the nighshift in a boxed lunch factory, in the Tokyo suburbs.The character development, particularly early on is very good, and the writing is vivid throughout. However, I felt after the inital murder, and body disposal, the novel became less interesting for me. I'm not really sure why, as there were still a number of events unfolding in the storyline. Overall, though a fairly good, creepy novel."
3,Good,"This is a simple, charming well written fable.Not much can go wrong with the formula and not much does.A good, quick read"
3,Took four attempts and three years to finish reading it,"This is one of those books that seem to appear on nearly every ""Must read"" list. So a few years ago, I bought it and read it several times over the past years. I could never get beyond the first 30, then 40 then fifty or so pages. I found the story too slow and tiresome and the writing somewhat laboured. I eventually finished the book last month as it was a Book Club selection. I'm glad I read it because it felt like an achievement but I did not enjoy it as much as others did. To me, it felt more like a self-help book and a high-brow one at that."
4,persue your legend,"This is a book telling a boy persuing his Personal Legend through a trip to the Egypt. By reading it, I really feel my soul become calm and clear. It also helps me to recognize myself."
3,Spiritual claptrap or entertaining fairy tale?,As a liitle fairy tale this is quite enjoyable. As a primer on how to live it is shallow and vapid.
4,Excellent Advice,Loved this book great parable that is still very relevant in todays society. Should be a must read in all schools.
2,"Cheap, sentimental nonsense","This is a book that seems to be everywhere--and it's not necessarily all that new. Yet, any airport bookstore usually has this read included in its select cache. So after seeing it so many times, I decided to give it a read. wow. Talk about juvenile. Perhaps, that is what this is: Juvenile fiction that should be placed with the teenage titles--the Young Adult section, but it's considered serious spiritual fiction. I found it laughable for all the wrong reasons. Cliche upon cliche. I almost winced at certain parts, embarrassed for the author--who is probably not embarrassed at all--as he must be making money hand over fist with such shallow fare. What can I say? Romance fiction sells well,too.If you're looking for pap, pulpy, sugary feel good, gook, this read's for you."
5,Awesome book!!,Wonderful story of adventure and growth. It touched me deeply and I felt the power with which the author wrote this parable. It has great meaning to those who are seeking the road to their higher selves. Thanks Paulo Coelho for this wonderful book.
5,Loved It,Very simple story but very insightful...I will read it again! I am surprised I missed this 10 years ago but very glad I caught it on its anniversary.
2,trite but short.,"Thankfully, this book considers itself a 'fable' and not a novel. It reads much like one of those cliched self help manuals we often see in bargin bins at book stores, full of buzz phrases and meaningless cheery advice. The premise of the story is stolen from a '1001 Arabian Nights' tale and the characters come off more like mouth peices for the author than actual characters, but after all it is just a fable. There are a few plus sides to 'The Alchemest'at least. You don't have to agree with everything the author says, but, if anything, this story will at least get you to think. It's a short read too. It's the type of book I'd recommend only if you have a long bus, train, or plane ride, with little to do."
5,This book is not for all.,"It's obvious that this book is not for everyone (especially the psychotherapist). I have not finished the book yet, but it has already givin me some insight to my own happyness. Like everything else in life we must take it with a grain of salt. I believe that in our society we are programmed and pressured to live within a certain lifestyle. Dress accordingly, eat the same foods, watch the same shows and pay for an education you could get from the public library. This book is about abandoning societies expectations and descovering ourselves. Finding the little omens in life to help guide ourselves to our own happyness. Not what we are supposed to do according to a few experts here and there. Tap into your heart and feel your youth. How many people burn out in there jobs and lives. The point of the book is to do what makes YOU happy. Not what society expects you to do."
5,Do yooh really like this book as much as i do?,"wow is almost all yooh have to say about it!! i had to read this book for a summer reading project and the title at first seemed a bit dull. and now i think this book is the best book i ever read!! it impacted me so much and my friends are awed by it. this i think is meant for people of all ages. especially the people in high skool and college. they need this kind of ""push"" to make life touching decisions."
5,Excellent,"Life's lessons taught so simply, yet so profoundly. An excellent and amazing read, a great reference material. I consider this a very worthy investment."
2,The book was a okay one and the cover is gross.,The cover had a naked angel on it what is with that! Otherwise the book was okay but it was to predictable. It needed a better plot. The main charactor should have gone back to the girl and had some kids. He should also gone back to see his father.
1,Trite,"I had never heard of this book when I bought it at the airport. After the first fifty pages I was hoping for a ""Siddhartha"" but it ended up being a ""Celestine Prophecy."" In other words, instead of simply yet beautifully written and a great piece of literature, it was trite and poorly written with a cheesy new-age plot. Ok for kids but any adult who is a fan should look up Herman Hesse and step it up about 10 levels."
1,ONE OF THE WORST BOOKS OF THE CENTURY,"This book is so full of clichés that i wont waste time talking about it. If you like proust, shakespeare, thomas mann, dante or even somerset maughan dont read it. this is not literature but a vulgar kind of religion."
1,Too much hype II,"Yes, I have to agree with the review entitled ""Too Much Hype"". If you are a careful and thoughtful reader who appreciates literary style and creative, artful expression through writing, you'll likely be disappointed with this book--as I was.The writing style is disjointed and hard to follow, although it is written at a jr. high school or high school level. It is truly amazing to me that this person is a best selling author. A real credit to marketing, packaging and understanding the mystery of what will satisfy the hunger of the masses. Who knows, maybe it was just his 'Personal Legend'. After reading this book, I thought even I could do it......To be fair, the author did include some insights (albeit fairly commonplace) towards the end of his story. But I always appreciate being reminded of those kinds of things..and since I spent the time and money, I had to choose to get something out of it."
1,insipid nonsense,"What a lot of utter overblown empty nonsense. The very story is stolen from a well-known folktale (""The Treasure""); the characters are mere game pieces with absolutely no intellect or emotion (particularly the woman, who has no qualities except that she is beautiful, which we're supposed to assume is enough --blech!); the only quality of suspense is created by the author's failure to explain anything in ways that can be understood by curious, intelligent, thinking readers; and the writing is just abominably bad! What do people see in this book??? Is there such craving out there for spirituality that this insipid fluff is even acceptable? Please look eslewhere for guidance on life; you'll find it in any novel worth it's paper. I'd give it no stars at all, if Amazon allowed that."
2,How about a little reality testing?,"This book came to me highly recommended by an Argentinian friend. What a disappointment. Half way through I thought, ""Oh no! Another Jonathan Livingston Seagull!"" I loathed JLS. I have trouble with books that espouse everything is possible and life doesn't involve compromises and choices. Romantic love is experienced instanteously. Within 5 minutes the main character is ready to commit his entire life to a woman he has just met. She is so detached that she allows him to leave forever while claiming she will love him passionately til her death. Follow your dream and only good things will happen. What pap!"
3,Fool's Gold,"Curious about the buzz this book has generated, I picked it up, prepared to be inspired. I wasn't. It's a nice little fable -- one that you could even read to your kids -- but I didn't find in it any wisdom for the ages. Here's the basic message: ""Trust your intuition. Follow your dreams."" Heard it before? Yeah, I thought so.There really aren't any deep thoughts in the The Alchemist. It's basically a kind of New Age fairy tale. It exhorts you to think big but doesn't really make you think too much. Some have compared it to Kahlil Gibran's The Prophet. Not even close. That thin volume makes you stop every few sentences to ponder its wisdom. It's not much of a story but it's definitely deep. The Alchemist is exactly the opposite: an endearing little story but no great strain on the intellect.Maybe it will cheer you up. Maybe it will give you the encouragement you need to chase your dream. If so, you probably didn't need much of a boost in the first place."
2,The king's invisible clothes syndrome?,"After reading all the hype I ploughed through this undemanding little tale searching for the hidden depths. I left unsatisfied. Sorry folks but there is no profound wisdom here! There is a pleasant enough simple story, but let's not kid ourselves that the secret of life lies therein! Try Voltaire's Candide instead."
1,"Omens here, omens there, omens everywhere.","In this childish fable our young hero learns to speak with his heart (also with the wind, with the sand, and with the sun), and meets magicians and alchemists, who teach him that if he follows his dream (i.e. his personal legend) then all the world will conspire to help him. Most importantly he learns to read the universal language written in omens that guide him along his way. Books are not really helpful for him; at the beginning he is reading one (and using it as a pillow), but once the quest starts he stops reading altogether. A fellow traveler who reads a lot is subtly made fun of, and is left behind.Well, I see precious little wisdom in all of this. Of course you should follow your dreams, but to believe in omens as a guide, or that if you really want to realize your dream then the world will conspire to help you, is simply nonsense. This book is not about wisdom, it is about superstition..."
1,"witless, unoriginal allegory that has somehow duped everyone","this book is ghastly!i really can't understand the fuss about this and can only assume that people are going around hailing it as something important, a publishing phenomenon etc etc simply because they feel they should. the old man santiago meets in spain comments on an irritating book the shepherd is reading-irritating because it says that '...everyone believes the world's greatest lie.'well, my friends, you all seem to believe the world's second greatest lie-i.e. that this is a decent book.it's allegorical nonsense the imagination and insight of which both pale in comparsion to some simple fairy tales. i think that the sycophantic followers of this dross really need to get out more-read joseph conrad or something-challenge yourselves-find a better destiny!"
1,Very Confusing Text!!!,"I'm in an eighth grade honors class, and had to read this book for an assignment. Unfortunately, I found the book vey boring and extremely hard to understand. The text was very confusing, with all the different lessons, all being learned at the same time. I do not recommend this book to anyone under 16."
2,Bland and unoriginal,"I found the book very bland and unoriginal. The plot is similar to old fairy tales, and the ideas are very shallow philosophy."
2,Inspired by ancient oriental tales,"I read the book of The Alchemist,the story is interesting andinspiring, but sadly, the end is the same of an ancient arab story that I read when I was in elementary school, an arabian fable called ""The story of two men who dreamed"", a fable of Arabian Nights.Also, the argentine author Jorge Luis Borges wrotea tale based in that story.I expected for a different and original end of an interesting and a best seller book.I think that the author should give some credit to the surce of his tales."
4,A simple tale that moves your soul,"A very readable book.The illustrated form was especially good because the drawings helped bring out the story even more.A good gift for anyone. Pablo uses a very simple story to speak to our soul and that should prompt us to follow out dreams. If we don't,then it'll be just a dream. Very readable and simply enjoyable."
1,Bad Book,"Personally, I don't really like this book, Santiago's personal legend is to find treasure and live a happy life. BORING!!! That is not a great personal legend, I think it doesn't really count. I think personal legends would be more like, getting a job you love, and making lots of money with it.I don't think I have a favorite part in this book, but I do have a least favorite. I did not like it when Santiago read the flight of the hawks. People should not know what is to come in the future, it could devastate them forever, until the thing happened. They would always be thinking about it. I have read many hundreds of books, and this would not be a book that I would recommend to people."
3,fabalist fantasy fluff,"It's a sweet story -- While there are some charming and encouraging ideas --- The Magical Mystery Tour component leaves one longing for majic carpets,philosopher's stone, Samanthas majical powers, Merlin's Sight, Santa Clause, the Easter Bunny and the Tooth Fairy... Compared to this - Jonathan Livingston Seagull was pretty down to EarthJust think Happy Thoughts and you too can fly! Just like Tinkerbell! (However, I suggest vertical takeoff as opposed to jumping off a building....)"
5,GREAT FOR THOSE IN TRANSITION!,This easy reading little book provided sunshine to an otherwise hectic world. Coming home to read something so simple yet so profound was VERY enjoyable.
3,A Christian view of Hindu mysticism,"Alchemical ideas, by association with most similar philosophies, are essentially Hindu mysticism (cosmic idealism); Coelho takes an esoteric Catholic view of this belief system and translates it into a theology of following personal destiny. The story is told simply in a format readable by children, and reveals much in its asides and the metaphors of its characters, but if it has a failing it is that it focuses too much on the individual and too little on the process of nature and thought as a whole. However, for an introduction it is an excellent, easy read that is fun and family-friendly."
2,Everything but The Girl,"This is a nice little read and will be right up your street if you are a fan of Jonathan Livingston Seagull. I was, however, put off by the shallow characters, in particular Fatima. While her lover is busy following his destiny of travel and adventure, her lot is to content herself with household chores on a desert oasis while awaiting his return. As we are repeatedly told, this is her fate as a desert woman and she is only too pleased to live a life in waiting. I don't find this inspirational in the least and I would not pass this book to my 10 year old niece even if it is within her reading ability. Nor would I be keen for any young boys to get a hold of this lest they come to the conclusion that it is the role of all young women to simply sit around for their white knights. Sure it's a cute story - but one that is trite and somewhat thoughtless."
1,The emperor has no clothes,"New Age mumbo jumbo, but a brilliant marketing campaign. Try ""The Old Man And The Sea"" or ""Night"" if you want a well-written, inspirational short novel."
3,Cliff's notes to life,"Just about the only cliche for how to live your life not included in this story is ""wear clean underwear in case you get in an accident...""Dull writing style, I really don't think this is a case of poor translation, with a disappointing ending.I give it three stars for the thought provoking addition to the legend of Echo and Narcissus in the prologue. If you must, then read the prologue, open up your mind, and work your way through it."
1,A Poor Excuse for a Writer,"As a professor of literature - and I may add a constant student of this wonderful world -I must say that the Alchemist's contribution to the literary world is NONE. The amount of readers who have read this book is absurd. This shows - alarmingly - how people don't have even a basic critical thought and are poorly read. I even read it in portuguese - which I'm fluent - and it didn't improve my opinion of the ""novel"".Ps. Spanish and Portuguese are my mother tongue, English is just my second language so I apologize in advance for any mistakes."
1,"sanctimonious platitude, simplistic parable","Imagine Joel Osteen trying to be Hermann Hesse, and you will have a fairly good concept of this novel.Whatever in this book is not sanctimonious platitude is simplistic parable. Read Siddhartha instead - Hesse understood suffering, as opposed to Coelho, who denies its existence:""My heart is afraid that it will have to suffer,"" the boy told the alchemist one night as they looked up at the moonless sky. ""Tell your heart that the fear of suffering is worse than the suffering itself. And that no heart has ever suffered when it goes in search of its dreams.""That this gibberish is presented with an error of tenses - it should read ""...has ever suffered when it [has gone]..."" just sums it all up."
1,"""Wish it. Want it. Do it.""","I read this book after hearing countless reviews about its amazing and even life-changing qualities. However, what I found between the covers was nothing more than a poorly constructed plot with highly superficial characters, and buckets of dime-store philosophy and ""wisdom"" dumped over the top.lines of wisdom include such commonsense bull as: ""if you want something in life, do it."" (paraphrasing)In all it seemed like Brian's joke book, on Family Guy, ""Wish it. Want it. Do it;"" nothing more than poorly written self-help crap to cater to the oblivious masses of sheep."
1,"Trivial, simplistic, sophomoric but at least it's fast & easy","I cannot fathom what anyone sees in this book. It's strewn with adolescent moral and ethical challenges, two-dimensional characters, and an ending that makes it clear the author had no idea where he was going. For those who gave this five stars, how would you rate ""One Hundred Years of Solitude"" or ""Fifth Business"" or countless other novels with extraordinary depth that challenge the reader at every turn?"
3,worried,"I have not received the book as yet. You sent it to the wrong address.Also, I have not heard from the sender.{Please helpbarbara bou-sliman4899 rustic oaks circlenaples florida 34105"
4,Great simple book,"I enjoyed this book though with all of the hype, honestly was a bit underwhelmed. I will read more from the author though and give his other books a try."
4,An eye opener,"In my search for the universal truth of the universe an my own believes, i bumped in to The Alchemist. I was inspired, thrilled, and most of all it was a great ""eye opener"" for me, as the story, which was brilliant written, tuched som subjects of nature that spoke to me.I can highly recommend reading this book, and use it as a step on the ladder to Alchemy :-)"
3,Mildly entertaining,"Mildly entertaining, read it because it was highly recommended elsewhere. A little too cheesy for me. All I can say is the universe is conspiring but not toward our success! Enjoy."
2,Any longer and I would have given it just one star...,"The book's saving grace is it's length. Any longer, and the simplistic prose, overwrought symbolism, and unbelievable story would have overwhelmed. A good idea for a book, poorly executed.If you're looking for inspirational stories with poetic prose, powerful philosophy, and real characters, try Richard Bach."
3,A gentle reminder to follow your dreams...,"This book was a good little book because it could have delivered the same message by taking us on a journey from New York to California, but it didn't... it took us from Spain to Egypt and that is what makes it enjoyable. The charm comes from the gypsies, dessert dwellers, kings, even Santiago's relationship with his sheep. As so many books we've all read before, this fast read reminds us to follow your dreams, follow your heart, and ""don't give in to your fears,"" in a simple succinct fashion.""Tell your heart that the fear of suffering is worse than the suffering itself."" - Paolo Coelho, The Alchemist"
1,I don't get the praise for this book,"It is a easy read with a somewhat interesting story. That's about as much as I can say for the good of it. The whole thing is basically built around the idea that if you think positive thoughts and really try hard, then the universe or God or fate or some kind of generic force will help make sure you get it. Personally, I think that is a really dumb idea (I'm all for religious belief, just not for the pop psychology positivism that people call spirituality these days).Even if you are in to that, I would image there are books out there with more compelling stories worked in. You'd be better off spending your time reading something else."
1,Worst YA book I have ever read,"I am really mystified by the spectacular reviews for this novel. I read it in my Young Adult literature class in college, and was absolutely stunned at how horrible it was. The characters were hollow archetypes and the plot was as hackneyed as they come. A coming of age story with absolutely no originality or character appeal. What's worse is that the author is constantly beating you over the head with his message. Maybe teenagers these days don't understand the point of a novel without it being shouted at them from every paragraph, but I found it obnoxious. Also, the ideas represented in the novel are borrowed from Eastern philosophy (particularly Zen Buddhism and Taoism), but are not very well explained. The only reason I understood the concepts was because I had a course on Taoism. I really wish I could reclaim the couple of hours of my life I wasted reading this book."
1,Hated it.,"If it wasn't so short I would have stop about 50 pages into it, but I was curious to see what the point was. Unfortunately, it wasn't worth the time. If you are over 10 years old this book should not have much effect on you. It makes me sad that anyone would be influenced by something so trivial and slight.Read it at you own risk."
2,Hardly the modern-day Little Prince,"The author starts with a nice premise, but unfortunately there's not much plot development happening. All the ideas are carefully explained in a four-page prologue, which makes the book itself redundant. I read on and on, waiting for a revelation, but nothing happened. The writing style was so unbearably didactic that it might as well have been one of those horrible self-help books which seem to be so en vogue these days. Nice try at creating a new classic, but this book is really just a fad."
1,Oh Please!,"It is hard to imagine that a book this shallow could become a best seller. With the wealth of fine, complex and challenging books one could read to spark contemplation about one's life path, why would any adult choose this one? I forced myself to finish it out of loyalty to my book club, but like several others we've been ""conned"" into reading by clueless reviewers (The Five People You Meet in Heaven, the Four Agreements) it is at its core a quick buck book. Apparently, if you repackage any simple truism you heard from Grandma in the nursery, you can rake in many dollars from the gullible. I am just glad I followed my heart and got the book from the library. I'll give the money saved to a good cause as part of my path to my personal legend."
3,The Achemist,Very simple. Like a fairy tale. Good life lessons. The Post office crushed it. It should have been shipped in a box. It is a quick read.
2,"Ehhh, not what I hoped for...","Maybe I was hoping for some great, philosophical ""Aha"" moment when I read ""The Alchemist"" but I didn't. It nearly lulled me to sleep. Maybe I had too high of expectations or not, either ways, ""The Alchemist"" did have the ""WOW"" factor for me. I was initially going to give this only one star but I decided to bump it up because the concept was there but the writing wasn't.I am a little irritated that I lost 2 1/2 hours of my life that I can not get back."
2,Alchemist - over my head,"The Alchemist is the tale of a shepherd boy who travels to Egypt in search of his Personal Legend. It's entertaining and provides interesting views on life that are worth pondering and discussing, but overall it struck me more as a spirituality/self-help book than a novel. And as with the few books I've read in this genre, like the Celestine Prophecy, I was left feeling I'd missed most of the metaphors and hidden messages within its pages. But I'm not particularly good at reading books that require analysis - I read for escapism and entertainment and I like rushing through the rollercoaster ride that most novels provide. So I'm probably not the most qualified person to review The Alchemist - but it is critically acclaimed and has apparently resonated with many readers around the world."
5,Truth about life,This book explains so many ordinary things that we encounter and not think about day to day. There's so many hidden truth in the book and deep philosophical concept that we don't usually think about. This book reminds us to follow our dreams no matter how hard it is to do so. It's a short book and an easy read. It's not meant for people to read it superficially. GREAT BOOK! BUY IT! READ IT! LOVE IT!
1,Ugh. . .,"This is a terrible, childish, turd of a book. I'm incensed that another adult human recommended this puerile garbage to me. Seriously, it's like Oprah, Dr. Phil, and Depak Chopra took a collective dump, named it Paulo Coelho, taught it to write, and then unleashed it on the world to spread its new-agey nonsense. The world is a little colder, and a little more dead because this man is alive and writing in it."
2,A disappointment,"I have heard people raving about this book for a long time, so when I received it for Christmas last year, I was excited to begin reading it. Unfortunately, however, it wasn't as good as I anticipated. The book is an allegory about a boy-Shepherd who is on a search for his ""personal legend"" in the desert. On his way he meets an assortment of people, including an alchemist, who help him on his journey to find his destiny. The concept of the story is interesting and there are a few touching and inspiring bits, but other than that, I found it cheesy and a little too heavy on the religion."
2,Boring,This is a simple story that seems to have been written as a child's book. The story and characters are never well developed. I can't imagine how it has sold so many copies.
3,A Good book,A Good book and a Good Read. Seems to cut off for the ending as it leaves out the rest of the story. Not as inspiring as I had expected but overall a good book.
5,The Alchemist,"Reviewer: Maria Arellano from Montebbello Adult School,Montebello, C.A. This wonderful story wrote by Paulo Coelho show us the ways and many possitive messages to continue fight in our life, with faith, love, and courage."
3,Nice and Uplifting ... but so-so,"It has a nice underlying message. But the story isn't very moving. And it wasn't in any way a ""page-turner."" Thankfully it was an easy read and fairly short."
5,THIS IS ONE OF THE GREATEST BOOKS EVER!,"Let's see...What can I say about this book? It is one of the greatest books ever written. This truly takes you back to bare minimum thinking in a profound, let's-ponder-the-meaning-of-life way. After I read this book, I saw everything in a whole new light!"
2,Try it in Spanish...,"I've read several of Paulo Coelho's works and have found each to be incredible, in particular The Alchemist. However, I must point out that I have done so in Spanish, which closely resembles Portugese, Coelho's native language. Out of curiosity I began to read The Alchemist in its English translation and found it to be too sachrine and at times even dull. Needlsess to say, I did't get very far into the English version before putting it down.If at all possible, I'd recomend to those who can to read The Alchemist in Spanish (a sophisticated knowledge of the Spanish language is not necesary; the vocabulary is quite simple). The two-star rating refers to the English translation: Otherwise, this book would easily earn five stars."
1,waste of time,"This is probably one of the most hyped-up books history. It's neither inspiring nor entertaining. Language of the World, Soul of the World, Omen, Destiny that's all what you get to read - repeatedly. The protagonist can talk to Desert, Wind and Sun and becomes wind himself. There is hardly any story and lot of preacher talk. The only impact it had on me was that I fell asleep every time I tried to finish it."
3,Cliche ridden super- sentimental piece,I know this book is a worldwide bestseller and has received praise of the highest kind from very distinguished and knowledgable people. Yet I found it extremely boring and difficult to read. The whole story sounded to me phony. The whole business about 'pursuing one's own legend' seemed to me simplistic. The 'wisdom' which emerged in the course of all the hero's wanderings seem to me little more than cliche. I could not understand how so many people went for this book. Here it is important to note that the overwhelming majority of its readers disagree with me completely.
1,Don't waste your money,"I was recommended this book by an acquaintance who claimed that this book changed his life. Curious as to what all the fuss was about, I bought a copy and read it. This book is the most over-rated garbage I have ever had the misfortune to waste good money on. The ""fable"" is banal and shallow and I cannot for the life of me figure out why anyone would consider reading this trash a life changing endeavour. Don't do as I did and waste your money on this book!"
3,Okay but not my type of book,"I am glad I read it so I know what his writing is like, but it is not really my kind of book. I think however that teenagers would like it. maybe it will appeal to their sense of adventure."
3,philosophical,"The story is alright, it has some lovely quotes and meaningful lines in amongst the story, but it was very hard for me to get into and enjoy the characters."
2,Still Searching.....,"When you are told of a book that may harbour lights for your heart & give feelings of inspiration that answers are close by, I couldn't wait to read this book. Having got the book, then having read the book, I could have told him at the beginning not to move. For me, I'm still searching....This book is totally overrated."
3,Saccharine and easy,"This book will be a must-read for anyone who loves self-help, for anyone who fell over themselves reading Bridges of Madison County, who were shocked and awed by the DaVinci Code, who slavered over the Celestine Prophecy. The more faith you have, the more you'll love this book. The more you want to believe, the more you will believe this book has changed your life. It's a quick and easy read, and so why not?"
1,The Alchemist,This book read like it was written for a child. The story was very simplistic and the so called inspirational message was obvious from the beginning. I had a hard time even finishing the book.
2,Good read for a Fourth Grader,"For morality tales with more wit and sophistication read The Decameron and One Thousand and One Nights (unabridged). For much better fables that make you think and feel, read The Pearl by John Steinbeck and The Old Man and the Sea. The best thing about this book was that it was short so it did not waste much of my time. I cannot recommend this book for any serious reader."
4,amazing journey story,"this is story about journey of pursuing dream. i give this book 4 stars because it is very inspiring, the story teaches us to have courage following our dreams. the story is well written, simple and fun to read. this is a kind of book that is good to accompany you when you are in journey"
4,Takes you to another world....,"This little gem of a book transforms you back in time as you set out on a journey with the little shepard to find his treasure. It's and inspiring, cute book that I coudln't put down. The book is written in a way that makes you reflect on your own life throughout it. I would recommend this book to anyone!"
2,heavy-handed parable,I like a little more subtlety in my philosophy of life. And why is it that the woman is always waiting for the man to return from his adventuring?? What happened to her seeking her own personal legend? We have them too!
5,Great read!!,Awesome book! Loved it! I was glued to the book for 2 days straight and it really made me think about my own personal journey and things that happen along the way.
2,not my style,"Didnt it like this book, got half way through it and ive thrown it aside. Boring and predictabe. Perhaps if i was 10 id fancy it."
2,Bordering on Cliche,"I'm not going to say that I don't understand the positive reviews here, because I do. This book is inspiring in the same way that a sunrise is, and that is a way that's been pointed out every day since the beginning of time.I found this book to be a culmination of all the cheesy, so-called-encouraging ""what's-meant-to-be"" quotes that any distant friend gives you when you're stressed out.As a book, I found it to be average. I was able to finish it easily, but the message was dragged. The final scene was exciting and written well, but the message was too Aesop for me.A friend recommended it to me saying that it ""changed her life."" It certainly didn't change mine, and if it changes yours... I think you've been living under a rock for a while."
3,overrated adventure,nice good adventure and self realization story. symbolisms abound but it is not a life changing book. overrated. like many of the booker prize winners.
4,A must read and re-read,"Just read this book, The Alchemist, for the second time. The first time was about 18 years ago while living in Portugal. It is even better the second time around. I highly recommend it. Read closely every line and think about what that line is teaching you!"
3,Simple story about finding your treasure,"It is a story about a shepherd that is pretty happy with his life. He then meets a couple of people who tell him to go seek a treasure in Egypt. Along the way he learns about life and the ups and downs. There are a lot of quotes of wisdom, omens and religious tones. I have always heard you have to read it. So I read it, the ending was the worth reading the whole book. It is short and simply written."
3,A good children's book,"I found this book through the reviews of the Celestine Prophesy, A couple of people recommended this book as a much better alternative. I have read both books, and I can say without a doubt that I enjoyed CP much more. The Alchemist is a children's book. A simple little story, with VERY little content which could require thought. I would recommend it to any 3'rd grader, but if you are much older, skip it"
1,The Alchemist: A Fable About Following Your Dream,"Why does Amazon gouge customers for charging $3.53 more for a Kindle copy than the cost of a paperback? The paperback must be sent up electronicaly to print. This is a no Brainer or is Amazon following in the steps of Apple , the I-POD and the three book publishers to increase the prices?"
1,Worst book I ever had to read,"I would give this book NO stars, but that's not a selection. I would never have finished it, except my book club selected it. Actually, I wouldn't have even opened it after reading the book jacket--flowery fables of realizing your dreams are not my cup of tea."
1,"Sick, morally depraved garbage","I find trash like ""The Alchemist"" to be guilty as the impetus of social decreptitude in the modern world. I do not find it difficult to malign a book that advocates utter greed and contempt for life and that does so with a 100 page heap of cliched crap. A novel that lauds the choice to leave loved ones in search of personal, monetary gain, ""The Alchemist"" left with me with a sick feeling in the pit of my stomach."
1,The Anti-Candide,"I picked up this book with an open mind, wondering what all the hype was about. It turns out it's all about hype. This is not literature; it's a string of trite self-improvement bromides.Of all the gushy blurbs on the cover, the most outrageous is the one that compares it to Voltaire's Candide. It may be a story about a quest, but there the similarity ends. Lovers of Candide should imagine that book, stripped of all its nuance and narrative richness, and populated by stick figures who ponderously (and repetitively!) intone Big Thoughts. And in the end, those thoughts wind up being nothing more than that this IS the best of all possible worlds, in which anyone with pluck and determination can go to El Dorado, become fabulously rich, and then head back to Westphalia, secure in the knowledge that Cunegonde will be waiting faithfully. Some may find this fluff uplifting, but I'm going back to Voltaire."
1,A waste of time,"I found this author to be very self-righteous and preachy. The book has little to no action, and has a simple story line that could have been written by a child. Overall the book is cheesy and just plain lame. Take my advise and read something a little more clever than your typical, ""follow your dream, listen to your heart"" kind of book."
5,A most consuming story of a shepherd boy on search,"Not often do you discover a goldmine in the simple story of a Shepherd boy. Santiago is seeking his Personal Legend to find his destiny in the Language of the World and in his heart of love. Traveling from Andalusia and beloved, Fatima, meeting the King of Salem, the Englishman, finally the mystic, Alchemist, he learns to turn himself into the wind, overcoming his fears of an African desert and those distant Pyramids of Egypt he discovers his Treasure! In discovering his treasure he loses his fears, learns things along the way he would have never discovered without following his dreams!An enchanting, yet slowly paced read, for fear of missing some details along the way...Retired Chaplain, Fred W Hood"
2,spiritual hogwash,"I was expecting more from this book. Unfortunately, it did not deliver. The author borrows heavily from earlier writings, showing little in the way of true originality or creativity. His ideas seem simplistic and shallow (e.g., Personal Legend), while the repetetiveness of certain words like ""omen"" and phrases (e.g., Language of the World)are laughable. Worse, he seems to believe that ""when a person really desires something, all the universe conspires to help him get it."" What nonsense! On the plus side the story was somewhat interesting. However, the central ideas are simply not seminal and to be perfectly blunt, the book seemed amateurish.If you are looking for a great spiritual book written by a true master, read Journey to Ixtland by Carlos Castenda. His other books are almost as good. Hermann Hesse is another terrific writer with something important and original to say.Enjoy!!"
2,Move on,"I had heard that this book was a really good read, but I had to struggle through it. It's translated into English so that makes it a little more difficult to read. It was a little more black and white that I was expecting. I felt this, this happened...things like that. Not pondering really and why things were the way they were. I would not read it again and I wouldn't lend it out to anyone telling them it is worth their time."
1,What's all the fuss about?,I was so disappointed when I finally read this book. After hearing of it for so long I bought it and was utterly bored with it. I kept waiting for it to go somewhere but it never did. I should have known when in the intro page the author or publishers resort to celebrity namedropping in order to entice the reader. This is an old story told long ago with the same themes in children's fairy tails. I gave it to my 10 year old son who liked it but did not love it. This book is for people who are into spirituality and the self absorbed who expect a book to change their life.
4,Nice little read,"The theme is simple, follow your heart and let it take you where you need to go. Not to sure about some of the other reviews calling it sexist???? Little too Catholic???? (He spends most of his time in Muslim north Africa!) But erm..... each to there own. I guess if you want sexist conspiracies then you can find them anywhere even in an innocent novel!A simple enough story a journey initially in search of gold that finally concludes at finding what he was really looking for, himself.If you want a pleasant little read to take with you this summer on holiday, this is it."
2,Insidiously insipid,"Though prettied up in an appealingly innocuous package, this story of a young boy's journey to find his ""treasure"" is a rather insidious form of propaganda for a particular and particularly inimical point of view. The New Age myth of the personal dream which must be pursued in order to fulfill one's destiny is custom-made to instill dissatisfaction in the average person trying to find joy and fulfillment in life's every-day normality. The risk of such an approach is that those foolish enough to follow it without extreme caution may well abandon those things which will indeed give true happiness in favor of the pursuit of some pipedream which never will. The fragile psyche will be particularly vulnerable to such influence. We make a grave mistake if we believe that literature cannot be such a powerful force; it can be and is. I would not recommend this book to anyone."
2,Nothing new,The premise of this book is simple and often repeated -- follow the urging of Spirit and life will open in magical ways. A nice little re-telling of this theme but very Catholic Church in its message that men (only) would have wonderful spiritual adventures if only women didn't hold them back. Not worth reading except as an introduction to the world of following your intuition.
4,Book,"Read only if you are interested in your inner life or are in search of the meaning of life. I loved it, but some friends did not."
5,It was sooo cute,"The Alchemist was probably one of the cutest fictional books I've ever read, along with Ella Enchanted. The ending will surprise you and the entire story you won't be able to put the book down. I really loved the book and I think everyone should read it atleast once."
1,Was expecting so much more,"The author does create a nice picture with the words, but it is filled with far too much unnecessary drivel. There is a book that I read when I was a boy, and it is still one of my favorites as an adult. Written by Uri Shelevitz, ""The Treasure"" is basically the same story (without the love interest and the Personal Legend garbage). I suggest saving the hours you might read this book and check out ""The Treasure"" at your local library. It will only take you about 5 minutes to read."
2,Disappointing and overly simplistic,"Upon hearing my friends' raves about this book, I bought it with high hopes. Some even compared it to Hesse's Siddhartha, a classic text. Unfortunately, the book doesn't measure up to any literary standard outside an elementary school context. What is supposed to be a philosophical journey of self-discovery is better described as a trite, overly simplistic, and predictable waste of time. The only saving grace is that the story does build some suspense toward the end, but of course this is completely rotted away when the ridiculous ending is finally revealed, leaving the reader with a longing bad taste in the mouth.N."
3,IT is a good book but ...,"This book is good, if not a little simple. Unfortunatly I do not think that the content is that origianl. The whole ""force"" thing and following your destiny seems to be off of star wars. Then the book seems a bit cheesy at times. How come 90 percent of the characters the kid meets know about this destiny, meaning of the universe stuff. The kid also is too perfect. He soes not make a mistake throughout the book. It seems to me the characters are not the best I have seen. The book seems a bit weighed down in self help jargon. Many of the dialogues and thought traks make it seem like only a self help book. I do not mean to sound too negative, the book is not bad and it does bring a sense of magic and intrigue to some of its mystical characters that makes it worth reading. This book does not seem to be letting you figure out its meaning, it shoves it down your throat much of the time, still it is not a bad book."
1,If you really want to use your brain avoid this book.,"he doesn't challenge the reader to think.Reading Alchemist, it like reading Spiderman comic book but of course with Spiderman being much better.Superman has more philosophy than any book of Paulo Coelho,and I bet he has a collection of Superman at home.A book have to have a historic context with solid foundation and if it wants to be good have to have a central basic idea that it will lead the destiny and behavior of the characters independent of the happy end. If you really wants a good book read Time and the Wind by Erico Verissimo this that call a excellent book from a excellent writter."
5,Good to read,I have read lot of books which teachs us values. And lot of novels too. But this is a two-in-one. I like the way the author takes us through the story. It has lot of important lessons to life. When i read stories based on mythology i tend to get a bit sober. But this time i felt i was on cloud 9. A must read.
5,Follow your Heart!,"The Alchemist by Paulo CoelhoAnother inspiring and uplifting fable type story about a young man following his dreams. A country boy becomes a shepherd because he wants to travel and see new places in the countryside of Andalusia. Then he dreams of riches to be found in the Pyramids of Egypt.All the while the book makes the reader think about many ideas or seeds of success. There must have been 25 positive seeds or ideas that are worth writing down as you come across them.When I read a book that I truly enjoy and it mentions another book I always jot it down and pick it up. This often sets up a chain of events that leads to one great book after another. Sometimes the chain goes 3,4 or even 5 books deep. I ended up at the Alchemist this way. It started out like this:Berkshire Hathaway's letter to shareholders by Warren BuffettthenThe Smartest Guys in the RoomthenThe Fountainhead and the AlchemistGlad I ended up here!(...)"
4,Good Work,"This is a little beauty. A great work from the Brazilian author. After finishing the book we might ask ourselves `don't we also see omens around us?' Though it is not just a `love story', we can feel the deep love between Santiago and Fatima. Yes, it is the universal language....worth reading but let me tell you one thing, this is not for those `realistic' people, and one should be imaginative to enjoy the book."
3,Not bad...Not good,"Coelho offers a fairly conventional fable with this one: follow your heart, the universe provides, God is everywhere, you hold the key to your own destiny, etc... This fable is couched in the language of Alchemy (which is admirable...it is obvious that Paolo has studied Blake and a few of the major alchemical texts), and it accurately portrays two of the major world religions, but the main charcter is a far, far cry from a hero, and the thrown in love story would have been better left out. If you want to feel good about yourself for a little while, not a bad book. If you want to understand the cosmos in its myriad manifestations, this book does not deliver. Pure fantasy. You'd be better off reading Rand."
3,a childrens book,i found the book very simple and not interesting.the story is very simple and all that fake nonsenss about reaching your destination makes it not worth reading.the only good thing about it is that its fast and easy.if your looking for good reading read m.bulgakov's books
5,wonderful,"This book was wonderful. It was a really quick read, and I enjoyed the whole thing. It was a compelling story that was told simply and beautifully. I would definitely recommend it!"
3,A perfect Philosophical Story,"This is a perfect philospphical story. Though initial grip is excellent, it makes an end beyond imagination. Main character faces some hypothetical incidents in the later part of the story and the story suddenly turns out to be fantasy."
2,too simple,"this book is just too simple. i can't get into all the detail that other reviewers, because it was done well already. i find it interesting that the woman's dream was just to have a man delivered to her from the desert, and she knew it her role to wait for him to find his dream and support him with that. since, of course, her dream was already fulfilled by him."
1,garbage,"go out and rent the movie ""wizard of oz"" and forget even bothering with this load of garbage. Yah yah yah go home and see your home has been paved for a walmart and your gal is for rent at 20$ an hour. If this guy cant come up with something more profound than ""there is no place like home"" waste your hard earnd $$ elseware"
2,fable foibles,"I would have to say the only thing preventing this from a 1 star ranking from me is that the overall message is rather harmless. Unfortunately the writing style may cause headaches and eyestrain. It's very repetitive and inelegant, and very self-aware. the story is VERY religious, and very predictable. I think the biggest problem I had with this book is that it is a modern attempt at an ancient style. What makes fables and ancient text appealing to me is the connectedness I feel with people and places that are centuries old. This is nothing more than a hijacking of the fable mechanism transformed to modern new-age fluff. I'd suggest it for kids, but I think most adults will find themselves rolling their eyes at the heavy handed cliche's found in this highly overrated beach book"
3,"Enjoyable, but...","When this book first came out, I was 15 and if I had read it then, it would have been a more life-altering experience for me. But it was only recently that a friend of mine recommended The Alchemist to me, which is kind of unfortunate. I did enjoy reading it, and it was lovely, simple prose. But I noticed that Coelho pretty much bases the book on an old Norwich myth, ""The Pedlar of Swaffham."" The reason I'm giving it 3 stars is because he's really not saying anything new, and basically rips off of The Little Prince and Siddartha, both of which I feel are much more poignant than this book. If you're at that transition point in your life, this book would be a good catalyst for inspiration and to buy into the cliche of following your dreams. But come on, it's not like I'm 15 anymore."
2,A nice little story but the climax is a rip-off,"A very good friend recommended this book to me as a life-changer. Yeh I could see the value of it, maybe moreso when I read it again. However the night before I finished it I read a story to my kids about a guy named John Chapman, the peddlar of Swaffham, an English legend of sorts from the 15th century. The next night, I finished the alchemist and was pretty disgusted to find that the conclusion was nothing but an exact rip off of the legend. This book's supposed to be a stand-out, and as such you expect quality and moreso, *originality* throughout. Overall its probably a reasonably good read, but in the end I feel completely cheated by such a blatant piece of plagarism."
2,Boring,"I read this book recently, and have to say it is the most boring, dull and confusing book i have ever read. True, you should chase and reach your dreams, but must they be found in such a uninspirational and dull way? There are some interesting concepts but they are also equally confusing. Due to the mass hype and praise of this book, i read it a second time - hoping to grasp something i missed...but i just felt bored and wished i hadnt spent valuable time of my life reading this...maybe this is a revolutionary book for some but i just didn't like or believe in the unrealistic and often at times ridiculous storyline"
5,"Things everyone should, and does, know...","Paulo Coelho is an excellent writer. In the shape of a fable, he teaches his readers things everyone should know - how to listen to your heart and what is the way to be happy and fulfilled. The things he says are so basic that, if he told you them directly, you would not believe him. But the truth is that you already knew it, and he is simply reminding you - poignantly, simply, beautifully, that you should follow your dreams. Highly recommended."
2,Interesting,"I dont get what the deal is with this book. I read it in one sitting. The author repeats himself over and over again, the plot line is simplistic, the characters boring."
1,Definitely not for everyone,"I think this may be the most polarizing book of all time; it seems like everyone gave it either one star or five. When I was 22 (15 years ago) I read ""The Celestine Prophecy"", enjoyed it, and thought a lot about it afterwards. Today I can't believe the younger me got sucked in to such spirtubabble....so something much have changed in me during that time. Did I become jaded and cynical as I got older, or just wiser and more mature?The point is, while I absolutely hated the Alchemist, finding it incredibly boring and staggeringly cheesy, I can't help but wonder if I would have liked it in 1992. But if you are like me (today) and tend to roll your eyes and say ""oh please"" when you read about someone speaking to the sun and turning himself into the wind, then definitely save your money and more importantly, your time."
3,Looking For a Quick School Read,"I was looking for a read that would go very quickly and this was definately it. I was able to read this book in about three hours and I am a slow reader. The content of this book was very easy to follow, but some parts were repetitive and drawn out. Also, there were so many themes and counter ideas presented in this book and this added to the confusion that would have made it a great read. I do not feel like this was one of the greatest contemporary novels of our time and has won awards unjustly. I give it a C+"
4,Good,Love it very good book and I really recommend it to many and all people who can get it! Read and enjoy
2,"Its a parable, understand that before buying","I bought this books with some expectations, so I was disappointed. I should have looked that its listed under, mysticism and self help. I was looking for a great story. I assumed it was fantasy. But this is about as simple and shallow as a story gets. No depth whatsoever to characters. The story is quite simple, know what is your true dream and follow it. If you do that life will help you along.The story advocates listening to your heart, because it speaks to us, and gives us guidance. Often when we fail its because we did not listen to our hearts. To underscore the truthfulness of this, my heart was saying ""Stop reading! This is Dull!!!"" but I did not listen and pretty much had to push through this book, suffering all the way.That said it gives a nice message, although unbelievably simple and personally I feel it should be a childrens book. I figure someone looking for some guidance or inspiration in their lives might get more out of this book."
2,Get rich quick scheme,"I've read a lot of negative reviews about how shallow and childish this book is. But, the worst part for me wasn't just that the boy was following his dream, but that it wasn't even his dream. It was ""interpreted"" for him and sold to him by every character he encountered. This is just like a typical get rich quick scheme except but in real life, there isn't really a chest full of gold at the end."
1,Can I have my two hours back?,"The other 200 one star reviews provide all the adjectives necessary(""aggresively awful"" is my personal favorite). I will just try to find it in my heart to forgive the person who recommended this (add preferred adjective here) book to me."
4,The alchemist,Great I loved this book. It was more than I expected I could've read it in a day or 2 but I wanted the experience 2 last as long as possible
3,A simple tale with a few nuggets of inspiration.,"An easy read with undeveloped characters but stocked with a few nuggets of wisdom and inspiration. Sometimes the simple things are the best. If you're looking for deep esoteric symbolism and mysticism this may not be the book for you. If you like simple messages of facing your fears, applying faith, overcoming obstacles and finding the ""treasure"" that is already around you, then read this book. I'm glad I did."
3,Two Books,I had so much going on that I ended up ordering the same books twice because the second one didn't come for a while. So I just gave this one as a gift.
1,balderdash,this book is dreadful. it is the emperor with no clothes on walking down the street all over again. only gullible people desperate to be mystical could enjoy it. it is a fraud. crap what more do you want me to say. mind your money.
4,A significant but easy read- Well worth the experience,"This work is meant for sharing! It began as a selection in my girlfriend's book club. She read part of it to me while traveling out of town. I immediately finished it early the next morning and proceded to order a copy for myself, my daughter and my brother. It IS that good!Some have compared it to ""Candide"", ""Siddhartha"" and ""Jonathan Livingston Seagull"". I wouldn't go quite that far but for anyone examining their own life, etc. ""The Alchemist"" is a must read along with those other noteable titles. Please- read it. Enjoy it. And, share it!"
5,"Deceptively simple, but simply deep","To paraphrase the Confucian phrase: ""What the superior person seeks is within, what the small person seeks is in others."" Coehlo's parable about a young shepherd's trek to find a great treasure makes that quote the crux of its simple yet profound point.Written in a clear, tight prose that still manages to paint a beautiful epic feel, The Alchemist is a great story to read when you're feeling overwhelmed by it all. A petite book, it's a great traveling companion and a quick read."
5,BETTER THAN WORDS CAN DESCRIBE,"If you haven't read this book yet - PLEASE READ IT!!!!I can only tell you that it is excellent and the story is reallly easy to follow. But you need to come to this book completely unknowing if you can, because it is then such a pleasant surprise and experience that it has to be savoured and enjoyed personally - I cannot stress this enough.BUT PLEASE DO READ IT!!"
5,A wonderful Parable,"There is no question that this book presents a wonderful story....I would say a parable on recognizing ""signs"" or ""omens"" that help guide ones life. It was a terrific read and from a person who has been exposed to many signs of late, reading this book has given me the courage to continue on what my heart feels right. Thanks for an excellent read."
5,genius,So simple and entertaining it is genius. Nearly impossible to put down. I'm bummed I waited so long to read this.
3,Profound or Pablum?,"This book had been recommended to me by a Christian brother whose advice I tend to follow. However, I found the story to be predictable. I know the purpose of the book, however, it vacillated between unfocused, hazy mystical speak and concrete Christian teachings. I will definitely reread it in the near future because it strikes me as the type of book that one can take away different lessons each time it is read."
3,An Interesting Life Philosophy,"In a way this book reminded me of Candide. It was written to speak of a specific philosophy and the entire text seemed to contribute to that. Though it does tell a story of a boy traveling across cities and deserts to find a treasure, at heart it is a story about how we must be true to our own destinies and listen to the land and the signs around us because we are all one.I thought the book to be interesting, and underlined quite a few passages I found to be thought provoking and intriguing. At the same time, the book was simple and at times a little sexist. The characters were flat and I found little significance in the plot itself. What I mean to say, is this book shouldn't be read if you wish to only hear a story. Instead this book is meant to be larger than a succession of events. This book tells of a life philosophy and for that, I think it is worthwhile. I would recommend it."
4,Well written journey,A well written journey that forces us all to contemplate our own journey. Coelho masterfully draws you in and leads you on a journey of the soul.
3,New Age Fable,"Coehlo's prose is simple and eloquent and in the first pages there is a promise of a riveting story about self-discovery. However, it turns out Coehlo's new-age message is old, almost cliche. I kept thinking of the Alchemist as Obi-wan and Santiago as a slightly less annoying Luke Skywalker. I felt the climactic scene was when Santiago ""transformed"" into the wind, but even that reminded me of a children's book.. that one where the little bunny says he'll run away from the mother bunny but she says she'll transform herself into the wind or other elements to find him? So in that way, I found the book beautiful in its simplicity, irritating in its ""spiritual message"" and disappointing as its plot fell flat after Santiago left the crystal shop. Oh well... after all, there is ""nothing new under the sun..."""
5,Fantastic book - everyone should read,"I enjoyed the book from cover to cover and I am now starting to read his next book the Fifth Mountain. It gets you in focus and shows you how to follow your dreams. I will read it several times, I'm sure. I have purchased it for friends and family!"
5,Great reading,I had heard about the book on a TV show and I thought it was worth buying.I am not a great reader and I have never finished reading a book completely but this book I could not put down untill Ihad completely read it from cover to cover..It has changed my way of thinking altogether Paulo is a great writer. It really had me mesmerized and I would say it is the best book I have ever picked up and read. Thanks Paulo. Love and Light. Andy.
4,Great read,I really enjoyed this book. I read it because Will Smith spoke about how it influenced his life. The take away for me is to follow your heart.
3,find your journey!,"This a positive book, which shows us a Boy's journey, in finding his goal in life. This is a simple book, with simple truths...everything is around us, in this world we live in, its just a matter of looking in the right place. You can start by reading this book!"
5,Treasurehouse,Everything we need his hidden in the depths of our inner mansion...brilliantly written with such thirst for the offering each of us must give is our soul in this world but not of it for what other reason are we here but to fulfill our Personal Legend.
4,Inspiring,"Summation: Personal paths and the path to achieving them are not sought by all, you must follow your heart. Loved this book."
5,Great buy!,One of my favorite books. I am very glad that I purchased it. I strongly recommend this book.In great condition.
1,The Alchemist,"The story was ok but it really went nowhere. Going on and on about his ""personal legend"" and the ""soul of the world"" and the ""language of the world"" made me think the author must be on acid or something. Sorry, but unless the author and I are in the same place in our minds, I just don't know what he is talking about and he didn't give me enough information to figure it out. Enough of these mystic books already. It'll probably be made into another bad movie."
4,A Parable,"A parable is an allegory that illustrates a complex point, and that's what The Alchmist does, it illustrates the search for our inner treasure, that which we all seem to look for desperately.I read this novel almost at the same time that I read Grigor Fedan's ""Dream Maker:A Mystical Tale"" and I can't help but compare the two, because they deal with the same topic, the search for our inner self. While The Alchemist is simple in its message and warms the heart, Fedan takes the topic and brings it home in all of its complexity; the search is prompted by a sense of emptiness and the answers that we all crave for are brought to the surface in the narrative. Cohelo's is a fairy tale, Fedan's is a complex metaphysical novel that makes you think.It almost depends what you are in the mood for, but I would definetely recommend for people to read both novels, they complement each other nicely.I am grateful to both authors. I want more novels like these."
1,"""Little Prince"" for Dummies","I hated this book. If you've ever saw only the beginning of a movie, and already knew how it ended, this books reminds you strongly of that. I know that it is a fairy tale, but the unrealistic circumstances that surround this boy's life are at times ridiculous, and even disheartening when you think of real life situations. People, save your money and check out the Little Prince instead. All the important things to learn in life are in that book, and as opposed to The Alchemist, it is not ego-centric. It really bothers me when people equate The Alchemist to the Little Prince. It's more like ""The Little Prince for Dummies."""
2,A Childish Fable,"I thought The Alchemist was a childish fable written for a sixth grader. It didn't have the same adult action scenes as LUMINOUS by Peter Quest. While LUMINOUS shared the same ""Follow Your Dream"" message, it also had several powerful scenes that I'll never forget."
1,Baffled,"I do not get how anyone likes this book at all. It's boring. It's repetitive. It's horridly simple. The characters have no depth. Every character speaks like the next. The dialog is ridiculous. It's full of cliches and platitudes that have a tenuous connection if any at all.I am baffled, BAFFLED that anyone likes this book. There is nothing here. I can possibly see a 13 year old simpy girl finding this deep. Just like a 13 year old simpy girl would find Backstreet Boy's lyrics deep. But how any grown person who has actually lived in any form of reality can find this book to be anything other than drivel blows my mind.I read this for a book club and I am going to smack who ever suggested it."
2,5th grade type book,"This book is short and an easy read. It's a metaphorical and philosophical book, but it seemed to me more like a 5th grade read as it is about a young boy searching for meaning and satisfying his curiosity. He meets new people in different culture. The reader watches as he gains new experiences and insight on life."
5,for open minded readers,"It says right on the cover. A FABLE. It disgusts me how some of you sit there and say it was a fable with no deep meaning. ""after all the hyper I heard on it i read through it in 2 days and there is nothing deep here"". If you can just sit every now and then, with an open mind. Not expecting a deep insight on your lifes meaning, you will enjoy it, i loved this book. If you even knew anything about spiritual awakenings you wouldn't be trying to find it in a book. All you pish posh im to deep and profound for this book, im a true alchemist, get off the computer? what are you doing writing a review for a book you dont even like? .... you can reach me at deepsinger@aol.com if you would like to discuss it."
2,Absolute drivel,"I kept reading this thing on the slim hope that it could say something, anything, to justify it's immense popularity. It never did and remains in my mind a monument to the ineffectual thinking and the daydreaming of most homosapiens"
2,Needs a blonde and a camel chase.,"I expected something more original. Richard Bach's Illusions: The Adventures of a Reluctant Messiah does a better job of demonstrating the principle of letting go and following your dreams. If only Mr. Coelho had thrown in a busty blonde, a camel chase, and ended it with a bloody shootout at the pyramids. Now, there's a, by-god, story!"
2,Childish,This book was not up to standard. Boring.It drags on and on. The ending is not satidfying.Most books on Amazon are rated 4 or 5.It makes me wonder.
2,Boring,Needs more twists and a more interesting plot that keeps the reader engaged. But it was not terrible but on the other hand it wasnt good either
2,Self-serving narcissism,"The protagonist learns his own power and that he will find ""Treasure"" when he finds his own heart? What about the gypsy seer he was so rude to? Does he owe her an apolgy, if not 10% of his material gain? Does the desert beauty have her own dream, or is she just the protagonist's projection of his ideal (fatalistic) woman who won't complain if he goes off and does his own thing to attend to her needs whenever it happens to suit him? Is the ticket to the universal soul simply desiring something? I do wish a more worthy boy would have been inserted in the leading role. You will know them by their fruits... Is there any hope that in a sequel the boy might pay it forward? Somehow I doubt it."
2,Weakly written,"The author throws in a bunch of random info that isn't interesting, doesn't add to the story, and in some cases is just confusing. At the same time, I found the magic aspect to be unimaginative, and the internal conflict created between the characters is weak and strained, at best."
1,simplistic and pompous,"How can a book be both simplistic and pretentious? This book does it. Another thing, repetitious. For instance, I wanted to scream each time I read, ""men/women of the desert."" I know it's a fable, but I have a problem when a person speaks to inanimate objects (such as wind, sun, heart) and actually gets a dialogue."
2,Why all the hype?,"Having just finished The Alchemist by Paulo Coelho, I must say that it certainly did not live up to my expectations. Probably those who most enjoy this simple story were not influenced by all the hype and therefore did not expect as much out of this book as I did. Having let down my high expectations, I was left wondering why it took Coelho 167 pages to say that we should all follow dreams, no matter what obstacles stand in our way. While I commend Coelho for wanting to convey this message, I just don't believe The Alchemist was the best avenue in doing so. In summary, the simplistic tone and bare-bones message of the book makes it a quick read that would be more applicable for a teenager than for adults."
1,sounds like deepak,The lines quoted in the Amazon review are straight out of THE RETURN OF MERLIN by Deepak Chopra.
3,"But ""Howzaaaaat!' is better","HOWZAAAAAT! written by Anglo-Indian Neal Whittle (or is it Ravi Balakrishnan?)who is resident in Australia is ""The Alchemist"" in cricket whites.I think Neal Whittle's debut novel is a much superior read....a real WOW!!! He writes from the deep conviction that,if we have the courage to discover our own inner magic and the determination to believe in it,then....miracles are possible...the chief of which is that we can change things for the better,maybe starting with ourselves.If you enjoyed ""The Alchemist"", you'll be thrilled with ""Howzaaaaat!"""
1,Nap time reading,"I began this book looking for a fast, short read and hoping that they hype was true - the book offered a fascinating insight to the reader. At first, I was pleased with the simple writing - it read like a bed time story - I looked forward to the culmination of the almost rambling tale. By 100 pages in, I no longer cared if this book held the secret to life - it was BORING!!!! The quaint, simplistic style became insultingly childlike and the rambling became a chaotic assortment of characters who in themselves were uninteresting and almost annoying. I shelved a lousey 160 page book without finishing it and I have no qualms about it. All this book did for me was to make me tired of the entire notion of the meaning of life and sick of characters who are too ignorant to find a happy path through life without it being spelled out for them by total strangers. Save your money."
5,"Wonderful book, Wonderful Writer!","Inspirational! You have to read this book, It will change your life!"
3,not an original,it drives me nuts that it is not often mentioned that this story was based on a tale from the 1001 arabian nights. not to say that coelho's version doesnt add anything new or is a pleasant enough read. it certainly is a lighter read than borge's version of the same tale..but at least borges makes it clear that his version is based on a tale from the 1001 arabian nights.
1,A waste of time,"I had high hopes for this book, based on it's popularity, I guess. Or perhaps I'd seen so many references to it that it had wormed its way into my subconscious. I had some misgivings when I read the jacket cover, but I thought, shucks, millions of adoring Earthlings can't be wrong, right?Well, I should have listened to that little voice inside me (perhaps that was my own ""heart"" talking to me, which I ignored to my chagrin). What a bunch of pseudo-religious poppy-cock! I've been more ""moved"" by some of the patently false urban legends circulating on the internet.As one reviewer suggested, perhaps the translator is to blame. But wait--he or she can't be blamed for lack of character development, stupid plot, and plodding prose. Could this be the greatest hoodwinking ever of the global reading public? Where can I get a piece of that action?!?!"
2,the alchemist,"I'm almost finished reading the alchemist. The book hasn't done a thing for me so far, I hope I can at least finish it!"
2,Run-of-the-Mill storyline,"The story of a boy who has the courage to part his simple ordinary life in search of something greater. I found the book to be like many other stories I have read in that it is written in a simple format with a ""this is the morale of the story"" type of ending. I was rather unimpressed and frankly don't understand all the hype this book has generated. The writing style was not particularly riveting either, probably because it was translated from Portuguese into a basic form of English so some of the meaning may have been lost. The story is inspiring, positive and has a good message overall, but so do so many other books that are better written..."
1,Read 1001 Arabian Nights,"I tend to stay away from books that are pushed on the masses. I am not a snob. It is just that my reading sensibilities tend to run counter to the populace. On some ocassions my literary taste meshes with what the world seems to like. ""The Alchemist"" was not that book for me. The whole time I was reading it I had a feeling that I had read the story before. It wasn't until I got to the end did I realize that I had. It is one of many stories in 1001 Arabian Nights. That telling is short, sweet and much more powerful. Coelho drags the story out thereby losing much of the poignancy. Brevity is often the better choice when telling a story. Compare the two tellings of the story and you will agree. Word."
1,Absolutely annoying,"This book belongs to the newly-fashionable trend according to which, the worse-written and emptier a book is, the more ""wisdom"" and ""life teachings"" it is reported to contain! Please! It didn't tell me anything I didn't know since I was five - and it's not even as touching and delicate as ""The Little Prince""!"
1,This is the worst book I've ever been required to read,"This review is about as rich and engaging as the book is. I was forced to read it for an activity I am reading, and the minute I read a few paragraphs, my heart sank. I knew I had to continue on with this book, in order to teach it. Despair does not even describe how I feel now, as I go to try and teach a book I could not even bring myself to read."
3,Charming Perspective on Way of Life,"Charming little tale of fate, will, luck, & spiritual enlightenment. Symbolism galore with subtle religious references. Offers an insight into one's purpose on earth and reason to live, as well as urges others to discover their ""personal legend"".*"
1,Rehash of a tired self-awareness trudge,Don't bother with this one. I challenge you to stay awake through the first few pages. I though I was buying a great Brazilian novel like the Seamstress and was sorely disappointed. Too many great books out there to waste your time on this drivel.
2,Not the best book,I was expecting more from this book and was disappointed. I'd get it from the library if I were you.
3,Entertaining but not amazing...,"This was an interesting story but nothing I haven't learned from any other philisophical book. Then again, if you want to really know about Melchezedik and the Urim and Thummim then I would suggest immersing yourself in the Bible or the Book of Mormon and finding much more fulfillment."
1,What a huge waste of time,"What a load of crap. I read this book because my girlfriend bought it for me as a gift. I have to say that it is the worst gift I have ever received. This is nothing but a buch of new age spiritual mumbo jumbo. ""The boy reached through to the Soul of the World and saw that it was part of the Soul of God. And he saw that the Soul of God was his own soul. And that he, a boy, could perform miracles."" Ugh!Fortunately the book is short. When you finish you're just glad that it wasn't longer and wasted even more of your time."
5,Short Book But One to Be Savoured and Contemplated,"I picked up this book while traveling and it was just a perfect book for me at the time. Paul Cohelo writes of the journey of a young man and a teacher of life, or 'an alchemist.'I realize that some may view this story as very simplistic or even a boring read. I myself found it fascinating from my lived experience of viewing 'life as journey.' I recall one of my college teachers years ago speaking of Kierkegaard and his writings on Purity of Heart As The Will to Live One Thing. Cohelo's story has rekindled my interest in that theme as well as some of the themes that Don Juan in the Carlos Castenada series addresses to his student.An excellent and thought provoking book not to be rushed despite its brevity.Daniel J. Maloney, Saint Paul, Minnesota USA"
2,Back to Oz,"When I read the last page of this book I thought ""Wow, I just read The Wizard of Oz."" Except that The Wizard of Oz was a lot better."
1,I don't understand the accolades,"I was really looking forward to read this book having heard so much about it. I was utterly disappointed. Quite honestly, I am puzzled how this book earned such rave reviews (""will change your life"" etc.). The book is simplistic, naive, cute maybe. It reminded me of the time when my mother read stories to me when I was a little kid. I would rate it with zero stars if I could. The book is thin and you can read it easily within two days or one if you got the time. I would not waste my time on it."
5,well done,Paulo Coelho's novel is an instant classic about a young man's journey to discover his purpose in life and his place in the universe. A great read for a wide audience.
4,interesting read,"I enjoyed the twists and turns of the book. Character development is good with an interesting story although the ending was a disappointment. Ah, but don't we always want books to end the way we want?!"
5,Best book ever!!,"If you are frustrated with your life because you still have not reached your goal, you have a major change in your life, a major decision to take, this is the book you need to read."
5,Great,Great must get book. Well written and easy to follow. I would recommend this book to others and look forward to my next Paulo Coelho purchase.
5,A life-changing book!,"I must first comment that I'm in utter disbelief that there is anyone out there who did not think this book was a worthwhile read!!! Coelho's book has changed the way I look at life. I keep on-hand, at any given moment, some of my favorite quotes in case I need a quick reference. Coelho presents a story so inspirational that by the time you finish, you want to believe it's a true story. In any case, it will help you see the value in following your heart, and that every moment in your life, no matter how insignificant, is important."
5,wonderfully written and inspiring,Wonderful prose of this book takes you on a poetic journey of a man searching his purpose in life and meanwhile you discover yourself thinking about your own purpose in this world. Easy and light at the same time deep and thought-provoking.
2,too simple,"i agree with some of the other reviewers who have been disappointed with this book. it was recommended to me as a life-changer. while sweet and magical, it is the kind of book i would perhaps read to my child (if i had one) at bedtime. it is a fairy tale. there is nothing wrong with that in and of itself. however, it lacks substance. for example, it may say (and i'm paraphrasing) that ""over time the boy learned to listen to his heart"". how? what happened? another reviewer mentioned that he never makes mistakes and this is true. the boy always seems to have revelations at just the right time and never has to learn from mistakes, only realizes the truth before it is needed. coelho leaves out all the meaty bits. it almost seems like a summary of itself. like the cliff notes for a very good book."
1,Profoundly insipid,"Profoundly vapid, insipid, merit-less, pseudo-spiritual tripe. If Cinderella is your idea of a good read, this will appeal to you. Could have been written in the time it takes to read. Next to this, the Harry Potter series merits a Nobel. Humor, plotting, character development, intelligence, descriptiveness are all absent from this. Like a bad classics comic without the nice drawings."
3,Good Message Weakly Written,"I can see why The Alchemist has appealed to a lot of people. The book is basically one positive message, conveyed with New Age language and seasoned with Jewish/Mormon mythology. But, while the book's message is sound, I found the writing to be weak. I understand that Coelho was trying to write a modern fairy tale, and thus was keeping the writing simple so that the words wouldn't interfere with the point. However, instead of finding the writing elegant in its simplicity, I found it cloying. That quality, along with the near-complete lack of depth for any of the book's characters, resulted in Coelho achieving what he tried to avoid: have his writing detract from his message.The Alchemist is an ""okay"" book, which would probably be valuable to anyone who hasn't heard its lesson in other forms. But, those interested in that lesson should probably seek out other works that convey this point more eloquently."
2,I don't get it...,"I saw all the great reviews and the title sounded interesting so I decided to purchase this book. There have been only two or three books in my life that I had to drag myself through, and this is one of them.Sure, the message is inspirational and all that, but the writing is so simplistic that it teeters on childlike. Coelho is repetitive and it really seems as though he is writing for a 10-year-old. This is not great literature; this is a self-help book masquerading as literature for people who don't seem to realize that they have no concept of what makes a good novel. I would give this novel to a pre-teen or a person who has never willingly read a quality book in their life.Maybe I'm naive or sheltered, but I am amazed by the amount of people who are so flabbergasted about the whole ""following your dreams"" thing. Have we never heard of that before? It's not exactly a brand new idea."
1,Are You Kidding Me?,"Twenty Million copies sold worldwide? Laughable. This book is nothing more than ridiculous platitudes and cliches about having the courage to go for you dreams, and it's boring to boot. Go out and make your dreams come true; you don't need to waste one second of your life on this book as it won't help you in the least."
1,Naive,There are some simple and nice ideas in the book which perhaps would work for kids under 10. For adults the concepts discussed are naive and the storyline is simplistic and character development is thin. I was very disappointed.
4,Delightful and meditative,"Delightful little book. Especially good read for those needing a spiritual uplifting or a confidence boost to go forth and try to follow one's own Personal Legend.Simple, yet lovely. I expect this translation is not as lyrical as the original language, but warm and engaging nonetheless. I found it inspiring, and hope other readers took that same inspiration and empowerment from it as I."
4,Lovely,"I enjoyed listening to the voice of Jeremy Irons very much, and then this wonderful book he is reading makes it double bliss.The only comment i have is that is does not go on longer, i could listen all day to him!The book the Alchemist is one i never got round to reading, and now have listened to it to and from work, in the car. It is a wonderful book full of interesting views and philosofies. the descriptive quality is good, so you can see in your minds eye the scenery unfolding.I hope you will enjoy it as much as I have"
3,All the things your k-12 teacher ...,"...taught you rolled into 208 pages. A light read, nothing Earth shattering. A long way to travel for the lesson learned. But sometimes we must come full circle."
4,~Short Read But Good Short Read~,"is a short read,very powerful content inside this book--powerful message overall,very adventurous and exciting...the boy is obsessed with that inner voice the language of the world and to meet up with his personal legend he must! very intense adventure--i really recommend this book to anyone who is into Drama/Adventure---Maktub!"
5,Great book !!!,Excellent book that teaches to follow our hearts and believe for good things !!! The Alchemist has shown me to believe in myself and the power of positive thinking. It allows us to see that our right thinking will demand the universe to shape a beautiful world for us !!!
1,**YAWN**,"The book is made up of only 200 pages, which should be a real quick read, but because of its dullness I struggled for 3 days trying to finish the book. The book lacked imagery and action. Don't waste your time on this one!"
2,Not life-changing lit...,"I picked up ""The Alchemist"" on a beaming recommendation from a friend and I disliked it intensely. Granted, it is an eloquent tale about following your 'Personal Legend,' but does every single theme have to be spelled out in caps so I'm getting hit on the head constantly? Does the message of the book have to be repeated every two pages? And why does the tale turn from a boy following his dreams to a philosophical spiel? This is ""literature"" for dummies. Even though Coehlo said in an interview he writes for adults, this is just a packaged tale of magical realism to coat a fluffy tale that everyone already knows. Don't waste your time. It won't change your life."
2,Not as good as I expected,This book was not as good as I thought after reading the reviews of it. The author justifies chasing unrealistic dreams. Agreed that our hero found the thing at last but it was pure coincidence and not a fruit of his effort. In reality chasing for the meaning of a stupid dream is not going to take anyone anywhere. Justification of strong belief in intuition was the second thing I didn't like. The hero did risk his life in just because he had an intuition that the oasis will be attacked. And worse that the circumstances if the story justifies that whatever he did was correct. This book is full of such non-realistic craps.This book may be good for time pass but please do not get inspired by this story and start behaving like a crazy person (the hero of the story).
5,The Alchemist in Dope,"I just had to post here because I am recently reading a book called Dope by Robert J. Escandon that is in part, a very similar story to the Alchemist. The Alchemist is such a great story that it has influenced many authors and readers alike to think about life differently. The alchemist shows and tells us, of a very aggressive world, where hope is still found and irony is completely drenching everything around us. This book is simply good, a very good read for anyone. Now, to my next portion of this review. Anyone that likes the Alchemist will love Dope written by Robert J. Escandon. I wante to share this with everyone because i never post on Amazon, but just had to do it once i read a couple of Chapters of Dope. Pick it up and read it, it's one of the best books you';ll ever read."
4,love it or hate it...,"People either love this book or hate it. There seems to be no inbetween. This was my first introduction to this author and I think it was a good one to start with, considering other books he's written have also been considered ""elementary"". However, I loved this book. I can understand how some would consider this simple, but I expected that since it's portrayed as a fable. Most fables are told in a simple manner so a wider audience can understand.If one is open to what the author has to say without any preconceived notion tainting one's judgement, one's overall experience tends to be better.My hope is that you will give this book a chance because it really does have some gems of truth that should not be overlooked."
5,Lots of great quotes to live by!,"I read this book for the first time right after I graduated high school. I've since read it at least 10 times, and always flip to a random page whenever I need inspiration to keep going. This review will be short and sweet. There's a lot of great advice to follow from this book. It's very simple and a quick read, but it will stay with you for a long time. Paulo Coelho is amazing. His early books like ""The Alchemist"" and ""The Pilgrimage"" are truly inspiring and worthwhile. Pick it up, you won't be disappointing!"
5,An amazingly inspiring story,I loved the entire book. Read it cover to cover in one night. Paulo Coelho has created an amazingly inspiring story... Definitely would recommend others to read it.
5,Truly excellent piece of literature,"Having heard many good things about Paulo Coelho and having an interest in modern literature, I picked up The Alchemist. From the very beginning his very fluid writing caught my interest, and at times I had trouble putting this book down. He achieves quite a bit in terms of character and thematic development very concisely, and his writing never becomes drawn out or boring. This book rates very highly on my list, and I definitely recommend it."
5,CAUTION- May be hazardous to those who do not want to think.,"The spirit that is truly on a journey will appreciate this book. After many years of spiritual quest some are allowed to visit a very special spiritual place. Paulo Coelho knows that place well and comes as close as possible to giving you a glimpse. This book joins the ranks of ""The Prince"" and ""Evil: The Shadow Side of Reality."" Let he who has eyes see and he who has ears listen. I envy the person who reads this book for the first time with eyes and ears open."
4,Wonderful,"A story with deep meaning, about our purpose in life and how all is connected. Written like a fable, of a boy on a great adventure to achieve his dream."
3,Extended Fairy Tale,"This isn't really a novel so much as a novella or extended fairy tale.Imagine a very much thinned-out Siddhartha.The insights are pleasing and the settings fine. The characters are two- or even one-dimensional, which is appropriate for a fairy tale but may be a little vaporous for some readers.The paean to individualism is popular, most likely because actual individualism is getting harder and harder and less and less important."
4,A Great Read!,"A very thought prevoking book that challenges your outlook on life. Beautifully written, easy to read - an uplifting enjoyable read."
5,Wonderful!,"This book is in such surprising condition, like it just came off of the printing line. I am loving this book!"
2,Simple Story,"I haven't quite finished this book yet but I have to be honest and admit I'm not loving it. The basic message seems to be a good one: ""If you listen to your heart and follow your dreams the universe will help you to achieve them. In the face of obstacles have faith that everything will be okay."" To put a different slant on it though one review I just read pointed out that this book, in its celebration of rampant individualism can actually be compared to Atlas Shrugged. It's a very apt comparison.The writing is very simplistic with the same message being repeated over and over again. This book got such a huge build up and I was expecting something special but it didn't pull me in. Personally I prefer something a little more challenging that raises questions instead of claiming to have the answers."
5,I love this book!!,"I highly suggest that anyone interested in inspiring fiction read this. It is a simple read and very, very motivating."
3,The Alchemist,"Interesting, confusing, but glad that I read it. Makes you think deeper, it's about a man who found his faith,"
5,A magical journey about real life.,"I absolutely adore this book. It was recommended by a friend. I am not one to read for entertainment and have quit many a novel right smack in the middle because I find myself reading the same page over and over. This book I read in about 2 days. Most of the themes of the book are very common and at first it may seem cliche' but toward the end in about the last 30 or 40 pages I felt a strong sense of inspiration and I could not turn away. It gave me goosebumps thinking about my own life and the lives and experiences of those who are close to me. If there were a million other books of this quality, I'd own them too, but I doubt that many will compare."
5,Touches The Soul!,"This is truly a profound & uplifting book. It is very simple & carries a meaniful & compelling message to folow your heart's desire, not you mind's desire nor the desires & expectations of society.It is quite obvious that Paulo Coelho is a very learned & spiritual man. One must ruthlessly persue to associate with great minds & Souls even if the medium be books. After reading ""The Alchemist"" I was awakened to listen to my Heart & started giving supreme importance to my Soul.I pasionately recommend these books: ""Sidartha"" & ""Journey to Ixtlan"""
3,The Alchemist,"After reading this book The Alchemist, it really helped me to pursue my dream. This is the type of book that makes me understand more about my self and about life. But,I didn't really like all the fiction I'm into nonfiction. However, this story was great and I think people should read it. If, they like fiction books."
5,Not just a book!,"The moment I began reading this book, I knew that it is worth reading more than once. And when I finished it for the first time, I feel that this is not just a book. Instead, this is the Book that I would recommend to all people. It tells you about life, philosophy and other prospects in a very interesting and charming way. I have never read anything like this. A difinite 5 stars."
2,It really doesn`t worth it,"When you start the book the story of Santiago is cute, when he decide to go for his treasure is a good story, but when he start to speak with the dessert, the wind and the Sun among other things, it is really boring and boring, this book could be great if the writer kept writing real things, things that will really help other people."
1,Atrocious balderdash .,"Really , Really juvenile stuff . i`ve heard of a fairytale similar to this one when i was young , in india . at least that was over in 6 lines & never pretended to unfold deep truths .low grade crafting & rehashed theme . it inspired me .. to tear up the book ."
1,unbearable drivel,"This book was recommended to me by a number of people, so i was very curious about it to say the least. First of all, either this is a dreadful translation, or this author writes in a very simple minded, grade school level. Second, I am astounded by the accolade this book has received, given that it is not but a whole lot of hooey and hokey mumbo jumbo with a touch of religeousity and trendy spirituality that is so in vogue right now. I suppose this kind of material has wide appeal given this novel's tremendous readership!"
3,"""Inspiring reading, but not theologically sound.""","Although written with creativity and warmth, this work will not be theologically sound to conservative Christian readers. The tale's premise is that the universe seeks to aid us in achieving our dreams and goals, and that our heart is always right. These are incompatable with even basic Christian theology regarding sin's devastation of the world of man and nature.A much more realistic representation of achieving success through fundamental principles that are theologically sound would be ""Mizraim Principles"", which follows Joseph the Hebrew from the pit to the pinnacle.A nice inspiring read if one leaves it at that."
5,Awesome,"This was one of the best books I've ever read!!!For anyone on a spiritual path, this book will enlighten, uplift, and encourage you. Namaste."
2,Pretentious...,and trite is how I personally found this. Even though it is not a very long book at times I found it heavy going. There were some bits & pieces that I liked but not nearly enough. As you can tell this is not my cup of tea. You might want to read the blurb/summary of the book before you make your decision.
2,a bit trite and overly played-out,"i dove into this book with high expectations (perhaps this was my mistake), and after giving the book a chance for several chapters, all i could think was: maybe if i spoke portuguese this would be a better book.i tired very quickly from the repeated ""theme"" and message of the book, which dragged on page after page. had it not been such an easy to read writing style i would have given up on it before finishing.in hind-site, it's easy to extract the main and key plot points/moments, and they do stick-out as being fun--however, these points could have very easily been wrapped up in a third of the space, or perhaps ever approached in an illustrated children's book and been much more appealing.i would never tell anyone this book was not worth reading, but to me, it's certainly not worth the hype--the english translation anyway."
1,TERRIBLE,"Absolutely terrible book. the ""message"" was obvious. i was expecting something more after reading the reviews. the author repeats the SAME phrases over and over throughout the entire book . A complete waste of time and money. I could not wait to finish the book and get it over with."
1,"alchemy: promises riches, delivers illusion","clever little fable that is easy and feels good to read. it is a pseudospirituality that tells you what you most want to hear: follow your dream, listen to your heart; don't worry about the fallout - the force is with you.unfortunate reality is that most people who follow this philosophy don't end up living happily ever after. consider perhaps janice joplin, bernie madoff, brittany spears?"
5,Far from cheesy,"With the amount of life lessons that come from The Alchemist, it would be easy for the author's writing to come across as cheesy, or even arrogant. Quite to the contrary, the story is written beautifully and is far from cheesy. Short and sweet, The Alchemist gets to the point and doesn't waver through the last page of the epilogue."
1,Not a Book for Me,I bought and read this book. Very disappointed. My impression is a cross between Huck Finn and Harry Potter with a blurry line between innocent fable and spooky distortions of religion.
4,Good read,"This book was a good read, fairly quick and easy too. There are a number of books named The Alchemist, the one that a friend suggested was a different one than this, but it was a pleasant surprise."
2,No new insights here,"Not much to comment on--all of the insight/inspiration in this book could be found in a ""successories"" store. Very typical, somewhat overused tale, with fairly doofy writing. It is charming in its simplicity, but you can get advice like this anywhere. I couldn't believe how many times, in reviews and on the back cover, ""follow your dreams"" is said with a supposedly straight face. Great little fable for kids, just too shallow for me. Yes, indeed, I AM an American reader not captivated by this book, but I can see why many are."
1,Trite and Fatalistic,The Alchemist though highly recommended by a friend did nothing but disappoint. A healty attitude towards life is rigourosly drug threw a mire of close-minded fatalistic views. Yes I completely agree with following ones dream but Coelho creates a scenario that leads one to believe that someone has set up the pins and all we are to do is knock them down.
3,Just okay,"A retelling of a very old story that did not quite live up to its promise. A sweet little book, probably more appropriate for a 13-14 year old than an adult. It's a quick read...a diversion for a Saturday afternoon, perhaps."
4,A Fable that teaches about persistance,"Here is a quick-to-read book that explores a boy in search of a dream. Santiago knows what he wants, but unfortunately is guided on a different path. He meets a mysterious person and decides to risk all he has to pursue his dream. This begins a journey full of all sorts of perils and happy moments. Santiago's journey is a metaphor of all of our lives, and as one reads the book, one cannot help but to think about the course of one's own life. Because of this, I can recommend this book. I think that there are other more interesting books to read on the subject of risking all you have to do what you really desire, but this one can be read quickly."
1,"Cliched, sexist fiddle-faddle","I read this book to find out what all the fuss was about. What followed was sour disappointment.Storyline: No more sophisticated than those shortened bible stories for five-year olds.Style: I have read microwave oven instructions with more literary flair.Characterization: Flat, lifeless ""characters"", distinguishable only through phrases like ""the boy"", ""the girl"", or ""the Englishman"".Tone: Preachy and patronizing to the point of being irritating.Message: ""Follow your dreams"". How deep, and original.Further Peeve: Coelho encourages men to follow their dreams, while a woman's destiny is to await her man (""She never asked you to stay because a woman of the desert knows that she must await her man"" - p. 126). This is not taken out of context. Throughout the book, the whole ""follow your dreams"" motto is limited to male protagonists.Don't be duped by the 'warm fuzzy feeling' Coelho tries to leave you with. This book is as deep as a puddle.(...)"
1,Beating a Dead Horse,"At the risk of sounding like a killjoy, why has this book gone as far as it has? I consider myself a fairly spiritual person and I resented being lectured to--heck, beaten over the head with the Soul of the World. Perhaps this is a by-product of our secular existence, this grasping for anything, no matter how badly written. Jonathan Livingston Seagull and The Celestine Prophecy come to mind. The Alchemist is frustrating to readers who like a good story with their platitudes. One would do better to go back to the original Arabian Nights. There's also more to be learned there. One star for intent."
1,Shockingly bad.,"I think this book must have been written for ten year olds. The language and prose, (or the lack thereof), employed was so basic and stultfyingly simple, it bored me to tears. I couldn't get through more than half of it and that took me a great deal of effort. It was like reading Dr Seuss only not fun. I was only trying to read it because a friend had given it to me for Christmas. Are we supposed to believe in this character? Gets robbed of everything, but still, look on the bright side eh? I read about ten books a month, all fiction and mostly great but I just couldn't grasp the crassness of this novel. It reads like a Michael Jackson lyric - 'Let's all just hold hands and the world will be a better place' or what....ever. This one needs a minus star rating!"
1,Cheap Reading!,"Paulo Coelho books beside being cheap reading and not a great literary work they sound the same and feel the same. If you are beach reader, lazy reader and don't care about the quatlity this is a book for you. I disliked it!!!!!!"
2,it's ok,"it's still not on par with the little prince! i mean, it's good and all... it quite amused me but i was surprised that people actually compare this to the LITTL PRINCE...it's a good book, but not really great... at least worth a read. but i don't really agree with what paulo coelho wants to imply."
5,Excellent book,"A lot of pearls of wisdom in here. Inspire one to ponder their ""personal legacy"" and make the most out of the life we have."
1,Boring and pointless,"I found the book dull, repetitive, and uninspiring. I would not recommend it to anyone. I don't understand all the hoopla about this book."
2,"Just a modern fairy tale, nothing else","The first time I read this book I found it a nice fairy tale. After reading the others reviews here I decided to take the advice of one reader from Brazil and I bought a book by Viktor Frankl and compared it with the Coelho's one. Well, to be honest, the Coelho's book seems to be a little bit naive compared with the Frankl's. Viktor Frankl had been in a really ordeal experience and he really knows what he's talking about. Although Paulo Coelho's books are a little fancy, I still think they are a nice reading to pass the time.(but I really can't see how it can change someone's life)."
1,disapointing,"I was looking forward to reading this book because so many people had spoken so highly of it. Sadly I have never been so dispointed in a book... ever! Anyone with an ounce of common sense already knows all of the bits of ""wisdom"" in this book. Everything was completely spelled out for you, the author didn't give the reader a chance to discover anything on their own.Not to mention how repetitive this book was. If someone could find one page that doesn't mention ""personal legends"", the ""language of the world"" soul this or soul that I would be amazed. All in all, one of the worst books I have ever read."
1,"Nothing you don't know, all that cannot be done","A poor copy of an Arabian Nights story, this book pretends to show how to follow your inner self in a quest of self discovery. However, the character described is so poorly and superficially constructed, that there can not be any self to be followed and his quest becomes a series of worn out phrases you have read a million times before. Should they be of any use, I doubt the world would still be like this."
5,A personal favorite of mine,"I was actually assigned this book for a business class. This was a very quick read. Not since childhood had I read such an interesting parable. And since reading this book I've only read one other, The Five People You Meet in Heaven.I have not read any of Coelho's other works, so I do not know if this is typical of his other writing. This book is excellently written, which each character and scene portrayed in great detail yet using few words. As the review states this book is truly ""dazzling in its simplicity and wisdom.""While searching for buried treasure, the main character Santiago learns valuable life lessons and ultimately finds himself. I would recommend this book to college graduates. It demonstrates the power of following your heart, trusting your intuition, and not just getting caught up in seeking monetary treasure.This book will make you think and reflect. A must read for any age, but particularly those embarking on a new path."
3,Not a bad read but not up to expectations,"After hearing so much about this book I finally sat down and gave it a read on a flight recently. The fable is pretty basic and presented in a nice way but I'm sorry, it's not the great work of literature that most say it is. Sure, it is an interesting read but nothing life changing.It's not a waste of your time to read but only a far left liberal would give it so much credit as to rate it 5 stars. I gave 3 but would of gone with 3.5 if that was an option."
5,Great book,Our students for our private school enjoy reading this book. It has many life lessons and themes. A great read.
5,One of the greatest books of all time.,An inspirational book from a very inspiring author. Its the greatest pick yourself up book. Paulo Coelho gives his readers hope about the lives they want/dream to live.
4,A Wonderful journey into an interesting world.,"In ""The Alchemist"" I thought the author's fable about the shepherd boy, Santiago, and his travels were an interesting story. I loved every second of Santiago's search for his treasure by the pyramids and his journey through the desert. The book gave a wonderful insight into a person that is seeking their own destiny and learning from that pursuit. I did have a hard time connecting with the character Fatima. Maybe it was her fate, but I was hoping she would do more that sit around and wait for his return. Overall, Paulo Coelho prose is delightful, and inspirational and direct."
3,A bit too simple,"So I finally read this book and must say, it was sweet but not a 'must read' for me. If only life were that simple!"
2,Ehhhhhh,Completely overrated. I wanted to love it and just didn't. It fell flat for me and I know I am in the minority. It could have been all the hype and I expected too much but I just wanted more.
2,(*yawn*) . . . Borrrring....,"""Follow your dreams"". There. . . I just summarized the entire book. I picked this one up because I was impressed by the numbers and all the hooplah surrounding it. However, I dragged myself through this book- continually telling myself there would be a light at the end of this bland and uninteresting tunnel. There wasn't. The writing style was childish and confusing. The characters were shallow and dull. The entire message of the book can be found in any He-Man or Smurfs cartoon episode of the late '80's. If you need some watered down inspiration and like reading about magical and supernatural nonsense that doesn't apply to real life, go for it."
4,A mystical fable,"This inspirational fable by Coelho; ""The Alchemist"", is an exciting novel that bursts with optimism; it is the kind of novel that tells you that everything is possible as long as you really want it to happen. As the alchemist himself says; ""when you really want something to happen, the whole universe conspires so that your wish comes true"". This is the core of the novel's philosophy and a motif that echoes behind Coelho's writing all through ""The Alchemist"". Coelho also suggests that those who do not have the courage to follow their ""Personal Myth"", are doomed to a life of emptiness, misery, and un-fulfillment. Fear of failure seems to be the greatest obstacle to happiness."
5,surprised because it was pleasant,"My reading history has garnered the opinion that great texts rely on maxim that pain breeds great art; resulting in my distaste for ""little gems"" of stories and a disregard for anything uplifting as fluff. Books can expand your knowledge and add to your souls progression. This is an upbeat novel that I loved. It's a quick easy read but has great comments on finding your purpose in life and offers insight to Islam that put it on par with great Eastern theology, namely ideas of the oneness of all life and the individual's place in creation. How did Christianity lose that focus? Great stuff here."
2,been done,The Alchemist has all ready been written. It is very similar to Candide which I feel is a much better book/story.
5,Great book!,Great story! great messages and what a great way to communicate them. What is wrong with all the pretentious people who do not understand them and concentrate on the language and the trivial things ... they have lost the meaning of life...
3,Just ok.,"This book is just okay. I wouldn't pay a new price for it, but if you find a good deal used, it would be worth it."
1,"""Celestine Prophesy"" for 10 year olds","I read this book on the advice of a friend, and I have to say I found it horrible. After every section I kept thinking it HAD to get better. Some one saw me reading, and when I said I was having trouble getting into it told me it gets better. IT DOESN'T.There are so many books out there that actually ARE inspirational I can't see how this one is on the top of the list for some people. Truly, it is written as if some one did it as a long jr, high school project. There is absolutley no depth to the plot or the characters.Please - read something else and ignore the hype."
2,Much Ado About Nothing,So what's the big deal about this book? 10th anniversary celebrations? Who cares? If I'd read it 10 years ago I probably wouldn't have finished it. I only got through it this time cos I kept waiting for an epiphany as to why everyone raves about it. I never did discover why. Lots of 'deep' cliched morality messages wrapped up in a dopey story. Much ado about nothing. Yawn.
3,Good Read But,"This is an easy to read book with a good message. However, it is probably targeted for the young readers but that does not mean that it is not good. Just be aware that it might too simplistic and too repetitive for the experienced adult reader.The pacakging makes this edition a nice gift."
3,Santiago's Journey,"The Alchemist is a touching story of a young shepherds journey from Spain to Egypt and back again, in search of the 'treasure' which plagues his dreams. Helped along the way by friends, foes, loves, and of course the Alchemist who appears in many forms - Santiago learns important lessons about life and all of it's meaning.I thoroughly enjoyed this book, however was not inspired as much as I thought I would be (and as much as other reviewers have indicated). I guess you could say that this book is as deep as you want to make it (or you need it to be). Needless to say, it was an interesting read with many likeable characters and intertwined stories.Upon completion of The Alchemist, I tend to agree with fellow reviewer Ioana ""goioana"" in that this novel would make a fantastic childrens fable - with pictures included.I wouldn't say this book is a 'must read', but if you have a spare hour or two, give it a go."
1,Boring New Age Psychobabel,This book was drudgery to get through. It has got to be the worse thing I ever read. The only thing it stimulated was my gag reflex. If people see this book as some great work of art filled with profound truth then we are all in trouble. I have never posted a book review here but I felt compelled to warn others to SAVE YOUR MONEY AND TIME. I only read it because it was chosen by my book club.
1,Horrible,This book is a book we had to read for school and it was aweful. The book is terrible because it expresses opinions implying that Christianity is the same as all other religions that believe in 1 god
1,Terrible life lessons as a whole and poor literature,"I guess a lot of people are seduced by this book the same way they're seduced by The Secret. Somehow people like the lure of something for nothing, thinking that if they just keep thinking of what they want that they'll get it, or the universe will provide it. You can be thrown in solitary confinement and if you sit there all day thinking of what you want, guess what, it's not coming. So this book is not real life and you can't expect to will your way into what you want, instead you have to work for it and you need some luck on your side.The book does have some good quotes but that's about it. As a whole it's poorly written with no character development and a lot of religious mishmash that doesn't really add to that ""The Secret"" ""revelation"" the author wants to provide but instead just wants to leave readers with lower intellect thinking they read something profound."
4,The teaching about life.,I think the Alchemist book was great.It thought me alot off stuf about life. And I think the good thing about it is that he traveled too so many places.And in every place he learned something new. He had his goods and bad moments during his search for his treasure. Tis book change many of my decisions in life.
5,A traveller searching for a dream,"The Alchemist was introduced to me by one of my fellow travellers. I found it amazing and enchanting that the things we discussed over a glass of wine far away, paralleled the story of Santiago and his dream so closely. In this wonderful character of Paulo Coelho I found wisdom, insight and a hungry heart to match so many of my fellow travellers. In a sense it reminded me of the Little Prince - Antoine De Saint-Exupery. I will gladly recommend The Alchemist again and again."
2,When you try to tell it all...,"...you tell nothing important, but in a slow manner. The reason why it takes so long time not to get anything, must be the reason why so many people are dazzeled about his naivite, simplicity and understanding of life. Read this book if you are not fond of reading, it might proppell your reading skills enough to read books worth reading, but often more cumbersome. Or read it if you are into the ""alternative way"" of life. Eg. its good to be good , it's bad to be sad."
2,"Slightly simplistic, but still rings true at times","This book is pretty much what it says it is: a fable about following your dream. Coelho pretty much repeats this over and over and over in this book. At times, it can be pretty trite stuff...beware of sappy words like ""Personal Legend,"" ""Soul of the World,"" and other new-agey kind of stuff. So all that aside, the book was short and to the point, it can be read in one sitting, which is nice, considering that there really is very little plot. And at times Coelho does write a sentence that really does ring true to life and the choices a person makes. I think this book would be most appropriate as a high school graduation gift. If you're like me, 25, and pretty much not at a turning point, it will just seem trite."
2,A mystical tale,"A fable that attributes much of what happens to ""fate"" and belief in a supreme being. Not bothering to search for reasons or causes of events. It is a mystical fairy tale. Such books perpetuate ignorance and blind faith in an unknown spirit. It does not compare to phisophical books such as THE PROPHET by Kahlil Gibran."
1,What's the big deal about this book???,A badly written (I had the displeasure of reading it in Portuguese) cheap philosophy for those who like easy readable books for the beach.
2,"Wow, did you know, you must Pursue your Dream!","In a world filled with unbearable realities, may be it is natural that so many readers find this sort of magical realism refreshing and mistake it for wisdom. Like 'Life of Pi' which keeps beating on the head with ' will make you believe in God' I found the Alchemist to be child-like nonsense by page 5.'pursue your dream' give me a break!"
2,Airy,"Look for omens and interpret them the right way.Help will show up to fulfill your dreams if you understand and listen.You will succeed if your heart is in your dream.Sounds a bit like Jimminy Cricket singing, ""Wish Upon A Star"".If the sheriff shows up to kick you out and lock the door, then you probably did not recognize the omens and the help that was sent."
2,The Sample Got Me Hooked,"Unfortunately, after purchasing this and getting further into the book I discovered the interesting setting for the story suddenly became of very little importance as the author started very blatantly preaching typical 'self-help' advice to the reader. I realize this book comes highly recommended, so it just doesn't line up with my taste. If you also find this sort of writing bothersome I would recommend saving your money."
2,Children's Book,"This book was about ""following your dreams?""I think the moral of the story is that ""the grass isn't always greener on the other side.""This book is written for someone in junior high school or the high school level... it's not meant for adults to read. If you're in those teenage years, this is a worthwhile book for you (hence, the 2-star rating and not the 1-star rating).For the adults out there, you can obtain just as much wisdom about life by watching an episode of The Justice League of America cartoon (heck, the cartoon probably provides more inspiration than this book).If you're an adult and this book ""inspires"" you to reevaluate your view on life, you were probably never an ""adult"" to begin with (hence, only something as silly as this book would activate your brain cells)."
2,Item not received,"I ahve not yet received the book, i purchased the book on 8th October 2011. Its been already a month. I dont understand why the book is taking so long to reach here. I just hope i will still receive it.Thank you."
3,Not what I had Expected,"It is a good inspirational book but it doesn't depict the reality well(which is ok because it is a fiction anyway). Things are not always pleasant in life and neither is this a cinderella world. It's good to follow one's dreams but they may or may not come true. So, the moral should have been that you should try to follow your dreams but the rest is upto God instead of ending it with the moral that when you always get what you wish for."
1,Terrible.,"Please, don't waste your time. It is horribly written, boring, and uninspiring. I kept waiting for it to get better, but it never did. There are SO MANY better ways to spend your time."
5,Best Book Ever,There's really not much more to say about this book other than I loved it and so far I still consider this the best book I've ever read!
3,Decent read but nothing special,"The book started off well and I liked the boy's 'journey' to his desired destination. I enjoyed reading about Oasis and about rules of war. Considering the book is less than 100 pages, it lacked depth. Towards the end yeah it got a little over the top with talking to wind etc. Anyway, I think it was decent read, but nothing great."
4,"A well written tale - lively, simple writing and enjoyable reading","This story of a young man and his pursuit of personal fulfillment and self awareness. It is an enjoyable story centered on the theme of the relationship we each have with ourselves, and as a result, the world. You will enjoy. It is a very quick read and colorful writing."
3,A good read but somewhat over-rated,"A readable fable of a shepherd boy, Santiago's journey of self-discovery. The book begins with some promise - it is quite easy to relate to the main character and some of his experiences. The character of Santiago is developed well and I felt most readers would be able to empathise with him easily.Toward the end of the journey however, the author lost me somewhat with some confusing events/ metaphors. In the context of the book it appeared to me as though the author had reached some point on the journey which he had not experienced himself or could not adequately express his experience with the consistent simplicity of the rest of the book. To me it seemed like he decided to throw in a bit of chaos to cover this up which was disappointing.The story as a whole and the driving concept of the book .. i.e. to follow your dreams certainly comes through regardless and overall it is enjoyable... I cannot help but feel though that something is lacking."
3,One Will Either Appreciate or Hate the Simplicity,"This novel reflects a simple truth that what you're usually looking for is right in front of you all along. Paulo Coelho makes use of an uncomplicated character a young man named Santiago who is an Andalusian shepherd. He has a dream about finding his personal treasure at the Pyramids in Egypt. He displays courage and determination to find out what this treasure is by selling his sheep and travels to Africa. Along the way he will meet several people who will direct him toward that treasure. The Alchemist is the last person he meets who inspires him to complete his journey. He comes to believe in omens, fate and ""personal legends"". My favorite quote from the book is ""when you want something, all the universe conspires in helping you to achieve it."" Readers will either love the simplicity of this story or be bored to tears. One has to read with an open mind."
1,Coelho goes green,This book is a collection of recyled 'wisdom' told througha boring and hackneyed plot with a patronizing tone. We should all go green and put this one into the recycling bin.
1,Sentimental Pap,"If you need 160 pages of drivel of the inspirational fable type, this book is definitely for you.If you understand and agree with the words ""follow your heart"" without 160 pages worth of words wrapped around them, you might enjoy this book. It's a quick, fluffy read.If you don't agree that following your heart is the way to go, then unless you have a sociological interest in finding out why on earth this book has sold in the millions and what people read to feel better about life, then do all you can to avoid this sentimental, incoherent, cotton-candy pabulum.It worries me to know how many people have bought and read and loved and felt inspired by this book. We obviously live in a world of evasion and denial, and a world where we are hungry for permission to do as we like, instead of as we ought to."
3,"Easy read, well written","This short parable is written simply and clearly and is easy to understand. It possibly could inspire you to live a fulfilling and wonderful life (hurrah!).It's a good storyline, involving some pretty spectacular adventures involving a young shepherd. He meets a number of characters on his journey, each with their own fault, which the reader is encouraged to identify with. There's a clear message that the author wants to get across here, which he definitely does. It might make you re-evaluate your life.I can see that at certain points in my life, this book could have hit the mark. The author pushes a certain philosophy which many may find inspiring.Unfortunately for me, it didn't quite get there. At times it's a bit sappy and ""perfect"". But I guess that's the idea. Simple message, simple story.So it is a nice story, easy to read, possibly inspiring. If you're in need of spiritual guidance, perhaps this book is the ticket."
5,Reencounter yourself!,"I heard and overheard about this book and I never felt the urge to read it. And suddenly I found a link to this book just after making a decision out of courage, but feeling doubts.I'm so glad I found this book. It is not just a book. Reading it means transformation or spiritual rebirth.This book will bring your trueself back.Life is hard and when time passes by little conforts and convenience won trough hard work can detach you from your path and from the person you used to be and from your true dreams.Through Santiago's search you can find yourself again.Beware, if you read this book things will not continue the same.That the author has the same surname as my mother's family although just a coincidence it meant to me a good omen.Read if your are looking for something more than entertainment."
4,a copy on every bookshelf,"The front says it's an ""international bestselling phenomenon"" and the back says ""discover the book that changed millions of lives"" so how could I pass this one up? Very much in the tradition of Kahlil Gilbran and James Redfield, The Alchemist appears to be a simple read with silly self-help dogmas like Personal Legend's and Universal Language's. Yet, as much as you may feel ""deep philosophy"" is being thrown at you in each line, the story is delightful and it's ending - the unexpected obvious. A quick read that will rejuvenate your faith in the joy of being alive."
1,As deep as half an inch,"If you are looking for material that will make you think prepare to be deeply disappointed. This highly advertised spiritual book proved as deep as half an inch, or the sum thickness of its 170 silly pages. Each brings new lows of patronising teachings about as profound as fortune cookies wisdom. If that's what you're after you'll love it. And retreat further into mental hibernation."
1,Sleeping,"This book was a requirement to read for one of my adavanced courses. Usually, I have a pretty open mind to books. Though, this book was a disappointment. The same message is repeated over and over in a quite 1 demensional character. The actions of this book are very predicatble and flat. The message or moral used in this book is a classic, yet it shrivels in this text. It seems the author intended to only promote one major theme in this book, which becomes tiring. I do not recommend this book to those who thirst for action, romance, morals, or excitement. I don't understand the praises the book receives. The only reason I didn't terminate my studying is because this book is required."
2,Cheap Literature,"When I finally read this book (after so many of my friends telling me how great it is), I was disappointed: it is nothing but cheap literature with cheap philosophy. I understood, however, why so many people enjoyed it. It's because it speaks about finding your own way in life and avoiding failure. And everybody loved ""The Alchemist"" because they would have wanted to be like the boy in the book who finds his way and succeeds in life. Unfortunately, most people didn't succeed in life. However, they like to imagine how it would have been if they would have succeeded and that's why they loved ""The Alchemist"". I believe that a person who succeeded in life knows that things aren't as simple as Coelho says they are. And such a person knows the difference between cheap literature and real books."
2,"Nothing to see here, move along ...","I found this book to be similiar to the Castaneda series or even Celestine Prophecy. It is more simplistic than both (Yes, even more simplistic than the Celestine Prophecy), but I suppose if one needed a light read to remind you of what you already know, it might be worth picking up."
5,This magical masterpiece literally changed my life!,"I LOVE THIS BOOK!!! In fact I would say it is my favorite book of all time. I've read it 3 times and will read it again still. It is full of lessons about how to live and enjoy life as well as how to deal with fear and change. I highly reccomend this book to everyone. I suggest reading it slowly, the way you savor a fine wine. Don't try to read between the lines looking for the lessons, just let them work their magic in your life. Everyone I know who has read it found the same magic in it that I did. This book allowed me the freedom to face overwhelming fear and take my life in an entirely new direction. I ended up writing and getting a book published. I am the author of ""Master Dating: How to Meet and Attract Quality Men!"" Thank you Paulo Colelho for writing this masterpiece and doing what it took to get it out there."
4,"Majestically simple, inspiringly hopeful...","""The Alchemist"" is a book most remarkable for its simplicity. In the characteristic style of Spanish legend, it speaks of life's adventures through the story of a child and the world. Its tone is almost magical - certainly majestic. It is a story of hope, and that hope is fostered and encouraged by the books simple style. Yet the message of hope is slightly skewered at the end, when the validation for the boy's ""Personal Legend"" is not realised until the possession of treasure. In the end, it was not the boy's journey that seemed to matter so much as the fact that it 'brought him something at the last.' The message might be cause for reflection and question, yet the book is overall well worth the short read."
2,Too religious and superstitious,The flow of the story is not organized. I think.the book is intended or the religous mind. Bad for scientific mind. The good thing is the llanguage is simple and the sory is quite short.
4,Good read,"I found this book to be preachy but not over the top, and actually had quite a good story to go along with it. I would highly recommend this great and quick read!"
5,Great Book !!!,"Definitely one of the best books I have read in a long while. It is a book which is both captivating as well as thought provoking. This is the first of Coelho's books I have read and will definitely read his ""The Pilgrimage"" next."
4,"Glad to have finally read - a ""summer read""?","After too much non-fiction and a really great historical novel, The Alchemist fit nicely into my reading mix just as 2012 was turning into summer. A metaphorical, light read with some heavier things to think about was perfect for me! Pleased to have read something by Coelho but probably won't be seeking out another right away. Interesting footnote for me is the inclusion of Urim and Thummim in the story."
2,Very Disappointing,"I had been looking forward to reading the Alchemist for a long time. When I finally got around to reading it I must say it was a terrible disappointment. While I appreciate the simplicity of the story and the message it conveys, I just think this book was, for lack of a better word, cheesy. The writing is bad, often overwrought with sappiness and unnecessary capitalization of Important Concepts. The characters are unidimensional and the whole motivation for the boys journey is unconvincing. And it just doesn't work. There were some interesting bits, but not enough to carry the book. If you would like to read some better books of a similar ilk, try ""Siddhartha"" by Herman Hesse or the Chinese folk novel ""Monkey""."
2,disapointed,"After reading raving reviews and noticing record sales I decided to read the book. To make a long story short I was utterly disappointed. The author's fable about the boy ""Santiago"" is poorly written. I felt like I was reading a book by somone who had just completed a crash course in Philosophy 101. What the author does well is keeping things simple. I guess that's what people love about this book. He does point out obvious things, and maybe once in a while we love to be spoonfed."
2,Fortune Cookie Slips...,"I agree with other reviews which found this book 'simple'. Although the book itself makes a point of showing that keeping things simple is good practice.The book is apparently an international best-seller that came out in '88 and has been read by people over and over again and ... changed their lives. I read THE ALCHEMIST as recommended by a friend. While reading, I was building up to that feeling of change at several places in the book, but it passed quickly.The book is simply full of short, sharp lessons on achieving your dreams, learning from everything you experience, stopping and taking the time to actually study every bit of the world around you.Personally - I think the CHRONICLES OF NARNIA (yes, all seven books) by C.S. Lewis achieves the same journey in a much better fashion."
4,Evocative,"With simple prose, Paulo Coelho, provides us with a morality tale as timeless as ""Everyman,"" and as contemporary as ""Forrest Gump."" However, like all morality tales, what you get out of the story will depend greatly upon who you are when you enter into the story."
5,A Simple Fable With A Profound Message,"When I finished reading my library's copy of this book (checked out based off some little tidbit I read off the internet) I immediately returned and bought 3 copies of it so I can give it away. I have already reread it several times which is a very rare thing for me to do with a book. It's about one man's encounter with what he is supposed to do with his life, the spiritual disciplines behind the search and the ever presence of God's hand in our life. I suppose anyone can take the story which ever way they want...it just deeply affected me. I plan on giving this away over and over again."
1,Two words:,"Skip it.Unless you want your characters to be caricatures, your literary techniques abused, and your symbolism heavy-handed. In which case, you should probably read it."
2,Full of Empty and Corny Metaphors,"For many years I have been told to read this book. After I saw it for half price I decided it was the time. I was excited to read what could be one of the best books I ever had. I expected this because the book has tremendous hype. The truth is that I wish I would have loved it, but I found it boring, empty, and repetitious; so I found myself speeding through it just to get it over with. The book has maybe 3 exciting spots that last at most 2 pages out of 165 pages.Many of the things the book tries to teach are things that any person with what the book calls a ""Personal Legend"" can derive for themselves, from just living. The metaphors are empty, and repetitious. I found myself rolling my eyes every time I read a corny metaphor.If you have an analytic mind I wouldn't recommend reading this. This book is meant for people who live life on solely a spiritual level, and believe in life's signals."
2,Not what I expected.,"This book was highly recommended by a couple of friends and I had high expectations, especially with the teasers on the covers of the book. I was open to being inspired and I was just really not into it. Elixirs and legends are not my cup of tea. I think the overall idea was nice, but, I couldn't relate to it. I found myself skipping whole sections and skimming towards the end. At times I was able to understand and empathize with Santiago, however, I lost his mission towards the end. I almost got a sci-fi, Harry Potter & Narnia vibe from this book. Note I don't like any of those!"
3,Short and sweet,"The Alchemist is a wonderful fable (if I may call it that) on following your dreams without fear or hesitance. When you come to think of it, life really is that simple if you just believe and persevere. Coehlo's imagery is vivid and magical."
5,Excellent.,"Simple. Powerful. Magical. Minimal use of words which speak volumes. (Not as good as ""The Little Prince"" though!)"
5,Got It In A Hurry!,You make it easy to pass up the book store. I order and then get my book in a day or two. Thanks for being reliable.
4,La Alquimista,"Great book for anyone, but especially those trying to find and follow their dreams (read: college students). Combine it with Iain Holligshead's ""Twentysomething"" and you couldn't ask for better required reading in the second half of college!"
3,Not convinced,Hmm. I didn't really get on with this book. Maybe it's aimed at younger audience but I found the style a bit annoying. You are lead by the nose and plot points seem to get repeated on a regular basis. The underlying plot is very simple and interesting in itself but I did not end up being very pulled in by the story.
4,it was all right,"this book was ok. it was kind of corny in some parts, but it had a good plot and led you deep into your heart. it might, however, be a little too deep for some people."
4,Fun book with messages about the self aware universe,"This was a story one of my high school students gave me to read. I read it over a weekend, and I could not put it down. It was not the greatest book I have ever read, but it entertained me and was a nice break from much of what I usually read. It is a fast read, and it brought smiles to my face. I also enjoyed its synchronistic messages. I would recommend this book. When I have children I will definetely read it to them, and encourage them to read it as well."
4,Nice little inspirational story,"As stated in the title of the book this is a fable about following your dreams. It is fairly short and an easy read. It is set long ago, but it is completely familiar. It makes some obvious points (follow your dreams) but also some more subtle ones. The more subtle ones have to do with observing omens and believing that the universe (or god or whomever) helps you in the beginning of your journey and challenges you in the end. While there is probably some logical explanation it helps to think of it in these mystical terms. All in all a worthwhile read."
5,Simple but great book!!!,You can finish the book in one sitting. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT! Books are not written like this anymore - a quick good read. I would even recommend it for children.
5,This book will change your life!,Paolo Coelho has given every reader the lessons to help change their life. You will never be the same. Learn how to listen to your heart. Everyone needs this book.
2,Might not be for you.,"I enjoyed this book, but not as much as I was told I would. I think it offers up sugar-coated life philosphies. These palatable, romantic ideas are great if you've never read a book containing such notions or are beginning (today) a quest to question your life. If you have started already you are in for a simple story that can't guarantee any new insight and may actually frustrate you. I give it 2 stars because for someone starting their ""examined life"" it will give them some momentum."
3,Castaneda Lite,"This is an entertaining story but not outstanding in any way. The propensity of publishing houses to relentlessly promote well known authors is probably the reason for its better-than-deserved popularity. While I was reading the story, I remembered thinking that Coelho's style was very similar to the writings of Carlos Castaneda. Back in the 70s, when I was a young and impressionable college student, if a student did not love Castaneda, he was told that he had no appreciation for fine literature. Today, as an old and wise philosopher, I still think that Castaneda wrote while in the throes of a drug-induced coma. It was no surprise that the author cited Castaneda as one of his youthful influences. The message of The Alchemist is idealistic, if not juvenile. I've found that the way to make your dreams come true is to grab them by the horns and make them come true. It has nothing to do with talking to the wind or interpreting omens."
3,Smell my levanter...,Corny book.Great lessons on life.Santiago always worried about Gypsies trying to steal his money. I think one just stole mine.
3,ok book,"This book is OK, especially if you have not read many books of this genre. You might like it at a 4 or 5 star level. Otherwise, I think it is kind of boring."
1,bad??? reeeaalllyy bad!,"just a history about a boy that cry every time and at every situation. he's happy, he cries, he is sad, he cries. great art, bad history. just a fool fairy tale."
3,"Senor Coelho, You're better than this","I've just reached p. 155 of the Illustrated Alchemist. It's a beautiful book: beautiful story, beautiful pictures, beautiful paper. Lots of space between the lines. But Mr. Coelho, c'mon, enough already. You know better than that. There's more of the world's truth in Little Red Riding Hood and the Wolf, than in the Alchemist and the Shepherd. But, hey, it's 2 a.m. and I'm only on p. 155. Let's see how it ends."
5,Great book.,"This is a great book. Very enlightening. It's certainly something that I can see myself reading again and again, just for insight."
4,Follow your heart...,"This was a beautiful story about following your heart and learning that the treasure is in the journey, not the destination. In this day of pessimism, it felt good to read something optimistic and uplifting. Everything is possible. As the old king says, ""when you really want something to happen, the whole universe conspires so that your wish comes true""."
5,The Alchemist by Paulo Coelho,"This by far is my favorite story. Simple timeless truths, beautifully written. The pangea of books for dreamers of all ages. No wonder people throughout the entire world love this magical masterpiece.The words seem to leap into the heart forever, just like great music that one remembers forever. Inspiring over and over again - And you'll want to read it over and over again!I see how my own adventures in life affirm and parallel with the story. I am now collecting editions of The Alchemist for my library. Thankyou Paulo Coelho!!"
3,Preachy Light Fantasy,"The characters come alive in Coelho's ""The Alchemist"" and readers will enjoy the adventure. It has a light touch of fantasy that will catch the hearts of all without overwhelming those who are unfamiliar with speculative fiction. Yet at times the book is more preachy than it is ""self-help,"" which is the vein it taps throughout the book. The novel is short and has powerful wording."
5,the soul of the world,"Hear me people of the world. This book speaks the language of the soul. If you read it with your whole heart, soul, mind open to receive you will receive what you need to fulfill your personal legend. If you read it and truth does not reveal itself, you are not ready for the truth. All should read it anew each year because each year our ears and eyes and mind and soul become more acute as we exercise them. So the next year when you pick up the book to read it will reveal more and more and more of who you are. May our journey's be our joy without an unhealthy attachment to where we end up."
5,The best...,"This book is simply the best book that I have ever read. It is simple and easy to read, but contains the most important of messages. If everyone read this book and learned to follow their heart I believe that their would be a much needed change in every person's life."
5,A most extraordinary book,I read this book at a time in my life where I was trying to put my life back together after the heartbreaking death of my parents and my husband. I was afraid to ever care about anything again. This book touched me. It inspired me. The simple storytelling belies an extremely powerful message about the essential nature of life itself. This is one of those rare books that everyone should read.
5,Charming,I really enjoyed this book. I'm 24 - smack dab in the the height of my 'quarter life crisis' - and I found this fable to be charming and inspiring. It serves as a great reminder that following one's heart can be a fulfilling experience even if there are bumps along the road. This is not for the cynical type. Rather it's for those who are open to blessings that come in small packages. I intend to buy copies for friends.
3,"Sweet story, but not what I expected.","I chose this book as a recommendation from a friend. I was not previously aware of what the book was about. I found the story to be sweet in nature however, the religious moral was very heavy and sewn throughout the text. It reminds me of a book I might have read in a college course on text interpretation.In all, I liked the book but feel that the story could have been effectively written with less religious connotation."
3,"Review ""The Alchemist""","I don't know why this book received a ""RAVE"" category. I found the book in some parts truly far fetched which spoiled the story."
1,Shame on You Paulo Coelho!,"After Brazil gave us such a great writers like Jorge Amado, Machado de Assis, José de Alencar, Clarice Lispector, Cecília Meireles, Aloísio Azevedo, Ruben Braga and others, you come with your stupid stories and your bad taste. This book is PRIMITIVE and hurts the great Brazilian Literature. Shame on you with NOT LITERATY piece of crap."
2,Too Much Hype,"I usually pick up books on the recomendations of others, and enjoy books that offer life lessons. Reading all of the other reviews here I thought this book was going to change my life! I spent the $... (steep) and finished the book in about four and a half hours time. All that I really learned from this book is that it is possible to take good teachings from the holy books of several religions, add a tenth grader story telling twist to it and....VIOLA.... instant hit! Sorry - would only recommend to keep you occupied during a short flight, but spend your money elsewhere...."
5,The Alchemist-reading between the lines,"Though this book only took an hour or so to read, the impact it made was far greater than that of the most detailed book. Coelho writes in such a way that it is easy to read between the lines. The book is simple, yet the message it sends to the reader is extremely complex and deep. A young boy begins by discussing his life as a shepard, and everything he learns from his sheep. As the novel progresses, and the boy meets many new people on the way, the boy becomes more spirital and gains new understanding of life and how people communicate. I have read this book time and time again and gain a new understanding of life each time."
2,Childish,"I bought this book because of all the hype surrounding it. Sadly this is nothing more than a children's book. I agree with the other reviewers who put it in the same class as those disdainful self-help books. I think it's a good book for an adoloscent, but hardly something an adult would derive any value from. The book is full of meaningless generalizations and stereotypes. I suspect the only reason it became so popular was because it was written by an 'Exotic' Brazilian. Had the author been John Smith, nobody would care about it."
1,I have but one wish...,"I wish that while wondering in the Desert, the little shepherd boy was magically transported to Arrakis (Dune) and swallowed by a sandworm. Personal Legend meet Shai-Hulud. What annoying drivel Paulo Coelho spews. At least with a story like Slumdog Millionaire ones gets the sense of the gross improbability of it all. According to PC all you have to do is pursue your dream--what utter crap.This book may be useful for a teenager contemplating suicide, but beyond that, turn it to pulp for some other more worthy publication."
2,Good book for a young reader,"I bought this book after reading all the great reviews about it and I'm pretty disappointed. The book has a good message but that's all it has really. The story is very simplistic and predictable, characters were under described, the message was repeated several times in the same kind of way. The language was very simple, I felt like I was reading a kid's book. This is a good book for a young reader but I don't think serious readers will find it stimulating."
4,The Best of the Worst,"Ebert is one of the best writers working today -- I think any writer could learn from his prose. His dissection of these movies is pure joy for anyone who has sat through a bad movie, only to foam at the mouth afterwards about how horrible it was. ('Armageddon' comes to mind.) It is true that the post-1985 reviews are on the website, and the book is skewed towards current reviews. In fact, I had already read most of them. But it was a treat to read the older ones ('Friday the 13th part 2,' 'Caligula') as well as reminisce about the newer ones ('The Ghost and the Darkness'). Moreover, unless you're going to print out all the bad reviews on the website, it's nice to have them all in one place. ...."
2,Boring,"This book isn't anywhere as interesting as the title suggests. And worse it just isn't much fun. And unlike some of Ebert's other books, there are no additional essays that discuss for example what makes a really hateful movie. I give it a solid two yawns for a title that doesn't deliver."
2,Lousy book by an overrated hack,"How Roger Ebert got to be the so-called dean of movie reviewers is beyond me.I've come to use him as a reliable barometer in one way-if he likes a movie,I'll hate it,and vice-versa.He lost me forever when he gave thumbs down to ""Full Metal Jacket""and then thumbs up to ""Benji the Hunted"",on the same show!Don't forget-he wrote the screenplay for ""Beneath the Valley of the Ultravixens"" and still has the nerve to criticize other people's work!"
3,"I Loved, Loved, Loved ""I Hated, Hated, Hated This Movie"".","Ebert must have seen hundreds, maybe thousands of films yet he generally does a pretty substantial critical analysis. Of course, the reader can see, early on, that movie reviewers are subject to a lot of their own tastes and biases. However, it's interesting to see that he trys to provide enough variation in his written reviews to keep them from becoming ""cookie=-cutter"" likenesses. His ""take no prisoners"" attitude certainly leaves a lot of actors and directors figuratively bleeding badly."
3,"Enjoyable reference, but....","I couldn't help but think as I read through this book that most of its content is available for free on Ebert's own web site. (However -- The web site contains searchable reviews dating back to 1985, whereas the book contains a few 1970s clinkers). Ebert's site also contains the good reviews. Also, although this book contains reviews that received two stars or less -- Ebert seems to have left out a few less popular ""zero star"" reviews (""Sour Grapes"") in favor of reminding us why he kind of disliked ""Starship Troopers"". This book has its moments, so I give it 3 stars (so it would stay out of Ebert's ""bad"" collection). But, if you have web access to Ebert's site, skip it."
4,"Fun, but not unique.","Roger Ebert is one of the best film reviewers out there, but you'd do better to purchase his yearly film companion than to buy this book.The book consists solely of reviews of movies that Ebert has given a ""thumbs-down"" (in other words, two stars or less) rating to. Because Ebert is such a witty and informed reviewer, these reviews are often amusing to the point of being hilarious -- I found myself wanting to read several aloud to my boyfriend.That having been said, there's really no reason to buy this book. As I said before, Ebert comes out every year with a film companion that contains every review he's written over the past 18 months, plus a selection of interviews and essays he's written during that time period. The film companion is more complete and in my opinion, a better investment than this book, which I assume was produced with the idea that it would sell based on its funny title."
4,short but sweet,"great book, will definatly give you a good laugh and let you know which movies not to sit down and watch, or acctually what movies to sit down and watch cause we all know its fun watching a really bad movie sometimes, to point out problems and laugh at (aka Dead Poets Society, god i hated that movie, just glad roger finally had the guts to say something) so get this book im sure you'll enjoy it"
3,I don't understand the 'search inside' feature,"The 'search inside' feature is a good idea, but look at the choices you have with this book. Front cover (um, we can see that already on the web page, thank you), copyright page (why on earth would we want to read the copyright page?), index (not much good if we can't read one of the articles indexed), back cover (see 'copyright page'), surprise me (brings up a box with a disclaimer of some sort), and 'excerpt.' Yes! Finally! An excerpt! A one-page excerpt.Guys, you need to start over with the 'search inside' idea."
1,Watch The Movies You Want To Watch,And don't let this guy do your thinking for you.Love or hate the movie because you want to. Don't let Ebert do your thinking for you.
1,Wildly Overrated,"Eberts proudly displays how much he hates movies in the book. Sure some of them were stinkers, but ""hating, hating, hating"" them is excessive. As well, his comments sometimes have no explanation for their fervor. If you hate, hate, hate a movie that much, I'd think you'd have some pretty good reasons. Apparently Eberts doesn't agree with me."
1,Uninspired Trifle,"Pulitzer prize winning author of Beyond the Valley of the Dolls, Roger Ebert won't be remembered much longer then his late cohort Gene Siskel when all that coagulated pasta around his midsection catches up with him. Franchise greedy distributors, who often have the same owners of the newspaper/TV. media who give critics their free tickets slather quotes from Ebert and his one liner reviews on their products as if they were apologizing for it. Least buyer resistance conscience studios find Ebert's politically correct social palliatives congenial to their profits."
2,Where is Firestorm?,"I am disappointed that Roger Ebert did not think Firestorm was one of the worst movies ever.1. Howie Long acting, need I say more?2. The main character saves the world - boring and predictable.3. The filming of the movie was horrible.4. The special effects must have been from the 1980's. The computer annimation used to make the fire in the movie was one of the worst special effects I have ever seen in a movie.5. Firestorm had some of the worst dialogue in any movie I've seen."
5,"What a Fun, Fun, Fun Book","For a film critic widely known with such a simplistic method of rating movies (""Thumbs up!""), I found Roger Ebert's reviews of truly awful films very insightful and intelligent. And very funny. I realize not every bad review could fit in this book but I wondered where his review of ""Godzilla Vs. The Smog Monster"" was--especially since he referenced it a couple of times in the other reviews. The only serious omission is the heinous Dan Aykroyd abomination ""Nothing But Trouble."" Maybe we'll get a sequel from Mr. Ebert entitled, ""I REALLY Hated, Hated, Hated This Movie""...?"
4,He stole my idea!,"Well, OK, not really. But I always thought it would be fun to read a critic's collected *negative* works, and this was indeed fun. Nope, I don't read his annual collections--I have to concern myself with things such as food, clothing, shelter--so these reviews were mostly surprises to me. It would be a better book if he'd avoided the movies he felt lukewarmly about and stuck strictly with the real stinkers. It would have been an even better one if Pauline Kael had written it. But I'll take what I can get. (Why did Siskel never publish a collection of his reviews? I always thought he was more incisive and entertaining than Ebert, although I'm always entertained listening to the way Ebert pronounces ""because"" on his show.)P.S. Until the day I die, I'll never understand how the man who wrote ""Beyond the Valley of the Dolls"" can act so morally indignant over Isabella Rossellini's treatment in ""Blue Velvet."""
3,Breath taking...,"Each story fills your heart and leave you wanting more. I enjoyed each story but my favorite was ""Far From Home"" by Rochelle Alers. I look forward to reading more by these great authors. Be Blessed."
3,Too Obvious,I found all of the plots too obvious. There was no mystery to any of the stories and none of the plots had any imagination. I was very displeased with the complete novel.
1,A musty slog through the country slide,"Fans of the great E.F. Benson's Mapp and Lucia series will recognize this book for the awkward and charmless knockoff that it is. All the brilliant characters from Tilling are here in disguise: Colonel Flint, uber-dyke Irene, even the parson's mousey little wife Eve, everyone's been dragged out of their coffins and propped up around the tea table. Even without knowing Benson's work, it would be hard to warm to stroytelling this clumsy and stiff with dialogue that flows like a telegraph."
3,"Diverting, but Hardly Original","This is a light and breezy small village comedy of manners, a la P.G. Wodehouse, albeit with a gay theme. When a rich London theatrical producer buys the ""Hall House"" in a small village an hour outside London, and installs his young boyfriend there, wacky antics ensue. The books is chock-a-block with misunderstandings, mistaken identities, secret longings, and over-the-top characters. Per the genre, the book ends with all the characters gathered for a party which quickly degenerates into a wild fiasco in which all is revealed and resolved. It's all fairly diverting stuff, although I never found it laugh-out-loud funny, nor particularly insightful on gay issues."
3,Camp with Some Heart,"It's a delight to re-discover an author one adored in childhood.This tale picks up its pace almost from the beginning, with a cast of kooky stock English village pussies and curmudgeons enacting a somewhat confused and rather amusing scene in a shop run by an imperious, crafty and avaricious shopkeepress.The story proceeds to spin out a million twists and inane spins, binding itself in the complex tentacles of the ever-more-convoluted descriptions of unfortunate, inopportune and ultimately hilarious events, culminating in a frenetic meltdown featuring a ragged prima donna and an ethnic drag, amongst others.Though filled with characters scarcely fleshier than the paper itself, the story is gently amusing and never mean, the camp tempered with a touch of genuine warmth and just a wisp of sensitivity."
2,The glue is good but packaging design fails big time.,"Ok so I was at Lowes and I decided to try the Sumo glue because of its claims vrs Gorilla Glue. Drys 3 Times Faster & Less Foaming. Well fast forward to my repair, I opened the bottle as directed, and had to wait and wait and wait..... for this glue to come out of the bottle. I had to cave in the sides of the bottle and compress the bottom towards the top for it to travel to the tip, in order to use it. Sure it sets up pretty nice. Does have a little less Foaming Action then Gorilla Glue, but I don't think its any faster to complete dryness. I closed the bottle up nice and tight. About a month later I had another repair and went to use the same bottle of Sumo Glue, and it was rock hard. So I paid a little over $5 for a 1 time application less then the size of 1/4 of a dime. I would have given the Glue itsself a 3 maybe 3 and a half stars but the packaging kills it."
1,"Slow to set-up, extremely short shelf life","While the printed information says it sets up in 5 minutes, my experience was that it took much longer. Pieces being joined need to be clamped together for awhile.And unless you have a lot of gluing to do all at one time, buy the smallest size that will do the job - the shelf-life is not stated by the manufacturer, probably because they don't want you to know that the whole bottle will crystallize in about 3-6 months. I don't have any experience with Gorilla Glue, but figure you get what you pay for and will pay a little more the next time I have a gluing project that needs something more than Elmer's Wood Glue (big bottle, been in my shop for 6 years, still the best wood glue on the market)"
1,Don't be fooled!,"I doubted for a whole year whether to buy or not this ""All The Hits""double CD because I already owned other Jan & Dean CD's rating their""The Original"" one with 5 stars. My doubts were confirmed after listeningto this package. Most of the ""original"" versions are not the realoriginals because they are different from the ones we used to listen toon singles, EP's or LP's or on other CD compilations. Don't buy this:besides not being original, on CD 1 there's a lot of talking nonsensedisplayed on tracks 26 till 45 and on CD 2 some songs I was lookingfor are not original. This ""costful"" CD is a true rip-off!"
1,"Not what I expected at all...boring sound, no rythym","1 star only because it is the lowest rating available. I bought this CD based on the previous review and I am extremely disappointed. It is not even close to flamenco or even upbeat. I'm not sure what kind of music this band plays and I can't quite categorize it but it is not contain the upbeat, latin rythyms I'm acccusomed to. If you want upbeat flamenco rythms, you're better off with Novamenco, Rumba Tres, Gypsy Kings, Jesse Cook or anyone else for that matter. I couldn't even trade this in for something else at a local store. No interesting sounds or talented vocals come out of this CD..in a nutshell...BORING! I wish I could return it to Amazon for an exchange."
5,The Best Album from Isabelle Boulay,"This is THE BEST album from Isabelle Boulay! My favorite track is Le Coeur Combat. I encourage anyone who is a fan of Isabelle to purchase this album. And if you are not familiar with this artist, purchase this album to get a taste of French Canadian music! You won't be disappointed!"
1,Bad CD,"With great anticipation I was awaiting another CD by Isabelle Boulay. When first playing in my computer as I worked, I thought my computer was crashing. I placed the CD in a second computer, first wondering: why was the CD not playing. Then to my multiple stereo, nothing except garbage.Very disappointed in this CD. It was stated in excellent condition. Not one track is playable.Mieux qu'ici-basNot sure if this was the seller, or the manufacture.I love Isabelle Boulay, her smoky voice and beautiful tone. Very disappointed."
3,Townes Van Zandt,"I bought the sound track to Crazy Heart and fell in love with one song sung by this artist. I purchased the CD, by TVZ, which had this one song on it but had never heard of him before. Although I didn't love every track, I didn't mind listening to him. He sings quite a mixture of folk-type music, including Christian-based, with such feeling."
4,a lot to listen to,"There are two separate albums on this portmanteau CD, and it may be best to listen to them separately -- which is not at all a criticism. There's a lot packed into the simplicity of these songs -- Townes was one of very few people who could be described as ""intense, in a laid-back kind of way"" -- and trying to assimilate all 22 songs at once could lead to an overdose."
4,For The Sake of the CD,"Steve Earle is certainly entitled to his opinion, but comparing Bob Dylan to anyone seems kind of foolish. However, just the fact that many, myself included, consider Townes Van Zandt to be in the same league as Dylan as a songwriter speaks volumes about the late Texan's considerable talents. This is a nice pairing of two of his best albums. It's always cool to get two albums for the price of one. A great introduction to a cult hero who deserves wider recognition."
3,"Wonderful songs, dreadfully overproduced.","They are great songs, and he's of course an authentic performer of his own work. However, listen to these recordings and you will feel that, but will also come to wish that the job of producer had never been thought of - background keyboard, sudden ambience effects, the works, if only you could go through and take all that stuff out! Still very worthwhile, but what a pity."
5,"File this under Neo-Soul, and check out 'Circle of the Sun'","Jazzhole's got it going on! Try this CD, you won't regret it. Great on your sexy mixed tape with D'Angelo and Maxwell, with a touch of Meshell Ndegeocello. Their newest CD, 'Circle of the Sun', is just as good, maybe even better. I honestly would have a hard time picking between them, I love them both so much. 'Blackburst' has a few more uptempo tracks, while 'Circle of the Sun' is more chilled out, with some world music influences, maybe like Bebel Gilberto meets D'Angelo...Anyway you slice it, 'Blackburst' is a sexy and mellow CD. Hard not to love it."
3,Naruto Shippuden the Movie: The Will of Fire ( Blu- ray),"I like all Naruto movies, but the reason I gave the Will of Fire 3 stars and not higher is because it didn't have enough Action."
3,A good distraction for a lazy weekend.,"I usually like Naruto movies in general, but this one seemed kind of lacking. It is a decent enough movie and perfect for a rainy weekend when everyone is out of the house and nothing else is on t.v. There isn't anything I can point out in particular, it's just when all is said and done, this isn't one of the more memorable movies. I had to stop and think about what happened in this movie before I could review it."
3,"He's older but still the same ol' nuckle headed Naruto ""Believe it!""",It's more of the same from the Naruto series and movies. If you're a Naruto fan then you'll like or love it. If not it's best to rent it through Amozon instant video.
1,Extremely Poor B/W Contrast,"I purchased this for use in word processing as a transcriptionist. The added desktop was great, but the contrast in viewing Word documents was unbearable. No matter how much you adjusted the brightness and contrast, black letters on white background were awful. I didn't try this for gaming, but given the problem I had, I would expect the same. I gladly paid $50 to ship the RMA just to recover some of the money I wasted on this poor product. Stay away from Soyo."
2,not enough,I love theory but didn't notice this disk was only 4 versions of the same song. Careful what's on your disk before you buy
1,Poor AHL quality for 2 30 minute tapes,"Not the NHL tape people look for, no NHL action at all, look elsewhere for a better quality tape of NHL fights. If you're into AHL hockey, this may be more to your taste. Repetitious scenes used as filler to expand it to 30 min., and goal scoring and defense thrown in for 30% of the tape. Not what it is advertised to be."
4,Good ideas and bad writing,"It pains me sometimes to read the works of Phillip K. Dick. His ideas are always innovative and mind-bending, but his prose is somewhat lacking. This book is a fun read, and a great idea, it just isn't very well-crafted. I recommend for first time Phillip K. Dick readers the novel A SCANNER DARKLY, one of the few novels where Dick has both a great idea and a distinct literary voice."
5,Philip K. Dick = Genius,"An amazing book, dealing with issues of life, death, rebirth, and entropy. It delves deeply into the subjects, exploring the hopelessness and despair associated with death, but also the hope for rebirth and, of coruse, salvation. Joe Chip is an endearing character, who grows from being baffled and confused to accepting his reality and dealing with it. Highly recommended."
3,Did we read the same Ubik?,"I wonder if the book I read is the same the book the other reviewers read. Same story, it seems, and same characters... But mine was not as good as theirs. Sure, the ideas in this book are great. PKD manages to create a kafkian feeling of being trapped in a world that continues to shift as soon as you turn your eyes. But there is not discipline in the execution of the story. It seems as PKD changed his mind many times while he was writing the story, and never bothered going back and make things consistent (since when Joe Chip loves Wendy?). Maybe what disturbed me was the total lack of attachment that PKD shows towards his characters. Other reviewers refer to this as ""characters are not developed enough"", but my impression is rather that PKD loved more the plot ideas than any of the characters in this book. Except maybe for Runciter..."
2,Ubik - confusing and uninspiring,"I'm a bit of a Sci-Fi buff, but found this book disappointing. The characters and background were not well explained and I found the final page that other reviewers praise as being so groundbreaking a bit of an anticlimax - nothing special. I'd recomend Asimov instead any day - something like the foundation series by Asimov (the fourth book in the series is perhaps the best Sci-Fi I've read - pure quality)"
1,The Emperor's New Clothes,"I've been reading Science Fiction (I hate the name) for the better part of the last 40 years, so I guess you can say I know a little about the genre.Ubik is one of those books that I've been using to keep doors ajar, to level tables. I finally burned it in a camp fire. It was a pleasure to see the book be slowly consumed by the fire, finally serving some noble purpose, namely, warming me and my family in a cold autumn night...Like most of Dick's work, Ubik is pretentious, high-nosed, the type or literary garbage that is admired by pseudo-intellectuals.And, as it is always the case, there is some evil corporation involved in the plot. No wonder so many of his books have been adapted to films. To make things worse, it is extremely boring tedious, uninteresting.I hated it with all my guts!"
5,"The day Glen Runciter died, I was...","Ubik is a rare work of literature. Without being overly preachy, verbose or incomprehensible [which most philosophy accomplishes to be all at once], Philip K. Dick has created a completely ""real"" reality, and then let it fall apart as he observed. This begs the question - was it real at all, and is it real now that it's gone? In spite of these philosophical meanderings, Ubik is a ripping good read, and will scare you half out of your brains when you finally read the last two pages. I can remember not wanting to fall asleep, worrying that I'd find Glen on all my dollar bills."
5,Book Received in perfect condition,The book (UBIK) came to me in 2 days! Excellent price and it was in new condition. Thanks! AAAA++++
2,"Trying too hard, far from the subtlety of other works","Dick once more plays with his favourite theme, i.e. whether reality is for real. But in Ubik he does so in a heavy way, far from the subtelty one can see in The Man in the High Castle for example. There are literally hundreds if not thousands of books dealing with Reality that are more subtle and smarter than this one. It's not that Dick was uninspired when he wrote it - it's full of energy, has humour as usual. But it just did not work out well that time.Age cannot have been the problem because he was just 7 years older (41) when he wrote Ubik, than when he wrote TMITHC.I am a big fan of Philip K Dick, but Ubik is simply one of his weaker books - most if not all writers have them."
3,Just awful,"This book was random and disconnected with a painfully plodding plot, ridiculously 2 dimensional characters, and horrible writing. It was so dang boring that it became a chore to read... I couldn't finish it and put it aside with a feeling of relief. This book is truly a three star stinker. I would have given it just two stars if not for a couple of interesting scenes. As it is I am being very generous."
4,Ubik Kindle,A good story about questioning what is reality. While this is more heavy handed than most of his other writings; it is still a very enjoyable read.
5,"Wham, bam, thank you maam!",An incredibly entertaining short novel that takes place in a seemingly absurd alternate reality that may as well be our own. PKD at his best.
3,"strange, not easy to follow","This is not a book for the casual reader. I've made it about half way through and don't think that I can finish it. I would typically give a book like this two stars, but it does have a some intriguing qualities. The descriptions of the characters are fascinating and the life of future (1990) is interesting in a back-to-the-future sort of way that can cause one to think about the limits of projecting our knowledge into the unknown of the future. However, the plot is often impenetrable and the language is confusing. I can see where this could be the basis for a great movie after it is completely rewritten by a scriptwriter."
3,"Interesting, but at times confusing","This book did hold my interest, although at times just to figure out the plot. The author does a good job of tying together many loose ends, but it takes a concerted effort to make sense of the unusual twists and turns. I enjoyed the book, but I suspect not everyone will."
3,Yawn.,I was never a fan of PKD for some reason. Ubik didn't help. It is highly readable and grammatically excellent for a SF tale of those days.Still....
3,"good book , bu i'm not as crazy about this as everyone else","I thought Ubik was an imaginative, creative exploration in sci-fi that is thought-provoking, entertaining and depressing at the same time. however, i did not ""love"" the book. someone else said it felt like Dick changed his mind a few times and never went back to pull it together -- i'd have to agree with this. i would've liked a little more character development and cohesiveness in the story line."
5,Claustrophobic Nightmare,"Ubik is a tremendous read. Dick is capable of terrifying the reader in one moment and producing laughter in the next. I have read this book over ten times, never failing to react to the characters, never failing to enjoy it. Of the many utterly brilliant books that Dick had produced this is both brilliant, moving and exciting. It sits easily among his best."
5,Philip Dick's most profound novel,"- More intellectual than ""Do Androids dream..."" - More interesting than ""Man in a High Castle"" - More reachable than ""Valis"" ... but with a little sample of the Dick(ens)ian way that makes each of the above a good read."
2,100 Words or Less,"I ran into the same problem with this sci-fi novel as I do with all of PKD's works...the idea is great, the actual process of reading his writing is torture.I find his sentence structure, word choice, point-of-view, and actually every else to be so clunky. His style is like being hit over the head with a sopping wet blanket.Yes, his ideas are great. But in the end, his novels are not worth my time."
3,I beg to differ....,"This is definitely NOT PKD at his best! I found it slow-paced, pointless, and mediocre. Maybe this is meant to be a reflection of what life, er, death is like? I don't know. I prefer the meatier, more complex versions of Dick to be found in masterpieces like The Man in the High Castle."
4,to be used as directed,"I hope this isn't Dick's best novels because while I thought it was really good, it was imperfect. More others should write science fition that is unconventional and even for the particular genre, wholly strange. Most sci fi is too interested in developing the details of the tchnology in use (this sci-fi can be great too) than developing whatever it is that Dick does develop. The characters in this book could use some work though, and the book is not entirely focused. In fact, I wish he would have stuck with the question of how a person from the future could live in the past and it's current ideas knowing the major events to occur. Also, WHY DIDN'T JOE USE THE UBIK SPRAY TO UNREGRESS THE UBIK BALM? Oh well, just a minor detail."
1,I want a refund,"It's under produced, I have to agree on that. But I guess that is what you get for an independant gospel album, right? Fantasia has mad talent, I hope her real album is better than this. And same for Diana, I'm hoping she does really successfil aswell... I'm sorry to bring the comparisons.. I know all the fans are sick of it! But anyways, looking forward to more releases from Diana DeGarmo and Miss Barrino."
2,F A N T A S I A,"Don't give up girl I enjoyed your singing on the American Idol. I will not purchase that CD that they are talking about I am just waiting for the tour. How could people talk about you the way they do, when you won on the strenght that you can sing. I would get so angry with myself when I missed the show. But my mother and I would discussed the show when I missed the show because I had to work, and the night you won I thought I was going to have a heart attack. I actually felt this way when I used to look at the Bulls and Michael would miss a free throw. Especially when they put you in the lowest group I felt that was harenderous. But look at where you are know. Take care of your child and yourself and make your child proud of you. Remember what you do in front of your child stays with a child. Also do not let a man take you down or spoil your career. I am proud of you."
1,Uh oh..,"Looks like 19 managment and the producers at FOX didn't check their stuff quite enough this year. Or maybe they just wanted to let this one ""slip"" because of their biased ideas to let Fantasia win. I am not saying she isn't talented, by God's mean--- YES SHE IS.. but it isn't fair to crown her the winner if she has had a prior recording. They need to check their stuff next time.Can't wait for Diana's next single and prove ""Idol"" wrong. It happened with Clay, and now it's Miss DeGarmo's turn."
4,A collector's Item - at Fantasia's expense?,"If you are a Fantasia fan, this an excellent collector's item. Is the family taking advantage of her new found fame? More likely it's the producers of this CD. Ridiculously, some reviews seem to be from still bitter Diana fans. Every contestant on American Idols has recorded something at one time or another before being on the show, if they were at all talented. Haters get a life! Music lovers ENJOY!"
3,She was great at 15,"I received my Barrino Family CD today from amazon. It's cool. It's a live recording (with a few overdubs added later), and it has the feel of a musical church service. There are two tracks featuring Fantasia and she's great. At 15 she was quite a lovely singer. I'm glad I bought it."
5,BEAUTIFUL...,"I THREW A BUNCH OF THESE SEEDS IN MY GARDEN CONTAINERS, AND THEY HAVE GROWN BEAUTIFULLY WITH LOVELY, SWEET SMELLING FLOWERS. VERY SUCCESSFUL, QUALITY PACKAGE, SEEM EXTRA STRONG AND HARDY."
2,Missing,"I love this album but the very song I bought it for is missing. The song Hurry, hurry is mislabeled and is half of one of the other songs on the album. The tag information of the tracks are incorrect. It was recorded from a LP, you can hear the scratches and pops if you listen carefully. The audio quality is poor. I could have done a better job myself."
5,Did not disappoint,"I had come lately to this series and had so enjoyed it I determined that it would be good to see where it all began, and as I said, I have not been disappointed. Excellent series. Sad that it's ending. Better than most others of similar flavour on TV @ present time. Thanks!"
5,Great show!,"One evening, I flipped through channels to find something to watch. At first, I thought it was another ""crime drama"" along the lines of ""Cold Squad"" or ""DaVinci's Inquest"". I still like the complexity of Chris Haddock's characters. So I was pleased to find another ensemble cast that had similar complexities and issues. One of the unique quirks of the writers is that the theme of each episode resonates through the relationship between the characters in some way. The characters are interesting, compelling, and ""real"" and the writers do a great job at not revealing every little thing about them right away. Their lives are woven into the storytelling to good effect. It is usually subtle but always present. The brief addition of Jessica Steen (the original Dr. Elizabeth Weir in ""Stargate SG-1"") in Season Two to fill in for Amy Jo Johnson was well done. So if you're not home, record it! You will not want to miss it!"
5,The 1st season of Flashpoint,The box was in great condition. There were no scratches on any of the discs. Found a three pack of the first three seasons.
5,Flashpoint - The First Season,"Flashpoint - The First Season...When I asked my sister what she wanted for Christmas, she said she really enjoyed watching Flashpoint and was hoping to receive at least the first and second season to watch it from the beginning; so I bought this as a gift and she loved it!"
3,good to see the beginning,"Shows the beginning of the SRU to where they almost lose a team member. Full of action, it is a good start and much like all first seasons of any tv series.They have improved the show since then. It is good to see how much the actors/actresses have improved. Very good. Recommend if you like cop shows that portray cops as being human."
3,Flash Point - The first season,"Living outside the U.S., would have been great to have a synopsis of the overall concept/story, but was generally happy with what I got. Will definitely buy Season 2 when it is available."
4,new old book,This is a new version of the very popular hard cover book that was a 'best seller' in the early 1900s which my dog chewed up.It gives a very vivid picture of the hardships faced by early explorers in central Africa. Good reading for history buffs.
5,Does the human race have a soul?,"Eugene N Marais was in deep spiritual conflict and eventually shot himself behind an ant hill. He could best be described as a spiritual naturalist. He saw the supremely efficient organisation of the ant colonies as akin to the organisation of a ""soul"", and I suspect he could not see, as a human being, that the ""human universe"" is in itself akin to this organisation, hence his depressive state.We cannot see the ""human organisation"" as having an organised ""soul"" because we are looking from the inside out. Besides which, the human race is somewhat chaotic (to say the least) in its organisation. The White Ants, in their relative simplicity, show us how disunited, uncommunicative and disorganised we are as human beings. Our evolution is going through a process of dealing with what we know as Greed (which is the ""Achilles heel"" in our continued existence). The ant colony, as a whole, is united; the human race is not."
4,GREAT STUFF!,"First, let me say that the list of songs presented at the Amazon site for this product does not match what I got. The Disc One I received had Rock Around the Clock, Tutti Frutti, That'll Be the Day, Sweet Little Sixteen, It's Only Make Believe, Sea of Love, Chantilly Lace, Short Shorts, Stagger Lee, Say Man, The Purple People Eater, Peggy Sue, Maybellene, At the Hop, See You Later Alligator, My Happiness, and Rocket 88. Disc Two had Blue Suede Shoes, Summertime Blues, Great Balls of Fire, Wake Up Little Susie, Poor Little Fool, Rumble, Ooby Dooby, Be-Bop-a-Lula, A Teenager in Love, Venus, Willie and the Hand Jive, Blueberry Hill, Come Softly to Me, Young Love, Sea Cruise, Tequila, and Crazy Man Crazy. Now, getting beyond that, let me say that these are original versions of vintage rock & roll songs and I enjoy listening to them very much."
2,BEWARE they Brake easily,"Take my advice... spend the extra few dollars and get better plateware I purchased this set and bought all of the extras after about 4 mos or so the pieces started chipping and breaking!! this is not exceptable I had bought the creamer, sugar, charges etc. I had to go out and purchase a WHOLE ENTIRE new set I ended up getting a pattern from _Saks Fifth Avenue_ that are ""thankfully"" more durable.I liked the color of the blue sango but as I said before they just broke so easily it's not worth it, and we were not rough with the sets either.Respectfully Reviewed"
4,Nice dinnerware set,"The dinnerware set is very nice. I purchased it to replace some broken dishes from my original set. I've always gotten compliments on this set over the last 9 years. My only disappointment is that they don't ""exactly"" match my orginal set which was purchased in 2002. The pieces in the new set are a bit thinner and larger than the orginals from 2002. The pattern is almost exactly the same. These are my everday dishes so it really isn't a big deal, but I wanted to mention it. The two different sets don't look awkward when on the table together.The set was packaged well with no damage and arrived quickly. I would recommend this dinnerware set. I only gave 4 out of 5 stars due to the inconsistency to the original set."
1,Cracking already and not 8 years old,"We received eight settings of the Sango Nova Brown Dinnerware for our wedding, as well as all the serving dishes, pitchers, glasses, and mugs. EVERYTHING is falling apart after 7 1/2 years of marriage. We only had children last year, so there has only been the two of us using it regularly. We've never had a dishwasher either. I'm shocked. I can't believe it's all falling apart, but every piece is full of cracks. The mugs are the worse. I've had them shatter on me while pouring in hot water from the kettle for tea. I'll be contacting this week to complain. I didn't expect them to last forever, but 8 years seems too short a lifespan. (Also, for 4 of these years they were carefully packed away in storage while we lived abroad.)"
1,Cracks and Throwing Out,I used to buy Mikasa dinnerware because it lasted for years. After we re-did our kitchen we bought these Sango plates to match. It has been less then a year and we already lost 4 bowls and 2 plates. They simply get cracks if you heat them at all in a microwave and just break.Horrible. Do not buy.
3,Attractive and cheap but very delicate. Break easily.,"I found this set cheaper at another store and bought them. They're very attractive, especially for the price. The only problem is they are delicate. One bowl came broken on delivery. Another small plate broke a few weeks later, wasn't dropped. And I noticed there's a large crack running along another small plate.For the price it's hard to complain much. But if you can find someone a bit more durable it's probably worth the extra price."
1,Stay away,"I agree with all the other negative reviews. Anyone writing a good review must have not actually used these in real life yet. They chip and scratch, and the glossy finish wears off. I'm not talking about years of use and abuse either. Ours have been used maybe six times total, and I won't even let anyone use a knife with the plates. I'm SO disappointed that I didn't register for something different when we got married. I actually feel guilty getting rid of these after my friends and family paid to purchase the whole set for us, but they're just taking up cabinet space. They look worse with every use so I'm not using them."
2,Crap dishes,"The plates ""say"" microwave safe but they get so hot when heating foods for over a minute. The cups are not microwave safe and I burned my hand after heating for 1 minute. They are pretty but this whole heating ordeal will get old. I wish I would have just bought the fiesta ware."
1,Poor Quality,"I have four of these sets and additional matching pieces, and they all chip, crack, and break easily. They are supposedly dishwasher safe, but I have noticed that many (though not all) of the problems we've had have happened while in the dishwasher.My sister has the blue version of this set, and she has had the same issues.I can't recommend anyone buy these. I've had less expensive plates that lasted more than a decade without giving me any of the problems that these have given me in the first year."
2,Cracks and low quality,"We got a full set for our wedding. Many of the bowls are cracked, and we just had a cup handle crack while heating water for 1 minute on high.Sango quickly replaces the dishes if you call them so props for their customer service, but the replacements also quickly crack. Seems like they just want to make a cheap product. Thinking of chucking the set for something more durable."
2,"Cracking, not durable","When my spouse and I first married, we purchased the Sango Nova brown dinnerware set because of the simplicity and coloring of the set. Unfortunately, the set was not durable due to cracking and we have replaced the set with some else. This saddens me because we did like the the set, but it just was not high quality."
4,Poor shipping,"I received this set with a broken plate, and was sent a replacement that had another broken plate. I did get a complete set, and returned the broken dishes. I do not plan to order dishes on-line in the future."
3,Not quite what i expected.,"Ordered this set of replacement dishes to fill in my set since I'd broken a few pieces. Great price, however, the size of the plates are significantly different, as well as the mugs, bowls and small plates. In fact, the plates don't fit in my cupboard, though my originals do. Also, some difference in design and color. Disappointing."
2,Not long lasting,"We registered for this set in brown for our wedding five years ago. We received eight place settings. I only have three dinner plates left as whenever they get to near heat (just sitting on the counter near the stove while it's on is enough) they start to crack. I have had handles come off the mugs, my bowls are chipped. It's crazy. I don't use them in the microwave and we haven't had a dishwasher until just last month. What I think is more disappointing is that you can not buy the pieces individually, only in sets. I got lucky once at a annual clearance sale at a store that was selling pieces from broken sets separately. Only get these if you just need dishes for a little while until you can afford the ones you really want."
2,They chip very easily!,"I have this set in black. I really like the look of this set, and I especially like the shape and size of the bowls and the mugs. The dinner plates are ridiculously huge, however, and while they'd be great for Thanksgiving dinner, everyday meals look silly on such a huge plate with all that empty space.Anyway, my husband bought 2 sets for me for Christmas in 2007, and as of 2 months ago, they started chipping. At this point, the set is little over 6 months old, and more than half of the two sets are chipped. I had replaced a Pfaltzgraff set that had lasted 6 years without a chip, and these couldn't make it six months. I am extremely disappointed, and am now looking for a new set of dishes. There goes one hundred and twenty dollars in the trash."
5,I've had the sango nova brown set of everything there is to offer over a year,"I have no idea what these people are talking about. These dishes are microwave safe, they are dishwasher safe, and they don't get stains on them from food. I have had no problems with these dishes except my toddler breaking 4 bowls from throwing them. They have served their purpose and look amazing. They look much more attractive in person than online. I am a busy mom, wife, and student. If I'm having no troubles from these dishes then I don't see why someone else would."
2,Poor Quality,"We purchased two of the Nova Black sets about 18 months ago. We like the styling of this set and it looks nice in a contemporary setting. However, as many others have also reported, with normal use the plates and bowls started chipping and cracking. I have had 3 salad bowls split right down the middle, 2 dinner plates have split in the dishwasher, and one split while serving food. We have lost several of the mugs in the same fashion; hot coffee splitting the cups.The plates also get so hot in the microwave, they are a burn hazard. With dishwasher use, the glaze starts wearing off, also.I would not recommend this product."
1,UGH!!!!!!!,"I bought this as a replacement set b/c some of my plates/bowls have chipped or dissapeared. This seller is TOTALLY misleading!!!!!!! The plates were SUPPOSED to be 10 1/2"" and they were 11+"" now all my plates/bowls do not match and the new plates wont even fit in the dishwasher :-( I AM NOT PLEASED. I would never buy from this person again!!!"
4,Good Stuff,"I am very pleased with the Sagno Nova Brown Dinner Set. I have searched for similar dinner ware for quite awhile. After finding this and ordering, and seeing the item itself I will be getting the complete set as soon as I can. Now if that is not a good review I don't know what is."
2,SANGO NOVA 16-PIECE DINNERWARE,"DISHES ARRIVED BROKEN. PACKAGING AND HANDLING WAS CARELESS FOR FRAGILE PRODUCT. I REALLY LIKED THE DISHES AND DECIDED TO KEEP THE UNBROKEN PIECES RATHER THAN GO THROUGH THE HASSLE OF REPACKAGING FOR RETURN, ETC."
2,Not microwave safe,"I have also had the problems with heating in the microwave. Even though the dishes supposed to be microwave safe (it says so on the box), out of 8 small plates, on 6 of them the glaze has cracked from being in the microwave, and several of those get very hot because grease from food has soaked into the plates through the cracks in the glaze. It actually bubbles out through the cracks when the plates are heated. Needless to say, I don't use those particular ones anymore. I only have 2 small plates that have held up under use.I really like the color but after looking at a variety of sets on Amazon I'm inclined to say that this seems to be a problem with stoneware in general. Which is unfortunate because most of the sets I like the look of are stoneware..."
2,"Beautiful, but don't stand up to heat","I love the look of these dishes. I saw some of the mixed reviews, but decided on them anyway because I didn't see anything I liked nearly as much in this price range. I just lost my fifth mug tonight. I drink hot tea often and heat the water in a kettle on the stove and then pour it into the mugs. Sometimes, but not everytime, when I pour the water into the mug, the mug simply cracks all the way down the side and immediately starts leaking the water. I haven't had this problem when using the mug for coffee yet. Right now we are without a dishwasher, I am nervous about using them with the high heat of a dishwasher when we get a new one in a few weeks. This must be a flaw with the pottery and I am surprised that Sango hasn't done something about it since this line has been out for awhile."
3,"OK, but it won't last","I have had the blue set for about 3 years now. While none of the dishes have broken, I do have some complaints about them. There is one plate in my set that has an uneven bottom (it wobbles when you are trying to cut something on your plate). One of the dish bottoms is starting to crack around the bottom lip as well.These plates are heavy, and a pain if you keep them in a cupboard that is remotely high up!Also, when microwaving them, they can become very hot! In one minute (think instant oatmeal)the bottom and sides of a bowl become quite warm, enough to burn you. They are ""microwave safe"" but I'm not sure who determines that..."
5,loved them,"Matched the ones I already have, not sold in stores anymore but found them here, they're great"
3,Breaking Dishes,"My husband and I received 2 sets as wedding presents in 2007. I love the look and have received many complements on them. However, last weekend one of the salad plates broke in half while in the microwave, and last night a mug broke while I was making hot chocolate. I would advise people with these dishes not to use them in the microwave even though they are supposed to be microwave safe."
2,don't be fooled by the picture,"I have owned a large set of these dishes for many years. But, recently the dinner plates have started to crack when used in the microwave (even though they are supposed to be micro wave safe...PS, never put these in the oven, they will break). So, I ordered the service for 4 to replace my cracked dishes. The new dishes are close to the same color, but they do not have the pretty swirl that my original plates have or that is depicted in the photo, it's just a flat blue. Plus they are noticeably different in size (larger). If the shipping wasn't was expensive, I would have returned them. Very disappointed."
3,Small plates break in microwave.,I purchased a set a couple years ago and then a new set about a year ago from a large department store. The set I bought first - I've had no issues with. The new set I have nothing but trouble with the small plates. Every single one of them have cracked in half in the microwave after less than 3 mins. I've not had any other issues besides this. I also notice that the color and shape of the dishes are obviously different between the sets.
2,"Nice looking set, but breaks.","My husband & I got this set for our wedding 3 yrs ago. Almost every dish & some bowls have split right down the middle. Two days ago was the latest one. My husband layed a spoon down on the dish after I just placed a pice of fish on it. Not even hot & the dish broke in two pieces. We registered them from BB&Y so are able to replace them, but it is becomming a hassle. I once had a plate full of spaghetti which broke on my hands while carrying it to the table. Sauce was all over our carpet. I'm disappointed because I really do love the look of the set. We have stopped putting all pieces in the microwave, but they still continue to break. We really don't have the $ to go out & buy an entire new set of something else since we have all the accessories to this one."
2,Size difference between older and newer sets,"I have had these dishes for 7 years now. I have some that have little chips and scratches on them, so be aware that they're a little fragile.My husband dropped a stack of plates while carrying them to the kitchen, and two of the plates broke. I decided to order another set of dishes since we could use a couple more bowls, too. When I opened the box and loaded them into my dishwasher, I noticed that the newer dishes were larger than the originals. This goes for the dinner plates, the salad plates and the bowls. The size on the mugs is comparable, but the paint scheme is slightly different.I would expect that if I ordered another set of the same dishes by the same company that they would be the same size, so I am very disappointed. At this point, I don't want to spend my money on another whole set of dishes, so we will use the slightly larger ones with what we have."
1,"Beautiful, until they SCRATCH with normal use","These are beautiful, and all the reviews about microwave breakage are true but silly, since all you need to do is NOT put them in the microwave. HOWEVER, they will all eventually show black scratch lines from silverware as our set is doing. We bought a second set thinking that it might have been the dishwasher, but now we know better.... so sad that I can't recommend this set, and wholly for this one reason."
2,Mugs crack with hot/boiling water,"My husband and I picked out this set for our wedding registry. The plates and bowls have held up reasonably well, but the mugs have many structural issues; I had a handle break to pieces in my hand while washing it one day, and at least four mugs have cracked due to pouring hot liquids into them, even after pre-warming the mugs by running hot tap water into them. I have read that cheap ceramic cracks under hot liquids, and I think this is the case with these mugs."
1,blotchy color,"I also bought the Nova Green set for four. They looked great out of the box, but if food gets left on the plates for an extended period (like overnight) then it affected the look and color. You could see where the food was. It took away some of the shine and left the color faded. No amount of washing or use of cleansers has been able to restore the original color. So I ended up with faded blotches here and there. I'm disappointed enough to shop for replacements.I would also like to mention that these plates chipped and broke quite easily. I have since purchased some Dansk dinnerware and have been extremely pleased."
2,"Pretty Dishes, but.....","These dishes look nice with a lot of different decors in my opinion...I received these dishes in the green color and loved them...until i started washing them and actually eating on them. They claim to be dishwasher safe, but probably 25% or more of these dishes I used got permanent spots and streaks on them when i washed them in the dishwasher...it was like the finish was ruined or something. So if you plan on actually using these dishes, I'd look for something else-- the santa fe type look is very similar to these....."
3,"Look great, don't last","We have had this set of dishes for two and one half years. They look great and we still really like them. However, one plate has broken in half while in the microwave and we have several bowls that have chips and cracks down the middle. They look great, but just don't seem to last. Our lasagna pan of the same brand and color didn't last more than 5 uses."
3,Not microwavable apparantly,"Let me start by saying I love the way the Nova Brown set looks, and it serves it's purpose pretty well except for the fact that I put a dinner plate in the microwave for 2 minutes to heat up some bacon and a minute into it, I hear a big bang in the microwave. I run over to find the beautiful plate cracked in 5 sections! Obviously not the best quality. I think I'll go buy a set that I can put in the microwave without fear of plate explosions..."
1,Sorry I did it...,"I would rate these as 0 stars if it was an option here.I bought two 16 pc. sets of this last year (along with some additional completer pieces), and was so happy that I'd finally have a nice set of dishes that all matched. The problem is after about 11 months they do not match any longer. They are advertised as dishwasher safe, but the pieces that we use more frequently are now discolored, the green is ugly and mottled. Also the acidity of foods on the plates seem to discolor them as well. We had a relish plate with many different types of pickles at a get-together, and the next morning after unloading the dishwasher you could actually see discoloration in the plate, in the shape of the pickles, it was like looking at ugly mottled green chalk outlines of dead pickles! I am so sorry I spent so much money buying these, I'd of been better off getting something cheap at any discount store. I am very unhappy with these."
4,Great Product,This is the set of dishes that my husband and I registered for when we got married last year. We decided to go ahead and get another set because we liked them so much. We love how durable they are to use. We had another set of dishes that started chipping after a year of use and these have done very well compared to the other ones. I highly recommend this particular set of dishes to anyone. Plus the color is great too!
5,Nice looking and durable,"I've had the Nova Blue full set for years. No problems. And when I break a plate, I can easily find a replacement.Boots"
2,Six years... And I'm done.,"They are just not quality and after having them for six years I am back to using my older dishes. The final straw was a bowl in the microwave for 35 seconds and burning my hand when the food was still cold! Don't get these, you will regret it."
4,i like em,"but as some have stated not all plates are same i have ordered three sets and got a couple of plate that were a little warped, i haven't had much experience buying dishes but just like the design so worth the funny plate i did get i give it 4 stars"
1,Don't buy!!,"I thought that we just got a bad batch, but after reading the reviews I can see that that is not the case. We purchased a full set two years ago not based on price but because we loved the design. As others have stated, the first to go were the mugs. I think within 6 months all 8 mugs were gone. It was crazy - the handles would just fall off for no apparent reason. Then the bowls started showing spider cracks and broke apart. So now that the herd has been culled of the weak, we are left with 8 full size dishes, 5 mediums, no mugs and 4 bowls (we had bought two sets). Its really sad because dishes do have sentimental value. My parents had all the various sets of dishes from when they were first married - the old ones just got boxed up and saved for the cabin or large gathering. And eventually us kids when we were in college. Oh well. Hunt begins for a quality set."
1,DO NOT BUY!!! DANGEROUS!!!!!,"Only believe the negative reviews. This morning, I almost burned my newborn as the handle fell right off my mug of coffee.... I've experienced everything from cracked bowls-exploding plates. I've never had a problem with the mugs till this morning. I can't believe that these things are being sold still. These guys are in for a major lawsuit soon.DO NOT BUY!!!!! DANGEROUS!!!!!!"
2,"Pretty, but not tough enough...","We've had this set for about 3 years and after about a year they began to chip and/or crack. They are beautiful and affordable, but they just do not last. I had two plates crack in half in the microwave. A mug handle break off as I slowly turned it in the dishwasher rack. It's too bad because I really liked this set."
