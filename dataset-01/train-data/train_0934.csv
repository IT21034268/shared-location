4,great read,an interesting and thoughtful read about a dystopian and not so distant future. orwell fans should love it.
5,"A dystopia so real, it almost seems inevitable","What a remarkable novel... the plot will be familiar to anyone who's had even passing experience with science fiction, but the execution is simply masterful. I run hot and cold on Margaret Atwood, but this exceeded all my expectations. It connects on a very visceral level, pulling you along with a gently powerful urgency. I can't recall a more believable dystopia - so much so that, in certain moments, her dark vision seems not just plausible, but inevitable. Makes me eager to read the sequel, Year of the Flood."
3,Readable but not great,"The first 120 pages or so of this book really dragged and were vague. When I came to understand why the author was named Snowman things got better. As more and more of the story develops things become clearer, but I was irritated by having to slog through the beginning of the book without knowing what was going on. The book got more and more implausible and I was sick of it by the end. While some of the ideas were engaging I didn't really like the execution of this book. I loved The Handmaid's Tale, enjoyed much of Lady Oracle, and enjoyed less of this book. I think I've had it with Margaret Atwood."
3,"""lite""-lit.--most disappointing Atwood yet","I was disappointed for largely the same reasons as other reviewers: Oryx and Crake is uninspiring literature. Even on the level of just ""story"", I would opt for Jurassic Park for gripping narrative and vivid imagination.If I read Atwood, Golding, Grasse or others that I consider accomplished ""literary"" writers, I look for an aesthetic pleasure. Oryx and Crake just plods; there is little beyond the events and a few clever (and distracting) neologisms to carry one along. I wouldn't even take it on the plane for a good read."
1,Booooorrring!,"I can't believe that the Gov-Gen, Giller, and Booker selection committees gave this book the attention they did. Clearly, it was a case of Atwood's name being nominated, because this snoozer didn't deserve it. It is Booooring! Condescending in high Atwood style, Oryx and Crake fails to present any characters of interest, or anything of interest. The story is boring, the settings are boring. Classic Atwood. That this dud won acclaim and something like Guy Vanderhaeghe's The Last Crossing was ignored makes a mockery of this year's crop of Lit awards."
4,"good story, could have done without cheesy names","I really liked the actual story. Ms. Atwood's writing is interesting and evocative. I loathed the goofy names, Nooskins, pigoon, rakunk, pretty cringeworthy. I had to mind-edit and substitute other words for those."
4,A Whole New Dystopia,"Is this my favorite Atwood novel, no? Is it still a tremendous read, certainly! The real downside to the story is that it will scare the hell out of you in a way that ""Handmaiden's Tale"" or ""The Blind Assassin"" won't. It's sooo easy to see science going down this kind of slippery slope and bringing us all to a similar end. I did find that characterizations suffered a bit in the name of Atwood's efforts to deliver some credible sci-fi, but it's a small complaint in consideration of the solid storytelling that still takes place."
2,A premise with promise,"I didn't feel as if the promise were kept, however. The story is told in flashbacks by the last human on earth, as he lives among our species's successors. The gentle, peaceful people of the new world resemble Eloi without the Morlocks in the shadows. Unfortunately, happy and peaceful people don't make good drama. There was plenty of dramatic potential in the story that led up to that point: in the actions that ended the human world, in the conspiracy leading to those actions, or in the personality capable of them. Instead, the world ends not with a bang or a whimper, but with a cheerful purring sound.Perhaps personalities with clearer strengths and weaknesses could have carried through the low-key action, or vice versa. I could imagine all the same elements being used to tell a similar story, but one that I'd find a lot more engaging. At least this didn't come across like some do, as a story with no ending. Instead, it seems more like an ending with no story.-- wiredweird"
2,Second rate science fiction,"This is the first Atwood novel that I have read, although I have heard her name and reputation highly touted, and boy am I disappointed. Her imagination, at least here,is,maybe,worn out?Could it be that she has simply burnt out? I will try something else by her, but I'll get it from the library. Oryx and Crake was a waste of money to buy, and I won't bother to plow through it,it is tedious reading. The writing is average to ordinary here, the vision is adolescent. You would think that with the money and staff that she has she could garner more sophisticated scientific data and put it together more convincingly. The sci-fi here is about the level of a comic book. The story is unfascinating, a poor plot,and the characters are not that interesting.How does stuff like this get published?"
2,Stuck through it only to realize it was a waste of my time,"I've recently been on an Atwood binge. I enjoyed the Blind Assassin and Alias Grace, but The Edible Woman, The Handmaid's Tale, and this, Oryx and Crake, fell far short of what I was expecting. Atwood didn't seem to put much into character development. Crake and Oryx, despite being splayed all over the book cover, are hardly understood. At the end of the book, I was dumbfounded. Why in the heck did Crake do that? Why trust the Crakers to his friend even though he seems to have contempt for his abilities? It would have been more of an enjoyable read had there been more action rather than having the entire book be flashbacks."
3,decent apocalyptic SF,"This novel is about a future apocalypse told in two interspersed storylines. One is pre-apocalyptic and the other post, and both are told from the perspective of the same protagonist. The overall theme of learning about the details of the apocalypse, like an investigative puzzle, was the interesting part. It reminded me of ""12 Monkeys"", but not nearly as good.Unfortunately, the novel is weak when it examines the details. Crake was not very convincing, and seemed to be a crutch by the writer to make anything possible by his crazy genius without much explanation or rationale. Other anachronisms and some storyline absurdities turned me off from this book."
3,Not-So-Guilty Pleasure,"I'm of two minds about Oryx and Crake. If you're looking for another Blind Assassin, you'll be disappointed. This is certainly not a layered literary genious nor an involving storyline on the level of The Blind Assassin. Oryx and Crake's future is a didactic, sometimes silly world where humanity pays for the lessons we aren't learning now. However, working within this stale dystopia realm, Atwood is still at her peak as a wordsmith. I compulsively turned these pages, reveling her her inventions, from her ludicrous hybrid animals (a Racunk, by the way, is a cross between a racoon and a skunk...how original?) to her pointed video game creations, where the worlds in the games are a grim parallel of the world in which we live.Any fan of Margaret Atwood will still love this book, for her voice is on every page. However, any fan of sci-fi will probably be disappointed, and anyone who's never read Atwood would not be advised to begin their journey here."
2,I hated Jimmy!,"I am more than a little surprised by the 4 and 5 star reviews. First of all, I loved Blind Assassin and Handmaid's Tale. But when I was reading this book, the ""feeling"" wasn't there. To be sure, the ""Minority Report"" futuristic world details were interesting, and, imo, the only reason to read this book. But could someone explain why Jimmy was left standing to caretake the world? His life seemed to be a total bore. When he is rambling on about his mother and his various girlfriends I wanted to throw the book across the room. And the coincidence of the epheremal Oryx appearing in his life seemed ridiculous. What purpose does her character serve?Thankfully I got this book at the library, not the bookstore. Give me the Crake diaries and maybe we'll have something!"
5,"Margaret Atwood is by far my favorite author, and this book exceeds my expectations","Loved this book so much! And it was really great reading it on my kindle. I'm impressed at how much biotech research Atwood must have done to get so much of this right, and so realistic (speaking as a biomed. engineer, I greatly appreciate it!)"
2,Interesting read,"Well written and an interesting take on end of the world stories. Not what I expected but if I could get my girlfriend to read it she would probably love it. I simply like the more practical perspective. Again, the author writes in an engaging and entertaining style. Glad I bought it and read it."
2,very disappointing,"I was excited about the comparison between Atwood's lastest book Oryx and Crake, with The Handsmaids Tale, one of my all time favorite books.It took much discipline to actually make it through the book. The story failed to develop the emotional excitement that carried the Handmaid's Tale so suspensefully through to the end. The book was conceived as a whole to Atwood, and I feel like it needed to time to flesh out into a more mature story before it was released. The concept was worthy of more."
2,Still waiting for something to happen,"The book [...] me in and left me disappointed. Atwood had some great ideas, but they never got developed. There are dozens of dangling story lines and unanswered questions that it seems are never addressed because Atwood didn't know where they were leading. Having an open ending is fine, but slapping together a bunch of unanswered questions and undeveloped plot lines just shows how poorly conceived this book was."
2,Unexpectedly Unreal,Totally unrealistic. I'm not talking about the crazy biotechnology. All that is plausible. But the characters are mere shadows of real people. They don't truly love one another. Parents don't care about their children. The closest of friends remain complete mysteries to one another. I'm going to have to re read The Road to remind myself of how people really behave.
1,Ugh,"I bought this book for a book club. I hope someone else wants it. After all of the hype, I am disappointed by the writing, the story and the ending."
4,It's like a French film,"I found Oryx and Crake to be an absorbing read. It goes beyond Brave New World to Brand New World. The issues of global climate change, genetic engineering, and class inequity are taken to their apocalyptic extremes. The most dangerous wild animals are hybrid creatures that were once confined to laboratory. The perfectly engineered Children of Crake - designed to eliminate the problems of humanity as viewed by their creator - seem ultimately doomed to follow in the footsteps of the human race.As the story is told in the first person by 'Snowman'(aka Jimmy), the reader is often left wondering at the motivations of the other characters. There is a lot of ambiguity throughout the novel -- Snowman raises questions that cannot be answered. And like many French films, the novel just ends without concluding."
4,Frighteningly Possible Dystopia,"Oryx and Crake is told from the point of view of Snowman. All we know in the beginning is that Snowman is the last known human alive and he's watching over a group he calls ""The Children of Crake"". Snowman tells us the story of what happened to the rest of humanity and how The Children of Crake came to be through flashbacks starting in his childhood.I am a fan of dystopian literature. Brave New World by Huxley and The Stand by Stephen King are two of my favorites. Although this novel starts out a bit slow, it does turn into a very interesting, eye opening story. The best dystopian novels are the ones that you can actually imagine happening and Atwood managed that with Oryx and Crake. I look forward to reading more of her work."
5,Brilliant,How could I have missed this masterpiece for so long ? . Ranks with 1984 and Brave New World but told in a simpler prose. Atwood hooks the reader with the enigma of Snowman's current predicament while interweavingher vision of a dystopian future. Some may not agree with her general thesis but she tells a compelling tale.
3,Wanted More,"As a senior biochemistry major, I was intrigued by the scenario and characters offered in this book. I plowed through in 2 days because I was interested in learning more about the characters, to understand the world they had created.At the end, there was little to satisfy my curiosity. The characters, I think, were meant to be allegorical, rather than portraying real people. Even so, I haven't quite finished unraveling this novel.It was an interesting read, but it has not left me significantly different than when I started reading - at least not yet."
4,Huh,"I liked this book, but it did take a bit. It's an interesting view point to the end of the world as we know it. I like how we are placed in a world where things have clearly gone wrong yet there is no explanation... it just is. As I said, very interesting but slow at first, so give it a bit."
2,Oh what could have been....,"This book had so much potential as Atwood is a very good writer. My main problem with the book was that her near future America could never be even close to true. The characters sit around and watch child pornography, bestiality, torture, suicides, and murders for fun as teenagers. This is a common practice in this America of Atwood's and is considered normal. Can anyone see this ever happening? No way because she ignores all morality, and thus religion, which is a major influence in the world whether the author wants it to be or not. I am not a holy roller, I don't go to church, but I can't see how in a very short time the world would be completely without any religion or morality. This lack of morality or religion happens without a war, plague, alien invasion, etc... it just happened. The characters are pretty much completely unlikeable and so is the country and the world. Please no one give Atwood the bomb because she will use it. lol, I'm joking kind of...."
1,Essentially trash,"Despite the apparently high reputation of this book, it struck this reader as cynical and extremely self-indulgent. Yes, the author surely had fun creating all the far-out science fictiony stuff, but where does that leave the reader? Like Nabokov's puns, it is simply tiresome. NOT recommended."
1,Cynical misandry,"This book reeks of cynicism and man-hate. The story fails to present a coherent theme, the characters make no sense, and the whole plot rests on the tired trope of the mad scientist as villain. I'll never read Atwood again."
2,Didn't even finish reading it,"Sorry Ms. Atwood - I still love you (read Handmaid's Tale twice), but I just couldn't make it through Oryx & Crake. Wonderfully written, but the story was just awful. Dark, cynical, devoid of any sense of humanity. What a downer. The nightly news is more uplifting. Perhaps I missed something grand by only making it 2/3rds of the way through -- someone please tell me if I did. Otherwise, life is too short to read something so dull and depressing."
3,Not my cup of tea,"The plot is to filled with hopeless lose ideals. The book is well written and I did not have trouble keeping interested. However, when finished the soul has empty not filled."
3,high expectations but low payoff,"I'm not going to write a synopsis here, as others have done a fine job of it - I just wanted to write that I just finished the book and was disappointed in the final pages regarding the character of Oryx. She is set up in a fascinating way - first glimpsed by Jimmy as a child on an internet porn site. She's described as wise beyond her years - but in the end, all we see her do is teach the Crakers about nature. Supposedly she is whispering in SNowman's ear throughout the book, but is she a figment of his imagination? I wondered if she had transformed into a bird spirit after her death, as hinted in the fables of her village early in the book. I guess I expected her to play a larger role in the events that unfolded in the book. As a whole, i guess I expected more...something in the resolution of the book. Crake was painted very broadly as the ""mad scientist,"" I would have liked to have seen more dimension to his character."
4,Oryx and Crake...,"This book was good, but definitely not Atwood's best. I agree with many of the reviewers that the characters could have been more fleshed out, and the protagonist could have been more sympathetic. At the end, I think I understood him, but did not really like him or care much about him.The premise of the story was excellent. The dystopian future was very funny, and very frightening because corporations today are trying to do what the ones in the book had already done.The questions left unanswered or that were not spelled out in the book actually help the story in my opinion. You pretty much know all the answers at the end even though you are not told.I liked Oryx and Crake, but not really Jimmy. He was too 'average under achiever Joe'All in all this book is very good, but would have needed more 'feeling' to be great."
4,Gripping,"Atwood is a unique writer with an umistakable voice and story tone. Since I'm a fan of dystopian literature, I was definitely drawn to the world outlined in Oryx and Crake and to the characters who had to live inside it. Though most of the book is beautifully written and actually becomes a page turner, this story takes a long time to get into. Put it this way: I read 3/4's of the book in the day, but the first 1/4th took a week!Atwood isn't for everyone, this is certainly not a lesiure read. But if its a unique, bleak view of the future you are looking for with unique characters and twisted plot lines...then definitely check this book out."
1,ditto,"All I can do is concur. In all cases you should skip this book, but especially you should skip it if you have any regard whatsoever for the English language. If you are interested in Ligeti (whether or not you're a musician), you should read instead GYORGY LIGETI (20TH-CENTURY COMPOSERS) By Richard Toop."
3,A Good Album on Its own Merits . . .,"but I'll have to echo the sentiments of J. Nussbaum. I found Gilt to be disappointing in the context of what MoLG had done before. Rather than stick with their evolving techno-industrial sound that produced the unique Concentration, MoLG released a good-perhaps very good- alternative metal album.Because by no means is this a bad album. You still have strong playing anchored by a superior rhythm section moving things along. Scott Benzel's vocals and lyrics complement each other just as well as they had on Machines of Loving Grace and Concentration.So if you are expecting the next step after Concentration you might rate this low or lower. If you aren't and can appreciate it on its own merits you might find yourself a gem of an album that very few have heard."
4,Pretty good mix of old & new Persian music,"I really like this CD. It's a unique blend of traditional (50-60s) and some-what pop-ish Iranian music not heard elsewhere. Contains some nostalgic songs (Zolaykha) reminiscent of pre-79 pop songs, which will appeal to older folks who remember those times (remember Googoosh, Dariush, Koroush Yaghmaie, etc.?)I (being Iranian) and a couple of American friends saw Aldoush perform at Ashkenaz in Berkeley - they thoroughly enjoyed some of the selections on this CD and were very pleased to receive the CD as a parting gift from me (right Frank and Anita?). :)"
2,"Interesting, listen to Goli and the Pomegranet song",I have never heard of Aldoush. He seems to like to sing even though he may lack the true ability to do it well. Good effort though...
5,very cool,I LOVE THIS DOLL BECAUSE SHE IS VERY COOL.I DON'T HAVE HER BUT I WILL GET HER VERY SOON!(...)
1,What a fake!,"Don't buy this! This is fake. It's hollow and it doesn't work as doing real stitches, but you can bead with it. So watch out! Real lanyard string should be flat, heavy, and not hollow. This hollow kind unravels."
5,Still Scorching,"Clear Impetuous morning clearly proves that Jason and the Scorchers are back. The band that invented what is now called insurgent or alt country has created, in this recording, their best work since their heyday in the early and mid-eighties (Fervor and Lost and Found). The previous reunion album, A Blazing Grace, was exciting simply because the godfathers of country rock were back and sounded good. Clear Impetuous morning, their second album since reuniting, shows the masters have returned to teach a new generation of country punks how to rock. The adrenaline packed opener Self-Sabotage sets the pace of the album that rocks, rolls, reels, and twangs itself into one of the best records of the decade. To quote the first line of the first song ""Oh what a rush!"""
4,Deltora Quest,"I think any fan of good old fashion fantasy would enjoy this series/book.Would make a great fantasy movie, overall just great read.why only 4 stars I'm not a five star guy lol, and the fact I am reviewing this book says alot most of the time I just delete those emails ""please review this ...""Bottom line, buy this book, get the other, read them and enjoy this fantsy world.have great day"
3,3 1/2 stars...Exceptional Narration...,"This is an amazing piece, written by Stravinsky. The idea of having narration over and with instrumental music is very cool, and it is somewhat difficult to find recordings of this piece that includes the narration.That being said...this album features an amazing narrator, Jason O'Mara. He is exuberant and alive, and the way he expresses the emotions of the characters is superb. The orchestra, on the other hand, is somewhat lackluster and does not seem to match O'Mara's level of performance intesity. This is not to say the orchestra is bad, but it just seems like there could be a little more feeling put into the playing.Overall, the sound on this album is a little below adequate, having the narration several volume levels below the instrumental interludes.This is album is worth purchasing if you are looking for a version that includes the narration, and it is usually available at a bargain price!"
1,No show and no refund yet,"Ordered May 20th and is June 3rd, no product or refund.Anyone want to loose some money, and time trying to get it back?Just order from these people and don't expect much.Emailed them twice, called Amazon and still waiting......."
4,Worked for over a year.,"The price is right! The home charger worked for about 15 months, then fell apart. The car charger still works. I've had a stupid pink razor for like 2 1/2 years and I've just been too lazy to go pick out a new phone because this one still works and I'm still able to use the car charger. Even though the home charger fell apart I give it 4 stars because.., come on.., it was less than $5 and included a cover and worked for longer than most people keep a cell phone."
4,dems r sum peerty pictures,"90% of Julie's work is stunning. 60% of Boris's work is stunning. By far, Julie is the better artist. Turn to any page and if there is a beautiful picture on it, chances are Julie did it. If the picture looks odd like the person's face or body being deformed, chances are Boris did it. They both have their share of throw away paintings. Some of them are down right terrible. But when they get it right it really is a feast for the eyes. One downfall for this book is the information on the comic characters. Why does it say Storm has gray skin? Like time I checked she was African American and they don't have gray skin. There are a ton of mistakes on the characters but it doesn't really matter since the paintings are why you're buying the book."
4,Nudie suits and Nashville Flash!,"This video rocks! With all the hicksville affectations of the G.O.O. and some pretty flash Nudie outfits, semi-suave goofball Webb Pierce joins humble guitar grandmaster Chet Atkins for a low-down ho-down good time! The extras milling about the set trying to look as sincerely entertained as Miss Minnie Pearl are hilarious (LOVED the sheep!). Look for a young sex pot June Carter Cash sharing hosting duties and at the end, Señor Marty Robbins in tight jeans joins Webb and Carl Smith for a rollicking version of Why Baby Why. The video looks and sounds pretty darn crisp for the footage being as old as it is (its transfered from mid 50's 35mm footage) and the vivid colors will make your eyes throb. There's only occasional dust on the print but you wont really care. Classic stars when they were young and beautiful (well..sorta) makes this disc one to keep! Now if they'd just put out one with Faron Young, i could die a happy gal!"
1,Ventage but not what I had hoped,I was disappointed in this one. It was not what I expected. The thirty plus year old footage was of Chester Atkins. Good ventage footage but not what I had hoped. The best part is seeing a young and beautiful Minnie Pearl seated along side of Chet.
1,Good idea,"Save your moneyThis will not cut toenails, way overpricedYou can not change the clippers, and operatesby a chord [string]Mastermind IDEA. BUT a piece of junk."
2,Toe nipper,Just buy a regular toe nail clpper. This thing looks like some a kid rigged up. It doesn't work very well at the price they are asking.
1,DO NOT BUY THESE,"I have spent over 60 for these toe nail clippers,they are rubbish,they would not cut my toe nails so I tried to cut my finger nails with them,and they could not even do that ,it is fraudulent to sell this product,as it does not work, its badly put together,and my money should be refunded......."
1,Remote Toe Nail Clippers,Good idea but poor execution. The clippers do not cut the nails very well. Really difficult to make good clean cuts. Also has a cheap plastic handle and trigger pull with a string connecting the trigger to the nail clipper. Would be a good idea to be able to interchange better clippers and have an adjustment for tension.Looks like this is about a $5 dollar widget that sells for $70+. Save your money.
2,Remote Toe Nail Clipper,"It works after a fashion, but not well enough to be truly useful. It is simply a regular nail clipper attached to a handle and leverage for working the clipper. As such, it doesn't open wide enough for curved toenails, and simply cannot trim thick, curved nails. Takes a lot more work than it should to make it function about half the time, and gives the impression that someone put in the least amount of thought to make a device that might be truly useful if more attention was paid to its design."
5,What a deal!,"Ok, so it's not Bob Marley's Legend but I saw that there were 47 songs for $8.99. That's a STEAL! This isn't the mainstream collection but it's more of a true fan's must have list. My two month old loves Bob- and Mommy likes that."
3,A Great Handbook for 'Writers' Block',"I saw this book recommended by one of my favorite authors, Michael Cunningham (he wrote THE HOURS). Michael teaches a Creative Writing course at Columbia University and I'm sure he implores his students to read this one. It is an easy, simple read of ""I REMEMBER..."" lines of memories from the 1940s and 1950s. It is a 'must read' for any writer who has writers block as it will spur new ideas into one's head, encouraging one to write their very OWN 'I Remember' lines. I really enjoyed it, relating and laughing several times--I ended up finishing it in one day as a break from another book."
2,Very weak writing. Joe Brainard's lazy prose and tidbits o,"Brainard's prose continues to be lauded. Why? The New York School after O'Hara and Berrigan are awash in ennui and the banal, the boring remberences of schmmootz and who cares. Time to dump the bad writing."
4,worth reading,"I should note, first, that the book I received didn't have a cover that looked anything like the one shown (black and white photo). The one that arrived has art by Joe Brainard as a cover, mostly yellow and a drawing of a young boy walking through a door. This is irrelevant to my scoring, but it might matter to someone.The read is...interesting. Nostalgic, even to someone who grew up in the 90s instead of around Brainards time. I enjoyed it, so it gets 4 stars (I wasn't crazy about it though). It was honest, funny, harrowing, disgusting, disturbing, provoked some introspection...Be warned, this is not exactly for the light of heart, but if you're interested I'd recommend it.Might be the sort of book you want to see if you can find at a library or something before paying full for it, but that's just me."
4,What I think,"Interesting book, with much humour. Something to teach both men and women. Many truths... but people have got to be interested in change to make use of it :). While the information might not apply to every situation, it certainly applies to many. Interesting insights. Recommended. [It might help you to understand and predict your mother-in-law, comprehend emotional blackmail, and cope with real-life issues]"
1,not great,"the Pease audio book on body language is far superior to this. this one just doesn't cut it for me, very weak."
4,LeBra Nose Cover saves your paint!!,"My husband had his 92 Camaro totally fixed and repainted, but the low profile style of the car quickly lead to chips in the beautiful new paint job. He had one of these nose covers on a previous car and loved it, so we bought another one for the Camaro. It works great and looks great!The really nice thing about this brand is the two-piece construction. There's no need to remove the entire thing if you need to get under the hood. It's quick and easy to both install and remove.It may look a bit ""lumpy"" or ""warped"" at first, but quickly molds itself to your vehicle's profile and fits like a glove."
3,review 2,"I found the narrator's style to be more than a little camp, at times quite annoying, and I would hope that someone who was meeting the Aeneid for the first time would NOT buy this rendition, however, as an AP Vergil teacher who reads a translation every year before school starts, it was fine."
5,The Tragedy of Dido,"I read this book while on the beach in East Africa and was blown away. The beautiful descriptions of temples, castles, people, and their motivations for living and dying were incredible. Particularly, the Carthaginian Queen Dido and her disastrous love for Aeneas made me cringe as she cried in death on the fire. Buy this book---it will resonate within you for years."
1,Couldn't get into it,"I think I was way in over my head trying to get into this book. I have read some other ancient texts (Gilgamesh, Odyssey), but those seemed a lot simpler and straight-forward than this. A classic so they say, but so many gods and stories all thrown together...I just couldn't make heads or tails about it."
2,This isn't a book.,"Getting this book is a lot like googling ""Game Design Article"" - you have to do a lot of sifting of your own. Many of these articles aren't even about game design, they're just some story that happens to involve a videogame. Plenty of hot-air articles in here, and the occasional quality article. Why someone would want to have this when they have an internet connection is beyond me. Just go browse Gamasutra and you'll get the same experience."
4,At Last,"Sweet Evil is available on CD. This is the absolute best record Rick Derringer ever made as a leader. Totally overlooked by everyone. All 8 songs from this outing are killer. There are a million guitar hooks on this record alone. Heavy, crunchy, rock and roll tunes with great lyrics. Spring Fever at the beginning of this two fer is totally different except for the opening cut Gimmie More. That song sounds like it could have been from the SE session. Forget the first self titled Derringer album. Get this and wait for Good Dirty Fun, another fairly great RD album. Also, the only greatest hits pack worth getting is The Best of Rick Derringer/Rock-n-Roll Hoochie Koo. Some SE tracks repeated here."
3,Would have been higher if the tapes had been there.,"Listen to what your fellow reviewers are saying about this book! Despite what the title says, without tapes, this is in no way complete!Make sure you ONLY get it if the tapes are available! As far as I can tell, the tapes are no longer available (checking with book distributors such as Baker and Taylor). If you have other good books with tapes, you may find this one helpful, but it isn't top on my list.I've been teaching myself Turkish (slowly, painfully but I'm old!) for months and was excited to see this one, 7th of the books I purchased on this topic. Wish I'd skipped this one in favor of the last one I bought(which was the best!).This book is good if you want to be able to take lessons and quizzes (which I do) but is extremely frustrating without the tapes as many of the exercises refer to the missing tapes.Still glad I have it, but it isn't the best around."
3,Tapes do not come with the book,"The text makes reference to an accompanying cassette but all that comes from Amazon is the book. I have sent a fax to the American distributor at 847-679 2494 and an e-mail to the British distributor orders@bookpoint.co.uk but so far no way to get the tape. The British publisher is Hodder and Stoughton Educational 338 Euston Road, London NW1 3BH The book seems pretty good to me but I haven't been to Turkey yet. It's a tough language."
4,I love the color!,"I just purchased this nail polish in ""Rhinestone Rose"" and it is absolutely stunning. It sparkles and stays very shiny long after the paint has dried. My only problem is the polish chips rather easily, but the stunning color makes up for it!"
3,Better than the last entry,"I enjoyed this episode much more than I did the previous entry in this series. There is not much of a mystery and the author uses a plot that I have read before in another mystery with regards to how the murderer attempts to get by with his/her crime. This particular book is more of a chapter in the life of the village rather than a mystery as more time and words are spent on the daily trials and tribulations of WW II life in small-town England than the mystery itself. I had almost decided not to buy this book after the last one, but am glad I did and will definitely buy the next installment. I do have to say, as I said in my review of the previous book, that once again, there are typos in the book. Berkley Prime Crime, do you not have spellcheck?"
3,"I finished the book, but it's not a great book","My mother lived in England during World War II (married a GI), and I'm a history major, so I know a far amount about this period, but I don't think the author does. It sounds like she threw in a few tidbits and thought that was enough, but I thought she got a fair amount wrong. As to the mystery itself, it was obvious to me about half way through the book what was going on -- so obvious that I thought it had to be a red herring. It wasn't.Still -- this was a pleasant enough book to read, and it held my interest reasonably well. It has a certain charm. I'm told that the other series by this author is better -- I hope so -- I just ordered some books in that series (before I'd read this book). This was simply not the kind of work you'd expect from someone who has published so much -- I wonder if it is an early work that got published after later work was successfully published."
2,Disappointing,"My two-year-old barely looked at this book. She loves lift-the-flap books and loves Pooh, but we found the flaps to be very boring. The book has over 60 flaps, but they reveal nothing intresting. Honey pot standing up becomes honey pot tipped over. Pooh smiling becomes Pooh with no expression. Snoozeville. If I had looked at it in a store, I would never have bought it. I highly recommend instead ""Arthur Goes to School""."
1,A total waste of paper,"I was extremely disappointed in this book. The premise of the book seemed so promising! Gwendolyn Morris's writing was cheesy at best, horribly stilted at worst. I couldn't believe someone would pay her to write. True, short stories do not provide a lot of space to go in depth but it doesn't mean you have to write so far fetched, unrealistic, fake scenerios, with dialogue that is stupid just to fill the page. I would not recommend this book to any thinking person but if you are interested in cotton candy writing, please feel free to pick up this book. Just remember, too much candy can make you sick and possibly rot your teeth."
5,good seller,This book was nicely packed and promptly shipped. Condition better than stated in listing. AAA+++
5,Very Special Book,Alex Scott was a very special girl. Book tells the true story of a amazing Scott family.
5,great cause great book,very accessible story for telling little kids about fatal diseases like cancer.
5,A demonstration of the good just one person can do,"This is the story of an extraordinary little girl. Alexandra Scott was diagnosed with neuroblastoma, a form of cancer, when she was one year old. When she was four, she decided to build a lemonade stand and donate the proceeds to the hospital where she was treated. News of Alex and her goals spread, so that others decided to help her raise money. Now there is a foundation (Alex's Lemonade Stand Foundation) dedicated to continuing her work.Told in a set of delightful rhymes and attractive illustrations, this is a tale that is inspiring and demonstrates how much one person can change the world if they simply try. If you buy this book, you will enjoy it and young children will be delighted to have it read to them. I also encourage you to make a donation to what is truly a worthy cause."
3,Price is for 1 tumbler,"Product description is misleading as it states the item is plural. ""These Classic 14 oz. Unbreakable Polycarbonate Plastic Tumblers"" I would not have purchased one plastic tumbler for $8.48! I was under the impression that I was receiving a set of 4. Glass is nice, just disappointed in the cost!"
4,"Lovely & Practical, but marred by Immortal Glue","These are beautiful glasses. The sides are thinner than some I've had in the past, but the bottoms are thick and the entire piece is clear as glass. However! I'm giving them only 4 stars because that glass-like beauty is spoiled by the glue beneath the two labels. Nothing I tried (hot sudsy water, glass cleaner, even Goo Gone!) could completely remove the albeit clear but greasy residue. Consequently, on opposing sides of each glass are two smeary marks. Steel wool would likely remove them ... them AND the plastic. So, bottom line is, I love 'em but I can't clean 'em!"
3,Polycarb glasses,"I really liked the idea of these for use where breakables are not an option. Found they will break if dropped, although not as readily as glass will. Wish they had been sturdier or what is the point of buying them?"
3,Informative Guide,"I'm not always crazy about these guides, their usefullness is for such a short duration, but I must say that this one is quite well done. It gives you a good idea of what the pieces of this style are going for at the time and what is selling and what is not..again at the time of the auction. The book does a nice job, better than most Millers guides, of giving many examples of different pieces of furniture in each style. The biggest problem with these guides are that they are a bit expensive and obviously go out of date quickly. Once they are more than a few years old they are really not of much use, other than to admire the beautiful furniture in the pictures. Having said that the book is well put together and the pictures are quite nice, though I wish more where in color."
3,Don't try to adjust it!,"I was initially pleased with the cable, which I used to connect a subwoofer to an audio system. It's thin and flexible, and seems to have good fidelity. However, one of the ends held very tightly to the RCA jack on the back of the sub -- so tightly that I had to use a screwdriver to pry it off! ""No problem,"" I thought, ""I'll just use a pair of pliers to bend the tabs out."" Wrong! The connectors are made of cast metal, and the tabs break off easily. So, I now have a worthless cable, unless I want to solder on a new jack."
2,1st Attempt at Literature,Minot Davis is obviously a lost soul who is trying to find himself or justify his existence which is basically alcoholism and using his friends as characters and all of his favorite recognizable places in the Northwest in his books. Would have been better off writing this as an autobiography as well as his second book. Why does this author think that his life is what is interesting instead of coming up with an original thought? Not worth your time.
5,It's the Missing Ramadan Book!,"Most Ramadan books are too difficult to read to my young students and I was missing that perfect book about this holiday. Now I can read them a book the students can enjoy and 1st and 2nd graders can read it on their own too! Thanks for the book, if only it had arrived sooner."
3,A cute introduction to Muslims' fasting month,"Suitable for preschoolers, this book is written from the perspective of the younger sister who is still too young to fast, but notices what her older brother is doing. I'm not very impressed with the illustrations; they make the family look like they are dumb or simple minded."
2,I Don't recommend this book!,"This book you can tell was not written by a muslim. So the way they presented ramadan is dull, yes is simple to read but at least a little love for the month is not shown. No excitement is like just writing facts with pictures. Does not really make it fun for kids.You don't feel the excitement of ramadan with this instead you get few facts that really does not sound like a child explaining ramadan or the eid. Better books out there in this topic. Make sure is written by a muslim. Not trying to be racist but an author who really experience ramadan will really show the excitement and love for the month of ramadan in their writing."
5,Another Wong Kar-Wai masterpiece,"Having seen all of Wong Kar-Wai's previous efforts, I have been waiting in anticipation for ""Happy Together"". And what a magnificent movie it was - both visually and emotionally. No one portrays loneliness, alienation and the pangs of love better than this director and his long-time cinematographer Christopher Doyle. From the opening scene of the blue-tinted Iguazu Falls to the final uproariously upbeat scene of a subway train zooming into its station to the strains of ""Happy Together"", there was never a dull moment; moments that range froms scenes of utter despair, to hysterical quarrels between gay lovers to humorously playful interludes. Scenes alternate between black-and-white and over-saturated color in tandem with the shifting emotions of sadness and happiness. It is a masterpiece of color, sound and emotions which only Wong Kar-Wai could have created."
3,"Stunnigly made, but a story??","This is one of the few movies that i can easily forget about the plot, and concentrate on the visual experience (Belly being another). I find Wong Kar Wai's movies intriguing, and chris doyles camerawork and photography amazing. This film was beautiful, it just lacked a lot in the plot department. But it didn't seem to matter. The things I find best about Wong Kar Wais films are that you never understand them fully until they are over, and he can say so much more without dialogue that any other director, ever."
4,"Great movie, but it's cut","For me personally ""Happy Together"" is one of the best asian and one of the best lovemovies ever made. Sure, if you don't like or hate gay people, this is not your movie....I am not homosexual, but the way Wong-Kar Wai shows the relationship between these two guys, is very intimate and i think, it has something for gay and not-gay people.The sad thing is, there is over one minute missing in the US-DVD! I own the HK-DVD and there you can see a really cool black and white scene with the two fantastic tango-dancers and also a scene, where Tony Leung buys something to drink+eat...whatever. It may sound not so special, but i think it's always bad, when there's something cut. That's why i give this DVD ""only"" 4 stars. By the way, the picture and the sound quality are really good."
1,Unhappy Viewing,"As a gay Asian man, I always anticipate a gay Asian film that steers away from the cliche subjects of pimps and hustlers and young men involved with older men for purely economic reasons. It's refreshing that the two lovers in ""Happy Together"" are supposed to be involved with each other for love. The problem with ""Happy Together"" is that their love is never depicted. For the duration of the film, the viewer is presented with a melange of arguments, fights, and temporary separations that ultimately lead to the final break-up. What binds this couple when it seems that both men - from beginning to end - loathe each other more so than love? No doubt ""Happy Together"" is a finely shot film. However, the lingering question of ""What the hell?"" far outweighs the film's glossiness. And when the credits roll, the viewer is left with no sense of a redeeming quality for having sat through this ordeal."
1,Unbelievably Bad,"If slow, dull storytelling featuring utterly unfathomably characters who are hell-bent on self-flagellation is your cup of oolong, you'll love this. Otherwise, don't waste a second of your life watching it."
1,On my 10 WORST list,This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. If I hadn't read the reviews posted here I would have had NO idea what was going on. Actually I STILL have NO idea what was going on. TOTAL waste of time and money.
4,Stunning visuals for this fresh-take on romance.,"Yes, we all know the story of on-again-off-again romance. But, this fresh take by Wong Kar-wai on romance comes alive, transposed to the dark tango salons of Buenos Aires. The ups and downs of a Hong Kong couple (gay), is hypnotically filmed by cinematographer Doyle. A landmark in both Wong's and Doyle's careers. The tension in the couple is all the more compelling as they find themselves caught in a foreign world."
5,Yet another rave,"I was not at all familiar with any of the films of Wong Kar-wai prior to seeing the video of ""Happy Together"". The film was a wonderful surprise ... it completely bowled me over! I was engrossed in the story of the gay Chinese couple trapped in a doomed relationship halfway around the world from their home. Add the first-rate acting, direction and cinematography, and you have one hell of an entertaining film. There is nothing that I can add to the more knowledgeable reviews below. But I can say that it is always satisfying to recommend a great film to your friends ... ""Happy Together"" is one of those films."
4,Great little cabinet,This cabinet fits perfectly in our small bathroom. It is nice looking and has a great finish. It was however a bit tedious to put together.Overall a good product.
4,Well-shot independent feature with a unique story.,"This movie packs an emotional punch. The tripped-out, drug-amped characters -portrayed by Jason Allen Wolfe, Eli DeGeer, and Amanda Booth - are entangled in a web of deceit and sexual enslavement. The story is represented beautifully with a mix of sexual and horrifying visuals coupled with well-acted roles that embody the downward spiral of drug and sex addictions. The directing combination of low-budget movie veteran Eric Stanze (SAVAGE HARVEST, ICE FROM THE SUN, SCRAPBOOK) and relative newcomer Robin Garrels (INSANIAC) lends to a new look for independent movies. The music score used, also adds to the whole experience, helping to immerse you in this twisted maze of a story. I have watched this movie several times and it holds up each time I watch it. I highly recommend this movie."
1,Honestly,"The only forgivable mistake of this movie was the quasi-Lynch, highly stylized, rippage during the montage/porno scenes, and the general story-line, which, I am sure any other director would have pulled off. Big E.S. did not pull it off, however; rather, he took it, played with it, ran with it, then ultimately farted on it. Farted all over it.The acting was par, a change for a Stanze film. The twist ending was contentious and ill-performed. The audio/visual of this film was the stuff of a first year film student.I can not recommend this in good faith."
4,empower your workout,"For anyone who likes to move their body, challenge their heart, and open their mind."
1,Not what I expected,"This is too different for my taste, I was very disappointed with the instructor and the program. This just wasn't something I'd recommend to anyone."
4,Be prepared for lots of SQUATS!,"This video workout has lots and lots of squats, so please be prepared for that! and I meant ALOT!Usually I get sore muscles the 2nd day prior to the workout, but after I did this video, I immediately noticed that my gluts are sore... and the next day was even worse...Aslo, the entire workout was done in a very fast speed with full range of motion, so safety is also something you want to watch out when you are doing it."
3,"5 stars for core, stability and sweat, minus 2 for bulky thighs","There are a lot of good things about this workout - original moves, a focus on functional fitness, awesome core stability work and enough intensity to really sweat. Unfortunately, the cardio section relies SO heavily on variations of lunges and squats that I had to subtract 2 stars. My knees were swollen and sore after that section, and I found myself longing for a more balanced effect. Why not up intensity by adding some upper body, too? Plus, the last part of my body where I need to add more bulk is my thighs. Check out the exercisers in the video - it looks to me like they have over-developed their quads and hams. No thanks. I would do this again for the great dynamic stablity moves and the exciting, different style, but it won't be a regular in my routine."
4,"SPST Toggle Switch, old school","This SPST toggle switch does exactly what you think it will, it turns electricity on and off. The only problem I have with it are the screw terminals. Traditionally, screw terminals are attached to a plate with raised corners, and you bend the wire into a hook shape, the raised corners hold the wire, and the screw traps the wire against the corners to form a cup. This switch skipped that. It is really difficult to use this terminal without a crimp on end. You want to crimp the smallest ring onto your wire, then remove the screws, and stick them through the ring when you reattach them.And that loses it a star. You can solder stranded wire into a ring and use it with this terminal, which is what I did since I didn't have a ring or spade handy, but I didn't like it."
2,Quality Control System is Broken,"First of all, I like the product functionality, price, and value. However, when I received my original order, the switch arrived in three pieces, as the plastic housing was broken. I returned to Amazon and received a replacement. This one had both tabs on the faceplace all bent up and turned over. In both cases, the packaging was not damaged, so it is apparent that the faulty switches were shipped in this condition. This company definitely needs to shore up its quality control system and to assure that defective parts are not shipped to the customer."
1,"Principia is wonderful, this book is NOT Principia.","There are lots of multi-paragraph reviews on this item, which are reviewing how wonderful is the work that is Principia Mathematica. That's nice.... I wonder if any of the people here bought THIS COPY of the book.Let me warn you as to what you are going to receive....You'll receive the middle of the book. Chapters 3-5 to be exact. You're also paying good money for a scanned copy of a nearly 100-year old work. It is poorly cropped, with smudges everywhere, and many unreadable characters/sections.I purchased this to enjoy the challenge of the work, as the material itself is quite substantial. However part of that ""challenge"" should not be trying to determine one smudged symbol from another.It would also be nice to receive the beginning of the book (?) sort of a given that if you purchase something called ""Principia Mathematica"" - that one would receive the entire work."
1,Warning -- Don't Buy General Books LLC Version,I haven't read Whitehead and Russell yet; I received the General Books print to order gibberish today and will be mailing it back to Amazon tomorrow. Don't they realize what they're selling? Garbage! I will strive not to make this mistake again!
1,The wrong volume of the obsolete first edition,"The Principia Mathematica is a very important three-volume work, but if you order this product you might be sent, as I was, only the third volume. Nothing in the advertisement leads the buyer to expect this. You should also know that that the second edition contains important additions that make it preferable to the first; the volume I was sent was from the first edition."
3,just a heads up about the nabu edition.,"Me and My girlfriend, we are into philosophy and such, she wanted Principia Mathematica for a long time, she loves logic. I ordered and bought the book for her birthday.but just a heads up!I chose the nabu edition [with the clock on the cover] believing it was including all volumes , but I was wrong, this is volume III and I don't see any other vol. by nabu, which would help me complete the entire set. don't be fooled by this published edition. the cover is not specifying much either, nor it's details. this led me to a regretful confusion. Where I live the book isn't available and knowing how pricey it is, then I had no other choice but to buy it online. if you're going to buy one, for starters, go pick the one that says to *56 on the cover. don't be fooled by this version. not that is a bad thing, but it's just isn't enough nor satisfactory."
5,A monument of mathematical logic,"This book is the ultimate attempt to derive all of mathematics from logic while avoiding paradoxes of the sort that Russell himself sprang on Frege--and in passing, it gives in rigorous symbolic form Russell's ""theory of descriptions.""Just as Bach took the baroque style of music about as far as it could go, Russell and Whitehead took this attempt to put mathematics on a firm logical footing about as far as it could go (and Goedel's incompleteness theorem killed off the hopes that mathematicians such as Hilbert had for the goal). Nevertheless, like any really good problem, it turned up worthwhile byproducts.Alas, my exposure to the full three-volume set is confined to time spent at a university library; I could only afford the paperback volume of the first fifty-six chapters. I hope to eventually buy a copy of this classic work in its entirety."
5,This book is a masterpiece of Mathamatics. Extreamly good.,"This is an extreamly good book with more information than you could poke a stick at. I got left behind a few times and had to re-read a chapter, but as long as you love ADVANCED math and like to think logicaly, this book is for you. It goes into many areas of math in general as well as dozens of spacific areas and provides more than enough information. It is a very ""deep"" book and can sometimes be a bit diffucult to understand, and i recoment this book to people who love deep, deep thought. It is not for everybody, in fact it is probibly for very few, but thouse who read and understand it, will come to love and value it..."
5,A Famous Failed Enterprise,"The Principia was Russel and Whitehead's famous attempt to axiomise all of mathematics. Godel's famous theorem demolished it, proving that such an enterprise was impossible.This book is an important step in mathematical history and a brilliant demonstration of the power of logic, but in the end of interest only to logicians for historical reasons."
4,good Pi 5 release,"I like this album for listening in the car when I am driving. There are some slow parts on this one that I wish that weren't there ^mainly rock and roll^.My favorites on here are The Night is Still Young; Happy Sad; CDJ; Peace Music (actually St. Etienne Remix); Strawberry Sleighride; and Airplace. The biggest problem that friends have with this CD is the fact that there are only a few English songs on here. I reccomend that you get Happy End of the World if you want an Pizzicato Five release with english on it. For those of you who do like to listen to Japanese music, this one is a good one for the collection. Although I won't say that it is a must have."
3,Only for the P Fi collector,"I liked the album, don't get me wrong. But if this had been the first Pizzicato Five album I had heard, I would've never purchased more. All in all, not as good as 5th release or Happy End of the World (the only two I have for comparison)."
4,"Good movie, good soundtrack","I saw Pi. They say scientists do their genius work in their twenties, as do mathematicians. Pi is a genius work of a young director in my opinion, with all parts of the film fresh and raw. In any case, the film was great. The youth and learning curve of the director only made it better.This soundtrack reflects a similar mood to the movie. Check out the Gus Gus track, as well as Clint Mansell's admirable beat-riding. Orbital is good as always; the other artists offer new and eye-opening jams for newcomers to electronica.Try to listen to ""2PiR"" and not dance! I defy you! And stick around for the rest of it too, you will be glad you did."
5,MMM...Pi,"Unlike most soundtracks, this album manages to seamlessly mix music produced especially for the film with licenced tracks. Whats more the original tracks outshine most of the old stuff on here by a long way. The first three tracks fit together so well you barely notice the joins and the whole first half races by. The second half tales off slightly with only the Clint mansell tracks standing out. This album acts as a good sampler for the artists featured on it and has led to me buying more stuff by Autechre, Aphex Twin and Roni Size. However I would say it should be lisened to before you buy it as most of my friends refuse to be in the same room as it, even though they are electronic music fans."
5,Pi sountrack - best electronic music of 1998,"Pi was the best independent movie of 98, and was driven by a truely phenominal soundtrack. If you like electronic music, this is the record for you. With the likes of Clint Mansell (of Pop Will Eat Itself), Aphex Twin, Roni Size, Spacetime Continuum, and Orbital just to name a few. I got the record before I saw the movie. The music stands alone, but when you see the film it means so much more to you. Creepy visuals from the black and white movie run through your head each time you listen to the music. A truely great record. Rated #1 electronic record of 1998 at my radio station.Larry Leone rpm md kmnr 89.7 fm"
2,eh...i thought it was going to be better than expected.,"Well first off the CD did not come in a case (not even a CD sleeve) but thats the least of problems. The CD was not impressive as a whole. There was only 2 good songs on that CD, which sadly (I think) were the ones they kept playing on the movie I guess, because thats the reason I bought it. Anyways.......you win some, you lose some....I consider this one a loss."
1,ha!,"i cannot believe the hyperbolic praise this nonsense has garnered. this is nothing but a shallow ""now that's what i call electronica"" cd stocked with the most obvious NME friendly middle of the road, adult-oriented-techno. it could have been compiled by a database application. i guess it all makes sense when you realise POP WILL EAT ITSELF had something to do with it. HA! POP WILL EAT ITSELF ...nought wrong with popularism, but judging by the praise this crud has got, you'd think it's up there with stockhausen or sun ra, when frankly it's not even ""up there"" with bloody moby...dig a little deeper and you may find gold."
5,Rusty And Buttons,I am not sure that the cartoon was called Chucklewood Critters. All I remember is Rusty and Buttons. The cartoons are the same as they were when I grew up. This dvd is jammed packed with cute stories for children. These cartoons allow children to be children. Very nice product.
4,Some Stats,"This is from a Fluke 75III meterSignal induction/crosstalk between conductors = unmeasureable.Signal loss on 2 data wires = ~.05 Ohms from pin to pin.Signal loss on 2 (distinct) ground wires = ~.06 Ohms, pin to pin.Solder joints (while not entriely pretty) are not cold/flawed in any visible way.The individual ground shielding at one end of my cable was close to contact, but was not touching.Overall i'm pleased..."
5,They stand behind their products,"I had a pair of these cables for approximately 2 years when i noticed there was a frayed end where the connector started to come off. I didn't notice any change in performance but I recalled that ALL Monster Cable ""wires"" have a lifetime warranty. I thought I'd try and take advantage of their claim and low and behold, I easily made arrangements to have a new one exchanged. It took only a week of waiting (back and forth shipping, mind you) and I had a brand spanin' new cable in my possesion. Great customer service!!!"
2,I am unable to verify its ultra high performance,"~I bought the MVSV3-1m cable and put it between my Pioneer V555 DVD player and SONY WEGA tv KV-27FS12, I was unable to see with my naked eyes any improvement regading the visual quality, color, sharpness. Same as the result as I used the composite cable came with the box. I really don't know why. I have to say, my TV is a good one and the picture quality is already satisfactory even I don't use DVD player. Unfortunately my DVD player does not have component jack to let me try the next level video~~ experience. I don't want to say this expensive cable is a poor one, I was just unable to verify its alledged ultra high performance. we just don't have a benchmark to evaluate it.~"
3,There was a change?,"I attached both these S-Video Cables and the standard Red-White-Yellow (RCA) cables from the DVD player directly to the television. Being on different extensions, this allowed me to switch back and forth from the S-Video to the standard cables on the T.V. to see if there was any change in video quality. Sad to say, there was no change at all. Both pictures looked great. That's the only reason why I'm giving this 3 stars. If you want a really good picture, then buy HDTV and a really expensive DVD player with cables that have blue and green connectors instead of S-Video or yellow."
3,Bad pins.,"I bought this cable used, when I received the cable the pins were all bent. I sorta thought they would have checked it when they shipped it. However they gave me full refund and were very nice about taking care of me. Thanks,"
5,Not Available,"I ordered this from Amazon in May, it took until September to be notified that it isn't available any more. Why they didn't take the obvious next step and stop offering it is beyond me.The star rating is for the artistic merit, not consumer information."
3,Not Bad,Not a bad book. I enjoed it. This was the first book by Ms. Crosby that I have read.I will be srue to check out other books of hers that I come accross.
1,Stinks,"I've enjoyed Crosby's books in the past. I tried to read this one on an airplane, and just couldn't get past the first 50 pages. It was, however, the only book I had with me, so rather than read the in-flight magazine, I tried again after my peanuts. Still, I couldn't get past the bad dialogue and the rather immature characters. Pass on this one."
2,Weak orchestra,"Well, I give the conductor points for trying, but this is not a blockbuster orchestra, nor an underrated one. It is mostly just weak, particularly in the brass, which sounded like they were offstage or something. Percussion and strings were very loud, the interpretation was alright, but nothing about this recording screamed ""Shostakovich"" at me. If there's one thing Shostakovich did well, it was making a symphony scream at you, and this one fails."
4,Great mixes but too short for me,"This time, LeAnn brings us her second single after the greatest dance hit ""can't fight the moonlight""The mixes are great but they are edits only. My favorite remixers (thunderpuss, hex hector) are not there..... but there are still some good dance tunes, my recommendation is track 4, Dataluxe Club mix edit, very dancable.Track listing1. Graham Stock Radio Edit 3.492. Almighty Mix Edit 3.423. Dave Aude Radio Edit 4.234. Dataluxe Club Mix Edit 5.45I hope the maxi single will be released with more remixes and full versions."
3,Not what I expected.,"I do a lot of purchasing on Amazon, and always read reviews. I don't know how I missed the 2 previous reviews for this book. I was looking for 3D photos of the war, I didn't realize this book was aimed at collectors and providing information regarding the series of steroviews that were issued covering war.It's my fault entirely, so I can't hold it against the book."
2,Blu-ray Hell,My family loves the movies (when we can view them)! All the blu-ray versions will not play on the Samsung BD5700 player.Let me rephrase this. You can play one of the disks but then the remaining disks will stick on the Disney castle page. I called Samsung for a resolution and they claim an updated firmware was required. I installed the update and was able to view the disks (ONCE). Afterwards the same issue occured.The only workaround is to unplug the Samsung unit to clear something in the unit. Afterwards you can view only 1 of the blu-rays before the issue occurs again.Why does Disney have to make this such an issue?
3,Lion King Triliolgy,I am big kid. I love this movie and it is really awesome on Blue ray.My kids love it as well. The older kids enjoy it because the used to watch when they were younger. Its a whole new movie for my youngest.
3,Review of the actual case - not the movie themselves,"We all know the movies are great and I know there are plenty of reviews on the case itself. I still decided to create a review so Disney or whoever, if information like this actually makes it anywhere, that the case is horrible. I don't like it personally, but the biggest disappointment was it didn't even come properly packaged. There is a slit for each movie and some discs weren't even in a slit by themselves, they were next to another movie. Luckily nothing was damaged. The black string that is suppose to help pull out the drum wasn't behind the drum, so I had to carefully pull the drum out. I guess no big deal, but it's someone's job to make sure the equipment is packaged correctly so nothing breaks and someone failed to do their job."
3,"Great original film, but the packaging lets down this set","The original film is great, the transfer is also good - The film on it's own is a 5 star.The other films don't quite live up to the original, but are fun none the less.What is disappointing with this set and hence only the 3 stars1) The lack of digital copies for the latter two films if you see the Toy Story or Cars sets, all films in the set came with digital copies - This might not be an issue to everyone, but in this digital age, putting the films on a iPad et al, is very useful for trips.2) The way the discs were packaged, they were `clumped together' and sitting vertically in the `drum'. Not only could this be damaging to the discs over time, this was a complete waste of space."
3,Lion King 3d,This is a nice set for lion king fans but the 3d is just not that great there are only a couple good 3d scene and the rest of the move just slightly better to the same as if I up-converted a 2d to 3d.
4,A little dissappointed,"The first time we watched it the quality was amazing, the second time the blur ray did not work. My kids and I have always been huge fans of The Lion King."
5,The Lion King Trilogy,Really neat presentation here folks. Good quality boxes with 8 disc. What more could any Lion King fan want. Hope you enjoy it as much as I do. Thanks from down under!
3,Good if you want all 3 movies but overpriced,"We love all 3 Lion King Movies and thats why we bought this, however it is to me way overpriced. I don't have a blue ray player or 3d playerso the blue ray and 3d movies included do nothing for me... feel like I am paying for stuff I don't need. It has Lion King 1 , 1 1/2, and 2. The movies are great but as someone else posted that I agree is that the movies don't even come in individual cases... for that much money I expect more. Maybe if I would of spent more time I would of bought each one individually somewhere and gotten a better deal but the movies are great and my kids wanted them"
3,Worst Dimond Edition Yet,"This is one of Disney's worst Diamond Editions yet. You would think for as much as Disney is charging for the set they would make sure that all the bonus features are available to all owners. To access most of the classic features you have to be connected to the internet and get BD-Live. There are no games or activities on the movies. I think Disney should have worried less about putting Lion King in 3D and paid more attention to bonus features. If this is the best animated movie of all time I would think Disney could have come up with more features, or at least included all the classic features.I am giving this release a 3 star because the movies look great despite the lack of features. By the way for those of you wondering, the Lion King is the original theatrical release. In order to see the Morning Report you have to go to bonus features."
2,Very disappointed....,"Very disappointed in this set. Not the box it comes in, not in the cardboard african ""drum"" that the dvd's are in.... but in the packaging of the actual dvd's. They are essentially packaged in an accordian file folder, easily scratched if you're not careful. And they don't have soft lining behind them, basically you're resting the dvd on a piece of cardboard. For what you pay for this, it could be packaged better. I only wanted movies in Blu-Ray, it's the only way I can get 1 1/2 and II. Calling Amazon now, to return. I'll wait for 1 1/2 and II to be released seperately, they will eventually."
2,Accordion file folder case is a disappointment,"The 'accordion file folder' disc case is terrible. I bought this version in large part to get the Blu-Ray of Lion King 1.5, which does not appear to be individually available. LK 1.5 is surprisingly entertaining for a Disney sequel. But the case inside the drum.... awful."
2,overweighted product,"I don't think this product is any better than the last edition (platinum edition) which contains a hardcover book with some sketches that I call it collectible. Other than that, the package is overweighted and it's almost empty inside except the discs... I don't find it necessary to make it that big as a collection."
1,Review of the actual case - not the movie themselves,"I love The Lion King trilogy, I have no complaints about the movies. This review is reviewing the box set it comes in.The outside of the box is very lovely, with wood-like carving imagery on the outside. But once you open the case it comes in, you are in for a disappointment. The discs are in thin cardboard! There are no cases to hold the discs. You just slide them out of their ""file"" type thin cardbard. I can see this set getting very scratched in the near future if you watch these a lot. I only bought this set because I wanted all 3 movies. I suggest everyone wait and buy each separately in a appropriate blu ray case release. I would have rather had all three movies in actual blu ray cases inside this nice box, than this cheap, crappy drum. I expected much more, Disney..."
3,Pretty but cheap looking,"This necklace is meant for a 10-year old, which is the only reason why I will let its cheap look slide. The stone itself looks very pretty, and so does the arrangement and design, but the silver part looks really unattractive."
3,Great light but emits plastic smell after a few hours,"This is a great task light, the best I've had, but after a few hours, it starts to emit a smell like hot plastic. It makes me paranoid that it might be toxic, but I don't know that it is. Wish I knew about it beforehand."
4,Highly ecomment it!,"Though it is expensive, it worth the money I paid for it!My eyes are sensitive and feel source easily, 3M table light helps me focus on my reading without disturbed by obtacle uncomfortable."
4,Nice lamp but not bright enough,"This lamp is very well designed. I really like it. It is well balanced. The power button actually has a tiny glowing LED indicator which makes it excellent for using as a bedside lamp. Its easy to turn on in the dead of night!So, I used this as a bedside lamp. The folding was extremely nice, you could easily swing it back away from the bed and out of the way. I was able to read for longer periods of time than usual without my eyes bothering me.The only negative was that I felt that it was not bright enough. I guess you can't have a very bright anti-glare lamp, perhaps its a contradiction in terms. But still, I felt that I would have preferred a slightly brighter lamp. Over time this feeling diminished, perhaps it was just ""habit"" that made me think it was not bright enough.Overall I'm very pleased with it and I can recommend it."
5,Three Cheers and Two Thumbs Up,"I am loving this lamp to death. I spend a lot of time sitting at my home office desk looking at and reading documents late into the evening. Before this lamp I was using a desk lamp that I got at Office Supply. You know, the kind you see everywhere. I had a lot of headaches and I knew it was because of eyestrain, but I forget myself and don't rest my eyes like I shouldWell, after a few days (and nights) with this lamp and that eyestrain is gone. I'm able to get more work done, I sleep better and now it's going on a month and I'm pleased to report that those headaches are gone, so three cheers, two thumbs up and fives stars for this nifty lamp."
5,Love the strength of the light without irritation to the eyes,"This lamp has been a fantastic supplement to our lighting in the livingroom. We love the fact that it's light enough to move around quickly, as needed, unless some other lamps with heavy basis and restricted swivel arms.Both of us routinely work on our laptops, and the lamp provides adequate lighting for every day tasks including computer work and reading. It feels very light, but seems rather robust in build.One of the best aspects of this lamp is the fact that it is very strong but still does not irritate the eyes, like regular office neon lights. A great product for busy professionals seeking a lamp that can be hidden at will!"
4,"Quite comfortable for eyes, but little short.","I have been looking for bright and eye-friendly task lamp for a long time.Actually, this is not exactly what I would like to buy. The task lamp that I want to buy, Finelux sells only East Asia.I do not know why 3M sells Finelux brand task lamp in the US.This is my alternative option. It is quite comfortable for eyes due to polarizing filter.Some users pointed out its brightness, but I think it is much brighter than other lamps.The only thing that I do not satisfy from this is height. It could be better for my desk if it is taller than now.All things considered, it is very good option for students and office workers."
2,After 2 years lamp burned plastic above bulbs,"Would not recommend this product. On the plus side, it is a good task lighting lamp (worth 5 stars). However, the heat from the lamp burned (roasted) the plastic/ceramic above the bulb after about two years of use. The engineers in China have yet to make a decent task lighting lamp. The heating problem could possibly be corrected by an air vent to dissapate overheating. I am very surprised that a company like 3M who sells the product does not realize this."
1,Film around bulbs melted!,"I'm a full-time proofreader, so my work requires excellent lighting. I enjoyed using the 3M glare-reducing task light for the last three years: it definitely reduces eye strain and provides a very crisp and balanced light. I was completely satisfied until I started smelling burning plastic this week. The white film around the bulbs had melted! How long have I been unwittingly breathing in these fumes?! It's simply not worth the health risk to buy this lamp again."
5,Truly Useful & Enjoyable Light,"I work on my computer most of the day and was looking for a better light that would make my eyes more relaxed and less dry. The lights are very expensive, but when I saw one this one on a lightening offer I quickly ordered it. I am really glad I did. In fact I'm waiting for a second offer for another room! The lamp was easy to set up and I placed it toward the front of my desk. The arm and flexibility of the light made it a cinch to light up the work area whether it's the computer or a writing place. With the lamp at the front of the desk I'm easily able to swing it over any reading material I'm studying from my chair. I just love working under this light, my eyes feel so much better and I find myself wanting to move to my workspace where ever I am in the house to read comfortably."
3,Contains mercury! I refused to use it more than once!,"This item was relatively easy to put together. It came in a box with a screw. You put the bottom to the rest of the lamp and screw the bottom to the lamp and it is together. While trying to adjust the light, I knocked in some plastic panel. The plastic panel said the lights CONTAIN MERCURY. Isn't mercury a health concern? In any case, I placed the lamp in my bedroom because before bed I liike to do crossword puzzles, read, and do other stuff. The lamp gives just a little bit of additional light to make those tasks easier.I like that the head of the light is flexible. I like that the lamp looks stylish, but I would not buy this lamp on my own. Why in the world would I buy a lamp that uses mercury bulbs when they sell lamps that use regular bulbs?"
5,Beware the Big Chill,"The aging of America has been in the news for the last few years but most stories only deal with the impact on the social security system. What people don't realize is that as boomers age they will also have a great impact on the real estate and financial markets as they sell their homes and assets so they can have a comfy retirement. The scenarios provided are compelling enough to make your heart sink. But this is not an alarmist book, they openly state that their scenarios are just hypothetical and many things can happen in the intervening years to mitigate the effects of the ""Big Chill"". Plus they provide some tips on how you can make money in the coming years by predicting which industries will get hot. If you want to read a very common sense book about the future of the American economy, this is it."
4,Almost excellent,"I love this book but the reason i gave this book 4 stars is just because they didn't bother to correct some mistakes of the seventh edition. In this edition (eighth), on page 41 (Chapter 7) Botton note says: Pseudomonas aeruginosa {endotoxin} has the same mode of action. Refering to Diphtheria toxin. It should be {exotoxin}. Another example (to show you a few) is in the same chapter on page 43 table 7-13, it says:Nervous systemGram-positive rods:Clostridium tetani>>>>inhibit acetylcholine releaseClostridium botulinum>>>>inhibit glycine releaseAs you can see they are mismatched.So this book is almost perfect, excellent contents but with a few mistakes in some concepts."
4,To Benning and back to tell all,"Monroe Mann's ""To Benning and Back: The Making of a Citizen Soldier"" is an honest portrait of the United States Army's Basic Training at Fort Benning and the New York Army National Guard's Officer Candidate School at Camp Smith. Military literary sketches are often crowded with heroic jargon and feats of super hero performances, whereas, LT Mann's story tells of the heartache and uncertainty a soldier feels while undergoing some of the toughest training in the military. He holds nothing back. Not even the heroic jargon and super hero feats. This is Monroe's honest story of his ups and downs, his highs and lows, his good decisions and his bad. ""To Benning and Back..."" should be required reading for anyone considering the Army National Guard's Officer Candidate School.Hooah,Rudy"
4,"10 more weeks of shining brass, then this place can kiss my","I read Monroe's book trying to trigger memories of my own boot camp days at Fort Polk in the 70's. It's amazing he found the time to write a journal during basic training. Most of the entries are short. One might think, Good Lord, he's a moron, but consider it was written standing up, tired, and scribbled in a hurry. If you've been through basic, you know. Someone who hasn't been through the green machine might think less of this writer. I relived my experience reading his cryptic passages. He captures the up and down emotions, the regret, the pride, and the struggles of boot camp. Although not as eloquent as Jerry Morton's book, it's an equally honest portrayal of boot camp in the Army."
5,"so this is the Army! Well, Basic and OCS anyway....","This book was terrific! It was easy to read (less than 4 hours), and FULL of information. Mr.Mann, I mean, LT Mann is also VERY entertaining. My first thought upon finishing the book was, ""OH MY GOD I NEED TO RUN MORE."" The flow of his thoughts has certainly given me a PRECIOUS inside view of BCT and OCS. I'm fairly certain his warnings will help me weather the toughest spots, from sleep deprivation to taking non-sensical seeming orders from seeming idiots. I'm sure there's a method to the madness, but whatever else, LT Mann has warned me of the madness. Give this book to those you love who are heading for BCT and OCS, and then READ IT YOURSELF. And SEND MAIL TO THEM!"
4,Why buy the import?,"This import has the same music on it as the domestic ""Amazing Steel Guitar: The Buddy Emmons Collection"". Both are reissues of the landmark recording session that Buddy Emmons did in NYC. It's great music, but why pay extra for the import? ""Amazing Steel Guitar"" also includes some additional Nashville tracks from the same era. It's the better buy."
4,A great magazine. I'm always looking forward to reading it every month.,There are always some useful tips on training in there.Aldo you almost have to sort them out between all the advertisements.But if you like to see adds about the latest tri-gear and bikes. Then they won't bother your that much.
1,Still waiting for my subscription.,I ordered my subscription back in Nov and still waiting for my first issue. Very disapointed.
5,Great color!,This is a great nail polish color. It's perfect for summer! The polish just glides on and stays on.
5,exceptional compilation,"Today video making has become an art. At the forefront of the medium are Björk's videos.Unlike the standard videos on MTV, Björk's videos focus on creative images, senarios, humor, and emotion. The directors of Björk's video's read as a who who of the industry. This compilation is a s must for anyone into Björk, her music, or video directing as an art-form.Seeing Volumen will show you the possiblities of video, but beware MTV will forever pale in comparison."
5,Bjork is the Queen of Modern Videos!,"This is the essential collection of Bjork and her video genius! Aside from Madonna, it is hard to name another artist who has used the music video movement to shape their artistry and expand the limits of the norm.It is hard to choose a favorite Bjork video, since they are all so magnificent and finely crafted. I'd have to say ""Bachlorette"" is the tops, though. The play within a play within a play concept really captures your attention and doesn't let go. Honorable mentions go to ""Possibly Maybe"" (beautiful, rich colors), ""All Is Full of Love"" (ahead of its time), ""Army of Me"" (outrageous scenery/props), ""Pagan Poetry"" (dirty lil Bjork getting pierced and masking sex acts into linear animation), ""I Miss You"" (Bjork vs. Looney Tunes!) and of course ""Human Behavior.""If you are even slightly interested in Bjork's music, then this will blow you away!"
5,A must have for all creative people in the world,"This is a wonderful video! I first got hooked on Bjork when I saw the ""It's all so quiet"" video. But with this video collection, not only do get that video you also get to see the rest of her creative and great videos. Like I have said, this video is recommended for anyone with an open and creative mind to music. It is a must have for everyone!"
5,A wonderfull collection of videos from a talented woman.,"For all of Bjorks fans who can't see hervideos frequently because she's not ""mainstream"",Volumen is a must have!!! Volumen features some of the hottest video directors around Michael Gondry,Stephane Sednaoui & Jean-BaptisteMondino.Through their vision, they have captured the very life spark of Bjork's music for our enjoyment."
5,Masterpiece!,"Being a relatively new Bjork fan, I cannot tell you how much you need to purchase this DVD if your support in her music is wavering. After viewing Volumen, I was convinced that she truly is a unique artist that is constantly tossing her audience little crumbs of truth about what she loves, and what's real. It's as if with Volumen, Bjork has prepared for us a feast, and laid it out on the table for all to enjoy. My personal favorites visually are ""Possibly Mabye"" and ""Bachelorette"". Though the lyrics are wonderful on both, the presentation really stood out and were directed with perfection. Lyrically, I love ""Joga"", such a beautiful song. The rest are amazing, so buy this DVD, you don't have to think about it! It's a feast, go ahead and eat already!!"
4,Bjork's Best,"I don't really have much to add here. The other reviews seem to sum up my feeling about this DVD. My only complaint is the lack of attention given to the Main Menu. It just gives the listing of the contents of the DVD with the ability to hear the Vespertine vids in 5.1(which is awsome by the way). I would have liked to see the little duck floating along the screen as it does on her website,or some other kind of animation. A bit of music here would have also helped. ""Frosti"" would have sounded nice here. The sound is very good,if not excellent. All of her videos are nothing short of classics. If you are a Bjork fan or not, you will enjoy this DVD."
5,I hate videos. I love this piece of work,"My old roommate had this DVD. I watched it, then I invited friends over to watch it, then more friends, until I had no more friends to invite. It's so good--good like going to a great film, good, or like going to a great exhibit or installation, good. I own only one DVD and this is the one.I used to listen to The Sugar Cubes in highschool. I liked Bjork but never had her albums until I saw this DVD. Then I realized she was genius."
5,"Amazing, Inspired, timeless","I welcome someone to suggest a better collection from any Pop star in the last decade. Madonna has surely seen this collection and I'm sure was completely humbled.This is art music, accessable to all, with art imagery.I can watch these videos over and over again.Joga, Venus as a boy, Oh so quiet, State of Emergency, Hidden Place.These alone are worth the entry fee."
5,Genius,"To bad ""Alarm Call"" and ""All is Full of Love"" are not included. AIFOL is absolutely the best video of all time. This compilation shows off the combined genius of Bjork and her video directors. ""Possibly Maybe"" was a surprise because I never thought it was released as a single. ""Hunter"", ""Joga"", ""Play Dead"", ""Army of Me"",and ""Big Time Sensuality"" are my favorites. But all pale in comparison to ""All is Full of Love""."
4,Icy Magic,"This DVD should please fans of the Icelandic pop goddesses quirky videos. It's basically the whole of the original 'Volumen' with newer videos from the 'Vespertine' era and two previously unreleased clips.Personally, I still feel that Bjork's music is complimented best by the work of French director Michel Gondry, who helms classic videos like 'Human Nature' and 'Bachelorette.' Most of the newer vids have an interesting visual impact, but lack the childlike magic of the earlier works. As a cutting edge leader in the worlds of art, music, and fashion, it seems that Bjork herself is an entirely necessary component to each of her videos as well. The new track, 'Nature is Ancient,' suffers from a rather dull video treatment, due largely to the fact that the singer is nowhere to be seen in the piece. Still, this DVD is a musical must-have, both for rabid fans and the more casual Bjork listener alike."
4,Full Replacement N/C When I Called Mfg. re: Broken Pieces,"I love mine - it's beautiful and sounds lovely! It did arrive with some broken leaves, BUT I called the toll free number on the box and they replaced the whole thing for free. They didn't make me return the broken one - they didn't make me pay for reshipping . . . In a day when free returns and free reshipping are almost unheard of, they gave me both! And well worth the phone call to cheerful and helpful Edna!"
5,A Tear-Jerker,This book has great detail and I hope everyone gets time to read it.You can just picture the luxorious ship as the book goes on.
4,An entertaining read,"This book was easy to read, fast-paced, yet intriguing enough to keep you guessing. Even exciting. A tale told from both sides; the rich and the to-do-rich."
3,"Not super, but not bad, either. Enjoyed it for what it is.","Exactly what I expected: not super but not bad, either. Stories like this about the Titanic have been told a million times so it wasn't anything new or refreshing, but I still enjoyed it for what it is and did not have high expectations for it so I wasn't disappointed."
5,MUST READ!!!!!,This is one of my fav reads!!! I am a huge titanic freak so I picked this book up out of curiousity and loved every word!!! This story shows the differences between 1st and 3rd class while telling the adventurous and romantice tale of Paddy and Katie in 3rd and Elizabeth and max in 1st. A def must read!!
1,Very Poor in Every Aspect,"The author of the book obviously does not have a very good idea any historic aspect of the time period. The author also had very, very poorly developed characters. Elizabeth wanted to major in literature. However, not once did it mention her reading or writing anything, past or present. Nor was she ever mention anything scholarly coming out of her mouth at all. Yet, we find latter that she scored high grades which means she is SUPPOSED to be smart. The Irish group was not as horribly developed, but they still lacked major development. The author's gain was nothing more than two overly simple love stories. It's quite probable that this book is a rip of the movie Titanic. However, the stories one finds in novels and movies about the Titanic seem to have many similarities among them."
5,Perfect book for those who enjoyed the movie,"Many interesting characters (teenagers and young adults)who come alive before your eyes. The ship is also well described. As someone wrote here, there is indeed some similiraties between Cameron's movie and this novel, but to me it seems that it stems from the fact that back in 1914, an individual did not have many choices in life: those choices were already made for them by their parents according to their social background and their sex. So stories about young adults from that era will often deal with that issue, just as it is in that novel and in the movie. So I don't think that the two stories were copied after one another. The Diane Hoh novel follows much more characters than the movie does, and the plot is well conducted. A lot of fun to read! A page turner."
5,the best titanic book i reed,I THINK THIS IS A GOOD BOOK &IF U R A TITANIC FAN U SHOULD REED IT IT WAS A GOOD MOVIE TO
2,Insulting to the intelligence,"I realize that this is a young adult book, but what do you say when someone asks you to read it? I took it noncommitally and knew eventually that she would ask. I read it pretty quickly, hoping for something interesting, but the relationships are lukewarm, and the plot is only based on ideas inspiring the writer, probably, after having seen the film. At least, unlike the film, the treatment of social classes was a little more realistic."
4,Excellent intro to tackling a 3D project start to end,"While I am a 3D Studio user and own several 3D Studio books, this general-approach book is what I return to time and again to regain my perspective and sense of purpose. While it does not cater to any specific 3D package, it does a better job of guiding one through the creation of a complex model (a blimp) and scene, including lighting and animation. Do not be fooled by the rash of newer 3D books on the market that, though addressing your specific 3D package, are hastily assembled, rampant with typos and erroneous steps, and composed of meaningless discrete examples that take you nowhere. This well-written and carefully-edited book remains one of the best resources on how to tackle a 3D project beginning to end."
4,Work through it and your an instant 3D artist!,"I don't usually rave about generic books like this but I'll make an exception. No matter what programme you are using to generate your little 3D gems, this book will give you a focussed step-by-step intro to doing almost anything that you need to provide professional results. Complete this book, pick up a few more on photorealistic techniques and change your name to George Lucas!"
2,Excellent Fundamentals,"This is the book I had been looking for a long time. Most 3d Software Manuals or tutorials tell you how to do something. But, this book explains why. It also explains the differences in software concepts: Ray tracing vs. scan rendering, surfaces vs. meshes, the different types of textures, and the different ways to apply them. Lighting & camera utilization. A must for every 3d artist."
1,The title of the book does not correspond to the contents!,The book is very superficial and ranked in wrong category (new-accomplished). It also lacks technical aspects to make it somehow serious. The softwares included in the CD is rather poor comparatively to the size of the book. My advice is browse the book before buying.
4,Note: Won't hold 100' of 12 AWG,"When I bought the 100' heavy duty 12 AWG cable, this reel was advertised as a package deal. It would only hold about 80' of the 100'. Other than that it seemed to be a fairly well-made device."
2,About the same as my 7 dollar one but a little worse,"Does the job, but it looks and acts the same as my orange 7 dollar one from Home Depot. The handle clips in but I don't bother. The one thing I do not like is that the bearings are TOO good. With the cheap plastic one, the cord would stay put. This one, it will unwind if there is any uneven weight, like the end of the cord. So I have wedge it somehow. Buy or keep the 7 dollar one."
3,decent build quality but flawed design,"This yet another cord wheel that will hold over 100' ft of cord but assumes you want to unroll it all to use it. Basically, it lacks a 'hole' or entry way to snake the male cord end thru the axis and out of the wheel so you can wind and unwind the cord without struggling so."
3,You don't have many choices when it comes to this one...,"I bought this along with my 100 ft outdoor cable from coleman, it's very light and you have to hold it with your feet to stop it from falling down and creating a big mess. The good part is that you can carry it around with just one hand. It would have been nice if they had a more intelligent cable holding system on the inside, so that you could have extended it from both ends."
2,Designers Edge E-103 Cord Storage Wheel,"Item was delivered on time.However, I was disappointedthat I have to completelyremove the cord from the wheeleverytime to use the cord."
1,A piece of plastic JUNK !,I thought this cord storage reel would hold the 100 feet of snowblower cord. It does not--way too flimsy and light.It is not sturdy at all. Do not waste your money unless you plan on attaching this to a block of concrete it will not be sturdy enough to hold 100 feet of a lamp cord!! I tossed it in my garage sale pile--another wasted internet purchase.
1,totally useless,The cord storage wheel was a waste of money it was to small and fragile for use with a 16 guage cord and while it can wind up a thinner cord it was not much easier than doing by hand also the cord must be totally unwrapped before it can be used
1,Not as advertised,The product I received is not as advertised. It has no holders for the cable as shown on the photo. There's no notch cut and I was unable to install the cable I purchased which is advertised to be sold with this product (Coleman Cable 02569 12/3 100-Foot Hi-Visibility/Low-Temperature Outdoor Extension Cord).
2,Not that good.,It has a hard time holding 100 feet of cord. The handle is too small and tends to fold back up when in use.
1,Added cost but negative value added,"This product is inferior to the cheaper handheld reels that you'll find at Lowes or Home Depot. It is cumbersome to use even when the handle stays in place which it does not do very often. It has a small black handle that you can snap open and then close when you are finished reeling up the cord. Unfortunately it is very poorly designed. It kept and coming off in my hand as I wound up the cord. I didn't bother to return the unit to Amazon because of the bother, but I did throw it away. I went down to Lowes and bought the tried and true hand held cheaper unit. It works!"
2,What a few years will do....,"I bought this from Amazon in 2007. While it did what it was supposed to do, it was priced about 3 times what it is priced NOW (in 2010).At the time I felt totally ripped off... paid over $30 for this and expected much much better quality, not cheap plastic. It is made of very flimsy plastic frankly, but yes, you can wrap up an extension cord or two easily in this thing. Not too easy to unroll without dragging it all over the place though either trying to do it by yourself...Now it can be purchased for about 1/3 of the price I paid... basically it is just cheaply made out plastic that will work. I had expected much better quality when I originally purchased it at a much greater price. For roughly $10, it's about worth it."
3,Only for storage,This is only for storing your extension cord. There is no means of running the cord out of the reel so you can just plug it in and roll part way out. You have to completely remove the cord to use it.
2,"Avoid if you have back problems, alternate wounder suggested","I bought a Toro Power Showel and I need a 100 feet power cord. I found that the hardest part was not shoveling with the power shovel, but dealing with the power cord. I have a number of back surgeries and problems, and I hoped this electric caddy would make it easier to deal with the cord.The electric caddy was not much help, it was hard to control and it requires a lot of bending.Update:I found a better solution - it is called Green Leaf WW-1 Wonder Winder Hand Crank:Green Leaf WW-1 Wonder Winder Hand Crank Extension Cord WinderAli Julia review"
2,Read all reviews before you buy!,"Sorry that I didn't read all the reviews first. The people that pointed out that you cannot run the one end through to have some cord out to plug in are correct. One reviewer said that they ended up drilling a hole in the plastic to get it to work...not a bed idea but you really shouldn't have to do that after paying $15 for this piece of plastic! I am still deciding if we should keep it, may just use it to store a cord when not being used...kind of a waste."
2,Barely Functional Cord Storage Wheel,"I bought this reel for a 100' 12/3 gauge low temp extension cord. I wish I'd bought another product, but will keep and use this one. While functional, it is not user friendly. There is no way to hold down the reel while turning the handle and being able to guide the cord onto the reel. It kept moving around whenever I tried to turn the handle. I would not buy this item again."
2,not fit for outdoor/heavy cords,"I got this as a recommendation thru amazon, plus it seemed simple enough. I needed it also for an outdoor cord for my snow blower. The design is not fit for a heavy cord since it is relatively small and the stiffness of the cord tends to catch the sides and top of the reel. This causes it to not unwind easily. I spend 15 minutes just getting the cord out of the wheel because it got loose towards the inside and had to pull it out one halfturn at a time. Such a pain.I recommend getting something with more weight or not bothering with it. These heavy, low temp cords are very stiff so I don't think there are many wheels that can efficiently hold these."
2,Not a good pair for the cord,I bought this in a package deal with a Toro snow thrower and a heavy duty cord. This reel is not heavy duty enough for the cord it was sold with. It'll do the job but I'd prefer something that feels more robust.
2,designers edge cord storage wheel,Believe you should find a better device. This is difficult to use and not well built. The retractable handle keeps detaching.
2,does not solve my purpose,"good build quality, but need to un-reel the cord completely to use. I was expecting the male end to go thru some mechanism so that you can easily insert into the outlet. not so. you need to completely unwind it."
3,"Helps, but so does just wrapping the cord.","It's a bit clumsy, and does not hold my 80 and 100 foot cords, which is what I bought it for. I don't think it's a huge help - sorry."
2,kind of cheesy and cheaply made,"I bought this to store 100 feet of 14/3 extension cord because amazon suggested it along with the purchase of the extension cord. I have to say I am disappointed in the quality of this reel. The plastic is very flimsy. The rewind handle broke on the first use. Also, the design is poor. When rewinding, there is really no place to place your foot on it to keep it secure on the floor without interfering with the rotation of the reel. I would not recommend this reel to anyone. Look for something a little beefier and better designed."
1,Not worth the money,"This device lacks sufficient size and weight to make storage of a long extension cord convenient. The wheel is unstable when winding or unwinding an electric cord. I found it necessary to hold the wheel by putting my foot on the base and awkward to bend over to rewind an extension cord at the same time. Sadly, this device is also poorly made as the winding handle broke off the second time that I used it. Perhaps the cord that I stored on the wheel was too long for the wheel but the cord and the wheel were both recommended by Amazon together. Having said that, users are unlikely to need this device to hold shorter extension cords. In short, don't waste your money on this poor product."
2,Hmmm not the greatest,It badley needs some kind of moveable trac to keep the cord from stacking up around one edge or another. Also the folding windup handle is useless. I used it yesterday and the handle came out many many times.
3,Maybe it is me...but it is just not working for me.,I purchased these to use to store my long extension cords and I did not realize that you have to unroll the whole cord each time you use it as it is a safety issue to leave it wound while the cord is in use. The product is well made and sturdy. Just not what I thought.
3,Nothing the Internet hasn't told you,Overall not a bad book but I felt that they jumped around too much in their stories. Most of the info in this book is already well known by most wrestling fans. If you must read all wrestling books that come out then go ahead and purchase it. If not just read the websites to get your inside info.
5,Perfect Diaperbag,"This is so perfect especially when you have a purse, you carry your purse and through the diaper-bag on your back. It is has so much space I love it."
2,cheap,"These seat covers attract lint like nobody's business! Buy a lint brush to go with them. The little elastics are not long enough to install per the instructions, and the part that goes between the seat back and seat pulled off first thing. They'll do for now, but I wouldn't buy them again."
4,One of the first of its kind,"African American English has been studied for awhile, but the examples that Green uses are interesting of a language I'm already aware of but never saw it's use in detail described. Very interesting!"
3,Great pictures!,"This book has many wonderful photographs of Rochester's buildings. If you love architecture, or Rochester, this book is worth a look.As a previous critic commented, the book's primary weakness is a lack of insightful commentary. I suspect that the author is knowledgeable regarding Rochester's history, but for some reason was miserly when supplying text. (Perhaps the publisher argued for ""fewer words and more pictures"").As a minimum I would have liked addresses of buildings to be supplied (permitting the book to serve as the basis of a self-guided tour). More on Rochester's history, particularly as it pertains to the types of buildings constructed, might have been helpful.I was also disappointed that there were not even more photos - the Mt Hope section has so many interesting structures that were left out!Summary: Worth the price - but it could have been so much more.(And kudos to the preservation folks who have worked to maintain so much of this city's past!)"
5,6 STARS IF YOU HAD 'EM,"Best she's ever done--and new songs, backup, production, the works: A #1 Winner. LOVED it!"
2,One or two good songs,"I heard a few clips from this artist and thought that I would enjoy the CD, however it was one of those with only one or two songs worth listening to. Just not my taste..."
2,Disappointing,"I grew up several years after Ms. Gore's hits, so I had no expectations on this CD. So for all intents and purposes, I treat her as a mature singer with no baggage, positive or negative.Thus I am disappointed based on what I had heard about her. I do not find the material very moving or interesting. Perhaps some better charts or some different musical colors could have been helpful, some of the songs were just pleading for a vibraphone or a horn to add some color. And Gore's thin voice does not strike me as very expressive at all.Perhaps against the 60s singers from her era, this is a good CD. But if you compare this CD to those of Stacey Kent, Norah Jones, Janis Siegel, this falls way short."
3,"A pretty fair effort for Leslie, no longer the girl who cries at birthday parties! Look 4 work w/ her & ex-Trickster, Jon Brant!","Leslie has been a-pumpin' out theparty tunes, lightly rock for manyyears, just like Jon Brant's rock-in' buddies in his former band,CT.Her Greatest Hits are better as wellas the earlies stuff, in my OPINE."
3,Listen and keep open to an artist's changes,"In the 60s, pop stars played three chords and Lesley Gore stood out with a perfect pitch voice that soared above everyone. Fans will be dissappointed if they think they are going to hear those same vocal ranges. ""Ever Since"" is geared towards jazz and Lesley's voice is strained. It almost seems that she compensates for this by using more spoken word. I believe that her songwriting craft is still keen as ever. Listen to the cuts - keep your mind open and buy the CD. As an artist she continues to grow."
5,Lesley's got a brand new bag,"This CD is excellent! But it is nothing like Lesley's hit records of the 60s. Her voice is considerably earthier and deeper, and the production is much more spare, although very well done. The style is the biggest difference of all, being much jazzier and cooler. ""Cool Web"" is especially fine. There is a new version of ""You Don't Own Me"", 41 years after the original(!), and it is gorgeous, being much, much slower with lovely slow arpeggios on the piano. Bravissimo, Lesley! It is good to have something new from you."
1,Disappointing,The way the wings attach to the wheelchair we have they don't swing out and limit movement. Would be nice if there was information on what kind of chairs they work with.
3,Music review,these girls have a very unique style. A joy to listen to. A great change up from what America & the UK have to offer musically.
4,"Good cable, but need to decide Cost vs. Picture","Great Cable. Really cleaned up my picture. The cable does have characteristics of being semi-ridged, so if you were planning to do any corners you will have to have a long bend.Not happy with the Price, but the cable performance is good considering the low db output from my Satellite System (DirectTV)."
4,Great resource for any science classroom.,I bought this book to help adjust to curriculum changes in the classroom. What I found was a great resource of mini-experiments and demonstrations that spark students curiosity and get them asking questions. Some of these experiments are not easy and can really challenge a teacher to set up and use. Others are pretty sensitive and take time and trial-and-error before you get it right. But in the long run the concepts taught and the discussions that can be developed are well worth the effort. A great book for any science teacher looking to bring some inquiry and thought to their teaching!
4,Very pretty!,"I really like this watch. Its pretty and I love the butterflies that sparkles in the sunlight. My only issue is the size of the face. Its HUGE. I saw the other reviews mention the size, but I ignored it because it was pretty. It fits my wrist fine but the face is very large. If not for the butterflies, I'm sure people would think I was wearing my boyfriend's watch."
5,Cuuuuute and Stylish,"I just love this watch. Got it to spoil myself. Its cute and very stylish. Not big at all. Face is a little less than 1 1/2"". Just perfect size!! Shipping was fast got it in 3 days from Designers Palace. Very happy with my purchase. But it!! You will love it as much as I do. My first GUESS watch!! Hooooray!!!"
1,Quality?,"I bought this watch as a gift because it is so pretty. I liked it so much I bought myself one a few months later.I accidentally dropped the watch this morning (on the carpet from a short distance!)after wearing it for only about 3 months, a link broke, and it is unwearable.Not very long-lasting or sturdy for the rather expensive price of $95!!!!I must say that I miss it already and am quite upset about this."
4,Beautiful watch!,"It ended up to be a little bigger than the picture seemed, but it is beautiful! I am thinking about looking for a white leather strap for it."
4,5 year old loves this.,"This is an older published book so the pictures aren't as bright as newer books and at first my son wasn't too sure. But after diving into it he loves it. This is three books in one. Bible Firsts, A is for Abraham, B is for... and Bible boys and girls. The ABC's section each letter is a short page and my son likes that since they are great for early readers. The Bible boys and girls are longer stories. It is a bit old for my 3 year old yet but five and up is probably good."
1,Borrrrrring!,The terminally boring biography of a talentless poet. Micheal Dransfield and his ilk ruined Australian poetry by glutting the market with tax-payer funded bildge. I look forward to the day when a talented poet receives such lavish treatment.
1,disappointed,"I bought this for my son's science project. The first day it worked wonderfully, but after using it for 1 day, the inside of the cilinder got darker and darker from the iron shaving now the shavings barely stick, and you can't open it to clean, so it's useless after 24 hrs."
3,Bought for 9 yr old boy as edu-fun gift.,"It seems like a 9 yr old boy will like it as well as may be expected. It has the container and 2 pieces. The magnet (inside sealed plastic) and the cylinder with a hole through the center where the magnet goes. Inside the cylinder is of course the iron filings.The plastic is decently strong and may even survive a 9 yr old boy standing on it, not jumping though. The boy I bought it for is very active and rough. I considered that before buying and inspected this before giving it to him.I am disappointed in the arrival of the product. The product is packaged such that it rubs against the plastic packaging, so that even when brand new and sealed (taped closed) the plastic cylinder has fine scratches on it. This makes it look like it could be used when it hasn't been. That is reflected in my rating."
1,:-@,"No me gusto fue la peor inversión que e hecho en toda mi vida, no vale la pena articulo muy mediocre >:-@"
2,Not a Mystery,"My son is a magnet freak! He wanted these ""Dowling Magnets"" for one of his Christmas gifts. He took it out of the box, checked it out for about 3 minutes, and hasn't picked it up again since. Nothing special here. Sorry folks!"
1,Arrived broken,"I ordered this as a gift for my nephew, and the iron shavings were leaking out of it before he even opened it. We can't say how fun or educational it is since he never got to play with it."
1,Can is consisently 1/3 empty...,The sardines are very good. However Season consistently 'shorts' the product. The can is about 2/3 sardines and 1/3 oil.Bad value.
1,Inferior Product --,"The MOST moist, delicious, & sustainably caught sardines are, by and far, the Wild Planet Brand!I tried both the ""Season"" and ""Crown Prince"" brands and the difference in flavor and quality was light years away from the Wild Planet brand.I live in New England and can only find WILD PLANET brand in my local Stop and Shop.It's amazing that we have 3 ""Whole Foods"" Markets in my state and not one carries the Wild Planet brand! They are only carry what I believe to be the inferior quality brands that I mentioned.I'm sure that the Hoffman and Manischewitz families that own Crown Prince and Season brands wouldn't mind having the Wild Planet brand alongside their own, since they feel theirs are such great quality, right?Who knows, they just might learn something about having high standards from the lovely bunch of people that own Wild Planet in California.To top it off, all Wild Planet products are in BPA free cans...what more can you ask for?"
4,Only two fish but very tasty,I was surprised to find only two fish in the can. They were very tasty but very expensive for two fish after paying for shipping. I wish Amazon would stock Seasons products.
3,"OK, but King Oscar is the best brand.","Reasonably tasty, kind of ugly in the can, no comparison with the King Oscar Brisling crosspack in olive oil (which is much more expensive)."
4,"tasty and meaty, but expensive because of no free shipping","These are my favorite sardines thus far, but they are expensive because of not being able to get free shipping. They are meaty and flavorful without being overpoweringly fishy and firm in texture. Easy open can was nice too, as it was easy to open it without splashing like the pop-tops. The only thing other than shipping price that I didn't like was that there were too many large/obvious scales in some cans, which was a turnoff as far as texture and visual appeal. Despite this, they are definitely my favorite so far."
3,more oil and less fish,notice for the last 25 cans less fish and more oil to make up the ounce weightstill tase good but noticeable difference
4,Forgotten treasure...,"This book was from 1962. Great shape and it was an atlas of shipwrecks on the Great lakes. No nonsense-it listed the facts. Nothing but the facts and nothing more. No stories, just facts. Great stuff and I loved it."
4,"It is a fun-to-read, informative book.","I found the uniting experiences, anecdotes and favorite group recipes from clan organizers throughout the United States made the book not only interesting, but blended with Shari's practical public relation knowledge, an excellent addition to any library."
3,nothing fancy,"This is a very basic video without a lot of fancy camerawork. Kelli Marie and her assistants seem very natural and sweet. They do a good job demonstrating the moves that are the foundation of all bellydance.The production seems kinda low budget though. If you like your videos to have really flattering lighting and your hosts to have fashion stylists and great camera make up, this isn't for you. If you prefer a very natural look, and have no previous bellydance experience (including other basic videos) then you might like it. If you've watched any other basic video you will be bored because they all share the same basic moves."
5,g-funk to da fullest!!!,"this cd surely is one of my all-time-favourites. )I copped it back in 96, when g-funk was on its climax.if you like that laid-back-g-funk-tunes from back in the mid-nineties you will love foesums ""perfection"" just as much as any of warren g.s albums. this is straight lbc-sound."
2,not good at all,really bad book although the thesis is an interesting topic another ivy league big shot who uses big words and sucks at writing all though is great at grammar.
4,Great Product for the Price,"I had thePSP PlayGear Street, which holds 3 UMDs along with the console, but I needed something specifically for storing games. I wanted something more compact than the original UMD cases for archival purposes and also something small and transport ready.This product is great for both purposes. It's rugged design makes it great for travel and it compactly holds 8 UMDs.Shop around for the best price first but feel confident that this item will fit your needs."
5,PSP game & UMD case,This product is very well made to protect all UMD. Just hope it will carry more than 8 UMD discs.
3,Not a case for the psp console,I thought this was for the console as well as the umd games...but it only holds the games
5,Handy,a nice thing to use to keep all of your PSP games safe. can store about 8 games. keeps them nice and secure so you do not have to worry about them falling out. i suggest to any body.
5,Very good UMD Case,"I really like this UMD case, 5 stars across the board.As others have said, the clips that hold the UMDs in are very stiff so inserting and removing the UMDs take a little getting used to. I did not see this as a problem, it actually holds the UMDs in very well. Just don't force them in or out and you're golden.I wish the case held more than 8 UMDs! I'm going to buy another one so I can have all my UMDs more portable than the OEM UMD cases.Don't think just buy, you won't be anything less than satisfied."
4,UMD protective case,"This psp accessory is very handy for taking your psp games with you where ever you go, except the case only holds 8 games."
4,Good book with details,"I bought this for my pilot husband. He has really enjoyed reading it and likes the mechanical details they list with each disaster. It would be a 5-rating if the book had color, but he can use his imagination with black and white. Good learning/teaching tool."
4,Compelling and Detailed,"Once again, Macarthur Job delves into the world that houses our darkest fears. Written in striking detail thanks to the increased parameters and quality of CVR/FDR recordings, Job takes the stuff of nightmare and soothes the reader, with the knowledge that the answer is always found at the end.Written above the average reading level, Job does draw on his substantial experience and knowledge of the working of planes. However, even the average traveler will be reassured by the competence, while sometimes surprised by the choices, of the flight crews in this book.I would like to see Job take on some of the more messy cases of the present days - this series is a very even-handed review of accidents with no speculation or questioning conclusions. I look forward, as always, to the next installment!"
5,The Best,Simply the best books on airline disasters I've ever read. The sequential drawings that show how certain planes suffered structural beakup are fascinating and are just one example of the great amount of detail that goes into these convincing analyses.
2,I thought it was me!!!!!,"I was thinking it was me, I'm so glad I read this review my bag which I've had for 3 months almost 4 well the liner is ripped the pockets are ripped as well, and the insulated bag leaks. the only good thing is it fits everything else comfortable.oh and I have the smaller traveling bag and the liner has ripped as well and I don't use it as much. I hope I can return this!"
4,"Need Info, Just bought it","Hi, I'm a first time mother and I have a green yellow stroller and I want to match it with this bag, but I bought it without reading this reviews, I would like to know if any of you tried to contact fisher price to get your bag change or something, because it comes with a lifetime warranty. Did any of you have problem getting the bag change or something? it is true that it has lifetime warranty, what happened?"
1,Good Idea Gone Bad,"With my son in day care i thought this bag would be perfect - boy was I wrong - I actually dislike everything about it !First - the bottle holder is poorly designed - if you put an ice pack in it, it won't close - also when there are three bottles in the cooler it is too heavy for where it hooks on to the bag. The back pocket really should have some type of fastener because the bag is so bulky and if it's not filled completely the pocket bends out and wide open. Overall poor design."
5,Great for multiple children,"We have a two year old and a newborn, and this diaper bag has room for both children's necessities. Plenty of room for 2 sizes of diapers, changes of clothes and those other always needed items. The seperate bottle holder is great because it holds enough bottles and a sippie cup for an outing. We highly recommend this product."
2,"Big, but poor quality","I bought this bag shortly after the birth of my second child. I really needed a bigger bag and thought this was perfect...at first. After 2 months of use, the zipper broke. I can fix it, but it is constantly falling off or simply popping open. Next, the liner inside began to tear. Overall, the product had less than 6 months of use and is literally falling apart at the seams. Don't waste your money."
2,I wish I'd read the reviews...,"because mine ripped before my daughter was two weeks old! I did however call up Fisher Price, who told me to contact the company who made it (I think it was Dolly) and they sent me a replacement. I was really disappointed though because when I was young I remember Fisher Price being THE brand for kids things.As for the bag ripping, I just cut the inside pockets out and ducktaped the lining back together. I figured if it ripped that quickly, the new one would only do the same. So, I figured I'd use the duck taped one until it got too tatty and then I'd switch to the new one. :)Oh, and don't waste your money with the matching little bag. It's only big enough to hold a diaper and a bottle (not even a can of formula). I can stick those two things in my purse if I don't want to take the big diaper bag in somewhere."
1,Fell Apart!!!,"I had my first baby in September. I registered for this diaper bag because it matched my other gear (Car seat, stroller, swing, ect.) I am a single working mother so wherever I go my daughter goes, so this bag WAS used alot. After about two months the inside liner tore apart. Because the inside compartments are attached to the liner, all these fell apart also. This made the diaper bag useless. Save your money and purchase a better made bag. I went out and bought a Graco!!!"
1,somewhat good,We had this bag for about 3 1/2 months. We used the bag for what it was made for. Carrying normal odds and end for the baby when your not at home. But the bags inside started to tear. Fall apart. I wouldn't recommend this bag to any new mom or dad. You tend to over fill. Get a back pack type diaper bag. Its so much easier to carry your baby out of the car and to the restroom with out the hole house over your shoulder!
2,Not what we expected,"We thought this bag would be perfect for when we got to the point of going to daycare because of the ""dirty duds"" bag and bottle cooler. The sad thing is that it won't be used when that time comes. When our daughter was one week old we noticed that the small strap that attaches the ""dirty duds"" bag was almost completely off because it was frayed and we couldn't even recall having used it. When she was three weeks old we noticed that the inside lining was coming apart. This was not what we expected when we saw and purchased the Fisher Price name brand. While the bag is great as far as carrying what we need and being easy to handle, I wish I had read the reviews more carefully and looked into other diaper bags - I will have to do that now since we have to have a new bag....."
2,Doesn't Last Long,I've only been using this diaper bag for 2 months. At first it was great but the plastic inside liner is tearing away as are the inner pockets. I'm not at all hard on the bag. I take it on trips to the mall and quick outings so it's not like I'm beating it up. I've never overloaded it so I don't know why the liner and pockets would tear. I'll go for all cloth next time.
2,bag was made poorly,"The bag was great at first. But then problems a rose. The cooler pouch, which is where your bottles are suppose to go, when one of the bottles leaked in it so did the pouch. Tried everything to clean the pouch but it became very stained. Also after about two months of using the bag the inner plastic lining started to tear out. It was a great bag because of all the pockets and everything but it's not made to be used for a mom on the go."
2,Not worth the money,"I put this diaper bag on my baby registry, and received it for my shower. I have only used it not even 5 months, and the inside liner has ripped. The bottle bag liner also ripped, and the bottles don't stay in place. I called Fisher-Price to complain, and they said their name is on the bag, but they did not make it. It is made by a company called DOLLY, and gave me a phone # to contact that company directly. When I called the #, and told them my situation, I was told to go to their website, and pick out a new bag, free of charge, and they will send it directly to my home. That is exactly what I am going to do. Disappointed with the diaper bag, but happy with the outcome."
4,great bag so far,"I received this bag in August and have used it everyday for daycare since October. (It is now April) Thought it was about time I wrote some reviews for the items I received and was surprised at all the bad reviews this bag has had. All I can say is that I love it: it fits tons of stuff, very easy access to all pockets, nice little extras. The only reason I give it 4 stars instead of five is indeed the front pocket could be a little bigger (for the bottles), but that is it."
3,Good hangers but some adjustment may be needed,"These hangers worked reasonably well to hang rather heavy 13"" decorative plates. Note that the hangers are described as being for 10""-12"" plates. However,the packaging says they are for 10""-14"" plates. Probably best to stick with the 12"" limit. To mount them on my 13"" plates I had to overstretch the springs such that a portion of the spring was deformed. It worked, but you might not want to have to do this. It also wasn't all that easy to fit the hangers to the plates. The hanger wire had to be bent to conform with the shape of the plates, including the hooks on the hanger ends that go around the plate edges. I cut off a segment of each end so that they wouldn't show as much on the front of the plate. Bottom line- the hangers worked but you may have to do some bending and cutting so have pliers and wire cutters handy. That said, I doubt that any other similiar product offered would be any better."
4,Works well,"The springs do not have much 'give' so I had to stretch it a bit to fit, but after that it worked well."
4,did not fit 14 inch plate,Looks fine in terms of quality but was too small for my 14 inch plate despite supposedly being for 10-14 inch plate. Have ordered a slightly larger one instead.
1,Vendor cancelled the order and did not deliver,"I ended up buying it Home Depot for half the cost. I have used these hangars before and they are easy to use, but sometimes it is hard to find the bigger ones."
5,Great Service!,The product was here in a couple of days and it was exactly what I was expecting. I was very pleased with the purchase.
1,Cheaper Elsewhere on Amazon.com,"At the time of writing this review, this toner cartridge is more expensive on this page than the exact same cartridgedirect from Amazon.clickto navigate to the page where you will likely be able to purchase this cartridge for less money and save on shipping (Shipping's free from Amazon)."
3,Some real tid-bits,"This is a look at the life of lawyer Mead Dixon. His early work with gaming properties of Nevada is interesting, but his counsel to Bill Harrah's properties make the best reading. Some good tid-bits here that may not be know to the readers. More life history than gaming history, but R.T.King and Ken Adams present an enjoyable book."
5,Best glue for kids and making wooden toys for children,"I have another side business that I make wooden toys...this glue has no smell, no danger to children and the best seal for children. LOVE IT!"
1,Dirt Bag Millionaire Neutron Jack,Don't wast your money. He's a rich dirt bag who has help ruin the american dream of just being employed while he milked millions from the american people.
4,A good overview,"This book presents a good overview of Jack Welch's way of thinking. It must be read as an ""overview"" as we are talking about a 20 years management history in 90 pages. The summaries (Masterclasses) at the end of some chapters are very good and help to fix Mr. Welch's ideas and how to use then in our daily work. The bibliography presented at the end of the book should be used if one wants to go deeper in some points presented slightly in the book."
2,Not a must have,"I'm not a professional painter so I need a lot of details on how to do something and this book was short on details. Most of the pictures of the effects are very close up, so I have no idea what they look when viewed a few feet away. I was disappointed with this book.Mary"
4,Another great Sister Fidelma book,"I love this series, even though Sister Fidelma is rather crusty and reactive. In this one, she does a good bit of soul searching, and Eadulf does a lot of the sleuth work. A nice balance."
4,Classic B-Westerns!!!,"These two films, ""Texas Terror,"" and """"The Trail Beyond"" are two great B-westerns starring a young John Wayne. I really enjoy these films. Sure they are not the best written or acted films in the world, but they are entertaining to a very high degree. Everyone should see how John Wayne started out in pictures and compare that to how he finished his career. This serves as inspiration to everyone that human beings can improve themselves to an immeasurable degree."
1,I reckon...,"... that mr. Bradbury was 'making' movies for 6 years old retards who could not imagine there was any life after 4. But I wonder what else he could have been able to be used for, except maybe compost, provided some tests been made before, to be sure he wouldn't have been poisoning the land (they didn't know at this time the poisoning was already out of control)!!!!!!"
1,"Gold, Silver, or Bronze","In the olympics, a athelete can place either gold, silver, or bronze. If this book was an athelete in the olympics, it should be tested for drugs and banned from participating in the games. I found this book to be a true waste of my money. There was nothing in there that was of interest to me (a practicing muslim). I am a very forgiving man, as i keep in line with my religion and islam roots, but there are some points where i must cross the line. This book was a problem from page one, containing chronological errors, and inaccurate information. My people have suffered enough, we do not need or appreciate a book like this impeding on the hundreds of years progress we have made.end."
1,Recommendations: Zero.,"I was thinking of converting to muslim. I am no longer thinking that. Not only is this a rather boring book, but it's not physicaly durable. After dropping it only once, it split into 2 clear pieces. I now have 2 books. I don't want 1, let alone 2. My suggestion is not to by either of these books."
1,Not My Cup of Tea,"I don't like tea, but would rather drink gallons of it than read another word of this book. There was something I didn't like on every single page. I can easily think of 40 better things to spend 40 dollars on. Perhaps you have your eye on a 40 dollar toe nail clipper. In my oppinion, that would be a more valuable buy. Read this book, or clip your toes, it's just that simple."
1,Serious waste of my time.,"I dont think this book is worth theh 40 dollars to buy it. I would steel this book and use it to prop up my table legs, as they are very bad and i want to see islam help me with that.Don't buy this book, save your time and buy a new shirt."
5,A Fantastic Brazilian-Jazz Vocalist !!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Claudia Villela is absolutely awesome, she is a Songwriter, Arranger, Producer and on top of that she plays the piano and percussions; but that's not all; her and Teka are perhaps the BEST Brazilian Jazz Female Singers in the world right now. I own several Brazilian albums of all kinds, many singers, and it had been many years since I hadn't been literally blown away by anyone since Kenia. Claudia's voice is sultry, jazzy, sensual and her timing and phrasing are as awesome as they get; both in Portuguese and English.If you love jazz and are looking to upgrade your collection, you've got to get this album asap.P.S. If none of this was enough, just check some of her guests in this album: Marcos Silva, Ray Obiedo, Ricardo Peixoto, Carlos Oliveira, Andy Connell and many more..."
3,Good singer and a few good songs,"Brazilian artists are usually overrated in the US. The magic of Brazil and things Brazilian mystifies us. It's easy to lose focus. This CD has a few good songs, and several forgetable ones. This singer deserves better material where she could do more real singing than scatting. Excessive scatting in this CD detracts from the quality of the artists. Listen to the audio clips. You're the judge and there's no accounting for taste."
5,sax battle,"two of the best tenor players of the jazz era go head to head on this 1959 recording. two long tracks of heavy blowing over a great rhythm section and a nice slow bluesy tune round out this c/d.i bought this l/p in 1961 and it is a ""must have"" for any sax player."
5,AMAZING,"If you like Kentucky basketball, there is no better way to relive the amazing turnaround this program experienced in its' first year under John Calipari. It's also not just about basketball, but about the fans and the hard-working blue collar people of Kentucky. A great DVD for any Cats fan."
4,... iiiii hate that rabbit! - NOT,"This is a good collection of takes on the original shorts that were put together in a movie style format.This isn't what I thought I was ordering, but had seen it before on TV.What I ordered to replace this DVD was the Looney Tunes Golden Collection #5... which is AWESOME! Now I just have to track down the few but other series to find the rest of my favorite original shorts."
2,Not sure why they called it road runner movie,Its ok. My children are 5 and 8 and it starts off with some history and they were soo bored. Once you past that its good but not sure whyt hey called it road runner or why thats even in the title. I got it because I love road runner and he is only in it once; yes one cartoon.The rest are ok but lots of dupes form the golden collection. Shame they haven't done a full dvd of road runner now that woul dbe worth buying!
2,The Long and Winding Toon,"When it comes to classic animated shorts, expanded compilation features simply do not work. The Warner Bros. cartoons should be viewed as separate entities - rather than slapped together (minus the original titles) for the purpose of creating a so-called ""movie."" Save your money and purchase the unedited versions available on the ""Looney Tunes - Golden Collection"" DVD sets."
3,Slightly-butchered classics...,"This is an okay buy if you find it on Amazon at a discount. I enjoyed the cartoons. However, there are a lot of classics here with NO introductory titles... And the follow-up ""moral of the story"" sequences were cut off altogether!! Each of the cartoons were interwoven with a 90's narration from Bugs, who seemed more sophisticated than fun or spontaneous. So these cartoons ran like one long ""movie"", which lost me at times. I think the editors forgot their primary audience are kids? And kids, like the adults who like to watch cartoons, have short attention spans. Cartoons are great with breaks, so you can grab your snack or cereal, or run to the bathroom.I.E.: it would have been better to have a collection of the original classic cartoons with their follow-up conclusions and sequences. These should have never been deleted!"
2,Dissappointing.,"Not really movies - appears to be mostly a bunch of archive footage spliced end to end. (Sorry - with BB narrating)I loved the classic Road Runner footage: but other than that, I was dissappointed."
5,Made a super Gift!,This and Vol 4 and Vol 6 were requested by our son and grandkids to complete their collection of the Looney Tunes Spotlight Collection. They were thrilled!
5,dvd,This is one of my favorite cartoons. I was very pleased to find it and receive it in a very timely manner and in such good condition. I am very pleased with this order.
3,eh...,"I hadn't seen these before and figured it was a cheap way to get a bunch of LTs - between the uninspired modern bridging sequences and the edits done to the toons themselves, I should have just ponied up the bucks for a spotlight or golden collection. I would pass on this if I had seen it before."
2,What happened to the 2nd movie???,"I'm a die hard Bugs Bunny and Looney tunes fan, having grown up watching them as a young child. I slowly watched Saturday mornings get whittled away and slowly watched the cartoons get ""politically corrected"", but this DVD calls itself the ""Movie Collection"", yet skips the 2nd movie. ""Looney, Looney, Looney Bugs Bunny Movie"" isn't on here, nor is it even available on it's own. I know there are a lot of people who think it's redundant or disappointing to see chopped up pieces of the same cartoons over and over in each of these movies, but why buy the movies in the first place if you don't like that? It just doesn't make sense to release this DVD without including the missing one when it is just as unique as the others--""Satan's Waitin'"", ""The Unmentionables"", and ""The Oswalds""....come on now. I love these other two movies, don't get me wrong, but as a ""collection"", this DVD falls flat. Hence the 2 stars."
1,missing dvds,"received my ""dvd"" today and the case was EMPTY!!! How in the world does that happen..I will never do business with this company again...a waste of time!"
4,looney dvd,"why not release just one extended dvd collection? that would be my only complaint, the content is excellent and a must have for any cartoon lover's collection.."
3,OMG! Uggglly cover!,"I love Bugs Bunny movies, but Why does this DVD have SUCH AN UGLY !!! COVER?A lot of Looney Tunes Videos have beuatiful painted pictures on the front, but this time the picture isnt painted, and the Bugs and his friends are drawn in an ugly way. I think theyre supposed to look cuter this way but they don't.My Mom has some Bugs Bunny books from the 1970s and the drawings look like this. Why didnt the DVD makers draw the modern versions of Bugs and Daffy.And why is Tweeti Pie blowing Silvester a kiss. Some people think Tweeti Pie is a Girl Canary but he is really a boy, he wouldnt do this!"
4,Just a fun collection,"We bought this specifically for ""What's Opera, Doc?"" and never thought of ourselves as such fans of what seems to be the majority of this collection, various Road-Runner cartoons. But you know what? With time, there's a certain, shall I say Zen, that comes from just enjoying those cartoons. I'm sure one could come up with major philosophic insights from them, on the bad karma the coyote generates for himself....but, naaaah, these are just fun.So it's a good value!"
5,One of the best around,Damn Good! Well structured and laid out. Clearly defined and very informative.
1,This camera is a dud!,"The QuickCam VC (parallel port version) has been nothing but trouble since I purchased it. It was impossible to install. It never functioned properly. I was never able to get it to work. Customer support is only from 9-5 M-F (and long distance), so it was of no help to me. Once I got throught with customer support they were unable to fix the problem.This is the last device I buy from logitech!"
5,Wonderful,"I have used both the USB and parallel port of this camera, and for the price you can't beat this!Good pictures even in low-light, it's a little annoying to adjust the focus yourself, but it's not a huge hassel.I suggest getting some of the lenses to go with this as well, they're definatly a big help!"
1,awful,"mac users, please don't bother. on the box it clearly states it's for any OS higher than 8.1, but apparently 9.0 is too much for it to handle. the software hasn't been updated since 1998, and on logitech's website the section for this particular camera is so old and neglected it's coated with dust. the FAQ for the pc version of this camera is ten miles long, but of course the mac FAQ is only two questions. but not like that's anything new for mac users. why is this webcam still being sold?"
2,Good Product - - - - Poor Support,"Installation of the Quickcam VC USB version was rather easy as long as you paid attention to instructions. The camera worked good for still pictures,videos, and teleconferencing for about 3 months, then suddenly quit. Logitech's customer support does not have an 800 number so trouble shooting was expensive. After determining that the camera was indeed defective it was returned for a replacement. They sent the wrong version (parellel). Numerous phone calls, costing upwards of $20 have yet to settle the matter. Again, I enjoyed the product but Logitech's support doesn't support."
4,"A fantastic, cheap and easy to use home camera","The QuickCam color was my first USB device and was incredibly easy and quick to set up. The other reviewer is right on the money telling you to make sure to set up the software before attaching the camera. The camera has good quality, a broad array of easy to use features for movie and static pictures, and simple software which will even allow you to set up a live 'webcam' in minutes. A great purchase."
2,Really hard to use,"My dad got two of these so that I could video conference with my family from college. I was really excited, until I discovered that it was practically impossible to get a connection going. My dad works with computers for a living, and even he couldn't figure out how to make these things work. Before you buy one of these, make sure you have, like, the person who designed it on hand, or you'll never get it working :-)"
1,not really Mac compatable,"I bought this camera because it was advertised to be Mac compatible. Unfortunately, it only works with Mac OS 9 and below, which haven't been produced since 2002 or so. Also, the design of the camera is such that you have to place it at eye level (it doesn't pivot up enough) and yet there's no way to attach it to a laptop. So you have to place it on top of a pile of books or something to have it angle correctly.Too bad. I was hoping it would be an inexpensive camera to use in talking with my husband overseas."
1,White supremacist's wet dream,Thought this would be a good book based on the reviews but it was just white supremacy ideology polished up the best it could be.
4,Excellent book,"This book while excellent can sometimes be construed to have white suprecist material. But the author writes many things which are true. Many of the subjects he talks about have come full circle and are true today. Similar to what Pat Buchanan said years ago where people called him crazy, when in fact, everything Pat Buchanan said would come true has come to pass. Back to the book, it's a very long read, but in the end it's worth it for the detailed knowledge the writer has put forth. There's a reason it's out of publication, MANY people do not want you to know the truth! Buy it as you can get it very inexpensive used."
5,A new perspective on familiar operas,"I have enjoyed this book very much. It offers a very interesting psychological perspective on opera whose stories one may just take for granted. The analyses include selected operas from Monteverdi up to the twentieth century composers. Particular emphasis is placed upon Wagner's work, and most of all on ""Der Ring des Nibelungen"", with the list of the most important leitmotives and the concepts they allegedly represent added in an Appendix to the book. So, if you think you may be interested in a short analysis of ""Lohengrin"" from Elsa's perspective, or Don Giovanni as suffering from Oedipus complex, this book may be for you. You may not agree with everything, but it will definitely give you new insights on some of the familiar works."
2,"Like the features, hate the quality","I got this bag as a gift and loved it. The colors were perfect so my husband would carry it and it held everything I needed. My big problem is that after about 4 months of use, the plastic liner started ripping. Not only on the inside but on the bottom also. I probably would have tried this bag again but when I returned it, the store did not have the bag anymore. As a busy mother of 3, I have lots of things that I spend money on and I do not think that I should have to buy a new diaper bag every 3-4 months."
2,dissapointed...,"maybe i read too fast but i only wanted to read this for an hour. i've read many outlines in this vien. unorganized, wordy, dry."
3,Nice clamp setup - easy fit on stock tailpipe,Really like the size & how it looks on my truck.After one winter the chrome is not up too the high cost I paid for it though.Haven't talked to Gibson to find out if they would do anything for me though.
5,A piece of art,"I gave this ""album"" to my cousin in 1979 ( I bought it in Italy) before being transfered to England. I could not find it for so many years...finally it will be in my hands again..a great piece of art"
4,The Uk has Hit!,All I can say about this movie is simply that it's awesome! Although I was only interested in 3 out of the 4 interconnected stories....don't pass this one up!
2,Not Much New Here (Except A Decent Print),"Hong Kong cop (Daniel Wu, sporting better Cantonese than Michael Wong) goes undercover to bust Triad chief (Eric Tsang) and other mob bosses. The problems are that (a) he likes money, (b) he likes watching the boss's wife undress, and (c) he likes to kill. Maybe you can guess where this is going?Well, Wu takes a lot of showers, and Tsang doesn't fully abandon his clownish nature (I'm not a fan of his comedy work). These two create more fully rounded characters than your usual HK crime story, but there's not much else besides that to recommend here. There's one nice theme song used on the soundtrack, but there's a lot of jazz that I did not appreciate.At least, Tai Seng has provided a nice, clean picture. English subtitles are removable, there are some trailers, and also included is an audio commentary."

There are also some trailers and an audio commentary."
5,Plastic product design was never made so clear and pellucid,"Dr.Malloy's book reflects the common problems an engineer would face while designing a plastic part. His book takes all the possible design problems that one might not even expect. He deserves 10,0000000**********'s."
4,Channeled but Of interest,"Michael Kaye has the distinction of being a musicologist who has a literary perspective. His research into some of the lesser-known works of Puccini - most of which were either songs written for ephemeral occasions, or arias dropped from early operas - is always of interest. The story behind most of the works presented here is pedestrian, but some of them are amusing - some outrageous. The composer was not tremendously prolific, and he recycled most of what he rejected into something useful. To me, anyway, this reinforces my view of Puccini as a rather sloppy tradesman who turned out some gorgeous work. Irascible (probably due to his untreated diabetes), womanizer (well, he was Italian), fiercely competitive (he beat Leoncavallo to LaBoheme, and Verdi to Tosca!), this is a scholarly look at the mortar, if you will, between the bricks."
5,Catholic Bible Study.,"we're using this booklet for an in depth Bible study. GOOD FOOTNOTES, THOUGHTFUL QUESTIONS We have a couple of non- Catholics in the group who are included with no offense."
5,The New Benchmark for Success,"This masterpiece will become the new benchmark for those who wish to get their life into shape in only 21 days.Richard M. Krawczyk, Ph.D.a/k/a Dr. Richard - America's Financial Fitness Trainer#1 Bestselling Author/Speaker/ConsultantAuthor of the #1 Bestselling book Financial Aerobics - How toGet Your Finances into Shape"
1,Unclever knockoff with positive reviews by ?friends?,"One might admire ""Dan's"" ambition in self-publishing this slender volume and in rounding up apparent friends to report glowingly about it. However, that does not leave me very happy.I was hoping for some new insights or strategies for personal habit change and instead found a rehash of Dale Carnegie, Maxwell Maltz, Wayne Dyer, etc. Plus, it is surprisingly poorly written and edited.Got to admit, though: he hooked a lot of readers here (one born every minute, they say). I cannot imagine why Jack Canfield and Brian Tracey lent their names - except that it appears these days publishers are requiring their authors to offer such vague, glowing endorsements of every self-help publication that comes off the press."
5,Highly Recommended !!,"This book provides you with a very simple, powerful program for transforming your life. Regardless of what your life goals are this book will take you where you want to go. I don't care if you are the laziest person on the planet, read this book and your life will change!"
1,Positive!,"This is a book that talks about the power of positive habits. It talks about positive habits, and the power of them.I also liked ""Dan Robey is a Tool Who Writes Fake Positive Reviews For His Book and Spams Other Review Pages With Plugs For His Book""...it is sold out at Amazon but I found it for a discount at the Barnes & Noble website, or you can get it at ""The Dan Robey is a Tool"" website. ..the web address is the same as the book title and they are giving away over $1,000 in free e-books today"
1,Never came,"Firstable this order never arrived yet, and I'm concern about it. Can somebody tell when it will be on my hnads?"
5,Master in work,"By reading this book, I have found out that adopting positive habits can really create a dramatic change in our life. I wonder why other people claim this book has nothing new to offer. As for me, Dan Robey's work is a masterpiece."
1,Someone is at it again,"I'm re-alerting people to what ""Warning"" reviewer on october 14 wrote. Look at the October 20th reviews. Looks fishy. Most of them have only one review and that's of this book. Why the sudden flurry of reviews on that day? Gee...I think it's because it's the same person. Amazon should remove those reviews.There are also reviews from ""serene thomas"" in 90 other nonrelated book reviews from on the Amazon site which is how I ended up at this book. And all 90 were submitted on october 20th. It's like spam on Amazon! Grrrrrr!!!"
2,Some grandmotherly advice - but not all it pretends to be,"For starters, this book is very short. The text is creatively spaced and contains a lot of bullets and lists. ... There's not enough backbone to the material for the price. Second, the book amounts to nothing more than grandmotherly advice - some of which might not be good. Robey does not fully justify his claims and at times his use of language is flippant. In general his English is poor and his prose are boring. The book contains so many quotes by other authors - that it left me wondering why someone wouldn't just read the works of those other authors and skip Robey all together (which is what I recommend). Save your money for something more professional."
5,Excellent book; experiences of a young man after coming out.,"Christopher Bram's debut novel remains my favorite. It is in the category of books that would have changed my life if I'd read it at, say, 22. It's 1970 and Joel Scherzenlieb is a young straight man at summer camp, full of dreams of brokerage houses, and fantasies of hobnobbing with financiers. This dream all comes to a crashing halt when his father decides against his returning to the Swiss school he'd been attending. In short order his whole life comes crashing down. He has to live on his mother's farm and discovers he is in love with a guy. The book follows the twists and turns of his life and love throughout his 20's."
1,Nero photoshow deluxe 4,this is an old version and it did not work on my computer. My computer froze at the second (maybe third) step on set up process.I was really disappointed.
2,Won't work on Window 7 32 or 64,I can not get it to work. I tried Windows 7 32 bit and a windows 7 64 bit. Both machines freeze up on the first screen when it ask if you want to import your photos.
2,Way too basic,"If you want zero control and want to let the software make all the decisions for you, this is it. If you have any creativity yourself, you might find this software a bit basic."
2,Nero Photoshow Delux 4,I bought Nero 4 a month ago. I tried to add my music-It only takes MP-3--All my music is WMA. So I can not use the music I like. I burned one CD--No Music -Nero requires I connect to the Internet to Burn--Why? It also took 58 minutes to burn 200 photos. A burn usually takes 10 minutes. I emailed Nero 2 weeks ago with these complaints --No response. So I do not know if there is a way to correct these problems. AJC
1,Shame on Nero,I made the mistake of purchasing the Nero Photoshop Deluxe online. Downloaded it and it has not worked since day one. After many E-Mails to Nero to resolve the problems I have yet to receive a solution. Absolutely no response from anyone at Nero. They definitely had no problem taking my money. This product does not work if you download the version. Shame on Nero.
2,nNeroPhotoShow Deluxe 4,Very easy to work with but the final result low queality resolution pictures.
1,Dud,I want to burn my digital pictures with text and audio and the program doesnot do that. Dud cna't use. It is ashame that I can go to block buster and bring home a DVD and it will play on any machine. But tryto find DVD software to do that at home is impossible. The best program to burn is a JASC for CD but you can't do a DVD./ Roxio is another Dud i tried roxio 6 and 8
1,Great if you don't won't to actually Burn a DVD from it,I love the simplicity of use in arranging a slideshow. It is even great playing the slideshow on the computer...but beware if you actually want to burn a DVD of your slideshow. We have had two responses back from NEro but they have been unable to help us with this. We have also loaded the program on two different computers and have been unable to burn a DVD from it...even their sample show. We have the PHotoshow Deluxe 4.5 version that does include the ability to burn DVD's.Don't waste your money on this one. Very dissappointing!!
4,Nero PhotoShow Deluxe 4,"I have used the product for two PhotoShows. I have found the software easy to use. For the price, I feel that the program is well worth it. There are many graphic and musical options. One drawback is that your first PhotoShow must be ""burned"" from the Nero website. I assume they added this feature to protect their software copyrights. After burning your first one on the web, you are able to burn from your computer at will with their automatic free download. I've read from reviews that you can't place newly added photos where you wish. It is a simple drag and drop option. If you want to place a new photo to the left of one in your show order, drag and drop when a red bar appears to the left of the desired photo. If you want it to the right, a red vertical bar appears to the right. Again, for the price, I am very happy with the software. I plan on producing many family PhotoShows in the future."
2,"Nero PhotoShow fun to use, but.....","Nero PhotoShow Deluxe 4 is fun and easy to use, but I didn't find it more useable or having more features than the one I had previously downloaded for free on the Nero site. I had hoped to have a program that I could use to create slide shows and save them on a CD, but that was not the case. They still have to be uploaded to Nero's website and then CD's are available for purchase to viewers who want them. I don't want to have to pay for a photo show that I already purchased a program to create. I would not recommend this program when a program providing the same options can be downloaded for free on the internet."
2,Nero Photoshow Delux,The reason I bought this product was to make slide shows to play on my dvd player. When I tried to create the dvd the program would time out over and over. I would waste 2 hours and then it would time out at 96% done. When I asked for help from support I got a three page solution that would take a long time and would only be understood by a technician. I am not happy and would not buy another product from nero. The program itself was great but for the purpose of watching the shows off your pc it was a disapointment.
5,These Are Very Very Tasty & Nutritious,So delicious. I wish Amazon would find a vendor to supply these again. I used to get them delivered through the subscribe and save program but they were recently discontinued. I agree with the other reviewer that these are helpful for supporting weight loss and once you eat one you are not hungry for several more hours. Highly recommended!
2,okay creal bars,"Just found these at my local health food store and thought i'd give it a try. They taste okay , but they had a strong taste . Maybe it was the rasins. The box states it also comes in Apple . I m looking for those now. The nurtients in this bars are really healthy."
1,35.00 for 4 ceral bars,"Well I give up. I odered the bulk package (12 boxes) of this product, which is pretty good by the way, but recieved instead 1 box. I e-mailed Amazon to complain and received a reply almost immediately apologizing for the inconveniece and informing me that a new shipment was beign sent ot me immediately at no additional charge. So guess what arrived. You guessed it, one box of ceareal bars. This vendor obviously has issues with math. And while the bars are good, they are not a bargain at $4.25 per bar. I might e-mail Amazon again. I figure 8 more e-mails and I am even"
2,torn box,The quality of this used book said good. The box it the series came in was ripped and the books were very worn. I think that GOOD rating should have been AVERAGE.
4,great pop-punk songwriters,"These guys are great songwriters. Well crafted hooks but still have some street credibility. If you like the Descendants or have other All albums, you pretty much know what you're getting here. In some ways, this record is more pop than some of their other stuff, but songs like Uncle Critic are pretty harsh and keep the whole album balanced.Best part about this, other than the songs themselves, is the performances, which make you think of real bands who played music together, not something that was pieced together in the studio. The feeling here is that these guys got in a room, hit record, and played really loud.To me, this is one of the better All albums as a whole."
3,Nice letterboxed disc from Geneon,"Spaghetti western collectors should know the Geneon release is a nice letterboxed, widescreen transfer. Colors are slightly faded and its non-anamporphic, but otherwise this is a fantastic looking picture for a budget label. Consequently, I was able to sit back and enjoy the film as intended. Actually it is quite funny at times, and nowhere near as bad as reviews would lead you to believe."
1,"Not the Film Noir ""Hunt the Man Down""","This is NOT the George Archainbaud/Gig Young crime story from 1950. Rather, it's a 1971 spaghetti western directed by Eugenio Martín, starring Lee van Cleef and James Mason.My review of the Martin/van Cleef HUNT THE MAN DOWN (aka BAD MAN'S RIVER):Awful. Terrible attempt at fusing comedy, tinkly popular tunes and spaghetti western action. Painful to watch and, because it has such a needlessly convoluted plot, almost impossible to describe. The three stars (van Cleef, Mason, and Gina Lollabrigida) look lost and a little ashamed. Not worth your time at any price."
5,A truly great book,I only learned of this book recently. Wished I had known of it earlier. I felt the author spoke about my needs and it could have helped me to avoid so many mistakes. Going to college without this book is like getting into a car to drive without first learning to drive. A really valuable book. It inspires and gives golden wisdom. This author knows how to talk to me!!!
5,Fun read but much more,"It's rare to find a book that combines such complex ideas with such an engaging story. Once I started reading, I couldn't put it down. Now that I've finished I continue to ponder the ideas expressed in the book.Dosadi explores some of the same issues of power that Herbert explored in the Dune series. The futuristic world he created isn't as detailed as Dune, but I came to really care about the characters in Dosadi despite the fact that they aren't as well developed. On one level it is a fun page turner but the underlying, though provoking questions it raises makes the book truly interesting."
2,Gone astray...,"Poor Mr Herbert. How far are the times of ""Dune""...This novel is based on a paper-thin plot, with an insufficient character development, an excruciatingly slow pace and no particularly interesting ""galactic"" order.The main character is unfortunately as cardboard as a Campbellian SF hero and the other characters are not much better.Another main race besides humans, the batrachian-like Gowachin, is described with few details, and thus their behaviour appears most of the time rather inexplicable.The conclusion is as foggy as the whole novel, with lots of subplots still pending (hopefully no sequel is planned).I did like very much Herbert's early work, but this novel is definitely below par, as it does not achieve ""suspension of disbelief"". Not recommended."
5,herbert's only work to match - and surpass - dune,"The sequel to the much less successful Whipping Star, this is probably Herbert's finest work overall. While it lacks Dune's majesty, it is a more thoroughly thought out work -- amazingly complex, internally consistent, revolving around intriguing characters and based on a fascinating premise. It also raises fascinating questions about the nature of law and intellectual evolution. An outstanding effort and a great pity it isn't more widely read - or in print!"
5,"What science fiction should be,","This book is hugely overshadowed by Dune. It was bit confusing the first time I read it, but the universe of Dosadi has some truly original sentient species that more than made up for this. Like all of Herbert's great novels, the Dosadi Experiment is rich both in surface plots and underlying meanings. Anyone who enjoyed the Dune universe should love this book; it is Herbert at his best."
2,"adorable, but wimpy","This shoe is just as adorable as it is in the photo. What wasn't advertised when I bought them, was that these are basically a driving shoe. You know-- skinny suede sole with nubbies on the bottom. Plus, the weaving is very delicate (which is beautiful). I have been very careful not to wear them anywhere where they would get wet. I even passed my turn in line for a bathroom stall because the floor looked damp. In other words, more cautious than one should have to be with shoes. With all that care, after four wearings, the bottom of one shoe is beginning to wear through the little woven straps of ultra soft leather. If these shoes had the sole of a shoe rather than a slipper, they would be my favorite pair of shoes. Now that they're falling apart, I can't wear them (looks tacky). Outside of a long car, plane, or train trip, I doubt they'll see daylight again. Sniff, sniff, tear."
5,Keeps you guessing -- and lauging,"I totally loved this movie. I went into it not knowing what to expect, and it was totally unpredictable. I literally couldn't imagine what would happen next, and the ending just cracked me up... I really identified with the characters. A lot of times, in movies, people act in ways that make you go ""huh?"" Like, I'm really going to plow under my cornfield to make a baseball diamond. Come on. But in ""I'll Believe You,"" the main character is as skeptical as you are -- so you go along on his insane journey, and I promise you it's insane.If you loved the funny episodes of X-Files, or you love the cleverness/scifi combination of Joss Wheadon, or you're a big Patrick Warburton fan (and who's not?), this is a fun movie."
4,Not the best of them,"Probably not one of the favorites out of the volumes thus far. It had a few shorts that really enjoyed in this volume, but still overall it doesnt do for me what the first two did. I enjoyed this for what it was and that's about all. Not a whole lot more than that, less in the way of really stand out shorts. I'm not saying it isnt purchase worthy because i believe it is but only if your a serious Looney Tunes collector and what to have all the collections that have been released so far. Just a bit above average in my book."
4,Toonbuff,"The material is great. However,I think it would be better if the material was in random order on discs, rather than one cartoon subject per disc. Makes it boring."
5,better than tv,"I am a (...) son of a professor and i have been stunned to learn the greatness of what can be put on to 4 discs. Disc 1 is a great disc filled with bugs classics. Disc 2 stars a very daffy feathered creature with a whole lot more of unexpected things. Disc three has the first Looney thing that hit the streets Porky pig in black and white shorts. And Finally DISC 4 it stars bugs,daffy, Porky,Road Runner and lots more including casts of crazys."
3,"Looney Tunes, Volume 3 a Disapointment","As a collector of vintage cartoons, I was mildly disappointed with this collection. Oh yes, I am aware of what has been said about the introduction of this collection but one can quicly get into the cartoons. I had hoped for more of the the travails of Bugs and Yosemite Sam, Wiley Coyote and the Road Runner, and other great ones, but I will patiently wait for these to come in the future Volumes."
3,Not as good as volumes 1 & 2,"I honestly think they should divide these DVDs better. Either have full DVDs devoted to characters or directors. I think disk 2 in this set sucked. I love Looney Tunes, but honestly, I don't give two craps about 99% of the cartoons from the 30's. There were a few good ones on disks 2 and 3 but most of them were the ones I can't stand to sit through. These DVD's just have them so jumbled together, and the fans have to buy them for just a few cartoons they like and 50 that suck. I wish they'd just release them by directors, because I'd be happy just buying the Chuck Jones sets. I think Disney had the right idea (for once) by releasing them by characters too. MAKE A PURELY CHUCK JONES DVD!!"
3,A little disappointed,"This is the first collection I've purchased, so I can't compare it to others, but I was a little disappointed that it didn't contain more of my favorites. Disc 3 in particular was kind of a dud. Nevertheless, I wouldn't part with the collection since it contains a few all-time classics such as the Hillbilly Hare and Daffy Duck Robin Hood! The quality overall is very good."
2,Lose Whoopi!,"I've always loved these cartoons, so I'd give the 'toons themselves 5 stars. I'm posting here because Whoopi G is on each and every disk. Since I find her to be an obnoxious and lame has-been, I have been going right to the menu to by-pass her. When I saw the postings here, I went back and listened to what she was ranting about. All I can say is thank goodness for the PC thought police for keeping us all on the path. What would we do without the Hollywood hypocrites who feel they are so much better than the rest of us rabble?"
3,3 for Three,"I've loved the previous Looney Tunes collections, but, for the most part, found this one a bore. Some great cartoons are lost amidst silly early ones and middling spoofs of old-time Hollywood, most so dated that I'm sure half the references go over modern audience's heads. (I mean, how many people under the age of 60 know who Edna May Oliver was?) Too many times my reaction to a short was ""That was cute"" instead of ""That was great."" And some of them are, particularly the ones starring Bugs. In a perfect world, Warner Brothers would have come out with 4 disc collections that focus on a single character. Of course, it knows damn well that it would never sell a Speedy Gonzales Collection; so instead the company squeezes him into these Golden Collections whenever they can, which only devalues them as far as I'm concerned. Unfortunately, at these prices, one has to think too hard about buying a set that one will only half-enjoy."
5,THE TRUE CARTOON'S,"THIS IS FULL OF GOOD OL ORIGINAL HUMOR , WITH SLAPSTCK TRADITIONS , THIS IS WHAT SEPARATES THE GOLDEN AGE FROM THE MODERN AGE OF CARTOONS , IN WHICH THE MODERN ERA OF CARTOONS ARE FILLED WTH CRUMBY FART JOKES AND DRAMA QUEEN TEEN JUNK."
3,Disappointed,The DVD was new and in excellent shape from the seller. But did not like Vol 3. Did not like having Whoopy Goldberg on the intro to EVERY dvd. A lot of cartoons inlcuded were too old and in black and white. Other volumes produced were better.
3,Full disclosure would be the honest way to go,"While I haven't purchased Vol. 3 yet, I'm disappointed to learn all of the discs in the set feature a Whoopi Goldberg health warning. This from one of Hollywood's more notorious potty mouths. Look, the real issue here is that the Editorial Review posted by Amazon does not tell the buyer they will get Whoopi counseling in the package. This is neglectful advertising and has no place here. Afterall, these are cartoons, not real life...."
3,Least of the sets so far...,"This one has the fewest of the great Looney Toons. Definitely NOT a must-buy for any but the serious collector. I liked it and my kids liked it, but it was certainly not as good as the first two. I am questioning whether I will plunk down 50 bucks for the fourth collection, but I don't regret this purchase."
4,I also agree with Kevin McCorry,"Volume three has some great cartoons, but there are so many more, most of which I have had the most exposure to. There may be a few too many pre-1948 cartoons to my liking, but this may have been to create more of a ""collector"" feel to the volume.I felt one classic Porky Pig pre-1948 ""Trap Happy Porky [Jones, 1945]"" was missing from Disc #3. But I had forgotten about ""Daffy Duck Slept Here [McKimson, 1948]"", which had me in tears.I also am looking forward to seeing Ralph Phillips, in addition to more Yosemite, Foghorn, Speedy, and of course Wile E. Coyote - super genius, in the future volumes, which I hope will be packed to the brim with post-1948 cartoons.And what about a Tex Avery compilation Warner Brothers! C'mon already!"
4,"Another nice batch, but where's ""Ali Baba Bunny""?","I love having these wonderful cartoons on disc to enjoy. But I suppose we will have to wait for future collections to see Ali Baba Bunny, one of the funniest cartoons ever, featuring Bugs and Daffy at their best. It is supposedly included on the Looney Tunes Movie Collection (it's featured in the movie ""Bugs Bunny's 1001 Rabbit Tales""), in case anyone's interested.Other cartoons I'd love to see included in future sets are Rabbit Hood, From A to Zzzz, Operation: Rabbit, Hare Splitter, Buccaneer Bunny, Mutiny on the Bunny, Bushy Hare, and Knight-mare Hare.Meantime I will enjoy the first three collections. It's such a pleasure seeing these shorts in all their glory."
2,Possible the worst in the series...,"For my money it's a toss-up between volume 3 and volume 5 as to which is the worst in this series. This set has a fairly good Bugs disc, but even that has a few mediocre cartoons on it (Hare Remover, The Wabbit Who Came to Supper). I have no use for much of the second disc except for the last 4 or 5 cartoons, and the first half of the third disc contains clunkers that didn't even make me smile, let alone laugh. The fourth disc is much, much better, but still has a few snoozers on it. There are some great cartoons on here that are not available elsewhere as there was no Spotlight Collection that year so this is still a must-buy for Looney Tunes Lovers, but I wouldn't touch it until you've bought Golden Collections 1, 2, 4, and 6 first."
3,I wholeheartedly agree!,"I agree completely with Kevin McCorry. While I am happy to have the likes of ""Waikiki Wabbit"", ""Easter Yeggs"", ""Super Rabbit"", ""Rebel Rabbit"", ""Duck! Rabbit, Duck!"", ""Hillbilly Hare"", ""Robin Hood Daffy"", etc., I am NOT happy at having had to buy 20 old, unamusing cartoons along with them. At Amazon's asking price of almost $60, that's $20 up in smoke for cartoons I have no desire to ever watch. I hope the next set has a better balance of cartoons (meaning more later toons, fewer 30's and early 40's toons)."
5,"Get over it, this collection is great!","I wasn't going to write a review until I started to read the reviews already posted. I can't believe how many people are giving this wonderful collection fewer stars because of an annoying introduction that can easily be skipped by the press of a single button. I personally can't stand W.G. and think the introduction is politically correct hogwash. However, nobody is ""forcing"" me to watch it. Remember, we're reviewing CARTOONS here! All of you people who feel the need to go into a right-wing tirade and whine about liberals and communists need to get over yourselves and just enjoy the cartoons! That is why we're here, right?And so with that, I give this collection FIVE stars. I agree there isn't enough Foghorn or Yosemite, but that just gives me more to look forward to. This collection does have some of my all-time favorites, especially An Itch In Time.So let's all hit ""menu"" when Whoopie comes up and enjoy the show!"
3,Political Agenda with a Side of Great Cartoons,"This collection would be a lot better without Whoopi G. at the beginning trying to make Looney Tunes into a tool for indoctrination. The cartoons themselves are great, classic entertainment for the whole family. Just be ready to fast forward every time you load a DVD after you hear ""Hello.."""
4,fun product,"I'd purchased Looney Tunes (volumes 1 & 2) some time ago, so was concerned whether this set would be as delightful. I needn't have worried! It's great!"
5,Looney Tunes Gold Volume 3,"The DVD arrived on time and as promised in new condition. I am enjoying this DVD, this is the first time I bought a dvd thru amazon and I believe I will be getting more in the future."
3,NOT ENOUGH CLASSICS!!!!!!!!!!,"C'MON WHERE ARE THE CLASSICS WE HAVE ALL BEEN WAITING FOR? HURDY GURDY HARE,A LAD IN HIS LAMP, GONE BATTY (BOBO THE ELEPHANT) MORE FOGHORN LEGHORN, PART 2 OF THE GAMBLING BUG (HUMMER FUN) AND WHAT ABOUT CHOW HOUND(WHAT NO GRAVY!!) WHO""S KITTEN WHO (W/DODSWORTH) ,RALPH PHILLIPS, BUSHY HARE (NATURE BOY),8 BALL BUNNY(THE PENGUIN) AND NAPOLEON BUNNYPARTE(NAPOLEON)I HAVE THESE ON VHS WHICH I TAPED 30 YEARS AGO. AT LEAST I CAN WATCH THEM UNTIL THE CLOWNS AT WARNER BROTHERS REALIZE THAT THE OLDER CARTOONS AREN'T AS FUNNY AREN'T WRITTEN WELL AND ARE BORING TO WATCH!!!!! MAYBE VOLUME 4 HOPEFULLY.ALTHOUGH SOMEBODY WAS THINKING WHEN THEY INCLUDED HILLBILLY HARE !!!!!!!!!!!"
2,Sean Krueger knows what he's talking about,"I agree. C'mon WB, get you act together. Sean hit the nail on the head!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Although he was way to generous with 3 stars."
2,Great Cartoons Ruined by Whoopi's Presence,"It is too bad. This is a great collection. It would have been 5 stars if it weren't for a meathead like Whoopi Goldberg being stuck on there. They force you to watch her on EVERY disc! The garbage that they are putting on DVDs these days, that you have to watch before you can see the ""feature presentation"" is getting old. And this one is an abomination!"
4,More Looney Tunes Less Whoopi,I could do without having to see Whoopi Goldberg every time I watch a CD otherwise more great Looney Tunes.
2,"Not for those looking for ""Saturday Morning"" Looney Tunes","We loved Vol 1, liked the majority of Vol 2, but Vol 3 was not to our family's liking. I've always loved the Looney Tunes like those featured on the 1 1/2 hour Saturday morning cartoon show (I believe it was called ""The Bugs Bunny / Roadrunner Show""), but have never grown to like the black & white shorts or the ""Woodland Band"" type of Warner Bros cartoons. The pre-release reviews had hinted that this set was heavy on those shorts, but, not knowing the titles of most of the Tunes (and doubting the veracity of such reviews), I gave the Volume 3 Collection a try. Unfortunately (for me), the pre-release reviews were right on -- one complete disc and parts of the others are black/white or the era with the super-sized Porky Pig and more animal-like Bugs and Sylvester.If you are more inclined to enjoy the Roadrunner/Sylvester & Tweety/""Duck, Wabbit, Duck"" years, hold off on this set, as there are very few cartoons that will be to your liking."
4,ALMOST Perfect...,"This looks to be a GREAT collection (looking forward to seeing Daffy as Robin Hood once again), but I agree with the other review about ""not enough Foghorn Leghorn"".Also: I've been waiting to see the Abominable Snowman; ya know... ""I wanna love you and hug you, and kiss you and squeeze you, and I will stroke your fur and call you George...""How much longer do we have to wait for a classic like that?"
4,What's up with the cover?,"This collection has a bit too many cartoons from the 30s for my taste, but those obviously have their place in history so who am I to complain? It's also got one of my favorite cartoons ""Hare Tonic"" by Chuck Jones, but is missing one of my other favorites ""Hare Conditioned"" (which was done in the same style and featured the same Bugs as ""Tonic"").Anyway, just wanted to make a comment about the cover, which I find odd. I don't remember it from any cartoon and at a lower resolution, the figure Bugs is holding kind of resembles a, um, blowup doll. I know it isn't but I can't figure out the significance of it. It just looks odd.In any case, nobody gets these things for the cover art, so it's a minute point. As for the DVD collections, keep 'em coming."
4,"Nice Work, but needs some Toonin' if you know what I mean","Where, I say where's the Foghorn Leghorn!! We need a disc on him!!!"
4,Looney Tunes Golden Collection Vol 3,This is a great collection of Looney Tunes. Makes three of the five collections I own and a welcome addition. Recommend it highly.
5,Barbara Pym,"Surely one of the most under-rated authors of her day or any other, she writes so calmingly and convincingly of an England that was but that really no longer exists. If you like good reads about England in the middle of the 20th century, you will love Pym."
3,Pleasant surprise,"While this book is set in England following WWII, I find its themes to be relavant today. Slighly funny. In fact I will read it again because I may have missed some of the humor. As a single woman who is excellent in the 21st Century, I appreciate Pim's point of view!"
4,"Funny, witty, what took me so long to discover B Pym?","I will be reading more from Barbara Pym. Excellent women is so witty, subtle and insightful. She really is an under-rated author!"
4,Even funnier the second time.,I read this book when I was in graduate school in the 1980s and again just recently. It was just as funny the second time! I especially liked the character Rocky Napier who is played in my mind's theater by David Niven.Mildred is such an astute observer of human nature. She manages to take her own path despite frequent interventions by others who want to include her in their own agenda.There is very little action. The only crisis occurs when the pastor's pretty fiancee wants to have the family diamond ring reset!
5,CAPTIVATING BRITISH SATIRE,"I enjoyed this book by Barbara Pym so much that I have re-read it numerous times. The characters are so true to form, for their social status and period, that they literally leap out of the pages at you. Nothing goes the way you would expect it to, however, when the characters are sorted out at the end and continue on their way, you cannot imagine it could have happened any other way. Ms Pym writes with a certain amount of ""tongue in cheek"" humor that is very understated, which makes it all that much more hilarious. If you enjoy a nice, gentle reading experience, interspersed with tears of laughter, this book is for you. An excellent addition to a library that includes Jane Austen. I cannot recommend it highly enough."
4,Very enjoyable,"This is definitely not a Jane Austen novel, though it is enjoyable in its own right. The protagonist, Mildred Lathbury, is also our narrator -- a woman who is, generally speaking, at peace with her spinsterhood. She is a thirtyish single woman of good works, but she is also surprisingly funny. Sometimes she is downright canny regarding those people with whom she deals; at other times she seems to be endearingly dim.I really enjoyed this book, my first by Barbara Pym, and will look for more by this author."
2,Boring,This type of book does not show any excitement for me. I like books that are adventerous and contain historical facts.
2,What were they thinking?,"Man, I can't believe Cold, Weezer, and Unwritten Law actually stooped to the level of doing something like this. All the other bands, I can see it, but these guys are way too good to have anything to do with the WWF! 2 stars for a phenomenal new Cold song, but why oh why does it have to be here?"
3,Okay,"Like the other reviewer said this is a fairly decent video showing a good history of rock and blues guitar, and the guitar in general. But the video fails to mention greats such as Duane Allman, Buddy Guy, Johnny Winter, Joe Satriani and so on."
3,Teachers Beware: PG-16,"Actually, it is a decent video, covering a fair amount of territory in the history of Rock and Blues guitar playing. Lots of big-name cameos (though they neglect to introduce some of them to the camera by name). Unfortunately, it is NOT APPROPRIATE for public school if you are looking for something to add this perspective a guitar class--You may get away with it if you preview and fast forward through the 5-or-so instances of rough language, the smoking, and the less-than-quaint section on the sexual nature of playing the electric guitar. Censored, you can use it, but there is probably a better option out there. It is a much better buy if you are not planning on sharing this with the 13-year-olds in your life."
3,Small Town Girl (1953),"This 1953 musical version of ""Small Town Girl"" starring Jane Powell, Farley Granger and Ann Miller is a remake of the 1936 romantic comedy that starred Janet Gaynor and Robert Taylor. However, Amazon is mistakenly listing the 1953 musical DVD as a 1937 release. Highlights are Ann Miller tapping to ""I've Gotta Hear That Beat"" with Busby Berkeley's orchestra that's all arms and instruments, and Bobby Van's human pogo-stick number. One of MGM's minor musicals, it's still lots of fun and Jane Powell sings as pretty as ever!Small Town Girl"
1,Not as lucky.,"Unfortunately we were not as lucky as some and have had no luck in obtaining a copy of Small Town Girl that would play in any of our machines or computers. Amazon was very kind in their response to the situation and have exchanged copies of the disc for us. None of them worked and it basically came down to their finally refunding our money. They were not able to give any suggestion as to why this DVD would not play in any of our machines. So, be prepared that the DVD of Small Town Girl may not work with your equipment. Good luck."
4,"""I have a feeling love in Duck Creek could be pretty wonderful!""","When handsome, big-city boy Rick Livingston, III (Farley Granger)speeds through the small city of Duck Creek, he is sentenced to 30 days in jail. He tries to buy his way out but Judge Kimball refuses. Eager to get out of jail and celebrate his girlfriend, Lisa Bellmont's (Ann Miller) upcoming birthday, he stages a hunger strike. But he eventually gets the feeling that the judge ""just doesn't seem to care"" if he starves or not. Rick convinces the judge's daughter, Cindy (Jane Powell), that it is his mothers birthday so she agrees to let him out of jail (fully aware of his real intentions to see his girlfriend)...if he will take her to New York with him.As the story goes on, Rick gives Cindy a tour of New York before returning to Duck Creek and the two of them end up falling in love.Once again, a great musical that's not yet on DVD!"
4,Small town girl locked in a closet of elegant furs,"Very sweet vehicle for Jane. Wonderful character actors. And if you like dancing there are some very elaborate numbers. Farley Granger is quite nice as the spoiled rich boy who speeds thru a tiny town and sentenced to jail by the judge, Jane's dad. You can imagine the fun situations this leads to as song bird Jane falls for jailbird."
2,Not so good,"The fabric is very nice and the fit is good, however, the design is uncomfortable. Apparently whoever designed the the crotch area didn't give them a test run first. Hanes is a much better buy!"
5,Comfy,"These are really comfy and don't ride up, looks great under jeans and dresses.....etc. I bought more in different colors."
5,I have never had such great customer service,"I placed this order a few weeks ago so I can not remember the details, but I had some kind of problem with this order - for some reason I couldn't order a color I knew they had - it was an Amazon glitch, not Undermoments. Anyway, I emailed the company to inquire and they were more responsive than I could have imagined. They wrote to me on a Sunday. They followed up to make sure everything was ok when they hadn't heard from me. They adjusted the shipping charges because I had to order twice when I was really ordering once. They let me know that they had received the order and everything was good.Truly fabulous service. I will always go to them first for undergarments. I am truly impressed."
2,"OK, but...",...not as good as Gilligan & O'Malley. The picture is much better than the actual product.
3,disappointed,"I was very disappointed with the cheap quality of this product and the price was way too much, I returned this item for refund and had an immediate credit from Amazon, so nothing was lost except my postage costs."
1,mtrcare,I was hoping these would be my new favorite underwear but after wearing 1 time I will never wear these again. I wear a medium but these seemed slightly tight and boy did they ride up my butt. So uncomfortable. I will just have to keep searching.
3,k cliffs red,I bought this bag to wear when I ride my bike. Its pretty good. No inside pockets though so I found myself having to use additional zip bags and small pocket bags inside to find things quickly. The next issue I have with this bag is that it is not lined. Water goes right through with the slightest onset of rain. Anything you have in the bag has the potential to poke through and it is riddled with micro holes. Good bag for temporary but not good for your everyday bag.
1,why you say !!,"because it is alot larger then what it looked like, ...also its made to wear over your left shoulder....someone goofed...."
2,Terrible Material,"I was very disappointed with this product. The material it is made from is too stiff and has no flexibility. It is very cumbersome to carry, and I almost lost a $400.00 cell phone in one of the shallow pockets. I just don't like the way it is constructed. I only use it when I am going a short distance to the beach. I am still looking for something softer and more user friendly."
2,Disappointing and overly simplistic,"This book was a real disappointment. There were far too many convenient coincidences, and the short length of time during which Chris goes from ""innocent"" to quick-to-suspect-the-worst-of-everyone is simply not believable.There was only one point that had a trace of Pullman as I know him from the brilliant ""His Dark Materials"" trilogy: when the book discusses how the loss of innocence (in the metaphorical, Garden of Eden sense) is not just bad, but also good in that people who lose their innocence then have the knowledge they need to consciously do good in the world.The book is also manipulative in that it opens with the sentence: Chris met the girl he was going to kill..... and then does not follow through with a conclusion that supports that statement."
2,Disappointing,"I enjoyed ""Count Karlstein,"" ""The Golden Compass,"" ""The Subtle Knife,"" and ""The Ruby in the Smoke"" and its sequels, but I was very disappointed with ""The White Mercedes."" It is a most depressing, negative story. The writing is inferior to that in Mr. Pullman's other books, and some of the content is almost pornographic. This might be all right in a book written for grown-ups (though I wouldn't care to read it), but it doesn't belong in a YA book."
3,Where's the blackcurrant flavored ones?,"I usually love Rowntrees Fruit Gums and they've changed little from my days in South Africa. HOWEVER, they put in less and less blackcurrant flavored ones which are, by consensus, the best and thus my drop from 5 stars to 3 stars. In addition, its close to impossible to buy Rowntree Blackcurrant Fruit PASTILLES nowadays and my calls, both to the manufacturer as well as to the suppliers of the candy have yielded no answers whatsoever. If anyone knows why please let me know. I have noticed that other manufacturers have come out with blackcurrant flavor but I have not yet tried any of them. Any suggestions?"
1,1.6 stars ... Ehh ~,"A very mediocre Sinead single here. The trippy reggae remix of ""Rebel Song"" is terrible. The loopy sound completely clashes with the serious emotion the lyrics were written to reflect. I have never yet found a good remix of one of her songs, however, so it wasn't too much of a surprise. While I my grandest hope was on her take of the Irish classic ""Her Mantle So Green,"" it doesn't even compare to previously performed traditionals such as ""On Raglan Road"". So for those like myself who are looking for understated gems of the old Sinead caliber, in my opinion this single is wholly negligible."
4,Extremely well written,"Hard to compare, since there isn't a lot of competition in the world of spiritual-inspired magazines. Tricycle stands out on it's own as a great publication. Well written articles, and a broad range of topics covered. And, my favorite bit, they don't repeat themselves every few issues."
1,Poor Editorial Integrity,"This magazine is not produced by Buddhists. Unfortunately this means that people like the Executive Editor have little or no understanding of what it takes to produce articles that are helpful to people interested in or practicing Buddhism. Furthermore, they produce a sort of Oprah or Dr. Phil type magazine with plastic ""experts"" contributing, as opposed to those with real work practice. Of the few genuine experts that do contribute, they mostly do so to promote a book or a tour. Disappointing that this is merely a bandwagon publication. It would be better to see something produced by and for Buddhists."
3,I liked it but . . .,"I really liked Tricycle. I enjoyed the articles and poems and found them interesting, and informative. But the magazine really smells. Every issue exudes an unpleasant odor. I found it difficult to read the magazine because it smelled so much. I cancelled my subscription when my son refused to sit in my lap while the magazine was open."
2,Eminence Stone Crop Hydrating Gel,"This product was just ok. When I looked at the bottle and noticed that it didn't have the copyright symbol on it.....It made me wonder whether or not it was the real product or was it a generic? When I used it on my face,it didn't feel any better and didn't see any positive results from it. Next time I will try it out at the spa salon to see if it is any different. Eminence Organic Skin Care - Stone Crop Hydrating Gel 1.2 Oz."
3,confused,"The book seems to be filled with important information, but is a very hard book to read. I struggled to get through it and after finishing it I still don't have a good argument for the topics. I just found it a hard read."
5,A must-have for chow chow lovers!!,"Out of all the chow books I've read this is definitely the best! On almost every page there is a color picture of our favorite furballs, and it's packed full of information on the usual info such as grooming health care, etc, but I especially enjoyed the chapter on showing (or not) and the chapter explaining canine behavior. But my favorite feature of the book is that every page contains info about chows in particular, not just watered down generic information that could apply to any breed of dog. Thanks to the authors for helping me better understand my chows!"
1,To be avoided...,"I'm forwarding this review by Bob.I do not recommend Nu-teck airless tires they are very dangerous Nu-teck says that there tires are guaranteed to never go flat!! well that's a lie, mine went flat, that did not bother me to much. until I asked for a new tire. they said that it's my fault for using the breaks to hard. and I created soft spot. well I'm 67 years old I have a small folding bike 20 inch wheels I only use the bike to go back and forth to the store, I don't race or jam on the break. Nu-teck, just wants to get out of the guarantee. Nu-teck is a bad company to do business with, ricktig.dk is the same company, don't do business with them, if you could help me so other people don't get flim flamed tell your friend not to buy airless tires. and if you see Nu-teck ad please cut and paste let others know. this company is not honorable and does not stand behind it's guaranteed, I'm putting this company on ripoff.com and youtube, BBB and 7 on your side, plus, bob williams"
1,very poorly made,"the tire fits in the rim of my dahon folding bike nicely , but it swerves side to side opposite the rim so when i try to ride with it it feels like the back of the bike is in a washing machine."
4,38 Artists 26 Patterns,"This is an entertaining and beautiful book, featuring the work and stories of 38 artists. Each artist is given 2 to 6 pages of pictures and write up. In my oppinion only 6 or 7 artists are showing innovative work and they are deffinetly worth seeing. The rest is bulky sweaters and shawls and a few children's designs. If you love oversized sweaters, this is the book for you. A few of the photos are ""artfully out of focus"" not good for seeing the work. Check it out at the library first or buy a used copy if this interests you. 26 Patterns are at the rear of the book. The patterns are for advanced knitters."
2,For Serious Collectors Only,"After hearing Falick on a podcast and hearing the ""story behind the book,"" I picked this up at the local yarn store to leaf through it -- and quickly remembered why I hand't bought it the first five times I'd looked at it.I find the concept of this book somewhat garbled -- is it a pattern book? If so, there aren't enough interesting patterns to make it worth the investment (most are very dated). Is it a profile book? If so, there really isn't enough in-depth info about either the yarn stores or the store owners to make it entertaining.The photography, however, is gorgeous. So I've finally categorized this book as a ""collectible."" If you're looking for knitting patterns, don't bother. But if you want something pretty to set on your coffee table -- or if you own every other knitting book out there and need this one to complete your library -- then go for it. Otherwise, leaf through it at the store, admire the pictures, then put it gently back on the shelf and walk away."
5,A celebration of American knitting traditions and styles,"Author and knitter Melanie Falick spent years searching through knitting books, finding the most beautiful ones came from England with the idea Britain held more talented knitters than America. America Knits: 30 Projects For The Whole Family To Knit And Wear From The Country's Leading Artisans seeks to correct this idea, packing in patterns and artisan profiles with gorgeous color photos by Chris Hartlove of notable creations. This isn't another pattern book: it's a celebration of American knitting traditions and styles, packed with biographies, artist accounts of knitting, and regional color."
5,Cute as a Button,"My six year old is loving the website and the pet. She enjoys earning money on the website to purchase items for her pet. It teaches some very good lessons too, such as beware of buying something you don't need. (She bought a trampoline and then realized that she needed to have an outdoor room to store it, which she didn't have.)"
1,GARBAGE!!!!!!,Bought this cat for a gift. What a joke! Very tiny in size and it was all scrunched up in a plastic bag when i received it. Tried to poof it out and fluff up the hair. The whiskers aren't even in the right place! Piece of junk. DO NOT BUY!!!!
5,Greatest Gift,The cat is just as cute as the picture. I know it will be loved for years to come and the webkinz website is a bonus.
4,Webkinz Persian Cat,"I purchased this Persian Cat for my granddaughter's 7th birthday. I thought it's an educational toy, teaching money value. She went online, adopted her pet, then couldn't do much else. The webpage was down for some reason, and she was very disappointed. She couldn't continue with purchasing items for her pet. She hasn't gone back on since....She just plays with this cat as she does her other stuffed animals."
2,Better to pass on these!,"I bought two of these because they appeared to be cute online. Having purchased 15 other Webkinz, from Amazon including cats, lions, ponies, tree frogs, rabbits, etc., these just don't measure up. The fur is coming out and isn't pleasant to touch. Threads are hanging around the face that shouldn't be there. Their necks are as thick as their bellies. The tail is flat and looks like it belongs on a beaver. These animals were bought for a children's Christmas charity. I hope the kids won't be disappointed because I certainly was. I purchased the two Persian Cats from an Amazon vendor and not directly from Amazon. They were jammed together into a small bag, not individually wrapped as the Amazon ones were. I would return them except I would have to pay shipping both ways and it wouldn't be worth it."
2,average compilation of worn-out hits,"Well, this album is MTV for you - take the great songs and play them to death. The advent of the ""Buzz Bin"" made us think about ""alternative"" music. Once an indie haven for those who didn't want to get involved with cheesy 80's pop or hair metal, it is now big-bucks stuff. This CD gives us all of the latter - Cracker, Stone Temple Pilots, Danzig, etc. All were great songs the first twenty-three times we heard them. We bought their albums only to have their best song blasted at us again and again. Don't buy this - you'll lose even more appreciation for the very songs that made rock music what it is today. Instead, go buy something awesome like Sunny Day Real Estate or Belle and Sebastian that won't get overplayed by greedy television personalities."
3,"Review of Flamenco, by Claus Schreiner, et al.","I like this book with one major misgiving: the chapter on Joselito. Though Joselito is fascinating, she gives incredibly misleading information about dancer Antonio Gades. I feel that the author of this chapter took Joselito's point of view, which is skewed, and presented it as if it were the absolute truth. As all know, Antonio Gades is a major figure in flamenco dance, and not to be taken lightly. I disagree with Joselito's comments when she says that these types of comments are ""part and parcel"" of flamenco; they only show Joselito's own jealousies and rivalries. Other than that, the book is fine, the pictures are wonderful, and the chapter which includes the flamenco letras is very good."
2,not good,"This book is a disjointed collection of ""essays"" about the various aspects of flamenco: cante, guitar, dance, castanets/palmas. History is thrown in somewhat randomly; parts of the book are repetitive. Occasionally you glean some kind of interesting fact (e.g. the flamenco scale is the same as in Indian and Arabic music), but it is otherwise not put together well enough to be informative. I second the view that the nostalgic, pro-gypsy, modern-flamenco-is-not-really-flamenco bias starts to get annoying. You get the message that the only real flamenco is performed by gypsies in the privacy of their homes, which *you'll* certainly never get to see so you might as well give up."
5,you will feel like you know Limp Bizkit once you read this,I met Fred Durst and you will feel like you know him persanally once you read this book!
4,Drugs in Bear Country?!,"When the city of Bear Country hear that there is a drug lord in town everyone is shocked! But Brother Bear, Sister Bear and Cousin Fred know what to do. That get right on the case. They have so many suspects how are they going to find out who did it?It is a great book. Good mystery and some comedy, It is great for a first chapter book!"
2,condition of book,The book was not in the condition I expected for the price or the listing. It smelled badly and the corners of the hardcover were frayed. Disappointing!
1,not what I wanted,"There was nothing wrong with the product,it just wasn't what I wanted when I received it. It could work for someone else."
4,Quite a Surprise,I ordered and read the book for a class so I didn't have high expectations. I was surprised by the well-reasoned arguments that are still up-to-date. The C.S. Lewis introdution makes it worth buying this edition.
4,Compulsory reading,"I enjoyed reading this short Christian classic by St Athanasius. He lays very important foundational truths. Highly readable and very clearly written. A 2012 translation of the English perhaps is needed to ensure it continues to command wider readship. My rating of 4/5 is merely that it does not quite belong in that category, yet, where I anticipate re-reading it. Not because it does not deserve 5/5, but because more fuller exposition of the issues now exist elsewhere, which undoubtedly have built on this."
2,I'M NOT DEAD,"Brothel is an oddball movie. A woman loses her husband then goes on to buy an old brothel in a mining town. Ghosts appear and she asks them not to smoke. She takes on their persona and you have to question her sanity or are the ghosts real. If you like ""Red Shoes Diary"" type of films, you should enjoy this as it is erotica written from a woman's point of view.Parental Guide: F-bomb, sex, nudity"
2,Not enough information.,"I was worried about getting the book on time for my class had started. But this wasn't the fault of the book store but I did not realize that it was the shorter edition of the text book until I was taking my first test and found that most of the questions on the test were over material that I had not read.The information on amazon about the book did not list that this book was the shorter edition. I had to turn around and rent an e-text to correct the mistake so I am not happy about that. I much rather have a book in hand than one on a computer screen. You live and learn!Will I ever use this book store in the future? I may but I will not wait until the last minute the next time, in case there is a problem.Thank you,Student Lisa"
1,Advise that matters,"Do not buy this book. My professor selected this title for our introductory class, but two days into the course students were asking for alternative textbooks to buy. The book fails, big time, in explaining basic concepts and uses terminology that for an introductory class needs to be explained. I also agree with the other reviewer mention about the excessive amount of ""copying and pasting"" from other books. A disaster. I wish I could give it 0 stars."
5,Super walking CD,"This tape is fun, high energy, made me feel great. Couldn't wait to get out there and walk. I like the two sides with increased pace on 2nd side."
2,high energy walking,I didn't care for the music. It just didn't work for me. I like the Biggest Loser Country Hits to walk with.
1,Terrible,"I think I did some eye rolling every single chapter. This book has a very limited audience. I read YA books regularly and this one was horrible. Not only predictable, but it had absolutely no backbone. Don't waste your time."
3,Putting boys on the ledge,It was pretty good and a little romantic so cuteI recommend this book to whoever wants to read it
3,Fun Read,"This was a very fun and fast read and it would be a great beach read. The story is about a girl that learns a lot about boys and life as she has her first high school crush.This story is about 14 year old girls and their relationships with each other and boys. What I really found refreshing about this book is that the feel of it was your typical 14 year old girl's story. The characters were realistically 14 years old and acted like they were 14 years old.The main character, Blue, is clueless about boys. She has never had a real boyfriend and as she enters high school she develops a crush on a boy she meets at a musical tryout. She takes advice from her friends who are also clueless about boys and ends up learning about love and life from her families hired help, which happens to be a teenage boy.Cute story, fun characters, easy read. I really enjoyed it. I plan to finish the series out."
3,"Made the Grade: The Girlfriend's Guide to Boys Series, Book 1","3 out of 5 stars, this is a sweet and endearing novel about a girl coming into her own. It is a good novel and series for young teen girls. Very empowering. The characters were fairly realistic and very entertaining. Blue and her friends are a close group of girls who, at first, you might not expect them to have anything in common, but for some reason their friendship works. Colin was a great character too. I enjoyed watching how his playful side came out with Blue.I recommend this story and series to anyone who is a fan of Young Adult novels!!Review By: From Me to You ... Book Reviews(read more of this review and a teaser on my blog)"
5,Book,Loved this book. It was really inspirational . I couldn't place the book down. Once I began I wasn't able to s tut stop reading.
4,"Awe first love! And friends, their advice!","This book will bring you back to that first kiss . You remember those nerves,where you wondered where your hands are supposed to be or whether you were doing right. It deals with all the strangeness of first dates and meeting the family . It's about friends being there for you and helping you through those years offering advice whether it be awful or just being there for you when you screw up. It's about sharing secrets and looking out for each other ."
4,awesome quick read,Totally worth reading. It's not very complicated and hasn't got much of a complicated plot but it was a fun read all the same. I liked the sweetness of her first love. It's a funny novel with surprisingly happy and enjoyable moments. I would recomend this to young teenagers who like romance.
2,WTFreak!?!?!?!,"At 1st i waz lik dangggggg dis book good, but then i started loosing interest, the speech you used towards the end bored me, you used similar grammar & context that I've read in mannnnyyyy storiesTRY SOME ORIGINALITY NEXT TIME"
3,So so,She seemed so young and it just never allowed me to get pulled into the story. It was still ok though.
3,Putting boys on the ledge,This is a very good book for adolescent girls to read this book is a very small one but it's still very good.
5,Best book ever,I loved this book one of the best b books I've ever read :) I really enjoyed the ending of it
5,Charming,"This is a cute and charming read, it gives you advice how to control your man and gives a cute little love story with it . A great read!"
2,kiddie,Definitaly a book for a younger person. More like a book for a tween. Since the main characters are 14 years old!
5,Excellent book,Wow love it recommended!!!!! This book was patrolling couldn't put it down I am looking forward to reading the next book :)
5,AWESOME!! :),A VERY INTERESTING BOOK TO READ. REALLY KEPT MY INTEREST IN FINISHING THE BOOK. A SHORT AND VERY CAPTIVATING BOOK.
5,The book,I loved it!!! It was so romantic and I feel like that every time I see my crush. Best book ever
3,More like putting me on the ledge!,I chose this rating because all in all the book was really predictable yet at the same time you easily fall in love with all of the characters.
5,Awesomely awesome,I liked the whole thing and I hope she writes more books like this this book was really good really good
1,An awesome book......,It was great I loved the book it was sooo real I felt like I was there and that it actually happen it was a great book I recommend it. :)
5,Putting boys on the ledge,This book is really good. I'm sort of like blue cuz I like a guy and does he like me? I guess I'm on the ledge not him.
4,Loved it,I loved this book. It reminds me of my freshman year in high school and how it was so important as a freshman to fit in among the crowd. This book is really sweet and innocent . Definitely a good reading.
5,Oh my gosh best book ever,This book views right into the soul of every young adult out there. It proves relationships are built on love not how popular someone is or if they're hot and you think you like them.
1,Putting boys on the ledge by :Stephanie rowe,This is my new favorite book and I don't like girly books best book ever!READ this book you won't regret it
4,The Reviewer,"This book is a lifesaver for girls with boyfriends. If only girls knew about the Ledge sooner. I think though it's a twist on Blue's life. Heath ( in the beginning) sounds like the guy who is perfect. Colin, not so much. But as Blue goes on her journey we now know we don't want to be on the Ledge. I like my spleen where it is on my back. This is a guide to all the girlfriends. I can't wait to read the rest of the foursome's adventure."
4,Ok,"This book was so short. The ending was not good I thought it was gonna end with an amazing quote like most books but in the end all she said was ""my life is perfect"""
5,Aweeesssoooommmmeeee,This This book was amazing !it's funny how oblivious some girls are to their beauty. And wen a boy likes them and they go after the wrong one...but anyways it was amazing and Ihappen to read all of Stephanie rowes books!
2,Ehhhh,The book wad very repetitive. I thought the story was cute but I already knew what was going to happen before it even did.There was no suspense.
3,The Ledge,The beginning seemed very boring. Kind of like an annoying freshman girl with low self-esteem. Didn't grab my interest really. Even with an went on and on about the cool hot guy Heath. It wasn't until Colin cam into the book that things started to get interesting.
5,Awesome book,"I loved that I was long and explained everything. I also love how the I fat to read the other girls story too. Even tho I already read a book to day I stayed up til five in the morning reading it,it was that good."
3,Funny romantic,It's was funny at some of the parts and it was also romantic would not let a 8 or 9 year-old read this but for a preteen it's perfect.
5,Amazing!,Such an inspiring ending! LOVE LOVE LOVE! Stephanie Rowe did such a good job with the story line! Favorite book I have ever read!
2,Placebo? can't be Oprah likes it!,"Oprah Winfrey and Kevin Costner the leading medical researchers in America think this is a great break through. Well gee, if they like it you must too. There is no scientific basis other than the nice school teachers ""guarantee"" that this works. After you pay 5-6 bucks for some fizzing tablets that taste kind of good you might think something is happening. Well it probably is, in your psyche. If that and Kevin Costner testimonials do it for you then go ahead. Can't seem to find the ""guarantee"" on their web site other than they will do their darndest to improve the product and you'll be the first to benefit."
2,Don't buy this,"An absolute waste of money. Poorly constructed and rollers aren't even on the same plane. Once it set at jointer or table saw height it is super unstable. It's stable at 24"" height, but what use it that in a woodshop?"
4,...,"The Nephilim are backHeavier, louder, and pushed forward in time; but, still the familliar sound carried through. Though, I need to emphasise that this doesn't sound like either band spawned from the disbanding of the earlier incarnation: Rubicon and The Nefilim; it's not the same old Fields sound re-tread. Now utilizing more keyboards (think the moody use on Elyzium) and some minor drum pattern assistance, the long wait was well worth it.It's a great single and I cannot wait to hear the new material!*Note* I only gave this single 4 stars because both tracks are re-workings of older pieces."
3,One More Nightmare--Fields of the Nephilim,"This ""new"" release is very similar in sound to the last Nefilim album, ""Zoon"". It's a bit distressing that FothN feel the need to re-work two songs that were perfect the first time around, especially ""Darkcell"". Still it's great that they are at long last doing something. These re-workings are very much in the sort of dark, metal-like vein that Carl McCoy has been experimenting with, but they still possess a certain power. If one does not try too hard to compare these new versions to the originals, they are fairly good. Hopefully FothN will not take too long to release a new album of all new material."
2,Does the book need an update ?,This book was published in the year 1962. I wonder if it needs to be updated to be accurate and to take into account discoveries since 1962.
5,"I only THOUGHT I loved Lady Day, then Jimmy came along","What can I say? I first saw him during the L.A. riots on the Aresenio Hall show singing backup for Lou Reed. They were the only guests that showed up. The tiny man with a voice to shame Gabriel's trumpet sent shivers down my spine. (He appears on Magic and Loss by Reed). I didn't catch his name at the time and always wondered who he was. Then I finally watched the Twin Peaks series on video. For any Scott fan who does not own ""Twin Peaks -- Fire Walk With Me"" YOU MUST BUY IT!!! ""Sycamore Trees"" is the best Jimmy Scott I have EVER heard. This album is really spectacular. Jimmy excels on Angel Eyes and Somebody to Watch over Me. His voice absolutely has to be heard to be believed. Innocent and pure and able to tear your serenity to shreds. GET THE ALBUM!!"
4,Terrific Emotion; But....,"If you like your music with heartache, intensity, and tempos that feel like a bubblebath at 100 degrees, buy this album. I knock off one star, only because that mood is pervasive throughout; it's a ""one mood"" album. With that limitation, it's quite an album. Jimmy Scott has done probably the most heartfelt interpretation ever of the extremely oft-covered Cole Porter's ""Every Time We Say Goodbye"", possibly Porter's most heartfelt song. That one sticks out in my mind as the highlight of this set, but I could say the same things about the title track. Great album for getting your ""significant other"" in the mood for ""sack time."""
4,Yeah they're cheap speakers and they're great for certain applications,"If you really want to sit and listen to all the nuances of your favorite music, or you want to throw a dance and have all-enveloping sound, than pay more and get the speakers that do more. All I wanted was an extension of my main office (next to the garage) into the actual garage so that when I am working out I can play music into both rooms from one amplifier. I'll be listening to these speakers while practice my karate punches and kicks on my Wavemaster, so I'm not paying so close attention to musical subtleties. I got these up and running last night and they are suited for my purpose just fine. Thanks BIC for making a tolerable cheap set of speakers!"
2,not very good sound,"These speakers should have sounded better - but do not, Very poor quality bass and won't handle med + sound levels. Not worth the money."
5,Very useful companion,"This has been very useful. I redo the ""codependency no more"" about every 6 months. I simply need to be reminded of my engrained personality traits and this is a great way to work the twelve step program with it. I cannot recommend it enough"
2,lost interest,"It was hard for me to keep interested. Lots of info, and I am sure it can help some people. But I lost interest in finishing it."
4,recovery is beautiful,"This is an excellent recovery tool used in conjunction with a sponsor, small group setting and reflective meditation.It is difficult to find a more comprehensive guide covering the 12 steps."
5,Overlooked folk rock classic,"Sounds a lot like John Prine, but with a different lyrical slant. Nice acoustic band here, including James Burton. Melodic stuff abounds, so hunt down a copy of this lost gem."
1,The book title is misleading,"I bought this book thinking it was some kind of satirical look at talk radio.It was not.Other than using Franken and O'Reilly's pics on the book cover, it has nothing to do with them. The book goes through different political organizations on both sides of the political aisle, including their founders, history, budget, and mission. Real funny.I never felt so violated as a book purchaser.And wouldn't you know it, Franken's blurb for this book is:""Walsh is a political genius. He is funny, intelligent and articilate. Everything that I am not.""Another lie from Franken"
3,The printer has been great for in-car use.,"I travel across New Mexico and I needed a printer that I could use in the car. I have a dc/ac converter, and the printer sits on the passenger side floor board. The printer is a bit slow, but for what I need it for, it works like a champ. It is the best thing I have purchased for on the road."
1,"If you really want a color printer, buy an HP","Having worked with many different kinds of printers over the years, I can say say that the Lexmark product is the weakest of all of the products I've used. Of course that should be mildly obvious by the fact that they charge nothing for it. ""You get what you pay for"" and all that.The main problems it has is print speed and quality. If you spend a little more money to get the lower end HP or Epson, you'll be much happier in the long run.I have heard good things about Lexmark's service and their upper range printers are much better, but this low end option is not the way to go."
3,"Nice, cheap color solution","This is a nice printer for the money. (You'll spend more in cartridges in a year than you spend on the printer.) The resolution is solid and worth the wait. It's a perfect, low-cost home solution for your color printing needs."
5,Incredible,A great documentary that thoroughly discusses one perspective of one of the nation's most controversial topics. This documentary is informing and addictive. It grips your attention and forces you to keep guessing what their going to say next. A masterful and interesting documentary for both sides of the abortion argument.
4,Very Good Documentary but not the Best Produced.,"Soldiers in the Army of God was an insightful documentry.After Roe vs Wade most women who decided to undergo abortion used politics toprove their decision was rational.Today, 30 years after the implementation of globalism, abortion has become an industryand millions of women use abortion as a back drop for indiscriminate sexual promiscuity and drug abuse.The documentary ends without a clear solution and hinting to a lack of thoroughly thought out production on the part of the producers."
5,Best Grammar Book Out There,"This is the only grammar book you'll ever need. With it, you learn about different sentences and their structures, as well as methods of diagramming sentences that highlight the form and function of each word. This gives you the tools that you'll need to edit professional papers, because sometimes you just need the right words to explain the changes that you've made.Of course, I took an actual grammar course with the man who wrote this, so maybe I'm biased?"
5,The only college textbook that I wish I still had,"This is more than a reference book. It's a necessity. This is the only college textbook that I wish I still had. Sadly, as a poor college student, I stupidly sold it back to the bookstore at the end of the year. I have been fumbling around with other unwieldly grammar reference books for half a dozen years and am fed up. I am buying the book again. How many college textbooks would you rebuy?"
5,"A well written, funny, and most of all truthful book!","I bought this book and I read it froim cover to cover in one day. There was not one thing that was said that I disagreed with. It was all true about my sign, and others that I read about. Also, it taught me things about myself that I never knew. Best of all, it was written with a hint of humor that made it all the more interesting!"
2,"SAME STORY, DIFFERENT (DAY).... BOOK","I FOUND THIS BOOK TO BE THE SAME OLE HASH, REHASHED! THIS COULD BE ANY OF A NUMBER OF BOOKS ALREADY OUT ON THE SHELF, AND SOME OF IT SOUNDS JUST LIKE THOSE BOOKS.I SUGGEST YOU SAVE YOUR MONEY! IT'S NOT MARTINE YOU NEED WHEN IT COMES TO HOW TO TREAT YOUR ASTROLOGICAL MATE."
1,Wish I hadn't bought it,"The reviews sounded good and caused me to buy this book for a little insight and maybe entertainment. Alas, I was highly disappointed after reading it. It made strange comments that I felt were way off target. Hoaky is a good word to describe it and looking at the publication date (1979) came as no surprise to the then-trendy style of writing."
5,"""Reference"" book","Not much to say other than I bought this book a number of years ago and still use it as a ""reference"" book to this day. The book is easily understandable and is accurate more often than not. As others have said, my only complaint about the book is that it is man-woman relationship-oriented, rather than something more encompassing. I wouldn't live my life by the book, but it certainly does make for an interesting read."
1,A generalization of sun signs,"I also read this book many years ago. Someone just recently sent me a copy. There is a small amount of truth just going by the sun signs, but I wonder how the author can acutally claim the sexual traits of every person born under these signs. Then all of these people read about you or someone and assume that this is what they are like altogther. It's actually kind of humorous in a way. But people are made up of more than just their sun sign. So don't judge a book by it's cover."
4,"Interesting, even if your aren't into astrology","As a person that doesn't really believe in all this astrology stuff, I found the book to be quite entertaining. Everything was dead on. It gives you great insight about the way to please your partner and yourself sexually. A good book to have on hand."
4,excellent,this book is a very good book because it explains every horoscope extensively and there is a lot of information which i have gotten from this source
5,A must for lovers of kitsch,"Absolutely hysterical - was the highpoint of our Christmas party, so glad I took it along. Although aided by alcohol this absurd book had us rolling on the floor.Apologies to people who believe the flimsy chuff that is astrology - but how anyone could take this book seriously is a mystery.A masterpiece of straight faced nonsense which will make you laugh so much your nipples fall off."
3,Star Crossed Lovers,"'Sexual Astrology : A Sign-by-Sign Guide to Your Sensual Stars' didn't quite work for me and my partner. Not surprising, really. She's a Virgo and I'm Herpes."
2,Are You Kidding?,"This book is obviously a bit dated. Many of the author's statements written in the late 70's are totally unsubstantiated by any facts or figures. For example, the author states that a Scorpio male will not take NO for an answer even to the point of rape. The author tries to substantiate these broad conclusions by referring to one or two personal acquaintances or hearsay. For the Pisces female, the author states that her dependent nature can lead her into a master-slave relationship. Again, this just doesn't jive with the current BDSM activity and communities I've known. Yes, the Piscean female can be dependent but master-slave relationship? Just how did the author reach that conclusion? Overall an entertaining book that does offer some insights into the personalities of others but readers should bear in mind that the book was written in the late 70's and not take it as absolute gospel."
3,So so,"Book is kinda weird. The discriptions are some what accurate but mostly just comical. You may find out you like pedophilia, dirty old men, or getting your lady parts touched by feet. Uhhhh yeah definitely weird but good for a laugh. Glad I only paid 25 cents for this one"
4,interesting info on sexual compatibility,"Not an astrology person, but open to new age things and was turned onto it by a woman I dated several years ago. Got this book when I recently started dating somebody new. I found it interesting to go beyond the basic ""What's Your Sign?"" (Sun Sign) style compatibility you see at a very basic level. I definitely feel there is something to it, although I am not ruling my life by it.If you enjoy astrology, I think you'll like this. If you're like me, and just dabble from time to time, you will also find it interesting, perhaps more so. Even if you think it's total bunk, it will give you interesting things to consider in your relationship."
4,Fun and Insightful,"I wouldn't consider myself an avid follower of Astrology and Horoscopes, but I do enjoy reading about personalities and relationships! I bought this book and really didn't expect much, but when I started reading about my sign, I was blown away by its accuracy. Already, five of my girlfriends have read segments from this book and we have laughed and really enjoyed the tips included on relational compatability!"
5,Fun Reading!,This is the second time I have had to buy this book because people keep taking it. Very entertaining reading and nails my boyfriend to a T.
2,If astrology was taught in school this would be the text book,One of the first astrology books I read. Lots of details but has some really out there parts basically making people seem crazy. It reads like a text books not a light read. Also seems really dated but it was written in the 70's. I'd recommend sexcopes for more of a fun view on sexual astrology.
1,WRONG BOOK,"The wrong book was saent to me - the packing slip listed the correct book but whoever was supposed to place the book in the package failed to pay attention. I tried to email the company twice, asking them to send the correct book and a return package for the book they had sent me, but I didn't even get the courtesy of a reply email."
3,amusing,"I found it a fun thing to read on my lunch break and that's about it. There are better books out there, but this one is okay."
1,Wow this one is old!,"Okay I bought this because I like Martine's other astrology book, ""The Only Astrology Book You'll Ever Need"". And it truly is the only one. LOL Sexual Astrology is from the 70's when she was no doubt, at the beginning of her astrology quest. It's not a bad book, just outdated. Good thing I only paid 5 bux for it! lol"
3,Sexual Astrology: A Sign-bySign Guide to Your Sensual Stars,"This book is okay for those that want a ""cookbook"" approach, but not for those that are really studying astrology."
1,For The Recycle Bin,"I received a this book as a gift about 20 years ago. I thought it was rubbish then and I think it's rubbish now. Even as a light hearted book, its akin to a tabloid newspaper and doesnt do astrology any favours.It's a sad testement to the misunderstanding about relationships and sexuality ,especially in relation to astrology ,that this book is still around.For a true understanding of the subject read Liz Greene's book 'Relating.As for this book BIN IT!!!!!!"
4,Challenging,I use all of Tracey's pre-natal and post-partum videos and this one is the hardest. I still haven't gotten past Phase I abs! It's defnitely a great workout but no modifications are shown for those of us who just started exercising again after baby. I'm dedicated though and will keep working on it. Haven't tried the butt workout yet.
5,Bertie and Jeeves At Their Zaniest,"Of all the Bertie Wooster and Jeeves sets, this one takes the cake for sheer zanieness. Want to see the always dignified Jeeves in drag as he impersonates an authoress? Or, care to see a black-faced Bertie staring back at the African chief he dresses as in an effort to lift a curse of a totum ""thingie?"" These six videos are chock full of more of the Wodehouse magic, and, though they differ in places from the print version of the stories, they would probably make P.G. ""Plum"" Wodehouse himself chuckle. Directed by Fairfax, they push the comic envelope in a way not dared by directors Simon Langton and Robert Young. The result is first rate idealic world laughs from the precarious predicaments so often a part of Wooster's life. The music throughout is a special treat, and the casting brings back such favorites as Madelaine Bassett, Florence Cray, Tuppy Glossup, and Gussy Finknottle. Loosen your belt when you put in these videos and prepare to laugh yourself hoarse."
2,A sad follow up,"This is exactly that. I very poor follow up to the other series. The humor is scant to none and the movies have been turned into hollywood representations that p.g. wodehouse would shudder at. The stories are less absurd and more fantastic and the characters chosen to act in this series (excepting wonderful stephen fry and hugh laurie) are poor excuses for actors. If it weren't for the slight resemblance to story lines of wodehouse's books, all would have been lost. (let me note also though, that the books the movies are patterned after, are not even jeeves stories at all but another collection of wodehouse stories.)"
4,When does the fifth book come out?,"I've now read all four ""Dead"" books in the Loon Lake mystery series and am recommending them to friends and relations who enjoy not just good mysteries, but series where you get to know characters like friends and neighbors.Like most of the women he encounters, I've fallen for Ray and come to admire Lou, the police chief who stars in each of the books. Houston's plotting gets richer in each effort, her characters more intriguing and always there is such lush detail in her descriptions of the Wisconsin woods I feel like I'm there, boating, hunting and especially catching and cooking up fish."
3,Dead Frenzy,"I liked the story, it was a very interesting book, although I find sometimes there was too much about something that really had nothing to do with the story. But otherwise a good read."
4,"I was ""wedged"" into my seat for this thriller!","I've always loved McBain novels and Killer's Wedge definately didn't make me change my mindset. This novel epitomizes what the word ""thriller"" is all about. McBain's subtle writing style flows wonderfully from page to page. Virginia Dodge is the perfect femme-fatale: sexy, sultry, and oh so dangerous! I read the LARGE PRINT edition simply because I had forgeotten my glasses and bought this in an airport before a flight to Europe and I needed the large print so I could read it. But I'm positive you'll enjoy this book in any edition, it's solid, thrilling writing!!"
1,killer's wedge,"this book was very outdated. also, it was more like a novelette. worst McBain effort i've seen and in general i'm a fan. not much effort involved in this and pretty unbelievable plot."
2,I rate this a C,He has written books about the 87th Precinct that are much more enjoyable. Hopefully the next read will be more to my liking.
3,Average McBain,"It is a good McBain, but it falls short of the genius of McBain. While entertaning it lack the usual samething that makes a McBain something so pleasent to read"
1,Killer's Wedge,I've tried to read several kindle e-books by this author & his 87th Precinct Series.I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND ANY OF THEM! Very OUTDATED and poorly written. Like reading a book by a grade school student written in the 1950's. SAVE YOUR MONEY! There's much better authors & books available.
5,Unreal Power for a Computer Speaker System,"I'm going to keep it short. The Promedia 5.1's push out 500 watts of SERIOUS sound. They shake the floor during a DVD, and you can only put it up to about 60% volume during games, its TOO loud even at that point. Connected to an audigy 2 sound card, these are the best of the best. Dont hesitate if you are willing to spend the money, these are amazing speakers.My system: Dell XPS Gen 3, 3.4ghz P4 extreme edition, 256mb X800 XT, 1 GB RAM, 74gb Raptor hard drives in RAID 0, 20.1 inch LCD, and Klipsch Promedia 5.1 500 watt surround sound."
2,My Amp bites the dust.!,"I have to add to the reviews on the amps in these failing. I purchased my Promedia speaker system through Dell on 10/04. Recently the sound quit working. I finally got Dell to send outa rep to replace the sound card...only to learn it wasn't the sound card but the Amp located in the SubWoofer.Needless to say....I am not a happy camper having to send back the amp to Klipsch along with $90 to replace it. I bought the top of the line speakers thinking that not only will they sound great (they do), but last for years(which reading other reviews and doing some research they don't).I'll give Klipsch 'one shot'at making this right in hopes that the next amp lasts much longer than this one did. If not...will never buy another Klipsch product again!"
1,Both Klipsch Subwoofers Died,"The first subwoofer died (no sound) after 6 days. Remember, the sub powers all the speakers in this system. I sent it back to the company I bought it from and they were nice enough to take care of ""Klipsch's faulty product"". They asked me if I would like a refund and like an idiot I said, ""No, just send me another one"". The replacement Klipsch system arrived and it played great for about 14 months and then NOTHING. No power from the sub! Same problem but now my warranty is up. Klipsh has a way of designing things to work just past the warranty. Shame on Klipsch for making such a shoddy product. Shame on me for asking for a replacement and getting burned twice. Heed all these warnings my friends. I would buy used speakers at a garage sale before I would buy another Klipsh product. YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!"
2,Another voice to the chorus,"I bought these to replace my very old, well worn v2-400s which were being retired, despite a fair number of bad reviews at the time and they failed within a week. Sent to Klipsch for repair and they failed again 6 months later. The whole experience from failure to support was very dissapointing, especially from my ex-favourite computer audio company. I will be reluctantly moving to Logitech for my computer speakers."
1,Klipsch Thx 5.1 - Two Failures!!,"Of course, there is a design weakness in these speakers, probably worthy of a Class Action Suit against Klipsch. I've had two system failures in two years, similar to the many other reviews here. I've already paid for one round of repairs. Contacts with Klipsch take a lot of time and get no where unless you are willing to pay them to repair a problem apparently endemic to the design."
2,Best sound from a 5.1 system... while they work!!!,"I have had this system for 2 years, and for that time it was, simply put - AMAZING. It was the best sound I had heard from any 5.1 system for computers. My friends were amazed by them. Then the sub stopped working due to 1/2 of the amp failing. Its a very common occurrence with the BASH amplifier included in this system.I give it 2 stars because while it is working, it is the best. But far too many people experience failures from them for me to be able to recommend it to a friend."
3,Buy something else,"Honestly, I bought these becuase I thought the 2.1 promedias were just phenominal. However, Klipsch proved me wrong with these.While they sound pretty damn good, the speakers are very fragile. It seems they don't have that long of a lifespan, as I had to replace the volume control once within the first 6 months, and it sounds like the system speakers are dieng on me after about a year and 4 months of use.However, Klipsch does have nice customer service (at least for me), and fixed my problems pretty fast. Good company, just a bad product. Buy something else."
2,"I was ""klipsched""","I bought this system as part of a Dell XPS 4 gaming system. It was the best option they offered in the speaker department and after reading the reviews on Amazon and other sites seemed like a reasonable choice. My reaction from day one was, ""that's it ?"" The sound is tinny, marginal at best and certainly not worth the price. It's almost painful listening to mp3's and radio on them. The construction is cheap and plasticy. The speakers have no directional adjustments like angle or tilt at all to direct the sound. I was traveling during much of the 30 return window but just assumed that when I had the time to tinker with them I could tweak the sound to be full bodied and even. Unfortunately that didn't happen. I'm considering selling them on e-bay. Don't waste your money. Even Dell has switched to Logitech on their XPS system offering."
1,They only lived for 16 months,Do not buy. Sounded great but died just past the warranty period of 1 year. Klipsch has yet to respond to support questions after one week. Definitely no repeat business from me.
1,Great sound but they don't last,"Like so many others, I was blown away by their great sound. Truely impressive. But now after 2+ yrs, the amp is giving out. I'm getting the dreaded cut-out of sound. In my case, I'm losing just the highs. The sub is still pounding away. But be warned, only buy these if you're OK with tossing them in a yr or so..."
1,Klipsch 5.1 no great deal!,Yes this is a great sounding system and I wish I still had it but mine like so many others failed. I got over 2 years out of it so I guess I was lucky but the expense of having it repaired only to fail again has turned me off on Klipsch. Its too expensive for its short life span.
1,The amp has problems.,I have owned the Klipsch ProMedia Ulta 5.1 Multimdedia Speaker system for two years and the amp has failed. There is a serious problem with the amps and Klipsch should address the issue. Do not buy this system unless you are willing to pay over $300.00 for a few years of great sound.
1,Great sound but Amp is junk,"I have had two sets of these in the past 3 years only to have the same issue.The amp just blows up for know reason. I never ran these over half volume so there realy isnt any excuse for this.Klipsch refuses to acknowledge they have a problem and wants you to fork over $60.00 for repair, plus $35.00 for shipping to keep having them repaired.I finally got smart and went with a 7.1 amp and JBL speaker system.Beware if you buy these, They do sound great but wont last long."
1,Klipsch Customer Service?,Looking for a good example of the word oxymoron? Try Klipsch Customer Service. I have telephoned and emailed them 5 times and have never received a reponse. I would never recommend Klipsch speakers to anyone.
1,SUPERB sound... while they last,"Have the original ProMedia speakers, but research shows that my comments are relevant to the Ultra version.These are without a doubt the best speakers I have heard for the intended use (small room HT or PC music/movies) and price... Crisp, clear, sparkling highs, clear, tight, unmuddied bass... truly spectacular.... until they fail.The power supply is under-designed, and fails at a very high rate. More aggravating, Klipsch refuses to repair/upgrade the production components, and charges $90 to replace known failure prone components WITH THE SAME PART NUMBERS!A couple of years ago, I located a repairman (in Texas IIRC) who did an upgrade of the subject parts in the power supply, and have had no problems after the upgrade... Do not recall his name or address, but since this is a well documented problem, I suspect any qualified electronics shop could do the same thing for about what Klipsch charges for reinstalling the same failing parts."
1,Klipsch promedia ultra 5.1,"The Speakers worked for about 2 weeks, I thought it was something I did to cause them to go out on me. Because I still had the box for these speakers, I boxed it up and it has been sitting in my garage for 5 years. I just recently pulled it out to see if I could fix the problem. Everything works as far as speakers and subwoofers. What failed was the Circuit board on the Subwoofer. Now I am looking at trying to purchase the Circuit board. But after reading these reviews I will probably just buy a different subwoofer that has quality reviews and recycle the speakers into a whole new system."
2,Klipsch makes great SPEAKERS ONLY - My Amp just FAILED today!,"I've had the Klipsch Pro Media 5.1 Ultras for a few years now and it happened. I powered them up, usually hearing a thump of the sub, no thump! That's odd I thought. I Checked the volume control on the computer and it was all of the way up! I plugged in headphones into the soundcard output where I would normally plug in the speakers - the music blared out! Amp is dead! The system puts out a phenomenal sound when it works. The amp is a cheap piece of junk. Klipsch needs to find a better supplier for their amplifiers, or their great speaker reputation will be tarnished."
2,"Great Sound, but sub still has problems","I just wanted to throw in my two cents. I bought this system a little over a month ago (I didn't look at any reviews because my brother has been selling audio equipment for a number of years and told me this was a great system). This system does sound great, however three and a half weeks after I bought it, the sub stopped working. That's when I looked at the reviews online. Even though it's been almost two years since other reviews stated that Klipsch was aware of the problem and had corrected it, apparently there are still some flaws. I immediately boxed my system back up and returned it.This system does sound great, but if you are going to buy it, make sure you get an extended warranty."
1,poor customer service,It is not a complaint about the product. I could get no info on how many mud skins you received for the price. After chatting 30 minutes with Grace she stated one flap which is ridiculous. $400.00 for a set of Putco mud flaps? I ordered 2 a year or two ago and received 2 for less than 50 dollars. So I aked who I could complain to about the poor info and she hung up on me. I then called customer service and they quickly called me back. After about 10 minutes I was told you get two for the 94 dollars. Either way something has gone wrong with yourcompany. I just had to cancel an audio book that was to be delivered by August 31stand has not been delivered yet. What is going on? You used to be a great company and now you are in the toilet. Push people to E Bay!
3,200 meters?????,"I went down 15 meters with this watch and that's all she wrote-destroyed. Until than, I loved it"
1,Bad Design Watch,"This is a badly designed watch for an adult. From a functional point of view: 1) the crystal is too small, unless you turn in your wrist completely you cannot read the time; 2) when you use the lighting mechanism in a dark area, such as a theater or movie, the whole face is too dark and you can hardly read the time, 3) the circumference of the crystal should be bigger, otherwise promote it as a child's watch; 4) the two orange buttons make the watch look cheap, when it doesn't have to.Now a Positive: the mechanism works fine after a month, or so.Conclusion: I will refrain from buying something off the net, because i cannot see it before deciding. Michael"
5,Caught Fish,"I tried out these lures at lake Lahonton in Nevada. Supposed to be Wipers in there. For those that don't know, a Wiper is a cross between a Striped Bass and a White Bass. Tried worms last time we went, with no luck. Tried these and hooked and landed several Wipers. I am happy, not too easy getting fish out of that lake."
5,Great item.,Great item to catch trout. A good addition to any tackle box. I would recommend this to anyone. Good product for a reasonable price.
1,Firewire cardbus users be warned,this adapter will not work with the firewire cardbus cards made for the powerbook G3 series. Iomega tech supports says that they do not support third party devices. I would not recommend this product unless you have built-in firewire ports on your computer
3,Great book but the edition is awful,"This is a great (awesome) book but the problem is that the edition is horrible...there is even an error on the index! And the introduction is a ""copy-paste"" paragraph from wikipedia! In my opinion this is one of the worst examples of non existant editorial work."
4,Pure power-pop for the new millenium,"Coming out of the emo-rock scene, The Stereo represent a return to power-pop, the likes of hasn't been seen since Cheap Trick's hey-day. Hailing from Minnesota, home to The Replacements and Prince, The Stereo shows a love for arena rock bands like Journey, but with the smart songwriting of a Paul Westerberg or Rick Neilsen. The lead off track, 'Devotion' shows lead singer Jamie Woolford laying Rick Springfield style vocals over thick power chords, 'You've Got Some Nerve' crunches along, while 'Ramona' begs for an arena of screaming fans singing along. More sensitive numbers such as 'Please Try To Understand' shows wonderful piano from Woolford. Jaimie and the boys song's about relationships and girls can fall right beside anything by Matthew Sweet or Badfinger and not miss a beat. This album is as much fun as a rock album can get. Listen to them now, before they're filling your local stadium."
4,Great rock album,"This album features Rory from The Impossibles, and Jamie from Animal Chin, it is very creative, and if you like the impossibles or animal chin, you should buy this, although this is not a punk or ska album. This is pure, straight-forward rock, a la weezer. Rory is no longer in the band, and is back with the impossibles, and I feel that this is The Stereo's best album, with rory there."
2,Mediocre pop rock from Long Beach,"As one listens to the first few tracks of Nimbus Luna's ""Car Window,"" it becomes painfully apparent that NL are kind of a one-trick pony. Not that that in itself is bad, but their one trick isn't really that impressive to begin with. Sure, the Long Beach natives offer a generous blend of pop and rock set to singer Ron Legaspi's romantic lyrics, but as the record goes on, one has to check their cd player to make sure that the ""repeat one track"" button was not accidentally depressed on account of the songs sounding so similar. You might enjoy NL if you like Vertical Horizon or Lifehouse sans the heavy guitars."
3,Small Book better for older girls,I ordered this book for my three year old flower girl. The book itself was very small in size. I think it was difficult for small fingers to play with the delicate dolls. The pictures were very cute. Maybe a 6 or 7 year old would be better suited for it.
4,fun!,Good for any flower girl between the ages of 5 and 7. Sticker paper dolls are always popular with little girls
2,Not what I expected,"This book is very tiny (only 4 x 5 1/2"") with the flower girls being less than 5"" tall. There are only two little flower girls to dress- I didn't notice this in the item description until AFTER I had purchased the book. And all the clothing styles are very dated, even though it was printed just 4 years ago. Just not what I expected when I ordered this book. It's not terribly expensive, but if I had seen it in a bookstore I'd have passed it right up."
4,Great Gift for the Flower Girl in Your Wedding!,"We purchased these stickers as part of a gift for our Flower Girl. They went over very well - what little girl is not into stickers? There are a ton of great books, too, for flower girls and ring bearers. Check them out!"
5,Paper Dolls,The booklets were so cute. The girls loved them and played with them all day. An excellent value!
5,Martin's Day,product was brand new in perfect shrink wrapped conditionproduct worked perfectly and arrived in atimely fashion
4,Brand New Life,"Starring Cloris Leachman & Martin Balsam. This film as about a woman who is married to a much older man & discovers she's pregnant. She never intented to have a baby & searches her heart about having it. It's really not a bad movie, and Miss Leachman is at her beautiful best!"
4,It looks good...,It looks great and it's nice and sturdy. But.... Since I live in Oregon I can't use it. It seems quite hard to find license plate covers that you can use in Oregon. All because Oregon has you put the tags in the lower corners. Admittedly that entirely my fault for not noticing before I purchased it.
1,Cheaply made,This was a gift for my husband and son For their new trucks I was so Disapointed when my son put his on his truck and drove the emblem fell off on the street so my husband took a look at his to find that the steelers tag was attached with double sided tape so he superglue is emblem in place hoping it will work. Very Disapointed
4,Dissatisified With Amazon,Camera purchase okay and good camera. Very dissatisfied with Amazon as they canceled another order with no explanation. Will not order again from Amazon.
1,Flash problems with D40s and D40xs,"I bought the Nikon D40 10 days ago and the flash stopped working. I did some research on the internet, and apparently it is not an uncommon problem. I would have really liked the camera otherwise. I will return this camera."
5,Finally my search ends here !!!,My search ends here..for now. After hours together in search I finally ended in 2 products that I wanted to go for. Canon and Nikon were the 2 products that I ended with. I was not able to come to a conclusion of which to buy . After some debates with myself I settled for Nikon D-40 which I am not regretting or will never regret about. I have used this camera for the past few days and everything turned to be great..I haven't found a single issue with this one and am proud of owing it. I would advice any one to go for this and its worth getting it for that price..
5,LOVE IT! LOVE IT! LOVE IT!,"Having so much fun with this camera...took photos of my friends child's birthday party and they are so awesome. The camera is easy to use and the dvds are helpful. When you first get the camera, put in the Fast fun and easy DVD and it walks you through the set up!Battery life last a long time, too! Great upgrade from point and shoot. May need more time to pick the right lens and focus, but your photos will be so much more sharp and clear!"
1,Made no sense,"couldn't get pass the first chapter it was s bad, it was so bad that I just didn't want to waste my time reading amymore."
1,Uneventful,"The Black Thorne's Rose was little tame. No other emotions are expressed in this story. Not enough passion or sparks between the main couple. The characters are meek, the story line is lacking adventure. No group of characters to really dislike or love, root or cheer for. Too much time goes by without the main character's interacting with each other and when they do it very disapointing. They are too passive and accepting and down right uninteresting and boring. It Just didn't make me want to continue following Susan King's storis."
3,First book read by this author,"I wanted to read one of Susan King's books and decided on this one. While it was nicely paced, it was mediocre at best. The story line is one that is used over and over while some authors can make it work and add new panache to the story, this one was dragged on. I was able to skip several chapters and still know what was going on and where it was leading.How can you see someone in person and mistake their eye color or mistake them for someone else? It did not make sense and was not very well thought out.A good read, not a great one, will not go on my re read list. Nor does it inspire me to buy anymore books by this author."
5,Heart warming read,I could not put this read down until I finished it. I loved every minute of it. Thank you. Keep them coming.
2,A basic book on bread making,"This is a very short and to the point book. It starts out with a brief history of bread making, and then moves on to different bread types from around the world.I tend to dislike books like this. What I find lacking is information on what I can and can't do with a recipe, and what can make things go wrong.Apart from that, the recipes are very nice."
3,BRITE TEETH,"Not sure if it is working, it has been more than 2 weeks since started using it (devotedly- 2 times a day). So far, my teeth seems the same NOT britewhite."
5,Colts Reversible Hat,"Love the hat, it's just what I've been looking for.Great quality merchandiseThank you so much"
2,A VERY short history,"This book is basically a chronological list of the governors of Florida, with a little bit of general information about the state history mixed in, not much detail is used to illustrate any of the major points. This was required for a history course I took in college. I wish I didn't buy this book because there wasn't anything in it that wasn't covered better in the class lectures or could have been found online if someone missed class all semester."
4,A Decent Short History,"A book that matches up with it's title, it's a short history of Florida! It starts back in pre-Colombian dates and broadly (very broadly) covers the different nations that claimed parts of the state in it's history, the people, the agriculture, growth of population, cities, politics, etc. A good overview that would provide the casual reader many starting points for further investigation."
3,Very Nice,"It helps a lot with learning where things are because you have to find them, but it is so small and detailed sometimes I'm too lost with trying to stay inside the lines."
5,Review of The Anatomy Coloring Book,This book is excellent to teach young people anatomy as well as a reference book for all ages. I purchased the book as a birthday gift for my 15 year old granddaughter.
5,The most learning enriched coloringbook you'll ever find!,"I'm an 11th grader attending Norwich Free Academy currently taking AP anatomy & pysiology. This is one of those books, not required, but extrememely useful for surviving anatomy. With all the memorization, the coloring and written out labels w/ definitions, helps your out class grade so much. The visuals are so graphic and precise I find it has helped maintain a high gpa in the course. I would recommend this book for highschool & college anatomy students as well as for anatomy teachers. When the teachers print out the different coloring pages to assign for hw, as silly as it sounds, it infact helps w/ the whole physical concept. It is also a great break in between attempting Uconn Chemistry problems and reading about a bunch of dead guys in AP history. =P"
3,Expected a bit more,"There is absolutely nothing wrong with this product. It covers the material it says it will cover, so for that I was pleased at the very least. My expectations were simply a bit higher than what I received. The CD-ROM that is included does provide some forms and other useful items. Overall I would say this is a very basic book for someone who knows probably not much about the world of editing, writing and proofreading. If that is you, then it might be worth the investment. If you are a bit more further along, then this might be too elementary."
5,The McGraw-Hill Desk Reference helpful to writers as well as editors,"Here are the rules on how to write numbers, names, etc., and punctuation before submitting your work to editors! All of the rules which we were always unsure of. Do you write a number out or use numerals? How do you submit names? A helpful reference work. Barbara Fifield"
2,Difficult to use when following instructions,"My drill can't seem to soften this product enough to get it on the wheel. Perhaps you need a bench unit. The tube has to be peeled away so it can't be resealed. Very frustrating. Been to the dico site a number of times, followed the instructions, but no help. A picture or video would so much more helpful."
2,Try to get it out of the tube,"I thought that the tube that the rouge came in was a good idea. To just push what was needed out of the tube, use it, and then push the remaining back in for the next time. The rouge is so tight in the tube that it is impossible to push out. The tube had to be cut off and it is very tough. What were they thinking? Other than that, the rouge works well."
3,A little pricy,"I bought this a little while back to use on a strop for sharpening my knives. Well I later learned that jeweler's rouge doesn't work quite as well as a chrome-based polish. But I have no complaints about the actual product. It is what it claims to be. My only complaint is that I found the same product for cheaper at my local Ace hardware store, so I kind of regret purchasing it online. Oh well."
5,A must read for non-naturalists,"I was never fascinated with animal extinction. The reality of tigers being erased from the face of the earth never once crossed my mind until I read Richard's book. It paints a very bleak and pessimistic scenario about the decline of tiger population worldwide. His treatment is both scientific and philosophical. Man's dilemma is always to balance his own technological progress and the preservation of what God has made for him to enjoy. It will be a sorry affair if the tigers will eventually disappear in the wild. If you are not a naturalist, read it and you will soon empathize with thousands of them all over the world; a crusade that is a thankless job!"
3,Not for beginners,"A really authoritative course in Urdu with lots of useful cultural info as well. It puts you at the deep end and gets tougher. The main problem that will stop most beginners getting past chapter one is that they decide to use the nastaliq (complex cursive) script from the beginning. Given that ""ordinary"" cursive arabic script is tricky enough to get your head around this more elaborate form is a real obstacle. Even native speakers have to know the words in Urdu before they can pronounce them properly from this script so the benefit of this immersion method is not clear. They could have been gentler with beginners and had a few more chapters exclusively in roman script to ease them in.If you have a grasp of the language from other sources and want to use this to build up grammar as well as reading and writing skills this will do the job.Michael"
1,Not so good,"I found this book and CD combination hard to follow along with. As the CD played it was not clear what section of the book/page I should be following. I tried several times to figure out how to follow along, but eventually gave up and asked my Urdo speaking friend to help me. Therefore, ""teach yourself"" title is not really fitting.I think this product would be easier for a person who already has some background in middle eastern languages."
4,Good Reference,It is good reference for intermediate Urdu learner. It contains lot of scripts and dialogues enhancing learner understanding of the language.
2,Much too difficult for a beginner,"This book and cd are much too difficult for me as a beginner. Learning a language should be listening and visually see as object or know what a phrase means. Written language doesn't come to children for 5- 6 years after hearing and seeing words and phrase or listening to sentences and commands.It would be nice to have a series which teaches in this manner.I once bought a children's book in Egypt that had a picture of a shoe, then a picture of a crayon.then the word was spelled below Shugron = Thank You. If they would have the pronunciation along with the pictures and spoken slowly for the learner to hear, we wouldn't give up so quickly.This series is not as advertised for a beginner. Sorry!If anyone knows where I might find children's books here in the States like the one mentioned above, i would greatly appreciate it. Shugron."
4,A very helpful book,"I really like this book because it explains the grammar in a simple way and has good dialogues. But there are a few things that could be improved. One is the way they teach the Urdu script. I don't think they cover it so well although they use it alot in the book, also they don't teach you how to write it. It's not so easy when you actually try to make the words yourself. Also there is alot of emphasis on formal Urdu which is good to learn but they should also teach informal Urdu."
4,Me gusta (lo que llevo leido),"El libro está bastante bien. La clasificación de las lecciones es clara, las explicaciones son minuciosas y tiene diálogos con personajes simpáticos para ponerse en situación. Me gustan mucho los CDs, se escuchan bien y en poco tiempo empiezas a entender lo que dicen.En contra: está en inglés, por lo que al explicar la pronunciación de cada letra es algo lioso. El tipo de letra cuando escriben en urdu es muy pequeña y veces no se distingue bien."
5,"""The"" Pad","The wrist rest is comfortable, it works perfectly with optical mice, and it looks really cool. I've bought three of these so far (one I tore open to see what the wrist rest was made of, one for my home computer, and one for my work computer) and will never use another mouse pad as long as I have a choice."
1,WARNING! DOES NOT WORK WITH SOME ZIP 250 DRIVES,"I purchased this cable and also a Zip 250 USB Drive just like the product packaging said. However when I got it home my Zip 250 drive did NOT have the proper connector. I don't know which ones do. So, BEWARE!"
5,Pretty good.,"Not bad at all. These guys have some talent. Buy it, and the new one revive. Maybe when they get some attention they'll be as good as Oasis and start showing some personality."
1,Opened and 1/3 already used,"I am so shocked right now. I opened the box and found that the bottle was 1/3 empty and the seal at the top was broken. So, lemme get this straight.. I pay full price for a certain product, and they send me a used 1/3 empty bottle and they think everything is cool? No way, I e-mailed Amazon about this. It doesn't stop here, I'm pretty pissed."
3,too early to tell,"It's too early to tell how well this product will work on my tomatoes in the green house. Time will tell, I am in Arizona and will start my tomatoes in October"
2,Barely Usable,"This is my second Propad Gamepad, and it will be my last. Anytime I want to use it, I have to calibrate it every time. That's a nuisance, but not the only problem. If I don't calibrate it, and want to play a computer game that can be played with either keyboards or gamepads, the game always gets screwed up. One of the buttons doesn't do anything at all (and, according to my game, Fifa 99, the button should pass the soccer ball), and two others are switched. The only thing that works properly is the D-Pad. Basically, this is a piece of crap. I can use it, but only when I have to (for playing 2 player games.) The price is really cheap- and you get what you pay for. A really cheap, piece of crap."
2,"Guys... Gameport is dead, long live USB!","Nice d-pad, its the tried and true cross that's been on SNES and Sega, but WHY is it slanted? 6 Buttons, I guess you could make 2 of those be Start and Select. The shoulder triggers wouldn't suck if they were seperate buttons and not turbo's for E and F. And its a gameport pad... folks, we have USB 2.0 now. If you seriously want console ruggedness for your PC, stop wasting time/money on flimsy copycat PC pads! Get a Smartjoy adapter from Lik-Sang, download Joy2Key's free software, and dig any standard or aftermarket PS1/PS2 pad out of your closet. You'll have a familiar pad that will last you, and loads of Keyboard/Mouse Mapping options. I use mine on emulators and PC games that originally didn't support joysticks."
1,Jitters left to right with no relief in sight,"The pad jumps from left to right seemingly at random, drivers dont fix it, and there is no update anywhere that I have found (and ive been looking) Cant even find the companies website. Definately a DO NOT BUY, its not worth money, spend a little more and get something you dont wind up hateing."
1,Poor pad,"I bought this pad thinking that it would be a nice inexpensive way to play Madden 2000 on my PC. I was wrong. I installed the Drivers and tried to play but the pad had a mind of its own. There must be a defect, I have had it for two days and I am returning it. I tried to calibrate the pad, uninstall/reinstall, and troubleshoot it with no success. I know it is not my PC because I built it from scratch and there is no conflicts in the device manager etc,...."
1,Do not waste you money on this poor excuse for a pad.,"I first bought this pad thinking that I could get a cheap all-in-one pad for all my gaming needs. I was wrong. My first disappointment was the shoulder buttons. I hoped that they would be extra buttons, instead they turned out to be extra buttons for E and F. My second dissapointment was when the buttons started to stick. Not a fun thing when you're deep into a critical part of a game. The buttons are bothersome and take too much effort to get them to respond effectively. The directional pad is even worse. Its awkward setup only hindered my gaming progress. Even my four-button Gravis is better than this pad. Do not buy this pad. You get exactly what you pay for. Nothing."
1,waste of time and money!,"do not waste your time or money on this peice of crap gamepad, it looks alright for its price, but when it is actually being used it will act as if you pressed a button that you haven't pressed , and the D-pad seems to stick on the left, which results in no action whatsoever when you press the right button and it will cause your character to turn or move to the left when you aren't pressing anything....I thought it was just a defective pad, so I took it back and tried another one, it did the same thing, so I took the new one back and shelled out an extra $'s and bought a Microsoft Sidewinder Gamepad, I have been happy ever since....... The moral of this review, don't buy the PC Propad 6 there are much better controllers on the market, if you are a serious gamer wanting results I recommend the Microsoft Sidewinder Gamepad,it is a little more expensive but you get a lot more for the buck!"
1,Waste of money!!,I purchased a performance propad 6 it does not work.It's wacked i tell you.I followed the instructions on how to install it and it does things by itself without you pushing any of the buttons.When i push it to go down or to the right it doesn't move.I also purched Resident Evil 2 and it doesn't work with the game. It is just to hard to use the keyboard for that game.The only other thing i can do is take and return the game pad back to the store.To me both the Propad 6 and Resident Evil 2 was a waste of money.I can't use either one.
2,Impossible to defeat Soda Popinski with this controller.,"If you buy this controller, you will get what you pay for. The pad is slow to react, and there is no start button. On one of my computers it doesn't work at all, and on my Gateway(tm), it works only for some games.It is very frustrating to be beaten repeatedly in Punch Out by Soda Popinski because i can't dodge fast enough. (Death to Soda Popinski.)If you can afford it, you should splurge the extra few bucks, and buy a better controller than this."
1,Don't! InterAct is gone!,"Lousy quality caught up with them. Web site is gone, along with any hope of working drivers. I imagine they are out of business completely."
5,Works Great,I use this to do a final buff on Briar pipes. Works well. No issues and I have finished well over 100 pipes with it.
5,On the Level,"Shooting panoramic photos without a level is like hunting pheasant without a dog. I do not have a $300-$400 lens nodal arrangement, so shooting with at least an idea of having level horizon/ or vertical plane helps in getting lucky. This little gadget has been great, easily slipped on or off in Horz or vertical mode, compact and light weight to carry also. Works for me!"
4,Keeps me straight!,This spirit level aids in leveling the camera when it's on a tripod and is accurate. I did add a piece of tape to the mounting foot so that it fits tighter in the flash shoe.
4,Bubble Level Action,"The level works as designed. I have no issues with the way it works. However, the level is easily knocked from the hot shot slot. I would attache a cable orchain to the device , so it could be attached to the camera. I have lost a couple of these levels already and don't plan to replace this one , if it suffers thesame fate as the previous ones."
3,Don't make this your only study aid,"This book lacks depth on the following Exam topics: RDO, IIS, DHTML and Active X Documents. It does a pretty good job on MTS. The labs are good. The sample test is not good. Use this book in conjunction with another study guide, such as the Exam Cram book."
4,"A good preparation tool, but not covering everything","Just succesfully passed the 70-175 exam, so my impression is fresh. The book is a good preparion tool, but remember - it doesn't cover everything (I estimate it to 85%). Be prepared for following questions not covered here: 1. RDO - there is no one word in the book covering this topic, so refresh your knowledge about RDO. 2. Packaging and Deploying - expect several non-trivial questions not covered at all 3. Conceptual, logical and physical design - several non-trivial practice questions - I recommend reading the 70-100 Trainig Kit 4. Internet applications - several advanced questions, poorly covered in the book My preparation tools were: 1. The book 2. MSDN Articles 3. 7 years experience in VB 4."
3,It does the job,"I used this book to pass the exam. I scored 957. I did get a few questions in the exam that were either not covered adequately or not at all in this book. But, I do feel that the book did provide a solid resource for the key parts of the exam, i.e. ADO, MTS, COM and n-tier technology. I would only recommend this book to people that have a fairly solid background in VB and want to pass the exam."
3,Good enough to pass but...,"The practice exam on the cd was terrible and some sections are a bit patchy. If you buy the equivalent book for 70-175 you'll find that about 60% of this book is duplicated in that book. However, this book was my only resource and I passed the exam with just over 780. I think I could have done much better had I bought transcender."
4,Balancing Cactus Game from Plan Toys,I ordered this toy from Amazon for my 3 year-old granddaughter to play with at my house. She had long ago mastered colors and shapes but she enjoys the challenge of making different designs with this toy's pieces. She is not interested (yet) in playing with it as a competitve and sharing game--she just wants to do it by herself. She is grasping that she needs to balance the pieces to make the toy stand up and so she works on creating her designs with that in mind. I love that the toy is made of natural wood and painted with (safe) bright colors and that the pieces fit easily into the holes. The toy is not difficult to master but is still a creative challenge for a bright three-year-old.
1,broken butt cap,This was a beautiful rod and it arrived damaged; a broken butt cap. The rubber cap is sheared almost off the rod. The shipping box has no damage so the flaw existed prior to shipment. How could anyone pack the rod and not notice the damage?
5,Cradle King review,"I hadn't read much about James I so decided I wanted to find a book that covered his early childhood as much as his adult life as a king, given the turbulent and traumatic childhood he experienced. This work helped me understand how his personality developed in that environment and shaped who he became and the legacy he left his son, Charles I."
5,happiness is a good book,"this product was in excellent condition and came within a reasonable amount of time...am very happy with the result of this transaction, will buy again from this dealer.......book described in very concise words and fulfilled my expectations"
1,"Only Chinese audio, no subtitles.","Great movie... but the ""instant video"" is only in Chinese and there are no subtitles. So unless you happen to speak the language you should probably get it on CD."
4,Fearless Hyena,"Great Jackie Chan classic. However the TUTM Entertainment discs,many are defective and after the first hour,cube,scramble and stop.Too bad because this release is not in Full Frame(even though indicated)but Widescreen.Find an older Widescreen release and pay a little more to be sure of a better playback."
4,Fearless Hyena,"One of Jackie Chan's earliest movies and the first one he directed. It was typical Jackie Chan -- Kung Fu action mixed in with a lot of comedy. Of course the only drawback was that it doesn't really sound like Jackie, but it was still a good entertaining movie."
1,Amazon Instant Video has no subtitles or dubbing,The Fearless Hyena is in Chinese and has no subtitles or dubbing so unless you know Chinese you won't understand a thing. Makes you wonder whether all foreign films in Amazon Instant are like this....
2,FEARLESS HYENA,"THIS VERSION HAS BETTER PICTURE QUALITY THAN SONY RELEASED BUT ENGLISH DUBBING ONLY(DD 2.0 STEREO), NO SUBTITLES,NO TITLE MENU , NO SPECIAL FEATURE AND NOT IN FULL FRAME (2.35:1 ANAMORPHIC WIDE SCREEN).."
5,"It's exactly what it says is it is: -NOT- a ""chord book""{.","First of all, it should be known who Van Eps was: A guitarist who specialized in highly sophisticated chord-melody work, with an elaborate system of fingering harmonized lines to play them as perfectly, (without the squeaking most players get by merely sliding into positions), as is possible on the instrument. He called the guitar the 'lap piano', and his playing reflected that point of view. If this doesn't mean a lot to you, perhaps the other books some reviewers have mentioned will beall you need. If, however, you which to truly master the mechanics required for the musical performance of all of the possible harmonized lines on guitar, no other book is even -attempting- the objective. I love Ted Green, and his methods definitely provide a better 'quick fix' for less serious players, but let's not bow to our current limitations if we have the potential to take the next step."
5,Release The Beast,"First thing, first. Shane Macgowan is not on this album. Do not purchase this if you want Shane singing.That being said this is still a wonderfull album. I am not a big ""Live"" fan but the live CD is superb. The sound quality is top notch and the band is completely tight. The Popes are a great band, they mix the old traditional Irish with Modern rock perfectly."
4,Almost there.,"I read this for class the past semester and thought that while there are some really incredible circumstances discussed,(White quarterback, growing up multi-racial, and minority public servants) that some people were noticeably left out. Native Americans received a further blow of marginalization. (they were mentioned once as something of a prop) Also, the diversity among Black and Asian communities was very much ignored. I must say that it's obvious who the writers/editors are marketing towards in their readership, because many of the arguments continue some monolithic dialogues that haven't changed in 20+ years. Going into a work like this will take some serious analysis on the part of the reader to notice what I'm talking about, as it is written with an almost indistinguishable slant. The work has great potential for use as a teaching tool, but focus should remain on analysis rather than taking work verbatim."
5,The True Value of Courage and Strength,"This collage of independant stories revealed the courage of ordinary Americans doing extra-ordinary things. In each of these stories, the indiviuals challenged their own personal beliefs, and cultural and ethnic diffrences, to come together and build alliances that transcended race. This is the ideal of what true Americans are and the values of real patriotism and heroism foiled up into an amazing hardcover, that all peace-loving humanitarians should own. The NY TImes and Joseph Lelyveld, You get 2 thumbs up for this incredible work of art. My gratitude to you,Sincerly, Malik Padgett"
3,Not the best of the genre,"I subscribed to Lasen's magazine, AdBusters, for over a year. While I agree with his politics and ideals for the most part it is clear that Lasen isn't a typical scholar in this area. There are some parts of the book where I agreed with the point he was trying to make whole heartedly, but had to roll my eyes at the logic he was trying to use to persuade the reader. I would suggest something by Sut Jhally, Jean Kilbourn, or Naomi Klein if you're looking for a well reasoned argument for why advertising is destroying our lives."
3,"Makes some good points, doesn't follow them up well","Might have been better if he didn't repeat himself so much and then step on his biggest points in the end. Still, it's well written."
4,The Anti-Consumerist Manifesto,"Kalle Lasn has written a little manifesto in ""Culture Jam."" The book is a testament to the ideals of anarchic minimalism and simple living. While censuring the mass consumerism underway, he is quick to extoll a violent, outspoken overthrow of these mores. This is absolutely necessary reading for those interested in minimalism and anti-consumerism. ""Culture Jam"" does serve readers as an instructional guide to détournement and culture jamming. But I caution the underlying message of violence - or encouraging it.It's clear from the variety of books I've read on this topic that there are factions within minimalistic culture. Lasn's is a more forceful, activist perspective. I tend to gravitate towards more peaceful means of protest - the simplest: not buying things."
4,"Interesting thoughts, but...","I found it a bit ironic to be reading these ideas on a wad of pricey newsprint produced by corporate publishers and sold through a corporate book chain.I went to adbusters.com. I didn't find the ideas from this book expressed on the web site ( though you can buy his products there).IMHO it is pretty tough to start a revoloution, especially one based on changing the flow of information when you don't make such ideas freely available.If the author means what he writes why isn't he on college campuses giving free lectures on this material and organizing campus groups?If the author really believes in the message of this book I challenge him to make it freely available in downloadable and printable form from his web site.Maybe this book is itself just another consumerist amusement."
2,It's all fluff.,"I had to read this for an ethics class. The first part of the book brings up some great issues in society but then juxtaposes any real solution with stupid little ways to obfuscate normal functioning society. The ""solutions"" are useless tactics diverging from tangible results to more that of a dead performance art movement. The writing at the beggining of the book is good and motivational and all but the meat of the book fails to deliver anything the title promises. For the record, I got an ""A""."
4,"Very good, but wondering at times","After reading Culture Jam, I have to admit that I was not changed, only because, as it turns out, I already agreed with Lasn on many points. However, what he does form here are both moral and medical reasons to be alarmed at the ever increasingly comercialism we can see in most modern cultures. That being said, the book is not as precise as it could have been, wondering at times and seemingly not totally sure what each chapter is ment to be about. In short though, an interesting book that deserves to be read."
4,Angry but convincing,"A ""What's wrong with things"" book from the founder of Adbusters. Lasn's a radical, and has some radical views, but a lot of them make a lot of sense. He's more angry than someone like Wendell Berry, but his examples are more concrete. When I finished this, I felt like I needed to go do something. Very good."
4,Liberate yourself!,"Ever catch yourself humming one of those obnoxious advertising jingles that marketeers love to pollute the airwaves with? Ever wonder what the roads would look like without billboards every 50 feet? Or what your kids' schools would be like without fast-food sponsored contests? Or how your own life would be better if you could somehow escape a consumerist society? Well, guess what? You can't escape it. BUT--you can start to undermine it. You can throw monkey wrenches into the great cultural machine that stall and maybe even jam it. This book is a primer on how to do just that. With it as a guide, plus a little imaginative legwork on your part, you can liberate yourself from a culture bent on transforming you into a placid, passive, commodity addict. All you have to lose is your logo!"
5,"A wonderful, affecting novel","If you enjoy substantial, intelligent horror that contains genuine emotion, you need to read IN SILENT GRAVES. The story is by turns touching and creepy, and is always thought-provoking. This is the kind of book you should give to friends who claim they don't like horror on the grounds that horror is shallow and full of gratuitous gore (there *are* some graphic scenes in here, but each one of them is necessary to tell the story).Braunbeck has been horror's best-kept secret for far too long. If you are any kind of fan of fantasy and horror, I bet you would enjoy this book as much as I did."
3,Makes You Think,"Not something to read for fun, but an acomplishment nevertheless. While the prose didn't work for me, the plot, story and characters were well defined."
3,"Literate dark fantasy comes close,...","...very, very close, to being something special, but it falls short of the classic mark by a visible margin. Robert Londrigan, a television news anchorman, has worked hard building a happy life for himself and his pregnant wife, Denise. Then comes the Halloween night when he does the story on the baby born without a brain...and, returning home from a cooling off period after a fight about the story, Robert plunges into a nightmare where reality and myth become one. While In Silent Graves is undoubtedly a literate piece of dark fantasy writing (the layering of stories and literary references reminded me of Peter Straub's work), the book just wasn't that scary or unsettling to me. I think the author will go on to write more impressive fiction in the future."
3,"Explorer, good for body lift","I have a 95 Explorer. I installed the Hurst shifter for Rangers/Explorers that includes a shifter stick that places the ball slightly forward and lower than the stock shifter. This stick has been mentioned as a possible alternate, being taller and angled more aftward. I tried it briefly but found it was a bit too tall (but the aft position was good). The increased height puts the throw about the same as the OEM shifter, which is a disappointment after the short Hurst stick in the basic replacement kit. The stick height also made it feel like driving a Rat Fink car (not really that bad, but definitely closer to the dash). All-in-all, I like the original stick in the Hurst shifter better. That said, I think would use this stick for Explorers with a 2"" - 3"" body lift kit."
5,Lisa at her best,"I love Lisa Ono, I think I have all her CD's, and like any artist, her CD's have good songs and not so good songs. Well, this CD is absolutely solid, there is not one weak song on this CD. This is the CD you want in your collection."
3,"Better and faster than floppies, but recommend USB Drives","I've use zip disks for about a year now. Have to admit that at least i haven't had to worry about scratching them up like CDs but they're not all that dependable when transferring from computer to computer. The only reason i really used them was because I had to for my multimedia class in college. They only equipt a few of their computers with CD Burners and most have Zip Drives. Out of the 5 zip disks i used, 2 of them had problems which have caused me to spend extra time redoing corrupt files for class. While they work pretty well if u want to be able to carry some files around with you in your pocket or just toss it in your backpack, i dont recommend using zips to transfer your work between many computers such as for computer labs. USB ThumbDrives for me. They are solid state, fast, and dont corrupt as easily if at all."
5,Corruptions? That's weird.,"Really weird. I bought a USB 250MB disk drive kit because the school computers have zip drives. I've been using the same two 250 MB disks for about 2 years now, and they've worked fine. I used it to transfer files between school (WinXP) and my home computer (Linux).I think CDS are great for backups, but not for file transfers. Even CDRWs aren't good for that since you have to copy all the files to your PC, blank the disk, and write the files back to update the disk. Sure we have those UDF formatted CDRWs that work like any other storage device, but THAT is unrealiable, and WinXP doesn't even support it by default.Memory sticks, hmm, they are compact, but they use EEPROM, which means that you are limited in the number of times a memory location can be erased. CDRWs suffer from a similar erase limit, but I've had the same CDRWs for many years, and they still work.I think the zip 250 disks are great, though I wish they were a bit cheaper."
1,I wouldn't recommend Iomega Zip Drive,"I have used Iomega Zip since the early days of parallel Zip 100. As an IT Professional, I need my portable storage to be fast, convenient and 100% reliable. Unfortunately, the USB Zip 250 and 750 drives I possess are none of these things! The disks corrupt often and catastrophically - it is really frustrating, as the potential flexibility and convenience of this format is great.Go the CD-R or CD-RW route, or even better, use something solid-state, but don't buy this product."
1,"Iomega disks, what a joke...","Iomega disks have to be the worst form of storage media ever created. They are easily corruptable. I can't tell you the number of disks I've had to throw away because they have died on me. They've destroyed projects that I've saved on them. Projects that were unretrievable because all of a sudden the disk cannot be read by the computer or even worse freezes the computer.On top of all this, Iomega disks are way too expensive for being such a bad product. I even had to ask an Iomega technician what I was doing wrong. After going over possible scenerios of what I've might of done, we both concluded it wasn't me but indeed there was something wrong with the disks.My advice is to stay away from Iomega disks and all other Iomega products and go with CD-RW disks of any brand. They store more info, are much cheaper and are much more reliable."
4,The most convenient way to back up files,This is still the most convenient way to back up files used on a pc. Word files and Excel files are easy to backup. It even backs up quicken files.
1,"Very Slick, But...","Eric believes that evolution is all wrong. So, this book's content teaches that the dinosaurs coexisted with humans.There are some people who think differently. In fact, most people think differently.If you are someone who believes evolution exists, you might be put off Christianity because of the content of this book and Eric's message.But don't fret, Eric's view is just Eric's view, even though he thinks he got that view from the Bible.The fact is, the Bible teaches that God made everything that exists.If you think evolution exists, then the Bible is telling you that God made it.You CAN be a Christian and accept evolution, Big Bang, Old Earth, Quantum Mechanics and anything else that people might think exists- As long as you accept God made everything that exists.If evolution exists, God made it."
5,Excellent Book!,This is a great book! I got it from our public library and now I want it to keep at home! This book is a wonderful relief to the evolutionist view...It is Christian and proves that man and dino lived together.Please read and give your children a chance to know the truth!!!
1,More Creationist Garbage,Please don't do your children the -huge- disservice of poisoning their minds with creationist nonsense. Evolution is a fact. To say otherwise demonstrates blatant willful ignorance.Give them a real science book. Not this.
1,I wish this book was part of every school's library,"I'm sorry this book has such a negative review prior. It's beautiful and full of hard core proof that dinosaurs and humans co-existed. I'm disappointed that the evolutionists seem to have so much power to hide the information presented in this book. This information is also available in the Bible. Get the book and research the information presented for yourself,it's all real."
3,Rage and Reflection,"With their third release The Way I Feel Today, Six by Seven tempers their feedback frenzies long enough to explore a newfound attraction to melody. Chris Olley's vocals are reminiscent of Coldplay's Chris Martin (though The Way I Feel Today was released internationally before Coldplay's latest), and some of the music has a dreamy compression worthy of The Church at their best. (One song - ""I.O.U. Love"" - owes more to The Church; namely, royalties for stealing the melody of ""Under a Milky Way"".) Fans of the band's crash'n'burn won't be disappointed; half these tracks clock in at a speedy 2 minute average. You'd think the effect would be schizophrenic, but it's far from it. The reflective songs are there to remind us what we do after the rage is spent."
3,Even the Children of the Rich and Famous Can be Alcoholics,"Unlike most of the other reviews, I did like this book. However, it is true that it was superficial - Cheever has an equally ""addictive"" problem with men, in my book, but doesn't really examine it. Also, I learned a lot reading about her father's recovery from alcoholism, but she should have examined this more in depth. I did like the early part of the book where I was educated about the early settlers of our country, and how booze was so VERY important to them. A much better-written examination of a female alcoholic is the book: Drinking: A Love Story. That book was excellent, from beginning to end. However, there were a few stand-outs in this book: whenever I drink champagne, I always remember what Cheever said, that she thought it wasn't really booze, so that therefore she wasn't really an alcoholic, ""because it was bubbly"". As a non-alcoholic, these comments showed me the ""illogical logic"" of an alcoholic."
1,Misleading title,"In reviewing a book, one must have a basis from which to start. In considering Cheever's book, I cannot fathom where to start a conclusive review because the entire title of the novel is completely misleading. My intent in reading this autobiography was to learn more about an alcoholic firsthand, in her own words. Unfortunately, there was very little substantial material written about alcoholism, its effects, repercussions, etc. In fact, had that title been different I would have probably enjoyed this bland book about a woman's life tinged with alcohol, among many other things which were given just as much attention in the book. Therefor I find it useless to judge this book because it is based on so many vacant concepts."
1,Just plain bad,"The autobiographical drinking story has been done many times before, so the subject matter here is nothing new.What's so striking different about this book is that there is almost no self-reflection. It's just a compilation of what Susan Cheever drank, the places Susan Cheever drank, the men Susan Cheeer screwed while she was drunk. We'd get much the same result of Susan had gone to Kitty Kelley and asked ""Will you write a shallow, vapid account of my life?""Note Found In a Bottle is self-absored and boringly so. I imagine what keeps Susan awake at night is that most people have found this account of her drinking years Not Very Interesting. She earnestly wants the reader to believe her life was glamourous, but in fact it's just an average drunk story.I guess there are worse ways to spend (money) than to throw it away on this book....but not many."
1,Awful-Nothing like cashing in on Daddy's name,"I started this book hoping to find a thoughtful, absorbing account of how somebody can sink into alcoholism but ultimately survive. Was I off base. What I found instead was a lurching, unfocused, egocentric chronicle of all of Cheever's various love affairs and famous people she would just happen to bump into for lunch. The first few chapters, when she talks about the origins of her alcoholism and how widely social drinking was accepted in the 50s and 60s, are moderately interesting, but the book quickly degenerates from there into a litany of name-dropping and sexual escapades. Who cares? If she was trying to impress readers with her supposed attractiveness, I think she needs to wake up and get a life. Not only is her egocentricity and immaturity overwhelming. At one point she compares herself to Shirley Jackson-I wanted to ***. If this book hadn't been written by someone with a famous name, it never would have seen the light of day."
1,no truth here,"Susan Cheever has written a superficial, narcissistic account of her life as a drunk. Even as she purports to be giving a tell-all account of her years of drinking, as a reader I had the feeling that she wrote nothing that she thought would make her appear ""uncool"". Plenty of name-dropping and anecdotes designed to illustrate just how hip she really is, drunk or not. There must have been plenty of disgusting episodes not revealed here. More to the point, the author as yet doesn't realize just how unhip a drunk can be and presents her story as a romp through jet set life, glossing over the devastation I'm sure she left behind. The people who wrote the blurbs for the jacket have lost my respect forever."
1,How sad for her children!,"Like many other readers, I was appalled by Cheever's book. Her self-absorption and narcissism seem to have survived her drinking days. This book would be merely another volume in the ""me first"" series of self-revelatory accounts we've had to endure lately, except that there are children involved. Cheever seems to have given no thought to her kids' welfare as she moved from place to place and man to man. Her confessions of faith at the end of the book are totally unconvincing. She's revealed herself to be an immature and irresponsible woman."
1,Should be 'My Life as a Name Dropper',"This book is a huge disappointment. I kept reading it because I kept expecting it to get better, to have a point, to go somewhere. It's an example of really bad writing by a woman whose ego keeps getting in the way of what could be an interesting story. I was hoping to find a book I could recommend to someone who is trying to stay sober; instead I will tell her to run as fast and as far from this drivel as possible. The one positive thing I've gotten from it? If this woman can be published, there's hope for me!"
1,Surprisingly bad,"I recently purchased Note Found in a Bottle : My Life As a Drinker by Susan Cheever, despite the awful reviews posted here. I thought, it can't be that terrible. But it is. It truly is absolutely dreadful. It reads like a tabloid newspaper one might skim at a supermarket checkout counter. It just didn't feel real or truthful or honest to me. I'm sorry to say that I must agree, this is one book better left on the shelf."
2,Is it the alcohol... or Cheever?,"I raced through this book, believing I would arrive at the place where Cheever would see herself clearly, judge herself more acutely, and change her life. Ten pages before the end, she ""finds God""--which seems to mean something rather amorphous and unchallenging. It's not clear, because, though Cheever has given us all the details of her lousy relationships, she refuses to say much about why she stopped drinking. When the writing isn't too New-Yorker-precious, it's good; you are immersed in a culture of drink. But I concluded that it was not alcohol causing her problems, but Cheever's self-absorbed personality. And her judgment hasn't improved: she says she was married to three ""extraordinary"" men, but the two who fathered her children don't seem like great husbands or fathers. An odd book, unsatisfying and full of name-dropping."
1,"This book is self-absorbed, sloppy, and profoundly ugly.","Susan's Cheever's surname seems to have blinded most of the professional reviewers to the true nature of this book. The tone is whining adolescent, the prose is appalling, when it isn't incomprehensible, and her ""insights"" beggar description. It is sloppy and trivial, and reveals the author's true nature much more clearly than she realizes. Her self-absorption is perfect. She seems to feel she is a wonderful person who was led astray by alcohol. Quite obviously, she is a dreadful person who behaves even worse when she is drunk. Her accounts of her various marriages and love affairs make quite clear her total indifference to the anguish she has caused in her single-minded pursuit of happiness. Perhaps the reviewers read a different book?"
1,Comment on Note in a Bottle,Cheever's book is one more in a list of banal works she has produced. When will she stop?
2,"Still Daddy's Girl, and Cashing In On It","I read this book in a single sitting, which was all it deserved. Could Susan Cheever possibly love herself more while claiming otherwise? The name dropping, the cashing in on her famous name (would we care if this was an anonymous drunk rather than the scion of a genius?), the relentless references to her good looks and the aphrodisiac effect she apparently had on men throughout the world...yawn. I found Carolyn Knapp's book far more compelling. Cheever takes a plodding, self-important tone in her writing that I associate with the worst of women's magazines. What a dissapointment."
1,"Skip this book and read ""Drinking: a Love Story""!","I read this book because I thought it might give me some insights into fighting alcoholism- especially fighting alcoholism as a woman. I also expected that, in addition to the insights I could enjoy beautiful prose. I did not get any insights and there was very little that was beautiful in the prose. Forget this book and read ""Drinking: A Love Story."""
2,Annoying memoir of drinking,"You know when you're in AA meetings and there's that person who just blah-blah-blahs aimlessly about herself and everyone else is bored? That's fine for an AA meeting--it's important for us to process out loud in that forum--but it's not fine for a memoir. It's not that there is no value in this book, in the way that hearing other alcoholics' stories has value...but where is the craft? What is Cheever saying that someone else hasn't said better? This writer would never have been a writer if not for her famous name. Or, maybe if she hadn't had the famous name to fall back on, she might have actually developed her craft. As memoirs of drinking lives go, skip this one and try Augsten Burroughs' DRY or Caroline Knapp's wonderful DRINKING: A LOVE STORY."
2,Post - it in a Bottle,"Though ""Note"" is neither deep or introspective, it was easy to read with occasional excellent lines. My favorite (which made the whole book worth it for me) was ""It's not that I had a miserable childhood -- I didn't -- it's that I was a miserable child.""The memoir is interesting in its very ordinariness: except for her father's fame which gave her access to more wealthy and famous people, her life, her affairs, her alcoholism and her recovery were unremarkable.Though I enjoyed this book, it was more like an after-school special on the dangers of alcohol (you will forget things, have big fights, and sleep with many men) than an illustration of alcoholism or even the life of Susan Cheever. She admits some things, such as God, and apparently her feelings about her father, are ""too private"" to explain. Perhaps so, but then why write a memoir?"
2,Easy and fast style to read but lacking content.,"Unless you're interested in this particular family, time and money could be better spent with a good magazine article of your choice."
3,I have had better.,"The quality of the buffing wheel is just fine and it does a good job buffing my stainless steel exhaust tips I had scratched. I was not happy with the fact the centers were not set into the wheels, though, as they came in two pieces and were not the inside diameter that matches my grinder shafts. I would not get these again because of that, although they did accomplish what I needed to do. I have purchased other buffing wheels from Amazon.com that had the centers integrated and were of the proper shaft size."
4,Buffing,"This buffing wheel works well on my benck grinder for polishing items to a nice lustre. Make sure that you use the appropriate buffing compound for the type of item you are buffing, or could produce less than satisfactory results. Don't push the item too hard against the buffing wheel!"
4,Spiral sewn buffing wheel - good result,"I ordered the wrong size for my Ryobi 6"" but with a couple washers it fits fine. I was buffing my Spyderco Endura - looking good in spite of 0.5"" wheel width but then was distracted for a moment - bam! the Endura edge cut past the 1st sewn line - all digits intact, Endura suffered 1mm bent edge. Went to depothome got Ryobi buffing combo pack - 3 buffing wheel rough,mid,fine 6""x1"" for twenty bux. Ryobi wheel sewn lines are concentric but seem to work fine."
1,No Credibility,If there are any doubts on the credibility of Decker see the details of this book at-http://www.digitalpla.net/~russ/decker-handbook.htm
1,"MR. DECKER, A BITTER MAN FULL OF LIES",Mr. Decker was kicked out of the Mormon Church for committing adultery. That is why is so bitter and set against destroying the religion. His motives in writing this book are clearly revenge and money. Don't waste your time reading this book. It is full of lies.
1,Pathetic,"Mr. Decker's hatred for his former religion would not let him fairly evaluate the work of the LDS Church. Although he found Christ in another place, it is not fair for him to exclude 10,000,000 members of the LDS faith, and their acceptance of Jesus. Even though the LDS people accept Christ in a different way than is reguarly accepted by his brand of Christianity. I believe those people believe that their acceptance and dedication to their savior is real. I do not believe it is fair to use so many obscure sources that are not generally available, or in the Cannon of the LDS Church.I regret I bought the book or wasted my time reading it. I feel like Mr. Decker distorted this faith in a mean spirited vengeful manner. I believe he would do better preaching Christ than tearing down the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints."
1,Half-truths and opinion,"Ed Decker is a bitter enemy of the mormon church, he was kicked out for commiting adultery. If the church is bad for doing that, then so be it. He was later reinstated and kicked out again for the same reason. So his life mission is to bad-mouth the church. Look at all the good the church does in the world and look at Ed Decker. His book is about revenge, not unbiased research. Please, mr. Decker, get a life."
1,The Book of Mormon - The complete handbook on Mormonism,"If you want to know about Mormonism, attend one of their numerous churches. Read their scriptures. Befriend a member. Why base your beliefs on a guy who is obviously seeking out some kind of vengence? Stepping on too many Mormon toes? Most Mormons are completely comfortable with their religion, what they're not comfortable with are people that lie and deceive. Is it easier to quickly say, Mormonism is false. Or is it easier to take some time to look into it for yourself? Right. So when it comes down to it, anyone reading and agreeing with an Ed Decker book is not looking for answers, rather fuel for their own ignorance. It is clear. Anyone that supports Ed Decker falls into that category and makes themselves look equaly foolish. But I don't know, maybe the protestants are upset that the LDS church is stealing members of their congregation. I swear, if you read the Bible, then you don't understand it. ""By their fruits ye shall know them""."
1,found book uninformative,found the author rather opinionated and not in reality with mormonism.Ed Decker needs to get his facts straight.
1,Hate and deception,It is clear that Mr. Decker is filled with hate for the Mormon Church. His son has said that his father is still bitter for being caught in adultery and being excommunicated from the faith. He'll tell as many lies as he can to get even. It's sad.
1,Wasted Time And Talent,"This Like All of Mr Decker's Books is the distortion of a man angered by his previous religion. If I had nothing better to do with my time I could compile Libraries full of books tearing down my former Church. I am a temple attending Mormon that first came to know Christ in the pews of a Southern Baptist Church and accepted Jesus Christ as my personal Savior at the alter call of the great Billy Graham. I am still a born again Christian and am not in conflict with anything I have ever believed by being a Mormon. I will contend against no religion for Free Agency to worship God as God Guides ME to do does not give me the right to tear down and condemn others beliefs. I only wish Mr. Decker Could Use his time ,energy and talents for the building up of the Church he has chosen to worship our heavenly father in instead of attacking the church that he left behind."
2,Humorous at best.,"I highly recommend this to anyone well grounded in LDS theology and who has a sense of humor. For those individuals, it will provide many hours of laughter. If you lack the former you will learn little, as it is biased at best. If you lack the latter, the out right lies, prevarications and falsehoods it contains will make you angry."
1,"""Complete"" is true if the title was about misinformation!","This book is a poor read. But that doesn't even cover the fact that it offers little substance about the Mormon faith. However, Ed Decker remains true to his form of promoting misinformation about a religion which is already highly misunderstood because of people like Decker who are known as ""anti-Mormons."" Much of this book is repetitious of Decker's other works, so you'll get little new material. NOT recommended, unless you are a Mormon who enjoys humor in your life by reading Decker"
1,waste of money and time,Mr. Decker is full of lies. This book does not accurately portray the LDS Religion!
1,he shows how stupid he really is,"simple and direct, he is fighting against a ""mormon"" church that doesnt even exist."
3,"Nice kit, but cheap case","Happy with this kit and really like that it is made in the USA and the price is fair. However, the cheap plastic case wouldn't close properly and was of such poor quality that it takes away from the kit. Seems companies who make decent tools don't think twice about putting them in a Harbor Freight-style plastic case. If you have nice tools, put them in a nice case."
4,Thread Restorer kit,"Good buy has both Fractional and Metric. Made well, lots of sizes to help you get the job done."
4,Personal Accounts From The Battle of Britain,"This book pulls together personal accounts of luftwaffe fighter and zerstoerer pilots from the Battle of Britain. While the books attempts to focus on the luftwaffe it also contains many RAF accounts and pits both sides of the story together of individual fighter engagements from the battle. The result is a personal, and harrowing account of the battle showing the intensity and sacrifice at which it was fought. The author also summarises within these personal accounts the overall picture of the day(s) fighting that helps put things back into a strategic perspective. The end result is an enthralling account of the Battle of Britain supplemented with many photographs that is hard to put down. I would recommend this book to anyone with an interest in the Battle of Britain and would like to note that there is a further book by the same author along the some theme 'The Luftwaffe Bombers' Battle of Britain'."
5,Great Movie,This is a good movie with some great acting. I think every family should see this movie.
1,NOT a family movie,"For those who reviewed this as a family movie...a family movie this is not! I consider a family movie to be something the whole family can enjoy; a movie that is appropriate for the entire family to watch - toddlers, pre-schoolers, school age, middle school, high schoolers, and adults alike. This movie shows a woman taking a bath, a man taking a shower, and explains that a condom should be put on the penis. Any movie with sex education in it, is not good for the entire family to watch. I can't comment on the entire movie as once they showed the scene where the teachers tells them about condoms, I turned the movie off. I was watching this movie with my nine year old daughter and had to turn it off. This movie would be a good movie for 13 and up and should hold the ratings of PG-13."
3,Good family movie,I remember watching this on the disney channel. I enjoyed it then so I decided to buy it. Its more of a teen movie but the whole family can enjoy this.
3,"Poor Main Title Audio Presentation from M-G-M..otherwise, FINE !","This film gets 3 stars as I enjoyed this classy, slow-paced thriller and the good cast. Mostly, though, my biggest pleasure was Georges Delerue's melancholy music score, particularly at the end and in the main title credits. Unfortunately this print has parts of the title music GARBLED -- UNFORGIVEABLE since this score was never released commercially and cannot be savoured anywhere except on this DVD. Thumbs down to M-G-M for their careless audio presentation (fortunately I have a home-made DVD from an Australian friend with PRISTINE audio on the main title; couldn't M-G-M get a print from there??)"
4,A decent adaptation,"I enjoyed this film, and thought it was a decent adaptation of the book. The acting and production values were very good. There were some major plot changes, so a purist would find fault with it. In fact that is why I gave it 4 stars instead of five. However, the spirit of the original adventure remained intact. Some of the action may be a little intense for the under 5 group, depending on the sensitivity of the child, but other than that it was a good family film."
5,"Ah, the Highlanders!","This movie is incredible! Being of Scottish descent, my boys and I were excited to watch this movie; simply on that fact. However, what we found was adventure and excitement beyond our own imaginings... we found the Highlands and the Highlanders!Everything about this movie shouts, FIGHT FOR FREEDOM! We first encountered this movie almost 10 years ago, and are still watching it annually (at least). I have sons and they are warriors at heart (aren't most boys?) Kidnapped has captured that warrior spirit and packaged it in an epic film. Huzzah!The adventure, the scenery, the filming, and particularly the choice actors and actresses in this film make it a classic and a must own for any family. I think RLS, himself, would be proud of this one!~ I am a mom and a teacher."
2,Very Drawn Out,This movie was an ongoing struggle between attention and yawns. I finally realized I didn't like the movie after it had several times moved to a new scene and I wanted it to end. Perhaps just another case of ruining a movie by reading the book first.
1,What a pile of Doggy Doo!,"Ok, I really don't understand what people like about this movie. After reading the book and enjoying it very much I thought it would be nice to see the characters acted out. I was wrong. I didn't expect it to follow the book exactly (what does?) but this just dumps all the things that made the book good and focuses on points that really had nothing to do with the heart of the story. It should have been about a friendship forged from extreme perseverance and adventure. It just ends up being a poorly organized sequence of events with a wrap up thats less than interesting. I actually ended up not likeing the main character of the movie. Thank goodness Treasure Island didn't end up like this!"
3,Kidnapped,"This version of this old Robert Louis Stevenson classic is well worth seeing. I still must admit I prefer the acting in the Disney version and wish it too was available on a Region 1 DVD instead of requiring US customers to buy a multi-region player and Region 2 disc in order to view it. This rendition has a good cast and does a great job of showing how hard the times were in Scotland during this era of British rule. It does a fine job of showing how people mostly ran to get from one place to another. There were few horses and carts there then. It has a more realness to it but Disney's slightly lighter look at it is good too. I highly recommend this be rented before buying to make sure you enjoy this darker version of the story. Good quality DVD with few features and decent replayability. If you enjoyed this catch ""Luis Brunel's Robinson Crusoe"".CA Luster"
5,Well worth your money and your time,"This is an excellent movie. The characters are developed well, and the plot keeps moving along while allowing for meaningful dialog. Although I don't remember all the details of the novel, this movie impressed me by how closely it followed the storyline of the novel. It has a satisfying, happy ending but lots of conflicts to resolve on the way to it, plus some romance. My wife and I stayed engrossed in the movie and will be watching it again before long, so that we can pick up some of the details we missed. Except for some of the violence, this is a family movie (at least for children 12 and up). Armand Assante's performance was totally convincing- an excellent portrayal."
4,Entertaining and well-acted,"Okay, I'll watch anything with Brian McCardie in it because he's just too good and Scottish to pass up. He has the face and demeanor of the ideal Davie Balfour, and he's just a joy to watch as he puts his own spin on one of my favorite childhood story characters. Armand Assante as Alan Stewart is erm, okay but the accent leaves much to be desired and who was his costumer? The guy's gotta make for the heather and elude his enemies in a big tri-corn with wiggly white feathers on it. It's a little cartoonish, but he drew me in and I can overlook it. The rest of the cast is a delightful collection of characters seen in every Masterpiece Theatre production somewhere. Good fun and not just for kids."
1,Soul Stories,&#65279;This book by Gary Zukav is a complete waste of time. It's just a rehash of his really wonderful other books. The book merely recites fairytale-type stories of folks who have experienced supposedly unexplainable events in their lives.Gary is capitalizing on his reputation and writing this book merely for profit.
3,Somewhat disappointed,"After having read The Seat of the Soul, and been totally blown away by the ideas presented, I did not expect the let down that Soul Stories turned out to be. I had expected this, companion book, to dig deeper into the philosophies presented in the first book, but by comparison this is a much shallower, more commercial book, where little supplementary wisdom can be found."
5,This book changed my whole outlook on life...,"I was at a mall and walked into the bookstore. I saw Gary's book Soul Stories, and something told me to buy it. So I did. (I don't buy books this way, believe me!)I read it in 2 days and then read it again over the next week, and am now on my third reading. This book touched my heart like no other. It's easy to follow and understand. It makes SO much sense! I'm buying it to give as a gift to 2 of my friends."
2,Ho Hum,"A bit too self-indulgent for my tastes. Told me a lot more about his life than I cared to know (especially since it wasn't all that exciting). Full of aging-hippy platitudes. I could almost smell the incense burning. Former aggressive, military type finds true happiness by getting in touch with his inner child, loving everybody and chewing on tree bark and weeds. Yadda, yadda yadda. We can expect the infomercial any day."
2,whatever,"This book starts out building one assumption on top of another, and the assumptions are not backed up, they are taken for granted.I was disappointed."
2,Sleepy Stories,"I enjoyed Seat of the Soul much more than this work, due to the repetition in concepts. The stories help explain Zukav's concepts for someone that has not been exposed to much metaphysics, but a more versed person could find it to be overly worked and lacking of inspiration. There will always be a new author on the block reworking the same concepts with new fluffy words; unfortunatly, Zukav could have left this one off the public printer. Good for bedtime reading, you'll be out like a light in no time."
4,"A good companion to ""Seat of the Soul""","I really enjoyed this book, but not as much as Seat of the Soul. I think because I read SOTS at a time when I needed to make a change it spoke to me more than this book did. Maybe if I read Soul Stories last winter when I was in need of some healing, this book could have had the impact on me that Seat of the Soul did. Anyway, it's a book of 52 stories that all show how to reach authentic power through multi-sensory perception. One has to believe in these things in order to be receptive to this book's lessons. If you aren't sure if you are ready for his philosphy, check out Gary Zukov's visits on Oprah. She turned me onto Seat of the Soul and Gary Zukov, and now I never miss an episode when he is on. If his take on life jibes with you, read both books and begin your journey toward authentic power."
5,A Fellow Soul Teacher and Traveller!,"As a psychotherapist, author and 25 year seminar trainer on life strategies, I have often quoted Gary Zukov's ideas in my classes and to my clients. What most pleased me about Soul Stories is Gary's own story... his personal journey and struggles. He models authentic power for me in his vulnerability and openness. His honesty helps me to honor my own strengths and weaknesses. He is right when he says that our lives are movies and we need to be not just passive actors, but the directors. I would like to add that we need to be open to the wonders of the universe and that everything good and bad is a gift. And if we have faith in these gifts and are aware of what we are feeling and doing, we can create the life we want and are meant to have."
2,Soul Stories,"It is just what it says. Problem is, a bit contrite in its 52 lessons, some of which seem forced. It is as if pressure to publish resulted in an occasional unconvincing vinette. I got more from the table of contents as an indication of what the author was trying to convey than the actual essays following. Gary, if you read this, Seat of the Soul is perfect. Spend your time getting the message out, no need for additional verbage."
4,Wonderful place to begin . . .,"I acquired this set of CDs to listen to while on a long-distance drive. They are very interesting and enjoyable. Zukov teaches moral principles with a series of parables--a long established tool for teaching. The principles he teaches this way are pretty basic, but foundational for us all. For those who feel they're more ""advanced"", remember that we ALL benefit from review and reminder on the basics. When he got to the subject of men and women that, at times, he came from a more narrow, ""traditional"" position, which saddened me. This seems to be the one area where he hasn't put away at least some of old fashioned but not necessarily good or helpful attitudes. Otherwise, I must say, this is worth your time. Parents, it will certainly give you additional resources for helping your children understand as well."
2,Over My Head,"I was so looking forward to reading this book. Having seen Gary Zukav on the Oprah show and listening to his concepts, I couldn't wait to read it.What a disappointment! From the first page I was lost. I didn't have a clue what he was talking about. This book could have been written so people could better understand it.I tried and tried to follow what he was saying, to no avail. I consider myself a reasonably intelligent person and was frustrated with my inability to absorb what Zukav was trying to say."
3,Divided,"I don't doubt the sincerity of the peolple and their stories contained in this book or the depth of feeling for their experiences,but a lot of the events described in the book can almost all be chalked up to coincidence.One lady had a premonition that an accident had befallen someone then later came to find that her gut feeling was right.But we all have had dreams and intuitions that come to be,and of course we remember those,because it is so unusual.However,we forget the countless dreams,hunches,premonitions and gut feelings that turned out to be nothing but our overactive imagination.Whether or not the stories and experiences recounted in this book are divine messages matters little.Like the near death experience or some other life changing occurence,what matters is that people took the experience as a sign to be better people,more giving,less selfish, and leaves them more hopeful and peaceful in the mind.That is what really matters."
4,A Wonderful if not the most enlightened perspective,"Gary Zukav has much to give and share. Like so many other's that appear on the great Oprah show these writers become instant best sellers. It's a little sad that others with even more powerful messages of hope, healing are over looked. The Book SIGNALS here at amazon is a prime example. Here a is an important book over looked. I challenge you to go and look at SIGNALS."
3,"Good Premise, But Not Enough Depth","I reserved Gary Zukav's SOUL STORIES from my local library rather than purchase it because I thought it might prove to be ""more of the same"" of this popular genre. However, little did I know it would be THAT much more of the same! Mr. Zukav seems very sincere in his beliefs, and the brief length of his chapters and the parable-like format make for easy reading. Indeed, I liked his Hawaiian shaman's emergency blessing so much (for when it's hard to find the good in someone, just remember: ""His exhalation feeds the plants."") that I wrote it down. However, I found Mr. Zukav to be quite repetitive in his ideas; so much so that this book could have been half its present length. The content of SOUL STORIES seemed to be much more appropriate for the lecture circuit than for a book-signing."
2,Too patronizing and not enough substance,"I really wanted to like this book (and audio tapes) as I have enjoyed seeing the author on Oprah but he reads it to you as if you are a very young child incapable of getting the point - and he never really got to a point. A lot of cute, feel-good stories, a lot of repetition, and not much more, I'm afraid."
3,Seat of the Soul Fan Let Down,"I was let down by ""Soul Stories."" I loved Zukav's ""Seat of the Soul"" book and was pumped up to read his newest release. ""Soul Stories"" started out great and kept my attention for the first half of the book. I had to force myself to read the second half or it would have ended up under the bed and forgotten. Zukav has some wonderful concepts to relate and I wish more people would adopt his view of spiritual seeking, but some of his stories or analogies were lame. At times I felt like he was too simplistic and therefore came across as superior in the way he presented his outlook."
2,Great Content- But Haven't We Heard This Before?,"Some of the stories were interesting, and much of the content of this book was spiritually enlightening, touching on beliefs found in Eastern philosophies which was very much to my liking. However, the content of the book appeared very repetitious of Zukav's previous work, and left me wondering if I read it all before, but with a slight change of wording and a little different scenario.What did disappoint me about the book is the manner in which many of the sentences were structured - short and choppy. By the time the end of the book arrived, the style was down-right annoying and reminded me of my first primary reader in grade school. I am still pondering whether I was more spiritually uplifted by the content, or exasperatingly annoyed by the writing style."
3,A useful but not essential read,"I have mixed feelings about Soul Stories. This book is a series of thought provoking stories. You will not like all of them, at least I didn't, but on the whole the book was a good read.I believe Gary is sincere in his efforts improve the human condition and I believe he is one of many people making progress in this area. You are as well and this book may help you along that path.My only hesitation in this review is some of the stories seem to stretch Gary's sincerity or experience. I have a strong preference for guides to only talk from experience. I don't know if this impression is fair or perhaps it is only something in me.Check to see if your library has the book and see for yourself.This book was published in 2000. I found Soul to Soul published in 2007 to be a more mature read on the subject."
4,Gentle inspiration,"I listened to the cassette version of Soul Stories. It is narrated by the author, and I love his voice, and the way he reads. It's good to hear a book expressed the way the author intends it to be received. I highly respect Gary Zukav, and really enjoy him as a guest on Oprah, but I didn't feel I learned anything particularly new; rather I received a gentle inspiration to continue on the type of path that Zukav teaches about in his other books. His style is not preachy, and he basically advocates acceptance, forgiveness, and love for all humans, and encourages us to reach our fullest potential as spiritual beings. The stories are not especially unique, but all combined, it is the type of recorded book you could listen to many times for encouragement, and as a reminder about the purpose for our existence."
3,A reply to converts of Zukavism,"I'd say Gary Zukav is about 90 degrees off the mark. I didn't much care for Seat of the Soul. It wasn't grounded enough in the familiar to reach me where I am. Soul Stories is a little more readable, but more of the same philosophy.I can see how anyone left out in the cold by post-modern relativism would flock to Zukav. I filled my empty space long ago with the simple, ageless truths of my Christian faith. It's not about empowering ourselves, Mr. Zukav. Never has been. Our strength comes from realizing we are nothing without God and everything with Him.Debbie Thurman has probably said it best. Truth brings freedom and truth is immutable, never relative. I don't see any fear there. Most people won't get that."
5,More than words,"This book would be great even if I knew nothing about McManus' life and ministry. But, after hearing him speak and watching his work, this man literally ""practices what he preaches."" It is easy to challenge people to do something (which this book does wonderfully), but when the challenger lives out the challenge so boldly, it only makes it that much more powerful. Now, I need to go live it out too!"
5,rob,"To the reader who wrote this:""...anybody could be so gullible as to accept this gibberish! amazing...and to think ERWIN (who should find some time and do a little research first) is actually making money off you poor souls! oh, the pity. I give it a one, but only because it has print in it.""I would say....what is the fruit of your life in the kingdom? Erwin lives what he preaches, and lives are changed because of it. This book totally changed my focus from sitting back, waiting on God to ""find me"" to moving out and seeking where God is already at work, and joining in."
3,I struggled with certain aspects of this book,"What I love about the author's work is the attention to detail she gives to the historical aspects. I enjoy all the background she gives to the times she writes about. She crafts an interesting story in this book that has the reader totally engrossed and keen to find out what will happen next.What I don't like is the modern attitudes her characters often have towards sex. The h was an absolute innocent at the start of the story and suddenly in the space of a few days she is actually sexually forward towards the H. I don't believe this to be at all realistic in light of the times she lived in, she was Scottish (therefore even more sheltered than she would have been in the court of King Charles) or how a sheltered virgin would behave. It would have been more believable for her to have been seduced given the intimacy of the travelling arrangements they shared on the way to London."
2,Do Not Waste Money,"I have one of these, its now collecting dust.Why? Too big like a Gizmo.Do not be fooled by the picture, the optional LED does not come with it.Its just an overrated product."
3,Could've been better,"For the price of this case you won't get what you paid for.The front door is flimsy, the case doesn't come with power supply and the only good thing about it is the fact you can install ATX or mATX motherboard in it."
3,Words but no interpretation,"The subtitle states: ""All the words of Jesus in the New Testament arranged according to subjects."" The words of Jesus are from the RVS Bible (Revised Standard Version) c.1946, 1952.The 20 subject headings are: (1) Discipleship, (2) Eternal Life, (3) Evangelism, (4) Faith, (5) Forgiveness, (6) God, (7) Health--Healing, (8) Himself, (9) Holy Spirit, (10) Hypocrites, (11) Judgement (Hell, Punishment), (12) King of Heaven, (13) Love--Brotherhood, (14) Marriage--Divorce, (15) Money (Giving, Wealth), (16) Passion (Crucifixion), ( 17) Prayer, (18) Resurrection, (19) Sin and (20) Miscellaneous.Each subject heading is preceded by a short summary of what Jesus said about it. Interpretation is missing."
5,the best input device ever made,this is the most comfortable and easy to use not just trackball but input device ever made. The PS2 plug is no problem as any computer dealer will have a converter plug to USB. Why logitech doesn't reissue a USB version I'll never know...
5,This trackball hater loves this product,You have just got to try one. I cannot explain why I like this one so much and hate the others. The best I could do is probably 2 words. Functionality and ergonomics. It far exceeds all others in both departments.
5,Best Trackball ever invented!!,"I owned one of these back when they first came out. I paid 80 bucks for it, well 79.99 at staples. lol This was the best trackball device I have ever or probably ever know. The reason I believe this did so well for me was I can brace the ball with my thumb, NOT fingers. I move it with my fingers and brace it with my thumb so it has WAY more control of the ball then what you see today as trackballs. GOD do I miss this now. I never should have sold it long long ago, oh well Ill be buying one soon again. If your looking for an AWESOME trackball, THIS is the one for you!"
5,Get one of these and have a ball,"This is the best pointing device you can get. It might look like an alien, but it performs exceptionally well, even though it may have been designed for a right hand a bit smaller than mine.You really don't have to install the included MouseWare software if all you really need is two-button operation. From a practical standpoint, all the software really does is configure the 3rd and 4th buttons to do whatever you want them to do, such as double-click, drag-lock or any function you could imagine for a mouse button. It also adjusts orientation of the trackball, so you won't have to worry about its knowing which way you want to push the ball to make your arrow go straight up."
3,A bit slower than expected,"I got this laptop two weeks ago , since this laptop lacks a SATA drive (it's only using normal 5400RPM drive) it's performance is not very good , and the speakers quality is low ,no Bluetooth no firewire no infrared connectivity, I only ordered it for the price as this is the one of the lowest Centrino Duo Laptops on the web."
5,Love this book!,"I picked up a copy of Caramba! while stuck in a little suburb of St. Louis for an insurance class. Admittedly, I was desparate for a good read. First I was drawn to the cover of the book - vibrant and kitschy it practically jumped off the shelf at first glance.Then, opening the book to a random page, I was immediately hooked.This really is an exciting adventure with mysterious elements. The characters are vividly drawn and engaging.At first, I was a bit concerned with the Spanglish. I was afraid that I would lose interest because I would constantly have to stop to translate. Not so! The dialogue is very funny and won't stump the Spanish-challenged among us.Forget trading on E-Bay. This book has found a permanent home on my bookshelves."
4,Fun times,"Easy read. Has won awards. I thought it was a great chick book. The book cover is great, as are the other colorful touches that enhance the book pages. Magical realism meets Tom Robbins. It reminded me of ""Even Cowgirls get the Blues"", but not so radical and with artistic treats."
4,Ole!,"This is not the kind of book I generally read (chick lit) so I was a little uncertain. But what a fun surprise! The best way to describe this book is a zesty salsa. The main characters were colorful and, for the most part, likeable. The town and it's people were just different enough to be real. The writing bounced between English and Spanish so neatly, I almost felt bilingual. The ending was not completely satisfying, but oh well. I'm glad I read it."
4,"Spicy, saucy with some meat. Like a great mexican meal!","Ms. Martinez's book came at the right time for me. I was beyond busy with 2 stressful jobs, about to get on a plane in stormy weather and was needing a laugh badly. The book delivered with a story of love, mariachi, religion, drug dealing, transvestites and a little witchcraft thrown in. Martinez's book blends Mexican and American culture to render a story that ultimately examines what love is- the love of lifelong friends, the love of long-time admirers, the love of god, the love of being bad and the plain need to just be loved. It's not sentimental or mushy. Magic realism peeks in now and again, but doesn't overshadow. I give it 4 stars because it was a great book, but the end left me wanting a bit."
3,"Good instructor, but complicated choreography","This was my first Karen Voight DVD. She seems like a good instructor, but some of the choreography was too complex for me in this DVD. She moved into new moves really fast, and I found myself stopping to try to figure out what she was doing. Each time that I watched this DVD, I turned it off partway through and chose something else that I could follow and have fun with without getting frustrated. This DVD seemed like it was at an intermediate level, but it was hard to focus on making it intense enough for me when I was concentrating on simply getting the steps right. I really like doing half hour cardio segments, so the format of this DVD was great for me, but it's not one that I do very often."
4,Good bowling shoe,"The shoes are just a little lose on the sides, wish there were a little tighter. They are tight enough they don't fall off. Looked at other shoes in the bowling pro shop and these seem to be about the right price and I like the style of these shoes better than what the store had to offer. The shoes are comfortable."
3,bratz are cool but...................,NEVRA already has the same outfit that NAZALIA comes with.i dont like how bratz have the same clothes.
5,Unwind Your Child At Bedtime with This Book!,"A delightful ""sleepy-time"" book to be read over and over again to your child when it's bedtime! The reassurance your child will receive that The Sleepy Little Lion in this story is so adorably sleepy that NOTHING will keep him awake, is enough to relax children into bed and naptimes through repeated readings. This book is a genuine treasure for parents and children who will truly enjoy it's oversize, black and white, photographic detail and simple story. The book is charming, captures a child's imagination, and helps releive all the day's adventures. Like The Sleepy Little Lion, children are lulled into safe and loving comfort when they experience this book."
1,what a shocker...,"Fake KOBE! Fake girl. I was expecting a great Kobe story and it was all made up and it was practically a soft core porn, which is fine if you want to see a 30 year old Black guy with long ass nappy hair playing Kobe's fine ass and a blonde, bad actress playing the girl he f*cked. Not Recommended at all. I was very disappointed!!! I love KOBE! Long live the LAKER dynasty!"
3,They are ok,"I bought these strings hoping for a bluegrass feel but they really didn't as well as I expected. Don't get me wrong they are fine strings but I would just use the other SPs and not worry about the ""Bluegrass"" phoney bologna marketing hype."
2,Like playing cables,"These sounded like what I was looking for. Rich full bodied sound. That they have, as well as they are murder on my fingers and as stiff as board. I would not buy a second set."
5,A Must Have!,"I discovered this band at the Belly-up in Solana Beach, CA. They are fabulous performers and this is a wonderful collection. ""I'm Ready to Learn"" is one of the finest love songs I've ever heard! I wish Amazon carried this CD on a regular basis!"
3,Decent,"I'm not really a fan of dramatizations, even ones based on historical record. I prefer documentaries which present the facts clearly and which show historical sites. This dramatization was okay, it told an interesting story. I'm not sure how accurate all the facts are, but the film was short, sweet, and to the point.I only watched A Gladiator's Story though."
4,Very interesting,I bought this for a World Cultures class I teach in sixth grade. Instead of boring still pictures the dramatizations of the the last days of Pompeii kept the kids engaged and interested.
4,if your planning a visit,If you and your family are planning a visit to pompeii this is a wonderful backgroung infornational video. We purchased it after we got home and the kids wished we had seen it prior to the vaction
3,Underwhelmed,"While it was nice to see the story of Pompeii and the accompanying gladiator documentary, it wasn't all that entertaining. Very much like the documentaries that can be seen on the History Channel. It was a nice touch to have the actors speak in Latin, but overall it was a fairly simplistic production."
1,Can't be Viewed,"Was looking forward to watching this story, given the glowing reviews, unfortunately there was nothing in the description to indicate that it could not be viewed in Australia. One assumes that if you are selling to an international audience information that important would have been a courtesy, if not just plain honest.A waste of money!"
5,Fun Indoor Party,This is one of the funnest videos that you could buy!! A true indoor party(especially if you want to have the fun of a pub on St. Patricks Day without the crowds).This would be fun at a BYOB house party on this holiday!!!I watched on a sattelite station & HAD to have it!!!
3,"Boring, But Still MF","This CD was one of the series of 70's releases from Maynard Ferguson that was loaded with great solos by the Boss and little else.I recall thinking at the time how much the material on New Vintage sounded like the Conquistador release.Maria is interesting and MF does a superb job with it but it ends up going nowhere.Airegin is a great Mike Abene tune played very well.Scheherazade with disco beats? Please! Despite the upper register playing from MF, this tune does nothing for the overall presentation.If you're looking for a good MF CD to add to your collection, keep shopping.But if you buy it, you WILL enjoy MF's playing (and hopefully you will enjoy some 70's style arrangements, too)."
4,The album cover art says it all,"Like so many musicians growing up in the late 60s and early 70s, I was exposed to Maynard's music as his commercialism started to put him over the top. Some of his album cuts sound muddy and even become unlistenable because they are little more than a vehicle for his showmanship, and this album is no exception. The best cut on this album, in my opinion, is ""Maria."" He backs off on the showboating long enough to let the sweetness of the song shine through, and it makes you want to hit the repeat button. If you can't download the MP3, then buy the CD if only for this one track. It's worth it."
2,"I know this is a classic, but not for very young (6 month old) baby.",It talks about things my granddaughter cannot yet do and is not as good as other books for babies. I do not recommend it for a 6 month old.
3,Good graham crackers for my kids,"I like that these are organic and don't have corn syrup. My kids and I both like them. I'd give them 5 stars but I noticed earlier this year that they changed the recipe. The crackers are lighter and flakier than they used to be and they break more easily. And if you have kids under 5, you might understand how upsetting broken crackers can be. The taste is still great, but I preffered the old texture myself and definitely for my kids who cry when the crackers break while they are eating them. And when you order these in the mail, like I did last time, don't expect many full graham cracker sheets - most are already broken in two, and quite a few are broken at the edges as well."
5,Excellent product,"My children will only eat healthy products, and they love these graham crackers. I am so glad that they are available through Amazon!"
3,Expires too soon,"These crackers are terrific, and they are priced right. However, i ordered them on 10/29/06, and the expiration date on the box was 12/31/06. We have only eaten four boxes. They still taste fine after the expiration date, but... am i really expected to consume 12 boxes in 2 months?"
2,Too much and too little.,"This was the book used by my college Greek course (back in 1985). The general consensus among my classmates at the time was that this book was too complicated for beginners (especially those who weren't of Greek orgin), and too simple for those who were considered intermediate students.Those who never spoke Greek would have fared better if there was some mention of the relationship of Greek-rooted American words to make the vocabulary a little more digestible.For someone like me, who grew up in a Greek household (but never attended Greek school or formally educated in the Greek language), the book was a bore. And, I my command of the language was the same coming out as it was going in.I have given the book (yes I still have it) to my brother-in-law, who has a degree in Linguistics and is fluent in several languages. He can't seem to use it either. Perhaps this book should have been taught on a junior-high level."
2,Beware of Sizing!,"The overall quality of the filter is average to maybe a little above for a MERV 8. The real issue is the actual size of each filter. As stated by the manufacturer's specs, these filters are made or cut smaller than the normal size for each category. This is a real problem for many furnaces that take fitted filters in a bracket or tray. Without shimming around the sides of the filter, the air flows around - not through the filter. Air is like water and will take the path of least resistance. Unless you are sure an undersize filter will work in your furnace, do not buy this brand. It's kind of like orange juice and ice cream, maybe no one will notice if we reduce the size and charge the same price. I made the wood shim to seal the sides until I use up my supply but will go back to paying the higher price of the 3M next time."
4,Great Item,I bought this vacuum for my boyfriend and he loves it. He brags about how easily this vacuum manuevers around and how it picks up everything without hassle. Very impressive
5,We've had a great many years together!,"I found my Hoover Foldaway by way of a clearance aisle in a box store. I have never regretted the purchase. It has worked wonderfully through 5 years of apartment living and cleaning a 2400sq ft house for another 3+ so far. I've even (unfortunately) used it to clean up home improvement projects. I keep a couple filters onhand to switch out and, believe me, those filters last a long time with careful cleaning.After almost 9 years the filter release button inside the unit is cracking making it more messy when it falls apart on me while emptying the canister. Even so, it's still running and I give 5 stars for the life and service this simple vacuum has given me."
2,"Good, for a couple of years","I really liked this vacuum but after a couple of years it quit sucking up much of anything. It still runs and I have checked the brushes and gasket seals etc., but I can't figure out why it won't suck up even the smallest items. I guess vacuums aren't made to last anymore."
2,Save on bags spend on filters,"Of our four vacuums (Hoover widepath fold away, 2 Hoover wind tunnels and a Bissell bagless lift-off) we've relegated to this one to the basement - literally and figuratively. The bagless fold away seemed like a great idea but the poorly designed airflow & dust container mean the time and money you save on bags doesn't cover the extra headache of frequently replacing expensive filters. The refuse accumulates first around the filter at the top of the waste container instead of falling to the bottom like our Bissell lift off - or the steeply priced Dyson.We wouldn't buy it again."
2,Vacuum with little voom,Not a fan of this vacuum as it has little voom/suction abilities and I personally find the bagless functionality more cumbersome than the old fashion bag vacuums
3,"Great suction, but LOUD!!!!!!","This sweeper does a great job of getting the dirt and cleaning up, but it is LOUD!!! cap that slides up over the hose leading from the tumbler to the dust container rattles like crazy and becomes even louder if you use the vacuum attachments as there is nothing keeping it shut tight. I would think twice about getting it again just for that.. it is a nuisance."
3,Seems OK,"I bought this product to put more of a shine on briar pipes that I have made. I waxed them with carnauba, but want a higher gloss. So, I was experimenting with various products. Using this product seemed to actually dull the finish on the briar. But, it did seem to do a nice job on the plastic pipe tips. So, it was not a total loss."
2,Condition: New??,"I am not sure if this book was new or used when it was shipped. For one, it was shipped in a large box with a fan and the movement in that package may have left the paperback looking used. But, the binding appears to be creased which would indicate that the book was not new. The front cover will not lay flat against the pages of the book. The book had several pages bent at the top and the book had spaces in the pages looking as if the book had been read previously and then resold.Murder On Monday (Lois Meade Mystery)I have the rest of this collection of books and all of them were purchased new and look new.The product I ordered cost $6.59 and the condition was new and sold by GrammiesAttic."
1,WHAT'S ALL THE EXCITEMENT ABOUT?!?,"After reading all the rave reviews for ""Murder on Monday"" I thought I was going to read something comparable to an Agatha Christie mystery. This is the first novel of Ann Purser's I've read and I was sorely disappointed. I don't know what everybody is raving about. There was hardly any ""investigating"" done as a ways and means to discover who the murderer was and all of a sudden, it all comes together, as a huge surprise, in the last few pages of the book. If I get desperate for an ""English cozy"" I might try one of Purser's ""Round Ringford"" books, or a different author."
3,Murder on Monday,"A small village, a murder of a spinster and for what you may ask? The same question is falling on the tongues of all that live in this small peaceful place or at least it was small and peaceful until the unthinkable happened. Was it the neighbor or the house keeper? no one has the answer until she takes the job of finding out, who is she? a wife and mother with the need to know herself and her name is Lois Meade and she is the house cleaner. She not only cleans houses but knows a lot about the dirt behind the front door of many homes. She will find her self finding out more than she thought she knew about the personal lives of the towns people,secrets that no one was suppose to no. A must read- Larry Hobson-Author-""The Day Of The Rose'"
1,"""Week"" Debut","In order to help her family's finances, Lois Meade has begun taking on house cleaning jobs in the nearby village of Long Farnden. It's a seemingly nice place, and while a couple of her clients can be hard to handle, she enjoys it.Then on a Monday night, Gloria Hathaway is murdered. Gloria was a spinster who seemed to be liked by her neighbors. The police quickly ask Lois to keep her ears open since it seems all her clients had connections to Gloria. Can she find the killer?More importantly, will anyone care? While I liked Lois despite her uneven temperament, I was bored out of my mind by the plot. It went nowhere and did it slowly. The pits of plot were easy to spot early on. And just when I thought the book would begin to pick up, it then went back to slogging along.I won't be reading any more of this series, and I advise you to look elsewhere for your cozy fix."
4,An English village cozy,"This book epitomizes the English village who-dun-it, brought up-to-date. To be sure, there is the thatched cottage, the vicar, the doctor and the district nurse plus a cast of other worthy individuals. But this village has a cleaning lady with attitude and a certain lack of respect for worthiness.The writer is no stranger to writing books about life in an English village, and this experience with the setting and the characters stands her in good stead here. Unlike other writers who only dream their English village, this one actually knows what they, and their inhabitants, are like.The plot is sound, the pacing is good and the dialogue is first rate - one of the best features of the book. It was a fun read - I look forward to reading more mysteries by this writer - and finding out what happened between the cleaning lady and that dishy policeman."
3,I really wanted to like this book...,"One of the other reviewers said it was difficult to connect with the main character. I agree with that. But I liked the mystery, and I loved the author's descriptions of small English village life.And because of the things I liked about it, I will probably read her next book to see if I like Lois better in the Tuesday story.I just wish that I could have liked Lois and her family more. That's why I only gave it three stars."
1,Don't Buy This Joystick,"I have already exchanged this joystick twice. It doesn't work with standard Windows 98 drivers, and it doesn't come with any software. Visit DriverGuide message boards for more unhappy customers."
3,where is the software,"I have used this joystick on fls98...no problem i just wish it had a rutter contol...well you get what u pay for..i since gave it to a buddy who cant not get this thing to work..it just locks up when he uses it with fls98, his system crashes it a mess....I have up graded to microsoft percision pro 2......wow what a joystick...work outstanding with all games.....................hope this was helpful"
1,Lemon,"It doesn't work at all. I assume I have gotten a lemon, according to the reviews, at least one of these things works."
1,it will not calibrate. have not been able to use w/games,Not happy with product. cannot calibrate properly. will not adjust-unable to play games since day one. No control- no fun- disappointing.
1,Don't Buy This Joystick,"I bought this Joystick thinkin that it would work for my computer, and It wouldn't I wasnt't even compatible with my computer. Don't Waste your money, because it may not work for your computer either"
4,"Interesting, but flawed","Interesting stuff here, fascinating too. But Walden could have done better with a good editor. Way too much repetition here, and bad sentences."
1,painfully obvious,"I found this novel nothing short of dreadful. Despite exotic trappings and labored arcane rigamarole, the characters are cardboard creations pushed through a plot that is totally transparent from square one. Even in his better efforts Zimler's style tends to cloy because of his evident belief that his work is deeply meaningful and must therefore be difficult to grasp, and as a result he constantly makes the obvious even more painfully so with authorial nudges in the ribs. He has hit rock bottom here."
2,Short visit to another planet,"The characters of the Angelic Darkness caught my eye when I was actually looking for the Last Kabbalist of Lisbon, absent from my book store. I was looking for stories about Sephardic Jews and it was recommended to me. The Angelic Darkness had a continuous thread. I thought for awhile that the characters in Bill's book about the Inquisition would reappear as promised. The ending gave me the impression that Zimler stopped writing his book and started telling about his love affair. They were only scantily connected. At first, I thought this was a weird, spiritual, loose kind of book. Then, at the end, I thought it was just a weak story by a good writer who wasn't writing well at the time. Proves anyone can get a book published."
5,A lightly-used book in good condition- as advertised.,"I live in the Chesapeake Bay area where blue crabs are held in high regard as maybe the best crab there is. This recipe book has a lot of classic, authentic and recipes, many if not most of which come from the people that live on the Bay and have been passed down for generations.This was advertised as a lightly-used book in good condition and that's exactly what I received. It arrived well-packaged and within a week of ordering. I would definitely order from this vendor in the future."
5,Great book for little girls in particular,Love this book because it is interactive between the child and reader. Was one of my girls favorites.
2,Terrible film overall.,"Normally I ignore bad movies and do not review them unless thay offend me. COMMANDOS offended me. It is poorly shot, poorly directed and the ""Germans"" all speak perfect English. This movie has a few decent action scenes, but overall it is just a B- movie about some WW2 commandos in Africa. I watch a lot of WW2 films and this one has to be the cheapest I have ever seen. Waste of time...even for 3.00"
3,works great but...,plenty of good reviews here so I will not go into details on the product itself... the only bad side of this product is that once it does its job its garbage... I have now switched to Panamax products for the one reason that they are usable AFTER the product does its job and save all your equipment and if for some reason it does burn out they have a LIFETIME guaranty... so in my humble opinion they are worth the extra cost... and they are made in U.S.A... got to love that!!!
5,monster power,The monster power cleaner has made my lcd tv have a better picture my stereo sound better.reassures me my equipment is safe in storms & power outages it is a must have item.
4,It's great!,"The 3500 came recommended to me by my neighbor who has two in his house. Not only does it have a great look, but offers the piece of mind that my assets are now protected."
4,HTS 3500 MK II Review,"I bought this piece for surge protection purposes, with hopes that it may improve my already very good audio/video. I did not have any problems with my audio/video set up. After adding the Monster Cable product, I must say, I have not noticed any performance enhancement whatsoever. There is solice in knowing that the equipment is protected. Read the latest Sound and Vision article on power line cleaners. There is the ""law of diminishing returns"". Don't spend more than you need for your specific setup."
3,A decent unit,"This is a decent line conditioner. It filters out a lot of noise from my power, including all of my appliances. The one thing it can't seem to filter out completely, however, is the Dimmers on the torchier lamps. I can always hear when one of those darn things is on. Otherwise its a decent unit."
3,Great product...if you can find it cheap,"However, I give only 3 stars for value. For what this unit does, it should cost $175 at the most. I have one (which I found new for $169) and use it as a power center for powering up my home theater in sequence. It has a 12 volt tigger that works well with the tigger output from my Outlaw Audio pre/pro. It does a nominal job at ""cleaning up"" the power - the power stages of your components (unless they were made before 1950) should do more than an adequate job of ""cleaning the signal"" so that should never be the selling point of one of these units."
2,Monster does not support DIRECTV High Def,"I bought this device because I needed a surge protector. I could have bought a cheap $50 surge protector but considering the cost of this device $160 this was a bargain. I wanted to protect a new Samsung DLP, home theater and new h20 directv hdr. Its a solid metal piece, the volt meter and indigo glow is a discussion piece. I noticed the fluctuation in my house voltage from 115 to 120.Why a 2, well to my surprise one of the satellites do not register in the directv. Only when I disconnect the satellite coax from the monster device and plug it directly into the directv h20 dvr did it register. I would imagine all the Monster devices have the same problem no matter the cost since the enginneering would be similar.Really too bad considering monster's reputation, would have been better off buying a cheaper device.h"
5,J.SMART. DETROIT,"I AM DELIGHTED TO READ A GREAT NOVEL THAT I AM FAMILIAR WITH SOME OF DETROIT'S HOT SPOT, LIKE THE COMFORT ZONE. I ENJOYED READING THIS NOVEL SO MUCH IT WAS HARD TO PUT IT DOWN... I AM LOOKING FORWARD TO YOUR NEXT NOVEL."
5,An Advent Must,"Good reading from a variety of excellent, trusted writers...Nouwen, Bonhoeffer, Manning, etc. all offer reflections on the Advent/Christmas season that will make you go deeper...Personally, I struggle with reading during this time of year due to busy schedule but I have found this daily digest a perfect way to enhance my Advent season of waiting..."
5,Fantastic,I am half through this book and it is revolutionizing the Advent season. The writers have spent so much time in scripture and prayer that they see Christmas as the properly huge event that is was and is.
1,Amazingly UN-inspiring,"With names like C.S. Lewis, Philip Yancey, Madeleine L'Engle and Dietrich Bonhoeffer on the cover, I expected, at the least, that the book would be orthodox. It didn't take long, though, to realize that most of the writers were extremely liberal in their theology.William Stringfellow wrote of the ""political character of Advent"" while John Howard Yoder wrote of Mary's Magnificat as ""a revolutionary battle cry."" Furthermore, the people walking in darkness (Isaiah 9:2) are not walking in the darkness of sin, according to Jürgen Moltmann, but are crying out for their human rights. Dorothee Soelle wrote that the sick people in the Gospel of Luke had been made sick by political oppression and economic plunder. Sadly, the book manages to squeeze sin and salvation into the very narrow molds of poverty and justice.While I enjoyed the entries by John Donne, Brennan Manning and C.S. Lewis, the other chapters were too militant to be encouraging or inspiring."
4,Amazing book!,"The devotions in this book are truly amazing. Thanks for a great product, and for getting it to me so quickly!"
2,Chess set review,The craftsmanship and quality of the chessmen for plastic pieces is probably unsurpassed excluding the fact that one of the pieces upon delivery was fraid on the felt bottom which I will eventually have to reglue with matching colored felt when it becomes unplayable. If not for that I would have given it a 5 plus rating. The roll up felt board is of excellent quality.
1,Not Actually AC/DC,"Do not buy this album if you think it is a rare AC/DC single to add to your collection. It took about a month to arrive and when it did I played it and it wasn't what I thought it was. It is some techno junk music, not rare AC/DC."
1,misandry don't real,"I do not think you understand. Misandry don't real, what the author is actually speaking about is trying to reclaim lost privileges. Cry more."
1,Victim Misogyny,"It is true that the rigid gender roles that prevent communication between the sexes create problems for men. However, this is a manifestation of misogyny, not ""misandry."" Dogma in gender roles is exactly what feminism was created to work against. The right can throw around millions of dollars in grants so think tanks and individuals can write books like this or put forth endless untrue criticisms of feminism on Fox News, but there will always be people who just don't think it's right for women to make 76 cents for every dollar a man makes. They can't stop that by insisting that men are somehow under attack."
4,Nice Faucet,"Faucet was what I expected. Excellent quality and nice modern look. It was a simple install .... once I got out the old one! Only reason I didn't give it five stars is price. This is a lot of $$ for a faucet and while it's better than the $200 faucet's out there, it's not 2-3 X's as good."
5,St. John's Gospel: A Bible Study Guide and Commentary for Individuals and Groups,Very thorough and meaningful study guide. This is not for someone wanting a quick walk through the Gospel of St. John. Extensive use of the catechism and references to numerous Old Testament and New Testament texts brings the Gospel into focus.
4,Excellent resource for catholics,I would give it five stars plus if the text from John was included. It is a bit cumbersome to read while on the road or away from home as you can't reference the scripture without having a bible to look at. Even then with a bible it is frustrating.
1,Broke on the first charge,I give up. I bought this b/c the drill is discontinued and I needed to charge my batteries. It broke on the first charge. I've thrown away the drill and bought a new one.
1,"Black and Decker 15,6 Volt Battery charger","This unit only lasted a week. It, like the one I had originally replaced, burned out after only two or three battery charges. I was extremely disappointed. I may end up buying a product from another manufacturer as without a reliable charger, battery-powered tools are useless. Black and Decker....what happened to your normal excellent quality when you made this item?"
3,Check battery before inserting,It is a defective battery that is probably damaging the charger.Take the battery some place (Like Batteries Plus)and make sureit is not defective before attempting to charge.
3,LOL Funny!,"Southerners, laugh at yourselves! You know it's true. For those who believe ""There's no such thing as overdecorating,"" you can pick up a few good ideas from this book. A genuine southerner would find at least one new idea worth trying. From gift suggestions, to re-gifting guides to a calendar plan for Christmas, there's something here for everybody. All it needs is a good grits recipe and a picture of the lady in Tallahassee who decorated herself with Christmas lights while decorating her yard. Now, please excuse me while I re-wrap this book as a gift for a friend!"
3,"Super cute outside, lacking a bit inside","It is cute and there are quite a few funny parts. This book is titled so well that my expectations were really high; I expected the contents to be more entertaining. It took about two hours for me to read the whole thing, and it is a good book. It is also a great conversation piece when you have company."
2,Not The Best,Not exactly what I thought it would be. In fact I deem this one a rip off. Just a bunch of memories that the author hoped would be funny but fell flat. Don't bother or waste your money
1,This book is a waste of time and money.,"I grew up in the South and have lived in various parts of the South and this book does not capture ""Christmas in the South."" This book is a series of observations of 50 words or less, most of which lack any humor whatsoever. While the South does have it's traditions and unusual ways of doing things the book goes in an entirely different direction. Most of the writing is banal and boring with little anticipation about what is coming next. Do yourself a favor - spend your money and time somewhere else."
1,Nobody's Guide,"This book is tacky, demeaning and downright offensive! I have just as much a sense of humor as any of my fellow Southerners but this goes beyond mere comedy. Most of the content is so negative it is unbelievable. I truly question Mr. Barnette's origins and/or loyalty. I hesitate to try any of his other work."
2,Amusing,"It was what I would call a quickread. Not a lot of substance to it. Witty, plotless (which might be ok for. some) , a nice diversion from the darkness of our world."
1,Book totally missed the mark,"I did not find this book to be entertaining or funny. Some people who read it said that it was insulting to people who live in the south but I wasn't insulted at all - merely bored and sorry I spent $3 for it. Part of the problem with the book may be that writers and comedians have already pretty much worn out all the old cliches about Southerners, so that if one isn't able to at least perk it up with some new perspective or observations, it's going to fall flat, like this book does. The cover is pretty and the name is sort of catchy, so I do have something positive to say about the book."
2,Alot of money for little use,"This would be a great machine for a massive amount of food to be frozen, but then you may not be able to afford the bag rolls. It does work well, but is not practical for freezing something for only a month or two. You can buy ALOT of freezer bags for this price."
1,Chintzy,"They look as though there is some semblance of rigidity in the photos, but alas... none. The yoke being without adjustment means they have to be taken to a tailor to adjust the length for your bike.I thought these would be a good fit for my vintage British bike. Leather has too much of a Harley feel and I thought these were more working class cool. They now sit at the bottom of a closet with other useless purchases.Pass a dena."
3,The entire 58 minute ballet on only ONE track??,"I don't know why the other reviews did not mention that this whole hour-long work has no track divisions, which surely affects the value of this CD. If it were one of only a few great recordings it could be overlooked. I think it significantly reduces the value of this otherwise fine offering. The original CD release of Dutoit's performance had the same problem, but this was corrected with the remastered release."
3,very bad copy,my kids liked watching it and didn't seem to care about the bad color and sound. Not very well made!
1,First time ever not impressed with quality,I have been an avid Movie collector for quite some years now. This is the first time I was not impressed with the quality of the product. I found the sound to be muffled and picture quality was absolutely terrible. It was watchable but not with surround sound had to watch movie and use the tv speakers on low so we could hear what they were saying. I would not recommend buying this movie even though it is one of the rescue episodes for Gilligans Island. Look for a digitally restored version if you can.
3,Rescue From Gilligan's Island,"This is a fun story that follows the castaways after their return to ""civilization."" The story proves that sometimes one really can't go home."
1,Disappointing,"I used to love Gilligan's Island, and I have enjoyed introducing my kids to the old shows, so innocent. I have bought the seasons shows on DVD and I would definantly recommend that, but the movie... that is a different story. I was a little disappointed by the story line, but more than that was the ""B"" quality of the movie and the shocking acting!"
5,Excellent and well supported,This is an excellent and well supported book. I enjoyed reading it and am thankful that Masalha has collected all the facts on the matter. Those who are open to the truth cannot but be moved by the sheer injustice that has accompanied the whole Zionist project and the creation of the state of Israel.
1,Apparent ... Seems To Sell These Days!,"It seems to me that his book is mostly 'lifted' from Dr. Chaim Simons earlier (1988) well researched book available at Amazon, ""International Proposals to Transfer the Arabs of Palestine: 1895-1947, A Historical Survey"". What Nur Masalha ignores in his 'edited version' of Dr. Simons' work is that the earliest proposals to transfer the Arabs out of what became Israel were proposed by non-Jews first, not by the Zionists. Several major prominent international figures, former US president Herbert Hoover for example, supported the TRANSFER IDEA. Take a good look at Dr. Simons' book, you'll discover just how popular TRANSFERING ARABS OUT OF ISRAEL really was among world leaders in that period. And I might add, if it had taken place and the Arabs would have been comfortably settled elseware, non of the violence, warfare, and bloodshed would have occured for the last 50+ years. THE TRUTH MUST BE TOLD!"
1,Boring book on an obvious point,There are much better books on the Palestinian diaspora out there - I suggest that you look around. This book was rather boring and a little opinionated.
5,The Resilient Enterprise: A MUST read for all,"Yossi Sheffi has compiled a masterful accounting of the challenges businesses face every day. His depictions of events are real-life, his advice on preventing and recovering from major disruptions is sound and he presents this all in an extremely readable fashion. This book is a must read for everyone in business, especially those who do not understand the value added proposition that corporate security teams add to the bottom line."
5,Best book for climbing in Maryland... PERIOD.,This guy has done some serious research! I am amazed at the many uncovered gems that I found in this tome. He has obviously spent countless hours all over Maryland seeking out even the most unreachable of climbing areas. I would highly recommend this book to anyone who climbs between the Potomac and Susquehanna!
4,Jay'z Jazz,"Spyro Gyra frontman and sax ace, Jay Beckenstein comes up with a winner in Eye Contact. This collection has some very cool tracks; Northline, Eye Contact, Monsoon (really nice), and a sweet rendition of Goodbye Porkpie Hat. A noticeably looser, less kinetic sound from the head Spyro Gyrian, but the relaxed pace isn't a handicap. This cd would benefit from a few more melodic hooks and the kid's chorus in Lookin' Up is a distraction, but Eye Contact will undoubtedly make the drive home cooler and easier."
4,"""I contact"" you about Jay's new disk","When I heard that Jay Beckenstein was going to release a solo project, I really didn't know what to expect. I had read somewhere that he didn't want it to sound like a Spyro Gyra record. And it doesn't. Jay journeys beyond the realm of Spyro and in doing so, recruits a host of guest musicians, many of them guitarists and bassists. Hear guitar wizard Chieli Minucci on ""Sunrise"" (a typical Minucci-sounding track), look for Chuck Loeb's solo in ""Monsoon"" (he's on a couple of other tracks besides), and Spyro's own Julio Fernandez gives a brief solo to ""Turnaround"", which I feel is the best track. This one and the previous track, ""Black Market"" have an African flavour, and compliment each other well. Also enjoyable are the upbeat ""Northline"" and ""West Side Cool"". The skip button comes in handy for me on the slow ""Heart & Mind""; however you may enjoy it. But nevertheless, a great effort and if you are a big fan of Spyro Gyra, you have to have this one as well."
2,Two stars went to the profession of Mr.Beckenstein,"I've been listening spyro gyra for a long time,and I always enjoyed to listen the soprano sax of Jay Beckenstein.I bought an""Eye Contact"" from England.I paid lots of money to this album.It includes 11 songs but some of the songs seems like completed in hurry.Yes there is a masterful effort of the musicians but I wish It was spyro gyra's the three wishes album.I will not suggest this album to anyone who hopes nice moody music pieces,it seems like a compilation of various sax players.I should buy peter gabriel instead of this."
3,will not last forever,"im in the market for a new trackball. ive used aLogitech Marble Mouse Trackball for about 3 years. one of the buttons has become weak and falters. i hold it down, dragging the things onscreen, and the button flickers off, dropping what im dragging. is the life of a mouse 3 years? can't we shoot for 10?"
3,"Good, solid trackball","This Logitech trackball is pretty good--durable, sensitive, with sensible button placement. That said, its ergonomic design isn't for everyone; my large, stubby hand and fingers aren't ever quite at rest with it. (Could it be that that's the secret of ergonomy?) I hated it at first, but have grown used to keeping my wrist muscles slightly tensed. As a writer, I don't use the pointer nearly as much as the keyboard, but I imagine that a designer or other GUI-intensive professional might find this problematic. For less-frequent users, or those lucky enough to possess properly-shaped hands, this is plenty good enough."
5,Great natural cream-filled cookies!,"New Morning Graham-Wiches, Honey Graham & Vanilla Creme Sandwich Cookies are an excellent natural alternative to additive/preservative loaded cookies on the market. The flavor is excellent, and kids love them! They do have a tendency to crumble some, but they still taste great & I'd recommend them to anyone looking for natural snack alternatives for their kids, while trying to get away from artifical flavors, colorings & preservatives."
2,Broke within 5 minutes...,The guitar broke within the first 5 minutes my son played with it & he was just strumming it. The bar that holds the strings on the bottom ripped right off and could not be repaired.
2,Just for Looks,"If you're interested in getting this as a novelty gift, it's cute but fragile. Don't expect to be able to tune this thing to anything relative to standard tuning, because either the low strings will be too loose or the high strings will be too tight--and, as another reviewer pointed out, snap the bridge right off the body!In my opinion, a toy guitar with real strings, nut, bridge, tuners, etc. that can't play even a semblance of a tune is no more useful than a plastic toy guitar. If you're into it for the small-scale authenticity of a steel-string guitar, this makes for a cute toy, but it's ultimately unplayable. If you're looking for something more durable or able to keep a tune, keep shopping."
1,Very Poor Quality,"Incredibly poor quailty. I would not puchase. My two year old fell in love with this guitar, but unfortunately it doesn't seem that it will outlast his interest. After a 1/2 hour of play the bar that holds down the strings started pulling out of the body. Amazon very nicely sent a replacement, so I could swap out guitars. The replacement one has one peg that will not stay turned for even 2 seconds (all the pegs come loose but at least the others stay turned for a little while). So my child is playing a five string. For the price I wasn't expecting anything other than a toy, but it should be a least ""playable."""
1,cowboy guitar,"did not work at all, my daughter did not even hit one string, i need my money back, strings came loose at every try"
1,Not what I expected,"My husband plays guitar so we purchased this for my 3 year old daughter. While this guitar is very cute, it isn't even suitable for a child to pretend to ""play"". I was at least expecting it to make noise resembling a guitar when you strum it but it is so cheaply made. The strings came unwound by themselves and fell off; my daughter ""played"" with it about 5 minutes."
4,Cheap fun.,"My son loves this guitar and ever since he got his first one on his second birthday about 18 months ago. He plays it all the time and it's probably his favorite possession. It's definitely not very durable. I've had to glue the thing back together 4 or 5 times now, and I eventually had to buy him a new one. (He'll only play this model and he can identify it by the design.) That said, I think I paid about $22 and got free shipping. Given how much use he gets out it, it's still a great deal. Just be sure to buy a tube of wood glue with it! One other note - I've seen a few reviews commenting on the musical quality of this and other toddler guitars. That doesn't weigh into my analysis at all. My son just likes strumming along with the Wiggles and other kids' music. I'll worry about sound in a few more years when it matters."
5,The ONE to Have!,"If you can only have one book on Luftwaffe aircraft in World War II, this is the one to have. I've been dragging my copy around since 1973 when I bought it for $25.00 + .95 for the plastic cover."
3,The way we get by,The video is an informative film of how a group of elderly individuals devote their time to supporting troops serving our country by sending them of with well wishes and greeting others upon their return with high praise
1,Not Closed Captioned,"I could only watch a minute of the dvd, borrowed from our local library. Neither I (age 78)nor my wife (74) could continue to comfortably watch it, unfortunately, for the subject reason. Kind of an irrational production for us old-timers, especially since the ""stars"" were old folks! The rating is only applicable for caption-impaired folks, none other."
1,Poor Graphics Render this Product Unusable,"We are very disappointed with this product. It has flashy looks that will draw in a child and also lure in parents hoping to wrest their own computer screen back from their young child. Unfortunately, that is as far as this product goes. The image quality is so poor that you can not see what is going on. All of the games are visually cued, so the cheap unreadable graphics render this product unusable. You are better off sharing your own computer with your child and spending money on age appropriate educational games. Or, you can get sucked into a shameless cash grab by the folks at vtech."
1,If we could only see the screen...,What a great product this would be if only we could see the screen. My 5 year old and I are constantly leaning forward and trying to see and interpret the grahics. Why this company would put so much into designing great learning games but not creating a screen we can see is beyond me.
3,Small screen and terrible graphics,"My son got it for his 4th birthday. I agree with the other reviews. The toy looks great, looks almost like a real computer but once you open it, the screen is too small and hard to read. It comes with 8 cartridges that you insert into the game slot and my 4 year old found it hard to get it out of the slot each time. Opening up the laptop is also a little difficult for tiny hands. All in all it has great potential and looks really cool but the screen size sucks.Updated Nov 19 2009:Although I gave this a bad review initially, my son does not seem to notice the screen size and absolutely loves this toy! Even my 7 year old loves playing with it. So I am increasing the rating as the kids seem to enjoy the toy."
2,Graphics are horrible!,I have to agree with the reviewer that said graphics are horrible - the toy looks like it has a lot of potential for both learning and fun -- but if you can't see the screen (both too small and unclear graphics) you can't have fun or learn!
1,Not worth purchasing,"I purchased this for my 5 year old for Christmas. He loves the fact that it has a mouse and a case to carry it in, and it opens just like a real laptop. The problem is that the graphics are so bad that you can only see the screen in a particular light. I really wanted to keep this (I'm taking it back) because it is a learning tool, I just think if you can't see the screen, it's pretty hard to use. We also have the Leapster Learning game system and with the Leapster the Graphics are awesome. If looking for a learning tool and durablility I would go with the Leapster."
1,Garbage,"My kids were given these as Christmas gifts. My 4 1/2 year old was really excited. But, the games and graphics and display, and sounds and everything else are so lame that it doesn't hold his interest. At 4 1/2, he was able to max out the ""learning"" programs and as he progressed through the levels, they didn't get much harder. The games are worthless. This leaves my husband and I thinking that maybe we just stick with the fun hands-on toys, like trucks and trains for toy time and maybe invest in a Wii...at least we'd know he was having fun. This toy is no fun and it's straining on the eyes. I can't believe they market this as an educational toy. TOTALLY not worth ANY cash...the designers should be fired."
2,its not worth it,I bought this toy for my 5 year old for christmas. The graphics are terrible you cannot see the screen clearly to even play any of the games. Its a waste of money. The graphics is the only complaint i have. If you cant see the screen clearly you cannot play the game!!
2,Not what we expected,"This table comes in two pieces. That in itself is a problem, because it is not secure, even as a tabletoop conversion. Just bumping into it, can move it out of place. It isalso very difficult to move because of the sheer weight of it. It certainly was not what we expected. We had to return it, and consequently eat the cost of shipping. It also did not come with the net and paddles that were a part of the package."
2,Missing parts,"The product description for this says ""Includes a net set, two hard rubber rackets, and three balls"". However, none of that was received. Just two big pieces of wood, that's all it is. No instructions or documentation of any kind."
4,looks like Will Wyatt nailed it,Fascinating read. Will hold you spellbound until the very end.Now if I could only get my hands on the doc based on this book. I know there was one made by the BBC some years back...only it is not easy to track down.
5,Magnificient Mina,"Great singer, one of the best in the world. To her all is possible and this CD is the perfect demonstration. I found it incredible, spiritual, with a lot of feeling from Mina's interpretations.I suggest to buy her CD title ""NAPOLI"" to have a similar strong effect but with napolitan songs revisited in jazz mood, and the other CD title ""MINA GOLD"" to have an overview on her legendary career and features."
3,Decent vampire flick. Very poor film quality.,"This is a decent 1970s vampire flick inported from Europe. Mark Damon plays twin brothers whoinvestigate Count Dracula's castle. They meet Dracula's widow played by Sara Bay. Much nudityand bloody murder follow. This film is a cheaper, harder version of the popular Hammer studiofilms from the same period. I give the film high points for the decent storyline and the fact that SaraBay is such a beautiful woman. Low points are very cheesy special effects and a terribletransfer to DVD. This film looks like a sixth generation VHS tape recording. All in all, notbad for the $1.99 VOD rental price."
5,Wow.....,All I can say is WOW! I was very pleasantly surprised by how powerful this little baby is! Definitely a must have for anyone who likes to spice it up or just get a little playful!
5,A lot of buzz for your buck,"Great product! Lots of power for such a little vibe. If you're looking for a good little vibe, try this one. Small and discreet, quiet, long enough cord to move around comfortably. I have purchased hundreds of dollars in ""toys"" and this one has the best bang for your buck."
1,Very weak,"This had no strength at all. If you need power to get any pleasure, dont waste your time with this, its the weakest thing ive found so far..was very disappointed after waiting for it in the mail. They should discontinue these."
5,Amazing!!!,"This has been the first toy I have ever purchased for myself, and lets just say I am very happy with my experience and look forward to trying new toys in the future. This little guy does just the trick and has a very nice pulse to it that is strong enough to do the job. I had tried a competitors brand and the vibration was not near as intense as this ones is. It is really fun to spice the bed room up with to! My fiance and I are loving it!"
5,great,i bought two of these figuring theyd wear out so fast id need a quick replacment. i am still owrking on the first one i bought this months ago. i love this i have trouble having an orgasam without clitorial stimulation so me and my husband bought these to help. they are awesome i love them. thanks
2,Best to get this for $1at the book fair,"Prefeace to this review: I enjoy history and historical novels.This book is geared for the a movie screenplay (I can see why the recent movie was a failure)and not for historical value. I really don't have to read Frank Thompson's interpretation of Sam Houston and Santa Anna's love making, how the soldier's faces were blown off (who was there to record it and survive?), or his slow introduction of David Crockett.Thompson does try to portray a picture of the main characters before the Alamo began, but he always falls back to simple dialog and not solid and serious historical description.At first I was going to give this book one star but as time goes on, it does provide light reading and reminds you of images of John Wayne's movie of the Alamo.Best to buy used and sell used."
4,Review by Times Literary Supplement,"Terrorism authority and foreign correspondent Ronald Payne reviewed TERRORISM TODAY in the August 18, 2000 edition of the prestigious ""TLS""--Times Literary Supplement (London). Payne calls this book ""a masterly survey of the big picture of world violence"" and ""a comprehensive survey of what can be done to cope with the problem..."" The book ""provides many useful strategy recommendations which Western governments would do well to study. It also provides an up-to-date glossary of operational terrorist groups."" -CCH"
4,Terrorist Behavior,Harmon's work on terrorism should be required reading for professional and academic researchers in the subject area of terrorism and political violence. His many inline examples help to elucidate the relationships between fundamental political theories and terminologies to violent acts of extremism and fundamentalism. For me this book was important because it provided an additional point of reference to my research on terrorist organizational behavior and leadershipTerrorist Organizational Behavior(ISBN-13: 978-0615687391). I recommend this book to those interested in the behaviors of individuals and groups involved in terrorism.
5,Wise book,"I'm enjoying this book very much. I find that the author seconds ideas that I've had for a while myself, but thought there is no one out there who would agree with me. I find the book comforting and empowering."
3,land of the lost box set,"The dvd's were great and a nice trip back to when I was young. The complimentary lunchbox they came packaged in however, fell apart the first day."
4,"Fun, Corny, Dated, but Worth it.","I'm finding watching the original ""Land of the Lost"" series very fun and funny.The Krofft concepts of dinosaurs had some things in common with some of the Ray Harryhausen stop motion ""claymation"" style dino flicks. I loved dinosaurs as a child, and this show as a young teenage sci fi/fantasy fan.If you take it on it's own levels, a Sid & Marty Krofft production, it was probably one of their best efforts. Some interesting writers helped contribute some of the better story lines. It is/was a part of the TV culture of it's day, and had many young fans. You will enjoy it if you are still young at heart enough to suspend your disbelief and overlook some less-than-inspired acting.Drew"
5,A great value,"I bought the Land of the Lost,complete series (Limited Edition Gift Set)for my brother. He has already watched the whole set and he thought that thmtal lunch box was worth an extra $10.00 compared to just buying the dvd set.For those of us who used to take metal lunch boxes to school this was a trip down memory lane. I wish that moretelevision shows would coe out with lunch box ""bonuses"". I also received my order within four days after I placed the order and at no extra cost. I highly recommend this any ""Land of the Lost"" fan."
5,Fantastic stroll down memory lane!,I loved getting up on Saturday mornings to discover which Krofft Superstars show was going to be on. So I had a blast watching episodes many years later with my friend's seven year old son! Great!
4,Trip Back to Childhood,"The episodes are cheaply produced, the plots are thin, and the acting is over the top. This was an awesome show that was cancelled well before it's time. The 3rd season was the worst however, when Rick Marshall was replaced by the Uncle. Only those who recall watching it during Saturday morning cartoons will remember the awe of imagining living on an alternate plane of existance troubled by Sleezstack, odd phenomena, and clay-mation dinosaurs."
3,Not what I wanted,"I thought this was the 90's series of Land of the Lost but after purchasing I found out that never came out on DVD. Decided to keep it, haven't watched it yet."
1,ULTRA AMATEURISH this,"this is just painful for an adult to watch; and we have watched all the 'horror and others' at mill creek...some very good, some decent and some pretty bad...this set tho exceeds all levels of agony-viewing.the acting is as from a community group of the town idiots, the sets are embarrassing to any designer, the animation and 'creatures' are so dated and done so badly that they too are downright god-awful.maybe some kid might like these, but it would have to be a kid isolated from the current world, without having seen anything else of the same genre'.mediocre is to this as death valley is to mt everest...BAD"
4,Lnd odf the Lost,What can I say? If you grew up watching it and liked it then you like it. Bought this for my oldest son (9yrs old) and he loves the show.
5,Another Land of the Lost review.,"Sweet! I thought the lunchbox was going to be plastic but is not... The pictures don't show how detailed this thing is. Now I get to watch all the episodes I missed growing up in order...Update: No special features as other reviewers mentioned... Only a sneak peak at the movie... Interesting for the show to just end like that, it would be cool for a new series to come along and pick up where they left off, SciFi could do it."
5,Thank you,Received itme in mint condition. Thank you for efficient service and quality product at a good price
2,no bonus features,"i purchased this item in haste, not taking the time to read the details about this set. DVD5's not DVD9's so all of the bonus features, (including commentaries are missing) furthermore, the quality is not as nice as previous iterations. With the exception of the Osmonds' main theme music 'reboot' my 7 year old daughter loves the series, (including season 3). I'm just bummed that i shelled out the money for the DVD's and have no commentary. I could've just DVR'ed it from G4 and had the same thing."
1,Wha' ha' pen?,"For the amateur listener, much of piano music on this disc is appealing (Tchaikovsky's piano concerto, Debussy's ""Clair du Lune,"" a Mozart sonata, some Chopin etudes, etc.); however, the grainy imagery looks as if it were taken with somebody's camcorder or pulled from some stale archive of low-budget nature photography. Do not rent this disc with the expectation that you'll see stunning imagery worthy of HDTV or music comparable to a live concert experience. Also, Beethoven is way underrepresented--if at all--among these selections, which is an important message for today's youth."
2,worst staic-x ever,I am not sure what they were thinking but the music is not metal anymore it turned into electronic music but not the good kind
3,Average,"Is it me or does it always seem like a band that has a constant revolving door of musicians in it seems to eventually go down hill. I have been a fan of Static X for several years after I caught them on the Ozzfest with their first album. However, it seems like every album they go just a little bit more away from that signature sound. Not a bad record, just not one of the best either."
4,The best Static-X album yet,"Since their major label debut, 1999's ""Wisconsin Death Trip"", Static-X has never been able to meet, let alone top, their debut with any of their subsequent releases. Eight years later, they finally manage to accomplish this feat. ""Cannibal"" finds Wayne Static and co. pouring on their Ministry-flavored brand of industrial laced metal to some new headbanging heights, offering up a collection of songs that, well honestly, don't all sound the same. Standout tracks include ""Behemoth"", ""Destroyer"", ""Cuts You Up"", and the closing ""Team Hate"" are hard driving dirges that find Static-X expanding the territory that the band appeared to be ready to plunder with their promising debut of so long ago. It's good to see Static-X finally getting back on track after all this time with ""Cannibal"", but let's just hope that this time around the band doesn't get lost off the track again."
4,Pretty Good,"Just got this album and I've got to say it's pretty good. The Music has a hard bite to it and never stops punching your ear drums out. It has a fair amount of electronics in it that don't dominate the rest of the music. I see this move as more or less an answer to people that started to accuse the band of not being ""metal"" after Shadow Zone. Although ""Start A War"" Seemed to be good start to that answer, though few people here seem to agree with me on that one.Bottom line, for me personally. This album does not disappoint.... Grab it."
2,a disappointment,"I eagerly awaited the arrival of Cannibal, and was quite disappointed when I listened to it. To me, there just aren't any memorable songs. The songs sound very contrived, in that Wayne tried to throw stuff together just to preserve the Static-X sound, but the actual songs themselves are rather weak. He is trying to be ""heavy"" just for the sake of being heavy. Not that Static-X wants or needs a hit single, but there is nothing catchy that will stick in your head, a la ""Push It"" or ""The Only."" Overall, I think the band will never top Wisconsin Death Trip. If you are a hardcore fan, you will probably buy this, but if you are on the fence about it or just getting into the band, I would avoid this one."
3,WTF?!,"Start a War was a nice return to form and I figured more of the same with Cannibal but could not believe my ears when I first heard this. GUITAR SOLOS?! SHREDDING?! Guitar solos have no place in the musical realm of Static-X. End of story. This experiment is a total disaster and sounds downright silly amidst the standard ""Evil Disco"" fare that this band is known and loved for.The weak stripped down sound of the guitars doesn't help. Why on earth they would abandon the bone crunching wall of sound of WDT is beyond me.Time for Wayne to stop fooling around and go back to what made them popular to begin with. HEAVY guitars with lots of techno."
1,NEVERMIND!,"This band sucks theres bands way better than this one.These are just some stupid metal wannabes and this is NOT real metal okay,whoevers works with rappers are NOT real metalheads got that and i don't care what you say this is a stupid lousy band.Don't waste your money on this stuff,true metal is certainly not like this and i know someone is gonna say it doesn't matter what you listen your a real metalhead HELL NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
5,Another Great Album,Have liked Static-X since their inception and this album doesn't disappoint. Nothing like these guys
5,Best X yet,"A lot of great albums came out in 2007, and the ones I expected to love the most, sadly don't compare to Static-X's brutal return to form (well it's not so much a return as it is where they should be at by now). The songs are short and fast. The kind of intensity that made their debut so memorable. I can listen to this again and again.If you need to get your adrenaline pumping, look no further. If you've never tried Static X this should make you a fan."
3,Doesn't quite hit the mark,"First off ill say, when i gave this a first listen, i was ashamed that static x could have released this album. Im also not here to complain that this is not a new wisconsin death trip, their music changes and ive been happy with every change theyve made, including shadow zone which some people seem to hate. However, this disk lacks any lyrical performance, its just wayne spitting his lyrics as fast as possible, with a few exceptions. Those exceptions are few though and it gets boring. Musically, this is an awesome cd, the guitar solos are great, but waynes lyrics just didnt do it for me. Its an album with a lot of potential that could have been reached. Too bad, because start a war had great music and great lyrics."
2,"Close, but disappointed...","I purchased this watch for a friend as a gift, he was elated, initially. His wife thought it so nice that he should not wear it but rather put it away to pass down to his son. The problem with the watch was, there was no fine adjustment in the strap, so the watch was either to lose and turning on his wrist, or, too tight. I was heart broken. The watch now sits in a drawer somewhere and I imagine his son will see it soon anyway."
1,Do not buy,Keeps breaking...has been replaced twice now. Only 1 year limited warranty on the sprayer that keeps breaking and costs $29 to replace thereafter.
3,Flat,"To my ears, Willie's great chops are delivered just below pitch. Maybe it's his style to play like this? Anyway, the tunes are well performed and his band mates are quite competent."
4,A Great Camcorder,"This is probably one of the best consumer camcorders out there. Everything about it is quite impressive, like the night vision feature and the touch-screen LCD monitor. Most importantly its got a great picture and it does amazing with lighting which most digital camcorders don't. The size and wieght of this product is perfect for portable use and easy maneuverability. Overall this is a grreat camcorder and really lives up to its expectations and price."
4,Cool Handycam to possess,"I bought HC85 in July , but got a real chance to shoot for long hours only in October. I found all the controls very very effective and handy. also to add to its video the Still photographs that are captured at 2 Mega pixels are amazingly good. I also tested the Photographs by getting a print and its good enough and comparable with any other camera (2 mega pixel ofcourse).Though i am having a problem or rather some confusion about.1. Formatting the Video while getting it from tape to hard disk2. The video Quality when i view it after writing to VCD is not that good. Probably i am missing some setting while using itit would be great if someone could help me out on this."
4,The Jane Austen Book Club,"This is a great film, it inpspired me to join a book club in my local city. An amzing film for those who love to read!"
5,For lovers of Austin,"This is a great movie if you love a good story. You don't have to be overly familiar with the writings of Jane Austin to enjoy this - this is a movie to sit down with good friends, good wine and enjoy!"
3,The Jane Austen Book Club,I have not watched the DVD yet -- I'll let you know when I do. It arrived quickly and appeared to be new as promised.
2,jane austen book club,too long - found it quite boring- the feature on Jane was more interesting than the movie itself
1,"WARNING: IF YO LOVE JANE AUSTEN, DO NOT SEE THIS FILM!","Treacle on fruitcake. Does that sound like Jane Austen to you, Austen-lovers? If so, feel free to partake. Me, I wanna go throw up. Jane would be turning over in her grave."
1,Ugh...,"I was pretty excited about this movie, and almost bought the book. If the book follows the movie at all, I'm quite glad I didn't waste my time. The movie was really dry, boring, and just seemed like something thrown together to make money off of Austen fans. I actually felt a little used!"
1,Not recommended!,Jane Austen would be mortified to have her name attached to this movie! I was appalled that this movie was given a PG13 rating. I would never watch this movie with a teenager! I was totally unprepared for the emphasis placed on the relationship between a lesbian teenager and her various lovers. The characters in Jane Austen's stories had morals and practiced marital fidelity. Qualities totally lacking from this movie!
2,"Good idea, borderline laughable script.","An annoying movie in a lot of ways, mostly because the story is very dramatic and manipulated. Almost none of the characters are beleivable, and they are all dragged by the dull screenplay, which has the main purpose of first breaking all the relationships down and then creating one big happy ending for all. The discussion of Jane's work is forced, and not well integrated into the story, but only in very abrupt and obvious manner. Jane must be rolling over in her grave at this very hackneyed script."
4,A Fairy Tale - But a Good One,"This movie was totally cute - quiet and refreshing (really 3 and half stars). If you've read Austen's novels, you will obviously like the ""book club"" bits and see the parallels in these women's lives. I only had a small problem with the whole boys=sci-fi thing. Maybe it's rarer than I think, but I'm both a lifelong sci-fi/fantasy geek/fangirl and a Jane Austen aficionado. Hello? We are out there! I totally loved the reference to Star Wars. It's certainly not a point only a fanboy could make!**upon second viewing in 2010, i have amended it to four stars"
2,Are you kidding me?,"The 4 and 5 stars are given mostly by folks who never read Jane Austen. If you have, you will be sorely disappointed. This has very little to do with Jane Austen and one cannot help but feel that her name was used to promote the movie/book/whatever. The characters were poorly developed and the watcher/reader didn't care one way or the other how things turned out. When there were references to the actual works, they were extremely heavy handed and out of place. I felt embarassed more than anything else."
2,A little silly...,The actors all worked well with each other but the story just wasn't what I thought it should have been considering the subject. I did find some of the ideas about the premise behind some of Jane Austen's books interesting. It has a decent ending but I can't recommend it. I did see the edited version on an airplane so I don't know what was cut out.
1,Painful at times...,"You watch this film because of it's title and because you want to believe. Well, hope is not enough for this film that never gets a firm grip and often feels incomplete. The books and the discussions of Austen's books are the only things that do make sense in this film. The rest is several stories all in bits that never blend well.....never. The characters are just quickly passed on and loosely relate (the film hopes to show us this) to Austen's books in todays world. It does not succeed."
5,Loved it !,"This movie was really funny, smart, sad sometimes, it has a little bit of everything and that's what makes it great."
5,Jane Austen Book Club DVD,"If you love Jane Austen, you will love this movie. If you aren't familiar with her books/movies, you might be completely lost. Really enjoyed it."
4,Nice one to watch to clear your head,After going through a break up I found myself searching for movies that related to my experience. This movie was a nice way to relax on a Saturday afternoon and clear my head. It also had me wanting to read all of Jane Austens novels or at least renting them on dvd if the movies were out!
4,Funny and cute,"If you ever wanted to get a quick snapshot of most annoying things that happens in everyone's life, watch the start of the movie. It is so funny I could not stop giggling. But then the movie itself is just wonderful. It is smart and funny, it is all too human. There are so many characters but none feels neglected throughout the entire movie. Whoever wrote this screenplay was a smart person because no matter how long ago Jane Austen lived, her books are still affecting our moidern lives.The usual happy ending is a dead give away that this is a chick flick. But with all the laughter, it is actualy the kind of movie I recommed to anyone seeking to relax."
5,wonderful!,I am so glad I am on a good streak for movies lately :) this one is just wondeful!!! Enjoyed it thoroughly!!! Highly recommended!
2,Disappointing Mishmash,I am a fan of Jane Austen but I can't see that this film has much real relation to her. It is a collection--hodgepodge--of characters and storylines that don't really capture your interest because they are not really very interesting. The cast is okey but not great--they do an acceptable job with what they have to work with but none of them is particularly attractive or appealing. The connection to Austen is minimal--just the reading of her books by the club members and a half-baked attempt to somehow relate her characters to them. There is no real coherent progression of the various stories encompassed by the film and at the end everything is kind of thrown together slapdash for a traditional happy ending. I found it boring and disappointing.
3,"Good movie, without being heavy handed","This movie is good for relaxing and enjoying. I also developed a need to read all of Jane Austen. Excellent acting, and a good story."
2,lightweight chick-lit chick-flick,"Great premise, but the execution was so contrived; each Jane Austen book selection neatly reflecting in the life of one of the members. Shallow treatment, poor character development, and the obligatory Hollywood feel-good ending add up to a movie that may be fun to watch in parts, painful in others, annoying yet in others. At the end you feel like you do after eating a meal that tastes pretty good until you realize that the ingredients are bad for you."
5,Nice!,It came in the original package as advertised. I was very pleased with my purchase. Brad looks awesome !!!
5,Luxury Toys,"I spotted this coffee table book while working in an Archetects office and thought my two grown boys might enjoy perusing it's pages so I searched and found two like new copies, one on Amazon, and got them both for under $30 total...good buy!"
3,Reproduction,"While this was not the product I anticipated, but a reproduction, the seller quickly refunded the money when I requested it. So while I was disapointed with the item, I was very happy with the service I received to adjust the sale."
3,Nice Book But a Bit Old Fashioned,"I bought I HEAR on the recommendation of a Montessori educator I very much respect. They highly recommended Helen Oxenbury's series of four books about the senses.The illustrations are nice, and the design (one picture per page with two pages for each word) is great for learning to read and enjoy books.The one downside to this book is that out of six words, two are dated choices for ""sound"" words (which means that your baby is not likely to see/hear a real world example). One of those is ""watch."" The watch shown is an analog watch, with the expected sound is ""tick tick."" However, everyone I know has a soundless watch, either quartz or digital. Less annoying is the fact the the telephone shown has a rotary dial.It's a nice book, but I HEAR is not a book my 10-month-old son pulls out to read very often. Our 22-month-old friend does not get excited about this one, so the appeal may be limited to younger babies."
2,Don't buy stuff you don't know,This is crap. No wonder I never heard of these guys and one listen will tell why they never went anywhere
3,Not as Good as Lattimore or Merrill,"I studied & read Odyssey for a year. After poring through the various translations, my sense of the quality of this edition, in terms of translation, is sufficient, in terms of poetry, is severely deficient, and nearly grotesque butchery in a few sequences of great importance. If you would like more attention to poetry and content together, I would recommend Lattimore, or much much, better, the lesser known but comparatively magnificent Rodney Merrill's version, on Michigan University Press (sadly, I believe only the hardcover is available on Amazon, but the paperback will surely be available direct from the MUP)."
5,I was pleased,"I'm a college student, trying to make my way through school with limited means, and this bargain buy saved the day."
5,Overlooked marvelous movie,"In fact at some moment after veiwing the film for the 15-th time one starts to notice that Gazarra is in effect playing a role, one notes with critique that ""this could have been done differently"" and ""that could have certainly been done better"". But tell me what movie will pass this ""perfection"" test after 15 reviews? In fact there are too few films that are worth numerous re-veiwing and Saint Jack is one of the few.The movie is balanced, slow-pace and absolutely nostalgic for the 60-s and the old world order. Especially for those who were in South-East Asia in the 60-s and early 70-s.DVD sound seemed a bit strange - as if from a different source. Pic quality is O.K.This is truly a once a rare stuff that was absolutely impossible to get 3 years ago (I had been actually looking for it and the best I could get was a second-hand 13 years-old VHS tape on an e-auction - untill they made a DVD earlier this year)"
3,Trip Back to 1960's Singapore,"I live in Singapore so this was a fun trip back to a time when Singapore wasn't modern, clean and safe. Back in the 1960's Singapore was newly independent of Malaysia and was a bit of the wild east; much different than now. The Singapore government was embarrassed by this film and banned it for many years. It was never commercially exhibited here. The film is based on a Paul Theroux novel and is a pretty good story. Ben Gazzara is very good in the lead role. Denholm Eliot is excellent as a lonely, itinerant accountant that is visiting Singapore and is befriended by Gazzara's character. The director Peter Bogdanovich uses a lot of local actors and many locals that had no acting experience but all give very solid performances and give the film its realism. It's not great stuff, but fun especially if you know Singapore. (George Lazenby, one time James Bond, has a cameo as a gay congressman)"
1,Not The Toni Braxton Movie,"This is not the Lifetime TV movie, staring Toni Braxton, that was aired Feb 9 2013.Hope Toni's movie is released on DVD soon, because both her vocals and acting were totally fantastic."
3,DVD,I wanted another movie with the same name. My fault. I wanted Twist of Faith with Toni Braxton. So I did not watch this one and I will give it away.
4,Cool Cd,This is a very cool CD. It has good beats and is an awesome mix. I would definetly buy it if I were you. But the only problem is that is it is kind-of confusing. But it is great to dance to. So if you like dancing buy it today.
4,Five Thumbs Up!,"Witch Child is a great book...for young and old. When I first started it, from the first page I knew it was going to be great. I couldn't stop reading it, so eventually I finished it! I definitly think that there should be a sequal. Thanks!"
5,awesome,This is one of the best books I have ever read. I t has so much detail. It feels like you are standing with her you can picture how everything was. BUY IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
2,A disappointing book with character that loses your sympathy,"I was terribly disappointed with Witch Child. I had heard wonderful things about it, only to turn the last page feeling sort of, well, blank. Take out the middle hundred pages or so and it might be worth your time - but for a book about a girl's charge of witchcraft there is barely any news about it, and that only speculation that is faintly whispered here and there until the last chapter. It starts off well enough, is utterly maddening as you continue, is terribly fascinating, and then suddenly ends right when you're interested.For something worth reading in the same sort of category, readers would best try out ""The Raging Quiet"" by Sherryl Jordan."
3,Been there done that.......,"It was a decently written story - the characters were written well and the dialoge had a nice flow - but the end of the book was just a rehash of the Salem Witch trials - also the same scenes were played out in the movie Sleepy HollowIf you have never read anything about the Salem Witch trials or seen Sleepy Hollow then it is a good read, otherwise you will feel like you are reading a rerun!I am a avid fan of Fantasy but came away from this a bit disappointed!"
2,Uninteresting.,"Maybe I need to read the book again, as it's been several years since, but I'm not understanding the other reviews. I've nothing negative to say about this book other than the fact that it was a little dull."
2,Review: Witch Child by Celia Rees,"First off, I was not tremendously moved by this book. Celia Rees effectively created a realistic world for the 1600's, but the pace of this book was very slow leaving my mind to wander. Mary being an orphan and a witch was a couple of the very few things that we know about this main character leaving this book lacking in character build up. Over half of this book is dedicated to the killing of Mary Grandmother and her travel to America; which is not the main plot so in most cases I would have given up trying to finish this book. That being said I did complete this book, but it is nothing that I would recommend or want to continue the series."
5,History blends with the supernatural in a satisfying story,In 1659 Mary's grandmother is hanged as a witch and she escapes to America - only to find the same threat face her abroad. With the town rising in fear over witches Mary faces a growing conflict between her Puritan disguise and her real nature. History blends with the supernatural in this satisfying story.
3,Why?,"Why is it that I just don't like Celia Rees? I can't ever bring myself to finish one of her books. I read about 3/5 of that one about pirates but was so uninvolved and bored that I couldn't bring myself to finish it. And this book, I think I made it about 150 pages before admitting defeat and giving up. There's some thing about her writing style that just bores me and it feels like a struggle just to make it through.I know that this review will get about 0 out of 20 votes for helpfulness because everyone else who reviewed this book seemed to love it.I guess I'm writing to tell that small percentage of people out that, who like me, just don't like Celia Rees's books either, that this book bored me and I was easily distracted from it."
4,fabulous,"For staters lets get a few things straight. THIS IS NOT AN ACTUAL DIARY! it was NOT found in a quilt, that's just the author really getting you into the story. and she did a fabulous job to! i really love the first half of it, on the ship and stuff. i was very dissapointed with the end though. it didn't keep me interested as much. the very last line of the diary is just plain aful, cutting us of in the middle of a non cliffhanger sentence. but the first half most defiantly deserves five stars and i reccomend this book to anyone."
2,The Witchchild review,"Do you like books that make you sleep!This book is called Witch Child, written by Celia Rees. It is about a girl named Mary. She had been left to her grandmother, who was a witch. Mary does not know why she was left with her grandmother, because her grandmother would never talk about it. The people in the town got suspicious of the grandmother and killed her. Then Mary was taken away for her protection and put on a ship bound for America to have a better life. The book goes on and talks about the trip to America. It ends with a twist, but I don't want to give the ending away.I would recommend this book to someone that would like the Dear Diary books, or someone that has read them, because they are sort of historical fiction about boys and girls and their adventures in moving to and living in America. Because this book is not really about witches and magic, Witch Child may not be what the reader expects it to be."
3,Excellent Description--plot falls flat,"I felt that once the wonderful beginning was over, I could anticipate what would happen next many chapters ahead. Witch Child has lovely description and carefully drawn characters, but no new thoughts on its subject."
3,witch hunt preety good,After reading Witch Hunt I was tired.Because it was not very exciting.But this is a good book overall.It's about a young girl in the witch trial years named Mary.After seeing her grandma burned at the stake she runs off.This story takes you many places even the english country side.So if you like adventures books read this story.by:Hunter
2,Disappointing,I thought this book was going to be a whole lot better but I guess I was wrong. I couldn't focus on the main point of the story. It was everywhere and anywhere.Mary was a granddaughter that was a witch. So they killed Mary's granddaughter they burned her. To figure out if anyone is a witch they would throw them in water and if they floated that was how they could tell if they were a witch.One of the grandmothers friends took Mary and had a whole life picked out for Mary. Mary left England to go to America to start a whole new life.If you like to read books that contain witches and old times then this is the book for you. If not then don't read it.
1,Not in my interest,"Well not bashing the book or anything, but this book just totally bored me in every way. I couldn't even finish it, I read the first 170 pages and just had to stop! I couldn't read anymore. To me this book seems like it would be more in the interest of an older reader, not as much as a younger reader."
3,"Promising, But Doesn't Deliver","It wasn't exactly the best book I've ever read, but I'm by no means ready to ""burn it at the stake,"" either. Witch Child has an intriguing plot and a compelling focis. However, emotions hardly scratch the surface, and empathy is virtually impossible. Character emotions are arbitrary at best and you never feel as if any of these people are more than words on paper. You feel nothing for Mary's plight and I admit I found it contrived at times. None of the horror of the witch phenomonon, or, for that matter, its magnitude is discussed, and I found in reading a hole amidst a story with such magnificent promise. A good read, a quick one, too, written well and captures the imagination, but sadly misses becoming truely great."
5,Unique,I am half way through the book and let me tell you one thing. This book is unique. It is one of the best books I have read. The way it is written (even though paragraphing and grammer was changed) makes it stand out and screams real. I have always been interested in the Witch Trials and this book lets you see how someones life was torn apart because of people that were scared and had no hearts. This book is a one of a kind and extrodanary.
4,Just a normal child witch,"One of the reasons I enjoyed this book was the simplicity of the story while offering young readers the chance to have a history lesson of life in 1600's. The young main character, Mary, is set on a course of life where she is offered opportunities to change or stay true to her spiritual path as a witch. I think the word ""witch"" alone sets up a red flag for the reader. Assumptions and prejudices are foremost in the readers' minds but as the story unfolds we learn being a witch is a choice for living spiritually as is any person who choices a spiritual path. Mary must make choices and is supported by those who understand her and I think that is what the young reader wishes to experience in her or his life, understanding. I will and have, recommended this book for younger and older people interested in understanding witches. Easy read."
1,A NEVER READ book,"I think that this is the absolute WORST book I have EVER read. Who would believe all of that [...]?!?!?!?!?!?!Take my advice, never even LOOK at this book again. Celia Rees seriously scares me. She actually believes in witches and ghosts and things. She actually believes that there was once a Mary Newbury, she believes it so much that she put a link in the back of the book for people to contact her if they have any info on Mary Newbury. I gave a report about this book and my whole class was creeped out by this book and mostly by Celia Rees. The only person who wasn't, was a total nerd. Please don't make the same mistake I did. Please don't be a nerd!"
5,Rahong3,"This game is indeed a challenge, I already had The Curse of Ra and completed all levels except 46, couldn't break code so if someone out there was able to get this level I would love to hear how, Am just starting the other Ra games, so will be interesting, and challenging, I am 52 years old, so it goes to show you are never to old for video game challenges. thanks"
4,RahJongg: 3 in 1 Pack,"Bought this to replace one the wife was using on her old Windows XP PC. Was concerned that it might not work in a WIN 7 environment - but no issus - works great and of course wife is happy!!As usual, rather make my purchaes via Amazon, then somewhere I have never dealt with."
4,old game,this is an old game but lots of fun and the extre games are a challange. plays great on my new pc
2,Nothing practical but theoretical,"I bought this assigned textbook for the class. Yes, I admit it's indeed the bible of inventory theory, but if you want to learn something pratical, don't touch it. It explains everything by its overwhelming notations and formulations without realistic examples. I am a M.Eng student and want to learn something to apply in my job, but it makes me have no idea about what I can do after reading thoes countless proof of contless formulations within the whole book. This is definitely for someone who wants to dive into his PHD dissertations."
4,"Slayer rocks, this box set.... err","well i love slayer and all metal. this boxset still leaves me trying to decide. The big box thats 95 bucks or w/e is a ripoff, so i definatly suggest getting this one if your going to get one at all. it has loads of songs, some of my favs infact. but meh.. im dissappointed. i shelled out 55 bucks for this i thought it could have had more. still i like it, and listen to it a lot. however im recommending this to diehard fans only, or beginners that are just trying to start a collection, although i think buying the individual CDs would be a better idea."
2,mixed feelings&#65533;,"this is why i gave it two stars:it contains the 'criminally insane -remix' 12""EP. if you own the original of this (like myself) there is waaaaaaay too much treble in the mix for 'aggressive perfector'. at least on here it's at a normal/ listenable levelthings this needed to be a 5 star review:-live material from the 'Ultimate Revenge' video on the DVD... simply the best live Slayer material anywhere...-better 'rare' songs... demo's with axe tracks only? no dice...-cheaper price. too much money for something that most every slayer fan owns. and the rare trax to boot aren't worth it.i don't know... good for some things, terrible for most everything."
4,"The gods of thrash and satanic music, good ol slayer","Its good that Slayer has put together a box set of there best songs and others... and im a big slayer fan... did i mention it has all there best songs. The only problem i had with this is it costs like 90 something bucks and thats if u get it cheap. I feel like i've betrayed slayer by downloading the box set but its to dam expensive for an idiot like me. If your new to slayer listen to Angel of death, south of heaven, seasons in the abyss, 213, and of course in my opinion and probably yours there best song Raining BLOODDDDDDDD!"
1,A hundred bucks? Ha! What a wash.,"I started out a Slayer fan making 5 bucks an hour and working at Jack in the Box, Soundtrack to the Apocolypse shows its face 15 years after that fact, now Im making 50 bucks an hour, however I would never blow 100 bucks on this. Come on guys. About the only thing worthwhile in this thing is the cover of ""Memories of Tomorrow"" and you better believe I'll be downloading that bright and early at work tomorrow morning. Come on Dave Lombardo, you belong with Mike Patton. Slayer is yesterdays news, at least with Fantomas your making some cool new music (term used loosely)."
1,An Overrated band who have gotten too much credit for their work!,"I am a fan of metal, and everyone knows about the big 4 in the 80's. Withouth a doubt, Slayer is the worst of the 4, which is pretty bad considering the fact that Anthrax aren't very good either. I've been listening to metal for at least 11 years, since the age of 9, and I had always heard about Slayer, and how good the drummer is, which is a total crock of shi@ if you ask me. When you listen to Slayer, all you hear is a bunch of noise produced by the drummer just pounding away without thought. Also, the singer has the most wretched sounding voice ever in a legitimate metal band. The guitar work is anything but impressive, I've heard much better out of musicians like Mike Denner, Hank Shermann and Andy LaRoque to name only a few. If you want some really evil satanic music that's actually convincing, check out Mercyful Fate/King Diamond. Slayer is not as great as everyone says."
2,"If you're a slayer fan, you should have half of this already","Ill tell you why im disappointed first: 1) this doesnt have all their rarities- SITA(with the flute), war ensemble(hellraiser remix)? What about theyre actual videos, war ensemble, seasons, dittohead, serenity in murder, i hate you, raining blood/black magic live? I downloaded their very old songs and I didnt like them and the reign in blood demos(theyre good). One thing that actually pissed me off is that they said they were rerecording some old stuff for a box set a few years ago....so where are those???? Bottom line, if you dont have all theyre albums, go for this, but if your like me and do, skip it."
2,Doesn't live up to the reputation,"I just returned from the trip through Germany for which I bought this map. I suppose if you are traveling far off the beaten path, the enormous detail might be helpful. But if you are planning on using major highways, such as the Autobahn, this is a very hard map to follow. The highway numbers appear as tiny, unhighlighted print next to the roads, and you could kill yourself trying to figure out where you are. The free maps my cousin got me from the German auto club (ADAC) were infinitely more useful."
4,Getting in the mood,"This thing is great. When she walked into the bedroom I just hit the remote and the right ""mood"" music started playing softly to help her relax and get in ...well, the mood. The only problem I see is that you have to lift your arm up and point the remote at it to turn it off, when all you want to do at that point is sleep. Well worth the money."
4,Great Buy,"Reasonably priced. Actually works great. Got tired of having to turn my PC on to charge up my Sansa e250. Have not tried to connect it to my PC as it is in another room. Hooked up powered 2.1 speakers to it and it rocks the house. All the stero I need.Remote control is limited On/Off, Volume Up/Down, Track Next/previous. Still a basic function remote control"
3,The Poorly Built Sansa Base Station,"This does not match the build quality of the lil'monsta it hosts.Either the remote doesn't work or connections are flimsy.I returned mine when it had a missing part, the item the sent me back didn't have a working remote. I've had it with this item!Thankfully my Logitech Harmony can control the device. Its convenient is all."
3,sdamx-bst sansa base station,it is ok but the connection to sony home theater doees not funtion as the item should have HDMI.......or similar...
1,Order Cancelled Without Explanation,"We already have this unit for another player we have and are completely satisfied with the product. However, when we ordered another for Christmas this year we were surprised to see the only vendor amazon has for this unit dropped the ball. The order was cancelled without any email or other explanation, too late for us to re-order with someone not connected to amazon. This is the first time since amazon started out that we have had this happen. Unfortunately, I am seeing a trend by amazon to utilize third-party vendors more for electronics. Too bad they are proving unreliable."
4,"Looks Great, Works Even Better",I got the SanDisk SDAMX-BST as an add on to a home theater system and am very happy with the look of the unit and the interface to the audio system. The Remote is compact but versatile. I would recommend this unit to anyone.
2,would be GREAT if....,I love the product but two of the four features don't even work!The remote control flat out doesn't work. I've replaced the battery multiple times so it's clearly a defect.And the 'audio out' outlet doesn't work. I have to go through the mp3 player to get any sounds at all- which defeats the whole purpose of a docking station with an 'audio out.'I will be requesting a replacement to see if I have the same problems. If I do then don't buy thisproduct. If I don't then it was just manufacturer error and this is a great product.
4,"Great product, with a few annoyances","I got this dock to hook up to my theater system. It looks nice, and does exactly what it is supposed to do and it does it well. There are however some minor annoyances that wouldn't be so annoying if I hadn't paid what I did for this.1. Power cable easily disconnects from back of dock.2. Base needs more weight in it, moves around too easily.3. Remote and Base collect more finger prints than dust.4. Remote seems as if it needs to be pointing directly at the front of the unit and can only be used at no more than 10'. The further away you are the harder it is to get the base to pick up the signal."
4,Great item...,I purchased this and am quite pleased with it. I would give it 5 stars but the remote is REALLY chintzy and has no way to get back to the menu from the remote (on the Sansa e280 you push the power button once and let go to return to the menu...it doesn't work to try that with the remote power button). It is otherwise very nice and is black and glossy and matches the Sansa e280 perfectly.
5,Great Personal Business Story,"I'm an avid reader of biographies, especially those of women who get it together to do something really worthwhile, and at the same time take care of a family. Having bought maternity wear at Mother's Work, I was interested and excited to read the story of the founder. Rebecca Matthias did not disappoint! It's an inspiration to see what an ordinary person can do with a great idea and a lot of determination."
1,TOO SELF ABSORBED/ LACK OF SELF DEPTHi,"It seems that the business took over and needed the help of mother, husband, kids. I would have preferred the wisdom of a well-rounded person. This is not an inspirational book rather than a frightening view of a woman, forgetting that there is something outside her secluded existence."
3,MothersWork,This is not an easy book to read from cover to cover. I had expected more from this book. She does encourage others to write a business plan and submit it in a contest at the very end.
5,"A business book that is truly inspirational, real and funny!","You can do it is the attitude of this book! Rebecca Matthias writes of her experiences starting a business out of her home with the depth and flow of a favorite river. It is always flowing and never too deep that you loose interest or have to stop to figure out what she is saying. The author tells of her own experiences in colorful situations that make you laugh and at times feel the frustation and stress she went through while starting a family and building Mothers Work, Inc. into the biggest maternity apparel company in the world. I highly recommend this book to any woman looking to start her own business and could use the inspiration and/or blue prints. Each chapter recaps like a business book but it by far more enjoyable to read than any business book I can think of. I passed it on to a friend who enjoyed reading it too!"
5,A very inspiring book,"The book is very inspiring and describes a real case study of a woman who done pretty well for herself and her business. For any woman that thinks about getting into business, it should be highly encouraging. I found it to be a great source of help and fun to read. In order to actually start establishing your own business, you might want to read additional books with more detailed explanation on the steps required to open the specific business you are thinking about. I must admit, I couldn't resist and read it twice."
4,Autobiography of Mother's Work Founder (Mainstream Maternity Clothes),"An amazing success story that will at least inspire you to think about getting off your duff and pursuing your ambitions. Keep in mind that many of the sacrifices Rebecca makes are not for everyone like living with your parents, feeding your family fast food frequently, and having no time for friends. Rebecca saw the need for fashionable maternity clothes which led to A Pea in the Pod, Motherhood and a few other chains."
2,InterAct V4 not so great,"I have had the wheel for some time now (1 yr) and havn't been too impressed with it. It seemed to work OK for NFSIII Hot Pursuit (which it came with), but I have had no end of problems getting it to work with Monaco Grand Prix Racing Simulation 2. In Monaco, the pedals don't work, you are either wide open throttle, or hammering the brakes. Because of this, I can not comment on the steering response (it is difficut to tell when you wheels are always spinning or locked). No other racing games yet, but I'm looking for a good one. This wheel seems to be getting varried reviews, some love it and others hate it (complaints of delayed response). Look closely into this one before you purchace it."
1,Mostly crap - don't be lured by the price,"I'm surprised at the number of good reviews I've seen on this wheel - combined with the low price point, I had to get one. The install was smooth, until I updated the drivers and got VXD errors when I started Windows. Simple enough to fix, but annoying. The force feedback simply doesn't work well. In Rally Champsionship, it works great for about 30 seconds and then quits. In Midtown Madness, all I get is collision effects. Same thing with Need for Speed III. Maybe I'm the exception rather than the rule, but this one is going back."
2,Looks Great! But Watch Out...,"Wheels MUST be compatible with your sound and video cards or they won't work right. My installed sound card was not compatible, and tech support told me ""its not ever going to work with that sound card."" (C-media was the sound card manufacturer.) I then bought what tech support recommended (any Sound Blaster), so I bought SB X-Gamer. Now the wheel works for about ONE lap of one race, in ""Need For Speed: Hot Pursuit"". The wheel eventually stops responding, and your car spins in a left-hand turn, or crashes. (I do enough crashing on my own, and don't need the help.) If all you want to do is look at it, this is a terrific wheel. But if you plan to use it, be prepared that you might have to replace half the components in your computer with expensive, name-brand stuff, to make it work."
3,Wheel Very Good During Race,"I bought that V3 racing wheel a while back, which is the brother to this one, and found that it gave you great control during game play and was very accurate on steering. The only bad thing was when it broke. I don't know exactly what happened but something on the inside turned loose. It's great, but kinda made cheap."
3,It's is O.K.,"When I first got it, it looked intimidating. It was hard toset up and I ended up calling tech support. Don't try it on theweekend. The steering wheel is good and I don't mind the buttons and it came with suction cups to help the clamps. Pedals are pretty good, a little flimsy though. I gave it 3 stars because the set-up as awful and tech is helpful if you can reach them. Good on racing games and driving all together."
2,One of the better pepper books,"I have a hugh selection of pepper books, this is one of the best. Great illustrations, good listing of pepper types and sources, and great, yet simple receipes. If you grow peppers , as I do, the section on gardening is straight forward. A hint, always grow larger types in a cage."
3,Great Table - Doesn't include chairs!,This is a great table. Just the right height for us. Note: don't let the photo confuse you into thinking it includes two chairs! (this includes only the table). You have to order the chairs separate.
4,Sturdy bar table,"I got this product in the walnut finish. The table is pretty sturdy and solid. Like another poster mentioned, the directions are just pictures without words. However, I found the assembly pretty easy and straight forward so I didn't mind that the directions weren't spelled out. Overall good price for a quality product. Make sure you pay attention to the fact that the stools aren't included."
4,Just what we expected,"Order was shipped quickly and everything was in good shape. Tables are of excellent quality. Looks like we'll have them for a long time. We ordered two and our only disappointment was that if we set them facing each other (as a square), the legs stick out so there is a small gap on the tabletop. We'd bought them so we could stand them side by side to make a long table but move them so they face each other and make a square. We can throw a tablecloth over them so they'll still work. Otherwise, they're nice tables. Well worth the money."
4,perfect size,This table goes in from of a tall window seat in the Keeping Room. Be sure to check parts upon receipt as we had to have them send another leg...which they did very quickly.
2,"Nice, but difficult to put together",Nice but hard to assemble- the directions only contain pictures without words to direct you. Be sure to align the pre-drilled holes as you assemble.
1,Not for me.,"I am second wife and stepmom of two teens for more than three years; I have many problems as most women in similar relationships. I am Christian as well so I thought this book would be perfect for me!I have just finished reading the book of Rose Sweet and I am really disappointed.Why?This is a book for real novices; if you are a second wife or even fiancée for more than a year, either your marriage does not exist any more, or you have learned all Ms. Sweet's tips by yourself.If your husband has physical custody of his kids, of this book is not for you.If you are Christian but the sentence: ""(name), God has shown me that I need to ask your forgiveness for something. Will you forgive me for my bitterness toward you? Will you also forgive me for having failed as your wife?"" is not exactly in your style, this book probably is not in your style as well.If your husband is not in love with his previous wife any more you should probably look for another book."
2,Barely watchable,"Let me start by saying that the film is decent. Dennis Hopper is in good form and the rest of the leads (with the exception of Patrick Wayne and a few of the supporting actors who are wooden and bland) do a decent job.That said the DVD itself is a disaster. The picture is out of frame and slightly blurry, the color is washed out and the soundtrack is full of clicks, pops and other noises. What always makes these rip-off releases even more of a joke is they sport the phrases ""Digitally Re-mastered"" and ""5.1 Digital Dolby Surround Sound"" on the back. Try to imagine 5 speakers all blasting clicks, pops and other annoying noises. If the manufacturers would just be honest (and some are) and say that the disc contains anomalies, people might be more forgiving.What a waste of money."
3,RX5,"I felt like the C/D wasn't finished. Some of it was great, but the sound and mix were not quite there."
2,"Secular, skeptical, and at times blasphemous; poor overall","While several of the videos were fairly well done, overall the ""mysteries of the Bible"" always seemed to be...did it ever really happen? or did it really happen the way the Bible says? To me it seemed to have an overall aura of attempting to discredit what the Bible says, not trying to find evidence to support it.In particular, ""the lost years of Jesus"" went over the top suggesting Jesus became a student of Buddha and His ministry was influenced by Buddhist philosophy. A few other videos were entertaining, but no new information was given, and I really learned nothing that I didn't already know from the Bible or other historical sources."
3,It's okay.,This set didn't impress me at all. It quoted the Bible incorrectly each time it quoted the Bible. The people didn't really know what they were trying to disprove and it only makes for proving the Bible.
5,Mysteries of the Bible,"I found this series to be very informative, well produced and thought-provoking. Enjoy it very much."
4,Wife ordered this cannot evaluate fairly,Cannot evaluate but must do so to dispose of reminders to do so. makes it difficult.
5,secure the cd's,nice try... any body who can help me secure the cd's... since the link has been cutoff at bowstring
1,Misrepresentation,"This book may perhaps be enjoyed by readers who are already disposed to believe its thesis, but is unlikely to convince anyone who expects that thesis to be backed up by competent research and honest citation of sources. To give just one example: my own book ""Sado: Japan's Island in Exile"" is cited to support the statement that ""more than a thousand Korean slave laborers ... on Sado Island also vanished without a trace"" (bottom of p.62). This is a deliberate misrepresentation; my book says no such thing. It is shameful for any writer to distort the work of another in this way."
4,exciting yet grim,"This book was a bit depressing in its depiction of the corruption of politicians, bankers, military personnel, and federal officers. But it was also an exciting, adventuresome read about the treasure hunt aspect.Raised intriguing questions about monetary policy vs. the gold standard, and highlighted the inconsistency between our treaties with Germany and Japan.The reason I am rating 4 stars instead of 5 is that I think they authors/editors should have put a little more effort into integrating some of the CD-ROM content into the book. The main part of the book is just under 250 pages, with zero diagrams or pictures, followed by 80+ pages of end-notes and bibliography. (The 4-page index is barely worth mentioning except to note that it is incomplete and has errors.) Since I checked out the book from the public library, I did not have access to the CD-ROM, so I would have appreciated at least a few diagrams interspersed along with the text."
5,Gold Warriors,"Great book. It will change or confirm all of your Knowledge of the late 20th Century politics. Seagraves does a masterful job with a difficult subject. It confirms that there are inter-connections between politicians,governments,Banks, criminal families and religions. I left with the feeling that Americans are much to naive about their government."
4,Good Build...Really Heavy,"This lens is decent. It's good for cheap. It's really heavy, and built really well. But I don't think it's as high quality as the more expensive lens for High Definition video. We'll see if I even continue to use it because it is so heavy. But a wide angle is pretty important for certain shots."
2,Wouldn't recommend,"I'm more than halfway through this, and would not recommend it. Perhaps Lavery's other titles on Nelson are better-- this one almost seems like an ignorant editor just ripped out sentences & paragraphs from a longer work & put this out as an excerpted work. The writing is clumsy and often unclear throughout; points aren't made that should be; and the overall tone is too hagiographic to represented a balanced study, even as a sketch of Nelson's life.Nice packaging, though, and some good artwork and battle/harbor scene prints from Pocock & the Naval Archives. But even many of these are too small to make much use of."
3,Dico 541-788-4 Nylalox Flap Brush 4 inch 240 grit,I was a bit disappointed as it didn't do what I expected. It is very good as a polishing of the wood in tight areas and curves. It doesn't sand off lines. It is very durable and will try to find more uses for it.Thanks
3,Okay review book.,"This book(blue) contains way too much information, it would be a good guide to use during the school year but for cramming students this is definitely not the book the buy. Also, the review section answers are filled with mistakes, almost every other section has one or more wrong answers (the reading contradicts with the review session answers). I wouldn't recommend this book but for a reference it would be okay."
5,Great for the right audience,"The main game start in a backyard where you master the basic controls, moving into kitchen where you try your best not to alert the grandma which starts trowing tomatoes at you, and so forth. Also, comes with a smaller cooking game, that kind of models after the Cooking Mama.The graphics are nice, the controls are smooth, and it's modeled after a hugely popular character. So, my 7-year old nephew really loves it.However, if you're an adult stuck playing this game, complaining of how simple or mundane the games gets should be the least of your concerns."
4,Not quite the same as the PC version,"This game is fun. I like the fact that you don't have to ""battle"" anyone to finish a level, and the fact that it saves more often. It is also nice that it can save 3 profiles, so siblings can share one game card. The cooking half of this game is rather enh. It only consists of chopping a million (okay, not quite a million) different ingredients, stirring and dropping them in the pot, and plating. If you want a cooking game, go for cooking mama instead. I do like the adventure half of this game, however. I have played it several times without being bored of it, and helped my sister finish a level or two. One thing I was dissapointed about was the fact that it doesn't have the different dreamworld levels to play, as those were my favorite part of the pc game. Other than that, it is a fun game that should last a while."
3,Ratatouille,"The graphics are good, but the cooking game isn't so great. It takes a while to get the hang of it, and it quickly gets monotonous. The story mode is fun, but it really takes two people or three hands. You must operate the control keys (+) and the letter keys while moving the rat with the stylus simultaneously. Only buy this game if you think that that is no problem."
3,ok,I got this for my 6 year old. He asked & asked for it then played with it for about an hour & hasnt really since. oh well.
4,Pretty Nice!,I bought this game for my little sister and she loved it!!! After you have seen the movie to play with it is really fun!!! Perfect!
4,Good book,"I liked the ""Humanoid Robot"" book a little better, but this book helped avoid some of the pitfalls from building a creature, without spoiling any of the fun."
3,Missing Autonomous Operation and Teaching Robot,"I suggest finding another book if your looking for ""Autonomous Operation"" or ""Teaching your robot to think for itself with free software"". I didn't find any software mentioned or any chapter or even a page covering autonomous operation. I found only a couple of sentences mentioning how they were able to do this. Besides that the book is a good buy for some ideas and lots of references."
3,"Dj Hardware should stick to what he does best, and not this.","Leave the breaks to Dj Icey or Simply Jeff, please! Dj Hardware should stick to what he know best, and that is progressive house, trance, acid.... NOT BREAKS! This album defenitly has his style, but it does'nt sound good with breaks. Dj Hardware fans beware! Don't by this untill you hear it's entireity, and you know for sure you like it."
3,Does what it says on the tin...,"I wanted to read about Manolete when I heard about the sad way he died, despite not being a bullfighting ""fan"". The book is rather shallow, as it tells about the death of Manolete - and not much else. However, the events leading up to Manolete's death are interesting: he was a very tired 30yr old man who wanted to retire, but he was pushed on by an audience who wanted more than he had left to give, and challenged by a cocky young rival. Then, one false move, and he's on the operating table.At the time, there was no inquiry as to WHY he died - it was assumed that the goring killed him. Perhaps the final twist in the story is that it is now believed that an incompatible plasma transfusion may have really killed him, but unfortunately this wasn't discovered till the 1990s, well after Barnaby Conrad wrote his book."
4,The Death of Manolete,"This is a difficult book to review, you have to have a passion for bullfighting, and after living in Spain for 14 years I definatly have a passion for bullfighting, this book is about one of the most talented matadors in the history of the bullfight, his artistry, and dedication were a true insperation to all who tried to follow in his shadow. I would recomend it to all who would like to know the person better, and have an open mind about bullfighting."
4,One of the greatest matadors ever,"Though I haven't read this particular book yet, I know a lot about Manolete and his death (and to many, Spain's greatest bullfighter). I bought this book just to have it because Barnaby Conrad thought him a great bullfighter and I wanted to add this book to my collection of books on bullfighting like ""Or I'll Dress You In Mourning,"" ""The Dangerous Summer,"" ""Death in the Afternoon."" I think Hemmingway one of the best documentors of the ""Fiesta Brava"" but he did not particularly like Manolete hence, the ""why"" I bought this book."
2,"After the Rain, Oh the Beautiful Rainbow","I was disappointed in the content. I expected more information on the Lymes Disease and the effects it had on Sarah. All this was was an A to Z of things she liked, disliked, etc."
1,Sucks shi*,"Ha, ha. I heard A.R. Yngve gets so mad when people criticize his work. What loser gets mad when people do that. Let's all laugh at his lame attemptsto promote his own work."
5,Klaus Kinski is the Anti-Christ and should have been elected Pope.,"I feel as though my life would have been incomplete had I never seen this movie. Klaus's lunacy fueled by Werner's meth amphetamine dependancy are a recipe for unprecedented hilarity and hijinx. I could not stop laughing from the first frame to the inspired rolling of the credits (which in and of themselves should have been nominated for an oscar for art direction.) As a matter of fact, I have not been able to stop laughing since I saw this film (and I last saw this film 8 years ago.) Bully!!! to Werner who has created an unparalled portait of a lunatic and his love of romantic literature. If you watch the beginning of this movie and are not convinced by Klaus's portrayal of Jesus that in fact KLAUS IS THE CHRIST then I think you would not be my choice for participating in an Algerian War of Independence reenactment. More's the pity, or as Klaus would say ""f$ck off with your silly stupid ugly faces of nonchalance."" Genius."
5,Out With The New,"Forget those awful CGI-fests made for the modern era, this is the real deal!A classic style adventure film, animated as only the 1980s could, this movie is filled with great songs presented in full music video style, tense action scenes, international intrigue, and comedy gold. Guaranteed to entertain children and adults!Take it form someone who's seen it as both. I loved it as a kid, and it holds up today over 20 years later. This is the Chipmunks and Chipettes as they were meant to be."
3,Big band cocktail lounge in Havana,"A nice mellow sound for background music, but nothing with salsa to make you want to samba or such. No Latin or African influences are audible."
3,A nice reference,"A good reference book for anyone that has a number of prescriptions and would like to learn how they work and of what to be aware. It does very well as a family reference book. It isn't comprehensive, but a book like that would be too daunting (and too thick!)."
1,Something big is missing ...,"I bought this book because I liked the stile it is written - very concise and objective and all was achieved by using plain language. The bad thig is that because of some unknown reason some of the major drugs are unexplicably left out (e.g. flecianide/tombacor, one of the major drugs used for treatment of heart rhytam disorders is nowhere to be found); also, some others are 'hidden' behind their original name so no generic/comercial names can be found in the book's reference (how I should know what is the other name for Sotalol).These are two serious omisions related to this book and I personaly don't think this book should be even on the market - it's incomplete and, as you may not be able to find your drug, actualy useless!They used to have editors to check books before they hit the bookstores - what happened here?So - avoid at all costs!"
5,Great to Find these items still,"I was afraid that I wouldn't find this item. But did, and it fit great, works well and I am very pleased."
4,You have to love Dijon mustard to love this mayonnaise,"I bought this brand because it was recommended by Nourishing Traditions author Sally Fallon. It's got too much Dijon mustard taste for me - that's not what I think of when I think of mayo. Another brand that follows Fallon's guidelines is Wilderness Family Naturals mayonnaise - also has a mustard flavor, but not as strong."
2,Viva Amazon!!,"Your service is the best. My package arrived promptly, and very well packaged -- it was glass -- very important. And the product is exactly as advertized -- I'd just got back from Paris and fell in love with their French mayonaise -- looked for it online -- found it on your site, sent for it, and it's perfect. Thank you. Kelly Lange"
5,BLUE CRAB GURU IS THE MASTER!,"Whitey knows his crabs, his crabhouses, and where the best ones are located. He doesn't mix in foodie terms, trends, or hype to confuse and confound those looking for a great meal. As a newcommer to the Chesapeake Bay, I have used Whitey's recommendations to locate some pretty tasty eating establishments and have experienced some sublime crabs! Reliable? Yes! Thank you, Whitey!"
