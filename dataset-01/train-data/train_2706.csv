3,"Cute, but cheaply made.","This product was cute once put together, but was made out of very cheap material. The screws that were provided were too long so they punched a hole in the opposite side of the rocking chair. The wood started splitting once we began screwing the pieces together. Some of the pieces were already put together in the box (the arms, seat, etc.), but some of these pieces had to be reinforced with super glue once the rocking chair was put together because they were already coming apart. I do not recommend this product for outdoor use."
3,Looks nice but breaks easily,This chair wasn't hard to assemble even without directions. My problem with the chair is the quality of the wood. Our chair broke after a week of use by a small child. The chair looks nice but probably won't last long. First the seat kept coming off and then the leg actually broke. I definitely wouldn't recommend using power tools to assemble it.
4,Insightful,"The book certainly broadened my understanding of the abolitionist movement and Brown's pivotal role as a role model for the Union's prosecution of the war, and the Transcendentalist’s role in establishing Brown’s heroic image during that period. I do find it interesting that even today the author seemed to not be comfortable with rationalizing Brown’s use of violence to bring down slavery. This in spite of the extreme acts of violence perpetrated by the proponents of slavery, especially in respect to the atrocities they committed during the sorry years of “bleeding Kansas.” All in all a very good book."
1,There are better biographies of John Brown,"Don't waste your time on this book. Find and read Otto Scott's ""John Brown and the Secret Six"" which has plenty of evidence of the terrorist roots of John Brown and his band."
3,"Only read this if you are passionate about this topic, and not a casual fan","I have to agree with several of the other reviewers that this book is too long, and could have been shortened considerably to make the narrative more cohesive. It's not till the final third of the book that Harper's Ferry is finally explored. Furthermore, it would have been interesting for the writer to go into greater detail about the relationships between Brown and the other men at Harper's Ferry, like Newby, Leary, and some of the lesser known personalities that helped with the raid. Also, I felt that the author was a little too partial toward Brown, because the author tried to justify all of Brown's flaws. Personally, I am not against Brown, but it would have been nice to have had a bit more balance in the general critique of Brown's character."
3,Looses narratives force,"The author is at his best when just narrating the history of John Brown and his times. When he delves into analysis and defending his thesis, he becomes pedantic, repetitive and boring. These portions read like an academic paper and detract from the very compelling facts presented. He should have studied how David Hackett Fisher puts together more readable history."
2,NOT a cheeseburger in paradise,I actually ordered this as a decorative item to go on a hat for a Jimmy Buffett concert. It looks nothing like the picture and is also much smaller than indicated.
3,"Very nice, but a bit impractical","I bought this bell for my sister after discussing how she needed a ""dinner bell"" like the one our mother had when we were kids. This looked ideal, but when only after I placed the order did I notice the $25 shipping cost. The high shipping is because this bell is *huge*. It's cast iron and well-made... and very heavy. It's pretty easy to put together, altho it looks like it was designed to have a wooden handle, which it does not come with. The only really bad thing about it is the mount. The bell can't sit on its own and can't be hung from above. The mount is a simple flange on the bottom designed to be screwed to the front of a flat surface with nothing above it, perhaps a post. [...]."
3,Made in China,The bell does ring as advertised but it was disappointing to find out it was made in China. The hole in the top of the bell was not centered so that when attached to the yoke the bell was crooked. Poor Chinese workmanship. I guess for the money it was reasonable. Make sure if you buy this bell that it has a centered hole in the top of the bell unless you don't mind a lopsided bell.
2,Hard to understand,"I just couldn't get this book. I was at the library, looking for a good book. ""Dive"" just seemed interesting on the back cover, so, I checked it out. The moment I read the first paragraph, I knew it was trouble. They had not explained the characters yet, they haven't even started with a person's name. Just ""I"" ""you"" ""they"" ""the"". Those are word that are really hard to understand when reading the first few chapters of a book. I checked it in, and got another book. Really hard to understand. Is it a sequal? The book didn't say. Then yet, even other sequal books I've read were easier to read. I do not recommend this book."
2,Brutal,"I agree with the first reviewer. This book is poorly put together. Some of the photo's look as if they were copied directly from an old grainy video. The questions asked during the cast interviews were a bit dumb, too. I bought this book new at the time it was released and ran across it while clearing out a spare room. I can't believe I kept it! I gave it two stars out of respect for the original cast (everyone before and including that wierdo George Lindsay) One more thing - the show became a drag after a few years because Andy was always pee'd off and agitated all the time."
5,Andy Griffith Scrapbook review,This book collects interviews with the cast and critiques of the episodes into an easy to read format. There are many good pictures along with the personal rememberings of our favorite citizens of Mayberry.
3,nightstand,Nightstand price is all it is worth. Top is more like wood particle and piece spray painted. Cherry color is a dark Cheryl. Item is okay for a kid's room.
4,A very good piece of Furniture but............,"The Louis Philippe nightstand is a very solid wood table with a great hidden drawer. There was no assembly required. It was the perfect size for me. The picture from Amazon and the printed dimensions were the main selling points for me. However the picture shows a very attractive dark wood and I have other cherry pieces that look the same as the picture but people should know that it's very red, especially on the top. It should have shown that in the table displayed. I still love it but would probably have looked further if I had known. I'm still going to go on enjoying it. Margaret Cook"
4,Very clean intro but a bit dated,"Very straightforward and gentle introduction to the Java threading mechanics.It features basic theory and examples for about 3/4 of the book with the rest of the pages dedicated to a few useful techniques to ease and streamline threads programming, which you can use in you applications or as inspiration and examples for your own devices. My only complaint is the presentation method: a bunch of code followed by a bunch of explanations. I think presenting the more relevant lines of code interleaved with explanations and then the whole example program would make learning much more effective and easy. This book is also starting to show its age, so until a second edition comes out I would recommend the O'Reilly book over this one, unless you can get it real cheap."
2,"clear introduction to threads, but a dubious hardcore manual","okay, maybe 2 stars is a little on the low side, but i have only otherwise seen the book given 5 stars, which in my opinion is a misrepresentation.plus points are clear writing and diagrams, going beyond re-explanation of thread API to include some useful patterns and plenty of lengthy examples if that's what you're after.minus points are not a lot on finest, trickiest points and some dodgy assertions when you get into those realms. 2 examples:1 - does not address lock-ordering in its ""deadlock avoidance"" section.2 - ""as a rough guideline, try to avoid calling Thread.yield() more than 5 times per second"" (in my view a bit outrageously woolly/unqualified).depends on what you're after."
4,Nice Performers,"I like the sound from these speakers, however you may want to look at the less expensive Polk offerings if you just want to have them serve to provide background music on your patio."
5,Oustanding Weather Proof Sound,"I've installed Polk speakers in every car I've owned and have always been pleased with their outstanding sound quality, but was a little doubtful that I'd get the same great sound in weatherproof speakers. After listening to these beauties on my deck over the last 2 months, I'm please to report that they sound outstanding. Fantastic bass, great detail and great stereo field no matter how loud, soft or distant. Also, these speakers sat unmounted on my deck railing thru showers and one horrific rain/thunderstorm and are no worse for the wear. If you're considering outdoor speakers, make sure you go with all weather or weather proof as opposed to weather resistant, and I highly recommend these Polk speakers in particular. (I bought them on Amazon for $150 for the pair, so check around the site for prices.)"
2,did not receive the pictured product,"I did receive a hair shaper, but I did not receive the product pictured. It snags on my thick hair and gave me many split ends. I tried it on my friend whose hair is thinner, and she had no problem with it. But this product was definitely not for me."
5,Great craft for girls sleepover,I bought this for my 10 year olds birthday sleepover and all the girls really enjoyed putting the glass tiles on the coaster. The grouting I did for them simply because we were running out of time and they wanted to watch their movie.
2,messy,"My 11 year old daughter loves to do crafts, I bought several craft kits to keep her busy. We actually did this kit as a family project. We all did one tile. The colors are limited to three so its hard to create really cool designs. I thought the coasters would be cement but they are a compressed material. The bag of mortar had exploded in the box so it was pretty messy. It would be nice if there were more glass tile colors to use in the kit, most of the pieces were bigger and hard to manage on a small tile, it would be nice if the glass pieces were more varied in size. My daughter needed help mixing the mortar to the right consistency. Over all fair product for the money"
1,"""God's Plan for Your Life"" as Robertson understands it","Robertson, using biblical anecdotes and quaint stories about his wealthy Republican friends in Virginia, attempts to explain the methods God uses to guide His people -- Robertson's run for the '88 Presidency is a frequent example. Laced throughout the book is a subtext: Republicans are good, Christian people of God; Democrats are responsible for the country's ""worst of times"" and inject America with a message of ""defeat -- division -- and despair."" Extremely conservative Christians will appreciate the simplicity of the book and will agree with his views; moderately conservative Christians will glide through the book w/o realizing the propaganda found therein; moderate and liberal Christians will be revolted at his attempt to pimp God for the Republican party. Robertson makes a person embarrassed to call him/herself a Christian."
2,Chill out?,"I don't like to say this, but some of the tunes on this album sound like they have come to the wrong cafe, if you know what I mean. You simply can't chill out to them. They are annoying, and chilly tunes are not supposed to be annoying. It's like ice bergs in freakin' Sahara - it's just not natural. I tried to get some sleep while listening to the album but I woke up several times when the volume suddenly was turned up a little. Annoying. But I'm not going to throw away this album just yet. Some of the songs on this so called 'chill out' album are good. They might not make you feel completely chilled out, but they are great as background music when you work. If you are looking for a real sweet album with relaxing chill out tunes, I recommend that you listen to a few other albums of the genre before you listen to this one. You might just find a better one."
1,Outdated information,"I did not check the copyright date (2000) before purchasing the book, which I hoped to use as a resource in a seniors internet class that I teach. Unfortunately, this means that this information is 5 years old. On the first two pages alone, only 2 out of 10 web addresses are still valid. Not worth the price. The links that DO still work are helpful, that is the only reason for the one star."
5,A very handy and helpful resource.,I use the book quite often to find high quality web sites. The index makes looking up specific topics quick and easy. I have found dozens of extremely helpful sites that I now visit on a regular basis. The travel and health sites have been particularly helpful. A great book for anybody hooked up to the internet.
3,Senior Citizen on the Internet,Some items were questionable for me as a senior - led only to buy something I maybe did not need. Other sites were OK for computer savvy people.
2,As long as you skip Evita & Che...,Philip Quast (Juan) was wonderful and his limited songs are now loaded for mobile listening.Matt Rawle (Che) makes me want to rip off my ears and feed them to the neighbor's dog. Elena Roger (Evita) is only *slightly* more tolerable.
5,wonderful cast! wonderful CD!,this evita CD is wonderful!!! I love it very much! it performed very well with my new Bose Speaker! the outlook of this CD is wonderful too~
3,Good but not Great,"This album is good, but it is not great.I love the voices and new interpretation of the songs, butI cannot say I love Eva Peron of this particular album. In my personalopinion, Madonna sings better for certain songs like 'New Argentina'It is a great album, but I would rather go for Madonna and Patti LuPone."
3,Patti LuPone owns!!!,"I gave this show three stars for one reason: nothing can outshine Patti LuPone flawless performance as Eva Perón! Don't get me wrong Elena Rogers delivers a heartfelt Eva but lacks the suprerior belt power of Ms. LuPone.Phillip Quast however is a brillant Juan Perón, basically anything with Mr. Quast in it is worth getting!!!Matt Rawle brings a very new and young Ché to the plate.... maybe not quite vocally powerful as Mandy Patinkin. He's okay but needs some getting used to.The new orchestrations and musical changes are different but I like the original much better....If you're already an Evita Fan and really enjoy the original recording then I would reccamend this, but if you haven't yet heard Evita then I'd say start with the Orginal Recording with Patti LuPone and Mandy Patinkin first."
4,almost as good as the 1978 broadway version,"I don't agree at all with the reviewer who thought this was a cheap rip-off. I would say if you want to get only one Evita version, get the original broadway cast from 1978, with Mandy Patinkin and Patti LuPone. But after listening to that one for the past 30 years, I wanted to try something slightly different. This one is very good, better than the original in some ways. This is the London 2006 cast. According to wikipedia, that version got good reviews but went out after a short run due to too many good musicals in London at the time."
3,This is a cast recording,Despite what other reviews have said this is a cast recording of the 2006 revival on London's West End.
1,A piece of junk,"I downloaded this album as an MP3 under the assumption that it was an original broadway or London (stage) recording. It was not, and the unnamed singers are terrible. The narator sound Russian, and the singer who plays Evita screams the songs - she has no voice. By calling themselved ""Original Cast Recording"" this group fools a lot of people thinking they are getting a broadway or London cast recording. Amazon contributes to this deception by listing them as ""Original Cast Recording"". Amazon should warn people that this is the name of the group, and not a actual original cast recording. This group has of number of other show recordings - BEWARE - do not waste you money on an inferior recording."
4,Very Nice,"I really enjoy all of the DVDs in the Jazz Master Class series, and this one featuring composer, arranger, and saxophonist Jimmy Heath is no exception. There's some of Jimmy's playing, some playing by students, and lots of great interaction with Jimmy and the students. Sound and picture quality are excellent."
2,Silver Tower,"enjoyable enough tosh....is it just me, or does the USS California morph from a 58,000 tonne battleship to an 11,000 tonne guided missle cruiser half way through??? mehh...."
5,Great quality!,It is a Christmas gift for my husband and I know he is going to love it! Very good quality.
1,Won't buy from this seller again,"Not only is their customer service terrible (if you can get a hold of someone), they're charging a $21 restocking fee. FOR A BAG. I don't see that warning mentioned on the shopping page. Bad deal."
3,"Good, just not great","Picked these up used. Initially I was impressed it seemed as though it had great build quality, small footprint and its MDF seemed more dense than other comparable models. Hooked them up as mains to a Denon 7.1 Channel Receiver. Eventually I had to move these to the rear, it just couldnt stand as Mains. Not audible at low volumes, At higher volumes, it seemed to distort, and even some of my Bookshelf Speakers (Klipsch SB-1 and Polk Audio Monitor 40) outperformed these towers. They sound good, but they just dont have the clarity and effortlessness that it takes to be the anchors of a living room home theater. The R30's are better suited in a stereo configuration in a Garage or Lounge room as a secondary setup."
1,Poor Product - Pads Leak,"Purchased Prevail 1st Quality Fluff Underpads 23"" x 36"" 15 Underpads (pack of 10) and they were really terrible pads. I used them as training pads for my Yorkshire Terrier Dogs and they leaked all over the floor. I also purchased the Prevail 30"" x 30"" Underpads at the same time and they worked great, no leaks."
5,great bed pads,"I buy these all the time for a stroke patient who is incontinent and I am pleased with the quality of the product, they do a fantastic job of keeping the bed dry and clean, in fact I order them on a subscription plan so I never run out. They are a nice size and are thick enough to do a great job."
3,advertising meant to mislead amount you are getting! But product is fine...,"product is fine. It did get lost at UPS and arrived late,Good communication with seller though.Misleading advertising... i would of just bought at local store for cheaper and no shipping fees. I thought I was getting bargain of the century, However, it turns out differently...They wrote Prevail Fluff Underpad - Printed Bag , Green, 23""x36"", 10 bags of 15 (150 ct.)THIS means you are only gettingONE BAG OF 15!! not 10 bags of 15."
4,Pee Pad for Dogs,"I use this as pee pads for my two small indoor dogs. I subscribe to this from Amazon.com because prices can't be beat; I buy a case (which comes in packs of 10 for a total of 150 pads/case) and have it shipped every other month for less than $30. I like this larger size, and when the dogs pee properly on it, I find these to be sturdy and absorbent and to be as good as or better than the pads you find at pet stores, Target, etc."
5,Great product,I use this for my mom who is incontinent and as puppy pads...works great for us in both instances...perfect size
5,Work great,These pads are thich and large. We use them for our dogs and since they are so much larger than the pet brand ones we use less and the cost is less. A double savings. I would recommend for both pet use and people. A good value for your money
2,Katz,These pads dont keep liquid bc always liquid go thru under pad.Before it was much stroger.I dont know why the company change product.I am not happy with this pads and hope they will briong back quality.Regards
4,New Packaging and Seemingly Improved,"I recently wrote a less than favorable review because for about two months, I received cases of these underpads that didn't seem to be of the same quality as before. I recently ordered cases and the packaging is different and the underpads themselves seem to be much better than before. The lining feels softer and thicker to me. They lay flat and they don't bunch up with tossing and turning."
5,Disposable bed pads,"This is an excellent product and an excellent value. Have been using this product, Prevail Fluff Underpads for approx. 3 years and am very satisfied."
3,Good but ABSOLUTE beginner's book!,"I can't really rate this book badly, but it is only useful if you have never picked up a sax before. We're talking BASIC. The redeeming feature is that you play snatches of popular tunes in the learning process rather than having to slog through ""Oh, Susanna!"" or ""Red River Valley."" It does lack an accompanying CD, which in my mind knocks it down a notch also. I would highly recommend trying to physically view the whole 4-book collection at the library or a music store to find the appropriate jumping in point on this series."
4,Interesting Reading,"I found a lot of good material in this book. I found some things that I had somehow missed, that I have incorporated in my playing. I recommend giving this book a try."
5,Really work!,"After 40+ bags of leaves last week, this product made it much quicker to bag the leaves compared to the effort needed for the last 10 years!"
3,limited use,"the pair I bought were very similar to this, and they worked fine when there are random but limited cleanup.. but for fall cleanup I used another product (see my reviews if you care) that avoids the need to rake piles then cleanup piles - which is actually where most of the work is. Also, with these , if you have a bigger cleanup then you are constantly raking then putting down the rake to put these on then the rake.. etc. etc.. I like it when I just keep raking .. and dont have to keep stopping and doing all this extra work. but ok for the light occaissional cleanup.."
5,Don't hesitate...grab them !,Simple and easy to use.One of the best value for money products you'll come across...saves you time and effort each time you use too !
3,A Bit Awkward,"The handle sticks out about 2"" from the side of the scoop. I have small hands. It was difficult to conform my hands and hold them back against the handles, just to hold onto the scoops. My scoops are rigid plastic. I think it would have been helpful if they were a bit more flexible and user friendly. I think you could take a plastic garbage can lid, cut some teeth on one side, and basically have the same thing."
2,Cheaply made and uncomfortable......,"My wife and I are tired of trying to scoop leaves up by hand, so I thought that maybe these scoops could help a lot. Upon arrival, it was obvious that not much effort went into making a quality product. The hand holds are small and have sharp edges that easily abrade the skin. Wearing some kind of gloves is an abolute must, but doing so will further exascerbate the difficulty that someone with large hands will have fitting into the hand hold slots. I definitely do not recommend this product. Sorry......"
4,An Irrisitable Impulse,"Delinsky has mystery,intrigue,and romance all in one. She makes you wish you could be a juror to watch the sexual tension and buddding romance blossom."
3,"Good heroine, unreal hero with issues","He ruined it for me. I dislike characters whom you have to peel like an onion to get through all the issues to the heart of the character. Good looking aside, personally I would have taken a pass at a guy like this who feels the need to play games all the times and be totally self centered and self serving. Even after peeling back the layers, you wonder whether this character could possible have a ""real"" happy ending. Didn't do it for me."
5,Another Great Author,I have read many of Barbara Delinsky's books and never been disappointed. I share my books with friends after I read them and they always comment on this Author. She is GREAT!
3,Awesome McFarlane,The nice Red jersey on Shaq is great and the way the ball connects to his elbow it looks so real
2,ASVAB BASICS,"I had compared reviews for the different ASVAB study guides to see which had the critcs. I have my GED, so when I tried for admission to the United States Navy, I had to make at least a 50% or above. I started studying this book about 3 weeks before the test, and I studied about 3 or 4 hours a day. I have a worst time in Math, so I spent most of my time on that subject. I went to take my test and my score came back a 43%. That was my second time taking the test. The first one was a 47%. The explainations for the questions after are more complicated. it was hard for me to understand what they were talking about, and where certain numbers had come from."
2,Not what the picture shows,The picture show that this is a Duel IDE cable. However what was received was a single IDE cable. The Duel cables are $10 more.
4,Great Introduction to the US Transportation System,"I use this book as a text in a university course. It gives a broad-brush approach to introducing the field of transportation and the various modes (planes, trains, trucks, boats). It looks at the field from both a user's and a provider's perspective and has great ""real-world"" examples and problems. It needs a little updating, especially regarding the regulatory environment which has changed significantly since this edition was published. I chose this book over 3 or 4 others because it is very readable and not too technical. A good introductory text."
5,Effective Approach to Reading Education,"Krashen advocates ""Free Voluntary Reading"" and provides quite of bit of evidence for its effectiveness. Great book for the power of choice for students and advancing student achievement for teachers."
5,The Best Book on Reading I've ever Read!,"This little book is a ""must-read"" for teachers and parents. Krashen reports on significant reasearch in reading and presents it in a very readable format. His conclusion is that if teachers or parents want to help their children's reading improve, we need to give them plenty of time to READ - not more workbook pages or exercises."
4,"Some dull spots, but mostly solid","College life is presented as being rather dull here, even with the dorms and some new faces. This makes some of the episodes drag on in a tiresome fashion.Otherwise, the hilarious Busy Phillips is a great addition as Pacey's girlfriend Audrey, while Jordan Bridges is very watchable and animated as Dawson's filmmaking partner Oliver. Jen doesn't do a whole lot this time besides spin records, hang out with Jack, and deal poorly with Dawson. And the Joey-and-Dawson show continues on its twisted way. There is a great episode, though, called ""Downtown Crossing,"" in which Joey is faced with a mugger who is then run over. It's quite emotional but not terribly sappy.Jack is the biggest disappointment here, shooting pool and drinking instead of studying. (In fact...when does anyone in this college ever study? And how do they do on their tests? This isn't addressed clearly.)This season is okay as a bridge to the next one, but it's just okay as a standalone."
3,The Woe Is Me Season.,"Dawson's Creek - The Complete Fifth Season is better than season six (the last season) but the show had already lost its luster at the end of season four. The gang have gone their separate ways but ultimately will all find their way back through the tragic death of Dawson's father. Joey is more independent as she starts College but she still finds a couple of losers to date, poor Joey. Dawson is pretty depressing this season, it's both a good and a bad thing. Pacey is the only character that totally does a 180. Ok season but season two is still my favorite."
3,Where is the Music?!?,"Seriously, the music was a huge part of what made alot of these scenes so special. I ran out to buy Kasey Chambers after I heard A Million Tears on 100 Light Years From Home....and now it's been replaced as have so many of the other great songs. (Jann Arden was nice for a while...but it's not the same as Paula Cole)Buy the discs....Season 5 was interesting in it's own weird 'what do we do with them now?' kind of way. But be prepared to groan when some upbeat guitar replaces a then still emerging Norah Jones as Dawson leaves the film critics house. It's just not the same."
1,"Yet again, this show failed me.","(Once again, a teenage girl on her darling daddy's account)First off, why in the world did they bring the gang to college? Did they learn nothing from Saved By The Bell?? Do people actually pay attention to chronology???Dawson-Literally gave up on films his first day on a set. Whiner.Joey-Had an affair with her proffessor then Jen's sleazy cheater boyfriend, Charlie.Jack-Who CARES anymore?!! (He's gay, and Jen's best friend...there's not alot of action there.)Jen-By far, the best character this season. Her affair with Charlie? Priceless. It was fun to see the used-to-be player get played.Audrey-God. She's sex-crazy, and a drunken loser, with an untimely past.Pacey-Woe to thee. His working on a boat, and going out with *cough* Audrey is ridiculous. (I'm laughing with hilarity, as I type.)Charlie-Hot player/hustler. Him and Jen. Good times...good times. CMM must like playing guys caughter between women.I just cannot believe how bad this actually is. A no-buy."
2,Not Dawsons Creek Anymore,"Now the show barely resembles what people fell in love with watching seasons 1, 2 and 3. Season 4 was all right as well, but the writing and character development showed signs of declining. It would have been better if dawsons creek had concluded then while it was still so good. By Season 5, the characters are so shallow and the plot is so trivial. It was as if everybody did a flip flop and acted the exact opposite of high school: Pacey became a rich stock broker, Joey was hooking up all over the place, Jenn was suddenly phony nice, Dawson was a slacker who moved back home. The only decent character was Audrey, who said what she was thinking and showed signs of being a real person. Save yourself the money- buy seasons 1-4 and the season finale, but dont bother with seasons 5 or 6."
3,"Paul Stupin, you're killing me!","I've heard it all before. It costs a lot of money to get credits for songs. But when I think I'm buying Season 5 of ""Dawson's Creek"" and what I really get is some whacked-out EDITED version of the show, I'm gonna be unhappy! This is the situation. I dealt with the theme song change. I dealt with some horrendous replacement songs. But I shouldn't have to deal with the decision to edit out some scenes for licensing issues. I hope I speak for many when I say that I am willing to pay top dollar for the unedited, as they aired versions of each and every episode of ""Dawson's Creek"". The DVDs as they are do not do the show justice. Only Season 1 is in its original state. It's the only set I suggest buying."
3,Dawson' Creek Fifth Season,"Like the Six Season, the show was loosing it audience. Too much of everybody doing mediocre stuff, because of the writer, Tom Kapinos and the constant concentration of zeroing the least talent of the entire cast, Katie Holmes."
3,Dawson's Creek - The 5th Season,"I was glad that it delivered fast, but unfortunately, it was kind of not in a good condition.. I don't want the box set to bend a little.. i wanna have a great condition, but too late. I am glad that i got it & love it"
4,Just what you would expect,"This is a good item to buy. It offers exactly what the descriptions say it does. Nothing about it is hidden and it is very enjoyable to watch. The special features are pretty good, although nothing outstanding. Overall i would recommend buying this product, it is a good buy"
1,IT DOESN'T WORTH TO WASTE YOUR MONEY,"This is the worst season, we have those tedious Audrey, Oliver and Todd, the ridiculous story with Joey and professor Wilder, or Joey with the mugger, Jack's wild life... Fourth season wasn't one of the best either but at least the dvd had some extras. We don't know if Season Five dvd includes any bonus material (I think the answer is going to be: NONE), but we do know that SOME SCENES ARE GONNA BE CUT!!!! (Katie's, when she sings with the band). So, it's not only that they're not giving, but they're also taking. Not to mention that they're changing the songs once again.So, here's my advice: Unless you're a real fan of DC and wants to own all the seasons, don't buy this, and neither sixth season, unless it may bring some good extras.I recommend to buy 1-4 seasons, and the series finale."
2,Yikes...,"A Craptacular Season. The worst, in my opinion. Didn't even bother to watch past a few episodes when they first came out. Now that I have finally watched most of them on tbs...I have to say that the writers didn't know what to do with the show at this point, and it showed. I agree with most of these reviews, that in this season, they basically ignored character development from previous seasons, and also seemed to ignore the fact that Pacey and Joey had a relationship at all. You can't ignore significant events, and significant developments of characters personalitys. Well, you can...but what comes out of that is bad tv. I will never spend my money on season 5. I am awaiting season six, because at least it started to improve around the middle of the season."
4,Why,"I LOVE the show, however I just got season 5 and feel ripped off. Why, well for 1 reason. Not the music that's due to money and contract issues. This is that there are NO EXTRA'S. Come on people. 1-4 has something, but this had nothing. A commentary on a few shows (granted I think there are lame but still)at least it's something. Anything at all would be nice but we fork out the $$$ for what NOTHING. I'd have taped them off tv that way I'd have it all. Hell if I knew it was just the shows I wouldn't have done it.I just pray and hope (granted I'm sure it'll be the same as season 5) that season 6 has something. Let me know if you guys/gals agree!!!"
1,When Will It End?,"So now we're not only losing the original music, but much loved scenes as well? Is there any effort going into these DVDs at all? My favourite scene in this season - the one where Jen is debating going on a trip to Costa Rica with Jack or to spend the summer with her parents - was completely ruined by a change in music. The original, ""Teenage Wasteland"" by the Who, was switched out for an upbeat song that did not convey the mood of the scene at all. Yes she was dancing on a chair, but Jen was dealing with angst over a dilemma, not having a pajama party! Then of course the scene where Joey's singing with Charlie's band. Again we can see that the studios just do not care that they're butchering a much loved show. I understand it can be expensive to gain the rights to music, but if it can be done for other shows then why not this one? There is little to no difference in cost between these DVDs and those for other shows. This is just disappointing."
3,Too much irrelivant information,"I have mixed feelings with this book. It covers a lot of information, which is good, but i often get lost because there aren't enough pictures to go along with the explanations. Also, many techniques are software specific, and many step-by-step tutorials involve software that you may not have. Many questions that i have are left unanswered... but then again no book can answer everyone's questions. If it did, it would be 20,000 pages! The character setup section mainly deals with Hash's Animation:Master. Little good that does people who use more industry standard software like MAX or Softimage. A related book that i recommend is George Maestri's Digital Character Animation... it covers much of the same material, is much easier to read, and actually IS software independant!"
3,Too many applications attempted; spread too thin,"Overall this was a very helpful book. My main ""problem"" with this book is the author's attempt to cover so many applications so specifically. As a Lightwave user, I am still left in the dark about Lightwave's bones in character animation; which is one of the main reasons I purchased the book. Only the very basic setup was covered as a tutorial. How about something more complex such as a ""hand"" with limited ranges, fall-offs and strengths...? The version 5.0 and 5.6 is jumped between frequently...then Hash...then Softimage.....Max.... For character animation theory this is a good book but if you are trying to actually be a character animator using only one of the apps (such as Lightwave), then I suggest doing alot more reading from other books and web tutorials. For the price this book is good but no great wonder. I did learn from it; only not as much as I thought I would have when I bought it."
1,Piece of crap--get something certified,"Maddeningly, this thing worked intermittently, but its driver was a ROYAL pain to install on my XP box and seemed to disappear after a couple reboots. I also lost my wireless keyboard and mouse twice (on a separate USB jack, mind you), and I repeatedly and randomly lost my motherboard. As in I couldn't even get to BIOS. And I finally got fed up and ripped this thing out and threw it in the trash. The telltale moment is probably when Windows bonks you with a message and says this isn't ceritified hardware and strongly recommends not installing it. Good advice I wish I'd taken."
5,I Knew Mrs. Mary Reed Newland,"I know the religious writings of Mrs. Mary Reed Newland. More importantly, however, I was privileged to know her, and I graduated in 1964 from Monson (Massachusetts) High School with two of her sons, James and John. Mrs. Newland writes with keen insight and with unfailing grace; quite simply, she wrote the way she lived. Any Catholic, any Christian--indeed any person--will benefit intellectually as well as, more critically, spiritually from the work of this wonderful woman. If you enjoy the works of the late Archbishop Fulton J. Sheen, you will similarly enjoy (and greatly benefit from) Mrs. Newland's work. It is at once practical and spiritual, academic and accessible. I simply can't recommend her works highly enough!"
5,Nice Little Speaker,"To begin, this speaker did not blow me away the second I hooked it up or anything. But it does put out nice warm sound you would expect from polk. It was definitely worth the money. Polks sound nice with Onkyo receivers (I dont know why, they just do). I highly recommend these to any non-audiophilic person out there who still enjoys good clean sound from a small cabinet that wont hinder your rooms aethetics."
4,Great speakers for price and size!,"I hooked these up to a 5.1 Dolby Didgital sound system as the front left and right speakers. They are the right size and sound for what I was looking for. They are good looking and versital. I will mount them to the wall for maximum effect. For this price you cannot go wrong, not only is it a great name speaker, it performs well too."
2,Sux-tion cups,it just fell from the window where it was suctioned and shattered between my feet after 3 short days. Oh well.
1,Not optically correct,This mirror is advertised as optically correct but it is NOT. There is considerable distortion around the edges which is clearly evident when it is held at at arm's length. I have another mirror of the exact same size and shape sold by Zadro which is optically correct and has no discernable distortion. I noticed the Tweezerman is made in China. Maybe they used to be better. A lot of stuff from China looks just like the original product with a quick superficial inspection but often the quality materials and workmanship are not there.
1,Optically Poor,"Annoying to use. I've had much better. Thought Tweezerman would be the best, but it has a VERY small area of focus."
1,Fooled by this mirror's size! Very disappointed!,"I just read a few negative reviews about this product and the ordering process and I agree with those customers disappointment. I can't say for sure but I feel that I was somehow fooled somehow by the ordering process of this mirror. I've previously owned a few magnifying mirrors of various sizes and truly believe that I ordered a 6"" diameter mirror, not a 3 3/8"" diameter. I know that I absolutely did not want a mirror this size. These small ones are sold all over the internet for 1/3 the price I paid and do not serve my needs. It seems that the product description was changed after I ordered it. I just don't know. I've never had a problem over many years of ordering from Amazon VERY DISAPPOINTED!!!!"
3,Tweezerman 10X Magnifying Mirror w/Suction Cups,"Nowhere in the advertising of the product was the actual size of the mirror displayed. I did not notice this until it arrived; I assumed that it was a decent size. However, I was disappointed to see that the mirror is only 3 3/8 diameter, which makes it very difficult to see even half of my face at one time, and I feel a bit cheated. The reason I ordered this mirror was because I had just broken my large magnifying mirror that was at least 6 inches in diameter. But it's my own fault for not specifying size or at least inquiring about the size before purchasing.Also, it is not a 10X magnification as advertised, it is actually 12X.This is the first time I am not totally satisfied with an Amazon product.Sincerely,Merry Mom"
3,too small,The magnification may be 12X but its not much use on a mirror with a diameter of just 4 inches. The entire purpose is defeated since you have to hold the mirror at some distance to get the magnification effect. the product description should mention the size of the mirror as well. Its about as useful as a 5X mirror with a larger diameter.
1,Size problem,"This might be a fine product as far as mirror quality goes, however, it is way too small to be of any practical use. I'm sorry I purchased it."
5,Tweezerman can't hold a candle to Aero Tweeze!,"As an aesthetician I can give my wholehearted approval to these tweezers. I've tried Mehaz, Tweezerman, Toolworx, and just about every German-made tweezers out there and these are far and away the best. Take good care of them with the enclosed case and they will take good care of you ;)"
4,Fascinating!,"It would be a good idea to plan on reading this book at a time when you have little or no distractions. I found myself having to re-read a paragraph or even a page if I was interrupted, but I am sure you will find this book as fascinating as I did. See my website for full review."
1,Parroting postmodernism,"""Parrot"" is a soliloquy of incomprehensible, postmodern drivel. The positive reviews must have been written by parrots. Sure, the pictures are fine, but that's about it. If you want real information on the cultural significance of parrots, please read ""Parrot Culture"" by Bruce Thomas Boehrer. Richard Verdi's exhibition catalogue ""The Parrot in Art"" is a good complement to Boehrer's book.Forget about this one. :-("
2,shoulder pads,They scratch where velcro is attached. Hard to get it just right so doesn't scratch. Am not using them.
5,Tracy Byrd - fantastic,"This was the first Tracy Byrd CD I purchased from Amazon - Six others followed.I love his voice - I love his band - the lyrics are terrific - I never get tired of listening to his music. I cannot imagine why he is no longer recording (I hope I amwrong) He has, in my opinion, every other country singer beat!"
3,Rough Guide to Tanzania,"This is just an ""ok"" CD. I tried to use this as background music in my classroom, but the music isn't consistent from song to song, which totally throws me and my student off. There's one song with a ""hip-hop"" beat, which I suppose is what you get from a larger city in Tanzania, but it's not exactly what I was looking for. The songs are ok, some are even quite enjoyable but the entire CD just wasn't doing it for me."
4,Germany's Past Century in the Foem of Short Stories,"If you don't know German history, you probably won't enjoy this book. However if you do know the history of twentieth century Germany this book is worth the read. Some chapters are better than others. I guess it depends on one's interests. The chapter 1912 describes a young naval officer on a torpedo boot who describes the U-boots he sees. Is this officer Grand Admiral Karl Doenitz? It certainly is later in 1981. For myself, 1914-1918 were the best. They describe a conversation between Ernst Juenger and Erich Maria Remarque. Two famous German authors each with their own individual perspectives on the great war. Absolutely fascinating! Bottom line its an interesting book."
3,"OK, but loses steam after 1950","I was looking forward to this, but have to say that I was mildly disappointed. Grass's use of short vignettes for each year is interesting--reminds me of Studs Terkel in a way--but one has to have a good grasp of German history to get all of the allusions. The WWI sequence was disappointing--Grass's imaginary discussion between Juenger and Remarque relies more on shallow characterizations of both authors, including using quotes from their works as part of the narrative. I was hoping for something a little more meaty, though he gets credit for trying. The years up to WWII are very good, but once the war is over, the book loses its immediacy. This is most likely the fault of the year-by-year format he uses, but even so, I found the rest of the work to be OK. OK book if you are a Grass fan."
4,Good Read,Had to get book for class. Book was a good read. A conspiracy novel. i recommend and i am hard person to please.
1,i burned this when i was done,"i had to read this book for a class at college and coiuld hardly make my way through it. the plot is difficult to follow, every page is a tedious, monotonous chore to work through. i could not relate to the characters at all, as they were either complete cowards or operated on motives entirely beyond my means to grasp. I have never read a worse book in my life. i burned it page by page in the fire after the class was over for the sheer pleasure of watching this wretched, miserable waste of time die slowly."
5,A revealing story,"Centered on the pre-Independence Kenyan struggle between the Mau Mau liberation fighters and the British colonial government, A GRAIN OF WHEAT gives a portrayal of the struggle that few writers have ever depicted. One gets a good picture of the Mau Mau fighters, the attitude of the Colonialists, their the detention camps, the nature of the war, the bloody encounters, the ruthlessness of some of the soldiers of Colonial army and the direction to independence for the African continent. Betrayal, hopes and dreams, horrors and loss are all parts of the story.A particularly amazing thing about this story is that like in Triple Agent Double Cross, we learn that the tragic nature of this story reveals the futility of conflicts which in the end produces no winners, because humanity loses when the majority of the people emerge from a war scarred for life, having lost the innocence that epitomizes the freedom of the soul."
1,Don't waste your money on this,"I bought this as a basic bell to warn pedestrians of my approach. Even at a cheap price, I thought I couldn't go wrong with Zefal quality; boy, was I wrong!As others have written here, the fundamental flaw is that the striker arm is made of plastic, with no spring. Function of the bell depends on this plastic's springiness, which quickly vanishes. Mine lasted less than 10 rides before becoming completely unusable.Get a proper bell that includes a metal spring as part of the striker mechanism!"
2,"its ok, not great","My problem with the charger is the little plastic grips that hold the phone, within a month mine got bent and it was difficult to put the phone on. Maybe I torqued it too much when I removed the phone each time. Just a design flaw but one that makes it unusable or difficult to use."
3,Does not come with AC Adapter/Plug,"Just received this charger today in the mail. What...Ericsson did not make clear in their product description is that the desktop charger does not come with its own AC adpater which means that you need to use the travel charger that comes with your T28 phone. Although it is no big deal, it nevertheless is annoying to find out that you cannot leave the desktop charger at home and the travel charger at work!!!"
1,They ship the wrong cable,"They ship a cable that doesn't match the picture. No thumbscrews, it has the same falt pin connector on both sides. (like on the printer) It won't plug into any computer I have ever seen.Then JR& Music World (the shipper gives you a run-around on the return. Very bad experience."
2,Incomplete if you have no previous knowledge of SD history,"I don't know anything about San Diego history and have never read any other books on the subject. While reading this book, I was constantly asking myself ""why?"" and having to look up more complete explanations. I understand that this is meant to be a concise history, but for the uninitiated, there were too many holes for me to use this book without the aid of the internet and other sources. I almost felt as if I I were reading an elaborate Table of Contents... for an essay written by an undergraduate. This last part is personal preference and is just to say that I didn't care for her writing style, finding it quite dry."
3,Plugs should be permanently fastened to cord,"These are comfortable effective earplugs. Unfortunately they can come off the cord with enough of a tug ( at least the pair I have ). Why can't a line of earplugs be consistently removable or non-removable from the cord, and why can't this be indicated on the packaging? WHYWHYWHY!"
3,"A favorite author as a child, but not one of her best","This, like all of Marguerite Vance's novels is beautifully illustrated with black and white drawings.Mother Mary Alphonsa was Rose Hawthorne Lathrop. She and her husband converted to Roman Catholicism. She founded a hospital providing free care for cancer victims. After being widowed, she became a nun, founding a Dominican Order.This was not one of my favorites, but admittedly that is probably because the religious aspects went somewhat over my head. From the book, I really didn't understand the extent of her accomplishments. Having read more about them, I would probably be interested in an adult biography. I think that Catholic families would probably enjoy this more."
2,Not really what I was looking for,"I bought this book with the hope that it would give me truck loads of information on clowning/costume/makeup. As it turns out, it's really just a book of skits. It's not that they weren't funny, but it took alot of the fun out of it. Maybe I had too high of hopes for a clowning book, but I'll be returning this one."
5,More than you want to know,This book is very well written and detailed and will tell you more than you ever wanted to know about any aspect of human sexuality. I have to read it for a college class- no options- but my teenagers are also peeking at it because it is factual and informative. Overall a good quality book.
3,IT'S HIS TURN NOW,"You probably knew before listening that this would not be an unbiased view. Hearing that he sometimes felt like a ""pinata"" reinforces this opinion. Well, everyone's entitled to have their say and so this is Ari Fleischer's take and now it's his turn.Whether one agrees with his views or not, Fleischer served as the White House press secretary during some of our country's most momentous days, from 9/11, the prelude to the war in Iraq, and more.The author/reader has no love for the press and reiterates what he feels are some of their more frigid exchanges. He has high praise for his former boss, Mr. Bush, extolling his leadership abilities. No surprises here.While not a seasoned actor (some may take issue with that), he gives a straightforward, listenable reading of his story. Condemn him or praise him, his story is sure to be fodder for debate, diatribe, and discussion.- Gail Cooke"
2,Bad book!,"This book is bad! To make it clear, the author seems to be an expert in the field, so the results are stated correctly, but not in a correct way. Definition followed by theorems, then by proofs, then by exercises. No explaination, no motivation, no flow, no organism, makes a beautiful subject so painful to proceed.On the positive side, the book has good scope and depth for an introductory text, along with a descent set of exercises. That makes some value as a reference book. But if you want to learn algebraic number theory, stay away from this book."
4,Finally more about Gilthanas and Silvara!,"I've been looking forward to reading about these characters for years! Douglas Niles, Steve Miller, and Stan! have delivered in spades, even if I wish there had been more of Silvara. (The one story withher that was included was excellent, however, and made her appearance in ""The Day of the Tempest"" make a lot more sense.) Other stories I liked were the one in Kalaman, the one with Linsha Majere (I've been wanting to know more about her ever since I read ""Citadel of Light""), and the one set in Missing City. The main character of that one was delightfully creepy. The source sections about the locations Gilthanas visited during his search for Silvara are also excellent and I think they should be interesting whether one plays roleplaying games or not. I think both gamers and readers will like this book equally well. (Oh, and the card game included in the back is a lot of fun.)"
3,I liked it... and I recommend it.,"I think the first problem is that many seem to be reading this book like it was a novel. It isn't. It's a collection of short stories that share the thread of Gilthanas' quest to first get home to Qualinesti and later find Silvara. I clued into this after the third story/chapter. I think it was a huge mistake that TSR called it a ""novella"" on the back cover copy. That aside, I think Doug Niles, Steve Miller, and Stan! (weird name that last one) did a great job of giving us insight into the ""new"" Dragonlance world of the Fifth Age. I also really liked the Knights of Solamnia characters that appeared in the book and how we got to see how they view the world now that that gods are gone. I give the book Three Stars only because I wish there had been more about Silvara in it, eventhough the story in whcih she appears is one of my favorites."
3,Good...but not good enough!,"This book was somewhat of a disappointment. The ending of this book was rather abrupt and not satisfactory. I was expecting more of a novel (or at least a novella). Disjointed as it was, I found the story line easy to follow. However, I did not get a sense of closure to the story. It was definitely open-ended enough to encourage a game of D&D, but it did nothing to sate any desire for further understanding of this story. I do hope another novel (or novella) is being written as a sequel to this.The book was well-written, but I would not recommend it to someone who is expecting a novel of Gilthanis' journey to find Silvara. I feel I learned nothing. Gilthanis is still in the same situation as before..."
3,Well Written... But Misleading,"Gilthanas is one of my favorite characters and I loved the idea that we'd finally get to read a novel about his adventures..... Too bad it isn't a NOVEL. What it is a collection of short stories with a Gilthanas theme to them. I am not much of a fan of a short stories (I read too quickly to enjoy them), but these tales were well written for the most part, even though they don't appear to be in any particular order.The novel also has a fairly large supplement of reference material for a card game in the back. I would definatly be interested if these folks wrote a traditional novel with a Gilthanas theme, but this collection of short stories was too disjointed for me to fully enjoy."
2,It was okay if you're desperate,"I really didn't like it that well. It was entertaining and all, but not the best. I would suggest reading something else before this. The one good thing I can say about the book is that it filled a lot of history in."
2,THIS BOOK MAKES ME SICK!!,"I am sorry to say, but this book makes me sick!! I was awaiting the arrival of Silvara towards the end of the book. And what Happens!!?? They leave a clifhanger!! Margaret Weis and Tracy Hickman, if you are out there, please start making ALL of the books. You guys are the masters of Dragonlance. And for the guys who made this book, you need to think of a part 2 to this book!!"
2,"Well written, bad plot...","Alright, seeing as how I'm a reader that sympathizes with the characters this book is one I would love to ban and wish I never read. I mean, dont get me wrong, it was well written but... If your a true Gilthanas fan or a true DragonLance fan then you may find this book a bit disappointing. Gilthanas, yes, made the mistake of giving up on Silvara which was a punishment all in itself but what happens in his journeys is just plain torture. Im a romantic so I highly believe in love and all that good stuff. This book just took it too far and I know that Gilthanas was just a character in a book but imagine what happens to him happens to you. In my opinion it was a bad book, you might have a different opinion though. Just let me warn you, if you like Gilthanas then do not read this book."
2,It was not as good as i hoped,I could not wait to read this book but when i got it i was very disappointing. They tried to combine the card game and the book and it just took all the entermaint out of it. And even worse then the whole card game thing is the ending of this book. It just left you with a empty filling. I would not reomend this book to anyone. But i do hope they wright another book about Gilthanas becouse i am a big fan of his.
1,Dragonlance novels are slipping...,"It has been about one year since I have picked up a Dragonlance novel, the last being ""Dragons of Summer Flame."" I used to be a huge fan of this series, but I slipped. After reading this novel, I don't think I could have made a better choice. I saw this book and thought that this would be an interesting story, I always wondered what happened to Gilthanas after the chronicles, so I picked it up. The authors of this novel apparently didn't care what kind of story they brought out, as long as their deadline was met. Come on, if you can't write something that meets the standards of the past, don't drop them for money! This book was boring, never really focused on a plot, and basically drawn out. I am in awe how the Chronicles and Legends series kept me in suspense, even at 1,000 pages, but this book had me sleeping by page 30! Keep the standard, or don't write. It's that simple. Don't read this book."
3,Gilthanas,This was a pretty boring story of Gilthanas. I don't recommend it to you unless you like his character.
2,2 Stars ONLY for the good stories,I do NOT recomend this book to ANYONE. Gil and Silvara never found eachother and it ends with them both unhappy and apart still. Spoiler yes but I sure hope there will be a second part to this book. That will end it one way or the other atleast...feel very let down by this book.
1,NOT EVERYTHING THAT GLITTERS IS GOLD!,"I thought this glitter would be gold like it's described, but it isn't. It looks more like a yellow orange to me. It's also very bitter so you can't use a lot of it. I was very disappointed!"
3,"Fun fantasy, and--well, why not?","I'm not certain that I take dreams very seriously, but Buckland has Rom ancestry and if this is his family's tradition regarding dream interpretation... well, why not have fun with it? This text is not presented as a deeply academic work, and if you enjoy dream books, this one is at least as good as--and perhaps better than--most in print today. I like Buckland's writing style, and this book is fairly easy to use. (And, yes, I have Traveler ancestry myself.)"
1,Zero Stars Not available,Zero another Zero How many of these fantasy books are you going to keep putting out there? Oh yeah I forgot this is America and you can suck as much money out of people who are looking for some magic in their lives as they are willing to spend. Shucks! Another book of immaturity and childish foolishness. These books should have specific classification of stupidity written on them. BTW all you poor people looking for one of these books can check them out of some libraries for free.
1,wanders all over the place!,"If you want to read about politics, but a book on politics. If you want tread about hidden cities/ mound builders buy another book. Too much political wandering throught the 1700's and 1800's and too little about hidden cities."
1,Would not purchase this brand again,"The monitor, with VG2230wm clearly stamped onto it, does not correspond with any owner manual I've been able to find for the model it is supposed to be. I am helpless to make any settings changes, even though I installed the software...there simply is no way to do it without a manual. There is a very annoying ""screen resolution"" window that pops up every time the focus comes to this monitor. The window says press 1 or press 2 to deactivate the notice and the manual refers to the numbered buttons on the front of the screen...there are no buttons on the front of the screen. If there were a solution to this annoying interference, I might feel differently. As it is, I will no doubt be looking to dump it in the very near future. Never again will ViewSonic be my choice."
2,dead pixels,"This monitor was great. But, 4 months of ownership and the dead pixels are starting. Had to swap out the monitor because our designer couldn't use with the dead pixels. 4 months, give me a break!"
4,Umberto B.B Neto,"I liked a lot of the monitor, mostly for already own built-in boxes acousticses. It owns good screen inclination with height adjustment, what facilitates a lot. Still owns rotative action about the base what is very interesting. To be excellent just would need of other entredas of video. I finally liked and I am satisfied."
4,Pretty Close To Fabulous,"Amazon delivered this in only two days, even though they told me it would take a week to ship. Used XP drivers only. When I first hooked it up, it had an extreme ""washed-out"" look. No amount of tweaking the brightness/contrast controls could fix it. Then I looked at my graphics card control panel. Somehow the card color corrections had gotten turned off. A quick click, and it was fixed. Now it looks FABULOUS, and no dead pixels! The stand is well-designed and not tippy. Supplied cables are very short. Buttons on the side are a pain but how often do you mess with those? Note: This replaced my 3-year old Viewsonic. The speakers on the old Viewsonic were good enough for occasional music listening. I read the other reviews and I was prepared for bad speakers, but they are REALLY, REALLY BAD. Other than that, I think this monitor is quite lovely, and a good bargain. Amazon service is hard to beat, keep it up!"
3,a short play illustrative of another time,"""The Treasure"" by David Pinski is a short play about a Jewish family in (presumably) nineteenth century Europe. It is standard fare, and there is nothing particularly clever or insightful about the story. The story revolves around humanity's greed and poor treatment of fellow humans. One bright spot is the character Tillie, who is quite a clever girl, surrounded by mediocrity and aiming to break free from the mire of the traditions of the past."
4,Heavy,Good history book with lots of pictures and information. Heavy to carry around to classes though!
1,Pure Junk,"So, I got this product and I was sent the wrong one actually at first, took care of that, and then 3 weeks later it breaks. It's junk, I got this for my wife who still uses film cameras, and it was a complete waste of money... find another camera, not this one"
2,I gut the cable but where can I find the software ?????????,I gut the cable but where can I find the software to update my phone I did not find it on ericsson web site .... Please help
4,At this price ??,I saw this film in a theatre and surfed to see if it's available online. I'd love to own it - BUT NOT AT THIS PRICE.
2,Book is bland...and run of the mill,This is the same old story told over and over again about women who pick the wrong men. What about a book about women who pick the right men?
5,Laugh-out-loud funny,"This book is truly hysterical. I read it in a few days and could not stop laughing, even on the metro, in the gym, etc. It is especially funny for those of us who grew up and/or live in the DC metro area, and can picture the bars and restaurants used as settings in the book. I met Patrick Sanchez at one of his readings and he is as witty and humorous as his characters.If you want a classic, read Hamlet. If you want to laugh, pick up Girlfriends!"
2,Male author knows a little about women,"I read this book for my book club and we all agreed that the book was all over the place. Lots of characters to follow and all of the drama that comes with each. We were quite surprised that a man would take such a ""Sex in the City"" approach to this book, but it was ok. Read this if you want to laugh at some silly things we do as women."
4,The Pan,It was what I expected. It's nice and big and easy to wash when you burn something on it. Wish they weren't as expensive but worth the money.
3,Tags attached with GORILLA GLUE or what?,"I was so excited to open the box with these new shiny pans; however, my happy feelings didn't last long when I removed the paper attached to the inside of the pan with some sort of sticky glue. It's impossible to get the gummy residue off of the pans. So, now my nice new shiny pans are already scratched (light surface scratches from using a sponge with a scrubber on one side)..... and the gummy stuff is STILL THERE! And now the gummy stuff has nice bits of blue sponge stuck in it. I may never get to actually use the pans. ARRGH."
3,pretty good,"this is a pretty good jelly roll pan, does not warp (at least not yet), but after you wash them, the lip gets rusty! since i always use a silpat, i'm not too worried about it, but it's pretty gross finding rust puddles. if i had known, i probably would not have gotten these, but all in all, it serves the purpose.also, i was a little disappointed in the shipment, it was not wrapped up prior to shipment, so it got pretty dented. again, i use a silpat, so the dents don't affect me too much, but i was just hoping for better packaging."
3,nice if they weren't dented,"I've been wanting some good quality aluminum bake ware. These are exactly what I wanted with one exception. They arrived looking like someone had hit them with a hammer, one in one place the other in 4 places. There is a good chance Amazon would've replaced them had I not chose NOT to pursue the issue. They are still usable"
4,nice but it dents easily,"I like the pan, it cleans well and it does a good job in the oven as well, however I have found that it dents way too easily. I guess that is what you get with aluminum, however I wish it was maybe little thicker to prevents easy dinging. Heavy gauge is misleading as it should be more like medium gauge IMHO."
1,Out dated by other newer books,I bought the top 5 options books from Amazon and returned 3 of the 5. I kept Fontanills and McMillan as the combination of the two books enabled me to grasp all I needed to know.This books falls short for telling the practical application of how to get started. Wasted too much time on unecessary tuition.If you are going to buy one book on options this is not it:1.If you are a beginner buy Michael C. Thomsett. 2.If you want a practical how to get started and make money in options guide then buy Fontanills 3.If you want all the math and theory buy McMillan's Strategic.Pass on this book.Daniel
3,true does not mean entertaining,"Basically Mr. Ham talking to the camera, straight head and shoulders shot. The dvd packaging makes you think the video is equally interesting. I watch History documentaries and this completely bored me. My nine year old watched a few seconds of it with me and said do I have to watch this too. I watched a good amount of it it hoping it would improve but it is very dry. All three stars are for the content being true. I am glad to support a passionate Christian organization. I just wish it was better."
2,An Inaccessible Read,"Written in 2002, this book is still considered the gold standard in web accessibility. I have no idea why. What Joe Clark has accomplished here is to spread about 20 pages of good accessibility information across a 400 page miasma. Most web designers don't care about the history of captioning and transcription systems--we just want the facts, man. What should we do, and what should we avoid. Best practices. Etc. That info is in here, but you have to cut a swath through the verbosity to find much of it. Or just read the last page of each chapter, which summarizes the previous 40-odd pages in six or less sentences. Save yourself the price of the book and scan through the entire text of the book online. In the end, Building Accessible Websites is an inaccessible read."
2,I an now blind.,"The information in to book is okay, but the little font really hurt my eyes. It felt like parts of me were being stretched to their limits; parts that just simply were not meant to be stretched. The book was pretty good though. A little dry for my taste. Oh, and if you look closely at the cover art, you can see a goat!"
3,"Tiny, tiny font","This book has some wonderful information. However, I find it ironic how this book discusses accessibility and the book itself is not accessible! It is written in tiny, tiny font. I had to use a maginifying glass to read it! After struggling through a few chapters, I moved on to another book, Maximum Accessibility, with much larger font."
1,Does he know he is a jerk?,From the first line of the book it is obvious Joe Clark holds all other human beings in contempt and feels like his reader are idiots wasting his time.
4,A Useful Perspective,"In this book, Clark presents a lot of advice to help authors in creating accessible websites. Each chapter gives advice (albeit very opinionated) on how to design accessibility into a page. Because this is done outside the pale of established accessibility standards, this is not a book to read if you want to learn the standards. However, this perspective does emphasize that accessibility is much more than just meeting a few checklists on a Section 508 or W3C WCAG form.Clark's writing is engaging and colourful; that having been said, if you tend to appreciate dispassionate books, this is not a book for you."
4,Great chair at a great price.,"This is an excellent chair - very heavy weight, rock solid, feels like it will last a long time. Assembly is a bit of an adventure due to the poor directions but once you get past that you've got a chair to last years.Only reason for the 4 stars is that the chair is awkwardly wide - much wider than the armless version of the chair and frankly much wider than it needs to be."
1,look out,"What a worthless book. The illustrations are homemade, hand-drawn scribble. Read the ""key""ed facts in BRS or get Robbins Review if you need help solidifying the pathology. I'll bet it was the authors who posted these bogus ""5 star"" reviews immediately after the book was published. The reviews sound identical, they're all from the same place in TX, and they over-enthusiastically give themselves 5 stars. It's wholly overpriced... be cautious."
2,Not so good...,"I have to admit that I still can remember a few plates from this book when I was at Pathology course, but not the rest of it. Visual Mnemonics for Pharmacology is great!, but this book is not. Just use BRS Pathology and that is it! Don't spend money in this."
2,"lots of good concepts, no substance","The book is laid out clearly and has some useful concepts. It covers everything from creating job descriptions, hiring the correct individuals and promoting growth and development within organizations.I bought the book because I was interested in the chapters on individual motivators and team building but there wasn't really enough substance or examples to be useful to me. It could be a good introductory text if you are unfamiliar with current HR methods."
1,Worst bike every,"I bought the bike for my sister-in-law, and I bought the men's for myself. She rode it 2 times, and the 2nd time the back brake completly fell off and broke!!! Both the men's and women's bikes where making loud noises. I rode mine 1 time and decided to return it for a better one. So if you decide to buy these bikes, be careful you do not get hurt on it."
2,Expected 2 got 1,"As in the previous review, I too expected 2 heat shields. Now I need to order another one and it's going to cost $5.00 more for shipping. I too would not have ordered this product if I had known they didn't come as a pair."
3,Cobra Universal Heat Shields,As far as the product is concerned I was very happy with the product. The quality of the item is very good and fits my exhaust well.My complaint is the item was described as Heat Shields(PLURAL) This led me to believe I was buying two Heat shields and I was dissapointed when I opened the package and only found one SHIELD. So I think they should title there Item as Cobra Universal Heat Shield Not Shields.Had I known that I was only purchasing one item I would not have bought it.
4,sturdy pan,"This is a nice sturdy pan made of all stainless- thankfully no non-stick surface. I love is so far, but lately it does seem to do a little twisting and boinging in the oven when I baked cookies last. I do like it, though"
4,Ordered two and they were different,"I ordered two Norpro 12"" X 16"" stainless cookie sheets for my wife.Both came marked 12"" X 16"" and both were from Norpro (and both from China).One was 12"" X 16"" at it's ""outside"" dimensions and quite thin.The other was labeled ""Professional"" and was thicker and the BAKING SURFACE was 12"" X 16"".The ""Professional"" one seems to be far better than the other one (that had some small dents in it).Both had labels that left glue on the cookie sheets, but Goo Gone took care of it easily!"
2,not very good,"These pans really dissapointed me. They quickly warped and could not get the sticky cooking spray film off once baked in the oven. The Norpo Stainless steel Jelly Roll pan that I purchased at the same time as lasted much better. Not sure why because they are the same brand, but this one lasted about 2 months before I trashed it."
2,So-So,"I purchase two of these - one was fine, the other one was scratched. It looked like someone took a very sharp knife and ran it down the one end. It was a pretty deep cut and atleast 6 inches long. Not sure what the problem is!!!!!!!!!!!!"
2,Embarrased to give as a gift,"While these baking sheets do appear to be well-constructed, they arrived with significant damage - one already opened with scratches all over, and another warped and dented! With no damage to the package, it is clear that they were packed in this condition. I'm embarrased to give them to my mother-in-law as a gift, and I'm disappointed that Amazon would ship a product in such condition."
3,Label glue,"This is a standard stainless steel cookie sheet of traditional variety. Unfortunately, the label is glued onto the sheet with some very persistent polymer. After 2 rounds in the dishwasher, the glue remains. The glue spreads with scraping. What a bummer."
2,cheap,Thin and cheap for the price- OVER priced. Warped upon taking them out of the package...not impressed. Don't want to spend the $$ to ship them back.
3,Decent,"I read the reviews that it buckles at 400 degrees, and what do ya know it starts buckling. However, at lower temperatures like 300 degrees it remains flat.Its the best stainless steel cooking sheet that we can afford right now. It gets the job done well enough. Now I don't have to worry about getting sick from Teflon; that is, if the 'experts' don't change their mind about what is toxic."
2,Cookie sheet,"This cookie sheet is very thin. I've used it a few times for baking gingerbread cookies and it cooked them okay, but I would not buy it again. It would be better if it were thicker. It looks and feels kind of cheap."
2,thin as cardstock,"i was looking forward to this cookie sheet, i bake all the time, and this is as thin as cardstock"
2,Sounded great at first but became a real Let-down,I think all the Neo-tech authors should try to be a little more versatile in their writing. They start becoming monotonous in their wording so much that it becomes more of a hassle than a joy to read it. The funny thing is that most of their reason for writing seems to be from their personal conflicts with the IRS. What works for them definitely does not necessarily work for everyone else.
4,Bueatiful love poems,This book has a lot of really great poems by authors such as Ivan Franko. It is a really wonderful book. The poems and translations are beautiful.
4,Not the whole show,"What is on the CD is great, however, it is only the first half the show. The liner notes, apparently written when it was an album, gives the names of the songs on the 3rd and 4th sides of the second album. However, in this package was only one CD, the first half. I believe this was intentional, there was no mention of a 2nd CD and no second slot for it. Would not have been upset if the description had clearly said this, but it said the ""Evita 1978 Original Broadway Cast"" which would definitely lead me to believe it would contain the entire show. It is not highlights from the show, it is the entire 1st half, and that is it. ""Don't Cry for me Argentina"" is not on this CD. So ask questions when you order!"
5,Classic - always was,"The story behind the songs from the play is about Evita Peron, her life and rise to power and demise.Yes this is a classic from the beginning. This play is one of the, if not the high point for Andrew Lloyd Webber and Tim Rice. Everything comes together to tell of this point in history. The inflections of the singers leave you with the question of who was Evita and does not sway you to any one point of view. The Songs themselves have more of a feel of the time than originals from that time would have.Being a play and not a movie the singers had to sing and be heard and understood. All of the performers are professionals in their own right; especially Patti LuPone Who has to perform with very little breathing room. She also has a good range and depth. So be sure to look for ""1978 Original Broadway Cast""Evita: The Complete Motion Picture Music Soundtrack"
2,"Good music, bad singers.","Ok, first of all don't go around dogging the film soundtrack. Its sales rank is ahead of that of this CD by about 1000. Second of all, Patti just isn't meant for the role. Her voice is too strong. Its strength is the same whether she sings ""Don't cry for me, Argentina"" or Evita's song oner deathbed. As for Pattinkin, his voice is too soft. Che is a bitter, discontent character. Which is why Banderas' voice is better for the role (even though Pattinkin's voice is better in general). As for the music itself, it gets five stars from me in every version."
2,Awful!,"This CD is one of the worst I have ever heard. It is awful. My school is doing this play and we were encouraged to listen to this recording. First of I have to say Pattie LuPone is horrible in this recording. It sounds like the notes are to high and that she is struggling to reach them.Madonna makes a much better Eva than Pattie LuPone. Secondly, the man who plays Peron is also bad. His constant rolling of his R's gets extremely annoying. The only reason I gave this CD two stars is because of Mandy Patinkin, who does a great job as Che,although his vibrato can get out of hand. The other reason is beacause the music is wonderful, they just needed to get better people for the roles."
5,"It's great, and the voices are terrifics","Lupone tine una voz magnifica en la cual pone a EVITA como una mujer interesada, el CHE no tiene muy buena voz ya que la agravia mucho, PERON tiene una voz gruesa muy apropiada para el papel. De verda amantes de EVITA esta es una joya invaluable en American Cast. ARCOIRIS EN ALTO (RAINBOW HIGH) LUPONE DIO EL MAXIMO, ES BUENISIMA! 1"
2,Broadway sound track EVITA,I was very disappointed to receive only 1 disc (Act 2). My favorite songs are in Act 1. The ad didn't mention it was only one disc.
2,Please. Buy another recording. ANY other recording.,"I have listened to myriad versions of Evita. The concept recordings, the Original London Cast (the best!), the movie, the touring casts...this Original Broadway Recording. Unhappily, this is the worst one of all. Patti LuPone ruins the music with her heavy sound that sounds as though it emanates solely through her nose. While appropriately enthusiastic in songs like ""Buenos Aires,"" she lacks a certain youthful vibrance that Elaine Paige captured perfectly in the OLC. And the Che on this recording lacks David Essex's bite and sarcastic tone, also available on the OLC. If you're looking for a stage recording to compare with the recent movie, a word to the wise: do not buy the Broadway recording. It's painful, to say the least."
1,dissatisfied,"I was shipped half of the soundtrack to Evita. This is a 2 disc set and I received only 1 disc, the first act. I e-mailed this company with no response. I am extremely disappointed in this company."
1,Worst Version of Evita available,"YIKES!! This has got to be the worst version of Evita available. This recording deserves a -100 stars. A one star rating is way too high for this cd. The movie version is a million times better than this terrible recording. Patti LuPone sounds like a bull moose stuck in the mud and the rest of the cast isn't much better. The singers have no feeling for the music and screech and yell their way through this musical. Listening to the track ""Buenos Aires"" I confirmed my feeling that Ms. LuPone is one of the worst singers around. I love ""Evita"" and I think it is one of the best musicals around but don't waste your money on this recording. Buy the soundtrack version definetely."
5,The definitive recording of Evita!,"This was the version that I was first introduced to. I fell in love with Patti, Mandy and the rest of the cast upon the first listening. While Madonna did a fine job, and probably deserved more recognition from the Academy, Ms. LuPone's Eva is filled with a passion and fire that Madonna's just couldn't touch. Through Patti, we see some more of the forces that were driving Eva. I have noticed that people either love Patti or hate her, I am definitely on the love side."
5,Superior Cast Recording!!,"If you are looking for the quintesential Rice/Webber soundtrack, this one is it!! It is as close to the original show as you can get (I saw it twice!!) You will never hear more expressive performances than those of Patti LuPone and Mandy Patinkin, with an extraordinary supporting cast too! If you are looking for THE Evita soundtrack, forget that drivel that Madonna recorded--you will not be disappointed!"
1,People call this a great musical?,"I hate ""Evita""! Nothing was so remarkable about her. Many famous leaders and celebrities grew out of poor beginnings. Lincoln was born in a one room log cabin! Patti LuPone saves the day by singing these stupid songs with passion and vigor. She almost makes it bearable to listen to this musical. As for the rest of the cast, the producers probably went with the cheapest."
1,Patti LuPone doesn't sing up to her potential,Patti LuPone just can't match how she normally sings on this cd. I normally like Patti's singing but not on this cd.
1,Evita CD 1978 broadway cast,"What a disappointment when we realized that we only received 1 CD and therefore only Act 1 . We tried several times to tell ""Books-R-Fun"" that we do not want our money back but please send Act 2. This company sells merchandize through Amazon and to my mind if they do not send what should have been sent...something is terribly wrong. We e-mailed ""Book-R-Fun"" and they did not ever respond. We are still looking for the full CD recording of Evita 1978 the original Broadway Cast.Does anyone know how to get it???"
3,"Lovely concept, needs better formatting","I bought this book because I loved the name, the cover, and the concept of incorporating love stories into a cookbook designed for newlyweds. I've already found several recipes I'd like to try, and I liked the advice for cooking and using certain appliances. The only thing I didn't like was the tiny font of the love stories that made them difficult to read. There also could have been more explanation as to how the couples for the love stories were selected and the book could have a better introduction to tie the whole concept together."
1,NOT THE PRODISC CD-Rs I ORDERED,"After reading the reviews i thought my problems were soved in finding Digital Audio CD-Rs that work with my Phillips Stand alone burner, My shiping statement said that the product that i ordered was the Prodisc Digital Audio CD-R 100 pack which was what i ordered BUT Insted i got a 100 pack of Spin-X CD-Rs that DO NOT WORK WITH MY BURNER I AM VERY UPSET WITH THE SERVICE OF AMAZON AND THERE ORDERING SYSTEM I WILL LOOK FOR ANOTHER PROVIDER IN THE FUTURE. DO NOT LET THIS HAPPEN TO YOU READ BEFORE OPENING THE PACKAGE BECAUSE YOU CAN NOT GET YOUR 25.85 BACK IF THE PACKAGE IS OPENED."
1,"Don,t be fooled!","DON'T BE FOOLED! I read some mixed reviews , and still decided to go ahead with purchase - - Big mistake , these cd- r's state they are Music cds and will record on Digital Audio Recorders - but they will not! They will record on my laptop cd burner - so not a total waste of money. They are cheap , I suppose , however they are falsely advertised as Digital Audio Discs. SO BEWARE !"
1,Worthless digital audio cds,Received these from Amazon. Purchased the 'digital audio' CDsfor my TEAC LP-R400 LP to CD recorder since regular CD-R CDs willnot work; must be 'Digital Audio'.Anyway I am returning these CDs because it is impossible todetermine which side of the CD is the recordable side; bothsides look identical with no marking of any kind. Take a lookat any purchased music CD and look at the shiny silver side youinsert into a player silver side down in order to play.Now picture both sides of these CDs looking just like the silverside. Duh . . . which side do I insert down on the recorder.Can't tell so I am returning. What a waste of time to have purchasedthese.
3,Tricky Discs,"These discs are tricky to use, don't throw a disc out if it doesn't read or you get an error message or an error when finalizing, sometimes you have to try to finalize a few times before it takes. just pop the disc out and put it back in, let it read, I found it's good to play a couple tracks on an unfinalized disc prior to finalizing, then for some reason it will finalize. Bottom line don't freakout right away when you get an error message. These discs do die, but most of the time a dead disc isn't really dead."
2,SPIN-X CD-R80,I first purchased this item in 2009 and they worked fine for my Philips stand alone recorder. But my recent re-order proved otherwise; my deck won't accept them at all. Maybe because they are made in Taiwan or because my deck is getting old and is extra picky (Mitsui discs work great but cost more). I suppose they'll work for computer use but I already have too many for that purpose. Beware they may not work in all recorders as stated.
5,Pretty good,"Got this for a friend as a present who likes naruto/anime. It came before the estimated date which was nice, and its very good quality."
4,"Not bad, but not his best story","I've read nearly all of Don Coldsmith's ""Spanish Bit"" books and like them all. This is not one of his best, in my opinion, but it's still good. I think it might be getting close to the time for him to bring the story of ""The People"" up to modern times, perhaps do a book or two about how they fare in today's world, and then close that saga out. This one concerns a woman who has been accused of being a Raven Mocker, which is someone who steals other people's lives, in order to continue living. She ends up moving to another area to get away from such accusations. It was definitely worth reading, but not one of my favorites."
3,"GOOD INTRO, BUT CERTAINLY NOT THE BEST","The beauty of this book lies in its choice of simple terms, when analyzing complex issues. A good introductory effort! Also, the tutorials of its accompanying CDs would enhance revisions.Most readers will appreciate the way this book handled all those discussions partaining to microbial taxonomy, bacterial growth, and viral replication. Unlike many introductory microbiology texts, this one presented comprehensive information on the nature of prions.But, even with the embellishments that included two CD-ROMs and web access, the retail price of this book is far from reasonable. This textbook delivered decent output on medical aspects of microbiology. However, it ran average info on industrial applications of microbiology; and performed poorly on environmental aspect. It remains a good book, but given its relatively high price and unbalanced coverage, I would not rate it as my first choice. There are many better texts in the market."
5,Very Good book,I always thought Mr. Tortora was a great writer. He knows how to convey highly advanced medical information in a easy to comprehend matter. This book is not any different. I highly recommend also the following which is on amazon:Microbiology Study Guide: Key Review Questions and Answers by Patrick LeonardiThis second book helped me with the type of questions to prepare for on my medical microbiology exams. The first book is needed to get the knowledge. The second book is needed to know what is going to be asked on the test.
5,It Works,Ordered as a replacement for the one left in a rental car. Fast shipment and a good price. Easy to program.
5,Superb!,This is such a fabulous production of country and soul mixed up and matched up PERFECTLY!!!! I would strongly suggest that you give it a listen!!1
5,Great CD!!!!,I love country music & enjoy R&B. This is a great CD!!! Took it to work everyone LOVED IT!!! I will be looking for more.
5,YOU have to hear it to believe it,"I was never a big fan of country music but this is the perfect lead in...the contrast of the singers/musicians is just out of this world...my positive favourite is Travis Tritt and Ms Patty LaBelle doing 'Something Is Wrong With My Baby'...I cannot tell you how many times I've rewound to get back to that song! All I can say is, get this and take a listen it, it is well worth the money you'll pay for it....Another added bonus is the PBS documentary on the making of this musical wonder...check it out if you get a chance!"
3,"Lots of talent, falls short","While this CD undoubtedly has big names participating, the chemistry is sometimes non-existant. Simply having big names going through the motions isnt what country or R&B is about. That being said, the two tracks worth having are the lovett and green one, and the toussaint and atkins one. Considering the artists involved, the other tracks are only good to mediocre."
5,awesome,"One of best variety mixture of music by the most talent artists ever. Blend of country with rhythm & blues, enjoying the album greatly."
5,Rhythm Country and Blues,"Had this disc back in 1994, watched the special. Was lucky enough to find it again. This is a great collaboration between the artists. Super idea and super disc."
4,Wonderful Songwriter-Very tallented singer,"This cd is the first I've heard of Belinda Gail. It took one listening through to get the feel of her style and on the second time around I was hooked! It's really hard to pick a favorite, but the top three from this cd would be Montana Cowgirl, Warm Owyhee wind, and Two seated saddle."
5,Great DVD to show a band,This DVD is so unique! I showed it to each of my bands and leave it playing on the TV in the h.s. band hall before school each morning.It's great to have reinforcement of some of the things I've told the kids and it even introduced them to some new ways of thinking and preparing to do their best.I especially like the last part that reminds everyone to keep competition in perspective.Great companion to the book!
4,TASTE GREAT!!! AND GREAT PRICE,THE PACKAGES ARRIVED ON TIME AND WERE REALLY NICELY PACKAGE IN A STRONG CARDBOARD BOX.THE PRICE WAS REALLY GREAT ON THIS ITEM AND THE MEAL IS VERY SMOOTHLY GROUND AND TASTY.I DO RECOMEND THAT THE UNUSED MEAL BE REFRIGERATED IN THE THE FREEZER SECTION FOR CONTINUED CONSISTENT TASTE AND POTENCEY I JUST KEEP 3 SERVING IN A GLASS JAR ON THE COUNTER BEFORE REFILLING.THERE IS NO REAL DEFROST TIME AFTER REMOVING THE PACKAGE BELIEVE ME I'VE DONE IT!!!.I WOULD HAVE GIVEN IT 5 STARS IF THEY WOULD GIVE ME A FREE BAG ONCE IN WHILE SEEING HOW I EAT SO MUCH OF THERE PRODUCT.
5,"Hands down, best flaxseed I've ever had!","I was a huge fan of FlaxUsa's flaxseed, but after purchasing a 2 lb bag from Big Lots, I'm never switching back. The flaxseed has a delightful texture, and doesn't give off a gross taste if it's left sitting in liquid for too long. I find myself pouring 3 tablespoons or more into my oatmeal. So yummy!"
4,Great Low Carb & Fiber Alternative for Atkins & Diabetic's,"Seller ships quickly & great bargain compared to supermarket prices & grinding the raw seeds yourself. There are recipes online for a Focaccia flat bread & we just made some muffins with walnuts & almonds that turned out pretty good. The bread is dark like a bran & consistency of banana bread & was thinking of experimenting & mixing with almond flour or regular flour to see how it turns out. Don't expect it to be like your supermarket loaf of bread but at 0 net carbs, you can have a great alternative to sandwiches, snacks & fiber. Check out the links & enjoy:[...][...][...]"
2,Flaxseed is very tasty and wonderful for health benefit only if you get the good quality one!,"I have been using flaxseed meal over the past three years; I would use them on almost everything from salad, soup to baking good. And, among several different suppliers on the market, I like Bob's Red Mill best for its reasonable price and trusty brand name.However, the latest batches I ordered were not nearly as good as before. They are dark, coarse (most is barely gridded), and BITTER!!!Check if yours with sell-by date later than 10/2008."
5,Excellent source of omega3,"I have been taking this product for 3 years and buying directly from Bob's Red Mill. It is an excellent source of omega3, good for your heart and lowering your colesterol. But, I have found that Amazon.com has the best prices for this product. Definitely will continue to buy from Amazon.com."
2,wrong part,"Did not really fit my application. In order to use these slip on boots, i would have had to remove the factory sealed rubber boots."
4,Char's Counterattack good movie-sequel to shows.,"First of all if you like the original gundam-released in both a 3 movie version and in a series-then you will like this film. The movie features impresive space battles, topics from the previous Gundams, and all the old crew; those that survived Zeta and zzGundam that is. The special features are almost nonexistance, though there is a very handy booklet that has a timeline on MSG, G 0080, G 0083, Zeta G and ZZ G. If you are a gundam fan and you haven't seen MSG Char's Conterattack do so."
4,What a Kick-Ass anime movie,This movie came on one time on Adult Swim I loved it only cause of the action the story to me was just boring but what do expect from an 1988 film.
1,disappointing,"if you're in for the story, i recommend watching this only for closure. especially if you sat through the whole double zeta series like i did.i really wish they would've at least given this a mini series to add more depth to the story. also, i really wish they would get rid of the horrible teenage girl characters that just distract you from the real story and add frustration and embarassment for the way these characters act.it seems that this movie almost ignored everything that happened after the original gundam series and acts as a direct sequel. char ends up looking like a yuppie and amuro barely looks any different at all.i'm taking a break from the universal century after this disappointment and i'll watch gundam wing."
3,Beautiful animation but the story falls flat.,"The title says it all. The quality of animation is absolutly top notch but the story makes absolutly no sense! Being a fan of the original Gundam series I expected a lot from this DVD in terms of story and I have yet to see Z Gundam which falls in between the original seris and Counterattack. But none of the charachters seem to have any clear motivation for doing anything that they do in this movie. In general the acting is stiff and the purple haired girl is just plain silly and just helps bring the whole thing down. Where's Sayla, Hyato and some of the other original cast? It would have helped continuity a little. You just have Amuro, Bright, Char and Mirai (who spends the whole movie dawdling around on earth pointlessly). This can't be a fault of the translation, it's a flawed, bad story from the get go. It's a shame."
5,Gundam Chars counter attack,"Personally I have been a fan of the gundam series for a long time. If you are a gundam fan and have not seen this movie, you should. In my opinion its a 5star movie and worth watching over and over and a great and to anyones movie collection."
2,Terrible characters can't overcome the action,"One of the worst Gundam movies I've ever seen due to the ridiculous characterisation. The hero and the archenemy bickering like former lovers (possible hidden plot twist there), the very annoying, spoiled Quess Paraya and the improbable Hathaway Bright losing it at the end all spoiled it for me despite the lush robot battle porn. One more reason why 08th MS Shotai and 0083 are far superior. Hopefully, when Z or ZZ Gundam inevitably comes out. . ."
5,The Superior,"Char's Counterattack is simply the best Gundam feature of all time. The battles particularly are breathtaking. As other reviewers have said, the two kids are annoying as heck. And you do need to see the original series or movies to understand the conflict between Amuro and Char. But for those of us who love giant robo action, this is the holy grail of anime. I've waited ten years to get this on DVD, and I am not dissapointed. The included booklet is very well done and is a nice extra. The reversible cover is also slick. The music is remastered in both Japanese and English 5.1 Dolby, and it is better than the laserdisc version."
1,"Great movie, but don't order this item","The movie is great, don't get me wrong. I borrowed a friend's copy and loved it so much I had to have one for myself. Of course, the collector in me wanted the nice version, with the sleek slip cover and Neo Zeon symbol. Don't bother trying to get that here. When my order came in, it was sans slip cover and booklet. If you're fine with that, than order yours today. If you aren't shop around, because there are places that will actually give you what you try to purchase."
4,MSG Char's Counter Attack The Final Confrontation,When this first came out many American gundam fans had not seen much of what happened in between 0083 and this (Zeta Gundam and ZZ Gundam). I like to see things in order but other people were fine with it. I did make an exception for this though and I'm glad I did. It has a sad but hopeful ending. I will not give away more than that.
5,Hail... Zeon...,"I have long since given up hope on the Gundam franchise due to SEED destroying everything that made it interesting to me, but my love for the One Year War story persuaded me to pick this epic movie up. And man, was I surprised!There are no needlessly flashy Gundams, no color changes, no characters who you believe are girls for 3 episodes before you find out it's a man! (purple haired guy from SEED) Nor are there any needlessly cheesy love stories that get in the way of the War's story.This is the end of the original series, real tactics are used, the mobile suits look amazing, and the animation is beautiful for being an 80's film. Unlike so many Gundam things out now, you wont find any overpowered god-like Gundams, or BS excuses for tactics, but quite the opposite! This movie saved Gundam for me. 5/5 for one Hell of a conclusion to one of Anime's greatest stories!"
5,Simply one of the best!,"What more can I say than this is a prime example why Mobile Suit Gundam is amazing! If you are true Gundam fan, and know that Gundam Seed is a terrible joke, then you NEED to have this film. Yoshiyuki Tomino just makes another master piece for all to see by providing Japan, and the whole world with one of the most ground breaking anime series ever. The DVD is good quality, provides Japanese and English dub. If you're dying for Blu-ray, go cry a river. The DVD is just fine to experience this film. However if you do get blu-ray, make sure your TV isn't one of those stupid HD TVs that randomly speed up images (those should all be recalled!). True Gundam fans NEED this film, and thats that!"
3,Bondage Breaker,This series is good but it wasn't quite what I was looking for. I was looking for something for young men and it doesn't quite fit what we were trying to get across.
1,extremely offensive to non-catholic belief and free thought,"It says how those who disagree with mainstream Catholic belief will be sent straight to hell. I found this book to be extremely offensive, infabricated, and to top it off it was poorly written. Sentences were short and choppy, the book was not organized and teneded to stray from the subject. I found this book to be extremely racist and I hope you do not find yourself reading this book. Thanks for hearing me out"
2,I was disappointed . . .,"We love ""QU"" whenever we hear it on PBS. So, I bought this CD thinking that the other songs would be great as well. I was very disappointed. The tunes aren't ""catchy"" like QU and my 19 month old didn't get excited about the music like he does with Laurie Berkner's CDs. Other people seem to love this CD, but we weren't impressed."
3,Not up to my expectations,"I've read a lot of reviews for this album, so I though it would be a slam dunk purchase. I can't say that I hate this CD, but I don't love it either. My 18-mo-old daughter seems to be indifferent to the music. Maybe it will grow on us."
5,"Buy it for baby, buy it for you","I've been hearing this music and Playhouse Disney, and my husband and I knew we had to get it as soon as it came out. I don't know who enjoys it more: me or my 19 month old son. It's a great, fun learning CD. I guess you'd say that it's on the less conservative/traditional side, but it's certainly suitable for any child. Just like the DVD, it's excellent and the price is great! Don't hesitate!"
4,More Children's Tunes from TMBG,"This is a very good album, much more on the light and happy side, more along the lines of Flood rather than The Spine. All TMBG fans should own it, especially anyone who like No! While not as good as No! in my opinion, it is still top-notch, perfect for all the young and young-at-heart."
5,everything you need to know on XiangQi,You'll find everything you have to know in David Li's Xiangqi books. I own the four titles and heard about a fifth coming soonThis one is perfect for XiangQi beginners and others too.Don't hesitate to buy this one !
2,"described as vegicaps, these are actually solid and somewhat large tablets.","inaccurately described. Not veggie caps. Large, solid tablets. This makes a difference to poor pill swallowers so beware."
4,a good refresher,"Yes, the footage is a little dated, but the information is still accurate. My husband and I took the full Lamaze series of classes when we were expecting our daughter in 2003. We needed a refresher for the birth of our son (due in 2005), but were unable to attend Lamaze classes in-person due to scheduling conflicts. This video (available in VHS and DVD format) provided us just what we needed and, as an added bonus, included two live births (one vaginal delivery and one c-section). The information contained in the video and the structure of the filmed class seemed almost identical to the in-class training we received in 2003."
2,"Basic, sloppy and outdated","This tape is a very basic childbirth informational video, and not the in-depth Lamaze training video my wife and I were hoping for as a refresher course for our second child's delivery. [...]I really expected a whole lot more. The camera work wasn't very good, and just based on hair styles the video looks like it was recorded in the 1970s. The two women who did the talking both egregiously and repeatedly mispronounced the word ""centimeter"" (a cornerstone word for childbirth), and not-so-advanced words like ""synonymously"" were misused. The two presenters also kept breaking out in fits of laughter over silly comments they kept interjecting."
3,Good if you put to use,"Its a very informative video, however you and your partner need to have time to watch and follow along, otherwise who knows how much of it you will retain. It is much better than reading another book."
1,Time for an update !!!!!! Old and very outdated. Do not waste your money !!!,Old School!!! The techniques are old and the DVD is very annoying. The owners of this program are obviously CHEAP. You pay 39.00 for this and it is a rip off!!!
2,Not enough information,"The video is obviously set in the 80's. I don't feel like it focused enough on relaxation techniques. Actually the only technique it taught was breathing. Since it is labeled ""a complete lamaze childbirth class"" I expected more information on what occurs during all three labor stages. The video did mention all three stages but did not go into enough detail. It was also a basically boring video, I could see my husband losing focus after only ten minutes."
2,Very Disapointed,"I purchased this video to use in my practice. I am a nurse midwife and I wanted a video class for my clients. I was very disapointed in this video. It was old and very boring, I will not use it as part of our education department. The information was not up-to-date, the video says 2001, but it is not. It is more like 1980's."
1,Very Outdated,"After reading the other reviews, I thought it would be a good purchase. My husband travels a lot and I wanted him to be a part of the lamaze training so I ordered this video. It was very poor quality with the sound coming in and out. The information was outdated and the people in it seemed to be out of the 70's. I was very disappointed. There was nothing useful at all on this video. I was able to get more valuable information out of my ""What to Expect When You're Expecting"" book. I would not purchase this!"
2,out dated,"this vidoe had a lot of information, but it seemed a little out dated. it did have some good tips on lamaze and covered good relative topics, but seemed to be slow moving and old fashion."
1,"Nail in the coffin for True, Quality Childbirth Education","Made in 1983, these so-called caring childbirth educators pooled their resources and gave birth to this movie. For almost 25 years this film has greatly contributed to couples thinking they can get something for nothing (watch a video=know how to birth the Lamaze way). REAL Lamaze training is out there and there is no substitute for the personal attention and quality training provided. Don't be too busy for classes. You'll be sorry. Take a class and don't waste your money on this film which personally and globally negates what's needed for normal birthing in America.JB/Hawaii"
1,No audio,"I would have liked to have watched this, but it has no audio. Must be a defective DVD. I'll be returning it."
1,keep away,this Dvd is so out dated and really doesnt show active birth or anything like it......save your money
1,Hee and Blow #2,"Rule #1 - Read ""Hee and Blow"". Then, DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY OR YOUR TIME BUYING THIS USELESS VIDEO. This video was a complete waste of time and did not prepare us at all for the birth. In fact, I think that my wife (and I) did fine without it. I read ""Hee and Blow"" and thought, 'how bad could it be' and bought the video anyway. Yes, it's that bad - high school students could've produced a better childbirth class. I am surprised that there isn't a better video for childbirth on the market."
5,An excellent refresher for a busy family,"We checked this out from our local library and LOVED it. It was so helpful in the preparations for our 2nd child. We decided to buy it for the 3rd. We found it so helpful and useful we wouldn't prepare for childbirth without it. It is somewhat outdated in some areas of labor and delivery, but the content of explaining how to breath through and relax during contractions is timeless. A must if you need a refresher on a childbirth class. This helped me go through an epidural free labor and very smooth delivery of #2."
1,"Outdated, terrible picture, just BAD","Luckily I did not purchase this product but borrowed it from my local library. I was immediately confused because the cover looks relatively recent, but it's obvious from watching it that it was filmed during the height of VHS, perhaps in the 80's. It's such bad quality that it's distracting, and I couldn't bear to watch for more than 10 minutes. It may be informative, but I don't know because I couldn't get past the outdated props and poor quality of the film. Save your money to buy something more up to date."
1,Out of Date 1985 vdieo into DVD? .,"As a Lamaze Certified Childbirth Educator, I must tell you that this is an old 1980s video that was made into a DVD in 2001. This DVD is out of date!If you contact Lamaze International (Lamaze.org) you will find out that Lamaze doe not sell this DVD and in fact does not use this old method any more.This is NOT what you will be learning in a Certified Lamaze class.Jo Schopflin, CD(DONA), LCCE"
1,DO NOT BUY,I really want to attempt a natural delivery (without medications) and hoped I could get a few breathing technique from this video (I was wrong). I'm trying to avoid the Lamaze classes because I already have such a busy schedule. I didn't find it much help at all. I wish I could find a more current video than this one. Before I bought this I wasn't able to determine when this was actually taped but it looks like its from the 70's. Not exactly entertaining. I had a hard time staying concentrated on the video and found it very boring. I wouldn't recommend this tape to anyone. Still searching for a better DVD with more breathing technique that's at least filmed in the 90's.
3,Definitely dated,"I got this because I couldn't find any Lamaze classes in my area and this was the only DVD I could find. Even so, it's quite dated (80s, I think), so that was a turn off at first, especially for my husband who was already was skeptical of ""that schmarmy crap"". I was hoping for something a bit more engaging."
4,Good DVD,"A great way to allow visual learners the opportunity to understand labor and delivery! However, the significant parts of the video move quickly while too much time is spent on breathing and relaxation (which are important, but in the video they are so important the teachers almost take too much time on this). The video is outdated; however, any traditional Lamaze books that are read in addition to watching this video basically give you the same information. There have been some changes (like the discussion of pain medication during labor and delivery) since the times of Dr. Lamaze; but the breathing techniques are either the same or improved to help the mother get through the process naturally.Make sure you read books on this subject as well!"
3,"Okay, but...","Basically the same information that the hospital parenting/birthing class gave...nothing new. In fact, hospital staff recommended against the old school ""hee hee"" breathing as it could lead to hyperventilation (newer techniques avoid this). The fact that this was OBVIOUSLY filmed in the 70's made it difficult to practice and relax as we both had the giggles. Finally, the pronunciation of centimeter as ""sont-a-meter"" was completely distracting. Worthwhile if you are not attending a parenting/birthing class at your hospital (which I highly recommend!!) as the information is good. If you are signed up for a class at the hospital, you can safely avoid this...."
4,Having Your Baby! A Complete Lamaze Prepared Childbirth Class,"I live overseas and Lamaze classes are not taught here. I was pleasesd to find them offered on amazon through this dvd. I have found the informations helpful. I think if I was in the states I would prefer a more up to date dvd. The Lamaze technic has not changed but I know the medical advise offered and the ""standared procedures"" discussed in the video are out dated. For me it was perfect because the medicine oversea were I am is almost up to date with what is being advised in the dvd.They did a great job with this dvd it is just time for an update."
1,So 1980s...,"We were very surprised to receive a video that predates the CD, let alone DVD. Content was old and outdated. Some of the medications discussed are no longer in use anymore. We purchased the video because all the birthing classes in our area are full and wouldn't take us, and we were left disappointed by this ancient video once we finished laughing about the wardrobe and music selections."
3,Informative But Outdated,"I purchased this DVD instead of taking a childbirth class. When my husband and I sat down to watch it, our first impression was that it seemed like it was filmed in the 70s or 80s. This turned us off before we even began listening to the information. We wondered how current the information was and what we might be missing. Overall, the DVD did seem informative covering general Lamaze techniques like relaxation, focal points, and breathing as well as specific issues like induction, pain medications, and cesarean. We just couldn't get into it like we would have in a live setting, and I don't feel confident that we will actually use the techniques during our upcoming labor and delivery. I think taking the class would have been a better idea for us."
1,Better Options - Not Modern,"The information in Having Your Baby is old, outdated, and feels like its from the 80's. That alone makes it difficult to take seriously, but the breathing methods are not natural. I preferred Labor 101 and Laugh & Learn to this video. If you want to go natural get Labor 101...if you just want a general idea of what's going to happen in the delivery room and don't mind a lot of potty jokes buy Laugh & Learn. Either way, Having Your Baby isn't the best investment for childbirth instruction."
3,"informative, but REALLY needs updated","I was unable to attend childbirth classes with my husband when we had our daughter, so i ordered this video.the informantion is in there, it is just very hard to get through. i was put off a bit by the instructors - nothing wrong with them- they just rubbed me the wrong way for some reason.The students in the class did give me a good chuckle tho. the motorcycle cop mustaches and 70's clothes definitely added some entertainment.it is a good video over all, it just moved very slowly"
1,It stinks!,"Whether or not this product works on your hair is beside the point-- it stinks!! Imagine the smell of mint and burnt plastic on moldy carpet, and now imagine this smell wafting from your hair! It lasts the entire day! I tried it twice (the second time only God knows why) just to be sure, and the rest of the bottle is going in the trash as unfortunately satisfaction is not guaranteed. Stay away!!!"
4,Another great Ace compilation!,"At least 12 songs I've never heard before, several that are different versions of songs that I am familiar with.There are a couple of cases where it would have been nice to hear a mono version instead of the overly familiar stereo (A Teenager In Love for example).The Del Shannon version of His Latest Flame is a particularly disappointing stereo, and the volume on the track is way too low in relation to other tracks on the compilation. The stereo has nothing happening on one channel for nearly half the record :(.There seems to be an actual defect on the Fabian track, at about the 1 minute mark.But these are trivial concerns, compared to having a nice companion to the Leiber and Stoller series."
4,A bit frustrating...,"Accustomed to give all ACE releases 5 stars because they more thandeserve them, this release is a bit frustrating not only because ofthe selection used, but also because some of the greatest tunes of alltimes are again in MONO. I know that there are a lot of ""purists"" whoprefer mono recordings but if an original stereo version does exist,I prefer that because a lot of ""unexisting"" instruments on a monorecording can be heard on the stereo one. There's a lot of differencewhen you hear ""Save The Last Dance For Me"" in stereo. The mono versionloses a lot. Ben E King's ""First Taste of Love"" is one of the greatestsongs ever if you can hear it in stereo. On this CD it's in mono andit loses half of the instrumental back-up orchestra. Some other songshowever, like Hushabye, are wonderfully presented so at least itstill can be classified as a 4 star CD."
1,Not All Old Is Gold,"Apart from the Drifters, this CD wins a prize as a wonderful example of how bad golden oldie pop music can be. Fabulous Fabian's ""song"" is an absolute hoot. Unless you are a collector of curio and the listen-ability of the music itself is not important, Don't Bother Buying."
1,NOT for anyone AT all experienced with the internet,"This book is not at all what I was expecting.The websites and ideas are very well known and some such as etoys do not even exsist anymore!It is very outdated and I think anyone who is at all familiar with the web knows about such sites as ivillage.It also gives you lists of very well known beauty,parenting and magazine sites.If you are looking for a book that will give you fresh ideas and fresh little known innovative sites this is not the book for you.Stick with a search engine and save yourself the money.You might even find better sites using a search engine!If you are very new to the web and need a very basic guidebook then this is for you.It is a great starting point.I am actually going to give this book to my Mother in law who has never surfed the web.That is about all it is useful for."
4,Good for beginners,This book covers every facit of the consultant role but felt a bit idealistic. If you are starting out in consulting or looking to improve your skills than this is a good starting out point.
1,A Good Bookend,"I read the first few chapters and felt that if I read anymore, my value as a consultant would be diminished. If you have anything else to read -- read it!!"
3,Maybe buy the hardcopy,"This seems to be a really good book, but trying to read all the fine print on the Kindle was tough at best. I grew weary of highlighting and expanding all the most important stuff. I recommend the hard copy for ease of reading."
2,Extremely wordy book full of redundancies,This is an extremely wordy book full of redundancies. I think it could have been written with two hundred less pages. I had the dig for what little meat it contained.
5,As promised,"The book arrived promptly and would have been considered a brand new book with the exception of a tear on the paper cover that had been taped. Otherwise, the book itself is perfect."
4,Real Hands On Advise,Used this book for my MBA program. Block offers some great hands on and step by step advice on how to handle several situations within the consulting relationship.
1,"Too many words, not enough content","The least amount of stars I could choose was one, otherwise I would most certainly have chosen NONE.I had to buy this book... for an online class at HWG/IWA (where I am a member). The class was on Contracting Your Services. The book was totally inappropriate and had nothing to do with web design contracts. Poorly written, with too much psycho-babbling, it could have been a 10-page paperback pamphlet with a list of pointers...I can't believe I bought this book, tried to read it and get something out of it. ....To give my instructor a bit of credit, I don't think there are any good books yet on this topic."
5,Don't let simplicity mislead you; this is right on target,"Re-reading this book after several years, and overseeing perhaps 125 student consulting projects, I am more impressed than the first time. In the past I'd taught consulting entirely on a practicum basis (common practice, by the way), but recently decided to add readings. We bought a couple dozen books - my assistant read all of them - and we settled on Block for the process and Biech's The Consulting Business for how to run one's own practice.As I watch my undergrad and grad students work through their projects, I find that Block speaks realistically and clearly to the essential challenges they face throughout. I know from experience that some people dislike his style. But I've also seen that, if they gain experience, they change their mind. I wish I'd required this (not just recommended it) long ago."
3,Pink Heart Creeper,"Great shoe, but the pink is hot pink and not the baby pink that is shown in all the online pictures. The hot pink dye started chipping and fading almost immediately, however, so buyer beware: keep a hot pink sharpie close by."
4,"Todd Snider's an ""Alright Guy""","Todd Snider is an excellent songwriter, as he proves with ""Songs for the Daily Planet."" He's confident enough in his abiility to hide the album's best song, ""The Band that Wouldn't Play,"" after the last listed track is completed. This witty parody of the Seattle grunge rock scene actually managed to gain Snider airtime on alternative rock stations despite the fact that he is at heart a country artist.Of the rest of the material, the highlights have to be the very amusing ""Alright Guy,"" the Who-referenced generational effacing putdown ""My Generation (Part Two)"" and the confessional ""That Was Me."" Snider's natually wicked sense of humor enlivens the best tracks, and is somewhat reminiscent of John Prine at his best. Only when he gets political, like on ""This Land is Our Land,"" does his music sound forced.Overall, a catchy and amusing album from a quirky artist who neatly straddles the line between rock and country."
4,Wonderfully Cynical and yet Refreshing,"I am not sure what the whole ""new country"" thing is - I know I hate Shania Twain and all the rest but when you bring todd snider up I smile.My favorite lyric:We'll buy anything from Diet SpriteTo 1000 points of lightI admit we're not that brightbut I'm proud anyway"
3,"witty, bluesy, country music on wry",Todd's a find all right. He's got some Loudon Wainwright III in him when I think he'd prefer to be more like Robert Earl Keen. LWIII tries so hard to be witty that his wonderful more serious songs get shrugged off. REK manages to have both embraced. Listen to this early effort along side East Nashville Skykline and you'll hear tremendous growth but still with a bit of that LWIII desperation to be taken seriously.
5,keep up with the fashion trends for the coming season,"InStyle has always been our ""go to"" magazine for seasonal fun, fashion and lifestyle. If you enjoy fashion, you can't go wrong with it, and if you need to buy a gift, it's fantastic for ideas. We love it!"
3,InStyle,The magazine seemed to be the abreviated version. Usually the magazine is quite large. Otherwise it was more than satisfactory.
1,Ordered in Feb and I still haven't received my mags.,"Ordered in Feb and I still haven't received my mags. I'm eager to receive my order, but it's taking awfully long!"
2,"Makeup and hair good, fashion bad","I bought my first issue of InStyle two years ago and its gone downhill imho. The article titles on the front typically have absolutely nothing to the article itself, like what to wear now does not explain what to wear now nor does it point you in any general direction. The only plus side to the magazine is that it features bargain prices on clothing every once in a while. The pairings of clothing they put together used to be great, very wearable for the daytime and for most people not in a fashion business. Now it seems as if they've tried to mimic the weirdness that you see in Lucky magazine.Another plus is the makeup and hair section, they do a good job showing what the newest trends in makeup are with a wide range of prices and products. FYI skintones are also factored in."
1,Haven't even received the magazine yet....,I ordered this subscription in mid December and still have not received my first issue. I would love to say I love the product though!
2,Elaine's lost magazine subscription,I had placed an order early January of this year and still am waiting anxiously to receive my first issue; it's already March!
3,I am sick of celebrities!,"I used to adore this magazine and I still do to some extent. However, I would rather not see so many celebrities. Who said they have all the fashion sense? When I pick up a magazine, I want to see lots of fashion to get ideas!!! I don't want to read about some actress or singer or rich person's aquisitions of designer clothes and shoes. It would be nice to see more what the trends are and how to put outfits together."
2,Sent Magazine to Wrong Person,"The magazine was mailed to my address but was not sent to the correct person's name. The name of the subscriber was supposed to be ""Anna"" but it was sent to ""Donna."" To make matters worse, I have a neighbor named ""Donna"" with the same last name that lives on my street. I contacted Donna to make sure she did not subscribe to InSytle and she said she did not. Needless to say, it is only a matter of time before the mail carrier gets confused and starts sending ""Donna"" the magazine. I was very disappointed by this and I am trying to contact InStyle to see if the subscription name can be corrected. As for the magazine, Anna really likes the one she received."
5,Great!,Everything expected! Would not renew subscription if it did not enjoy magazine!Contains articles I thoroughly enjoy reading.thank you
1,Price Change without notice,If Hearst Magazine is going to run a promotion then run the promotion for the full time. INSTYLE was $10.00 and before I could order the price changed to $23.98. Not a way to win customers!!!!
3,Haven't received it yet.,I gave it 3 stars because I already know I like it and hope to eventially receive it. I like it because of the fashion and the unretouched celebrity pictures. It's nice to see fashion in a magazine with people looking natural.
4,I have not received an issue as of today.,I have not received an issue as of today. I wish thatr I was able to review it for you. Sorry
2,Could Be Classier,"The beauty features of InStyle are very good, but much of this publication is only a step or two above tabloid trash. Why should entertainers be the standard on which the rest of us choose to look, dress, eat and live? Why are they the authorities? Why can't InStyle show clothes on real models? And, finally, why are so many of the clothes so ugly?"
1,InStyle Magazine subscription: Where is it?,"Additional comment June 2010: After reading quite a few issues now, I would not reorder. Frankly, I think most people on the street look better put together than most of the pictures in these articles. The outfits are either over the top and not particularly flattering.However, if you wear a lot of ball gowns and love those 8 inch heels with straps halfway up your calves, this is your magazine!I ordered InStyle Magazine on September 17. It would be nice to actually get a copy. Hard to imagine in this day and age that a company can ignore a customer that long!What do they do, print a limited supply of these magazines up months in advance?I still am holding out hope that I actually get a copy before the first of the new year."
3,Fun Magazine,"This magazine is great for people who have a lot of money! They do, however, provide some great beauty and clothing tips. There are way too many advertisements in this magazine, and I find it ridiculous to have to go through 20 pages sometimes to get to an article."
4,Still wondering...............,"I read this magazine in the doctor's office and if you are interested in fashion, makeup and trends then this is the magazine for you! I find that the magazine is an easy read for any age. I am over 40 and just loved it. The only problem is............I placed my order through Amazon 4 weeks ago and I still have not received my first magazine. I think it is silly that I have to wait 6-10 weeks from placing my order to receive my first copy. They have my money so I guess I just wait. I do want to add that the deal I got was an exceptional value. This is a thick magazine (think Cosmo) and will keep you entertained for hours."
5,Sweet Deal,This is the best deal on here. I've gotten it for myself and given it as a gift twice! Love it!
5,Love this magazine!,Instyle magazine has all of the latest styles and trends..with a lots of fun stars and style tips
3,"it's been fun, but...","In Style is at its core, a ""fun"" fashion magazine. I think they do a good job providing an entertaining and luxe-looking magazine for people who aren't really diehard fashionistas but like to look nice. I appreciate their relatively high quality and inventive ideas, targeting a slightly older audience than some fashion mags, and the refreshing lack of lifestyle information compared to some women's magazines. However, I am burnt out on all of the celebrity overexposure. If memory serves me correctly, In Style was one of the first women's magazines in the 1990's to start featuring a celebrity cover model and now that has become de rigueur and it is exhausting to me. I don't think I'll subscribe again soon, but I will read it when I come across In Style in a doctor's office or similar."
1,Little More than Commerical Advertisements,"This used to be an interesting magazine when I subscribed years ago, with features at celebrities homes, lifestyle entertaining, etc. I haven't subscribed in years and without looking at their current issues, subscribed again. On the good side the magazine arrived within 4 days.On the downside, the bulk of this once interesting magazine has deteriorated into little more than a commercial catalog advertisement for fashion. At the back of the magazine was a small article on Padma Lakshmi and her mother, the only thing worth reading.Not worth subscribing in my opinion."
1,MAgazine subcriptions,"I ordered three magazine subscriptions on December 8th as a Christmas gift for my daughter and as of today, February 6th, she has not yet received any. I am being told they will not be shipped until February 24th. Kind of a long wait don't you think?"
5,Great Mag!,"If you are looking for great fashion, great beauty tips, and just plain fun then this is the magazine for you. My daughters and I love looking at this together and enjoy sharing the tips we learn from it! This is the best price available too."
5,Love my new mag subscription!,"This was the best pricing for this magazine subscription. Received my first issue in about 8-10 weeks. What can I say, but that I love this magazine and am ecstatic to have gotten it for such a steal!"
3,I still have not received my first issue yet.,"I typically like this magazine a lot. I purchased my subscription over a month ago, so I'm just annoyed that I haven't received my first issue yet."
3,Good muisc but...............,"I am a guqin fan / a devoted player and delighted to see different schools of guqin music on the Amazon site. The music was nicely arranged but the player, Mr. Lin played every song in a sad tone.Guqin is a very original and pure Chinese music instrument dated back 2,000 yrs ago. Unlike guzheng, pipa, yang qin.... Guqin msuic is not influenced by any western music at all. Most of the pieces that we play nowadays are written 300 - 1,500 years.Each piece of guqin music is to articulate the feelings of the music pieces and a good player is capable of expressing its hidden story / feelings thru its string. Mr. Lin played well but all songs are grouped in a sad mode - he did not express or articulate the true feelings of the music piece. In general, if you are looking for a CD to relax, you will be pretty happy with this CD."
2,Disappointing,"I am very glad this was a free book. If I had paid any amount to read it I would be very upset. Although I am only 3/4 through the book, I do intend to finish it.Initially the story and characters caught my attention. However, as chapters passed, the writing became boring, and showed a definite lack of polish. Something changed. Errors became moire prevalent. The editing is very poorly done: punctuation and spelling errors, typos and skipped or incorrect words (perhaps due to spell check, rather than an actual editor?).As an historical account of an American Hero, I must admit that the book educates and enlightens the reader. I am just personally distracted by the lack of attention to editing.Sorry, but I cannot recommend this book unless L.J. Martin polishes it up and gets it re-edited."
3,interesting,"This was an interesting read. Kind of slow at times, but interesting. It isn't what i usually choose to read."
5,Rush To Destiny,"The story is about the adventures of Edward Fitzgerald Beale -- who I was faintly familiar with. I have to admit first that history books bore me (especially when I was in school) but if it's this type of writing, this type of story-telling rather, I would have had an A every time there was a pop quiz in history class. It was a treat for me to read!I have always enjoyed reading J.L. Martin books ever since I reviewed Silent Ops. This book is another keeper, although, in my opinion, almost all J.L. Martin books I consider as such. As always, I enjoyed reading every page and every word mainly because of the way the story was delivered. I've noticed that the author's style of writing is notable in almost all of his writings -- I'm a fan of it."
3,"Comfortable, but not sturdy","This mat was very pretty and very comfortable to stand on, but it just didn't hold up. I didn't have it for a month before the top design layer began to curl away from the mat and I had to throw it away."
4,a fatal flaw,"A constant delight for the Bill Monroe fan or any listener serious about bluegrass and its evolution. One serious flaw, however, and I don't know if it's been fixed, but the first disc and a half has a lot of flutter, probably from the analogue source. This really compromises the quality of the music and it is more audible, the more tracks listened to.Burt Shapiro"
4,Nice package,"The packaging of this box set is very nice. The booklet that comes with the set is a pretty good abbreviated history of this fascinating icon of American music. Particularly interesting is reading about all of the Bluegrass Boys who later became bluegrass greats themselves- Flatt and Scruggs, Del McCoury, Sonny Osborne, Mac Wiseman, Jimmy Martin and the list goes on.The only knock I have against this set is that some of the recordings are re-records of earlier Columbia classics, apparently at the behest of MCA records. It seems every box set either contains alternates or re-records which is puzzling to me. In the interest of history, I am only interested in the originally released recordings..."
4,Am I Making Six Figures Yet?,"Well, no. But then again I'm not putting all the steps into play. I bought this book because I'd been ""following"" James-Enger through various writing websites and magazines and I've always found her to be a straight-shooter with a good sense of humor.She covers a great deal of information that is particularly important to the novice business-person. I stress this, because the only way you are going to make six-figures at ANYTHING is if you think like a business owner.I'm already a business owner in a different field and agreed with all that was shared. It's a well thought-out book and useful from many angles.I have no doubt that if I were to sell my other business and focus solely on what is presented here (along with writing every day) I would be earning six-figures as a freelance writer. It's not rocket-science, it's a business! But one you can absolutely love!"
5,A Really Great Resource,"Kelly's book is a great resource both for people who are new to writing for magazines & journals, and for people who've been freelancing for a while who want to bump up their career.My co-author and I have written before, but never had a need to write a query. We followed Kelly's procedures for writing a tight, one-page query letter (and then also followed her procedures for writing a follow-up letter 6 weeks later), and received notice from our first choice magazine that they want to see the manuscript!I wrote a note to Kelly right away to tell her the good news and to thank her for her practical, easy-to-follow guidelines and examples."
4,Confirms that anyone can do it,"A very comprehensive book that provides a lot of useful information, and shows you how you can earn a serious income as a freelance professional."
1,An infomercial in print,"Reminded me of those late night infomercials featuring an exuberant salesperson telling you how you, too, can be as successful as they are if you only follow their advice to the letter. What this book boils down to is that persistence, hard work, networking and years of effort eventually pay off. I didn't need to spend money for somebody to tell me that but I did."
2,Disappointing,"If you're planning to dive full-time into writing as a business, this book will probably be helpful. If not, if you had in mind writing as a sideline occupation, you will likely be overwhelmed. Full of minutiae, this book is exhaustive and exhausting to read. For those ready to make the business of writing their life's focus, read on! For everyone else, read elsewhere."
4,Sold bike solid purchase,"I purchased the 24inch bike for my son for Xmas. I liked it so much that I got the 26 inch for myself. Let me tell you I'm very satisfied with this purchase. We have farmland all around us an it has been a joy to ride. Riding on the street is a pleasure as well, the bike has a very smooth ride on the street as well. Cant wait totake it on more trails in the everglades with the kids. No mechanical issues on either bike. It comes preassembled enough so that it is a breeze to put together. I am not done, I plan on getting the girls bike for my daughter."
3,False Advertising?,"I ordered this bike and when I opened the box and did an inspection, I noticed that the frame of the bike said STEEL tubing! This bike is listed as an aluminum frame! I am not sure if it was a mistake from the manufacturer or from Amazon, but I would check it out 1st before I buy."
4,Great bike but not for mountain biking,"This is a great bike for your average ride around a park but don't try to go mountain biking with it. I have had this bike for 2 months and have already bent the rim on a beginner mountain bike trail. Its a great price for a nice looking bike but you don't want to be stuck on a mountain bike trail and have to carry your bike back which is what I had to do and it was brutal! Knowing this, I would have waiting to buy and spent another $200 or $300 on a bike built for mountain biking."
3,Value for Money,"Bit mixed feeling with this bike. I have it now for two week and took it for a ride on a paved as well as a mountebike track. In both cases it has proven to be value for money; it rides pretty good on a paved road but in case you are looking to take it into the woods, I advise to buy a higher segment bikes. The quality is simply not good enough for it. I was tempted to rate it 4 stars but I had such a hassle with tuning the gears after I received it that I will tone it down one. If you are not a handy person (or have one in the family) I do not advise it. All-in-all this mountenbike is OK."
1,Quickly Broke Down...,"Unfortunately, after less than ten hours of use, one of the gear rings simply broke; I've never heard of that happening before; one can imagine the very fine alloy that went into its construction. Other than that the handles are awkward to use..."
2,Beware----Pinches fingers,The idea of this tow handle is good but if you don't hold it just right your fingers get pinched between the tow handle and the luggage pull-out handle.
1,On the first trip the handle fell off as the screw came undone.,I was excited to receive my luggage extender and planned to purchase more. I attached it to my bag and on the way back home the handle fell off. I found the screw and plan to put it back on when I return from my trip.
4,Unjustly neglected Ms Tree,"I reread my old Ms Tree comic books every year or two, but the '80s interest in her seems to have petered out in the marketplace: it's a pity, because they were good. I strongly recommend them to anyone who likes spandex-free detective comics of a hardboiled bent."
2,It's cute BUT....,After a few days it started to turn my finger GREEN. I'm very disappointed in this product. And I feel bad because my husband bought it for me as a gift. I would not recommend.
1,dissapointed,It was not at all what I thought it would be and it was too expensive. I want to get rid of it as soon as I can which will not be easy as it is a genealogical book and it is very limited.
2,Not happy,I was supper excited when I purchased this item. But when I tried to program it to my car there was no response from the remote. I changed the battery's nothing. I did everything I could think of o make I work. I'm going to try returning it or try getting a replacement.
4,"Character development very good, story line convoluted.","I've never written a book review before this, but I've read many, many books and know what I like. Believability is very high on my list, but also characters that are ""real"", situations that could happen in real life, even if stretched a bit.The Last Witness was a little hard to follow initially, sorting out the characters, but when it gelled, it really gelled. John Matthews is very good at telling a story with protagonists in different cities, even countries. Living their lives, but with the difficulty that is common to humans. His characters reach a crises point when the life that has always ""worked"" doesn't work anymore and action is required. Mr. Matthews characters react in ways you and I might react, if we were courageous and wanting to do the right thing. Many of his characters don't choose to do the right thing, and therefore the mystery. The choices that could also be you and I. A good read and worth the time."
2,Am Not Enjoying the Book,"I just read the 3 reviews currently present. The first two loved the book and so I found myself saying ""what am I missing?"" I then read the 3rd review and was pleased to know that I'm not the only one who has found this book really difficult to read and follow. I am actually over 50% through the book now and at this point the two very separate stories have not come together. Because there are two stories, I'm finding it very difficult to keep track of the characters in the book. This is my first read from this author and I can't imagine trying another book."
2,Needs more research and a good editor,"I would not usually comment on a book in this forum, but felt compelled to do so. The grammatical and spelling errors--at least in the Kindle edition --are so overwhelming the plot is lost. When you combine that with the fact that the author has clearly not even done the most basic research on the RCMP, the book is almost unreadable. The RCMP is not the police of jurisdiction in Montreal, or even Quebec and it is never, ever, referred to as the RM or the RC, as it is in this book. The usual, colloquial, term for an RCMP member is 'mountie' and they are known as that around the world. A waste of time and money"
2,Not enjoying it at all.,"I tried three times to get into this book. I managed to get about 25% into it but it didn't keep my attention. I'm not sure how the two stories might converge but at this point there is nothing in common between them other than the son. The writing seems to be less than engaging for me. I kept trying after reading the 5 star reviews but alas, it's not a book for me. There are many others out there that are much more enjoyable and engaging."
4,Excellent review of essential skills,"Hacker's Challenge 2 is a great review course for anyone in the security industry, or just a sysadmin who needs to know basic security skills (that means all of you sysadmins). The challenges range in ease of forensic review from really simple (DoS attacks and packet sniffing) to very challenging to diagnose.Probably the best part of the book is that along with every explanation of what happened, is an accompanying explanation of how it happened and what could be done to prevent it.I strongly recommend this book to anyone who wants to test or expand their network and host security skills."
1,No challenge,As a security specialist and Ethical hacker I've been extremely disapointed by this book. It is too simple and obsolete. History around each challenge are way to detailed compare to the actual incident and technical detail. I just dont quite understand other reviewer rating this book with 5 stars.
4,"Great book, and fun also!","I liked Hackers Challenge volume 1, and volume 2 carries on.It is lively, entertaining, and makes you think.This book is very real-world.I loved it and had fun reading it."
3,SPREADING THEIR WINGS,"Very short, intense tale about a 10-year-old boy's discovery of his aging grandfather and bird lore. Resentful of being temporarily abandoned by his parents with an crusty old man he never met before, Sammy spends two days finding out about himself as he starts to grow up. After his unsuccessful attempt to run away, he grudgingly helps the old man care for a wounded crane. The boy is not at all likeable, but he learns to take into consideration both creatures and people besides himself, as he comes to respect the winged kingdom which his grandfather loves. In so doing, he comes to appreciate the old man, who finally addresses the boy by his name."
1,terrible,"very poor quality musicquite offensivenot suitable for younger audiencenot entertaining at allunlike the great album by the sugar free allstars containing ""tiger in your backyard"""
2,Not the best Bodum press,"I needed a new Bodum press after my last one broke, and thought this would be good one since it seemed to be more durable than the others, with plastic encasing around the glass insert. Ironically, I ended up breaking the glass insert because it always gets stuck within the plastic encasing, and then the rubber edges start to roll down, etc. If you rinse the press, water becomes trapped between the encasing and the glass insert, never drying fully unless you remove the glass insert, and also dripping into the coffee when pouring. I will buy another Bodum press, but probably one with the metal encasing vs. rubber or plastic."
5,"tough, yet stylish","the press works as all French press coffee makers, the cladding protects the often fragile glass from the granite counters. We like the red accents which compliment other small canisters in the kitchen."
1,Bodum Young Press,"This press does not seal at the top, so the vapors escape and does not make good coffee. I was very disappointed with this brand and afterwards was told by others they've had the same problem."
3,First Time User Not So Impressed,"This press works well and is fairly easy to use. It's attractive. It's fragile. I've used it everyday for three months. Some thoughts: (1) I think you're merely getting stronger coffee because the beans are immersed longer than with a drip. I didn't detect anything special because the oils were free from filtration. (2) Clearing it is a pain because you will have to unscrew the filter mechanism to get all the grinds out of the screen. (3) Unless you're going to buy a burr grinder or grind your beans charcoal size, you will have ""coffee dust"" in your brew. I'm sure someone will recommend buying a burr grinder but if you look at the reviews of those grinders on Amazon you'll see that only the most expensive ones get better ratings. In short the press was ok but I'm not sure the coffee is worth the extra effort."
1,tastes like rubber,I love the bodum. but the plastic they used for the top is different and with the boiling water it releases something that adds a rubbery smell and taste to the coffee. I have to figure out how to return it.
2,Smallish,"Nice design, carafe was well protected with the surrounding plastic. Ended up returning the item because of the size. Thirty four ounces seems a lot, but it's three mugs of coffee, which don't cut it around our house. Unfortunately the properly sized carafe is $50, and with glass breakage a likely result at some point, it becomes a pricey option. The cost of good coffee, I suppose."
4,Works as intended,"So far so good. Easy to disassemble for cleaning. Rubberized bottom makes for stable feel on my counter top. All in all it's fun trying out French press coffee, it was cheap too which doesn't hurt."
2,Cold coffee,"The plastic does not keep the coffee hot long enough to enjoy a second cup, and even cools off the very first cup. The lid cracked after a few uses (even though I was careful to stir the coffee and not make it difficult to push down)."
5,I love it!,"I wasn't sure how I'd like a coffee press, but it tastes great! Of course, it takes alittle longer to brew, but the results are worth it. The directions are clear and no problems. I'd recommend it to anyone."
3,Good but small,"If this were only bigger, Id love it. Its small, and itsa little difficult with the glass piece that comes out. I find it a little flimsy and feel like I could have bought a better one for $10 more or so. Disappointed"
2,Poor Design,"I am very disappointed in this product, not what I would expect from a Bodum. This product consists of a glass beaker piece, the plunger, and a rubbery holder with the handle (the brown/red part). Moisture gets trapped between the glass and the rubber of the outer holder since it forms a tight seal around the glass with no air vents to escape. So you always have to take it apart after use. I have Bodum glass and chrome french presses that are much better.That being said, it's probably suitable for camping or something where you need a bit of ruggedness."
4,Bodum Coffee Press,"I bought this as a gift for my boyfriend as I don't drink coffee. The 34-ounce size works really well for two or three ""normal"" sized cups of coffee. I love how easy it is to clean and that it is all dishwasher safe. The black and red plastic sleeve actually has plastic windows around the glass container - I originally thought that it had holes where it was clear. This helps as an insulator!Overall, I think he is pleased with the item. Now we just have to find some coffee bean that he likes!"
5,Good and sturdy.,"I like this press. It has a nice feel to the handle and I like the way the glass is enclosed by the rubber and plastic on the outside but can be removed and cleaned or replaced as needed. Also, coffee tastes good from it. Like all presses, there is a minimal amount of residue in bottom of coffee cup after pouring a cup that is from the bottom of the press. Oh well, it is very simple and easy though."
4,Great for morning coffee,"I would have given 5 stars IF the item arrived in pristine condition. One of the clear windows on the sleeve was cracked, but since it doesn't affect how the coffee is made, I decided it was more important for me to have a coffee maker than to have a pretty coffee maker. The resulting coffee, when using six heaping scoops of ground coffee and adding boiling water (I know it says you shouldn't, but that's how presses work...), AND allowing the coffee to steep for at least 4 minutes (I let it go for six for a little extra kick)is about as good as coffee gets without spending a fortune on exotic or high-end coffees. Bodum sure seems to know what they are doing."
2,good flavor gets cold too fast,"the coffee is rich and consistent from the press, but it isnt hot when serving because you have to steep it for about 4 min and you cant put boiling water in the beaker to begin with... i would not recomend this product to anyone unless you like lukewarm coffee"
1,Press needs to be boxed.,"My press arrived from Amazon with a broken side panel, completely detached and unable to pop it back on. All clear plastic is scuffed as well. Many other Bodum presses come in boxes, why not this one? Is it to prove how ""durable"" this one is? Guess again, Bodum."
1,Bodum coffee press,"This product was wrapped in bubble wrap with a big sticker ""fragile"". Not a nice presentation to give as a gift -- no box, no proper wrapping. Not even a good way to ship it as it was not secure, rolling around inside a box with other things. Since it is a gift I cannot remove the bubble wrap to see if it has cracks or chips in it. What a disgrace and an embarrassing way to present a gift! Where's the box? Where are the instructions for the device? Some value?!"
4,Great product,"This was my first experience with a coffee press and I must say it went well. The only complaint I have with this is it appears that moisture can get inside the double walls, which concerns me a tiny bit but otherwise thought it was great. Had very little settiment in the bottom of my cup which was also great cause I have heard that can be a real problem. Can't wait to use it more."
5,a nice treat,"It seems that some will always find a reason to complain.Now that I have been brewing coffee with this Bodum press for 2 weeks I honestly do not understand how anyone can say it is cheap or adds an undesirable rubber flavor.This press is amazing. Four minutes in the microwave to boil half a pot, four minutes to brew with coursely ground beans of your choice and I have two of the hottest most satisfying cups of coffee I have ever tasted. Not bitter or harsh like ****bucks can be. I highly recommend this item."
2,Very thin glass,"I do love a french press, but I need one that is not so easily broken. The glass is very thin and very fragile. Mine broke after a couple of months. The glass sets in a rubber like holder that is not easy to get in and out of. If you do purchase this item wash the press as one piece and drain upside down to get the water out of the holder's base, do not try to remove the glass."
4,Star Wars Sleeping Bag,The questionaire does not reflect my satisfaction with the Star Wars sleeping bag since it's not really a toy. I was pleasantly surprised at the softness and quality of this product. My grandson curled right up in it and fell asleep.
5,"Know the Person, Know the Psychology","Harvey Mindess has written one of the most important introductory books on psychological theory. Certainly other books cover more theories and/or cover them in greater depth. But Harvey's book examines the lives of each of the major theorists he considers, and demonstrates how those lives impacted their theories.This book includes numerous amusing and touching anectdotes, and helps to bring the theorists alive. It also summarizes each theory cogently. This work is witty, concise, and written for the general reader. Although difficult to find, it is a rare gem and not to be missed by *anybody* with an interest in psychology. Five stars for both concept and writing style.(If you enjoyed this review, please leave positive feedback. You can read my other reviews by clicking on the ""more about me"" link at the top of this review. Thanks!)"
1,Hated It!!!,"This product gets two thumbs down!!! It's hard to put together unless you have a lot of thumb strength. Then, once it was finally put together correctly, it leaked. Don't buy this. Pay the extra money for one that really works."
5,Time saver,The roll and go replacement hose was easy to use - and it makes cleaning up easy as well. Just make sure you attach the end with the longer piece of the smaller hose to the part that attaches to the paint can (made the mistake of doing it the opposite way and it doesn't specify in the directions). The roll and go cuts painting time at least in half. Since I tend to not use enough paint to fully cover using the roller and pan it takes care of that problem for me too!
1,Died After 2 Weeks,"I had this in my new AMD Phenon Quad Core 9500 with the XFX Motherboard. It had all of the connections I needed. But, it died after 2 weeks in the system. AMAZON was great and refunded my money. I went with a Antec Brand Powersupply this time."
2,not convenient,"I tried similar product by Summer Infant and really liked it. But Neat Solutions potty toppers are cheaper, so I decided to give them a try. Big, big mistake. The seat covers are much smaller compare to Summer Infant covers, so it;s more difficult to position them on the toilet seat. The adhesive strips don't work well. If you position the cover seat properly and your toddler seats still - they do their job. Next time I am going to order Summer Infant again."
4,So convenient...,"I've bought these for the second time and I know I'll continue to buy them for awhile...Pros:-not bulky (take as many as you want)-waterproof (if there are drops on the seat, they won't leak through)-stay put (I use them for my 2-1/2 year old and I've used them myself and I've never had a problem w/ them shifting out of place... I think your kid would have to be REALLY squirmy for them to move)Cons:-I wish the covers and the little pieces of plastic that you remove to stick it down were somehow flushable... it would make it that much more convenient..."
5,"All I Can Say Is ""Oh... My... Goodness.""","This follow-up mystery to If Walls Could Talk deserves no less than five and a half stars in my opinion. As with the first book, these characters are so real. The situations are so not what I would experience on day to day settings, but I feel I'm right there in the mix. Vincent puts us in the character's heads, and I like that! I can't wait for the next book, and I would really like to see these series turned into movies... soon!"
3,A bit too silly even for kids,"This is a story of a grandmother, mother and daughter who conquer their fears of spiders and crawl under their house to catch one in a jar. The goal is to take the spider to Billy, a little boy who laughed at Caitlin's fears. The text is a little long for the simple plot, which I and my little niece both thought a bit silly. The line drawings are not that interesting. There are a lot of much better books out there for the 5-8 crowd"
1,It was bad,This book was hard to follow and it had no scipt line what so ever the book was just plain uneventful. Just like the Detroit Lions!
5,Works like it's supposed to work,"I have one 55 gallon aquarium and one 15 gallon aquarium inhabited by 6 aquatic turtles. Before I discovered this product, my aquarium would get fouled up, stinky, and murky within a month after a complete water change, even with the filters running full tilt. Now, I can literally go indefinitely without a water change as long as I keep the filters clean and running. This stuff is a must if you own aquatic turtles, just add some every time you do a water change or a filter cleaning."
3,for ABS (anti lock brake systems) ?,"Wow, really nice details on the dimensions of the bottle.How about telling us more about the product inside, like is it formulated for ABS ? :)"
1,Terrible product,"I cannot speak for PC users, but this product was absolutely worthless on my Mac. Although my computer met all system requirements and I followed the directions, the adapter simply did not work at all. The software included is amateurish and buggy, no user manual was included (despite advertisements to the contrary), and the read-me files contained on the CD were unhelpful and written in broken English. I contacted QVS tech support for assistance, and they attempted to solve my Mac problem based on their (limited) knowledge of the Windows version, because they didn't have access to a Mac. It seemed that anyone with a basic working knowledge of computers would have been better suited to provide tech support. In short, stay far, far away!"
2,Not impressed... Waste of money...,"I bought this as a kite that I can fly on the go, but it's hard to fly in lighter winds. It will only fly in constant stronger winds. It won't even fly reliably in stronger variable winds. I should have just bought a regular Delta kite, as this thing is useless and I can't ever get it to fly for more than a few seconds at a time until it falls to teh ground. Do yourself a favor and don't waste your money."
1,Looks good.... when its not spiraling to the ground and crashing,Worst kite I have ever used. Starts to go up nice and easy and just when at the perfect height plummets to the ground and crashes. Tryed another thinking it was a bad kite.... nope jumk. We had the dollar store kites up in no time and this piece of trash just spiraled to the ground. Both of them acted the same. We also bought the rec baron style and it worked perfectly to. This kite is for the worms as it does not even reach where the birds fly.
4,kite review,The kite is a lot of fun. The company needs to include more string. It flys well is pretty stiff winds. It wants to loop d loop on the short string.
2,Doesn't fly well for us,We bought 2 of these in different colors after reading the positive reviews on the flying ability. They didn't fly well for us at all. Our winds are a little irregular and gusty at times and the changes seemed to collapse the kites and down they would come. We are going to try a different kite design this year.
4,Hot Dog and a Smile! : ),"I purchased this for my Girlfriend for Christmas, haven't given it to her yet. Anyway, Nice Tin Sign very creative and make a nice addition to your wall or collection of Coca-Cola. It did come a Little bent on one edge but nothing very noticeable, and I'm quite sure it was the UPS' fault! Anyway, Its a nice size not too big, not too small, but just right lol."
4,"Review of Vince Gill's, ""When Love Finds You.""","I have really enjoyed this Vince Gill material [CD]. Most of the music on this release I had not heard widely on radio programs. Very traditional country music from Vince. The guy sings with serious emotion. The vendor did a good job of getting the CD to me in ""like new"" condition and was sent very timely. I would use this vendor again."
4,True Vince Gill,"If you're a fan, this CD is good. As usual, you take ALL of the choices when buying a CD."
3,Good,"I bought this CD for ""Go Rest High on that Mountain"" which is great song writing and singing by Mr. Gill."
5,I love this CD!,This is a wonderful CD if you are just falling in love or getting over someone. Vince Gill has the smoothest voice and there is a lot of variety on the CD--fast songs along with the slow songs that keep it from being too sappy.
4,A voice from heaven,"I was new to Vince Gill when i bought the european version of this album. The UK version have to bonus tracks Aint Nothing Like the real thing( Duet with Gladys Knight) and the Eagles cover I Cant tell you way. But the rest is the same.Track 1 Whenever You Come around is if i you hybrid country with sweet lullabye music. Its also a gospel feel over the tunes but Vince Gill has a voice so clean and powerfull that it just hit you in your soul. I like the ballad`s best, but the more tempo tunes Like What the Cowgirls do Track 4, still kicks ass man. Track 7 South side of Dixie is the ultimate track if you want to take a swing. Its produced by Don Was which has created a clean and smooth soundpicture all trough the CD. All in all this is music you want when its cold outside. It makes you warm inside. More words to describe the CD is pointless. When the words stop, the music takes over.. A voice from heaven."
3,Over-rated,"I personally feel that Vince Gill is over-rated as a country singer. It's knda like rooting for Pac 10 & Big 10 football , it's okay, if you don't know any better.I bought this CD as a gift for my wife, who does love it !"
3,Way Too Many Ballads,"Eleven songs, eight ballads? C'mon Vince! Although I do like ""Whenever You Come Around"" & Gill's tribute to his brother, ""Go Rest High on That Mountain"", there are just way too many ballads for me. However, the up-tempo tunes, ""What the Cowgirls Do"", ""South Side of Dixie"" & the Fleetwood Mac-style ""You Better Think Twice"", along with the two previously mentioned ballads, still make this a must-have collection in my opinion."
1,Great voice. But put more info about CD,Bought this CD just for the song Go Rest High On that Mountain. A man I was raised with died and I do picture video's for myself and friends. I knew that song was perfect. The CD lets me rip it and burn it to other CD. But it will not let me put the song in the Windows Movie Maker because of copyrights. No where on this CD did they say it couldn't be used for that purpose. I've made wedding videos using other artist and no problem. So if you want to use it in anyway except burning or listening to it don't bother. A total waste of money.
3,Comforting Song,"I bought this album, ""When Love Finds You,"" for the last song: ""Go Rest High On That Mountain."" For me it expresses the loss of a loved one in comforting terms. I think it is because of the value given to the person gone."
5,The Miraculous Journey of Edward Tulane,I have purchased this book for all of my Grandchildren and then have to beg them to put it down. They read it over and over again. One of the Authors Best.
4,Wonderful book!,"This was a great read as a summer activity with the kids. DiCamillo takes you on a journey with Edward Tulane, a china doll rabbit, as he learns lessons about loving others and being loved. It was a great in-between-ages book since my oldest (who is 8) is currently into books such as Fablehaven and the 13th Reality. I didn't want her bored, but I also needed something young enough for my 6 and 7 yr olds. It was perfect, they loved the description, and characters, and I loved the good moral lesson taught in the story. Everytime I put the book away they begged me to keep reading. My 8 yr old also wants our next book to be from this same Author, so I believe it was a hit."
5,I Finished it Walking Home to the Library,"What a beautiful little book this was. Great illustrations, it told the sad story of a little china rabbit named Edward Tulane who learns to love despite the pain.It made me get all misty eyed. Also you can tell the quality of the characters based on how they treated the toy.He learned to stop being arrogant and open his heart, not an easy thing to do, but a good thing to do if you want to be complete. It's all about compassion, kindness, loving, doing the right thing, important things like that.And being kind to toys."
4,Good and easy to read,"Edward Tulane is an uncaring toy rabbit made out of china and rabbit fur who has never loved anyone but himself. His eleven year-old owner Abilene loves him very much but when she, her mother, and Edward go on a ship across the ocean to England, Edward is taken from Abilene by two boys. He is then stripped of his clothes and thrown into the water. He sinks to the bottom and for the first time in his life he feels something. Fear. Edward is rescued and travels from owner to owner and from place to place. During his journey he learns how to love, and then his heart is broken and vows never to love again. But he does.This is a charming book about love, hope, and a toy rabbit's journey home. I did not think that it was very sad, but some people might. Fans of animals and drama should read this book for sure."
5,Excellent - we loved it!,"I bought this book for a summer read with my ten year old twins and my five year old. We all enjoyed this so much. When softy Mom started to get choked up at the misfortunes in Edward's life, I'd pass the book off to the boys. We read the whole book aloud, keeping everyone's attention in two, one-hour sessions. We gave the book to my nine year old niece and received a call the very next day telling me how much she loved the book too! We laughed, we cried and we'll remember this one for a long, long time. What more can you ask?"
5,One of my favorite books,"This story is written for kids. The reading is easy and took me about an hour to finish. But it is a beautiful story that just moved me to keep reading. A great, clean, fun book. It's one of my favorite books."
5,Loved it,I read this to my six and seven yo boys and we all three just love it. Edward found love and his way back home.
5,absolutely charming,"This beautifully written story captivated everyone i have read it to, from my second grade class to my 80-year-old mother."
4,Engaging Story to Share with Your Children,"This is a sweet story with great illustrations that was perfect for me to share with my 7-year-old daughter. The story was engaging with mini-cliff hangers at the end of each chapter. Edward Tulane meets a variety of interesting characters on a journey that is at turns filled with despair, hope, and ultimately and always love. Enjoy and share with your children."
1,Disturbing,I am shocked that this book got so many positive reviews. I'm an adult (a teacher) and found this book to be very upsetting. I was going to include it in my classroom library but my GT kids can be very sensitive and wouldn't be able to handle the abuse and the voilence. This is not appropriate for young children.
1,"With all that brings us down in real life, do we need fictional misery too???","I bought this book some years ago to read with my little girl. Little did I realize reading this book to the end would be like being trapped in a sad, depressing, dismal nightmare that becomes more terrible with every chapter.The writing is excellent, the illustrations beautiful. This is fiction after all, given the authors talent it could be anything, uplifting, cheerful, hopeful. Why on earth would the author give us this, in kids book no lessReading This story was about as much fun and as good for your soul as going to your local animal shelter and looking in the eyes of all the dogs you can't save.I recommend spare your kids the heartache"
3,what was so Miraculous about it?,"I got the book Edward Tulane for Easter. Read it in an hour. It really was a disappointment. I loved the other DiCamillo books, but what happened here? The lesser characters are lonely when we meet them and lonely when we leave them. The ending is oh! so predictable. Abilene deserved to have lost the rabbit, how did she help him understand love in the first place? It just did not hit the right buttons of my emotions. I sympatized more with the other characters than with Edward himself."
3,Not My Style,"I didn't care for the down-tone of this book. A good story, but a bit heavy for escapist children's reading."
2,Such the disappointment,"I had high hopes for this book since I really, really liked The Tale of Despereaux. But I found the story of Edward Tulane so simplistic that it just wasn't worth the reading. I noticed that almost all of the people that Edward encountered were adults who treated him like a real person. Interesting, but not a very likely scenario for a toy rabbit. It was easy reading, and an easy read-aloud. Parts were sweet, but mostly it was very predictable. Very nice pictures, though."
3,So heart-wrenching,"This book has many sweet moments, but has a greater proportion of scary, sad, or even heart-wrenching moments. The very last page lifts the story to a cheerful note, but one can't help still feeling the ache of so many losses and heartaches that are the main focus of the book. I fear that a child reading this would find just chapter after chapter of losing those you love, and that sad feeling would linger, as it has for me."
5,A Great Read Aloud,"I am a big fan of this book! I read it to my second graders and they love it. Yes it has dark parts, yes there is loss and pain, but the journey Edward goes through, and the way his character changes for the better is very powerful. This is a life changer!"
5,Edward,"I already sent in a review that it was a Christmas gift, and it was received just before Christmas as a gift"
5,WE APPLAUDED AT THE END!,The kids and I read this book in one day over holiday break. We LOVED it! What a beautiful message about life!
5,A classic. A delight. Absolutely enchanting.,"This is an absolutely beautiful tale. It will break your heart, warm your soul and make you smile. Words really can't express how much I love this book. It will always hold a place of honor on our bookshelf. If you have even the smallest glimmer of sentimentality in your heat, have a fondness for The Velveteen Rabbit, have a penchant for love stories (for this is truly a love story...), or just simply enjoy reading an amazingly well crafted story deftly told by an able artist then please consider gifting yourself with the joy that is Edward Tulane."
3,Kind of dark for kids,"I wanted to like this book. I truly did. I love Kate DiCamillo, and there is something so precious about a selfish little rabbit doll. And I do appreciate what DiCamillo wanted to do with this story.The only problem is that this came out as rather, well, dark and depressing and I just don't know how comfortable I am reading this to small children. There is absolutely no happiness in this book whatsoever until one finally reaches the bittersweet ending. Maybe I'm just this person in lala land who likes happy stories, but I found this too harsh for its intended age group. Heck, even I was depressed after reading it.Still, DiCamillo is a fantastic writer and the story goes along in a very intelligent manner with fascinating characters.So... if a kid can put up with a dark fairy tale, this is probably worth a read."
1,Disturbing,"I read the first few chapters of this book standing in a book store. They were beautifully written. I bought the book for my 7 year old son. Fortunately, I read it first before giving it to him. I will not let him read it. The book takes a disturbing religious turn 3/4 of the way through, with the rabbit strung up as a scarecrow (actually its ears are nailed) to a cross, waiting to be saved. Several of the characters in the story are abusive to a point that is not acceptable to me in a children's book (a young boy being slapped in the mouth). There are plenty of good books for children on the market. This isn't one of them."
2,"Tender Story, Terrible Violence","The title, the presentation and the illustrations are most inviting. The story itself is appealing in its sweet message of a self-absorbed toy rabbit finding love for others through a series of hardships. However, I cannot imagine sharing this story with a child. Filled with horrible violence and tragedy, it is what nightmares are made of! Every hardship Edward encounters is at the hands of an extremely cruel person; little boys strip him of his clothing and he is sent to the depths of the ocean floor, he is buried in a garbage dump, literally kicked off a moving train, nailed to a cross, his head smashed on a counter. Yes, he feels the love of someone before, during or after each of these events, but this does not do enough to justify the violence. This is NOT a book for children!!"
3,not the best literature,"My daughter needed it for the school. didn't like the history, I think is too sad for little children. But have a positive teaching."
5,THE BEST BOOK EVER,I think anybody who is questioning to read this should. This book helps you find love. Katie did a great job keeping me reading. The ending is great though you might cry of happy tears! I think it is for all ages. It will help you find love that you have never found before. The lesson to learn is to love someone always it will get you through life. So you should read this book.
4,This book made me cry.,"I am a teacher. I purchased this book to add to my library of books for the students use but I am now rethinking my decision. I absolutely adore this book, it's well written and incredibly smart for the age level. I could see the writing style encouraging students to use advanced vocabulary in their own writing. I do think, however, that this book should not be given to students of this age level without a disclaimer. Many students of this age are accustomed to happy go lucky stories and this is not one of them-at almost every turn of the page, the protagonist feels defeated. I would not want my students to dislike this story simply because it is not what they expected. I've had this happen with other stories. Just a thought."
5,only half way througn an love it- True Classic,Written in true DiCamillo style- I am half way through and in love with this story! If she doesn't win award I will be shocked! You must read this!
5,I Loved this Book it was Awsome,"I am in 6th grade and our teacher read this book to us. I really liked it so I think you should read ""The Miraculous Journey of Edward Tulane."" I liked the action and the adventure. One of my favoeite parts was when Edward first got lost and how he got lost. Another thing I liked was when Edward almost got killed. The charicters were belivible. But the ending wasen`t the best because it came so fast. However you should read this book."
5,A most enjoyable read,The local librarian recommended this book for our 7 year old daughter. I was convinced it was a good book when several other patrons who happen to be there eyes lit up when this book was mentioned. We were not disappointed. Both my husband and I took turns reading the book in its' entirety. I found myself looking forward to the next evening when I would read another chapter or two.
5,A Magical Meaningful Journey for All Ages,"I had just started reading this book out loud to my son, when my mother sat down next to us. She overheard the story reading and began to listen. When I was finished reading the first two chapters and was putting the book away to continue on another night, she asked me to please include her in the next evening's reading. She was mesmerized by the story...and so it continued. I read the story to my son and my mother...and the 3 of us...all different generations fell in love with the enchanting tale of The Miraculous Journey of Edward Tulane."
5,Our Family's favorite book!,My family enjoyed this book so very much. We all agree that it is her finest.
4,Miraculous Storyteller and Illustrator,"There has not been a more beloved story than Edward's journey in a very long time. Kate Dicamillo is a savvy storyteller. At first, one might predict the next twist or turn in her story, reader beware. Her ending is reminiscent of ""The Little House,"" by Virginia Lee Burton, it's easily over-looked here. Bagram Ibatoulline's artwork is beautifully synchronous with the story. His work is often sublime here, but he is not afraid to hold back. He is worthy of the ""Molly Bang Award."" Oh, and it's a great kids book, too."
2,Not DiCamillo's best work,This book was very strange. My son loves DiCamillo's work so I bought this for his birthday. He was not interested in the least after a couple of chapters. We trudged on. The book had very strange parts - Edward being nailed to the cross!?! And it left many ends undone. What happened to Bryce? I think it is creative - but is too strange for children to wrap their brains around. I liked her other books much better.
2,Mean spirited.,"Quite simply, all the adult characters in this book are downright mean. What's with the dark gloomy tone of this book for children?? No thanks. On lessons of life and love, I'll take ""The Giving Tree"" any day."
1,NOT a children's book!,"DiCamillo is a talented author, but PLEASE know that this is not a children's book, and certainly not for the age range given -- unless reading about a four-year-old child coughing up blood and then dying seems appropriate to you. This is an intense story filled with the worst part of life -- child abuse, heartless adults, poverty, abandonment. The kind, caring people in the story are consistently victimized.That each chapter is more heartbreaking and horrifying than the last really makes me wonder what the author and publisher were thinking; this should not have been positioned as a children's book. And finally, I'm disappointed that DiCamillo so freely ""borrowed"" the premise from Rachel Field's classic ""Hitty: Her First 100 Years"" -- now that IS a book for children."
5,the miraculous journey of edward tulane,I really liked The Miraculous Journey Of Edward Tulane. It's really sad in the middle of the book and beginning of the book. I really liked it. by Devon
5,The book version of the movie,"I saw the movie called AWAKENINGS (with Robt. DeNiro and Robin Williams) and was intrigued, so I bought this book by Sachs. I was not disappointed. The book is so much more thorough than the movie , and I must say...much more technical.Infact, the book is so technical that it could take the reader quite a while to decipher all the medical terms included & to read the entire book quickly. Take your time with this one.As a non-medical student, it took me a while to read through this book, but it was worth it! Also, the other good thing is that the book gives a good ""encyclodepia"" of all the medical terms in the book's NOTES."
3,Awakenings,"This story is fascinating! I watched the movie and then wanted to learn more, so I bought the book. The stories really make you appreciate your life.This book, however, has a lot of medical jargon, so it is hard to follow at times. Also, Dr. Sacks writes in a professional manner. It isn't like a memoir or a typical novel that you would read. It can be had to follow."
3,Repetitive,"After I read ""The Man who Mistook his Wife for a Hat,"" I was very interested in reading this book, which was supposed to be the one that made Dr. Sacks famous. I was a little disappointed, though, to find that it was too repetitive. Every story contained the same ""entrancement, awakened, blocked"" theme, and after about three or four case histories, I stopped reading. Oliver Sacks is a great author, and a very compassionate doctor, but to me, this didn't seem to be one of his best books."
3,Awakenings,"In spite of all the praise that this book has received from other readers, all the glowing reviews it has garnered, and its' scientific value, which I am not qualified to either laud or argue, I found it to be a great disappointment. I don't like saying this for Oliver Sacks has long been one of my favorite writers. In fact, when I purchased this book, it was the only one of his that I did not already own: I could hardly wait to open its' cover. But, high expectations notwithstanding, it fell flat. Whereas, in Sacks' other works, the individuals featured in his case histories seemed so real, so fully fleshed out, that they literally walked across the pages, in Awakenings, it was as if they never awakened at all. Sorry."
2,Kaffir Lime Leaves,"There is no comparison to the real thing. I purchased a Kaiffir Lime Tree online. Sorry, but I don't know the web address; however, you can Google it. The tree cost me about $40. When I got the tree in the mail, it was only about six inches tall. I put it in a sunny corner about two years ago and it grew like crazy. Now, it's almost four feet tall. Get yourself a big container and plenty of potting soil, and tou'll will have Kaffir lime leaves for a lifetime."
5,Stuffed Skunk Scores!,The Skunk was large (good for hugging) and seemed well assembled clean and plush enough. It will be a hit with anybody looking for a non stinky skunk!
5,"Interesting, but lacking in some context.","I am an admirer of Weitekamp's excellent work at the Smithsonian Air & Space Museum as Curator of the Social and Cultural History of Spaceflight. Which is why I found this book a little puzzling, as it failed to give an adequate degree of social and cultural context to the area she is discussing. The book collects together all of the facts, and isn't inaccurate. However I found a much superior assessment of the ""Mercury 13"" program in Burgess and French's bookInto That Silent Sea: Trailblazers of the Space Era, 1961-1965 (Outward Odyssey: A People's History of S). In one extraordinary chapter, they capture the true cultural, historical and social context of this program far better than this entire book-length treatment. They also contrast the Soviet women in space program very well.Nevertheless, I would still recommend this book as a very interesting read into a fascinating time in American history, and congratulate the author on her great research."
3,Best of Ultimate Springbreak?,"Having seen the ultimate springbreak video, I can tell you that this is not the best of it. Nothing breaks the monotony of the topless flashing. There is almost no bottomless flashes. If you are going to buy one of the two volumes, buy the second one, is much better."
3,"Good, but not the best","Best of Ultimate Spring Break, Vol. 1 contains all what you expect from Girls Gone Wild: Pretty (and drunk) girls, a lot of flashes, some nice kisses, but this is not one the best GGW Series. If you're looking for the best, the favorites are the Uncensored Girls Gone Wild Vol. 1 (All Real) and Girls Gone Wild Vol. 2 (College Co-Eds). These titles go far, far away, with more explicit (and hotter) scenes."
3,Check out SPRING BREAK IN THAILAND!,"So I've been a GGW fan for a couple of years, but I'm totally hooked on this new ""Wild Girls Thailand"" DVD- wow, these Asian babes are sizzling! Talk about babes, beaches, and bikinis! You guys gotta check it out!"
3,ITS OK...,"IF YOURE 14 AND HAVE NEVER SEEN A GIRL NAKED, THEN I WOULD RECCOMMEND THIS (OR ANY OF THE OTHER PARTS OF THE SERIES)TO YOU...OTHERWISE, FOR THOSE OF US POST-ADOLESCENT MALES WHO HAVE A VALID (OR INVLAID) DRIVER'S LICENSE FOR THAT MATTER...LOOK TO CHEAPER, LESS EXPENSIVE PORN (HALF THE TIME, EVEN FREE)...PEACE AND CHICKEN GREASE..."
3,Replacement for User Manual,"Other than going over features, this guide told me very little the owner manual didn't already. A great replacement for lost owner manual, but that's about it."
5,the missing manual,i bought a used nikon F3 that came with out a manual and this book is all i need to understand and use this camera in auto or manual.
2,not worth it,"It is really sad, I ordered 5 of these in different colors, and most of each in every container fell apart before I could even hang them on the tree.The decorations are very pretty, I received them really fast, colors are true to web pics......but I now have to find my glue gun to glue each of them back together. The price is NOT cheap enough to force me to have to do that.I am sadly disappointed."
4,"Learn Sense of Self, Control and Freedom","Will help those who struggle with a sense of self. The 4 ""rules to live by,"" if you will, could be viewed as basic but can and help to change your life if you are vested in learning the techniques and aquiring a stronger sense of self. Highly recommend especially for those who struggle with who they were taught to be Vs. Who they actually are. Learn to rid of guilt, learn from mistakes and move on. Learn to trust yourself and be who you want to be.All in all a great lesson though I disagree with some of the wording or interpretation of words."
5,Personal Freedom,"This book is very well written and easy to understand. It is a quick read, and I will reread it often to keep the material fresh. The message is simple, yet very profound. It truly opened my eyes and my heart to an awareness that had made a huge difference in the way I treat myself. Most of us don't realize how we are silently killing our own souls by the way we think; this book helped me to realize and change a thought process that released negativity I didn't know was harboring in my soul. As a result, it freed me and opened the path to a higher level of enjoyment and satisfaction in my life. I will purchase many more copies as gifts for friends ... what great joy it will bring me to know that I gave someone I love the ability to be kinder to themselves, along with the tools to truly enjoy life!"
4,Interesting..,I liked reading this book and feel as if there is definitely some truth to it - practice these four agreements and you will live a better life. However it's also harder than it looks! I printed out the four agreements and keep them in my wallet - and try really hard to own it. I'm also reading a New Earth which I feel has some similarities so I feel like I'm on my way to a better me! :)
4,The Four Agreements,"Yes, the ideas presented in the book may seem ""simple"" and ""obvious,"" but I think that's the point. Those on the path to self awareness sometimes make things a little more complicated than they are. If you keep these four guidelines close to your heart, all the answers to your questions will come to you when the time is right.As to those who are reviewing this book so negetively after reading it, I just have one piece of advice: refer to Agreement number 2."
1,Reviews may be more interesting than the book,"Perhaps the startling number of rave reviews for this book is the clearest indication of our (societies) spiritual deficit.The four agreements seem like excellent common sense, what more to say?Some very informative reviews on here and, on reflection, I have decided to save myself some time and money and not read this book.Am I a fool, or am I displaying great wisdom?"
5,GREAT BOOK,THIS BOOK IS WONDERFUL TO ADD TO ANYONES COLLECTION. IT HAS GREAT INFORMATION THAT IS VERY USEFUL. I WOULD RECOMMEND TO ANYONE WHO LOVES TO READ.
4,Promtness,"The book hadn't come in over 3 weeks so I contacted the seller and they sent a new one directly to my home and had it within 3 days. Things can go wrong with the mail, I really appreciated their quick response, the book was under 5 dollars so couldn't be tracked."
5,Great service,"Great service as in fast, great customer service, and great product, I loved it exactly what I was hoping it would be and more. This book can change your life as you now know it to be. Thank you so much and I will use you again and recomment you to others."
5,The 4 Agreements,"This is an excellent book that is a quick read. I purchase it in quantity to provide to managers in our organzation that complete a 360 degree processes, or as a gift for participation in management training. It provides key insights into elements essential for contentment with self."
3,A bit simplistic,"Well, I definitely think this has a lot of useful pointsUnfortunately, these are points that I already knew about or that are (or should be) obvious to most peopleThe book isn't very detailed and has very simple, easily-constructed messages about how to live your lifeA bit too simplistic for this complex modern worldStill, not completely uselessWorth reading if available, but not worth purchasing"
3,Pretty good,"For the first time in a long time I moved and inspired by this book. In my opinion this book was written in the spirit of"" the alchemists"" and ""celestine prophecy"". Very enjoyable and awe inspire ring."
5,This book can change your life.,"If you have an open mind, and are willing to accept new ideas and beliefs, then this book can change your life. This book has changed my way of viewing situations and things around me,and even saved my parents marriage. I can't understand how anybody could give this book anything below five stars, but if your looking for a way of living a better life, then this book is for you."
1,Returned book the very next day. Pass on this one!,"If I could give this zero stars I would. Aside from the fact that the author writes in an annoying 8th grade vocabulary, the book is unbearably repetitive. I purchased the book to see what all the ""fuss"" was about. While Toltec Wisdom is of great interest to me, this book is not. Truly, it was written in a strange Hawaiian Pidgin-like language (not spelled Pigeon)."
2,open-minded analysis,"I have three words to sum up the book, WASTE OF MONEY! If you are desperately seeking help and guidance and can ignore all reason and logic you may enjoy the book, also you may want to seek professional psychological help. If you think critically or dislike someone imposing their outlandish beliefs on you then please don't waste your money."
5,The Four Agreements,I returned this book. A friend had previously given me a copy of the exact book. Thanks for the great service!
3,In the Middle,"This book was added to my collection after being invited to a local monthly book club. My husband read it too and we plan to attend the discussion together this week.The Four Agreements, provides typical self-help and personal growth advice. ""Toltec"" wisdom reiterates positive thinking and confidence in yourself. The dream/reality issue is something each individual would have to read about and determine how they interpret Ruiz and his ancient beliefs.It was a ""quick read"" and an opportunity to reinstate my focus on the good and positive words I say to others, as well as myself."
2,dissappointing,"This book was recommended to me by a friend, but i didn't like it. There was nothing new in it. The same advice has been better expressed by other writers."
2,Good advice if you can dig through the double speak,"The four pieces of advice that he gives are quite good. But, my goodness why all the mysticism? It's like buying a pizza and being told that you have received something incredibly important. Instead of a plain ole pizza, it's actually an ""Alien space orb brought forth to nourish your body with truth and hope"". But I guess that some people think that simple elegant ideas are 'deeper' if they are presented in a complex way....."
1,Seriously?,"I'm just going to quote a paragraph from the book, here, and let you decide for yourself.""Every human is a magician, and we can either put a spell on someone with our word or we can release someone from a spell. We cast spells all the time with our opinions. An example: I see a friend and give him an opinion that just popped into my mind. mind. I say, Hmmm! I see that kind of color in your face in people who are going to get cancer. If he listens to the word, and if he agrees, he will have cancer in less than one year. That is the power of the word.""(8th paragraph, Chapter 2)"
4,Cool,"I'm not much of a New Age fanatic, but this book was good. One of my favorite pieces of advice from the book was how you shouldn't worry about what other people think, because they live in their own distorted versions of reality and you have to create your own version to make it heaven. A cool book."
3,"Are self-limiting, fear-based beliefs making you unhappy?","The Four Agreements is brief treatise on how people create their own realities, and what they can do to improve that reality. Ruiz offers a blueprint for treating yourself justly and lovingly without trying to change other people. There is much here that is very good practical advice - especially the suggestions to cultivate some distance from your thoughts and other people's words and to replace old ""agreements"" with new beliefs about yourself. In fact, there's really nothing mystical or too ""out there"" in this common-sense book, and I see little, if anything, that would offend most Christians I know.The book is sometimes too obvious and too simplistic to be ultimately satisfying, however. When I read it, I kept thinking that this book embodies some of the worst characteristics of New Age writing. The writing is often stilted and the chapters repetitive. The book would be better had it been edited more tightly."
4,Agree for free,this was recommended to me by daniel norman. I was surprised because he is a fan of moives like jackass.Chapter 4 was particularly good.
4,It's that easy!,"This book is a very easy-flowing book with simple vocabulary so that anybody can read this book. For higher readers, it may sound a little redundant when you read it, but it's message is clear and simple. Ruiz uses a lot of the same words in one paragraph. But it is easy to understand his work. He provides an adequate number of examples for each agreement you must make within yourself in order to reach happiness and clarity with yourself. These examples are simple and easy to relate to. Read this book and follow its directions and you will see a different side to the world as soon as you finish and apply its concepts into your world."
4,The four agreements,"The CD is scratched and skips. I thought it was brand new, which it claimed to be, but somehow it is defective and therefore I can't listen but parts at a time so I gave up on it.Kind of a shame since it came highly recommended."
3,Eye opening,"Overall the book was very basic, most people told me that it would speak to me...it didn't. But it did put things into perspective and to get me started on my ""new"" track. I would recommend if you want to change your life (maybe that's over the top), if you want to change your thinking, I would suggest to start with this book and then go on to read, The Secret and the Master Key System. Though all these books are very different I believe they link the common concepts together nicely. =0)"
5,A Beautiful Philosophy,Book was in excellent condition and something I will keep and reread for a long time.Great way to live.
5,One of the top 3 most important books I've ever read.,This is a must-read for any sentient being who wishes to coexist peacefully in the world. Practical & practicable advice here.
3,Interesting ideas but I don't totaly agree with the agreements.,"The Four Agreements, by Don Miguel Ruiz, I believe the agreements have their merit but don't agree totally with their lessons. Charlotte Theile"
2,Not a book I'd recommend but some has some good truths,Good four agreements but a totally strange book. Seems to me like someone who has searched & experienced many spiritual paths and still seems lost!
4,Practical wisdom tradition for independent thinkers.,"I would recommend this book to anyone who has imagination, self-discipline, and a deep-seated love of wisdom traditions. I read some esoteric Toltec stuff years ago, but this is REAL advice that you can put into practice immediately. A perfect addition for anyone involved in personal or professional development."
5,Words of Wisdom,"Easy read. Easy to understand. Practice these four agreements and change your life. Very simple and powerful. As easy as following the rule ""if you don't have anything good to say about someone don't say anything""."
5,Pearls of Wisdom,Excellent pearls of wisdom for adult children. I recommend this book for everyone. I need to buy one for myself
4,a little slant,good.smooth reading.seems to cover several decades of ages of readers gifted to 20 s-things and 40 s-things and read with insight gained by 60 s-thing
3,Overrated,"After hearing so many rave reviews about this book, I decided to buy it. It is so over-rated. It isn't eloquent and it doesn't have a flow. It is a collection of great tips and insight, though. Don't expect to be captivated by Ruiz' writing. It won't happen. You can expect to pick up some gems along the way. Quick read with no rhythm."
2,"Nothing special, nothing new","It could just be the sophomoric writing style, but I didn't find anything remarkable in this book. There's nothing that I particularly DISagree with, but there's certainly nothing unique and profound. This was a waste of my time and money."
4,A moment of spiritual deepen,It is a book you can read with pleasure giving you moments of relaxing meditation. it is usefull if followed with trust and involvment.
2,Four Agreements,"I did not like this book at all. The principles are pretty common sense. He repeats himself excessively. The book is just a little out there for me with all this ""black magic."""
4,Worth Reading,"Ruiz's book is simple and straightforward, and easy to read. While the reader may not take every word literally, there is enough value and Toltec-based wisdom in the Four Agreements that I found the book good enough to give to a number of friends and business clients. Not revolutionary, but common sense thinking that bears some investigating and thought. Happy reading."
4,A good start to personal freedom,"Ruiz has an understanding of how we are impacted by the society we live in. I enjoyed reading the second agreement ""Don't take anything personally"" and the third agreement ""Don't make assumptions"". These are only two of the many ways we are stifled or suppressed. We always have a choice when confronted with these situations and our assumptions.You have no control of what comes into your mind; you only have control over how long you entertain that thought.But I think it might be more about self-acceptance. Because if we do accept ourselves we take away all the power of the negative external forces. Until we accept ourselves fully (physically, mentally and financially) external forces will have power over us.To gain more insight on personal freedom, another good read is, ""It's About You"" by E. S. Smith"
4,4 agreements,I am taking a class on the 4 agrrements. Very good and I don't have time to read the book so I listen on my way home from work. I am very satisfied with the CD.
5,Live them!,"If every person could live life according to the four agreements this would be a very different world! No longer would politicians make false promises. People would not take things, that don't even concern them, personally. We wouldn't make assumptions thus not being judgemental. And if everyone did their best what more could we ask?!!"
4,"I already reviewed this book, but I wanted to update it","My biggest complaint about this book was that the author offered little or no information about how to use this book in our everyday lives. I noticed that the author had commented on the book after I had reviewed it, describing how to put the book into practical use. I found this information very useful and wondered why he did not include this in his book. If he had included this in his book, I would have given it 5 stars instead of 4. The author should consider adding this info into the book when it is reprinted. The information appears on the Amazon page for the book, under the published reviews for the book."
5,The Four Agreements is an Excellent Book,Don Miguel Ruiz provides some excellent words of wisdom in his book The Four Agreements: A Practical Guide to Personal Freedom. All of the information is presented in a practical way that makes it enjoyable to read and also easy to remember. A great read for anyone looking to learn more about Toltec wisdom and how it can improve your life.
5,Best book to read and reread. Changed my life.,"I received this book as a gift over a decade ago, and have since reread it several times. I've also given it as a gift to at least 50 people. The wisdom is so incredibly easy to understand, yet it takes years of practice to really get it right...I hope I'm almost there!! I used to take things personally and assume things like it was natural. It's SO incredibly unnatural and was the cause of so much pain and drama. Don Miguel Ruiz, I am forever grateful to you for writing this book. You changed the course of my entire life for the better."
4,Life Changing,"There are an abundance of guides on the market promising to offer the information and guidance to truly change your life; yet few of them deliver the goods. I'm very happy to say that this book, ""The Four Agreements"" is far different from the standard, washed out guide found elsewhere and instead, offers up a truly comprehensive and detailed delivery of powerful strategies to achieving true personal freedom. I can't recommend it enough, and have directed many friends and family to this book so that they, too, could benefit from the wisdom found within its pages.I also recommendThe Mind-Made Prison: Overcoming Limiting Beliefs and Reaching your Goals, a breathtaking self-discovery guide that reveals some of the more powerful methods to overcoming limitations and living a fuller, happier and healthier life."
5,This book WILL change your life!,"This book is an excellent addition to my self-improvement book collection. All four agreements are helpful, but for me the two most vital are:1. Don't take anything personally2. Don't make assumptions.By following those two agreements I have changed the way I interact with people. I no longer take offense if someone treats me poorly. I don't wallow in self-pity wondering what I did wrong. I simply acknowledge that something else must be going on with them. It helps me have compassion for them instead of anger. It helps me move on instead of staying stuck focused on THEM. I believe this is one of the most important books someone can read."
2,Poorly written,"Admittedly, the tenets espoused by Ruiz are of some value, however, the problem is that the message could easily have been decocted into half the number of pages this book has. At times the explanations of the concepts seem so childishly elementary and basic, that it frustrates you to think that you've wasted your time reading the entire chapter, when it was all clearly explained in the first two paragraphs...This problem is by no means endemic to this book, however, as most self-help books suffer the same fate. Would it be too difficult to find something well written that also has a good message?Nonetheless, if you do choose to buy this book, don't believe you will be the recipient of some great literary work. Buy it because you would like to have more familiarity with the simple message that the other reviewers have summarised above. Simply that."
5,Enlightening,"This same book was loaned to my husband about a year ago. He was having an issue with another close family member and was almost consumed with guilt over the actions of that family member (actions which he has no control over). He doesn't read much but between the person who loaned the book and myself, we convinced him to read it. It took awhile for him to finish because he was really interested in it and wanted to understand each of the 4 agreements thouroughly. It isn't a particullarly hard read but after each chapter or two, you need to stop and reflect how it relates to your life and how you can incorporate the ideas into your future thinking.My husband had me order this book so he could have it as his own personal copy and also I ordered another copy for him to give to his sibling."
2,I hate to disagree with a Bestseller,"I have read many spiritual authors and after reading the reviews of this book I decided to give it a try.The book has a lovely cover and a lovely premise I just found that it did not ring true for me. I ordinarily do not leave reviews but I thought it might be helpful to give a counterpoint to the lavish praise of this book.I found this prescription for happiness not only simplistic but also a denial of the human condition. I don't even think I'd like living in the heaven that Ruiz describes. Some of his ideas are thought provoking, perhaps even disturbing if a person was to take them to heart.Not for everyone."
1,The book that wasn't there ...,"Ruiz's basic assumptions are faulty, and his descriptions of human behavior do not ring true. Silly book."
1,new age fluff and bs,"The author has simply re-written established theory and thought with his own inane terminology. He offers nothing new and because of his attempt to try to sound like he has new ideas by using fluff wording, he also misses the point and effectiveness of what books by earlier authors have provided. I resent that I spent money on this worthless drivel."
1,A lot of pages about nothing,"""Unsubstantiated jibberish"" is the way I'd sum up this book. I found the author's lack of content irritating throughout. It reads quickly though as you won't be slowed down with any thought-provoking content."
2,Profoundly basic,"At the risk of sounding trite and petty, I don't believe this book is worth reading. I had high expectations due to so many great review however I failed to see the profound value in reading it. Principles are basic and wordy. Metaphors and references are superficial and overly simplistic. Book was an easy read, and brought some concepts to mind but book was not worth buying."
1,does it get better?,"I can see how shelf space is so valuable to Authors and Publishers. I was feeling like a bit of a pick me up and although I have not finished the book I am hoping to still retrieve some valuable information from it. When a book is plastered all over the book store you believe it has something to say. So far I have learned that your parents play a significant role in your value system, the religion that you are initially exposed to, and your name! And it took several pages to reiterate that. I do not look forward to going back to it but perhaps I will walk away with a bit of insight by the time I close the book?"
2,Okay if you can wade through the existentialism,"There are many universal trues on the audio tape. This may be a better tool for someone who has had much difficulty in life than for someone simply looking to confirm or clarify life philosophy.If ""this life is only a dream"" is down your alley then this book is for you. Otherwise, it can be existentialist to the point of being nauseating."
3,Marginally interesting,This book looked interesting at first but found it to be an over-simplication of Jungian ideas. I was disappointed but read it anyway. Takes about an afternoon to read through. The author's style annoyed me but the general principles were right on.
4,Aid to living life true to self,"I read this book with a group dedicated to continuing spirituality in our lives as physicians, photographer, community organizer, parents of high schoolers. The four agreements provide guideposts for figuring out what you believe versus what we have been indoctrinated to believe."
1,The four agreements,I did not enjoy the book. It was a struggle to stay focused on the words. I thought there was too much intellectualization to hold my interest
5,Four Agreement,I was referred to this book and it was awesome. Just some basic things that we take for granted. It is an easy read and hard to put down. It speaks to everyday situations and give you the tools for make a better you. Great BOOK!!!!!!!!!
1,This is Fraud,"No one currently alive is Toltec because there haven't been any Toltec around for a very, very, very long time.The word Toltec in Mesoamerican studies has been used in different ways by different scholars to refer to actual populations and polities of precolumbian central Mexico or to the mythical ancestors mentioned in the mythical/historical narratives of the Aztecs. It is an ongoing debate whether the Toltecs can be understood to have formed an actual ethnic group at any point in Mesoamerican history or if they are mostly or only a product of Aztec myth.The Toltec,were incredibly warlike,if they existed.Which makes The Four Agreements bogus.1. Be impeccable with your word.2. Don't take anything personally.3.Never make assumptions.4.Always do your best.-Not the teachings of the warlike Toltecs,if indeed they ever existed.Write a self help book if you like,but leave out the bogus claims."
5,Life Changing Book,"This book was recommended to me by a friend. When I first started reading the book I was a bit turned off by some of the references to ""magic"" but I'm glad I got past that... Taken as a whole, this is a truly wonderful book, which changed my entire outlook on life."
1,Not a keeper for me.,"This book was suggested by a dear friend as good inspirational reading for our holiday book club gathering. I typically prefer a good historical fiction novel, but approached this material with an open mind and an open heart. I grew increasingly frustrated with Mr. Ruiz's blanket statements of ""do this and it will make you happy"" with nothing credible to support such a bold directive. By the end of the book, Mr. Ruiz has provided for the unsuspected and misguided a entire quiver full of excuses of how to get through life without ever challenging yourself or accepting responsibility for your deficiencies. If you like this book, other suggested reading material would be ""I'm Good Enough, I'm Smart Enough, and Doggone It, People Like Me!: Daily Affirmations With Stuart Smalley""."
5,Inspirational,I recommend this for anyone needing guidance and gain wisdom. I bought 8 books for christmas to give away. I have the audio book and have listened to it several times. It really makes you think and lifts you up.
4,The Four Agreements,I thought this book was excellent. It is a good book for anyone who wants to get their thoughts in order. It is a good reminder to not let others words hurt us. It is good for self esteem and confidence. I highly recommend it to anyone who feels they need a boost in these areas and for others to know if they are on the right track with their thinking and life.
4,short and sweet,Start reading the book the moment you get it...you won't be sorry. It just gives you yet another way to be yourself the 'best way' possible without giving up your space and emotional well being. Clear messages that should be taken to heart and clear messages that should be read over and over again until they sink in....I recommend this book for yourself and for people who like to 'grow'.
1,PLEASE... Read the 1 star reviews BEFORE you buy this book!,"I am shocked at all the 5 stars and positive press this book has received. PLEASE, read a few of the 1 star reviews before you purchase this book. Quite often people who rate something with just 1 star are grumpy individuals who just want to argue... not this time. Many writers of the single star reviews are extremely well spoken, very well read and positive minded individuals. They are worth reading! (More so than this book.)"
5,Words of Wisdom,"This is my second copy of this book. I keep one at home, and one in my office to loan to clients."
4,short & sweet,"Great, simple . I bought it at the same time as Live Like A Fruit Fly which I also recommend to anyone who likes these types of books."
5,An life changing book,"I read this book while I was on vacation. Immediately, it impacted my life positively on every facet of my life. I feel great and I feel free. I always take things personal, but thanks to this book, its helping me. Please read this book and share it with everyone."
3,Nothing new,"This book was less than I expected. There is good practical advice - like cultivating distance from your own thoughts and other people's words and replacing old ideas with new beliefs. However, there's really nothing new here, it's more of a common-sense book, and I see little, if anything, that hasn't been taught many times over by other popular authors and most major religions. I prefer the book of wisdom by Taro Gold called ""Open Your Mind, Open Your Life."""
5,Life affirming/Life altering,This book is a concise roadmap to getting healthy and living in the present. Having read a small mountain of self-help books in the past this is the ONE book I would point to as an absolute guide to a simple effective way to turn things around.
5,It is amazingly simple and unbelievably powerfull,I think that this world become more happier onc everyone read this book.
2,Agreements have merit,"Basic content had value, but being self-assured and not insecure, would have one already practicing what was 'preached.' Lacked depth"
4,Interesting Book,The writing style is a bit simplistic but it gets the main messages across. This book was recommend by a friend and it is an easy read.
3,Okaay,"Started reading this publication and came to my senses. Jehovah God in his word, The Bible, has given wisdom necessary for over two thousand years. All I had/have to do is consult it, then DO.Gave book to the Salvation Army."
1,There is reason to believe this book tells lies,"While this book offers some thouhtful suggestions, close reading reveals much of the philosophy presented here to be in direct opposition to the truths expressed by the Bible. This book encourages you to create your own reality, to make no distinction between right and wrong and in effect, fire your conscience. It states that ""evil is nothing but a disease of the human mind"". It claims that our point of view is the only one that matters. It states ""we realize that the point of view that other people use to see the world has nothing to do with us"".It refers to some basic beliefs of Christianity as ""mythology"". I could go on but I think Christians should keep their Bibles nearby if they read this book so they can prove to themselves this new age philosophy is not compatible with Christ's teachings.I recommend referencing Hebrews 4:12,13"
1,Terrible New Age Spirituality...Catholics Beware,"There is not an honest word in this book. Formal Religion, Ritual and Tradition are tossed aside carelessly. Makes a joke out of traditional theology by saying that Religion and Everything we have learned is part of a dream and those that taught it to us were brainwashed and that we as a result are brainwashed...Utterly ridiculous, this guy is a hack and should not have grossed dollar one, let alone made Oprah's book list (boy has my opinion of that list dropped). If we all do as he suggests, be free and do whatever we want then the world will be in a state of anarchy. Also I have never laughed so hard at any book in my life. I had to read this book so I could debate against it for work, otherwise you should not bother picking this up. Catholics look at ""Rediscovering Catholicism"" by Matthew Kelly, and any other Christians take a look at ""He Chose the Nails"" by Max Lucado."
1,Disagree,"Mr Ruiz says---""Take the example of Hitler: He sent out all those seeds of fear, and they grew very strong and beautifully achieved massive destruction. Seeing the awesome power of the word, we must understand what power comes out of our mouths. One fear or doubt planted in our mind can create an endless drama of events. One word is like a spell, and humans use the word like black magicians, thoughtlessly putting spells on each other.""..beautifully achieved massive destruction...???This is in Mr. Ruiz's book!!This is the only self-help book I've ever read that hassaid that Hitler's destruction was ""beautifully achieved"" !!You said only what you mean (according to your belief system).I will now say only what I mean: Do not trust a self help book that says:""Take the example of Hitler: He sent out all those seeds of fear, and they grew very strong and beautifully achieved massive destruction.""I see no beauty in what Hitler did. Only the massive destruction of many millions of people."
5,Must Read,You need to read this book; it will take very little of your time.It explains why you beat yourself up and can help you to stop. It can help you to like yourself.This book can help you find peace of mind.
5,Like a Breathe of Fresh Air,This book is exactly what I wanted from philosophy which is 'How do I make my life more enjoyable?' Don Miguel Ruiz makes it clear and gives us an easy path to follow. He reassures important concepts so not to keep going backwords throughout the book.
5,The Four Agreements,"a must for anyone who want to get back to or get down with the basics of life...I bought this for myself, friends and my daughter...We consider it a life tutorial."
4,the wisdom giver,"A book of wisdom that serves as chicken soup for not only the soul but the brain as well. I, Tim Kahoe have just finished reading the wisdom book,""The Four Agreements"" by Don Miguil Ruiz. This great book tells how life really is. Mr. Ruiz explains of why things hapen and how to deal with ""it all."" I recomend this book because it can make you a more calm better person. Mr. Ruiz tells the four agreements throughout his book beautifuly and this is sure to be one of the books i put on my wish list next christmas."
4,Nothing New Under The Sun,"It appears that some who read this were looking for a new spiritual path. No, the concepts are not really new, they are continued in many religions in some form, most especially Buddhism. That being said, these are valuable concepts put in a lyrical form that I found to be very enjoyable. I also found some phrases that really hit home to me such as ""The human is the only animal on earth that pays a thousand times for the same mistake. The rest of the animals pay once...but not us. We judge ourselves, find ourselves guilty, and we punish ourselves... every time we remember, we judge ourselves again, and punish ourselves again, and again, and again...is that fair?""Enjoy what you can of this book and just leave the rest alone."
5,The real way we should look at things...,The amazing view of this book and the way the author puts things into perspective are very amazing. I recomend this book to whomever wants to disconnect from the way we are used to looking at our lives.
5,Thought provoking,"After reading this book, I realized that everyday I began thinking about The Four Agreements. While the concepts are simple, applying them are difficult. In some ways, this little book has changed my life by altering my thought process. In my job, Emergency Dispatch, it has helped me get thru the day."
2,"LOVE the agreements, but the book is WEAK","The Four Agreements really are life changing, but the book does NOT add any more insight; it just says the same thing over and over. I read the agreements and loved them. They are so simple, but so powerful to hear and it has already made me a stronger person. I bought the book thinking that I would get more insight into the agreements...... but the book just repeated them! It uses really obvious examples and it keeps referring to the metaphor ""hell"" (the place people are in when they judge others and don't understand each other) and other metaphors... but they don't enhance the reading. The author just repeats the same thing that was said by replacing words with symbols. I definitely say that the agreements are AWESOME... but seriously... the book is not. Just learn the agreements and you'll be set! (If you do buy the book, think of it as a donation or thank you to the author for simply revealing the 4 agreements)"
2,All these kind of books are alike,"All this kind of books are equal, the writer writes what happened to him and think that if everybody do what he is doing will be a better world. The book is definitely boring and it has nothing of the Toltec story, if you skip the introduction and you go directly to the four agreements and only read that, will be fine. Don't waste your time with the epilogue either."
1,There are no Toltecs! So how can this guy be one?,"What we know about about the Toltecs comes from the writings of the King of Texcoco, Nezahualcoyotl, whose work was miraculously saved from the Spanish fires due to the influence his descendents had with the Spanish, having collaborated with them in the defeat of that Aztecs. Nezahualcoyotl said that the Toltecs had dissapeared already, and their disappearance was some 200 years before the arrival of the Spanish, so that means this took place about 700 years ago. So, in order to accept the basic premise of this guy that he is a ""Toltec shaman"", we have to throw the facts right out the window. Where, in Mexico, I would like to know, do these ""Toltecs"" live? Do they have a reservation, maybe? How about a language that they speak? Is this like ""Lost World"" or Shangri-La, maybe? SO remote that explorers haven't even found it yet? Hello?!"
4,Good 4 Agreements,"The most significant part of this book is on the flap; the 4 agreements printed on the flap. One can really make so much difference should he/she live his/her lifes upholding these agreements.However, the contents of the book didn't appeal to me as much."
2,Nothing to it,"This book was very disappointing. I think the 4 agreements are great guidelines to live by. However, the book itself does a poor job of expanding on the ideas. The content of the book would fit nicely into a magazine article. Also, I found the writing to be somewhat poor. The thing I liked most about the book was the cover!"
5,Gina Rubel's Review of The Four Agreements,"Don Miguel's The Four Agreements is a life-altering book. Every person I know in business should read this book and adopt the philosophies at home and in work. I have recommended this book to lawyers, advertising and marketing agency executives, accountants, public relations practitioners, publicists, women in business and so many others. It's a refreshing view of how we can live our lives more fully, achieve personal and professional success, and love ourselves and others in a perpetual state of awareness and growing wisdom."
1,Drivel-- reads like it was written by a televangelist.,"I read this book at the request of a friend for a reading group, not for my own particular interest.Ruiz occasionally made an interesting point, but his content was far from earth-shattering. The largest put-off to me was his repetitive and preachy style of writing. I felt my intelligence as a reader insulted by his constant almost-nagging. Perhaps this is the style in which most self-help and new age drivel is written, but I feel the book could have been far more poignant at about a quarter the length."
5,life altering book,"This book was given to me by a friend as I exited an abusive marriage. I have since read it several times, and bought multiple copies to give to friends as they need it. These four simple agreements can (and have in my case) completely transform a life. Highly recommended . . . (would even add a super extra sixth star if the option was there."
5,Practical as well as deep,"The first time I read it, I blew through the book. Fairly practical information and good clear examples. Wasn't a lot of new material to me, but it was presented well and in a new light--so to speak.The second time, however, is a real work. It has been cause for me to reflect and reorganize some of the ways I think about things. You can take the simple statements of this book and go as deep as you want with it. For me, this time around is having a profound affect on how I view things. I am particularly engaged in the whole agreement and domestication aspects he presents."
5,A Practical Guide to Personal Freedom,"The information and reminders in this book are effective. They are simple concepts that work when applied. The way the book is written, everything makes perfect sense, and when I remember to follow the four agreements, I feel an immediate shift inside, to a freer feeling.This is a great book for the reminders, and to help with personal liberation from unnecessary suffering."
1,Extraordinarily Shallow,"Even based on contemporary standards, this common sense based pamphlet is undeserving of ""Book"" classification. The wisdom contained herein could have been communicated in two paragraphs. Read it at the library or your local bookstore. You can do so in 25 minutes. There is nothing in here that is new or revealing - if you were raised to be courteous, you already know the ""secrets"" anyway. A rip-off of monumental proportions. Reminds me of when the Beatles traveled far to meet with the Maharishi. Like wow dude, look at how cool we are, we are spiritual and on, like a different plane man."
2,Some what disappointed,"The book starts off with interesting anticipation but never fully developes the self improving or self intraspectional momentum I had been told that it would. Perhaps someone in the early stages of spiritual development may identify with the repeatative brow beating, but I for one found it annoying. There are glimpses and flashes of note worthy insights but they are barried in the mirkiness of metaphor and superstition. Two stars."
2,Nothing really special here,"The Four Agreements is a brief little book of commonsensical wisdom, but with barely enough material to really call it a book. It is more like an extended essay. For some the perceptions about the four agreements might be revelatory, but for this reader I found it humdrum, and not much different than the wisdom I garnered while listening to my GrandFather's stories. There is nothing esoteric here, just common sense."
5,Suggestions to Live by,"This book is a quick read which stresses some very key elements to live by. It boosted my self awareness to new levels. Learn to speak with integrity, not take things personally, smash assumptions and my favorite... be the best you, you can be. Remember as with anything in life. You get out of it what you put into it! Happy reading!"
2,Sorry Not realistic,I am human and imperfect. I am not at my best when I am tired or frustrated or dissapointed or overwhelmed. Sometimes I even make bad choices on purpose! But in my next life and in a perfect world I will ALWAYS :) Be impecable with my word. Don't take anything personally. Don't make assumptions. Always do my best. Nice thoughts but NOT realistic.
4,Plenty Of Food For Thought For A Truly Better Life !!,"This fast-reading volume offers a lot more than I expected. It is a profound statement based on the ancient Toltec Mexican-related religious wisdom that is as valuable today as it was in ancient times. The teachings are quite simple, and they encourage you to live purposely and help you grow. There's much to ponder to help you achieve this growth. In the modern life, everything is so complex. It's refreshing to read about the simple things you can do in your daily life, to help you really live a good, personally satisfaction-filled life. It gets you to realize THAT YOUR LIFE IS GOOD, and you can take comfort in that, and grow personally. Very worthwhile reading. Read it and share it with those you love."
2,It's good common sense,"This is a good book. I decided to pop a 2 star down just to balance out all of the exaggerration votes thrown up for this teeny tiny book. Take a look at the dimensions of this book. All it says is to always tell the truth, always try as hard as you can, to never take anything personal, and don't make assumptions. This book is the type that you read and it inspires you to behave a little differently for a day or two, but is entirely forgettable beyond that point. I think that for the same amount of money you can get a book that is 4 times bigger and actually has something to digest. This book didn't change me at all. A good book is one that you can't help but remember; I kind of wish I could forget buying this little money maker."
4,The Four Agreements,"I liked the book, but only because I have the flash cards...the flash cards are more to the point and are direct...the book is vague and leaves it to your interpretation...either way I recommend...."
2,Eh,"This book came highly recommended but honestly I didn't think it went very deep at all. Basically everything you need to know is listed on the back cover. Each ""agreement"" is rather obvious so they don't require such lengthy descriptions. Sure it's a good reminder of certain stuff but this book did not change my life/mindset."
2,Poor,"Possibly I misread the info on the book, but it clearly it fell well bellow my expectations. Don't bother buying it."
1,Stopped reading the book after first few pages,I don't like books like the Secret and this feels as one of those books with inhuman and unrealistic advice.
5,Amazing Book,I give this book a five because it really helped me through a rough time in my life and helped bring me a totally different perspective. The shipping was fast and the book truly captures you.
5,If only....,I loved this book and can only strive to live by the basic pricipals contained within. Remembering is the key.
3,A little too New Age-y for my tastes,"I agree with the basic premise of the ""Four Agreements"": Be Impeccable with Your Word, Don't Take Anything Personally, Don't Make Assumptions and Always Do Your Best. The way it's presented feels a little too ""New Age"" to me - I didn't make it through the whole book."
5,I live by the agreements,Your world will be a better place if you live by the four agreements you make with yourself. Four is so much easier than say 10 25 or 100 ways to ....
2,Too repetative,Concept is good. I've read alot of other books about the same concept. But the author in this book kept repeating over and over and over the same thing which drove me nuts. I couldnt finish the book.
2,"Eh, good premise, but leaves much to be desired","The actual four principles of the book are solid, good principles. But they are entertwined with a lot of new-agey fluff that was not worth my time (not that it's a long book). If you pick up on the four principles from the reviews, you've gotten it."
4,Learn new Lessons well.......,"I'm learning a couple new lessons with this book, lessons I never thought of till now.......I'm keping this book as a 'manuel' to check back into!"
5,It is the essential,"I read that book a few months ago, following a friend's suggestion, and was quite impressed by its profound teachings. The other day I was talking to a friend, telling her about the teachings I remembered from that book, which were appropriate to give some insights on what we were talking about. She told me later that at that moment, she really felt ""back to the essential."" Because beyond all the fog, beyond everything that we are trying to do, the person we are pretending to be, we know there is something deeper. This book touches that. I read it again today. Even though it is short, I could read it every month of my life I think and find something new. Many of the readers said they bought multiple copies to share with friends."
2,help yourself and sell it after you've read it,"I must start off by saying that I am not a self-help person. I read it and remained unconvinced. The stuff in this book is the same that floats across the air every day. Framed in ""ancient"" teachings, it might appear wise, but wisdom does not have to be a function of age or another (foreign, exotic) culture. I'm not trying to be mean, but this felt equally artificial as Anthony Robbins' plastic face."
1,I like books for REAL people,"I read this book because it was recommended to me by a therapist that I respect and admire. I still admire the therapist, but this book was not for me at all. I tried hard to understand and get some pearls of wisdom out of it, but it was work. I could have spent my time in more useful ways. Sure, the ideas are great . . . it's just that most human beings can't be that perfect. In my opinion, to try to be would be completely unrealistic."
1,Nice principles my 5 yr old already knows,"I dont know how enlightening this ""toltec"" wisdom is supposed to be. But this 168pg book doesnt seem to be doing it justice. It doesnt give enough reliable background on the Toltecs and just how much time the author studied it before becoming a ""shaman"". I did a little research on Mr.Ruiz and found out he does tours on Teotihuacan where the Toltec are said to have existed and it could be that he did this book inorder to attract more tourism or something. Or maybe not. But either way, this book just didnt convince me at all. I also read the Toltecs were around for about 2 or 3 centuries and to believe these four principles is what got them through alot, I just dont think so."
5,a lovely little book,"A friend recommended this book to me and I'm grateful that he did. This is a short, but very profound little book and came to me at just the right time in my journey. If you are not ready to accept and assimilate the information provided, it will be hard to appreciate this book fully. I know that I wouldn't have been ready until now. I have the four agreements posted on my fridge and am trying to think about them often as I go about my daily life. They are so simple to comprehend, yet it is amazing what a challenge it really can be to practice them fully."
2,Right ... and I'm a Vestal Virgin!,"I must be getting cynical in my old age, but I just can't accept this as anything more than four bits of common sense advice (like ""Always Do Your Best"") couched in a lot of New Age gobblygook. Don't get me wrong -- I **AM** a ""new thought"" believer and have a large collection of New Age spirituality and self help books, but this one is all hype and no substance.And sorry, but if the author is the chosen transmitter of ancient Toltec wisom, then I'm a Vestal Virgin. Be sure to buy my book on ancient Eqyptian wisdom (Rule one: Never kill a hippo on the Nile). Just $14.00, as seen on Ophra."
2,I do not like green eggs and ham....,"It has been about 6 years since I read this, but I have had a few recently recommend this as though it is a masterpiece. My response was "" I agree with the four agreements but I don't like the book at all."" I get some strange looks and responses but its more like common sense to me. I totally agree that you can just read the cover and get the message just fine. Intentionally went to the one and two star reviews because for me it seemed so basic Reminders are good because life can make things feel more complicated but I do not consider the wisdom ancient at all."
5,A Book That Will Change Your Life,"There are only a few books that I would place in this category, but this became one of them. The information in this book can change your life for the better. A ""must read!"" for you and everyone you love."
5,Four Agreements,"This book was recommended by my therapist and exactly what I needed. It speaks to the situation that brought me to it plus others from my past. I wish I would have read this years ago, but then again, I may not have been ready for it. It's an easy read but definitely stretches the mind at the same time."
1,"a month and havent received product, dont use this seller",I ordered the four agreements on dec 15 of 2010 it is not going on an entire month and I have not received the book or gotten an email back from this seller when I asked where my product is! Do not use!!!!!
3,The Four Agreements : A Practical Guide to Personal Freedom,The four agreements are indeed important and simple. I found the delivery to be tedious. I would not recommend this book.
3,"""Willy Nilly"" freedom approach","""The Four Agreements"" are 1) Be Impeccable with Your Words, 2) Don't Take Anything Personally, 3) Don't Make Assumptions and 4) Always Do Your Best. While I would subscribe to these agreements, I do not follow some of the author's ""willy nilly"" freedom approach."
1,"Save your money, buy Harry Potter instead","A poorly written self-help book filled with logical fallacies and ridiculous assumptions. Ruiz spends 138 pages drawing out a message which could be presented neatly on a post-it note. Unless your life has completely fallen apart and you need to instill an entirely new moral compass, this book won't help you.To anyone who has called this book ""eye-opening"", why were you walking around with your eyes closed in the first place? You won't learn anything from this book that you couldn't have figured out on your own.The biggest problem with these new-age self-help books, however, is that the pages are coated in some sort of flame-resistant material. It's very frustrating to not be able to use this book as a fire-starter."
5,A Timeless Book,I enjoyed re-reading this timeless book that helps me direct my life's work.The stories are also rich with detail and helped me implement the four agreements easily.
3,Good,"The ideas are wonderful, however without the depth that I was expecting in conveying them. Tolle's books have the type of depth and abstraction I am referring to."
4,insightful,"I read the book while traveling abroad and it helped me look at people with a more positive attitude. The book makes you think about how you view yourself and others, along with very good ideas for how to improve your own self imaging. On a regular basis I find myself relating daily occurances to the book and trying to use the information in order to be supportive and helpful to people who may be struggling in their day. The book encourages the reader to have a positive attitude for yourself, only you can treat yourself poorly, either by your mindset, or by allowing others to take advantage of you. It does make you think, and encourages daily growth without guilt. If you have disruptive thoughts, analyze why, and try to correct it so the next opportunity is positive. I enjoyed the different delivery from other books that strictly say ""have a positive attitude"", but don't give any techniques for helping yourself and others."
5,four agreement!,It is an amassing book the four agreement should be for all ages and I believe should be taught in school.
4,Wisdom for a Better life,"This book contains a great deal of wisdom and practical advice to live a better life freely and spiritually. Its written simply but the message is profound. Somewhat repetitive , however I think thats helpful for our forgetful minds. Definitely a recommended read."
5,Magnificent Book a must read for spiritual growth,This great book provides the roadmap of daily commitments with ourselves that we should live by; following the rules set out in the book and our relationships will greatly improve.
5,"My favorite ""Cognitive Therapy"" book","When I first read this deceptively simple book I thought what a shame it was that I was never given this as a ""Users Guide"" to a good life when I was in my teens. I was in my 40's when I first read it and had figured many of the rules out with much needless pain and effort. The way they fit together helps me make profound shift in my relationship with myself and others. This is the book I use most often in my Psychiatry practice to help people think through their interpersonal problems and find healthy solutions to their lives. Almost any conflict can be viewed by looking at the agreements and seeing which one you need to remember to keep."
4,"No high literary value, but great ideas","I did not like the language and style of the book from the literary point of view, but I thought the ideas described were very powerful."
4,Quick but valuable statement,"This book, if taken to heart and put into practice, can ABSOLUTELY change your life. It has changed mine, and so much so that I continue to buy additional copies and give them away to others. Buy this book, and then live it. You'll be glad you did."
4,Stated in a Different Way,Change Your Thoughts - Change Your Life: Living the Wisdom of the TaoThis book written about four agreements basically talks about honoring yourself. It brings up that assumptions really have no purpose and often have people deal with incorrect information. And the author gives a simple solution of asking questions. It is written in a way to cause thought in a person about having joys and getting things out of the way that stop this. Good read.
1,Bad News,"This book is bad news. Not only has the author written this book on a 3rd. grade reading level, the book just goes on and on and on about essentially the same thing. And his references to the Bible...I wonder if he has actually read the Bible because his interpretation is way off base. This book is ridiculous . Don't waste you time and money."
1,Bookreader,"I thought this book was quite weak. A few good points, but not a great learning experience."
2,So whats all the Hype about?,"Ok i bought this book expecting something extraordnary, and i was vastly dissapointed. Expectations aside, this book was just an oversimplified 'instruction' to enlightenment. MR Ruiz seems to think he is the only wise and enlightened being on the planet. Save your time. read the dalai lama! ~Namaste~"
1,A complete waste of time (at least it was a short book).,"This book manages to be both incredibly bland and infuriatingly trite. If the editors had removed all the repetitious drivel it would have been four pages long. It certainly does NOT ""read in a voice you would expect from an indigenous shaman"" unless you're easily persuaded by sophmoric attempts at parody. Either this is satire or the New Age industry has sunk to an all-time low."
5,A Good and Practical Book,"May be the essence of what you will read in this book could sound familiar to you depending if you had previously read books on oriental philosophy or written by Carlos Castañeda, but what is valuable about the ""Four Agreements"" and the other books by Don Miguel Ruiz, is the simple way he uses to describe a new guide that people can put into practice to make easy the way of life in these complicated modern times. If you use the four agreement, your inner life could improve, despite the author recognizes that to apply the agreements all the time in your daily life could be difficult, what it is important is to have in mind all the principles. The author uses practical examples to describe the agreements that has a lot of sense. I totally recommend this book and the others written by this author."
1,Four Agreements Review,"This was a big disappointment. It was recommended to me by a ""personal coach"" along with a few other books. The others were great and I enjoyed the different perspectives they brought.This book, however, contained too much ""new age mumbo-jumbo"" for me. I tried my hardest to get past that and finish the book.Unfortunately, I hit the wall about halfway through."
2,A disappointment,"I purchased this book with great hope. Normally I enjoy this type of book thoroughly. However, while the Four Agreements themselves are excellent ideas, the rest of the book did not measure up. I could have done just as well with a book that listed the Four Agreements and then gave a one-paragraph description of what each meant. Everything else in the book is repetitive fluff. I was greatly disappointed."
2,"Not unless you're already ""into"" this kind of stuff.","Personally, after listening to almost half, I have come to the conclusion that this stuff is a bunch of......poo. It rambles endlessly and whatever the author is trying to say is needlessly basted in an unending metaphor. It's just idiotic nonsense and unless you're already died in the wool mystic new-age please don't waste your money. Or send me a couple of dollars and a pre-posted envelope and you can have mine. Hurry before I throw it in the garbage."
2,Is this tape that great? The Four Agreements:how to be free,"The four aggreements: A Practical Guide to Personal Freedom: I am only 14 years old, and personally, it is commen sense to me about what this tapes message is trying to get accross to you. I give it two stars because, well it teaches you not to judge and basically how to accept and live how you want to live with out interferrence from the world, and I allready new that. Now if you would like a book that is EXCELLENT!! I personally think, you should read I AM ME I AM FREE by David Icke you can order this book from amazon go check it out that is a great guide I think to freedom, but personally I kind of like to figure things out on my own but soemtime we need other peoples thoughts for ideas. Well go check it out I am me i am free by david icke. any questions email me at antirecords57@hotmail.com"
4,Great Condition but long wait,"The Book was received in better condition than expected, however, it took longer to arrive than expected as well."
5,Sigh of relief,"Like coming home and kicking off a pair of high heels and feeling a warm,soft carpet between yor blissfully spreading toes,thats what this book is like.That sigh, that moment when you experience the relief of freedom. The Four Agreeements helps you see things in a different way--a way that makes perfect sense,--like when you work a puzzle piece this way & that, and then,---it fits! This book gives practical advice that will take you out of the hell that we so often send ourselfs into."
3,Not As Good As I Expected,"I was really expecting alot from this book since I had heard so much about it. I listened to the Book-on-tape. To me, the Four Agreements seem very basic. This is probably a good book for a person just starting out on a spiritual path and who needs to start from the beginning.The ideas based on the ancient Toltec wisdom were given in a very clear and easy to understand manner. But there are places in the book where the author talks about Christian theology and ideas and he misquotes the bible. If he is going to compare his theology to a different religion, that he should have studied up and known what he was talking about.The book does give some clear ideas on how to transform your life. The book-on-tape was read by Peter Coyote and was very easy to understand."
1,NONSENSE ! ! !,"What a load of nonsensical mumbo-jumbo feel-goodism! If you look at some of the things he actually says, you wonder how the book could be so popular. True, once in a while, he wanders in from the wilderness to make a useful statement or even offer sound advice. But his thought processes are nonsensical.An example from p.54: ""Sometimes you hear a voice in your mind, and you may wonder where it came from. This voice may have come from ANOTHER REALITY in which there are LIVING BEINGS very similar to the human mind."" (my emphasis)And on p.26 he quotes from the Bible, John 1:1, and then misinterprets the meaning of ""Word"" from that context, and goes on from there to... wherever, it matters not.There may be some nuggets, but I couldn't stand trying to pluck them out of the morass of his Toltec-speak nonsense."
1,Useless.,I only read the first chapter...The basis of this book is about the author receiving some sacred information from his ancestors. He is revealing that sacred information to rest of the world now.I find that kind of thinking useless when it comes to personal improvement...
5,Experiential learning,Everyone should read this book. It is a book that can bring you to an amazing understanding of self and one's space in the journey of life. Don't pass this one up. D. Nicolle Admire BS.
2,Nothing but a whole bunch of fluff.,"Sometimes the most obvious answers are overlooked, which is why I enjoyed the inside flap of this book.I could have done without the rest of it, however.I completely agree with another reviewer that the author's writing style is way too repetitive. I guess that's to be expected when you're faced with the task of turning four sentences into a full-blown book.As you can imagine, really painful to read through.It kind of reminded me of when I was in elementary school and I had to write three full paragraphs about why orange was my favorite color.The most important parts of the book are already revealed in the description Amazon has provided, so I suggest you save yourself the money as you already know what's going on.I am returning the book the same day I bought and read it."
5,Worth Reading,"I'm a very happy person who has already been living my life according to my values for several years now. My family is supportive, my friends are wonderful, and I am able to appreciate the tremendous creativity of those all around me.Still, these 4 agreements are invaluable to me. As good as anyone has it, as happy as you are, there's always more to work on. Ruiz lays out how important communication and influence are, and concisely states the need for living more purposefully. The agreements are definitely common sense, but I defy any of the readers to say that they couldn't use to be reminded of these gems of wisdom constantly.I'm glad I read it, and am recommending it to friends. Some of his personal beliefs may offend fundamentalists, but being a fundamentalist implies having a shallow understanding of the teachings of the great masters anyways."
1,Boring.,"I'm somewhat surprised that two people recommended this book to me. How others have not considered these very basic moral principles is beyond me. Long ago, I realized I must seek my full potential, be truthful to my word, give the benefit of the doubt to others, and seek the truth in others' statements. These are pretty much the 4 agreements in short.He's basically just saying don't get herded along like a sheep by the facade of lies present everywhere you look in our world. I'm glad more people will be able to adopt a skeptic's perspective after reading this book. Welcome to the club, you're a little late, but that's okay.The statement that we all live by our parents principles, doesn't apply to all. I thought most people made it a point to seek their own opinions about life, but apparently not.In truth, I didn't even finish it because it is rather poorly written. It lacked the creative dynamic to pull me in... just a little bland."
5,Simple and brilliant,"The four agreements are simple, and, yes, obvious. What's not so obvious is what they *do*. They keep you from receding back into the Dream, back into dealing with the *story* you have in your head about the world and the other people who are in it. These are tools to keep you awake, to remind you that other people have stories in their heads about *you*, too, and most likely their actions are a result of reacting to that story and not to the actual you. The four agreements help to disentangle the drama and hurt of day-to-day life, to stalk out the lies that we tell ourselves about what is happening to us and around us. Read some of the one- and two-star reviews to see perfect examples of what Ruiz calls people who are caught in their dreams and unable to engage the observer, unable to relate to the world as it is."
1,Great book for insomnia!,"I was very disappointed after reading this book. I guess I was expecting something different or unique. The Four Agreements are nothing new, especially if you've read any other self-help book.The writing style is simplistic and very, very repetitive. I give it one star, because the book helped me fall asleep each night...which is something I've been having trouble with lately.Yawn!"
1,DON'T MAKE SENSE TO ME,"Maybe I missed something but why botherwith agreement one if two is in place. If aperson says ""I love you."" dont take it personal?If everyone discounts what the other says whydo we have teachers, leaders, andfriends. Why dont we all just quit talking andlive in our own little world --Heaven on Earth."
1,Did not enjoy this read,"Personally, I didn't enjoy this book. I didn't like the writing style of the author. He repeated himself A LOT - over and over the same message only written slighly differently. The inside flap has a blurb about the 4 agreements (and they ""do"" make sense and are things we should incorporate into our lives). However, after reading the flap, I knew all I needed to know about the 4 agreements and didn't need to read the book. It was a waste of time for me."
3,Decent,"If you can get through the ""there is no God - we are all God, there is no Hell - we live in Hell on earth, and there is no Heaven - we CAN have heaven on earth by following the 4 agreements"" mumbo-jumbo, the actual 4 agreements are good rules to live by.I only start the review that way because for completely unprovable positions mentioned above, the author certainly takes an authoritative stance.It is a very quick read with some good techniques that could be applied to improve anyone's life. I read in in about an hour without putting it down. I would have given it more stars, but the author chose to base everything around is ""we are all Gods"" theory, and even through in some corny prayers at the end.The bottom line is this: at the end of our lives, there will be a truth. Until then, the author would be best served sticking to the four agreements - they are pretty applicable."
1,Ancient Meso-American Psychobabble?,"If the ancient Toltecs ever heard of any of this stuff, I'll eat South America. ""The Toltecs were dream masters."" Yeah, right. How on earth could the author know such a thing? These poor wretches, desperately struggling to evade jaguars and alligators, did not have the leisure even to develop individual personalities, much less to juggle obviously anachronistic cliches such as Ruiz attributes to them. Clearly he is claiming their hoary antiquity and politically correct pre-Columbian exotic character to give a false seeming of ancient wisdom to his own half-platitudinous, half-arbitrary declamations. It is in effect another version of James Redfield's ludicrous Mayan ""Manuscript"" in his vapid The Celestine Prophecy. Too bad Peter Coyote's wonderful voice adds undeserved gravitas to the mess."
4,The Four Agreements are an Agreement for Your Life,"In The Four Agreements, Don Miguel Ruiz outlines and explains four agreements or strategies for living a more centered, peaceful life. The agreements seem simple and practical leaving the reader wondering why they never thought of them before or nodding in agreement. There are moments though when they seem a bit unrealistic for real life. Ruiz provides examples that simplify the agreemetns and make them plausible. There is a bit of the ""that sounds nice, but..."" feeling that accompanies reading parts of The Four Agreements. Ruiz explains a different way of looking at each individual's life and dealing with each other than most people will recognize. At its core, The Four Agreements is about treating one's self and those around one better. Ruiz has created a well-written, intriguing, easy to understand examination of the facets of Toltec Wisdom that the reader will want to keep on hand for reference when life feels chaotic or just painful."
5,Great philosophy!!,"This book offers great, positive guidelines to live by. It's also an easy read. I'd recommend it to anyone!!"
1,Just a pretty cover,The cover is the best part of this book as it is lovely. The content is amateurish at best. If you want to know what the four agreements are -- you can read the front inside panel of the book -- and forget the rest!
1,Infuriating rubbish - and I have myself to blame,"The book is well criticized in many of the 1-star reviews so I won't repeat the valid points made there but just add to the numbers.I am shocked that I actually bought this book - but there it is in my order history, bought from Amazon in late 2004. My age at the time (28 :-) ) does not justify this choice and I can only hope that it was a ""people who bought this also bought"" inspiration after putting Csikszentmihalyi's ""Flow"" into my cart.On the upside, I don't have any friends or relatives to think less of for giving it to me as a gift. And this teaches me to never ever trust the average ratings on Amazon again but always to check for very low ratings."
1,poor,This book could best be described as an insult to people's intelligence. Or perhaps the writing is just very very poor. The author has just written an entire book on four common-sense principles and managed it by writing as if we are young children and repeating everything several times to fill pages.
2,Very simple,"This book has some good advice. However, I found the narrative style to be aggravating. The style is didactic and somewhat childish. I finished the book only because a friend encouraged me to try to put the writing style aside. I think it was a good message, just bad packaging."
5,Much Needed Messages,"The messages in this book are much needed among humanity. Out of curiosity, I had to see a bit about the reviewer below that calls this book ""nonsense"". The man is 53 years old, so please bear in mind that while some people may have a half century of wisdom, there are millions of young adults that could really use the inight this book provides.It helped me a lot, especially about not taking things personally and making assumptions. This is a really great book, you will be glad you read it!"
5,The essential guide to Spiritual awakening.,By applying Don Miguel Ruiz's concepts from this book you can change your life for ever and find an exciting new world as your playground.
4,Different way to see life,"Good book, a different and good way to see life, try to live the four agreements every day. Be happy."
1,Very disappointing,"The 4 agreements are interesting in themselves, and I looked them up on Google a while back to get a basic explanation of them. The book was far less useful than the Google search. I was hoping that it might explain why these 4 agreements were chosen over other possibilities - why these 4 are so fundamental. It does nothing of the sort."
5,And they said life doesn't come with a guide book!,"Putting gods and devils aside this is a life-changing book if you read it carefully. It will explain why we don't keep the agreements. If you can keep these four simple agreements, you're life will work in a way you that frees you from anxiety."
1,A Work of Platitudes for Children,"The other one star reviews extensively cover the platitudinous nature of this book. From a literary standpoint this book is written on a third grade level at best. The entire book consists of repetitive, shallow messages written so poorly that such writing would not earn a passing grade as an elementary school writing assignment. If you seek wisdom, enlightenment, or entertainment look elsewhere."
2,Self-contradictory,"Although I understand what the author is trying to convey here, he contradicts himself. He states that we shouldn't take anything that anyone does or says personally, but he later explains how we sometimes attract those people that treat us the way we want to be treated, i.e. someone who sees themselves as a victim will often attract abusive people. While this is true, how then can we not take what people say and do seriously if we caused the situation in the first place? This is a well-intentioned but ultimately confusing book; I've read better books of its kind."
2,IT WAS OKAY,Yeah I read it. It didn't go beyond the exterier on Joan. It didn't tell everything. It was still okay but it needed to expand more on the history
2,A Joan of Arc story version that's just okay,"Joan of Arc was a pretty good book. The setting of the story was in France and England from 1429 to1439 The main characters in the book are Joan of Arc, Charles the 8th,and the Duke of Burgundy My favorite character was Joan of Arc because she was brave and was one of the greatest leaders of the French army. My favorite part of this book was when Joan of Arc led the French army. I would recommend this book to people who like history of great leaders. This book would be best for people who like history."
1,OK BOOK,THIS BOOK WAS OK. IF YOU WANT AN OK BOOK THEN READ THIS OK BOOK. OK? BY THE WAY MY NAME IS JARED. I HAVE A MAD HAT ON.
4,In a class by herself,"Gordimer's use of language is beyond what the ordinary story teller employs. Her words are nuanced, metaphorical, and indirect in ways that let you mentally fill in the gaps and is very satisfying to one as the reader. I don't know of anyone who writes quite like her. Her stories are not plot driven and seem to evoke something profound about the characters' humanity that is difficult to describe. There are ordinary situations in some of her stories that are so vividly expressed, that they never leave your mind. Her writing is in a class of its own."
1,Lousy Product- I expected better from Wright,"Although the price is modest at $8, one should still get some value for the expense. Instead, save up for ""Surfer's Guide to Baja"" by Mike Parise. Wright's work is dated and lacks descriptions and directions. The quality of the map is poor-just some folded paper with only major roads. Even if it was free, I'd just use it for starting a fire, it is that useless!"
1,Need TP?,"During my trip to Mexico, the only use for this map was as toilet paper. It doesn't help you find any spots and its so vague that if you do find a good spot, you won't even be able to tell which one it is on the map. I also used surfmaps.com [...]"
3,The Majolica Murders,I really enjoyed the previous books in this series but the ending in this one left me with many questions unanswered and loose ends that didn't make sense.I re-read the last couple of chapters to see what I might have missed but as the previous reviewer stated it all seem a bit muddled. Hopefully Deborah Moragan will get back on track with the next book in this series.
5,Flawless blend,"Deborah Morgan's The Majolica Murders flawlessly combines mystery elements with the tension of a thriller. Although it's easy to assume this series would have perfect appeal to the cozy reader, Morgan avoids the overly precious voice that often causes readers to avoid that category.The fascinating background of the little known world of antique buying and selling thwarts retired FBI agent, Jeff Talbot's efforts to leave his old occupation behind. His new business as a seller and picker of antiquities provides ample opportunity for him to use skills he thought he could leave behind. Great read!Charlotte Hinger"
5,Stolen Petroglyph,"The Wind River mysteries provide the reader with pleasure that is absent in many series after twelve installments. The mystery is intriguing, the writing is tightly paced, the characters still provide surprises by their actions, and the background information is so sound it never reads as a dump, but is finely woven into the story.Two young Arapaho men, working on a ranch, are accused of stealing a petroglyph and Raymond Trueblood dies at the hands of Travis Birdsong. Travis is serving time for the killing, but Vicky Holden and Father John O'Mally believe he is innocent when a second petroglyph is stolen.Nash Black, author of TRAVELERS and SINS OF THE FATHERS."
5,Fabulous!,"Margaret Coel's Windy River Reservation series is wonderful. In this book she explores the dark underworld of trade in stolen Indian artifacts. She builds a plot that keeps the reader on the edge of their seat right until the end. Her characters are very complex and real, and the relationships that she explores betweeen her two main ones, Vicky and Father John grows and changes with each book. In this book Ms. Coel also explores the relationship between Vicky Holden and her partner Adam as Vicky goes out on her own trying to save one of her own people. Adam realizes that if any of the elders come to Vicky for help she simply can't refuse even if it puts her in danger. Margaret Coel is a master and this is one of the best mystery series that you'll find out there today. Intelligent writing with the cutting edge of tension running right through the book."
5,The Drowning Man,Well written book and great characters I am just beginning to know these authors and hope to read more of them in the future.
2,This remote stinks,I've had two of these things and on both of them the volume buttons have broken. I've replaced the batteries many times and neither one works properly. I have no idea what is wrong with them. I'm looking for another remote right now but it will not be an RCA.
4,Dont be fooled. It's not broken.,"The complaints of the last two reviews are what I experienced as well. I've had mine for a very long time. The only reason it fails to work for the TV yet for the satellite, is because this thing rapidly soaks up battery power. And everytime you replace the batteries DO NOT forget to reset it to work for the TV again like you did the first time. ""Code Search"", ""TV"", your TV code, ""TV""...Ta da! It works again. And you can reset it again a few times everytime battery power gets weak until you really have to replace the batteries when reseting fails. It's not a piece of junk! It just eats your batteries hence my 4 stars."
3,Read Description,I would have never paid $20 for a night light that contained a non replaceable bulb had I known it had a non replaceable bulb but there was no mention of this in the description - there was no description. He is cute though.
3,Grable overshadowed by Raye's underpinnings!,"Typical zany 30s comedy tailored to the talents of Bob Hope and Martha Raye. Martha plays a homebody who enters a cake-making competition, but inadvertendly a photograph of her legs is also sent with the cake! Guess what! Martha loses the baking prize but ends up winning the Most Beautiful Legs competition.But it is nice to see Betty Grable (who plays Martha's young sister) in her pre-stardom days, giving us a preview of what was yet to come. She was maturing nicely - without any mention of her celebrated legs. She sings and dances ""What Goes on Here in My Heart"" to the backing of Jack Whiting's Orchestra.Bob and Martha have some fine comedy moments, but Betty is cast here in a strangly unsympathetic role. However all ends happily - as they did in those crazy Thirties comedies. Screwball fun."
3,great book but a little disappointed w/ condition,"It was a gift. The person I bought it for loves the book but it did have areas that someone highlighted. I did buy it used so I guess I should have investigated deeper. But other than that it is a very good book. The funny ( funny now...not then) I bought the book for a man at church and the part that was highlighted was in the erectial disfunction chapter!!! ACKKK!!! Embarrassing at the time, but we are all moving on with our lives (LOL)"
5,Hackers Beware. . . .Expanded !,"'Hackers Beware', is a very useful book, no doubts. But its son: 'Anti-Hacker Toolkit' is by far, the most useful 'practical' book in the area of computer security. Tons. (I do mean Tons.) of cases and scenarios are thoroughly reviewed. Any relevant TOOL (offensive or defensive) is explored, lot of case studies are presented (in depth), and as an added bonus, almost every scenario is discussed both for Windows and UNIX.It is not a theoretical book, it is a real 'learn by understanding how to hack' book. However,even if no too much, you'll need some basic knowledge about the area, to take full advantage of this book.Needless to say the companion CD is, not only multi platform, but FULL of valuable tools.I have reviewed a lot of security books (good books), but this one really impressed me very much.The forensic chapters alone, justify buying the book !!"
3,Hmmmm.,"Does it concern anyone else that every prior review was written with third-grade English?I haven't actually read the book, though it seems to be a re-hash of every other security/hacking/cracking book on the shelf. In fact, virtually every ""hacking"" book on the shelf at Borders and B&N seems to recount the same basic tenets, and yet... still more emerge.I guess I need to write my own book, eh?"
1,Huge Disappointment,"If you are looking for the essential Judy Collins, don't buy this CD. Yes, it is still her fabulous golden soprano voice, but the selections and the arrangements were almost unrecognizable from the Judy I was expecting."
3,Boring,Here voice is great but the songs are boring. Plus these are just another collection of songs she's done before. If you are a fan of slow songs then this is for you but I'll take the originals of all her remakes.
4,"Great sound, solid construction.","Since there are a nearly infinite number of tambourines/jingle combinations, and they all sound different, take this review for what it's worth.This is a great tambourine for live sound/outdoor venues where you need a very bright and strong effect. It is capable of making a LOT of sound, but can still be played with some gentleness to get a slightly more subdued tone. However, if you are looking for a subtle tambourine, then this isn't it!The only complaint I have about this is how the foam grip tends to rotate under my grip when striking my other hand. This causes a momentary change in the angle that occasionally throws off my grip a little bit, resulting in the need to readjust my hand position. I find that if I hold the tambourine with the grip more parallel to the ground, it minimizes the problem. It's just that my preferred playing posture has the grip held vertically most of the time."
4,Great Phone but the reminders are not repeated....,"This is a great phone with cool multimedia features. It has a built in FM Radio but you have to use the supplied head set that has a unique adpater, meaning you cant use anything else. I was hoping that I could use this phone to replace my HP PDA but whe the reminders come up they dont repeat themselves so if you dont hear the reminder you will not be notified again. The vibration is not very hard meaning sometimes you cant feel it if it was in your pocket. The coolest thing I found about it was you can record phone call conversation with ease."
4,I like this CD!,"I like Stephen Bishop and I like this Greatests hits CD, my favorite songs on this are On and On, It Might Be You, and Seperate Lives, and I also have to admit to liking Animal House it is a silly song but I just have always liked it I guess because I like the movie Animal House. I recommend this CD and also Careless which is also a great CD"
4,"Better in some ways, but still not the perfect compilation","Of all the SB compilations issued, this one and the Rhinoone are the best. As fas as the others go, there are justtoo many redundant compilations out there, excluding the'demo' type CD's offered on his website.That said, this compilation is a definite improvement inthe generous liner notes and listings of musicians.But the bad part is that half the tracks here(mostly thehits) are repeats from the Rhino CD. At least there aresome different album tracks and soundtrack songs includedthis time around.Maybe if both of the first two compilations had beencombined into one 2-CD set, it would've been THEdefinitive overview."
3,Not Julian Marsh's best,"Purchased after owning several other Julian Marsh's dance compilations. Music is not bad, but not up to Marsh's other up beat high energy work."
1,awful,Awful kid's story telling the tale of an ugly girl who is made beautiful by a witch and returns to married the humble goatherd who helped her get there.
3,Strange but good.,"I read this book based upon a recommendation in ""Book Lust"" (compendium of recommended reads) and it sounded interesting. It WAS interesting, although the style left me a little jumpy for the first half of the book. I also could not figure out how or why the protagonist got involved with his defendant, but I won't say more. It must have been good since it had me thinking for a long while, but I have read much better stories. It was disturbing, and not entirely unforgettable."
4,Sturdy and much better than anything else I've found,"I've found it surprisingly difficult to find hanging file folder frames that are sturdy and don't fall apart under the weight of files. The ones I got at OfficeMax and Staples (the same style as most of the other ones for sale here on Amazon) were driving me crazy -- the metal and connections were too flimsy to work.I did an extensive search on the Internet, found these, installed them, and they are much better. The plastic ends hold the metal bars well. The metal bars themselves are much stronger than others that I've worked with. The system is still not perfect -- the process of snapping off the ends of the bars to shorten them makes the bar bend a little, which is not ideal. And the part where it connects in the middle can cause your hanging file folders to fall off if you push them over it.Overall, though, these are much better than anything else I've found. If anyone finds something better, please add a comment in response to this review."
1,don't bother unless you're Superman,"The metal bars that hold up the files need breaking off to fit the drawer length. But they are so thick that neither my husband or I could break them. We followed the instructions, but they require Superman strength to snap them at the scored marks. Very frustrating, indeed."
2,"Comprehensive and exhaustive, yet regularly incomprehensible","As a Ph.D. student in Psychology, I had the opportunity to use this book as my primary text for the Fall 1998 semester. The book is replete with research design principles, and illustrates its teachings through examples from past sociobehavioral studies. Unfortunately Mr. Pedhazur has become very cynical about resarch integrity, and a negative tone pervades many of his discussions. Moreover, his writing rambles and frequently becomes difficult to follow. I did not enjoy learning about sociobehavioral research from this book (and know of no one in my class who did). I give it 2 stars only for the book's broad-ranging scope and coverage."
4,A quick reference for psychiatric emergencies,"This poket book is a quick and easy reference for pshysician in an emergency room dealing with psychiatric emergencies. The part that refers to Organic Mental Syndroms (as Delirium and Dementia) is very interesting and useful for general clinical practicers. The mental conditions are divided in alphabetical order, making it easier to search the subjects; and each one describe the diagnostic criteria and guidelines for treatment. This is really an usefull book for the physician in primary care unit."
1,They sent me a different horrible amp,I ordered the amp in the picture and I got sent a different horrible modern one instead. Disgrace.
1,No one should buy this book. It is full of mistakes.,"I have done five of the practice tests, and I have found mistakes in every single one! Now, I'm just a student; I'm not a teacher who's nitpicking at every little thing.Some questions in the practice tests do not have a right answer because of a mistake in either the question or the answer choices. There are mistakes where the answer key differs from the explanation. There are also questions that have glaringly obvious puctuation errors."
2,This kite is not good.,"I just returned the kites. (yes, kites.) We bought 2 from Wal-mart. One of them flew okay, but it was very difficult, even with some good wind. The other kite was horrible. The balance of these kites are terrible. They don't want to glide. The design of the wing span needs to be bigger. What a waste of time. If you want a kite that is easy and fun to fly, then buy yourself a Delta Conyne (Delta Box Kite)."
2,Dissapointed,"I picked this set because it was made in the USA, looked great in the picture and has a lifetime guarantee. It seemed to be a win-win purchase, great product, supporting our country businesses. While the mechanism in the pepper mill seems to be sturdy, the casing for both the pepper mill and salt shaker are questionable at best. The shaker has a crack or glue streak across the top, not sure which, leading to what seemes to definately be a crack. In the package, looked great, as soon as I took it out, a big disappointment. This is going back."
4,An Excellent Scoop on Wicca,"Becca's experience in this book is something that every teen should have. Reading this book really gave me the scoop on Wicca. I never really knew what it was before, but now, I'm glad that I'm no part of it. Jane Vogel did a very good job explaining why we shouldn't have anything to do with Wicca. It's shows that following God is the only way to live and that no matter what, fooling around with demons is not ok."
5,Excellent Job,"Okay..whoever wrote that first review-Okay I'm a virgin! I think that this book is so true to what God tells us in the Bible about Wicca. I don't personally know anyone that is a Wiccan, and they might be persecuted as well, but how many countries have it Illegal to be wiccan? I know of None. But Christianity? Let me tell ya, there are so many in Asia, not to mention other continents. Wicca is seriously bad because you are getting into Witchcraft and that is no with a CAPITAL N by God's Standards and I want to be living my life 100% up to God's expectations. I think that the author of this book, Jane Vogul, along with Susie Shellenburger, the editor of Brio mag and the books did an excellent way of interpeting the Bible into an easier way to understand."
4,Good collection just too brief,"It is a shame that this is probably the only serious attempt MCA made to mine the great Decca archives of country music since the introduction of the compact disc. All the really good stuff out there is from smaller independent labels. But there are some fine gems on this collection and they are the originals. I'm actually writing this to make note that the track list here on Amazon has some mistakes. ""I Never Had The One I Wanted"" is by Claude Gray, not Jack Greene as it says in the list."
2,to many slow songs,this cd as way to many slow songs . THE REASON I BOUGHT THIS CD WAS BECAUSE OF THE SONG WHAT HURTS THE MOST . THERE ARE 2 OR 3 GOOD SONGS ON THE CD.
4,A Great Investment!,"Pros:* Hundreds of different recipes* Easy to follow instructions* Fascinating case studies on people who have changed to a raw food diet.* Lots of practical detail* Alissa covers every angle of preparing and eating raw food!* A treasure to own.Cons:* Alissa's recipes are fantastic, although many seem to include oil, which I'd rather do without. Overall, a terrific buy."
5,At this time...,"this is the best book available on the subject of the raw food lifestyle. As previously stated, it's not only for beginners it's also for the more experienced. Almost any question one would like answered is answered in the pages of this book. It's beautifully photographed, has wonderful recipes, includes testimonials, a 4-day menu plan; information on food combining and sooooo much more. IF you can only afford one book, this would be it AND I'd advise it be read and utilized over and over.Revvellwww.rawretreat.com"
1,waste of money,Just think of a book you bought that you were totally disappointed with and you were all mad because you wasted your money. This is one of those. This book has no value whatsoever. These recipes are free online.
1,Terrible reading,These recipes are promoting bad food combining which is damaging to your health. Goes against what all registered dieticians say.
1,useless book,"This is a very primitive book. Most of the recipes do not follow proper food combining and laden with carbohydrates, sugar and starch. Not good for diabetics or somebody who wants to reduce weight. Waste of money"
4,Huge book...,"Wow, what a huge and bulky book with lots of information and recipes. Some of the recipes are ordinary but there are delicious recipes as well."
4,great raw food recovery,"This lady has taken stock of what a raw food diet can do for your body, her body, and a number of her friends bodies. She has before and after photos and logs of some of the healing crises these people went through. Plus she has about 300 or so recipes for creating delicious alternative meals and snacks to the stuff that's been poisoning you. What I now know about salt I would recommend Amino Acids instead of any kind of salt in her recipes; but she has faithfully adhered to a raw and not fermented or semi-cooked diet and that is what makes the book such a good show and tell-handy to have in the kitchen kind of gem. I lost over a hundred points on my cholesterol, thirty pounds I no longer carry around my waist and thighs, no more blood in the urine, no more getting up in the middle of the night to go to urinate, and my skin got a healthier glow."
2,"""Old School"" Raw Food Recipe disasters","I really want to say I like this book, but I find that all of the recipes that I make are disgusting. I am a great chef and can create wonderful dishes, but when I try one out of Alissa's book, it turns out inedible. Not only are they incredibly involved, they take a lot of patience and planning to get it right. I made the ""amazing"" calzones and they were gross, I never ever want to eat another flax cracker again, and if I hear/read the phrase ""date nut torte"" one more time I'm going to puke.this was my first raw food book, and while it was great for back then, there are better books with better recipes. These recipes don't have many of the luxury ingredients that are available now. I would say buy her second book, I will because it's been getting great reviews. Living on Live Food is too outdated to stand out in the current raw food craze"
3,Can this book be any BIGGER??,"First off, this book is SO big you would think it was packed, but by using glossy thick paper and ALOT of wasted space (supposedly for notes) it wastes alot of paper.Second, I have yet to try a recipe that I have liked. ALOT of nuts and dates, very high in sugar, natural/raw or not, fat and sugar is fat and sugar.Third, to end on a positive note, there is alot of info if you are just starting raw eating with testimonials, however only the ones that had a great experience with it are there, not the ones that didn't feel any different or who actually gained weight from all the fat and sugar. So much for ending on positive note LOL."
5,"Great, but hold off on the plastic dehydrator","I am reading and digesting what is involved in this straightforward book. Wonderful style of writing.My only suggestion would be lean toward stainless steel appliances not plastic. I am weaning plastics out of my life because they are just not safe or healthy. Do your own research on leeching of chemicals.Otherwise, I love the book, the recipes are easy. Can't wait to get a stainless steel dehydrator! :-)Eat well and be safe."
2,"Some good, some bad","There are a few good recipes in this book, a lot of them using a dehydrator, her personal story is interesting but most people in the before-after photos haven't lost a lot of weight, if they've lost a pound at all."
3,"Great info & taste, but not totally healthy","This was my first introduction to raw foods so read the first few chapters cover to cover and tried several of the recipes. Most were VERY good, but the diet didn't give me the tons of energy I'd hoped/read about. After reading more online about the raw diet, I discovered that the majority of the recipes out there are high in fat -- some even moreso than the standard American diet! I'm now looking into the 80/10/10 approach to eating raw for the most part, but plan to still use recipes from this book when I feel like splurging!"
3,Fair,"Honestly? You can live without this book. The information is interesting but all the information found in here can be found online. Not worth the money in my opinion. Also, for all that money, I would have expected more recipe pictures. I was disappointed when I found around 200 pages with no pictures, only recipe text."
3,"Pretty pictures, horrible food","This book is very pretty and well illustrated for a soft cover book. However, I've tried several recipes and they were all pretty bad. Ground nuts will NEVER taste like dairy products, I don't care what combination you mix them in. The only recipes that were edible were some of the sweets. Go figure."
4,A Little Off Thw Wall But You Can Never Go Wrong With Jimmy,"This recording is loaded with crazy songs with the title track being the luniest of them all. Don't get me wrong this is good stuff and Jimmy as usual keeps throwing us many ear catching lyrics. Sometimes Jimmy's efforts in the singing department could be better. However gems like Love In The Library, Quietly Making Noise, Vampires, Mummies, And The Holy Ghost, as well as countless others make this a worthy purchase."
3,Solid Effort,"Buffett had released in five years. Much like the efforts of his later years, it is a solid, but not spectacular album. The first two lengthy songs, ""Everybody's Got A Cousin In Miami"" and the title track are strong Caribbean flavored efforts and other strong numbers include the cover of The Kinks' ""Sunny Afternoon"", ""Six string Music"" and ""Frenchman For A Night"". Missteps include an awful cover of the Grateful Dead's ""Uncle John's Band"", ""Love In A Library"", ""Vampires, Mummies & The Holy Ghost""."
5,Fruitscakes is great,"I enjoyed listening to this vintage Buffett CD. It contains music not heard at his recent concerts.I would recommend it to all Buffett fansMary, a Buffett fan"
3,The Start of Buffett's Long Slide into Mediocrity,"This is the one folks. For all you longtime fans from the '70's (we DON'T call ourselves ""Parrotheads""!) you can stop buying his stuff, starting with this one. From this point onward, Buffett ""sold out"" to commercialism and began to put out tepid, forgettable little ditties. Relegate this and anything onward to the bargain bins."
2,Heard a Whole Lot Better,"This particular CD left me ""cold""--since I began collecting Parrothead music, I've always found at least one song on a CD that made the buy worth it. Not so with this one. It'll occupy it's place on the shelf but it will stay there."
5,ABSOLUTELY MUST-HAVE FOR BUFFET FANS!!!,"""Fruitcakes"" is an absolutely fantastic album. The title song, his cover of the Dead's ""Uncle John's Band"" and ""Quietly Making Noise"" stand among his all-time very best songs. ""Love in the Library"" and ""Lone Palm"" showcase his delightful storytelling and uncanny knack for putting together tunes that stay in your head long after the music has stopped. BUY THIS CD! Along with ""Barometer Soup"", by far his 2 best albums of the '90's.ENJOY! Buy 2 if ya can!!!!"
4,Enjoyable easy read,"The Lost Band is the newest addition to Coldsmith's Trail of the Spanish bit series; but to read this story, it is not necessary to have read the prior books. The entire series is easy to read and enjoyable saga of the changes to a Plains Indian tribe throughout the history of the frontier. Several of the earlier books have mentioned a vacant place at the annual gathering of the tribe; the vacant place is held for a band of the tribe that disappeared generations ago. The Lost Band traces the history of the missing band, from the time the few survivors of a violent raid were captured by another tribe until their reunion with their people many generations later. The novel is actually several inter-related stories following descendents of one woman who in secret kept alive the language, stories and traditions of her people while she was a captive. Very readable (even for those of us who don't read many Westerns!)"
4,SOLVES A MYSTERY!!,"I have read all the Spanish Bit series. In several of the books there was talk of the lost band. A place was left for it when all the other bands got together. I am glad to finally get a story about what happened to it. Don Coldsmith writes good books about ""The People"". A fictional account but is based losely on events of long ago. The lost band was nearly wiped out by Shaved-heads. This is the story of the few that were left and how they taught the customs, language and other aspects of ""The People"" to their children and on down for several generations. Many thought they would be the one to get back and find the original group but it was not to be until a special child was born to lead a small band back to their special place. A good quick read that is enjoyable if you like stories of people of long ago and how they lived and died. It will hold you attention and you will hope someone finally leads the lost band back."
3,Better books out there,"I am an elementary school librarian. While this book has a few good lesson plans, I find the majority of them to be overly simplistic. Also, a lot of the graphics on the reproducibles are of very poor quality."
2,Save your money...,"As a ""busy librarian"" the title drew the money from me in a hurry, but I was disappointed by the lack of depth- lots of coloring! Occasionally I use some of the reproducibles when I have a sub, however the quality of the graphics are poor."
4,Mozart: Piano Sonatas,"Mozart: Piano Sonatas is a 2005 Deutsche Grammophon recording starring pianist Mikhail Pletnev. John Irving has written the music notes. When the booklet claims that the sonatas ""take on new shades and colour"" then one has to be very good as a pianist. Does he succeed? Well, so so. I prefer the classical approach to playing Mozart. To much experimenting is just that. Not a bad recording but not awesome. Still good enough to get 4 out of 5. Recommended. 4/5."
3,Interesting - Not Great,"This was more of a review of Forsyth's works than a biography. I am sure he ""authorized"" this because it reveals so little about him."
3,Forsyth: A Matter of Protocol,"The book by Craig Cabell is good,useful,well researched. It is academic but it is not deep enough. It is not enough for an ""authorised biography"". It doesn't cover most of the biographic aspects of Forsyth's life. Instead of an authorised biography I would label it: ""A first approach,a glipse, to his life and work""."
3,Where's the Jam?,"Was this a Blues Traveler CD? Don't get me wrong, I am all about a band growing and I will buy every BT CD from now until forever, but this CD was nothing like any of the first. To me something was missing (maybe Bobby's free spirit), the CD seemed to take on a love balad super drama type of feel. The highlight track was Eventually, and a couple of others are listenable but for this most part, in my opinion, BT missed big time on this one."
4,To tell you the truth,"As were the first two albums I bought by Blues Traveler, this is their true sound as it should be. A bit rough and unpolished, and yet just perfect!"
4,Good and growing on me.,"I've bought every BT album. Here's my ranking of their previous efforts to give you an idea of my taste.1) Bridge - Might be a bit biased being still relatively new2) Blues Traveler - Great tracks still hold up3) Save His Soul - Very underrated album imo4) Travelers and Thieves - Pretty cool5) Four - Few good tracks destroyed by over-exposure6) Straight on Till Morning - Meh.Obviously, Truth Be Told is most in common with Bridge. Personally, I like the keyboards and Tad on bass. It didn't have as much immediate appeal to me, but I haven't managed to take it out of my cd player. In the long run, I suspect it will end up falling somewhere between numbers 2 and 3 above.Keep rocking BT!"
5,The Blues band is back and better than ever.,"I stopped listening to the Blues Traveler in around 1997. I decided to listen to those loser punk-rock bands. I had the ""Four"" album, and I liked that alot, but I stashed that somewhere. In 2004 I finally bought their album on the way back home. Since then, I've never stashed this cd anywhere. This cd is pure gold baby!"
4,New Explorations,"Blues Traveler manages to do something unique on this album: move forward while getting back to what makes them a great band.Despite line up changes, the band's improvisational spirit, which is at the core of this group's very being, is clearly evident on this album. But the funky new touches - more keyboards, tighter arrangements, make this a compeling listen.Sweet and Broken, co-written by Spin Doctor Chris Barron, is a particular standout."
5,One of the best albums of all time!,"I just logged on to amazon to see if there were any different versions of ""Sweet Soul Dream"" than the one on the album. I was amazed to see so few reviews of this album. If you are considering buying this, I would recommed it at 10 times the price (literally). I consider it to be one of the all-time great albums; truly awe-inspiring. Karl Wallinger deserves a lot more credit for this masterpiece."
5,Killing Two Birds With One... Equalizer,"Installation was a bear. But this was due to my vehicle's wheel configuration, and the not the product. Now that the equalizers are on, maintaining good, equal pressure is a breeze - instant visual identification of the current pressure status, and simple, one-stop inflation for both tires."
4,Best Disposable Washcloth We Found,"Used for an ill family member, these were the most sturdy and did the best job of any others. Most others we tried fell apart or were too small. While you can't flush them, it wasn't a problem for our needs. They have a slight fragrance which is not unpleasant, but lingers longer than I'd like. These are good for adults because of the size."
3,Not flushable...,"Beware that these are not flushable. Otherwise, they are sturdy and they work well. They don't dry out too quickly when the box lid comes loose."
2,Good sound quality but unreliable,"I bought these headphones a year ago and they've broken two times since. Thankfully they're under warranty, but it's a huge hassle to send them back. I'd recommend the Bose headphones over these, I've had them for 6 months with no issues."
1,ETYMOTICS HF2 ARE MUCH BETTER,"I WAS A SHURE FAN, HAD BOUGHT THREE DIFFERENT ONES AND I LOVED THEM BUT FOUND A DEFECT WITH THE RUBBER COVERING THE WIRES...SENT THEM TO SURE JUST SHOWING THE DEFFECT, AND THEY SENT ME A BILL INSTEAD OF A THANK YOU NOTE...HAD BOUGHT ANOTHER PAIR WHICH I RETURNED, AND THEN THROUGH REVIEWS FOUND THE ETYMOTICS...AND WOW...I LOVE THEM A LOT MORE...SHURE JUST LOST A CUSTOMER...CHECK OUT THE ETYMOTICS HF2YOU CAN EVEN HAVE CUSTOM FITTED EARBUDS ...AMAZING"
1,what a disappointment,"I don't know if I got a bad pair or if they are just not worth the money. Music sounds awful, tinny and shallow. Tried them on several devises and have been totally disappointed. A pair of Sony's that came free with a $30.00 radio sound better."
2,Highly overrated headphone,Better choice for the money was the etymotic e6 isolators.For a budget headphone that is equally good try Panasonic's RP-HJE50
4,Mixed feelings...,"I agree with one reviewer, the price / hype of these made for something of a disappointment. I can make more areas of the music then I have ever before, but the bass is rather flat. But, like another reviewer said, you can't hear jack outside of the earphones. That piece is amazing; I really mean you can't her anything."
4,great earphones,My old Shure E2s were at the end of their rope (insulation off part of one ear) and I wanted more iosolation. [...] highly recommended these and I agree.
4,Sure are good. Shure SE310,"This is my second pair of Shure headphones. As usual the fit and seal are excellent. The sound stage, clarity and detail are phenomenal. My only complaint is with the ported bass I was hoping for more bass without the need for equalization which is not always available with portable devices like my Droid. But after a few minutes of listening you acclimate to the sound and don't miss the lack of bass prominence, because the sound is there, just not as strongly as I would like with some rock music."
5,Fabulous!,"Agree w/ Martin P's review of 12/31/07 except would give the SE310's a five star rating and think the foam earplugs are superior to the rubber. Am in love w/ these, so sorry I didn't get them a long time ago!"
3,Almost too subtle and soft!,"Given the very deft hand behind the lens, this was almost too subtle and soft to leave a deep impression. It is an interesting story, but never totally leaps out and grabs you by the throat, leaving you to only minorly care what happens in the end. The production quality is overall well done, and the acting is near flawless, but not fully engaging."
2,"great actors, thin plot","I was disappointed, considering the array of talent. The plot seemed labored, as if the actors were trying to give it more substance than it had. It barely stimulates enough emotion to warrant a review at all. YAWN!!!"
5,Audio Y adapter - great for earphones.,This adapter allows users to use earphones with their PC even though speakers are taking up that connection. I've been looking for this gizmo for months because it's hard to reach the audio plug in the back of PCs. It helps when working in cubicals. Glad it is available through Amazon. It is hard to find otherwize.
5,Every few years....,"...a book comes along that shakes up they way people look at the world. I can count on one hand the books I've read in my lifetime that fall into this category. This is one of them.Read it, re-read it, and buy copies for your friends. It's that good."
5,Excellent,"A fast, fun, fascinating read. Five stars.I ran into the book in the computer books dept at Borders. Interested, I picked it up, and before long, I was hooked.Hawkins takes a critical look at A.I. progress, identifies key tactical problems, and turns to the biology for a solution. In the process, the reader learns a lot about cognition, neuroscience, and philosophical implications. Although the book has been criticized as speculative, the book includes an appendix of testable predictions.The terse and lucid prose makes the ideas accessible, all the while constantly providing tangible, concrete analogies. Hawkins delivers enjoyable and tasty food for thought. You'll find yourself questioning long held beliefs about your own thought processes. Although, having no formal knowledge of neuroscience, and little knowledge of A.I., I question whether Hawkins fairly portrays both sides of the story."
4,Excellent book,"Although the details of his theory might not be exact, the theory definitely sheds some light on how the brain might *actually* work.Hawkins provides, based on other discoveries, a framework of thinking for the layman. Without requiring deep understanding of neurons molecular behavior (well explained in ""In Search of Memory"" by Kandel), he illustrates some really bright ideas on how they all connect together to create intelligence.BTW, in an interview to The Brain Science Podcast, Hawkins says that he understands now better the mechanic details of the brain. I'm curious on what those new details are."
4,"Thought provoking, easy read",Interesting ideas that pass the Occam's Razor test with a simple hypothesis about how the brain works. More discussion on where free will (or lack there of) fits in would be useful.
4,Best Intelligence Primer ???,"The first half looks at the organic brain machine. It makes sense out of the myriad of informational facts we have about the mind. Hawkin's kind of takes the jigsaw puzzle and creates the outer edge of the picture.Artificial intelligence and raw power computation get hammered in the 2nd half as way to simplistic. The brain seems to solve the most complex problems in <200 steps vice terraflops of calculation. For the brain, simple is better. For computation, complex iterations yielding ambiguity seem like a dead end.The second half is not an easy read. The first half is worth the price of the time."
1,going nowhere,"The best thing that Hawkins can do is (continue to) funnel some of his wealth to real scientists doing real research on neuroscience and cognitive science. Him writing books is not going to help the field.I came away feeling like Hawkins wrote a book to drum up interest in his company. The company will undoubtedly turn out some tech product that falls (far) short of Hawkins ""real intelligence"" (a *really* ridiculous choice of words, by the way).If a nobody had written this book, it might not have been published. If Hawkins had submitted his work (in chunks) to a peer-reviewed scientific journal, I am certain that it would have been soundly rejected for making broad claims with little evidence. Overbroad, overly optimistic claims were a large reason that classical AI was disappointing to many, why neural nets have fallen in and out of favor repeatedly, and why Hawkins interest in cognitive science is worth only the research dollars he can shell out."
1,Nothing to see here,I barely made it through half of the book. That was plenty enough to see he had little to offer beyond inventive self-congratulation.
2,"Excessively speculative, doubtful claims","I read the whole book and was disappointed. The author's claims about the human brain are excessively speculative, doubtful and overly simplistic.It almost seems as though the author has a grudge against the research community. The book has the tone of ""the research community doesn't know what it's talking about, I do and he're _MY_ (brilliant) idea"".I can not recommend this book."
5,An Intelligent and Readable Book on Intelligence,"Jeff Hawkins is the founder of Palm Computer, and the inventor of the Palm Pilot and Treo. After making his fortune, Hawkins turned his attention to neuroscience. Given that history, I was afraid that this book was only published because Hawkins is rich, successful and presumed smart. In fact, Hawkins is smart. More importantly, he has some very good ideas about how the brain works, and he presents them in a clear and concise way. This is an excellent book.Hawkins presents a theory of how the brain makes predictions. Questions that are easily solved are solved at a lower level. If they cannot be solved, they move up to the next level -- something like. I'll let Hawkins explain it. He does a much better job.""On Intelligence"" could easily have been titled ""How the Mind Works."" In fact, that title is taken by another wonderful scientist and writer, Steven Pinker. The two books have very little in common after that. I highly recommend both."
5,algebra in the antarctic,When in deepest darkest Antarctica I would love to have my algebra tutor volume to study. ....check your search engine.
3,"Jimi is spectacular, but this release is flawed.","I'll keep it brief: every rock fan should hear this performance, as it is a virtuoso work. The big HOWEVER is that whoever re-mastered/re-mixed this performance PIPED IN MASSIVE CROWD NOISE DURING THE SONGS. It's total fakery; listen to Star Spangled Banner and you'll know what I mean. Jimi performed at Woodstock very early Monday morning. Most of the crowd had left and the few that remained were definitely vocal, but not to the levels that this CD portrays. I am replacing this with the new release and hope the same flaw is not there."
3,Wait for the new one,It is a good recording but the new one will be better.I have this one but I will still buy the new one.
4,Good East Coast Doo-Wop,The Fi-Tones never really hit it big nationally but were popular along the East Coast.They have a great sound with gliding harmonies and great leads.There's mostly ballads here but there are a couple of fun up-tempo numbers too.The remastered sound is startlingly bass heavy on a couple of cuts but otherwise sounds good.The liner notes are good but the printing is a bit small and hard to read.
5,I am shock!!,"I have never been a Sara Evan fans until now. I have most of her cd, but nothing is as good as this cd! I disagree with some of the people on here saying that this is unorginal and hope that Sara doesn't make another restless cd! This i couldn't disagree more, I believe every song on this cd is better that the song ""born to fly"". So far i have not got tire of any song like in her other cds. An almost perfect cd, with the exception of a song ""big cry"", which i did not like at all. IF you like pop mix with country, then this the best album to start with.5 star to Sara Evan, and hopefully she does not go back to her other cds."
2,Extremely Disappointing,"I LOVED Sara Evans since her duet with Vince Gill, and thought ""Born to Fly"" was one of the best, most authentic albums I have heard in a very long, long time.Perhaps that is why I am so disappointed in Restless. The hits from the radio are on there, sure. But, the rest is so bad I am actually embarassed for her! None of the songs have that origionality and instead sound like something an amateur songwriter would write.I love you Sara, but let's hope you never go back to the ""Restless"" Period."
1,Eh,"Overall, I am not happy with the CD, but I love ""Suds in the Bucket"". The rest of the songs are not good, the lyrics are childish. I am very dissappointed because her voice is incredible, why does she sing such uninteresting songs? Her voice is too good to waste on dumb songs."
2,Not Sara's best in my opinion,"I love all three of Sara's previous albums, but not this one! I think her voice is best suited for traditional country music, but the fans were not responding to her first two, so she had to go in the direction of pop to avoid getting dropped by her label. Personally, I think Born to Fly was a coherent, fun album for her to be proud of, and I love it. I do not feel the same about Restless. If it were just the cross over factor, I could get over it, but it's not. It sounds too much like everything else coming out of Nashville: inauthentic songs that are made to get airplay and forgotten 5 minutes later. If she was going for sales with this, as she has admitted she has, I guess she succeeded. I hope she tries for quality next time around. She's got an amazing voice which just is not used to it's fullest here,"
5,Sara Sounds Great To Me,"Having only been recently exposed to Sara Evans, I have no knowlage of her past work, which I see is quite a bit. Taken on that note, I think this CD is great. I love her voice, and I do not object to the song choice at all, as I see one professional reviewer did. The songs just flow nicely together, and is a very pleasent listen, and now am ready to buy another Sara Evans CD, and hope to get an opportunity to see her in concert someday."
2,where is the fast forward button?,"I liked two songs on this album, Suds in the bucket and Backseat of a grehound bus. I found myself shipping through all of the other songs."
4,Not Restless at all,"Well, Sara has done it again. I loved it from the first listen and it only gets better with every listen. The first seven tracks are incredible and all could be big country hits. Even though ""Backseat Of A Greyhound Bus"" hasn't really caught on with radio yet (only top 20)it is catchy and very easy for any parent to relate to. My favorite tracks would be ""Niagara"", ""Perfect"", ""To Be Happy"", ""Need To Be Next To You"" & "" I Give In"". Overall, a very solid country album with strong production (can you really overproduce an album?) and definitely variety."
4,Very nice...,"I picked this CD up on a whim when I had some extra money. I'd heard her songs ""Perfect"" and ""Suds in the Bucket"" on the radio and loved them both, so I figured the entire CD would be just as great. While there are a couple of songs I usually skip over while I'm listening (specifically ""Rockin' Horse""; I can't even listen to that song) the rest of the tracks make up for it."
4,What a talent!!,"This CD has a great range of emotions and tempos, proving how versatile Sara Evans really is. All of the songs have positive messages and her wonderful voice bring them to life. First up is the Troy Verges penned ""Backseat of a Greyhound Bus"", a touching story of shame, escape, life and hope. ""Feel It Coming On"" is a great, sassy song and ""Big Cry"" (a very true song about the cleansing powers of a good crying jag) has a very blues-y vibe. ""Need to be Next to You"" is a wonderful ballad and ""Perfect"" is an upbeat romantic song. ""Suds in the Bucket"" is an awesome swinger about a small town shaken up woman who lights out of there for something better, it is my favorite song on the CD. ""To Be Happy"" is fun, positive song about making lemonade when life hands you lemons and ""Restless"" is mid-tempo, with a cool Celtic tin whistle. This is by far one of the best country CDs to come out in 2003!"
3,"Good, but needs improvement","At the time I bought a few pairs of the Bridgedale Endurance Trail socks for an upcoming deployment to Afghanistan. I am now six months into the deployment. The socks fit well and are very comfortable. They are light for the hot Afghan summer. My feet don't blister and they don't smell bad either. The socks dry quickly and don't have any lasting odor once dry. The only problem I have had with them is that they fall down my calf. There is only a small portion at the top that has elastic material and it ends up slipping down and annoying me. I prefer socks with elastic all the way up the calf. I also bought Keen Boulder Canyon and Smartwool mid cushion crew socks. The Smartwool have been the most comfortable, but wear out quickly. The Keen have been the best overall."
4,Good sock for eevryday use,"These socks are great, though they are not suited for extended use in the cold. They are great to wear while I am at work since it can be a quite cold in my office."
4,Are you LIVING with cancer?,"I gave this book to my grandmother. It has tips on dealing with nasea, how to prepare food so it doesn't taste metalic, etc... Lots of real and useful information for getting proper nutrition. My grandmother wasn't in the right frame of mind to accept the information. Good food will greatly contribute to our health and well being, I'm sad she could not allow herself this. It is a great book without being to new agey- after all it's by America's kitchen sweetheart, Betty Crocker. How more traditional can you get? Best of health to you and yours."
2,Disappointing!,"This book was very disappointing for me. Some of the information contradicted itself regarding nutropenia, which made me suspicious of the content of other topics. I have only tried one of the recipes and didn't care for the taste."
1,Poor Choice,The ingredients do not go hand and hand with a cancer diet. Not enough organics. Also white sugar should not be used in many of the receipes. I purchased this hoping it would help me in my fight. I can't use many of the receipes because of the ingredients.
1,"Some good, but much bad","The information about cancer basics, the side effects of cancer treatments, and the foods that would be appetizing to a cancer patient were well done, but many of the recipe's ingredients should not be part of a modern, purportedly-healthy cookbook. I am referring to ingredients such as: creamed, canned soups; packaged onion soup mixes; bacon flavored bits; and processed cheese spread loaf."
4,Betty Crocker's Living with Cancer Cookbook,"Have always loved Betty Crocker, this book is fantastic with the simple, tasty and nutritious recipes. Love it!"
2,is it toxic?,"i put this on my dog's rash. he must of licked some because he was throwing up for two days afterwards. i thought this spray was supposed to be all natural, but it makes my dog puke his gutts out, and the back of the bottle says if you get it on your skin or injest it, to contact poison control!"
5,A grooming staple in my house!,I've been using this product for years on my Pomeranian and have been extremely pleased with it! After bathing and blow drying I spritz this product on and rub it in with my fingers. It helps condition her skin and coat and leaves her smelling wonderful for weeks after her bath! Keep in mind that a little goes a long way with this stuff! I highly recommend it!
3,Tea tree oil,"I dont if it works because my dog still scratch and whenever i spray it on he roll like crazy lol it seems like he doesnt like the herbal scent, but I hope it'll help him from itchiness"
4,Earthbath Vanilla Almond Spritz,Product smells better than the dog inbetween baths. Works good. Doesn't last as long as I would like.
5,EARTHBATH lavender deodorizer - the best,I don't understand why Petsmart or Petco took this brand out of the shelves.this is my favorite scent for my dog. she always smells good at all times .love this product.
3,MCA What were you thinking?,"Folks,Loretta Lynn is a 5 star Legend. I bought the boxset, and enjoyed it, BUT I give it 3 stars because:1. Loretta has sang for decades (Is that all the songs you could come up with?).2. Not Enough duet songs with conway Twitty.3. Packaging is lousy and not showing enough respect to our beloved Legend.It is shameful to know that the Great German company ""Bear Family Records"" continues to show more respect to Amercian Country music. Buying their box sets is truly a joy. Music sounds great, large number of songs, and the packaging is worth the price on it own.Thanks,Nawaf"
2,Poor technical support,"All of the software works great, except for I-spy reading which I receive an error. I was told several times that to get the software to work, I would need to remove some RAM or lower my virtual memory. I tested on two of my other computers and it works normally. My kids' love the software, but it seems to have some bugs that Scholastic is unwilling to resolve."
2,Not very educational,"This may be kindergarten material, I am not sure. My 6 year old will play it but its not very challenging and doesnt challenge him or seem to teach him anything. This one was cheaper, however we will be trying another brand."
5,good logic,"The book which was written for a Ph.D of M.R. Chinchore who got reward on it. it is a good book for those who wanna study Buddhist philosophy, especially on Buddhist logic. It shows a unique logic of Buddhism and how is different between of other's at that time. reading it we will come to know how Dharmakirti shows us buddhist thoery of momentary, non-self... by virtue of logic"
5,immmature greatest cd is this one every song on it goes off,never lie & constantly are my all time favirotes
5,Still Love It!,"Twelve years after this album was released I still love it. ""Never Lie"" is still one of my favorite songs and I still get the same tingly feeling inside when I hear it as I did when I was 14. This CD, for me, is another classic I will never let go of."
5,Works well (20K Ohms/Volt) and does seem pretty accurate especially on the low Voltage scales,It's pretty easy to read. I have nothing against DMMs. I just wanted a decent VOM on my bench and I wanted my students to see and read an analog meter at least once or twice.
5,An excellent introduction to Sherlock Holmes,"My husband requested an audio edition of fiction by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. This collection arrived a few days after I ordered it from Amazon. It is a wonderful reading of several of Doyle's Sherlock Holmes stories. David Timson is a masterful reader who creates a mood and makes each character recognizable. For my part, I recently purchased a CD Walkman, and now I can go about my chores while enjoying classic mysteries."
5,Beautiful Video To Savor and Share,"I love this video ! It is a beautiful and well-done film about a young girl visiting her aunt, and the fun time they have building a fairy house in the woods. If you have enjoyed the Fairy House books, this will be right up your (woodland) alley. It is not an instructional video per se, but after watching it you will have enough of an idea of how to build your own fairy house that you can just dive right in. The pace is somewhat slow, which is a real treat as an alternative to the intense so called 'children's films' that Disney and the other studios crank out. No imminent danger, no families separated by tragedy or death. Just a nice relationship between a woman and a girl, and the enjoyable experience they share. A treat."
4,The perfect book - small letter size.,"Love this book, but the letter size is a bit small, especially under images, for reading. I would give 5 stars if the letter size would have been bigger."
2,Slightly outdated,"The author of this book had not even been married for a year when this was written, so it's difficult to take him as a guiding authority on the subject. This book seemed chock full of stock cliches, rather than being an actual wellspring of useful advice to deal with practical problems. Chapters are devoted to long, drawn-out stories that DESCRIBE problems couples inevitably face (topics include in-laws, sex, living together, etc.) However, he never delves into HOW to solve/deal with them.I found some of the anecdotes included of actual married couples slightly amusing, which is the only reason this isn't getting one star."
5,Perfect for newley engaged couples,"My fiance and I are planning a long engagement. Both of us wanted to be sure we were right for each other. We looked for books to try and help us to prepare ourselves for the big change in our lives. This book was the answer. It told us what to expect, and what to accept as reality. It didn't try to fluff the ideas of marriage as perfect and what every person should do as other books I read. It contains numerous accounts from actual married couples. I think this is the perfect book for anyone who is even considering marriage."
4,Great vignettes,"Although I'm still of the mind that only marriage can prepare one for marriage, I very much enjoyed Pesmen's many vignettes of newly wed couples. I especially appreciated the author's own personal narratives on marriage.Good wit, good expert testimony. My only disappointment was that that the author never delved further into the really tough issues.In short, nice work."
4,One of Ti Lung's best,"If you're a fan of Kung Fu, then this is a movie for you. Along with ""Avenging Eagle"" this is one of Ti Lung's best and I recommend it highly. Action and drama combine for an exciting film experience and the final fight scene makes it well worth of the price of admission alone."
3,Of limited Appeal,I partially agree with what has already been written. This title is badly named and has very little to do with BMW coupes. However it does provide a good general history of the company and all the cars up to about 1970. It does not have any significant technical specs however its still a good starting point for those who arnt experts or something a little different for those that are. Not for everyone but still alot of people will enjoy it and Im glad I bought it.
2,BIG KNIFE,"I was disappointed with the knife. I expected it to be a ""Case"" knife. it would make a good gag gift, because it is certainly unusual. As it turned out my brother liked it, so I gave it to him. I think it could have been described a little better. Probably my fault, tho."
3,play yard,Cosco Funsport Play Yard Circle SafariIt's a nice playard but the buttons to collapse it are hard to push.
2,Not quite it,"I had hoped that this would be it, the One, the mandolin I keep. It's going back, though, because the permanent blades responsible for the success of the cutting operation aren't sharp enough to consistently cut. Super sharp replaceable blades in different sizes are great, but half the equation is in the permanent blades. These are too dull to complete a good cut...so dull that the operation becomes quite dangerous, even with the provided pusher. Overall the unit is high-quality and sturdy. If a little extra attention had been put into the blades the high price tag would have been acceptable, but because of the dullness of important blades, this mandolin doesn't perform any better than the 35 dollar version rendered in plastic. Too bad!"
2,Contender-Disappointment,"The Contender movie had some great musical pieces with a broad number of instruments. The soundtrack is all piano arrangements with some strings, not what was played in the movie. The producers of this CD really missed the boat on this one. The DVD has better music from the movie than the soundtrack CD. The composer Larry Groupe is talented and I look forward to hearing more of his work. The CD soundtrack should be withdrawn and reissued with the music that was played in the movie as it was played in the movie."
2,Where is That opening Song?,I love the song the movie opens with. Why is it not included on the soundtrack?
5,Contender/deterrence double the pleasure,"These are both excellent films and excellent scores. Thank god the ring of fire song was not included. This Cd is pure score. A soundtrack Cd is for the songs in a movie. A score CD by design does not contain any of the pop songs. The two scores show a deep command of the political musical genre. An excellent double header. The Contender score does contain more than piano selections, if your copy does not then someone switched out the CD."
1,No Ring of Fire?,"This is a great movie with an excellent soundtrack. After six years of searching I still cannot find the Carnes / Bridges duet anywhere. I would have purchased the soundtrack if ""Ring of Fire"" was included, as I'm sure many would have. My one star is for that reason alone. The movie however is a five star at least."
2,Opening Song,"I've searched and searched trying to find the performer of the opening song from the movie. I believe it is a Cash remake ""Ring of Fire."" I enjoyed the movie The Contender and thought the soundtrack would include the opening piece. Can anyone tell me who that is?"
3,Disappointing Range,The unit works great as along as you are within about a mile of each other. I really don't know where they the 15 mile range from. We traveled about 1600 miles with two vehicles (one a moving truck). We ended up relying way more on our cell phones because they didn't offer the range we were expecting.
2,The Title Does Say It All,"The movie starts with an insecure slacker asking hypothetically (on a camping trip), what would his rich girlfriend say if he asked her to marry him. She remains silent and emotional. The remaining 80 minutes or so plods along,mostly focusing on how they react in a crisis. Umm..after 10 minutes you want to scream and tell the pretty girl ""Just Say NO"". The man-boy pretty much offers more and proof as to why ""NO"" should be the answer.The sci-fi disaster film motif is totally a vehicle to dissect this ill-fated relationship. It is ""watchable"" especially as a free movie on Amazon Prime.The Swiss film (from the 1970's) LE RETOUR D'AFRIQUE (RETURN FROM AFRICA) by Alain Tanner is funnier, and more satisfying. ""Empty"" isn't shallow, the characters are developed well enough, however it could have been subtitled ""10 Days at the End of the World, with a guy my Dad said was worthless"" Daddy's right this one time."
4,A nice debut,"This is Mason Schraufnagel's first novel, and I think a good one. It's a story of two people, Natalie and Jason, who get in a car accident, discover a meteorite, and run away to Memphis together. The story promotes happiness and is the ideal road trip. They're off to see/listen to the blues. The story sets up some drama, since Natalie's father reports it as a kidnapping and two detectives aren't sent after to arrest Jason.I recommend this book to those who've ever been unhappy in their situations and just feel like taking off. It seems to be about life in that sense. It's very much the grass is always greener type of thing.Anyway, it's a very good first attempt and should be readable for any age and enjoyable to the same. It's not all that big and most could read it in just a couple days. it's worth it."
4,worth the money,"I have been using this seat for quite a while now and have had no problems from it. It is well built and sturdy.I half expected for it to have a tear or two in it by now, but surpriseinhgly there are none.I mounted this seat on a jon-boat that I leave outside on the lake in direct sunlight.I can notice no sun fadeing or rotting. My only complaint is that I would like to have some more foam for cushioning.I think most will be pleased with this seat."
4,Another fine book by a master comedian,"It is so difficult to write a sustained comic novel. Yet David Lodge continues to master the form, this being one of many such as NICE WORK. There are metaphors about ""paradise"" and a quite sweetly sentimental romance amidst a hilarious satire on vacations and tourist destinations (in this case, Honolulu). But with it all, there is an embracing tolerant affection for his characters, and a genuine unpretentious intelligence at work here."
5,Sensative. Inspirational. Motivaitonal. Full of Love,"Hilda moves quickly through her traumatic experiences and closes each chapter with words of wisdom she gleaned from each one. She never belabors the hardships, for her message is about growing through perseverance, forgiveness and love. This book is a must for anyone feeling stuck in a hopeless situation. Her own triumphant nature and belief in the power of love is an example for everyone to follow."
4,Must-Have for a fan,"Although this recording of a neglected work in the G&S canon is not perfect, it is invaluable. To the best of my knowledge it is only one of two (the other out of print) that uses the entire score including the unabridged overture and Act II finale, and the Act II patter song ""Henceforth All the Crimes."" It also includes all the dialogue -- filling an unfortunate gap in the D'Oyle Carte's series of recordings with dialogue. The performances are a bit campy for my taste -- comedy is funnier when the actors don't let on they know they're being funny -- and Mad Margaret and Richard in particular are sometimes over the top.I also missed some traditional touches, such as the interpolations in ""My Boy, You May Take It From Me."" Everyone is in fine voice, though, and most important, they have fun with it -- it isn't taxidermified as so much G&S is. It won't replace your Martyn Green or George Baker, but if you like Ruddigore, you will want it on your shelf."
3,a letdown - really mostly for TV series writing,"I was disappointed in this book since it focussed almost exclusively on creating TV series scripts, and drew virtually all examples from one of Scott's Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles scripts. When it comes to features, there's only a small chapter and Scott basically says 'Forget about it - no film scripts have ever been bought from outside a studio - they're only developed in-house by execs.' There's also only one paragraph devoted to creating 'direct-to-video' projects, and no mention whatsoever of strategies for writing for independent films or any less 'orthodox' ways to get your work seen and developed.Given all the other glowing reviews I read, I expected more."
4,Very Helpful,"This title is very informative. From actually writing the script, to the proper layout, to writing with intent, I learned a lot. It even has a sample script with art that you can use for reference"
3,A City Girl's Review,"Being a woman who only hunts for bargains at the shopping mall, Brian's collection of stories opened a different world to me. His stories placed me right in the mind and boots of a hunter at various stages in his life. How they reason, respond in crisis, interact with others, and their humor. These are lively stories to tell when you are sitting around the campfire. Brian gave beautiful detailed descriptions of the great outdoors that would inspire anyone to hop in a 4-wheel drive and head to the Pacific Northwest. I personally can say I will never look at a handful of tadpoles the same."
1,Photo is deceiving,"You only get the flat pad, not the contraption that holds the pad and what is pictured. That is what I needed, so this is completely useless to me."
1,Misleading photo,"In the photo in the listing it shows the pad attached to the lower part of the tube for the painter. What I got was just the pad - unfortunately I had discarded the lower tube, so the pad is now useless."
3,Wagner deckmate replacement pads,I recently replaced the paint pad on my deckmate only to end up not using it as the paint does not flow properly through the plastic head as it did when it was new. If i was to purchase any thing for this product again it would be the entire plastic head and paint pad together.
3,Deck Mate replacement paint pads,"The replacement pads fit well, but only last for one painting session before coming apart from the main pad holder."
3,Eccentric or just plain nuts?,"The Disappearing Duke definitely falls into the ""truth is stranger than fiction"" category. The fifth Duke of Portland, head of an immensely powerful and rich British family apparently lived a double and perhaps triple life,leading to the most scandalous case of infighting among ostensible heirs and court case of the early 20th century in Britain.As Duke of Portland, he led a reclusive life occupied by extensive building on the estate. As his alter ego,Thomas Druce,he married twice and produced two separate families.The fighting between the groups led to madness and financial ruin for several of the family members.This is a fascinating story,but I found the novelistic approach to the material a bit diconcerting.There was much dialogue that was apparently not supported by any sources other than the authors' imagination. That being said, it was entertaining and at least an accurate representation of the power possessed by the British aristocracy of the time."
1,Great Meter / Insane price,"This item shown at $40 and claims list price of $69.Actual list price is around $35 and item is readiy available discounted from that priceMeter is very good and most convenient on the market. Now, they should market small, cheap lancing device to go with it."
5,A cigar smokers must have item.,"Bought this when my old cutter finally bit the dust. Rock solid construction, razor sharp, light weight. Cuts 60 ring cigars with no problem. Perfect even cut every time.The best cutter I have ever owned.I would say I would buy it again, but I do not think I will ever have to purchase another cutter...I will probaly get leave this one to my Grand kids in my will...in about 30 years.**UPDATE** Well after a one year long deployment to Afghanistan, and close to 900 cigars, the cutter is just as sharp as the day I took it out of the package. Nice clean, crisp cuts every time. Only problem, the finish has started to wear a little on the body, but what do you expect from somthing that has been covered in sand, and taken in and out of my pocket thousands of times. If you are a serious cigar smoker, then you must have one of these."
4,Quality cutter,"When I first took it out of the package you could just feel the quailty of the build. It opens with a very satisfying sound, and cuts wonderfully. Would have given it 5 stars, but it sticks sometimes when opening."
5,Xikar x1 titanium cutter,"Xikar Best company I've seen. They want you back and happy my humidor is maintained by xikar crystals and I just purchased the xikar rectangle hygrometer, I've also been using a xikar crossover lighter and now I've got the cutter! Great product look forward to a nice enjoyable Long use from these top shelf products from Xikar."
4,Top of It's Class,"This is a very nice table for it's class. It is much nicer than the Christmas tables you see at Wal-mart or Target. The setup was straight forward with good instructions. The slatron plays great with no sags or hills. The slatron is very light, therefore the table itself is rather light (< 300 lbs). Also, the slatron sounds different than slate."
5,Spectacular,"Finally, I got around to the Shackleton story, and this Nova TV documentary seems to do it right. At two hours, there is plenty of fascinating detail. What struck me were the professional quality films and photos that survived the ill fated voyage. You will think this is recreation, but it's not. It's real. Watch this if you can find it at your library."
3,10/22 mag holder,"Difficult to attach mags. Mags do all off under fire when using fully loaded clips. Great concept, maybe item needs more engineering."
3,Fair product,"From what I can see, the 2- and 4-mag holders need glue to hold them together. I just bought a TriMag off of eBay instead and everything holds together NICELY!!! Great concept, but better engineering is needed."
4,Pocket Reference Worth Owning,"For any admin who struggles with the day to day issues of securing their network, this is a must have guide to help you address your holes.With most guides, you receive only a quick overview of potential problems. With this guide, you not only get the ""what's"" but the ""how's"". All this in a compact, well thought out reference.I would definitely recommend this book for any security conscious administrator.Now if we could only get the users to read this."
3,Gift Perfume,I bought this for my sister and she received it in good condition and she likes the fragrance.
2,Not as Good as Expected!,"I had to purchase the book because of the General Biochemistry course that I took at school. Although it is a well-written book, it does not provide the materials that are covered in our class. I do not even know why this book is required for an upper-division general biochemistry course! In other words, the book is very superficial and does not have enough substance.Moreover, there are a lot of errors in the answer key section. You can pay slightly more and buy Lehninger Principles of Biochemistry, but at least you would have something that you can learn from. I would not recommend this book."
2,Ehhhhhh,"OK...lets just get this out of the way: I didn't like this book. It has a lot of potential, but the chemistry part of it was a bore. It was hard to find what I was looking for, hard to follow, and it seemed like a lot of sections repeated themselves or just weren't clear. At least it can be had used for cheap..."
3,not a bad text,The text could have expanded on some topics. I recommend the Voet and Voet text. Had to purchase this text because few of its authors were from the university I attend.
3,Use this book if you plan a traditional job search,"I reviewed this book for Learning A Living; A Guide to Planning Your Career and Finding A Job for People with Learning Disabilities, Attention Deficit Disorder and Dyslexia. Here is what was in the Annotated BibliograpyA comprehensive book on searching for vacancies rather than creating a job.Exercises to determine career interests, networking, interviews, and handling offers. Recommends that you contact people to review your plan for marketing your career. Suggests win-win negotiating techniques for salary negotiating. Most forms do not work for people who have dyslexia or learning disabilities."
3,"Versatile, but not without some quality reduction.","I liked the product. It is versatile, compact, easy to use and has a pretty nifty remote. It can convert from just about any source - including s-video, component & even VGA. But on conversion, the projection lost its sharpness. Images are still very legible. However the slight blur can be a bit annoying."
5,Better than expected.,I recently purchased a media device that required both simultaneous tv and internet connection to perform upgrades. I used the product to connect the media device to my computer monitor that is also in close proximity to my internet connection. It worked like a charm.
4,Kind of liked,"I bought 2 of these, one of the two had a crack on the bottom, so I exchanged it, the second one cracked when I used it the first time. I do use one of them when we have people over and get lots of compliments on how cute it is. It works great, I just hate the fact that I had two different cracks on them."
5,This album is a big favorite in my collection of Christmas music,"Julia Lane is a master harpist! She even has the ability exhibit emotion through her playing. I received this album as a gift, a couple of years ago, and it instantly became one of my all time favorite Christmas albums. The music exhibits youthful exuberance, and the highest quality, with subtle accompaniments that compliment the wonderful Christmas melodies."
4,Good CD,Wynonna had a hit on her hands with this CD in which it seems she sang the kinda songs that she wanted to. THis CD truly seems like a Revelation as it reveals not only the many sides of Wynonna but many facets of life itslef. We see the spiritual side of Wynonna when she praises the LORD on DANCE SHOUT. Then we get it in a calmer version in MY ANGEL IS HERE: a truly breathtaking song which is just beautiful. SOme other beauties are the intro ballad TO BE LOVED BY YOU and CHANGE THE WORLD. DON'T LOOK BACK and LOVE BY GRACE are some meaningful songs which are ballads. OLD ENOUGH TO KNOW BETTER is a very wise song that Wynonna does well. The old Lynrd Skynard song FREE BIRD is done well here by Wy. A nice overall effort from one of the best singers out today.
4,It has been revealed!,"Wynonna is, to my opinion, the best country music singer, and now, lately with her ""New Day Dawning"", may be classified as the best R&B, etc., but Wynonna made an impression back in 1996 with Revelations, her 3rd installment of her solo career. Revelations starts out with a ballad, unheard of for Wynonna. The song, 'To Be Loved By You' made it to #1 on the charts and played often of the radio. Next, 'Somebody To Love You' is probably one of her best rocking songs which really ""pound the ground"". Change The World is a given to anyone who's ever heard Eric Claption's version but I thought Wy's was better produced and sung. Soft, contemplative ballads such as 'My Angel Is Here, Love By Grace and Don't Look Back really teaches lessons on love. Wy interprets these songs by the way she sings. Finally, as is Wynonna tradition, she ends the album with Dance! Shout! which leaves you feeling like your ears had just been to a party."
5,"Beautiful, Wynona...","Really beautiful CD show-casing one of the most fabulous voices of today. Her version of ""Freebird"" is better than the original, but Lynard Skynard was ""done proud""."
3,STRONG VOCALS FROM WYNONNA,"REVELATIONS spotlights the gutsy and strong vocals of Wynonna Judd. Several musical styles are explored and Ms. Judd performs with gusto and conviction. Notable tracks are the cover of Tina Arena's dynamic HEAVEN HELP MY HEART; the plaintive romanticism of TO BE LOVED BY YOU; her sultry version of Eric Clapton's CHANGE THE WORLD and the rocking cover of FREE BIRD.While Wynonna has amassed a loyal audience and fanbase, she's disappeared lately. She has a strong presence, however, and this album should please her fans."
3,totally awesome!,This Cd reminds me of some pretty wild friends and me sometimes and it is very self explainitory! have fun!
5,I think it is the best album ever done by Wynonna Judd,"I really like the song My Angel is Here, It hits really close to home with me and my baby, if it wasn't for that song, my baby's name would probably not be Angel. I really think that this album is an extreme work of art. As far as I am concerned I think that song deserved to be sung by Wynonna, she is the best."
4,great service - pictureof product a bit misleading,"I was quite impressed with the service, how quickly the order was taken up, the monitoring and the promptness of the delivery.My only problem was that the picture of the product was a bit misleading. I thought the background of the watch is white (please check the picture yourselves). The watch that I got has a silver background. There was no mention of this, in the watch description. Nevertheless, still a beautiful watch."
5,Excellent,This book has been an invaluable guide to my learning active directory programming. Very often I find that the books that I use do not provide enough sample code and the explanations for the examples are very weak. In Active Directory Programming the author provides excellent examples with very thorough descriptions. I strongly recommend it.
3,All C++ code. VB ' ers look elsewhere.,"I looked at a bunch of reviews regarding the ADSI and this book came out on top. The book appears to give a lot of good information regarding programming the ADSI, but all of the code samples are in C. It would have been nice to include code for both C and VB, afterall VB is the most popular language out there currently. I couldn't find anything that clearly stated this fact, thus I will have to waste time and money returning the book. I think that this is an important fact to make clear in the description."
5,Complete AD programming,"This is the only book I've found which deals with ldap based programming of the AD. Every other one out there deals with ADSI, which is OK, but has some limitations. This book also deals with ADSI, but only as it relates to the AD (so other interface specific stuff like for IIS isn't included). Gil does a beautiful job of explaining concepts succintly, while giving a comprehensive treatment of the subject at hand. I approached this book as a beginner, facing a large directory synchronization project, and left feeling prepared to tackle the project. The examples more than adequately met my needs, and this book will serve as a handy reference guide for the next several months at least."
3,get this for one song,"This is an okay, folky, pissed off, left wing type of music. There is nothing wrong with it.The music is pretty optmistic when, out of nowhere, you hear the duets' masterpiece. The definite highlight of the cd is ""you suck"" which is such a great, mean-spirited, kiss my @#$ type of song.It could be a theme song for so much.It could be played upon the conclusion of the current presidential administration or after your favorite sports team has a real bad game or maybe when your significant other lets you down. It has such possibilities!"
2,Big Disapointment,"People aren't really missing much. Maybe if you like small bands and the lyrics relate, maybe then. Whats with the swearing? It doesn't fit, or sound right. It seems like it's just put in there to match all the other bands out there. I suggest something different, a change from the usual attempts. Too many people buy this cd just because of the band's sexuality, and thats just not right. You shouldn't use other things to sell the music, the music should sell itself. Or else its just like every big pop band, stay for a few years and then just fade away, with no staying power. I'd rather listen to good music that sells itself, than the other stuff out there where it is sold completely on appearances."
2,Quick intro but seems shallow,"I'm a professional Windows software developer, but this was my first Palm OS book. It gave me a good, quick introduction, but seems shallow. It didn't take long to read because so much of it is code that should have been cut out and just left on the CD-ROM. Almost every chapter has a full listing of the on-going example. For instance, chapter nine, ""Categories and Find"", is 73 pages, but 41 pages are the complete code listing for the on-going example!The cover claims that you will ""Open This Book as a Novice and Finish It as a Pro"", which I think is a major overstatement. You'll definitely know more than when you started (assuming you're a novice), but I really doubt you'll be ""pro"" material.The included CodeWarrior Lite program is awful. I tried it several times and found it to be frustrating and bug ridden. I'm using gcc instead.So, while this book has gotten me started, I will be looking for something better."
1,boring boring boring,I borrowed this book from the local library and decided that it was barely worth the effort to carry it back to my car !This book has the following flaws: Poor editing. Function names change willy nilly from page to page. Boring presentation and style. REAL cheap printing and production.Shame that there arent better books on palm programming.
2,Not a C programmer? Move on...,"This book is a detailed, difficult to follow textbook that covers the software Codewarrier Lite. As it states in the beginning... if you've never written C code, buy a textbook on that language, then come back and read this book. Overall thumbs down..."
2,Difficult to Read,"I won't dwell on the inconsistencies and errors in the source code. I won't even go on about the lack of coherent references or explanations of commands and parameters. However, I must warn anyone thinking about picking up this book that they had better be prepared to do some detective work on their own to figure out the author's examples. What should be step-by-step directions that lead to a working product, are instead only partially complete. Some pretty important steps are left out, and I'd say I've had to go back over the chapters at least several times just to figure out what I (and more importantly THE AUTHOR) left out. It's easy to see the inconsistencies in the code listing versus the author's references to it later in the chapter. It's much more difficult to add in what's missing entirely, especially when I'm just learning this myself. I was hoping for much better."
2,This book had potential...,"until you read the second chapter and realize that nobody edited this book for mistakes. It is difficult to learn an OS/IDE when the author references functions by the wrong name (myEventHandler in the code example gets referenced as HelloEventHandler in the text), and doesn't give a detailed description of what the function is actually doing. In addition, sometimes he writes the line of code, then describes it, while other times he describes what the code is doing and then prints the line of code. You can never be sure which line of code went with what description. I found myself spending more time figuring out what the author was trying to say, than figuring out how the OS works."
1,Avoid this error filled book like the plague,Typos ! More Typos ! Still more Typos !Basic errors of fact .Out of date material !It is all here.Save your money.Spend it on... a better book from Amazon.com !
3,Good step-by-step guide. Outdated.,"This is a great step-by-step guide to anyone looking to develop Palm applications using CodeWarrior. Howevwer, the book is based on Palm OS v.3.1. Even though this might not seem like that big of a deal, a LOT changed between OS 3.1 and OS 3.5 making most of the code in this book uncompilable. Used in conjunction with more recent texts the advanced user will be able to translate these examples into working 3.5 code. Unless you plan on developing using Palm OS v.3.1, novice beware..."
2,Big Disappointment,"This is one of the most error filled programming book I have seen lately. The author was obviously using a different version of Code Warrior than the Code Warrior Lite included on the CD. The Publisher lists nothing on it's site about errata and it took me several days to find out that the author lists the errata on his own personal site. The book starts right at the first example with code that does not work and no explanation as to why. Perhaps the publisher should have proofread the text and tested the code before releasing this book. On the positive side, the book was a usable tutorial as soon as the errors were identified."
2,Untrue statement about Satellite Forms,"In the author's words: ""More importantly though, based on my last communication with the Puma people, Satellite Forms requires you to pay a license fee for every Palm you deploy on, which is not practical for most people or applications. Until Puma changes this I believe Satellite Forms will continue to be of marginal practicality.""This is only true in the Enterprise Edition and not for the Standard Edition of Satellite Forms. There are *NO* runtime fees for SF Standard Edition."
2,This one's got some problems...,"*Sigh*. If you've read through other reviews of this book, you'll notice that people either love it or hate it. I hate it. Please give serious consideration to these other reviews that mention typos, bad editing, and buggy code. It's all true. Granted, if you have the patience of a lamb, by all means, go ahead and buy this book...you will get something from it. But all in all, this is not a really good book for a novice."
3,Strange smell,"I ordered this after purchasing the same item at a local store. It was a bit cheaper to order on Amazon so I did. However, when it arrived it had a really strange smell, like bacon or hotdogs. The bottle I purchased from the local store did not have this smell at all. Seems like okay quality, but going back to the store to purchase, don't think I like smelling like bacon all day :-("
4,Just a few things...,"I really don't like to complain about a product from a brand that I like, but this one just has several issues, unrelated really... First, it arrived in an Amazon box saturated with oil - yep, it was from my jojoba oil. The cap was literally unscrewed a turn or two and about an inch worth of oil had leaked past the seal. A one-off event, likely... But my main issue is with the bottle delivery system itself. It has a kind of valve that requires you to squeeze the bottle hard enough to overcome the resistance of the valve so that finally a big squirt of oil shoots out into your hand. Not possible to get just a few drops from this squirt system. It makes one feel they are being forced to use it up faster than they might otherwise... I've never used jojoba oil before, so I can't comment on the product itself."
1,Buy someting else: soft ware won't install,I'd sure like to be able to provide a more indepth review of this product but I can't even install the software on my windows XP laptop. Next stop the Toro webpage to see if their download is any better than the CD that came with the unit. So far I am completely unimpressed and after reading others reviews I don't expect much.
3,Easy to setup...but software has problems with Windows Vista,"This was very easy to setup, but I could never get the software to install on my computer. The setup kept locking up. Went to Toro's website and was told that software updates were available through the update menu option. Well that would work great if I could get it to install! I have a question out to Toro on this. Until then I just have to setup the system without using the computer. That was very easy and intuitive to do."
1,Horrible Timer!,"I purchased this about 10 months ago from Home Depot. Software is unreliable, Support is NON_EXISTENT. I finally got someone on the phone after 4 of the valves failed; there was an error code that said ""fuse"". That person said ""yah, the water pressure sometimes is too much for the timer and the fuse will fail and needs to be re-programmed"" I asked ""How?"" And he said, ""Yah, we're still working on that problem. Bleh. I wish I had kept my old Orbit timer that the rain got to. At least I could manually operate that. Do not buy this! You will be sorry! I wish I had gone to Amazon and read reviews before I did. Total waste of money."
3,OK--Software needs major help,"The controller itself is solid and is a snap to install and set-up. The software and timepod are a great concept but suffer form horrible execution. By themselves, I would give them 1 star. They are supposed to be releasing new software shortly (the current software is copyrighted 2004), which will hopefully address the stability and feature issues."
1,body candy never came,I ordered this body candy Italian charm Life Begins at 40 for a surprise party for my son. Well the surprise was on me. The envelope arrived the day before the party and it was empty! I wanted to get the money back but they were closed when I called and I just gave up. DO not order this item.
4,The Andrews sisters will always be remembered.,"They were a great talent for their harmonious voices and I, for one, will never forget how great they sounded now!"
4,"Colorful, informative and inspiring!","I am a beginner mosaicist and I am interested in contemporary and unique designs ideas. That is why I was so pleased to find this book. Tracy has TONS of great pictures and ideas for using broken china, plates, marbles, gems as well as regular tiles. While there many traditional projects included, you won't find many stuffy victorian chintz designs. I found the ideas in Crazy Mosaic to be inspiring and they helped to jump start my own projects. A very experienced mosaic artist might find some of the information basic, but as a beginner I found it very useful. All of the materials and steps are presented very clearly for all projects and the author includes many helpful tips. Great pictures, colorful lay out, solid information. You can't go wrong for the price!"
3,HMMMMMMMMMMMMMM.,"I think the projects in this book were OK but could have been better, I don't know if this was a great book though, it just could have been better."
4,"WOW, absolutley brilliant","I thought that the monologues were both genuine and interesting, it captivated my audience and I could have gone on for hours, thanks."
1,this humour is not everybody's cup of tea,"taste varies, but some of the humour used here is way off line - certainly by european standards. sorry - but i was really dissapointed."
3,Heavy but classy,"Functions well, but is a little heavy for much writing.You have a similar multifunction (its maybe from 10 years ago) that is lighter and less tiring...very similar shape and size."
5,a highly recommended pair of stories,"The dynamics of bestsellers is something I will neverreally understand. I believe this pair of stories hasall the required qualities: they are an easy read, andyet there is a lot more to them than meets the eye.They both have an immediate impact, but also stay withyou for a while. I will definitely be looking for moreby Eric-Emmanuel Schmitt."
3,12 Grandes Exitos CD (USA). 1989.,"...Good Hits Edition (compilation ended 1985), Good money choice, but only accepting quality mastered.Good to get it, anyway...."
2,Shameful,"Lots of nudity, annoying characters, far-fetched and sometimes confusing plot. Don't regret missing this one."
5,Syd Barrett - legendary founder of Pink Floyd,"If you haven't heard Barrett's material, this book is a really good place to introduce yourself to the man behind Pink Floyd. If you have, this book will undoubtedly enlighten you on the origins of Pink Floyd and Syd's subsequent demise. Crazy Diamond is a thoroughly researched book which is sympathetic to Syd's material. It portrays him as a vulnerable person who couldn't cope with the pressure of having to perform, after having almost single-handedly written the Floyd's suberb debut album Piper At The Gates of Dawn. A fantastic read . . . buy this book!"
3,Okay,"This is an amusing enough read, though rambling and somewhat poorly written. We don't really gain too much of an understanding of the man or his music, but then information about both has always been scanty, and this books does its best to at least find out the truth about reported incidents of his life."
4,For All Fans,"I, like many people, and many more to come, became a Pink Floyd fan after their best work had been completed. However, I (like many others) have been so taken with the music that I had to do some research on the somewhat mythological founder and now insane recluse. This book is a definite page turner for anyone who is truly interested in Syd Barrett or Pink Floyd."
4,Good product,"This was a good deal on a full suspension mountain bike. The component group isn't top end but it seems to be of good functional quality I can't comment on the durabillity as I've only had it for a week. It bike arrived and the box was not damaged, upon opening and inspecting the bike was in perfect condition. The assembly process isn't that difficult and takes about an hour. Adjusting the drivetrain is something that is beyond most average people so I suggest the if you are not up to to the task take the assembled bike to a local shop and have them ""tune"" it for you. All in all this is a good value and a great deal for anyone wanting a true full suspension mountain bike!!"
5,pretty darn good overall,"I really like this bike.For a regular paved road or a paved trail or gravel road, it's a really nice ride. But not for hard core riders who want to ride off in dirt rocky roads. The gear shifter is excellent and the breaks, awesome! Downside only is the seat. It was comfortable at first but for after 15 min. it was painful but you can replace with the one u like. Interestingly the front wheel can be removable in seconds to store compactly if needed. The bike came with brakes that already don't need tightening and tires pre pumped with air.Putting it together was simple(about 1 hour).The packaged bike was well done too.The box came free of damage which meant the bike was kept intact during the shipping process. The estimated date for delivery was a week early than expected. So I am very happy with the whole buying process and product and might reorder again if needed in the future."
4,Great Bike for the Price,"I bought this bike for my girlfriend and it is perfect for everyday riding and she loves it. Not something I would recommend for rough trail riding or a race though. The setup was a little confusing as there were no straightforward instructions for assembling the bike out of the box. Once it was put together it only required some minor adjustments. I would recommend this bike to anyone who is looking for a low-cost solution for an all purpose, everyday riding bike."
4,well-built competition for the more expensive bike shop bikes,"I have not had a bike of my own since my college days, and wanted to ""get back in the saddle"" and exercise again. This bike was easy to put together out of the box, and I then took it to the local bike shop for them to tweak and tighten where needed to make it road worthy for my large frame. It is easy to ride and use the grip shifters, and about $200 less than a comparable bike in the bike shop!"
2,Not the same bike as descripted / on picture,"When received the bike, I noticed that it is not the same as on specification (now they changed after I called in for the errors), and not as indicated on the picture. I got the ""SRAM"" equipped instead of a ""SHIMANO"", which is a better manufacture on bike equipments and much smoother shifting gears. Some higher ends SRAM is not bad, but this one is made with cheapy hard plastics. The picture also clearly indicated this is a ""SHIMANO EQUIPPED"" bike.Amazon has very nice customer service; they sent me a new one immediately after I called, but too bad they sent the same bike. Nevertheless, I returned the bikes...... The manufacture date on this bike dated 2009, obviously this is an old discontinued bike!! You can get a much better ""Diamondback"" 2012 Lustre 2 or the 2012 LUX, which also sold here in Amazon. You won't be regret for the extra 50 - 100 bucks!!!"
2,Misleading,"This bike was a great deal -- however they don't tell you that several tools, including power tools are necessary to put it together. This cost me lots of time and stress beyond what I expected upon the bike's arrival. I had to take it to a local bike shop to assemble and tune which cost above $60 more, plus the time and trouble of transporting it there."
3,difficult to put together,This bike is very difficult to put together-no tools provided- and you'll need some specific wrenches and screwdrivers to tighten it up! We cannot comment on the ride because it is not yet put together! We plan to take it to a bike shop and pay them to put it together. Not worth getting it this way--you are better off going to a local bike shop and getting them to put it together when you buy it in person!
2,Decent,"It seems like an okay bike, and I requested it as a gift due to good reviews. Putting it together wasn't hard, though the instructions were poor. The two problems I have with it is the painfully uncomfortable seat, and when you steer it while peddling, my feet hit the front wheel. My feet aren't that big, however, I don't think they should be hitting the tire."
3,Decent for the money,"The only issues I have with this bike is that it's a small frame. I'm 5'5"" and my foot hits the front wheel when I turn. It's really for someone shorter than 5'5"".The other is that I did have a problem putting it together. Especially adjusting the breaks. I had a little help with that. It rode nice, worth the money but you have to know what size frame you need beforehand."
4,Strong Guitar Rock,"Alvin Youngblood Hart returns to the '70s guitar rock he stabbed at on his 2000 release ""Start With the Soul."" While that record was eclectic, this one is mostly filled by one bluesy, ballsy rocker after another, from the opening track through the Robin Trower-esque ""Creek Stomp,"" the Crazy-Horse meets Govt Mule groove of ""In My Time of Dying"" and the ZZ-Top inspired boogie of ""Shoot me a Grin."" To keep things interesting, Mr. Hart throws curves with Doug Sahm's ""Lawd I'm Just . . ."" and Johnny Paycheck's ""Meanest Jukebox."" In all, a very good guitar-rock record for those of us who like that sort of thing."
3,A good LOTR book but...,"While Jude Fisher's writing is even and sometimes evocative, this compilation of all three visual companions feels a bit superfluous. I mean, Lord of the Rings is great, and I'm happy to see that it hasn't been merchandised to death like the Star Wars prequels. But this isn't one of my favorite LOTR books for three reasons:1. Not enough images from Return of the King and too Fellowship heavy 2. An unsubstantial feel to the Isengard and Gondor chapters 3.Certain characters don't get wrapped up (Saruman and Denethor) But it's still a good read and a nice addition to anyone's LORD OF THE RINGS collection. Personally though, I prefer the 'ART OF' books."
2,Disappointing,"My 9-year old has the 3 previous Visual Companions, in hardbound. They were beautiful. This last one seemed like a must-have so I got it for her. Understandably, many chapters duplicated but what was disappointing were the pictures. Very poor quality - dark, mostly, and poorly chosen. When I received the book from an online source, I went to a bookstore to check if my copy was just a defective one (bleeding of colors, darkness, etc...). It wasn't. I had expected more of never-before-seen photos, but much were common. My kid has better photos of the coronation. I thought this issue would be better than all 3 put together. No wonder it's cheap."
2,"A great book, but depends on if . . .","I don't have this book, but I did LOOK at the whole thing at a bookstore. This is a really great companion, but if you have the 3 previous Lord of the Rings (FOTR, TT, and ROTK) by Jude Fisher - you shouldn't get this one! It takes all the pictures from those 3 and puts them into one book. I have the other 3 and that's why I didn't think it was that great, but if I didn't have those I'm sure I'd give this one 5-stars (the 2-stars are only to warn those of you who wouldn't want something like this). So this may actually be a good thing depending on whether you have Jude Fisher's other books or not. So if you don't have them - you should get this one for sure!"
3,Good Gel,"I ordered this gel for my son who has a mohawk. He wanted his hair to spike up. The gel dried very fast and got really hard. Unfortunately his hair didn't spike, probably because he has really curly hair. This is a really good gel though, if you want your hair to stay put."
4,Best spiking gel on the market.,For times in your life when a spike is necessary.. but a little goes a long way.. so you do not need to spike your hair when using this product.
2,Don't leave it outdoors,"I have bought this table a year ago and this summer we left it outdoors for several months. I am sorry to report that the table did not hold up well. The aluminum top is starting to lift off the particle board on one of the corners as rain water has bloated the particle board - a design flaw I believe, because the aluminum is not wrapped around the pb. The plastic corner protectors, too, are not desgined to stay on the corners easily. The net is cheaply made and the string to tighten it had torn shortly after we bought the table. The color has kept up well. I would recommend not leaving this table outdoor for long, or to cover it."
4,Great Photos!,"Not much new here in the way of text, but the book does contain plenty of excellent photographs, many of which I have not seen before. A seriously great price for such a nice publication. Taschen certainly puts out some great stuff!"
4,"Top down, wind in your hair","I have the most blissful memories attached to Dead Flowers, and it was with incredulous, utter delight that I spotted this album on Amazon. If you're down, it will pick you up. If you're up, it will inspire you to laugh, dance, or hop in the car for a ride with the wind in your hair and the CD-player blasting. Fun beats and thoughtful lyrics combine for an earful of pleasure. ..."
4,Great Price!,"I purchased this product for a family member, and they love it!! Very happy with the product!! I would recommend this product!"
3,Might be allergic,"I really need a product like this for itchy, dry ears, but I am afraid I might be allergic to some of the ingredients in it. Since I have been using it, my ears are feeling clogged and achy, and my sinuses are being adversely affected. It is too bad. I wish there were a product for itchy ears out there that did not have allergenic ingredients in it."
2,What?,"I bought this for my husband because he was reluctant to use his new hearing aids. It didn't really help his problem, so he tried a new style of earpiece which did help. The product may work well for other conditions. I'll keep it around just in case."
1,Did nothing,"My constantly itching ear may be caused by something different from most here...my dr cannot seem to figure it out--I have tried anti fungals, antibiotics and steroids..and now this stuff....I really had no effect from it at all, other than grease on my pillow...I dont wear hearing aids...I dont know what it is, but this didnt help"
5,Help Itching Ears,"Was suggested by a friend that I try this product for itchy ears while using my hearing aides, Tried and it really works."
2,Too good to be true,I was initially very happy with these. They are very big and I like the style. Unfortunately the metal on the salt shaker started to corrode and I noticed pieces of rust in my salt. I had to stop using it :(
1,Tops will not stay on,"These are nicely sized shakers and the glass is a good solid weight. However,neither of the tops will stay on. I am returning these."
2,Bad Design,"I was very pleased with the size of the shakers, but the small circle of tiny holes in the top were not big enough to get much salt or pepper out of without shaking your arm off."
2,Not very practical,"This book did not offer much advice on how to deal with the person you fell in love with. It basiclly tells you how you should pick who you should be with. It tells you based on your birth order who you are most compatible with. Which in the author opinion everyone should marry a last born. Very unrealistic. I would have liked to read something more helpful like how to approch your partner and the difference we have from an understanding of our birth order. As I was reading the book, I felt like the author was very opinionated rather then factual. I bought this book thinking it was a self help relationship book, not the case. If you are single and need instruction on how to pick and select the perfect partner then this is a good book for you."
1,No Connection Here,"I found this book to be insulting and unrealistic. Dr. Leman warns readers not to marry anyone who falls into one of the categories of his list of what he calls ""red flags"". Some of the ""red flags"" were those who have been sexually abused, those who are selfish and controlling, etc. I agree that some of the ""red flags"" that Dr. Leman notes should be considered in choosing a mate, however, it's unrealistic that any one person will not have any struggles. If you do choose to read this book, I suggest that you read it subjectively, as this is only one man's view- and it is only an opinion!"
1,This is an embarrassment to psychology!!!,"As a doctorate student currently studying birth order, I am completely embarrassed to even admit that I read the first chapter. Dr. Kevin Leman has NO published scientific studies in regards to Birth Order, (or any published studies that I could find) therefore all of his findings are simply based on his own hokey family experiences, which in no way should be a platform for anyone to advise another how to better themselves. Yes Birth Order has relevance in our love relationships, but most importantly so do the individual differences that make us human and unique, which this author(psychologist) seems to forget."
1,Extreme generalities and pop psych w/ no data to back it up,"The fact that this guy could actually write that you should never marry someone who was sexually abused, an well as his long list of vague generalizations, shows his psychological credentials and abilities are highly questionable. He never mentions that one might recover from such abuse trauma through therapy, though it is extremely well documented. I found some parts of this book useful, but most of it insulting."
1,My mistake was reading it,"Don't take a book seriously when it's written by a man who tells how he got free tickets to Disney World because he's a last born. You're better off reading something other than this ""guide."" Try getting to know someone, instead."
5,Hot,"Hmm..I have used many perfumes and have always found this to be my favorite yet. I'm not quite sure, but it is just so intoxicating. I love it!"
3,An ok read but a bit short of its promise,"The story here is a good one, and one that needs to be told. But I found Leebron's characterization a bit thin--especially in terms of setting up the protagonist for the kind of life-altering scenario around which the novel revolves. I just didn't find the set-up of Warner-as-assailant very convincing and think the author should have done more to explore the full circumstances of his desperation. The first part of the book is too rushed in this respect. Once the deed has been done, the working out of it all is quite compelling, however. It's a good read that will stay with you--the passages about Warner's mother's feelings of responsibility for his father are outstanding. But finally the book is one you can put on the shelf without having worked too hard to get through it. The theme of class anxiety in the New South deserves a more complicated treatment."
1,Oh no it isn't...,"Protagonist is a blob of jello who is wheeled around through the plot in a barrow. Pushed around by his boss, his wife, his parents, his in-laws, his kids, anyone else who wanders onstage... Not nearly interesting enough as a character to carry this novel on his shoulders. And all his reactions are far too passive and cringing to make for interesting fiction. Why other reviewers like this blob is beyond me."
2,"lifeless, who cares?","an editor should have taken a hammer--the checkovian smoking gun in this flat novel--and smashed apart the manuscript; it reads like a well-crafted exercise from an mfa writers mill grad factory. the characters, the interior dialogue of the main character, who heads a non-profit foundation in the south, and is squeezed from all side--by his wife, job, two kids--is neither likable, or unlikeable. he's inert. this is a who cares kind of book. when his relatives show up and crowd into the story, the air goes out; i enjoy contemporary fiction--jon billman, thom jones, tom paine--but i want the characters to be more than talking heads for an author's attempt to grapple with societal and personal disintegration."
3,You Won't Miss A Thing By Waiting For the TV Movie,"Had this been the novel promised on its dustjacket (that the protagonist is truly unsure of whether he did or did not attack his wife), I would have felt less cheated. Yes, it's a fast read-should make a great tv movie. But I didn't find it sufficiently psychologically compelling to make up for the shallowness of its plotting and its characterization."
2,Too Many Loose Ends,"Leebron's story of an average white-collar worker disenchanted with his pursuit of climbing the ""corporate ladder"" and ""keeping up with the Joneses"" misses the mark of being a first rate suspense-thriller. There is fast-paced excitement, but the story doesn't add up, no motive is ever revealed and too many loose ends."
2,Sour?,"trying to find similar one's i had at a recent event. These were clearly not them. liked the consistency however, call them sour is a lie. These were anything but sour"
4,19 1/2 Revelations,"Frank Fox's New Orleans novel ranks with the best of the young Louisiana writers. To anyone who has suffered through the attempts at movies and TV shows to depict the Crescent City, Fox offers welcome comprehension of the complexity and nuances of this most unusual town. To be sure, the work is not much on plot and not much on characterization, but that is what New Orleans is about and Fox does convey the strange somnambulism that characterizes much of life in New Orleans. Highly recommended to anyone interested in New Orleans fiction."
3,1973 release 3 stars,"i bought this album when i was 13, it was typical of the tracks elvis was recording and the direction his music was turning.....he was on the direction of a pop star such in the way as...tom jones, wayne newton...etc,, but occasionall would give ya a rock song to remain true toi his roots.maybe this album should have been released in quad...!"
4,RAISED TO ROCK,"THE ONLY REASON I DID NOT GIVE IT FIVE STARS IS THAT IT IS TO SHORT IN LENGTH.IT IS WORTH THE PRICE FOR""IF YOU DON'T COME BACK',ALONE.THERE ARE A COUPLE OF SLEEPERS AS WELL,""SWEET ANGELINE"",""GIRL OF MINE"",AND ""I MISS YOU"".BUT THE REST OF THE CD HAS BEEN GREATLY OVERLOOKED."
1,Never Received Never Heard Purchased An MP3 Download,"I ordered this thru amazon.com but never received the actual CD which was thru a marketplace vendor listed on amazon? To make a long story short, I ended up ordering an MP3 of the one song I really wanted on this CD, ""Sweet Angeline"" via amazon.com and no longer will I ever purchase CD's! MP3 downloads are how I shall obtain my music in the future! P.S. It was not amazon.com's fault this CD never arrived but the vendor-medimops. So.... I really can't give a true review of something I never received!"
2,Subdued performances,"All the performances on here are pretty subdued; it seems that Elvis never really cuts loose a la ""Burning Love"" or ""Promised Land"" which is disappointing. While the title track ""Raised on Rock"" is ok, it leaves you wishing they had pumped it up a notch or two. That song seemed like it was tailor made to be an Elvis rocker, but they didn't let the guitars and drums really go and as a consequence Elvis never really takes off on the song. That seems to be the case for the entire album. ""Three Corn Patches"" a country / blues type song is the only song I found really interesting. Overall, I was expecting more from this album but was disappointed.Maybe ""Raised on Rock"" should be the next Elvis remix candidate. If they would pump-up the guitars and bass on that song, it might really rock."
4,good idea,"it is hardly reroll this roll, any how its a good ideait is hardly reroll this roll, any how its a good idea"
1,"Uh, Should Be Home PC networks and old, 2005","I was hoping this book would allow me to understand the terms, uses, impacts and how to use the different options and menu items in my NETGEAR router modem.Also It is attached to a MAcintoshI read the section on starting your network-- Run your Windows XP installation--sigh10 bucks wated"
2,Networking,"It wasn't worth my time or investment.I would suggest finding a publication not as involved, one with some straight forward directions."
1,Disappointed,"Maybe some characters just shouldn't be revisited. I love Satin Doll and would recommend it to anyone, but warn them against reading the updated one. In the other book we watched the character grow and become the woman she is today, this book offered no growth development and it didn't even make for a good love triangle story. It was all just a what are they doing now thing. Boring. Joe was right when he told her she can't even be real with herself. Get Satin Doll and leave it there. I am mad I waited so long to get this book and then it was such a let down."
4,"Smooth Silky Sexy, Satin.","I really enjoyed this sequel to ""Satin Doll"" which I read a few years ago. The story picks up with Regina and all her friends, including that crazy Puddin'. This was an easy, and fun book to read. (The part with Robert and the tree had me in tears!! LOL!) Little Joe returns to Gina's life and adds more drama to all that is already going on. Gina has to see if Little Joe still has a place in her heart, or if she'd like to get back with her ex husband Charles. In the midst of all that Gina deals with her neice, who just came out of the closet, drug dealers, drug addicts and crazy people.This book is full of drama, and just when you think it can't get any crazier it does. Very good read."
4,You'll Always Be My Satin Doll,"Regina Harris is back as the sequel to Satin Doll continues with the drama known as Regina's life. A few years have passed and Regina is still the same around the way chick, only a few years older and wiser. The divorced mother of one has decided to jump back into the dating pool after a special someone from her past resurfaces. Regina must decide between the past and the present to determine her future. Also returning and adding laughs and drama are her girls Yvonne, Puddin' (how could anyone forget Puddin') and Tamika as well as her niece who is not such a little girl anymore.""Satin Nights"" started out slowly, but eventually picked up its pace making for an enjoyable read. The reminders of the events in Satin Doll were definitely helpful. Karen did it in such a way that you didn't feel like she was retelling Satin Doll all over again. It was a good balance. Karen is back! ""Satin Nights"" is an entertaining and recommended read."
2,Good but similar,This book was good and the characters were all very interesting. Puddin was just outright hilarious. The only thing is that in reading this book it sounded very familiar to me ....and that was the familiarity of Frank Lucas from American Gangster everything from Little Joe owning a night club and also being friends with Nicky Barnes to being the kingpin of Harlem. That turned me off about the book!
3,Satin Nights,"Enjoyable - so much so, that I'll have to pull Satin Doll from my shelf to read again to remember just how these characters began. The author really seemed to take the time to further develop these characters and create a follow-up story that truly engaged this reader. I really wanted to know what was going to happen with the characters, especially Regina and Little Joe. After the dismal ""I'm Telling"" and ""Using What You Got"" I wasn't sure if KEQM was worth reading again, but she gets kudos from me for this effort. My one gripe - poor editing (many typos and the misspelling of the word ""y'all"")."
4,cool,i enjoyed this new classic better than the satin doll. it really is funny and puddy is a joke in herself
4,"For Good Times, For Bad Times, That's What Friends R 4!","Ms. Miller's has made an excellent comeback with the ""Satin Nights"" of the ""Satin Dolls."" Seemingly effortless, despite many years, she captures the essence of each of the friends and keeps you as enraptured with them as they have matured in the years, although one has never changed! Good time Sally (Puddin) is still chasing the rainbow whether it be drug induced or otherwise, Regina, the main character has finally made it and when her past resurfaces, the excitement challenges her to decide if maybe she's the same or has she really changed.I love the loving camraderie between the four friends and they will have you laughing at their antics and gasping in dismay at their trials. But Ms. Miller manages to always let the genuine love and true meaning of friendship shine through from the beginning to the end!Major kudo's to you Ms. Miller! I loved it!"
3,"It's ok, but not wow","I got this for my 11 year old daughter for Christmas. While it is easy to use, it doesn't seem to warm up enough to create a ""great"" curl, unless you use very little hair in each roller. Then at that point, you don't have enough rollers to cover the bulk of your hair. So if you're dealing with longer than shoulder length hair, I'd recommend getting two of these packs or just finding another solution."
3,Remington Beach Wave rollers,"I bought this product with skepticism....I watched a video on youtube where beautiful locks were achieved with this product. I bought them hoping to get the same thing, however I was disappointed. The rollers were very heavy and didn't clasp closed well so they did not stay in my hair when rolled. After taking all the rollers out, my curls looked messy and were not great looking. I have great hair for curling and straightening, it's pretty thick and very long, and I thought these rollers would answer my quest for curls...What I do love about this product, is that the storage case is wonderful and keeps everything organized. Also, the rollers get hot enough to curl but stay cool enough as to not burn my fingers-big plus.Maybe I am doing something wrong, or need more practice, but until I can figure out how to do it well, I would not recommend this product."
1,Wish I could return,"I was very dissapointed with this product. The rollers take forever to heat up and still dont get very hot at all even leaving the curlers in my hair for 30 minutes doesnt give me the ""beach wave"" result that the product itself is named after. I would not recommend this product if you're looking for beach waves. The revlon 3 barrel waver is much better to achieve that result quickly. Even wearing my regular $2 foam rollers overnight gave a better result than this product. I dont have thin or thick hair, it's regular and curls very easily so for this product not to give the result it claims really says a lot. The product itself was overpriced for the poor quality, shipping price was ridiculous (close to $9-bought from DealYard) who also has an extremely non-flexible return policy so I will probably end up cutting my losses and keep the product rather than pay to ship it back because I was disatisfied. So overall the product was horrible and no one should purchase it."
4,not very hot,Rollers are nice and easy to use - but gets only warm. Bit of a pain to straightenn out and put back into case. Overall works
1,Remington Not All That!,Unfortunately the rollers didn't work well for my hair as an African American. This is definately not a product for people with long hair either. It may be good for shorter hair though. I will most likely use for my daughter as her hair grows or give it to someone as a gift that has shorter hair. Not too much of a financial loss since it was only $20 plus shipping.
4,Much better than your average hot roller!,I've been very pleased with these rollers - I had no idea what to expect but saw that they were on sale so figured I'd give them a whirl. They do take a long time to heat up - I usually plug them in right when I get up in the morning and then take a shower/get ready while they heat. But once they're good and hot they create fantastic curls in a fairly short amount of time. I love that you just fold them into your hair rather than fuss with metal pins like normal hot rollers - I'd always drop the pins or lose them and this completely eliminates that problem. I also feel like the soft texture is better for my hair than the hard plastic and metal pins of normal hot rollers. I haven't slept with them in yet because that seems like it would just be WAY too much curl but they are certainly comfortable enough. I find that leaving them in for around a 1/2 at least gives me a very strong curl.
3,OK job in curling,"These rollers work OK, but not great. They don't seem to get hot enough to do the job. Even after 30 minutes of heating, they don't feel really hot to the touch, and the curl doesn't stay in the hair. It does create a soft curl, but it doesn't stay. I'll stick with my curling iron."
3,Not What I Expected,"I had hoped to use these rollers for spiral curls to get a different look. They fall out, don't stay in. They work OK for traditional curls."
2,Fine hair does not work with this product,I have naturally blonde hair which is very fine. When I tried to use this product the curls came out within 20 minutes.
1,Disappointed!,"I just received and used these rollers for the 1st time and my 1st impression is that these are awful. I will give them another go and write up an update but at this point these did not work for me at all. I plan on returning them. I waited the 15 minutes before putting them in, I waited 20 minutes actually. After putting them in I waited the 15 minutes before taking them out. 1st problem was that the rollers would not stay tight in my hair. My hair is not super soft or anything, my strands of hair are thick. My hair was slipping out of the roller and I put them in tight. So when the 15 minutes was up there was no curl...at all! All that time wasted and no curl. They did not seem to get that hot. Also, they are a bit of a pain to put in and there were not enough rollers for my hair."
2,Dissapointed,"I was expecting the product to do something similar to my hair as in the product description. Instead, I got a head full of frizz from the lukewarm curlers"
1,Waste of money. Won't hold a curl. Doesn't get hot enough.,Waste of money. Won't hold a curl. Doesn't get hot enough. I tried multiple times to get this product to work. Let it sit and heat up for 20 to 30 min. and more and the results were the same. The curls fall out in about an hour. My hair curls easily but not with these things.
3,Remington beach wave rollers,"I really love the compact case and results these rollers give. The drawback, however, is that the metal rods inside the rollers tend to bend out of shape VERY soon and become useless. If this was a sturdier product, it would be amazing."
2,Not what I wanted,"I really wanted these to work for my hair...i saw a video online about them and they looked awesome! so I ordered them, but they just didn't work on my long fine hair.They might work nicely on someone with shoulder length or shorter hair."
1,Do not work!,"I am always in search of an easy way to curl my hair. I really wanted to buy another variety by conair, but it seems they don't make them anymore. Anyway, these would have been great had they stayed in my hair. Perhaps my hair was too clean? They just slipped right out. And even when I kept replacing them in my hair and kept them in until they were cool (as per the directions) the curl was not very good. I know you are thinking maybe your hair just doesn't curl. Well my hair is naturally wavy and curls extremely easily and once curled it stays. I can curl my hair with a curling iron and wear it all day and sleep on my hair and the next day the curls are still there. I really wish these worked. Luckily i could return them, but i still am short of all the shipping i paid for them."
1,Disappointed,"I have straight fine, as most may say, ""asian"" hair (please don't get offended). Because of this, it's very hard for my hair to curl, aside from using the TEDIOUS curling iron. After You Tube tutorials and reviews of different products, I finally settled on this one. Unfortunately, the product does not work well with my hair, even though tutorials on You Tube for this product share the same texture of my hair. I believe it will work for others but personally, i was disappointed."
3,Disappointed.,"I ordered these after watching a video that made them look so quick and easy to use. While they ARE very easy, they are certainly not very quick, and 16 rollers were not enough to do my whole head. (I don't have that thick of hair - pretty average.) The heating element is not very big, which means you really have to use fairly small pieces of hair to get it to work, which only adds to the amount of time/effort you have to put in to get them to turn out. Then when I took them out my hair just looked kinky more than it did curled, so I had to change the plans of wearing it mostly down for the event I was headed to. Up it went (with a sigh) and I wished I had just curled my hair after all.Disappointed in this product."
5,A wonderful Collection,"A wonderful collection of short articles and essays on the essentially American items from political biography to culture, politics and history. This wonderful study opens with short talking points by Ann Coulter and Michael Moore on the right and left in America. Most of these exerts are from talks by people describing their books they have written. Thus comments are made on people from Ben Franklin to the War in Vietnam. A wonderful collection in a beautiful binding, an essential piece for any Americana book shelf.Seth J. Frantzman"
3,Breakdown EP,"This band reminded me of the like of Aerosmith and Led Zepplin with a newer, fresh sound."
2,Terrible Boom Box!!,"The only problem with this boom box is its cd player. The first time I inserted a disc, it wasn't playing at all. It kept spinning and spinning and trying to read the cd but was unable to. I really do not know what is the fault with a brand new player but I was totally frustrated and disappointed after spending my money on it as I needed a player that was portable and yet looks good. To this day I am fortunate that everytime it reads no disc, I would open the hatch and slam it hard with the cd inside hoping it would play and it did. But sometimes it didn't so I had to do this several times and just standing there waiting for it to play and only then I could walk away from it. I would not recommend this player to anyone unless you wanna try your luck. I think the problem is that it was made in CHINA!!!"
2,confusing,the sound quality is great it is just it is too confusing to set and out on the radio. it also doesn't shut off. the remote is great!
5,Gripping,"This book gives people the chance to see how abuse changes lives. Not only in the abused but those around him. The book gives a lot of insight to the special workings of our minds and our ability to survive the unsurvivable. Each of us goes through life with a mask, unable to share the dark beginnings and Ralph Hunter had the courage to speak out on life's ugly traits. Given the dark side of the book, I truly expected it to be a difficult read, but find myself looking foward as Eddie triumphs yet again. An excellent book for those wanting to know that there is hope and life is for getting through. All of us need to know that how you get through it doesn't matter, but instead, that you get through it. My hats off to Ralph Hunter."
5,An Interesting Book,"I FOUND THIS BOOK VERY INTERESTING, REAL, AND PROFOUND. I WAS ABLE TO TELL MY YOUNGEST DAUGHTER (9 YEARS OLD) ABOUT THE BOOK, WHICH SHE ALSO ENJOYED AS I READ. SOME OF THE THINGS I WAS ABLE TO SHARE WITH HER ABOUT IT, AND WE WERE ABLE TO DISCUSS, GAVE HER SOME KNOWLEDGE ABOUT ADULTS THAT ARE NOT ALWAYS NICE. I EXPLAINED TO HER THAT NOT ALL PEOPLE CAN BE TRUSTED. WITH THE KNOWLEDGE ABOUT THIS BOOK THAT I SHARED W/HER IS THE FACT THAT SHE CAN TELL ME EVERYTHING. I ALSO SHARED W/MY 8 YEAR OLD SON. HE DID NOT UNDERSTAND EVERYTHING, BUT AGAIN HE WL KNOW WHAT IS RIGHT AND WRONG BEHAVIOR WHEN IT COMES TO ADULTS. THIS BOOK WAS WRITTEN WITH A LOT OF FEELING. YOU COULD NOT HELP BUT BECOME A PART OF WHAT WAS GOING ON. I CAN HARDLY WAIT FOR THE NEXT BOOK."
1,Keep your money and go to buy some beers!,"If you have matlabs documentation by you, you should read it carefully and avoid buying this ""book"", wich is nothing but the authors reprinting of it. What I really dont understand is what the subtitle ""for Scientists and Engineers"" is supposed to mean. If you are either a Scientist or an Engineer, so you shouldt buy this cd. If you are in highschool and are slowminded, so go for it..."
1,Dont waste your money,The tape is waterproof but does not stick to your skin. Falls off in the shower. Not worth the money.
3,Post-Rock Exhibit,"Hefty Records, a small independant label out of Chicago was the prime reason for picking this. Its catalogue (in most) caters to the more 'experimental' side of groovy things. Victor Bermon's debut is your typical post-rock offering, and then some more. With its Tortoise-meets-Eno syndrome slapped all over it, Bermon induces some great soundscapes typical of this music: lost highways, infinite spaces, mind-benders...all held together with some ethereal melodies. Listners of aformentioned artists might find have a hard time digging anything new out of this (hell, its 2008 - we've been through the post-rock excesses), yet Bermon creates lysergic sounds enough to satisfy late night loners and post-clubbing downers, equally. Its the kind of music that propels NPR's Echoes series...not really cheesy enough for the New Age tag, but neither as strong as some of the ambient works of Laswell or Eno.For a more adventurous session, I would recommend fellow label mate and producerOdori."
4,Good reel for the price.,"Awesome cheap reel. Really happy with it, drag is a little different than most reels but still a good product for the price."
3,Book Club Assignment Review,"To me the book was okay. It was very interesting pertaining to the different relationships in the book, but it was confusing. Mrs. Carter did come to our book club meeting, and I greatly appreciated her enthusiasm about her book and willingness to critique her work. Majority of the people in our book club did enjoy the book, but I was the lone ranger in having problems with the flow of the book. Maybe it was because I was the youngest book club member present, and it really wasn't my type of book that would keep my interest. I am a churchgoer, and it really amazed me how some church congregations are separated and divided because of money, jealousy, or hate. Good luck on the book and your future endeavors."
1,Yikes!,"This is really bad stuff, even for Christian rock music. Don't be fooled, this is not the REAL AFX. For that, please refer to Aphex Twin, or any of the other alias of Richard D. James, for proper guidance."
1,think about it for a second...,"Richard's got like 12 aliases. It is possible by music industry laws or something that Alter FX (shivers) was able to put AFX on the album because its simply an abbreviation. Paperwork probably lists it as Alter FX (shivers again) but abbreviations aren't punishable by law. Is that a possibility?I was pretty upset seeing afx on it, but its probably a grammatical inconsistency in rules and regulations or something. I'm more upset at the people who bashed right away and feel sorry for those who bought a cd from a christian rock group named Alter FX (throws up a little) thinking it was our boy richard.it is an outrage though."
1,Amazon should dissociate this from Richard James,"If you liked ""Come To Daddy"" or the song ""Milkman"" from from Richard D. James Album... you probably aren't going to like this. I had to find this out the hard way (i.e. I purchased this album before any reviews were posted, and there was no image).I think it is kind of funny you can buy this as a set with Hangable Auto Bulb. Maybe it would go better with windowlicker?"
1,Ugh,"For those of you who don't read, this is not the AFX who has been around since the mid-eighties, aka The Aphex Twin.It is nothing more than a feeble ""christian rock"" band, who didn't take the time to do the research to see if the alias was taken or not.Horrible, idiotic, immature, rubbish by American Christians.The only people I can see who would appreciate this sort of thing, are the ones who voted for Bush."
1,Only terrorists would by this cd.,I am convinced all proceeds from this cd go to drug dealers and terrorists.-alfred
1,Christians are just frustrating.,Christians can be so frustrating sometimes. Especially when they decide to make music.
1,this album sucks,"I'll bet your similarly stupid friends think you're cool when you slag bush on the internet. Oh, and you take cheap shots at the Christian religion by talking about priests molesting children, while all the time you probably have your own dark secrets. Perhaps those secrets are similar or even worse than the offenses to which you accuse priests. You call yourself a part of the ""intellectually capable,"" yet you said nothing that couldn't have been said by some mouth-breathing 12-year old whose friends think he's clever because he makes fun of Christians.By the way, yes, this album probably sucks.And by the way, if Amazon decides not to post this, it's hypocritical to allow people to post ""reviews"" which do nothing but slag Christianity while censoring those who would respond to them."
3,Could be better.,"I had purchased this item once before and had mixed results, then it broke. I decided to try it again since it had been over a year and I expected some product improvement. Unfortunately the concept is better than the delivery. It isn't that easy to blow up, but that is not the main problem. Rather when you try to use the pillow on the right side, the air tube hits you in the face, which is quite uncomfortable as you can imagine. Deflating the pillow also takes some time as you have to get the air out of the various pockets. I doubt I will bring the pillow on another trip abroad, it just wasn't worth the trouble."
3,Not up to Rick Steves standards,"This neck pillow is a little awkward to use and is not well padded, so tends to feel a little rough on your face. While the idea is good and works OK, I doubt I would buy this product again. Eagle Creek's pillow is more comfortable and the cover is washable."
2,Neck pillow,I found this pillow to not be comfortable on an airplane.It is lopsided and I am not able to use it.
2,upset,"My husband and I were going to Israel and thought this would be great for the long plane ride. I ordered 2 Rick Steves Deluxe Neck Pillows. We were on the plane and it was time to get them out, blow them up and sleep. Well, one of them would not hold air and kept deflating. I was so frustrated, I suppose I should have tested them out but who thinks of that, you just expect a new item to work. But it was too late to do anything about it. I think it is a good idea but the company needs to test thoroughly for leaks."
2,"great, if it would stay inflated","I've had 2 or 3 of these. The design is great. But they never last two flights before leaking, which is a real drag on an 18 hour flight. Won't buy any more."
3,"Looks weird, but it is comfortable.","I just received my pillow and decided to take it on a test spin before the trip ( 17 hour flight). Material is soft, design seems to really fit the needs of my head and neck. The big flaw is blowing it up. It is tremendously difficult to inflate. Someone with a lung condition would never be able to inflate, even before flying! It took all I had to get air in over about 10 minute time frame. Once inflated, it is a very functional pillow. I am not sure why it is so difficult to inflate....material? multiple compartments? my value is faulty? Hopefully, the product will be durable."
4,"Some problems, but...","overall, a good season.Some great team episodes, some good spotlight episodes for characters, some interesting ongoing storylines. A few episodes where heavy-handed preaching makes you look for Aesop or your local minister trying to hammer the lesson in.The loss of executive producer Jonathan Glassner and the addition of several new writers really shows, however they did seem to try (unlike later seasons).Despite a few bobbles, a solid effort."
4,Stargate SG1 Season 4,Season four is interesting but not as dramatic as some of the other seasons.... the cliffhanger at the end of the season is somewhat similar to the plot of Star trek: voyager..... they did have some interesting guest stars however....Rene Auberjonois (Star trek: Deep Space 9) makes an appearance he plays the leader of a Nazi like civilization that seeks help from the SGC to eliminate their enemies......Peter Wingfield (Highlander) has a couple of appearances as a Goa'uld who tries to pretend that he is a member of the Tok'ra.... there is a lot of tension between him and Teal'c....Very brief moments with Sean Millington (CFL player) for all the Lion fans out there.....Marina Sirtis (Star Trek: The Next Generation) plays a Russian Scientist that has gotten into trouble with their own stargate.... (that they stole).... dirty russians.....
4,Stargate is fine...,"The show is fantastic, though I found the menus on the DVD less than beautiful. I was also kind of disappointed that after buying seasons 4, 5 and 6 all at once and under the understanding that they were closed captioned, that they are in fact NOT and subtitles are NOT available. I really think that amazon should consider adding a SUBTITLES: Yes/No area to their review.However, the show itself rocked :)"
3,Monotonously Heartwarming,"I thought the episode was worth the time. I especially enjoyed Jack's recollection of a bald man in a short sleeved shirt named Homer. You see, the gang has medically induced amnesia. More than that, they believe they are workers in a dark, depressing underground power plant. The heros must escape. They do. No surprise there. Seeing Jack and Sam close together was nice. And Daniel once again proved that his skepticism is deeply ingrained. The conclusion did not involve a massive gun battle which is surprising after seeing later seasons of Stargate.If you liked this, check out Workforce from Star Trek: Voyager. It's an episode that showed about 6 months after this episode. Much more coherent and entertaining version of this plot."
4,Each season just gets better,"No disappoint here with season 4. In fact, looks like the budget was a little bigger for the special effects as many of the episodes did a great job with effects without overpowering the story line. Many of the episodes have more involvement with the Tokra. The standout episodes include ""The First Ones"", where we learn more about the Unas , the first hosts of the Goa'uld, and ""Watergate"" that features an underwater Stargate. Of course Apophis is back as the nemesis in a few episodes including a great final lead-in for Season 5."
5,worth watching,I am into episode 5 and loving every minute.It was kinda slow going at first but started to take off after ep3.I am going to order season 5 when I get through with season4but I might order it on dvd instead of instant video.I love the show.
3,Stargate SG-1 Season 4,The price was right. Purchased all 10 seasons for .25 cents a episode/$4.99 a season. The video quality looks ok on the kindle. The aspect ratio is standard TV 4:3. This reduces viewing area on the kindle screen. Good value for SG-1 Fans who are not looking for HD quality.
5,Nice deal for a set of 5 DVD's of Stargate SG-1,This is 5 DVD's with 6 1-hour episodes from one of the coolest Sc-Fi TV series ever made. Based on the original Stargate full-length movie starring Kurt Russell (he's not in this TV series). 5 DVD's for not a lot of money.
2,stargat en francais,j aimerais s avoir quand il vous sortir les stargat (sg1)en francais pour le canada. ses bien plat il sorte la premiere saison et apres il nous l aisse sur notre appetie...il sont sortie pour l europe mes les dvd ne sont pas compatible pour l amerique du nord.
4,My favorite series,"This is the season where things get interesting. SG1 has already established themselves in the galaxy, and do not require the constant aid of the Tok'Ra, nor the aid of the Asgard. It's not my favorite season, however, one cannot watch this without wondering what the histories are of the characters. All in all, I love this show!"
4,Great series season,"Good Stargate Season. Good camp humor, and is really directed toward Stargate's cult following and sci-fi fans in general. Those that like Star Trek are likely to enjoy this series. The acting is finally believable, whereas previous seasons had some issues with unconvincing acting.Amazon handled the purchase great."
5,Lucid and serious,"Nice series to watch. Lots of phantasy and sci-fi mixed together. Characters that develop as you watch the different episodes. It does require pre-knowledge, of what happenend before. The series has a certain lucidity and realism. You don't always emphatise with what you're shown. The series allows for comment and questions of your own about it. There is a certain self-reflection built in to it."
5,One of the best seasons...,"I resently bought Stargate season 4 on DVD. Season 4 is one of the best season, and the special features a great. The commentaries are funny and you learn a lot about how they make the show."
2,great show poor quality,"Everything was going fine watching last disk and last show of season 4, got to maybe last 5 minutes of season closer and thats when the excretement hit the rotary ocillator, it wouldn't play"
5,Enlightening,"I found this book to be most valuable, and I think it will enlighten people of all ages who are actively seeking God's direction for their lives.I love Dr. Sarkisian's plain-spoken style, and his step-by-step approach makes it easy to feel like you're making progress toward discovering God's purpose for your life. He's communicative without being preachy, which makes reading his book a most pleasurable experience.This book was probably targeted at young people (high school or college level), but I think it's appropriate for all ages. Speaking as a 30-something adult, I can honestly say that I learned a great deal about my purpose in life, and rediscovered God's love for me.I enthusiastically recommend this book, and suggest that it would make a wonderful gift!"
5,I've heard the first song before,"I have heard the first song ""23 Days"" on a film and can't remember where. I put it on my wish list 6 months ago and finally treated myself. and am very pleased with all the tracks on the cd. It's a brillient album, and well worth the money."
5,SHeDAISY keeps getting better!,"Fortuneteller's Melody is definite proof of how much the girls of SHeDAISY have grown musically and personally. Kristyn's songwriting keeps getting better with every album. Her co-songwriters are amazing, and her dream of writing with Sheryl Crow could not have turned out better for listeners! The entire CD is like a story, each song telling a chapter. Kelsi's vocals are strong as always, and Kassidy has some amazing vocals on this CD and really shows her strength on songs like ""Burn Down the House"" and ""Kickin' In."" They showcase their amazing harmonies on songs like ""Out of My Mind"" and ""Healing Side."" Then there are the upbeat sure-to-be-crowd-favorite ""I'm Taking the Wheel"" and ""23 Days."" Overall, this CD really shows the growth and ability these 3 ladies have. This is a must have!!*SOFC*"
5,They Brought back the Shedaisy Madness,"I don't think that I could write a review to give SHeDAISY'S ""Fortuneteller's Melody"" any kind of justice. It is by far one of the best CD's I have ever bought. Here are my ratings for each song:1. 23 Days 20 out of 202. Whatever It Takes 20 out of 203. Bring It On Back 1000 out of 10004. I'm Taking The Wheel 20 out of 205. God Bless The American Housewife (I don't like the fact that they couldn't have put another song on it) 9 out of 106. Kickin' In 20 out of 207. Healing Side 20 out of 208. What Do I Do Now 20 out of 209. In Terms Of Love 1000 out of 100010. Burn Down The House 1000 out of 100011. Out Of My Mind 1000 out of 100012. She Gets What I Deserve 20 out of 20Bring it on Back is the BEST song on the cd!"
5,Another strong effort,"SheDaisy continues very strong with their most recent album, their 4th. It continues in much the same vein as ""Sweet Right Here"" but with even more of a rock edge to it. These sisters are simply the best country/pop group out there. This is a great CD. Here's the good songs, which is most of them:23 DAysI'm Taking the Wheel - great country/rockGod Bless teh American Housewife - silly but funKickin In - another great country/rock tuneHealing Side - good emotive slower tuneWhat Do I Do NowBurn Down the House - the last of the trio of great country/rock tunesExcellent work by SheDaisy"
4,Love SHeDAISY- Great album but..,"I am a REALLY big SHeFAN and love all the girl's albums, this one is no exception but I do have one small complaint- they kinda lost some of that special SHeDAISY sound- like the girls background vocals. And the singing melody of some of the songs aren't that great, but I really do like every song on the album and they would all make great singles!!!!My absolute fav is ""God Bless The American Housewife""I am 14 and not a girl, but I still LOVE the song- as I said, my fav.My other favs are ""Kickin In"" ""Burn Down The House"" ""I'm Taking the Wheel"" and ""She Gets What I Deserve""Overall a good album, I don't think you will be that disappointed if you pick up a copy.I still say the CD is a winner!GO SHeDASIY!!!!P.S- And know i'm starting to hear that SHeDAISY sound!!!!Buy this album!! It is great work!!!!You won't regret it!!!!"
5,They're back---and better than ever!,"SHeDAISY's latest, Fortuneteller's Melody, is their best album to date. While further blurring the line between country and rock, you can definitely feel the country influence in each and every song. There's more up-tempo songs on this record, highlights including the (now-hit) single ""I'm Taking the Wheel,"" ""23 Days,"" and ""Kickin' In."" But the best song is ""She Gets What I Deserve,"" one of the best ballads the group has ever sang.Get this album - you won't regret it!SOFC"
1,Dreadful and poorly written history,"This book is truly dreadful. I was really looking forward to it, but it is just not worth buying, let alone reading. A decent history book is more than a series of seemingly unconnected ramblings taped from veterans, tied together with what appears to be sheer conjecture on the author's part.From the very first line historical errors are blatant and rampant. I'd hold this book up as a good example of why someone with no knowledge of the military should not write on the subject. You'd think the author could at least get his military terms correct. There is not one thing in this book that makes me think any of it is real. Supposed meetings between Marshall and Roosevelt what everyone else seems to have missed? You'd better document that or else it's pure made up junk. ""Reads like a novel""? Possibly because that's what it looks like to me. And oh yes, Bill Blass is mentioned on just about every other page. I'm still not sure why."
1,The ghosts of editors past...,"...are probably turning over in their graves about this one.While the book promises some fascinating reading, it quickly becomes tedious and a chore to read. There seems to be almost no structure to it, as if a collection of repetitive anecdotes were simply slapped between two covers. There is also no mention made of who edited this work, and I'm not surprised, since errors abound within its pages. Not simply typos, but entire paragraphs repeated, misspellings, missing and incorrect punctuation, the list is seemingly endless. If you're looking for a historical reference to the 23rd Headquarters Special Troops, this isn't it."
3,"Good story, not so good writing","I wanted to read this book. I really did. It sounds fascinating.I got about one-quarter of the way thru before I gave up. The writing style is difficult to read. The author jumps from incident to incident with no discernable pattern. It feels like a bunch of collected stories lumped together. It was hard to maintain a sense of progress.Reading the first chapter felt like an intro to the rest of the book. I expected some more detail, chronology, etc. While the author did present those, he presents the material in a way that made chapter two feel like an intro; chapter three felt like an intro... when is the story going to begin!?I wouldn't quite term this 'military history', but more in line of 'military non-fiction'. I'd also skip this particular version."
1,An embarrassment,"I have never written an Amazon review before, but this book is so terrible that I am compelled to post something.I simply want to add my voice to the other negative reviews of this book because the positive reviews are bogus. As the others have said, this is a rambling collection of half thought through points with much repetition and out of context quotes.I write this as I'm half way through the book (will I even finish?!) and Kneece has yet to clearly document an entire action the 23rd served in. Instead, the reader is left to piece together the larger picture from almost no hard facts except supposedly entertaining anecdotes from the very few participants Kneece interviewed. Someone has mentioned that there is no index... there is also no bibliography.Save your money - a search on the WWW would probably yield better fruit."
2,Great story. Too bad about the book...,"The story of the 23rd Headquarters Special Troops could be one of the most fascinating tales to come out of the European Theater. Unfortunately, anyone wishing a well-written, coherent history of this unit's exploits will have to wait until someone else writes one.Aside from the author's apparent lack of familiarity with World War II unit organizations and military terminilogy, especially German (""Battlegroupen""?), there are whole sections of this book that seem to be just collections of random paragraphs. There is little overall structure and a great deal of redundant text. In fact, were this not a published work, I would have assumed that what I was reading was a first draft.I find it hard to believe that a journalist of Mr. Kneece's experience could not do better than this and even harder to believe that Pelican Press was unable to provide an editor capable of working with him to produce the book that this should have been."
5,Mezmerizing!,"This DVD set is excellent! Any fan of Buddy Rich and all musicians, especially drummers, will enjoy this show. The brief interviews are interesting and entertaining and the performances are definitely the best ever amongst the Buddy Rich Memorial Concert series. The added feature of several rock tunes being performed by the BR band is great. Buy it, sit back and enjoy!"
4,amazing cookie.,"great taste, great price and great overall product. But as always fad dietsare not the way. I did go on this for a while, but Atkins only works for a short while.What really works and keep the weight off is just reducing your caloric intake and exercisingto stay fit. Simple as that."
1,Sickly sweet.,"Don't like this one and unable to eat more than one since buying it. Hate to have to throw it away, but can't bring myself to eat another one. YUCK!"
2,Too Sweet for Me!,"These shakes were too sweet for me, and tasted artificial. I generally buy Medifast, but was looking for something cheaper.And strangely enough, there were not straws attached. Was I expecting too much."
3,Feels real... but,"These have the texture of a real sandwhich cookie, which is impressive. I think these taste a bit too sweet though."
5,great substitute for oreo cookies,"I have always loved oreo cookies and hated giving them up on a low carb diet, but these atkins cookies are awesome!"
5,Lisa Jackson Slade,The McCaffertys: SladeI am a huge fan of Lisa Jackson and am thrilled to find her books for as little as 1 cent plus only $3.99 for shipping. Much cheaper than buying the books at the store and there is always a big selection.
5,His true love!,"His true love comes back...she's a lawyer who is helping his brother Matt with some legal issues.See Matt is setting up a fund his father promised his soon to be wife's mother money when shestopped working for him. Slate still has feelings for her. He broke her heart a long time ago, and he triesto explain why. She wants nothing to do,with him. They both try to deny the feelings they both have untiltragedy strikes and she fights for him."
5,Wonderful Series,Slade is the 3rd book of the McCaffertys series..you finish one and can't wait to start the other..I had to wait almost a week when I finished this to recieve the 4th book (Randi)..it was hard to get my hands on..but well worth the wait..series doesn't disappoint..
2,From Back Cover,"THE LAST McCAFFERTY BACHELOR - AND HELL-BENT ON STAYING THAT WAY: SLADEHIS PROFILE: Maverick, rabble-rouser, rebelHIS PLANS: Too busy raising hell to settle downFifteen years ago, daredevil Slade took wild child Jamie Parson's innocence--then broke her young heart. But now Jamie was back in town, a lady lawyer, all polished, feminine professionalism. And seeing her again set off a tidal wave of emotions slade thought he'd dammed up ages ago.

1,it works but smells,"the lotion ""works"" fine--moisturizes--but it doesn't really smell like roses (which is what i wanted)--has a chemical-y anti-septic smell that is unpleasant."
2,Soapy water smell,The hand cream came in large size which is good. But it has a SOAPY WATER smell instead of ROSE WATER smell!!I bought this becoz of the good reviews but was very disappointed with the smell:(
2,Too bad the director had some new ideas,"This is a very satisfying performance if one closes ones eyes. Unfortunately, the director had the glorious idea to show images of some iconic depictions of the story being told. To make it more exciting zooming in and out of the same picture and moving back and forth on it with (almost) no end, attempts to bring the viewer closer to the story being told. The few in between videos of the performers showed a much more passionate view, however, as soon you locked to it the cartoon show starts again. I am amazed that DG tolerated that and Karl Richter released the DVD that essentially ruined his and his participant's very good performance, at least on DVD."
2,"Richter is the best, but the direction is horrible!","Richter is arguably the best interpreter of Bach, but the direction of this DVD is horrible! sloppy, tiresome, and we lost a major when you buy a DVD, the interpreters in performance! I do not recommend this version!"
4,Love Them!,"These no salt rice crackers were no longer available in my area and was delighted to find them on line.No limit to what you can put on top....peanut butter, cheese, dips, etc.My bird Rockie loves them too and gets one everyday. I especially like the individually wrapped packages, so they stay fresh and crispy.....a healthy treat for the whole family to enjoy!!!"
2,cheap squeeze bottle,Mine didn't come with a cap as shown in the picture provided. And the caps don't screw on very far; they leak around the cap if you apply any kind of pressure to the bottle. I've been trying to use them with some syrupy solutions and am tired of cleaning outside of the bottles after each use.
2,"Leaky, Leaky!, Leaky!!",I bought this to keep hot sauce in since I buy Frank's and Tobasco Chipotle in bulk. I wanted a squeeze bootle with a spout and a cap so that I could keep it in the fridge.Imagine my horror when after the first use it start leaking around the part where the top screws onto the bottle. I would avoid this squeeze bottle.
3,A Web Design Program,"GOLIVE 6 MAGICPAUL VICHIERPUBLISHER: New RidersREVIEWED BY: Barbara RhoadesBOOK REVIEW: GoLive is a web-publishing program designed by Adobe. This book assumes you know what HTML coding is and how to use it to some extent. The CD that comes with the book does NOT include a trial copy of GoLive. ...Want to learn how to do a Quick Time? Check out Chapter Three and Chapter Two will explain what a ""Sniffer"" is just in case you don't know. Chapter Seven discusses collapsible DHTML menus - a very cool idea on a web site. And in information in Chapter Twelve tells you how to go about Wireless Access Protocol (WAP).Anyone new to GoLive should not begin with this book. But anyone who has some background in the program will find some extra special touches to add to their knowledge."
4,No propeller hat needed,"First, some relevant disclosures. I know three of the authors personally, and got the book for free on condition that I'd write a review and post it here. I was afraid I might have to pan the thing, but that fear went away as I went through the clearly organizated presentation of an amazing breadth of topics."
2,All Books Should Be Written This Way ... Except ...,"For me, if I wrote a book, I'd want it to have all of the production values of this book.The layout gets an ""A"".I like the chapter sections with a `binding of content' in the quotations used and the graphics employed.This is a beautifully compiled book.Three problems. Content, content, content.I also have books on bookbinding, the art of making your own books. This book will move from my technical bookshelf to my ""Arts in creative bookbinding"" shelf.This is truly a beautiful book. What I'll learn regarding the GoLive 6 application will be minimal but what I've gained on modern layout is outstanding.I'm sure the editor of this book an I are best friends."
1,Memorex dvd,"I purchased a 2x Emerson/Funai dvd/vhs player/recorder about a year ago. Soon, the purchased dvd's would not play. They were 8x dvd's. So, Funai sent me a free update for 8x. Great! The dvd's would work. But, in purchasing blank dvd's to record, I found that only Memorex 8x dvd-r would work. Not Verbatim, not Sony, nor any other Funai recommended. So, getting low on my Memorex, I searched for more. No deal. All have gone to 16x, which would not work. Then, I found a store that had some 8x Memorex dvd-r packs. Great!No! They have a dot design on top of the discs. My Memorex that would work are plain, no design. And no one who sells Memorex 8x will look at the top of their discs. Even Memorex itself does not know (or care) why the plain will work, but the dot design will not. Memorex insists that the dot design came out 6 months ago and only for 16x. Hmmmm, their dot design discs are printed 8x. You tell me!"
5,Love it but my dog is Stubborn,I love this product but you have to realize it is the dog that will use it and if yours is stubborn or has their own mind it maybe extra work to get them to use it. Once in a while Rocky will hit it and it will stick so I have to hit it myself to turn it off. It is a great product and it makes it better than hearing them whine to go out.
1,Did I get the right thing?,"I received this product and cannnot believe that it retails for $119.00. There must be some mistake. This product is a standard bag (no bigger than a ziploc freezer bag) of ""blocks"". I paid $5.77 for it on clearance and honestly would have sent it back if it would not have cost me half of that to mail it back. I have not bothered to even open it. Had planned to give it as a gift to my son for x-mas. It's not even worth being a stocking stuffer! There's nothing MEGA about it. Sooooooo disappointed."
4,Exposure of Psychology's attack on Christianity,"This is a very good book on the invasion of psychology into the church of Christ, and how it perverts the Gospel. The only negative on this book is it leaves room for the Biblical Counseling model that is fashioned after psychological counseling instead of returning to strictly Biblical methods of improvement and support within a church."
1,BIBLICAL VIEW OF SELF ESTEEM,I GOT VERY LITTLE REDEEMING VALUE FROM THIS BOOK. HE CRITISIZED JAME DOBSON AND LARRY CRAB AMONG OTHERS. I HAPPEN TO BE FOND OF THESE AUTHORS. HE CRITISIZES THE 'SELF ESTEEM MOVEMENT' WITHOUT GIVING ANYTHING HE BELIEVES TO BE THE ANSWER.MOST BOOKS I READ HAVE SOMETHING TO HELP ME GROW IN THE LORD. THIS DID NOTHING FOR ME. WHAT WAS HIS POINT? WE ARE CREATED BY GOD. GOD DOES'NT MAKE TRASH.
1,poor scholarship--polemics,misleading information packaged in an America bashing and Israel hating environment adds up to a waste of 9 bucks. This was written by someone with political agenda not an educational one
5,A must read if you are thinking of adopting!,"This book is inspirational for those thinking of adopting. The writer takes one through their experience- the ups and downs. It also reveals Gods plan in caring for children in need and the various ways inwhich one can do this. This book also shows mercy, grace and Godly love."
5,What a Joy,Michelle Gardner draws the reader beyond her words and into the hearts of the children. My daughter and son-in-law are adopting through Michelle and we know this book is authentic. It answers questions and encourages the reader to take the needed giant step into adoption.

3,OK and longwinded,"If you look for ""what NT itself can do to improve your security"" and you're not an NT expert yet, good book. It get's a bit long at times, with repeating stuff a just to make sure you got it. A bit of buzzwords compatability ... but if you have the time to read ... you'll learn a lot.For people born with NT, buy the Mc-Graw-Hill-NCSA book, a lot quicker and to the point. Neither really give you much of a 'NT bugs and flaws' insight. Go to www.ntsecurity.net (not .com) and other related sites for that ;-)."
4,MP3 player small,"I thought I was buying a larger mp3 player like a cd type and it came and it was so small that I gave it to my grandson instead, and he loves it and so does his classmates."
1,The picture on Amazon is NOT a Samsung MCD-SF75 CD player,"I wanted a portable CD player that would play CDs with MP3 formated music for a gift. I ordered this at Amazon and a different item was sent to me by Price Pros. I received a small MP3 player which is pictured andSAMSUNG MCD-SF75 Yepp Personal CD / Digital Audio Playerwhich had a model number different from MCD-SF75. I downloaded the manual on the Amazon web site and it pictures and describes the unit I wanted. I returned the item I had received from Price Pros and requested several weeks ago the Amazon change the picture, which has not been done.This is the first time I have had a wrong order from the many purchases I have made through Amazon."
3,NOT WHAT I THOUGHT IT WAS GOING TO BE,FOR THE MONEY THAT I PAID I THOUGHT THIS WAS GOING TO BE A REAL HEAVYWEIGHT TYPE OF FLEECE SWEATSHIRT. IT WAS A DISAPPOINTMENT TO GET IT AND ACTUALLY SEE THE MATERIAL IT WAS MADE OF. IT IS VERY LIGHTWEIGHT AND MORE LIKE A HEAVY GAUGE T-SHIRT. THE EMBROIDERED DESIGN ON THE FRONT IS THE ONLY BONUS. THE SIZING IS GOOD.
1,"Eh, another Maximum Biography","Sorry everyone, if this were an interview, it would be so much better, instead it sounds like a newscast where I feel there should be some reporter with an image behind her of the band. It is rather boring and I just am so uninterested in listening to it I fell asleep. It is a bunch of useless trivia that can be found on the Internet, typical Maximum."
5,lovely,"This print is beautiful. I bought it for my husband for Christmas and framed it with a gold mat and it turned out great. He loves it. We both love it. If you're a Hopper fan, I don't think you can go wrong with ""Early Sunday Morning."""
3,How could they?,I am not a bratz fan but this is crazy that they are making BABIES ride this bike!They are NOT teens!They are babies!They are treaten them like High-school kids!MGA is werid!
3,"Good pump, but doesn't work with some plastic drums","I purchased this pump for a 5 gallon pail of Red Line gear oil and I discovered that it is a little too tall for the plastic pail that my Red Line oil came in. It hits the bottom of pail before you can thread the top mount onto the spout on the pail. It comes with an adapter for taller 5 gallon pails, but it needs to be a little shorter for some 5 gallon plastic pails. I was able to use it by installing it an angle in the pail, but it really needs to be shorter. The pumping part works great and I was able to change my gear oil, but it just isn't quite correct fitting to the pail."
5,One of the best purchases...,"I planned out my purchase of the Bradley Original Smoker, investigating the pros and cons of both the digital and original units. With the reviews and the Bradley forum citing serious problems with the digital unit, I opted instead for the Bradley Original. However, I also purchased the Auber Instruments PID.My number one suggestion is that anyone buying the Bradley should opt for an extra 160 bucks and get the Auber PID. You will have an excellent combo unit far better than the digital.My only complaint is that an original smoker unit in not available as a 6 rack."
5,great smoker,"we have used this multiple times, what great flavor and easy to use. did have a problem with it after the first use but the manufacturer sent me a replacement part right away and it has been perfect since"
2,Buyers Beware,"Loved this smoker. Was just getting the hang of learning how to use it, I am the bbq female for my house. :-) I had used this a max of 13 times when on Thanksgiving morning, I opened the door and the entire door and the hinge assembly fell off. This smoker is two years old, has been garage kept and covered. So I call Bradley and talk to them. Well I can buy a new door for $54, but the plastic hinge pieces that are on the smoker itself can not be replaced. The lady at Bradley told me that I could get a new door but it won't hang or close properly or buy a new smoker. So I spent $275 on the smoker with tax and it is useless now because the door will not stay on. So now I am facing another decision, do I buy another Bradley or go with a different brand? Suggestions from anyone would be appreciated."
5,GREAT SMOKER,"I did a lot of research before making this purchase. I am extremely pleased. Smoking by nature is ""low (heat) and slow."" The auto puck loading mechanism and electric heat means you don't have to baby sit the smoker for 12 or more hours cooking a Boston butt. Bradley sells these with Digital timers. I'd only go that route if I needed one larger than 4 racks. I suggest you get this Original Bradley smoker and buy a Dual PID from Auber Instruments. This gives you precise control over the heat and duration. With the Auber, you can program the Bradly to cook based on time and/or internal meat temperature. This makes an extended smoke, like a pork butt or beef brisket, a ""set it and forget it"" operation. Get plenty of hickory and apple bisquettes. These go with almost any meats."
1,i am shocked that so many peole love this product,"we purchased this last summer. i hated it from the get go.first off, the thermometer attached to this product is off by about 15 degrees.it takes well over an hour just to get the box up to a safe cooking temperature.of course, when you open the door (to put your food in), because the box is made so cheaply with a low thermal density, you pretty much lose all the heat and wait another 45 minutes or so before it gets hot again.the worse part of all, even though it has only been used maybe 6 times, today (thanksgiving) i go outside to turn the smoker on for our turkey. wont turn on. trouble shoot everything. i recommend you DO NOT PURCHASE THIS."
4,Dont buy,i have to change my review to bad the feeding system for the pucks will not feed anymore. it quite after 5 uses. i would recomend burning your money before buying this product
4,Trouble free Smoker,"I bought this smoker after selling another brand prior to moving. I am very happy with it and love that you can load up the chute with smoke wood pucks and let this thing go for hours. Down sides include: no digital temp control, no built-in meat temp probe, and no digital temp readout of the cabinet interior (although it does have an analogue dial type temp probe stuck through the front door). Last but not least, it appears that you cannot buy any generic smoke wood pucks, but must buy the rather overpriced Bradley ones.I think you can get a model with more digital features, at a greater cost, but for the money, this unit performs well and has put out some good ribs, butt roasts and fish."
2,I am not impressed,"I bought the ""non digital"" smoker 6 month ago and the door does not close completely and it does not get hot enough and I live in Florida...I did not want to make a fuss about it, and decided to buy the digital smoker and get rid of the ""old"" smoker.I received the new smoker and the corner was smashed. The wrapping was ok, so the smoker must have been damaged from the factory.I sent it back to Amazon and a few days later, I got a new one. The new one had almost the same damage and I sent it back and received a new one. I assembled it and when I was ready to smoke, I discovered that the display was flickering and showing strange signs.I finally gave up and returned it and got my money back. Now I am stuck wit the ""old"" one that hardly works and I simply don't want to spend more time on it.And to complete the picture, I emailed Bradlye two weeks ago to complain, and they just ignore me..."
2,The Easy Bake Oven of smokers,"This smoker has a 500W heating element which is simply not enough heat. When you put in the meat, it takes at least an hour to get back up to temperature even if you have preheated the thing. If it is below 60F outside, it basically doesn't work. Look online and you will see people modifying it with additional heating elements just to get it to work properly. Also it doesn't have a thermostat to maintain a constant temperature. There is a power control, but its not a thermostat. You will also see people modifying the smoker to have a thermostat. It is very cheap and a good way to get into making smoked meat but you will quickly wish you had a better setup after a few uses."
4,Bradley Smoker,I am please with the item but expected more smoke flavor. I will try other flavored chips.Cathy
2,Bought and returned,"We opted for this smoker based on the number of good ratings (on average). What we dismissed were the numerous bad ratings and defective units reported. Our mistake. This this is poorly constructed of non-stainless and plastic, it ties you to its own wood fuel product, and has inconsistent results in heating and smoking. We had hoped the hype was true and bad rating the exception. Not so. If you want a well insulated, bullet-proof, solid stainless electric smoker get a SMOKIN-IT smoker. Ours is built like a tank, solid 316 stainless steel, double walled, on heavy castors, does not require you to buy ""their"" wood format, easy 120V plug in-and-go for both smoke and heat. You can use any wood. We're finally satisfied and this thing is all you'll ever need in a long term smoker."
2,Not a big fan!,"I am not a big fan of the Bradley Smoker due to the cost of operation and its build quality. I appreciate what it does but I think there are better long term options available out there for a little more money. Most folks I know that purchased a Bradley Smoker move on to something a bit more functional after a tear or two. This, if you Bradley lasts that long!"
1,Worked only one time,"What a letdown! The first time I used the smoker was wonderful! Ribs and tri-tip came out perfectly. After that, it never worked again! Although the smoke chamber continues to create smoke, the heating element in the cooking tower no longer functions. Looking through the many internet entries, this appears to be a common problem with this unit. But because I have waited more than 30 days to inform Amazon due to the holidays, I guess I have no recourse but to forfeit the $300 purchase price and the several boxes of Bradley fuel. Terrible disappointment!"
1,Cheap plastic,"I purchased a Bradley Original. The unit is now 16 months old. Loved it at first, then the plastic door hinge at the door base cracked and fell off, which caused the door to fall off thus precluding a proper seal. I sent Bradley an email, received no response. Out of the warranty period so no recourse. Very disappointed in this product."
1,Caught Fire! BE WARNED!,"Used my smoker for 1.5 years and this last weekend the thing caught on fire during a normal smoking session of pork shoulder. Luckily it wasn't near my house and I had a fire extinguisher nearby.Contacted Bradley to warn them of the issue. Their reply, it must have been my fault. I must have let the smoker get to hot! Really! It's supposed to have a safety cut off at 300 degrees and pork fat will not catch fire unless exposed to a flame or brought to a temperature over 400 degrees! Neither should have happened if the product worked as advertised.Be warned...this thing can be a fire hazard and when it burns your house down, Bradley will tell you that you shouldn't have been smoking meat in it."
1,Disappointing,"The Bradley smoker had been recommended by the author of a book about charcuterie, who referred a few ""wear-and-tear issues."" I received the smoker as a gift, and was anxious to begin using it. After one use, it stopped heating. When I contacted customer service via phone, I told the young lady that the smoker wouldn't get above about 150 degrees. She actually said to me: ""Sir, these units are manufactured in China, which has a much cooler climate than the U.S., which is why they don't get as hot over here."" I couldn't believe what I was hearing. They sent me a replacement temperature control unit (poorly positioned at the bottom of the machine, by the way), and things seem to be working all right. The unit has to be set at the highest level to achieve a temperature of 190 degrees. The wood pucks are convenient, but you have to use theirs, which I have to order by mail. This was my first smoker, but it won't be my last. I'll try something more sturdy and reliable."
1,Disappointed,After reviewing various smokers I bought the Bradley Smoker because it sounded like a reliable product. After using the smoker twice the smoke generator heating element has now failed and the unit doesn't produce any smoke. I'm sitting on 8 lbs of ribs with a broken unit. Would not recommend this product to anybody else.
5,Out of the Box Goodness,I'm embarrassed to say but thanks to the Bradley smoker I no longer use liquid smoke. I was able win 2nd place in an amateur rib competition because of this smoker. The smoke comes out consistently. The temperature was hard to set so you'll have to keep track of it every hour.I would have gone for the digital version if the price was a little lower. I need to fine tune some techniques but this smoker definitely does the job without a lot of mess. I've had gas and charcoal smokers before and those were even harder to control the temp.I love this smoker and glad it's part of my toolbox.
4,Heater to small,Works good! Made some delisious Smoked teriyaki chicken and baby back ribs!!The only problem is that the heat element is a little small ( 500W and it has problems to raise the temperature to the promised level while smoking.
4,"Well, I liked it, but...","I loved my Bradley smoker but tonight it burned to the ground. It was clean when I put a lovely pork butt in this morning, and it was being held at between 200 and 225 degrees for about 11 hours, and all was well, and then, everything went down hill very quickly. A small fire started around the door seal at the side, and from there, the fire spread. We ended having to empty a full fire extinguisher to put out the dramatic blaze, and all the plastic parts (and there are a lot) melted, burned, or some combination of both. It was a complete loss of the smoker and the pork butt. Until then this smoker was my pride and joy. Now, not so much."
5,Greatest smoker ever,"We bought this smoker to replace an earlier model that quit working. These are fantastic smokers. Easy to use, great flavor to whatever meat you put in. My husband made jerky from ground venison, it makes a softer version of jerky, really good. Love the ribs (!) and chicken. And the price on this one was unbelieveable. We highly recommend these Bradley smokers."
4,Great product,"Great design, and great results. Only negative is, that you have to buy bisquettes on line, no local store carries them."
2,not so great,"disappointed, if I had known: that the highest temp I could get is 246F, on a 80 degree day, and that the wind blows the door open because there is not a mechanical latch, or once you open the door to put the product in the temp drops to ambient, I would have passed this product. On the positive side I do like all the options for different wood flavors. I would say for the most part this is a cold smoker, if thats what your looking for then this product may be for you. racks seem well made and are not flimsy"
2,Lots of fun at first...but falling apart after 18 months,"I use the smoker an average of once a month, and for $399 I expected better quality. Within a few months the small plastic knob fell off from the slide control. Not a big problem. Then the puck feeder began to frequently get stuck. Recently the plastic frame of the door broke near the hinge, which I repaired but now i do not get a good seal. Finally, the heating element is putting out less heat each time I use it. The highest it will go is 150 degrees.Disappointing to say the least."
3,Auto smoker Bradley BTIS1,Not real happy with it. The auto feed button sticks in on it an dumps all the biscuts in the water bowl. The door don't seal tight an smoke comes out around the seal an around the auto feed control head. Cheapley made parts. Over all made cheap an not worth the money.Bradley BTIS1 Original Fully Automatic 4-Rack Outdoor Food Smoker
1,Poor Design,This smoker is a great concept but poorly designed. When I got it the smoke generator had to be replaced right off the bat. Then the front face plate after using it twice. Then the plastic on the door broke causing the door to come off. Soon after the heating element. I couldn't believe the run of repairs I had with this unit. When it worked it was great. Customer service was great. Now the door is broke again and it is just sitting on my patio. I will not get another one until they do something to make this smoker survive longer.
5,AWESOME INVESTMENT!!!,"I love cooking, of all types and varieties, and this adds such dimension to my abilities. It is very, very easy to use, and creates great results. We even smoked a 17 ld. turkey for Thanksgiving, and it really WOWed our guests. I especially love that you can cold smoke in it to make homemade lox and I have taught myself how to cure bacon in this smoker. Money very well spent!! This is truly a product that is worth every penney as it pays back many times over. Five stars ++++ !!"
5,Bradley Smoker,The smoker does a great job of smoking everything. It is extremely easy to use and there is no problem determining how long to keep smoke on your project. If you have a problem with the smoker Bradley technical support responds immediately and with no questions asked. I would recommend this product to anyone interested in smoking food at home.
3,It's About Time!,"Good story, scary set and some decent acting. Scared the hell out of my girl friend, a big plus in my book.The good looking cast, minor nudity and gore sure help to push the film along .I could have done with out the count down, I did not need help with that ( I don't want to give anything away here).Rent it or buy it used."
1,Eh,I dont really like to ever critisize films. Although this film wasnt very good. I bought this because I use to live directly behind waverly hills sanatorium where this was filmed and I was let down.
1,Will Totally Scare You! (If You're Scared of Quick Cuts.),"This is the basis of the movie: there is an abandoned hospital, five young people wind up there under absurd circumstances and suddenly fast cuts ensue for the next hour and a half. I'll spare you from watching this horrible film: there is a girl looking scared, then a quick cut to a ""scary"" hallway, then a cut to a picture of an ""old timey"" photo. This repeats for an entire 90 minutes."
3,Not what i expected but the history behide is good,this movie isnt what i expected from a horror genre but overall it was ok. the acting couldve been a little more better
3,A good film that's poorly made,"The Waverly Hills Sanitarium is a facinating place,known to be one of the truly haunted places in the USA with a dark history.I do own the movie Death Tunnel-it was filmed in the Waverly Hills Sanitarium itself!The story is based on fictional characters shaped into a story based on the hospitals history.Point being-the filming and directing of the movie was made by locals who are in thier infancy obviously in film-making,there are un-important snapshots of other events shown throughout the film which reminded me of the garbage I saw during HOUSE OF 1,000 CORPSES.Better directing skills and sensability would have made this a better movie."
