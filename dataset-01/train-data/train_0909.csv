5,Tintillating world of the reckless,"I became engrossed in this book, at times wanting to jump into Investment Banking, which was flovored by the 1980's tone and values that existed more prevalently during this time in American society. After this, one should explore Harvey Mackay's works. How could these four individuals: Dennis Levine, Martin Siegel, Michael Milkin, and Ivan Boesky, do so much before being held accountable? White collar crime is destructive, and destroys many lives. If the payoff is multi-millions, and the consequences are spending a short period of time in a country club, then the green light is on for greed and the ""end justifies the means"" mentality. I was able to correspond with James B. Stewart about this book and his other works."
4,Definitive,"I totally got the whole feel of the era, the industry and the crime that happened. My only complaint is its too long. Could have dropped a good 100 pages."
5,Scent and Feng Shui together for balance & wellness!,"I loved this book! As an aromatherapy practitioner, it was refreshing to see Jami Lin take the power of essential oils and combine them with her extensive knowledge of Feng Shui. I love the techniques she gives for using aromatherapy to ""code"" our world to make effective changes. This is a practical, wonderful book that I recommend to anyone who wants to incorporate Feng Shui and aromatherapy into their life."
2,I see why this book wasn't a hit,"Granted, I like Jami Lin as much as the next Feng Shui guru. However, as an aromatherapist, I was hoping this book would provide some insight. Granted it does, but it seems like she tried to push a square peg in a round hole. Some of the sections seem rushed and unfinished. I also really couldn't clearly find a way to combine the info into a complete, cohesive approach.Based upon the lack of other books on this subject, I can see where she may have struggled to compile the info because these aren't easily understood subjects. So, it might have been better to wait until a more clear cut process could be offered. Bypass this book is my recommendation."
5,Fabulous song is Marie Jose.,"This song on the album has all of the uplifting characteristics of soukous music. It has a wonderful rhythm, the very soulful talking/singing low male voice and a driving energy."
3,Left Earphone quit after 6 months,"The ones I bought look more like the Philips SHS3701/27 Earclip Headphones, but have the SBC HS430 labeling. I got these earphones for my Creative Zen Stone MP3 Player so I could have some secure earphones while working out. Like my review title says, the left earphone gave out after six months and now I use the remaining earphone to listen to music and videos on my PC while my work headset is positioned for my left ear. This presents a minor problem if I have to listen to audio that changes the balance from left to right or the audio designated for the left speaker doesn't come in at all which in turn doesn't allow the full stereo effect. I might work around this if I could change the balance on my WMP. They do serve a purpose and have lasted this long. I just might as well throw them away if the right one goes out."
2,Not bad,I owned a pair of the black ones and loved them. The one ear phone stopped working. When I ordered these they were white. These clips hurt my ears after only a short time of wearing them. The good point is they are lightweight & I used them for working out.
2,Uncomfortable,"The sound on these is pretty good, but they get very uncomfortable after only a short time. The clip is not adjustable, and it is difficult to even get them on your ear in a semi-comfortable position without fiddling with them for a minute. I highly recommend looking elsewhere for a set of headphones."
3,Meh.,"They get the job done, but they're a bit bulky for stashing in my pocket when I'm not using them."
2,ehh,managed to break these in a few weeks. need to find soethinig that can take a beatinigcomfortable though. good sound
2,bland and boring story and characters,"This is one of the most boring books I have read in the last year. The characters were whiny and annoying, especially Jerry and Sally. Ruth and Richard were a little more intriguing, but didn't particularly like them either. If I wasn't a little obsessive about finishing books, I would have ditched this one after the first few pages."
4,Good summary of Exchange 5.5,"Excellent book for learning the structure of Exchange and the most used features. You need something else for the test, however. Exchange is so ""tab"" heavy that explaining every function on every tab of every screen for every object would take volumes. I would recommend this book for a new exchange administrator."
2,Contents mixed up,"This is a pretty good book but it is very difficult to find the right information because it dos not follow the standard table of contents from Microsoft e.g. Planning, Installation etc etc. It maybe sounds like nothing but it really is a payne because you can not locate stuff in the way you read it in the main book for your Exchange exam."
3,not a great fit,"I tried the boot on and it runs a bit too big for a womans foot. Not to mention it was soo tight around the calf, leaving absolutely no room to tuck my pants in and I am an average size girl. The boot is good for very thin people with rather big feet!"
2,ran small,"cute boot but i usually wear a 9 1/2, bought these in a 10 and they were a little short. My big toe touched the tip. I gave them to a friend who usually wears a 9 and they fit her perfectly."
5,Great Play with My Background CD,"Great script for an exciting, fun play. Definitely worth performing.In 2007, I recorded a background CD for a local production of this play. I used my keyboards, drum machine and digital multi-track recorder to recreate the music in a karaoke style for their performances. It came out quite authentic. I'm MRPJZ on myspace."
2,Candy was fine...packing was the problem!,I had read other reviews and knew what to expect about the candy coming in a plain plastic bag. That was fine but the bag was then placed in a too large box with no padding and during shipment the bag busted. I had to go to the trouble of returning the candy and it was wasted when all it would have taken was for the company to place it in a smaller box or have added some padding material.
2,Gross,"Disappointed. Even though it says bulk, you'd think CANDY would be wrapped up and sealed. It comes in a messy, too large of a plastic bag in a hand tied knot, not knowing if it was scooped in or if someone's hand was all over CANDY that you're supposed to consume. The plastic bag itself came a little greasy looking and plus, the picture shows all the candies being part of what you're buying. There were no pink or hardly any blue candies which happen to be the best ones. It came in a USPS envelope, smushed, and taped poorly. I'm surprised Amazon would even allow it. There is absolutely no way I'll be using these candies for anything. It's gross."
3,Shipping container needs improvement,"We love Runts so when I found this item on here I was excited to order a bunch at one time, at a good price. The runts arrived in a standard plastic bag type package through US Mail. The outer plastic US Mail bag was almost completely distroyed, so the post office somewhere put another clear bag around it and tape the heck out of it.The runts were also in two plastic bags, within the US Mail bag and both of those bags were also torn. Being that we have no idea who or what might have touched the candy, we asked for a refund.They were prompt on responding to my request for a refund, and took care of the problem for us. Really great delivery time and such, they just need to box them up and charge for delivery.We would not have had any issues again, I might order from them again if they could assure me that they would be shipped in a safer manner."
1,False Advertising,I recieved this item and was not pleased at all...the picture shows that you recieve all of these runts...but when i got mine...they did not include the pink and blue ones which everyone knows are the best...Could be way more specific next time! NOT PLEASED AT ALL!
1,Runts Candy,"When I got the Runts in the mail, I thought I would get the Runts in the original package from the maker, but it was only a regular bag full of candy. So I was very disappointed how the candy came in the mail. I don't know if the seller had used their hand or something to scoop them candy into the bag or what."
1,NOT THE FULL QUID!,"Oh dear! I purchased this item for my daughter as part of a Christmas bundle of all sorts of other Britney ""stuff"". Imagine her disappointment when she discovered several pages had been torn out of the book. It's not the end of the world but when you're a collector these things are important. I will not be buying from this supplier again. In fairness to the producers of the book, the candid nature of the photographs and similar bylines make for a fantastic read(or so I'm told!)."
1,We are rocketing towards yesterday,"Inhabitants of a finite ""Klein bottle"" universe see repeating images of themselves, giving the illusion of infinite space."
5,Compelling,I read one to two books a year. A book has to grab me in the firstfive pages to hook me. I started Ladder of Years on the train home fromthe book store and couldn't put it down until I read it all.Now I want to read ALL of Ms. Tyler's work!
1,Shallow and Disappointing,If you are an Anne Tyler fan skip this one. I spent a week listening on CD and feel like it was a complete waste of time.
3,daydreaming reader,"Anne Tyler's book Ladder of Years kept me interested till the last page. Her character Delia is one that most readers could sympathize with, she is a normal person with everyday problems. Delia however, takes a very unordinary path to resolving them. While I couldn't relate to Delia's exact postion in life I could relate to the need to start over. I have often been tempted to start from scratch and reinvent myself in a new city. Tyler's book allowed me to experience this with Delia from the comfort of my own home."
4,A Silent Cry,"In Ladder of Years, by Ann Tyler, the main character Delia Grinstead grew up as the daughter of a doctor and sister to two older than her. Now at the age of forty and living in her late father's house, she is married to the doctor who relieved her father from practice and has three children who are quickly becoming young adults. Delia is a daughter, sister, wife, and mother, but somewhere in between being all these things she forgot how to be Delia. She lost herself so did what a lot of women contemplate doing. Sick of feeling lonely and unappreciated, Delia decides to take a walk and doesn't come back. She goes to a new town where nobody recognizes her and begins to start over. This novel is about one women's journey to find herself. I would defiantly recommend it to anyone who has ever lost themselves."
4,I couldn't put it down!,"Some reviewers here seem to miss the point. Perhaps, thanks to the kind silences of our own mothers, you need to reach middle age yourself before you can understand the urge to leave the ungrateful husband and kids behind. It is only a fantasy to most of us, obviously an unspoken fantasy. But as Cathie Pelletier wrote (in The Bubble Reputation), ""You show me a woman who never dreamed of getting in the car, heading off and leaving the whole family behind and I'll show you a woman who doesn't know how to drive.""The book was very entertaining, and allowed sympathy for all of the characters. If you think it is unrealistic wait until you reach Delia's point in life."
1,Ladder of Years,"To me is was a book that went nowhere! Depressing, unusual and not interesting to me. I read it as a book club pick. Yes, I read it to the end.Doubt if I will read anything else by this author. If there are real people like the main character, I don't know any. I am thankful."
4,The Perils of Life,"Who hasn't at sometime in their lives wanted to just walk out of their existing life, leaving everything and everyone behind and starting over. That is exactly what Tyler's primary character, Delia Grinstead did. Losing herself to the needs of her family, Delis sets out on a journey to discover her inner self.Tyler has written an entertaining, thought provoking story centered around the rites of passage of a middle-aged wife and mother. An excellent read."
1,Disappointing ending--why did I read this?,"Yes, it held my interest, and was fairly enjoyable to read, as I went along. But this book is the epitome of unsatisfying. The ending left me feeling cheated."
3,Book Club - Contemporary,"In this story Delia walks away from her husband and three children while on a family vacation at the beach. The whole premise of the book was hard for me to get past. It made the character difficult to like. Anne Tyler is a gifted author (also wrote The Accidental Tourist) and had an easy writing style. However, the story's concept was lost with me. I also was not thrilled with the ending. There is a lot that would make this book enjoyable as a book club selection. Many of the reviews reflected differing viewpoints."
3,A study of people rather than a thumping good story,"It is indisputable that Anne Tyler writes well. She has studied people and conveys their idiosyncrasies flawlessly which makes this story so real - the actions, the speech, the thought processes. It is subtle, yet deep, light-hearted, yet still portraying such unspoken human emotion. You find yourself asking what has happened after all those pages have been turned. It has been a journey, metaphorical and physical, yet it can, in some ways, be summed up in a sentence or two. It is not a 'gripping page-turner', so why does the reader continue? Resolution."
4,Good from beginning to end,"Anne Tyler writes a very compelling story about a women (Delia Grinstead)who one day up and leaves her husband and three children. She feels she needs to find her own destiny and see if she is able to make her own choices and own decisions in life. She also wants to see if her family that never seemed to care will really care if shes gone. A part of me felt for Delia, because her family treated her like crap and she needed to just get away (it took guts), but at the same time a part of me was saying how could you leave your children like that. I loved this story from beginning to end and I couldn't put it down myself. However, I need an ending and this just leaves you hanging...okay whats going to happen next? We don't know and I need to find out, I wanted to throw the book across the room when it left me there with nothing."
4,Reader Response,"I thought that this book was well written and kept me engaged every step of the way. I could relate to Delia's choice of finding a new life, although I don't think that I could ever up and leave myself. At the conclusion of the book, I still had many questions left unanswered. I wish that it could have gone on a few more chapters so I could cure my craving to find out more."
3,Hasn't this been done?,"This is the first book that I have read by Anne Tyler, so I can not say about her overall abilities, but this novel seemed to lack something. I found it somewhat predictable, a normal Sunday afternoon on Lifetime. Granted, the story had a very good flow and was very easy to read, and there was good character development, but none the less it lacked that sparkle that keeps you guessing and wanting to read. I often found myself wondering about Delia's feelings, and how easily she was able to block other's feelings out. It just all seemed too easy. In a book about hardships and feelings many women have, I would think the novel a bit easier to relate and connect to. I would recommend this book for some easy reading on vacaton, maybe while taking a long flight, but not to ponder while sitting in a garden."
3,Ladder of Years,"I enjoyed this book for may reasons such as it charcters, its story line and the stages the book goes through with Delia. While reading this book I loved the fact that I felt I was right there with her(and also at times I was her) as she traveled through her road in life. I'm not sure quite if I feel one way or another about Delia leaving her family but I know she needed to do that for herself. I enjoyed watching her do something very few people would do but at the same time I thought what wes the reason she did what she did. I know I feel she left because of her family but there may be something else we never knew. But the only thing we know is what we each get out of it."
2,Delia still needs to get a life!!!!,"Just finished this book and I just remembered why I usually don't read fiction. Delia, honey, everyone feels overlooked and unappreciated from time to time. Walk out for 18 months and then come back like nothing ever happened; ooooooooohh that'll show'em! Except for having the moxie to walk off the beach, Delia was about as interesting as paste. If Anne Tyler's objective was to get me to the end of the book she did the job. I kept reading hoping and praying Delia would ""find herself"" somehow. As an avid reader I don't require a neatly, summed up happy ending to any book; I just require an ending worth reading. Did not happen for me in ""Ladder of Years"""
2,Delia's great adventure certainly doesn't teach her much.,"Delia leaves for almost a year and walks right back into the same crap. She is totally inconsiderate and mindless in her leaving of two families; first her husband and spoiled children, and secondly Joel and Noah who come to love and attach to her. I've read many of Anne Tyler's books and I'm starting to wonder why. Her female characters are always confused and weak. Somehow, I expect better of female characters. The only lesson Delia ultimately learned was how to become a better ""doormat""."
4,A Wonderful Book/Great Read,"Boy, did this book generate a lot of discussion in my book club! I thought it was wonderfully humorous, like all of Ann Tyler's books, but absolutely sad at the same time. I think Delia just got fed up with being ignored and had sort of a minor breakdown. What mother hasn't fantasized about going off and teaching them all a lesson?! I think that at the end she did go back to them and that things would absolutely be different. I also loved her children and felt very sad for the father and son she had been caring for, but she belonged with her own family. She had helped them over a rough period in their lives and even though they had come to depend on her, they are going to be fine. I enjoyed this book so much!"
1,One of the WORST books I've ever read,"I really liked the premise of this book. Underappreciated housewife walks away from it all. But, it went no where from there. Delia, the wife and mother who walks away, was as hollow and unbelievable as any character I've ever read. Tyler failed to explore emotions of relief, guilt, doubt or any other feeling one might have in that situation. This 300+ page novel does nothing more than amble along a sleepy town where Delia goes about her new daily life without so much as a touch of introspection. The ending was terrible. I put down this book hating Delia, her family and quite frankly the author. This is my first Tyler book and would be my last but I already purchased A Patchwork Planet. That book couldn't be any worse."
2,Not worth your time,"Another mid-life crisis goes wrong book. The plot is implausible, most of the characters are not fully developed, and you finish the book wishing for a better ending."
3,"Anne Tyler is a good writer, but . . .","I have enjoyed some of Anne Tyler's books, but I did not enjoy this one. I understood why Delia had the desire to do what she did, but in doing it I lost all compassion for her. Basically, she deserted her family, then put herself in the position where she would have to desert another family to go back to her own. I like her writing style, but not this character."
3,Rality of Life,"The book by Anne Tyler, Ladder of Years, deals with several deferent things. It is mainly focused on Delia, the main character in the book, and struggles somewhat with reality. She cannot deal with her children growing up into adulthood, her husband not given much attention to her, and her father's death. When she felt that she was not needed she left her life, family, everything that society considers being important. In my opinion everything was up to her to decide what to do with her life. I would say that first half of the book was much more interesting than the second part, because even in the new city she turns towards her old style of life. The book shows some negative aspect of family life and ruins the perfect family picture that is presented in our society, which I think that author wanted to point out. Over all a book was worth of reading because every book brings something new to a reader."
2,Banal at best,"While the book was an easy read, I found Delia hard to like. Her character throughout the entire book was very self-absorbed. When her son came to visit her, she didn't act thrilled, she acted like it was just another day with him, and carrying on with life as usual.When she was with her husband she was the doormat wife, but she swung too far in the other direction when she left, not caring a smidgeon for the ones she left behind.When she returned for her daughter's wedding, she just walked in and took her place and life carried on as if she had not spent the last 18 months of her life away from her marriage and children. She just went ahead and made her family's favorite dishes.The ending just seemed thrown together, and left it vague which life she returned to."
1,Wimpy Character,"At first I thought that I liked this book, but by the end I disliked the main character very much. SPOILER ALERT...She wimped out on her family and then wimped out on the next family she created for herself. How could you trust a person like this? I felt so sorry for the little boy she had been taking care of. Nasty nasty woman."
4,Delia inspired me to want to walk away.,"Delia Grinstead still has not found herself at forty, so in an effort to start from scratch,she leaves her husband and children without a word during a family vacation. She then, unknowingly, relocates and before she knows it her identity is Miss Grinstead in a small town called Bay Borough. The beginnging of the novel was very intriguing when she starts feeling invisible and meets Adrian Bly-Brice. As the novel progresses it seems to repeat itself, especially when she becomes a nanny to a man and his young boy. The ending also disheartened me because I had the feeling Delia was being thrown back to the life she had grown to hate. All in all a very well written novel that held my attention through the entire experience. I felt like I was Delia, I laughed and cried with her."
4,A great book with a few errors,I am 16 years old and I have just finished reading the Ladder of Years and everyone's reviews. I was shocked that so many people were okay with the ending of that book. I thought that the book was great but the ending left me with an angry feeling as to why Delia would do what she did. It made me dislike her character and realize that all she will ever be is a doormat for her unappreciative family. She could have been happy with Joel and Noah who loved and would have treated her great as they did when she lived there. I was dissapointed in her character but thought that the rest of the book was great. Thankyou. Jules
4,"Typical style of Tyler, slow, methodical, slice-of-life","Anne tends to take a long time to make any points in her novelsand this is no exception. I did like the ending but thoughtthat Sam should have been developed more as a characterthrough our eyes instead of Delia's. Some of the charactersseem to be unnecessary (i.e. Vanessa).Still, I enjoyed reading it. Will, probably , continuereading any new books she comes out with."
2,Plodding all the way...,"I am, I confess, only a third through this book and thinking I will put it down. Now remind me: why did this author win the Pulitzer? I've read five of her books, and liked Patchwork Planet best, but even that, sweet as it was...well, I do not think that Ann Tyler writes ""beautifully."" She writes ploddingly. Yes, her writing leads you on. You keep hoping the next sentences will actually lead to something important in the plot or character development. Ho-hum. They don't.In reference to this book: what is the point of going from the archetype of MOM and WIFE to SECRETARY? Now, if I were writing this book I would have plunged Delia back into another life...made it more ""Twilight Zone""-like. That would have added at least a soupcon of spice...as it is, ""Ladder"" is flat, unsalted, dietetic, in short, not tasty. All those who enjoy a taste-less book, raise your hands. Deafening silence."
2,Disappointing,"I got to the end of this book wondering why I had got there. It can't have been totally terrible or I would have given up before the end, but it left me with nothing much. The story is about a woman (who happens to be a wife and mother) who on impulse walks away from her life for a year or so and does something else. A ""finding oneself"" story? Maybe. A story of establishing that the grass is not really greener anywhere else? Maybe. It is slightly dull, probably by design, and I think one reason I kept reading was because there had to be more, right?.... So the denouement (a damp squib), coupled with a number of loose threads left untied, made me feel the whole experience was an unsatisfying one. Shame. ""The Accidental Tourist"" was an excellent book, however."
3,Many topics,"This book Ladder of Years is interesting. In some ways I did not like it, but in others I did. I agree with one other reviewer that said this book has many topics. Some of Anne Tyler's topics include relationships, self identity, middle age crisis. Anne Tyler did a good job of providing a novel that has many different ways you can interpret it and when a reviewer looks at others views, they can take that view and say, ""Oh yes, she did say that didn't she."" This book was pretty easy reading."
4,Be careful where your walk takes you,"This book had a great plot idea. The mother is overwhelmed by it all. She just leaves while the rest of the family is on vacation....starts to walk and never looks back. There are some great characters in the book. The main character, Delia, is hollow feeling to me though. I feel for her and there are times when I really relate, and other times where I could almost put the book down--but am too curious about the ending to do that. A very interesting read, but I felt let down by the ending. If you enjoy Anne Tyler though and her odd characters as I do, then it's worth the read though."
2,choices,"I believe this novel is expressive of the feelings many people go through, both male and female. It is the choices that we make each day that can enhance or tear apart our family bonds. This book has made me realize the value of commitment, work, and communication in ""real-world"" relationships. Walking away will not fix your problems, only prolong them. The love and support of family is one that no other relationship can overcome...Blood is thicker than water, and yet Delia still choose to leave. I hope that other readers are able to see the consequences of leaving children and a family that depend on you on more than a physical presence, but a emotional presence as well (even when emotions and appreciation are not expressed as you would like them to be). The effects the children will endure will last a lifetime for that short time Delia took for herself. The end of the novel seemed as though she was able to just ""climb"" back into her old lifestyle; it's just not that easy!"
4,A story about real life,"Ann Tyler Ladder of Years was an interesting novel to read. It was my first time reading some of her work and I was intrigued with her process of pulling the reader in. Many readers view Ladder of Years as a fairy tale, but I somewhat disagree. Delia represent many women who have devoted a majority of their lives to their families. Delia woke up one day and realized her family didn't need her anymore. she was forty years old without any self identity. She started wondering who she was and what to do with the rest of her life. In order to gather her thoughts and emotions, she left her family. While she was away from her family, she ran into many experiences that reflected who she was as an individual. She returned to her family a changed woman able to deal with life, relationships, and emtional ties to family members."
2,"Strong intentions, but weak in the end...","I must admit I was definately disappointed with this book. My initial reaction was thinking that the book would be exciting and that she would be a strong woman, but I feel as though I was let down by the ending. The first page gives a missing woman discription which sparked my interest right away, but then as I read on there was no real missing woman at all. In fact she up and leaves everything to start a new life for herself. That idea sounded good until I realized she was still unhappy and falling back into a lot of the same patterns that she was so unhappy in at home. I really expected more out of this book. I read this for a class so I am not sure now what to think about Anne Tyler. I am debating trying to read another one of her books, hoping for a strong female character, and some action."
2,Waste of time,"Sorry, but I found this book a total waste of time. I never did like the main character - I found HER boring! I laughed out loud when I read another reviewer say that ""this person escaped her life to be a secretary?"" - good point! It was just so unbelievable a woman would leave her children without any thought really - and to continue this ""new"" life without really taking time to search her soul. Instead she befriends even more boring people than herself.As far as the ending of the book goes - I couldn't have cared less what happened to her anyway! After reading it (book on tape) I felt I had totally wasted my time. What a disappointment."
1,What Happened to Anne Tyler?,"What happened to the Anne Tyler I knew and loved? Is this the same brilliant woman who wrote Breathing Lessons, Homesick Restaurant, and St. Maybe? I found the story contrived and awkward. Unlike her other works, it was far from compelling. I kept reading, hoping the narrative would get better, but it didn't. Alas. If you've never read an Anne Tyler book before, don't make this your first. It's not representative."
1,Ladder of Years,"I had the opportunity to read the book Ladder of Years. In the beginning of the book I was excited and drawn to the book, but as the book progressed I became mad and frustrated. I felt the book led up to an ending that wouldn't come. I was very disapointed in the book. I found the book to be a let down!"
2,Ladder of Years - Review,"Ladder of Years focuses on the liberty progression of a sheltered wife and mother, Delia who ultimately ventures into a new world. Initially, I was intrigued by the character of Delia as she appeared to be a risk taker. She was willing to act as a stranger's wife and venture into a new world. However, this only appears to be an illusion considering that she is really only trying to be this type of person - it is all a facade! Her relationships with her family are primary examples of how she continues to keep her true self-bottled up inside. She never conveys her true feelings to anyone EVER!!! For instance, she mentions to her son after coming home from the shopping mall, ""The funniest thing, Caroll"", Her son continues to ignore her and she does nothing to defend herself. This indefensible behavior never ceases to exist. She settles for complancency, choosing not to change from her existing state! I guess she got stuck on the lower half of the ladder."
2,Not Anne Tyler's best,"I usually really like Anne Tyler (and I do like her consistency in telling stories about characters that are real, but not necessarily likeable) but this was my least favorite book I've read by her. I could understand how the main character felt marginalized in her life, and to some extent how she could make the decisions she made, but she just seemed to lack depth. In a story that was mostly about stepping out of her life and creating a new one, this character seemed to shrink and lose depth when it seemed she should be growing. To me the main character was difficult to identify with, and I found her choices often disappointing. I've found Anne Tyler's other novels to have odd characters that were often nothing like me, but I could still identify with them on some level. There are many other Anne Tyler books that should be read before (or instead of) reading this one."
2,"Flat characters, implausible plot","It just occurred to me that maybe Delia's family didn't care that she left because they didn't notice. She's such a flat, boring, predictable character. Even so, I was surprised that her family was just kind of like, ""meh, whatever.""The book jumped too all over the place and was too random for me. Adrian's mother-in-law breaking into their house during supper? The grandfather and his new wife... Binky. Becoming friends with Noah's mother. The romance of Mr. Lamb and Belle. The straw that broke the camel's back for me was the scene with her daughter's fiancé (with her daughter breaking off the wedding because her fiancé was mean to some random kid on the phone? And hunting down the kid and the girl he likes?? What?!?).I wanted to finish the book to see what happened, but nothing really did happen. Does she stay with Sam after all? Move back to Joel? Have a torrid affair with Adrian?"
4,Leaving home,"Have you ever had the fantasy of walking away from your life? This story explores what happens when that fantasy is followed. Like other Anne Tyler novels, I felt the central character exists in a grey fog, unaware of self and lacking the ability to take control. The first 1/4 of this book was spent delving into a potential affair, and seemed too drawn out. The conclusion was also unsatisfying, since the main character returned to her life without sharing with her family why she had left them for another life. A good read, but one that left me cold and sad."
4,Underlying Tones,"There are so many underlying tones of this book. It is a great one for book clubs and book discussions, because there are so many things that one could talk about. The symbols used throughout the book really get one thinking and it places you in the life of Delia and it has you questioning what you would do in her situation. It is written with a brillance that takes you from behind and does not let you go. I would recommend it highly, especially if you have someone to discuss it with."
3,A roller coaster ride,"Ladder of Years was the first book I read by Ann Tyler. Needless to say, the book was like being on a roller coaster ride with my emotions. I absolutely loved Delia for making a stand and having the courage to leave everything behind. Although at first, I thought she was very irresponsible for leaving her family like she did. Yet, the first page confirms all her reasons to leave, no one really knew her. Delia felt like she was being used, abused and living in the shadows of her husband and father. I believe Delia did what some of us would only fantasize about doing. Since most of us would be afraid of what other people would think. I applauded ""Miss"" Grinstead's new life, she was finally doing what she wanted, when she wanted. I cheered for her all the way until the end. However, I was very disappointed with the ending of this book. After she had come so far in her new life, to have Delia fall back into her old ""habits"" was a devastating blow to an otherwise fairy tale story."
4,It's a tragedy,"I didn't like this book as much as I liked her previous work, but I still liked it. Anne Tyler has the gift for using the most perfect words to describe everything. Even the names of her characters tell you something. I think the end was perfect because her family didn't even know what she went through during her time away..so how could they have possibly appreciated her any more? Their lives went on just as her's did...and her absence became more of an annoyance to them. To me, Ladder of Years was more of a tragedy on the more literal side, but a triumph for Delia who discovered so much about herself. Lastly, who could forget the whole ""Playing Baseball in the Fog"" part, where they presevered with the traditional Bay Borough baseball game despite the weather? I was starting to believe that all the lost souls end up at Bay Borough. :) Grab this book, it's worth the time."
3,"Well-written, escapism.","Anyone who has ever been tempted to run away will applaud the imagery in this book , for it captures that sense of longing and despair to perfection. It is the story of a middle age woman who runs away from her day to day boredom in order to find herself. Overall it is not a great book but Ann Tyler writing style is incredible. There are lines that take your breath away, merely from impact of the truth that is being conveyed. The flaw is the avoidance of the emotional turmoil that such an act demands. The result is a fairy tale ending that is an insult to the reader and the writer."
4,"BUT AFTER ALL THAT, she went back!!????","Anne Tyler is one of my new ""best authors"". I loved her writing style immensely. I cried when the main character cried, etc. but the book left me a little distressed, because she just walked right back in and it seemed as each person treated her exactly the same. I wanted to reach right in and pluck her from that house and put her back in her ""new"" life. Anne portrayed her as a strong woman and able to take care of herself but then after all that, she went back..... GO FIGURE!!"
2,emotionally unsatisfying and carelessly conceived,"Anne Tyler's Ladder of Years is a totally disappointing reading experience. The concept of a unfulfilled wife and mother deserting her grown family has promise- but Tyler's carelessly written novel finally leaves her readers unfulfilled. The book hurtles toward a totally unsatisfactory ending with the heroine Delia Grinstead reassuming her ""rightful"" position in the midst of her family with seamless integration. There is virtually no discussion of her departure nor any attempt to deal with the issues which caused her to behave so uncoventionally. If the characters in books were to have afterlives, one can imagine that Delia's life would remain unchanged, while the people whom she encountered and befriended during her hiatus would feel used and abandoned. One wonders if Tyler's publishers made her edit out all of the passages that gave the plot lines conclusions and the issues resolution"
3,Money Talk Soundtrack,"This is the era of must have soundtracks the 90's. This soundtrack doesn't compare to the hard hitting ones that was being released around the times. It's still survives due to the r&b tracks that's composed for the movie ie,(Barry White & Faith also the Mary J track)"
1,They never sent this to me I paid for it????????,I still have not received this item as of this date. Amazon charged me for and Nothing. I contacted the supplier and he said he would resend it and Nothing.......
5,must buy,this is one of the best albums i have heard. it has a nice variety of songs. tracks to dance to and slow songs too.
4,bertrand russell is more accessable...,"Frankly, I'm more impressed with Bertrand Russell's _Why I am not a Christian_ than with this book...Shelley's writing is couched in such period rhetoric (early 19th century / late 18th century style) as to be rather clumsy and turgid for the modern reader, and the assumtions and argumentation rely on premises that are often faulty or no longer seem valid in the contemporary world.All that having been said, the short essay ""On Life"" was most impressive indeed and in many ways seems a foreshadowing of Postmodernism. Very startling to see that Urquelle in a text like this.This book looks great on a bookshelf, but is a little dissapointing in the actual reading of it, save for ""On Life"". The title essay is especially disappointing. Oh well..."
5,Shelley's thoughts on Life and God,"This book is an excellent introduction to Shelley's existencial thought, containing some impressing essays such as ""The necessity of atheism"" and ""On Life"". It also helps the reader to understand the marvellous personal ""animus"" that hiddened beneath Shelley's great poems."
4,It's what I expected,"I'm going for a dinghy cruise on the Albamarle Sound. From the tiller the Ritchie Explorer is a tad hard to read with old eyes and it's very plastic and light feeling. However for the price it seems like a good value, fits the centerboard trunk nicely and looks good. Returns to heading reasonably fast. 4 days in a 14' sailboat next month should give it a proper field test."

1,One thing,I just have one thing to say to Burt Ward on my behalf and on behalf of anyone he's ever come in personal contact with:Zip it.
4,Dynamic Duo Exposed!,Jaw-dropping details of what went on behind the scenes during the making of the 1960's Batman TV show. Great fun! Those swinging 60s.[...]
4,Hilarious Look at Burt Ward's Life in tights,"When I first ran across snippets about Ward's sexual exploits, I took them with a grain of salt (okay, a POUND of salt). After reading the book, I don't doubt any of the stories because of the honesty you can see throughout the tome. Ward tells a convincing story of what it was really like to work on a '60's hit TV series. The book goes a long way in explaining why Adam West still doesn't want to relinquish the Batman hood (if you had as many groupies as he did, you wouldn't either). Anyway, it's a funny book and after reading it you'll never watch Batman in the same way again."
1,Vanity press,"In Ward's book, he claims to have had a relationship with a blonde actress who was making a show the same time he was on the Fox lot. Doesn't take Sherlock holmes to deduce that he's talking about Marta kristen from LOST IN SPACE. He claims she flipped out when he dumped her.Well, I met her co-star and friend Mark Goddard a few years ago, and, with some prodding, he flatly stated that Marta never dated Ward and that his opinion of the 'Boy Wonder' was low indeed.Ward also claims to have viewed a screen test of Lyle Waggoner audioning for BATMAN, and that Ward recognized LW from the Carol Burnett show. Only problem there is that Lyle had yet to join Korman, Burnett et al. at the time BATMAN was in preproduction."
5,My Life In Tights--A Must-Read,"This book appears to be a totally honest and unabashed account of the filming of the Batman series and the life of Burt Ward. I listened to an audio interview of Burt Ward on a website, in which he discussed this book. It piqued my interest enough to order ""Boy Wonder."" I thoroughly enjoyed anecdote after anecdote of his life. Personally, I read the book for the three reasons: 1) for what went on in producing Batman 2) to find out what happened to the Boy Wonder after 1968 & 3) to read of the detailed BatSexcapades. I was not disappointed. I highly recommend this book if you're a fan of Burt Ward, assuming you won't be offended by his graphic recounts of his sexual triumphs. I'm only sorry that it took me seven years to read this book after it was originally published."
1,Avoid at all costs,"A shallow, self-promoting work. While Adam West discussed his Batman role with dignity in ""Back to the Batcave,"" it is a shame that Burt Ward did not do the same. Instead, he chose to harp on his putative accomplishments and sexual exploits, which left a foul taste in this reader's mouth."
3,Be afraid. Be very afraid...,"Well, let's see... to begin with, it's not a non-fiction masterpiece. I'm giving it three stars just for Burt's gutsy approach. You know, I loved Batman - the original series with Adam West and Burt Ward from watching the show religiously as a child - this was amazing, campy brain candy. Great guests, funny (yet crazy) plots, all of that Holy Batman dialogue and animated ""POW"" and ""WAM"" nonsense. As much as I have grown to love anything retro - the cheesier the better, in fact - I did feel a bit dirty after reading this. Who knew these sexcapades were going on? My memories feel a bit soiled as well. But I did snicker a few times (along with some grimacing). Now about that cover... I don't even know where to begin. BURT! WHY? WHY? WHY WOULD'YA DO IT TO US???? Sigh. I'd better stop here. Though it is a must read for any real retro-Batman fan. Just be prepared... Be very prepared..."
1,Holy Piece of ... Batman!,"This is, without a doubt, the worst book that I have ever read.The one conclusion that I drew from the book was that, in real life, Robin is a ... loser. I would have thought that he had an interesting life. I was wrong. What is so sad is that he puffs up himself all through the book, but then he slams almost every person that he ever knew. I think the only exception to that is he speaks well of his kids and his current wife. Of course, he ought to speak well of her because she is his sugar daddy - without her money he would be a poor man, as he has no talent, no scruples and no life.Please, don't read this book. You will thank me for it.Robin, good luck, hope that you find a life someday."
3,Good cheap lamp,I was looking for an inexpensive clamp light and this is it. I like the way the clamp allows you to put it just about anywhere. I gave it 3 stars because it was packaged for shipping pretty poorly and it arrived a little dented but I kept it because it is used where only I see it. the price was right and it serves it's purpose.
5,Great to keep kiddos occupied,We love the Thomas and friends collection - Such a great kid's show! Our 3 year old would watch these movies 24 hours a day if we'd let him.
5,Fantastic,"I found this CD completely by chance and I'm so glad I did.A fantastic collection of some of his best remixes, not to mention great original tracks.For all the people out there who say trance is boring and all the same, I suggest you check this out.Eurotrance be damned, long live PsyTrance.WeeksyPsyTrance Lover"
1,It's Not Tom's fault,"This DVD does Tom Knapp no justice he is an amazing shooter but if your buying this DVD to see it up close you won't. The quality of this dvd is horrible, it looks like someone filmed it on a camera phone during a wind storm. I would wait til they put out a better DVD."
2,Necklace with loose onyx,"Looked nice in picture. Looked nice out of bag, less then 10 minutes later onyx fell off. Sure it would have been nice if it had lasted. Had to run out and buy niece something at last minute to replace this. Risky product"
3,A Norton novel for the junior readers,"The characters and settings were a bit simplistic making the novel more suited to the junior reader. Ethnic characterizations however, are the weak point of the novel and some readers might find them politically incorrect."
4,Efective use of Visual Programming and OO programming,"Few books tell you the proper way to use Visual Programming tools alongside Object Oriented concepts. Even when I use VAJ 2.0, this book avout VAJ 1.0 proved to be an invaluable guide.If just the authors could write another book expanding on the subect of Visual Design patterns... :-)"

1,Dead on Arrival,My bald cyprus tree forest order arrived dead and bare. It was a group of 9 dead sticks. I am in the process of returning for refund.
1,absolutely disappointing,"The CD snaesthesia by Andy Summers has disappointed at the least. A home made childish scratching on an electric guitar and a playing with all type of effects whithout taking the time to realy find the reasons of such effects. There is neither harmony nor a single music method. The CD is one of the worst CDs I have EVER heard and if it where not Andy Summers, I would not believe that such music is possible to be sold. The sadest thing is that there are music productions and labels who offer such ""music"", just for the name of the musician. Sorry, I can not say a single good thing for this CD."
5,brilliant record,"Some say that this is the worst spiritualized record because it is more *pop*...I'd have to disagree and say this is one of the best spiritualized records. The songs are still very spacey yet have more of an edge. J is writing some of his best material yet with this record, and I'm excited to hear new stuff as I hear he is back in the studio working on a new record.Some say he shouldn't have gotten rid of the other band members and the music suffered because of that...ha!...some say he needs to get back on the smack to make good music...ha!...with a record like this, who needs drugs!Other recent buys which I would totally recommend are Cobolt-""Spirit On Parole"" (a must for fans of the melancholy, slow-rock fused with space elements), Yo La Tengo's new record, and Talvin Singh-""OK""."
5,Ground Control........,"Written at a time of romantic breakup that was not dulled by J. Spaceman's substance abuse, this release contains some of Spiritualized's finest moments.Tracks like COME TOGETHER, I THINK I'M IN LOVE, ELECTRICITY, COOL WAVES and the 17 minute opus COP SHOOT COP are all hallmarks of this bands (J. Spaceman aka Jason Pierce) canon. There may be a few tracks that float off too far into the ether, but overall this is a true sonic masterpeice.As good as this is, and I would heartily recommend it, I would probably tip my hat to LASER GUIDED MELODIES as this bands best release. Together they are two of the most musically adventurous albums released in the 90's."
1,Disappointing Album,"This is a textbook example of style over substance. While there are hardly any good songs on this ponderous mediocrity, the packaging and styling is superb. It is designed to look like a prescription drug package and is pretty creative. What bogles the mind are the plethora of British journalists who couldnt bring themselves to give this disposable junk less than 5 stars and perfect marks. Had they put the time used making interesting packaging into carving out a decent melody or two, this could have been a fantastic album, as the style is very ethereal and evocative."
1,Boring Boring Boring Sidney,"Bought this because I was a big fan of the first two albums, but I must say, I was pretty let down. Maybe its just me, but it seems less cohesive and well put together. Who knows, maybe I'll change my mind with time."
5,"mind-blowing, captivating, one of my all-time favorites.","From what I've heard from other people who have listened to Spiritualized's music, they either love it or loathe it. This is unquestionably my favorite Spiritualized album. It's the first album I purchased of theirs, and I still think it's superior to their previous efforts. It may be described as repetitive, but it's never monotonous. The title ""..floating in space"" suits it perfectly. It's overwhelmingly vast (it could fill the universe) and still hits hard. Whether you want the blues-y mellow feel of Cop Shoot Cop.. or the choral Cool Waves or the foot-tappin I Think I'm In Love, this album retains its beauty throughout (aside from The Individual which I always have to skip over). I love Jason Pierce's voice also; it fits the songs perfectly."
1,Pretentious Album Fails to Live Up To Hype,"I bought this album because I enjoyed Lazer Guided Melodies and Pure Phase. I was hoping I'd get more of the same dreamy, beautiful melodies. Boy, was I disappointed. I wouldn't recommend this album to anyone except the Spiritualized completist. Maybe next time around Spiritualized will live up to the hype."
3,Almost a *4* depending on your mood,"Ladies and Gents won Spiritualized critical praise and a small amount of mainstream recognition. While the album was better than 98%of other releases and deserved some of the praise, it is not the best album by Spiritualized. The thing with this album is that it accomplished bandleader Jason Pierce's melding of traditional soul and gospel with old school psych-pop. The results are decidedly mixed: the title track, ""I think I'm in Love,"" ""Stay with Me,""Broken Heart,"" and ""Cool Waves"" are exactly what the whole album should sound like. However the rest of the album doesn't work to great affect. ""Cop Shoot Cop"" is too long and the other songs sort of meander as well. In my opinion the previous two albums are much better."
4,Ladies & Gentlemen We Are Floating in Space,"Ladies & Gentlemen We Are Floating in Space being Spiritualized 3rd studio album and their 1997 release can be said to be a mix of post rock, Britt rock and space rock. The album was hailed by the critics when it was released and The Guardian, Allmusic and NME all gave it high marks. The booklet is very neat and resembles a prescription for a medicine. The lyrics are not included in the booklet but we get a list of whom plays what. Not easy listening but a very cerebral experience and it sounds a bit like Bowie and late Beatles. 4/5."
1,Spend Your Money on a Worthier Contender,"As a long time Spiritualized fan, I can tell you your best bet is to move on and invest your money in a better album (and there are countless better albums than this sonic garbage). Aside from the many valid criticisms made of this album (style over substance, lack of decent melodies, over-production, etc) this album simply lacks the pioneering spirit of earlier recordings. I think many of the prior reviews confused excess with artistic and creative exploration. The two are not connected in any way as is apparent on this depressingly poor album. Although it has been mentioned by many others, I want to comment on the paucity of decent melodies on this album. With the exception of perhaps one or two songs, this album is terrible and relies entirely on over dramatization to create its effect. Avoid at all costs, even if youre a fan."
2,All the Reviews have good points,"Its strange how everyone feels one way or the other about this CD. I agree that it lacks a little in the melody department, but I think some of the reviews were a little too harsh. It is definitely an interesting artistic, personal statement of yearning for love in an age of machines and emotion-numbing drugs. I think it is best appreciated when high or in a contemplative, serene mood. Buy this album and decide for yourself."
2,OK Album Overshadowed by Superior Offerings,"I thought this album was pretty good, but not nearly as good as some of the other albums released in 1997. Radioheads OK Computer, and The Verves Urban Hymns were better, although I have to admit that Spiritualized went out on an artistic limb to an extent not approached by other British artists. Ive always found them to be a good band, and look forward to their next release."
1,Unimpressive,The numerous negative reviews speak for themselves. This is a bad album and regression for an othewise talented musician.
2,Not Very Good,"If you want spacey, dreamy music, stick with My Bloody Valentine, Slowdive, Ride, and other early 90's pillars of the shoe gazer movement.This album tries to incorporate that sound with trumpets, jazz, and gospel and the result does not work at all. Not a bad album, but not a good one either."
4,Words cannot describe this...,"I first heard the song ""Ladies and Gentlemen we are floating in space"" in the movie Vanilla Sky (an awesome movie) and I just had to find out who the Artist was! This song got me hooked on Spiritualized! Their sound is like no other, it just blew me away. I have to buy this cd!! :)"
4,Space Floaters--This one's for you.,"I'm a huge fan of the band, but I'd have to say this is my least favorite of their albums. ""I Think I'm In Love"" and ""Electricity"" are two of their best tracks, but some of the other songs could use some trimming (how long can one float in space without feeling uncomfortably spacey?). Nevertheless, I still put this one in the CD player on a regular basis because Spiritualized is one of the most original and inventive bands out there. I'd suggest ""Lazer-Guided Melodies"" as the one to get you hooked; once you're on board, you'll buy all the other ones anyway. This is how I occupy altered realms without drugs--this is sonic mental alteration at its best."
1,This has taught me a lesson...,"NEVER LISTEN TO U.K. MUSIC REVIEWERS! I read a ton of ink about this band, how great they were, how revolutionary they were, and not to mention how cool their packaging was. This record is utter crap. It's start to finish self-indulgent rock meanderings that were better done by the Velvet Underground and Sonic Youth. It does make a lovely coaster for drinks though..."
1,Don't believe the hype!,"This album is, simply put, awful. Everyone in the chatroom of a popular British music weekly magazine were drooling over this release back when it came out, so naturally, I went and purchased it. Being that at that time I was on painkillers for a dental procedure, it was interesting. But then reality kicked in several days later. I really and truly feel that they put bricks on random keys on the keyboard and leave them there for long periods of time while Jason Pierce lies around shooting up, mumbling random things. If you want 'trip' music, go buy The Verve's ""Storm in Heaven"" CD.Do yourself a favour: Do NOT fall for the hype like I did with these simps. I wasted money on not one, but TWO of their discs."
2,What Is This,"I Am an Optimist but I Am also a Realist, some people would give something in the road dead a good review but there are some things nothing good can be said about it.I bought 2 books ""The Good Home"" and ""The Cabin"" The Cabin is a little bit better but both are over priced, $8.00 would be a better price. they are a professional looking books hard cover with high gloss pictures.The information these books give have little to be desired, sometime these books will tell what materials was used and a little bit about the history of the owenrs but that is about it.If You are look for a these books to show You how to build it, forget it! these books are more like if they were written by a real-estate agent or something not a Carpenter."
2,Wierd to the Max,"cloning is a sensitve topic. I wish it told more about how they did it, and not how the aliens talked to the guy about all that made up crap. I hope the cult clonaid does not come find me and kill me, then use my stem cells to clone people..."
2,I really liked the idea of an herbal ...,I really liked the idea of an herbal supplement that would help enhance my mood. But after taking the easy to swallow capsules I really didn't notice any significant difference in my overall mood -- only that I felt a little bit more relaxed a little while after taking the pills.
2,The only difference between this product and some ...,The only difference between this product and some others I've used is that the Nature's Resource didn't upset my stomach. It was also nice having to take it just once a day...easier to get a full dose. I'd recommend it to others.
3,It's likely that I didn't give this product ...,"It's likely that I didn't give this product ample time to work in my system. I don't believe it's a bad product, but I didn't see much of a difference while using it. However, the up side is that I didn't see a change for the worse, which leads me to believe that taking this product over time would improve the spirit and work even better. I'd say it's worth giving a try."
2,gives me headaches; YMMV,"This stuff gives me headaches -- I've found that the Kira or Perika brands are much better for this. I recently tested it again after running out of Perika, thinking ""maybe it was just a matter of adjusting to different dosages or something the first time,"" but nope, the headaches returned as soon as I started taking this one, and stopped as soon as I got out my remaining Kira tablets (usually in my travel toiletries) and started taking them instead. It may be just fine for you and it's certainly cheaper than those other brands, but there's something in them that my system doesn't tolerate well."
4,Good book - worth the read!,"This book is a very interesting story and, although the author, I feel, detours a bit giving bio's of everyone, it is still an interesting book to the end. It explores somewhat how a girl raised in a healthy, good environment can easily get into prostitution and how this lifestyle hurt her family. The professor who pursued her and led a double life is an interesting character as well."
2,told history of every one not associated with book,she kept getting off track by talking about every one in the story who was not really involved with the murder. to long she could have cut the book down by about 300 pages
2,Didn't last more than a month!!,This was a late x-mas present for youngest adult son to go with his camera. This was the right size made for his point and shoot camera he got at the same time. Today one of the legs broke off just below the camera attachment. It was a large investment to only last for a month!! Would not buy this one again!!
5,Very good and handy tripod.,This product works very well and in all kind of environments. I purchased it for my mobile phone and it works great. Very light and you can fit it in every bag and shape you want. If you take videos with your phone this comes very handy.
2,flimsy,"This is good for a small point and shoot only, I have a Canon T4i and this baby will not hold up. Great idea but too weak to hold the DSLR."
3,OK for a small camera,Could be a bit stiffer in the flexible joints. Can be used for many unusual photography applications. Does work OK.
3,Hard to position,"I thought this would be a lot more easy to position. Unfortunately all the parts are plastic and have no lubrication to allow them to move smoothly. Maybe with use it will limber up a bit but to get it to bend it's pretty hard. I like that the feet are grippy though, that helps keep the stand stable while you adjust your mounted camera."
4,Great little tri-pod,Light weight and perfect for a small digital camera. Fits in jacket pocket or day bag for ease of use. The flexibility makes outdoor pictures from uneven surfaces easy. Even held up in heavy winds!
4,Perfect for a small camera.,"I use this baby Gorillapod Tripod mostly for filming with my Kodak Zi8 portable video camera and it works great.Pros:1 - Easy to adjust the legs2 - Easy to attach camera (just screw it right on to the top)3 - Sturdy for small camerasCons:1 - Not for use on midsize cameras. It's just too small and will not be sturdy enough.2 - I wish the legs were longer (better yet, I wish I had bought the larger one) so that I could wrap them better around objects."
3,Joby - great product - some cons,"Great product, helped us get some great pics. But one of the links keeps coming off - so we got a little scared of putting it up in dangerous spots/positions."
5,Great product!,This thing is not only cool but very handy. It fits into your pocket. It is strong enough to take abuse as well as hold my camera at any angle. Very cool. Everyone who see's me using it asks about it. Cool factor = 10!
4,TINY!,I had no idea this tripod was SO TINY! It can't support my DSLR.It works fine for a regular camera
5,So fun!,"I used to just sit my camera on the base to take timed pics and the like, but my new camera cannot stand on its own, so I needed a tripod of some form. I saw this and liked the portability and price. It's so fun! From taking close up macro food shots, to fixing it on a chair for those timed group shots, to long exposure night shots, to attaching it to my rearview mirror and recording my drive home, it's just fun. The joints are quite tight and it will hold well on to whatever you attach it to. It changed the way I take pictures!"
4,Good basic tripod,"Very functional flexible tripod. As noted in other reviews the anchor screw does come loose fairly easily, but tripod has been handy for the few times we have needed it. Once set, very stable for our small Sony camcorder and Kodak camera. If you are a big camera buff or use a tripod on a regular basis, you will want to upgrade to a larger more rugged version. Don't think this one will support a large SLR camera...?"
2,Weak,"Supports very little weight and the quick release is fairly difficult to use. Not terrible, but expensive for what it is. Supports very small cameras OK, though even the pressure of clicking the shutter may well move the camera. Best used with a timer delay."
3,Nice Tripod,"Very compact and portable. Has great grip, but cannot handle relatively heavy point and shoots. Also difficult to set to shoot straight up. Otherwise, great simple and quick tripod"
5,Love it!,Don't know how I lived without this little thing for so long. Super usable with a small digital camera. Don't try to use it for a slr or full-sized camera. Easy to position. I plan to buy several more and keep them in my bags.
2,not strong enough,I have heard such great things about gorillapods so I went ahead and purchased one. I don't use it. It's small and not at all sturdy. I put my Nikon d60 on it with the 18-55 lens and the gorillapod kept bending forward under the went of the camera and lens. I wouldn't dare use this by wrapping it's legs around something because I don't trust it.
3,Joby GP1 Gorillapod Tripod (Blue),Product arrived fast. I honestly thought it would be a little bigger. Overall impression is the the gorillapod can be useful for using around the house. I don't recommend using outdoor. At home I use my canon camcorder to record my kids playing/interacting with us.
2,Not for professional grade cameras,"I was hoping this would due as my ""in a pinch"" tripod for my Canon Rebel xsi. I fastened it on and it immediately fell over. It will not hold the weight of the camera even with a very small lens on it. I will probably try to resell it to get some money back."
2,Didn't meet my expectation,"I was afraid of buyding this but after reading many review from other people, I decided to buy one to use it on my Canon Powershot S3IS camera.Maybe I wasn't using it right but it was very unstable. Maybe my camera was too heavy for this. I liked the concept of this design but it never worked for me. I ended up giving it to my friend who has smaller digital camera as a birthday gift. Never heard from him since then."
3,So so,got this from my son and never really worked well with his Nikon point and shoot. Just not as stable as would have like and a little too short. Not a product flaw as much we should have bought a taller version.
2,Not for me,I purchased the product to hold my optma projector.the tripod is very light so can thold itYou can move the legs but ot s horrible - impossible to find the centerNot formr
1,C'mon guys!!!!,"Cmon guys!!! Get real. This item is made in China and is sold regularly on Alibaba for a few bucks. I can understand if the case was you guys were providing a ""service"" with the item that somehow increased it value i.e English user guide etc. But clearly there is no ""service"" or ""added value"" being provided. I guess it's a case of buyer BEWARE !!!!!"
3,A Little Disappointed,"I know it said for point and shoots but I guess I just didn't realize how tiny it really was. The pictures are misleading, They make it look bigger than it really is... I guess maybe they should state Actual Size on the photos, lol. Just beware, it's REALLY small. I don't shoot with P&S, I shoot with DSLR's, but I didn't buy this for the camera, I bought it to hold an external flash or extra light to rig up in my macro tent. But still... disappointed in it's small size."
1,Broke within a week!,"Since the leg came out of the socket within the first week while using my Kodak zi6 pocket camera, I recommend that people don't buy it, unless they want a bi-pod."
4,Great product overall but kind of expensive,"The Joby Gorillapod is great for when you want to take pictures and you don't have a level surface to balance your camera on. You literally can wrap it around a railing or pole and it will stay there. We have used the device on many family trips and have taken more pictures with everyone in them than ever before. The design is compact and light so it travels easily in any camera bag or purse. The only reason why I didn't give 5 stars was because for a fairly simple device, it is kind of expensive considering it is free to use a ledge or just asking someone to take your picture for you."
5,Works great with my Digital and my Vidcam as well,This works exactly as described with my Canon digital camera .. but what I didn't expect is how good it works with my Panasonic harddrive video camera! It was solid and stable on a table top .. I haven't tried attaching it in a wierd position and not sure if I would with the vid camera but I'm still very satisfied with this.
4,"Great Innovative tripod, but there is still a little room for imporvement","Don't get me wrong, I love the innovative design of this tripod, and it's ease of use, however, there were times when the rubber grips don't stick as well as you would think. Overall, the purchase was worth the money, especially if you take many pictures and you want everyone included. This is a much better option than setting the camera on the nearest level surface. Great buy!"
4,Camra Stand,"Works great, holds the Nikon Coolpix P100 just fine. The only thing I would like to see imporved on this item is the lingth of the legs. You have to have something small to grip the legs on, but it can't be too week, or it wont hold the camera."
4,Travel must,"Compact and easy to travel with, provides great camera flexibility when you are taking pics with the auto timer or a remote. Love the fun colors Joby comes in now. Also have the big gorillapod for my dslr"
5,Love the flexibility of this tripod!,"This makes it very easy to use in so many different situations. I loved having this on our recent camping trip, being able to get a great shot while this was hanging from a tree branch. It is a bit difficult to get it fully strait again, once you have twisted it all around."
4,Pretty good,"This thing is really handy. I use it with my Panasonic GF-2. The camera is a little bit too big for this tripod, and I probably should have gotten the bigger one meant for DSLRs, but I wanted to save money. Even though sometimes it can get wobbly with my camera, it mostly works just fine. Whenever I am in a weird place and want to get the camera to hold still, this thing works every time. It's especially good if you want to take a picture from an outdoor railing that is round and the camera won't lie flat on it."
4,Great compact tripod for small cameras,"This a very handy mini tripod for small cameras. You can mount it to just about anything, great for the solo hunter etc. Be aware that the top ring on the 1st ball below the camera mount is use as a camera mount lock and has to be rotated to unlock to slide the camera off the tripod while leaving the tripod mounted to what ever you may want to leave it attached to. I did not realize this and broke mine as soon as I took it out of the box, my fault not the tripod the instructions were on the back of the box it came in."
5,Perfect Camera Mount for Angelcare,"We purchased this when we purchased the angelcare monitoring system as a camera mount. It does exactly what we needed. It is affordable, and we would recommend anyone looking for a mount for the angelcare system to go with this tripod."
5,Excellent,"Is small in size is not suitable for the camera made &#8203;&#8203;for the larger erred appreciation and I wished I was a little large, yet it is so wonderful, thank you"
4,Works as expected,Saw it in use and had to get one of my own. Supports my sd90 perfectly - great for setting up timed group pictures.
4,First tripod,"Works about as well as could be expected, now I can be more versatile with my photography."
3,Tripod,"Appeared to be much much larger but obviouslyit wasn't. I think more info on its actual size should of beenpresented at least as much as the events making it look large as i took it yo be.I gave this as a gift, but she used a cigar box toset it on once her Point N Shoot was attached to it.The only draw back, everything else is cool.She would NOT let me rtn it."
4,Pictures anywhere!,"This product works great. It does what is says it will do. Grip, flex, crate most objects into a place to put your camera. You want a picture of yourself on the monkey bars? This a product for you."
4,Love this item!,"I received this as a gift before going away to Disney world. It was perfect for taking shots at night when one needs a stable hand. With the rubber ends, I could place it on anything pretty much! I would highly recommend it. I put a 4 only because it took a bit of space in my backpack that I would have liked."
4,Cool Product,"I have the smallest Gorillapod and it works perfectly with my little point and shoot camera.The plastic locking ring is a little hard to use though, so I will probably never fully lock my camera onto the tripod. But that's okay because the camera seems to feel pretty sturdy when it's just snapped into place without being locked. Now I can take self portraits on the trail without my arm always being stretched out in the pictures!"
5,Neat tripod makes fun gift,This waas purchased as a stocking stuffer for my granddaughter. She was surprised by it and loves it. She frequently records her music lessons with the digital camera and it's tough finding a way to set it up. This will help
3,Works but design flaws,"The plastic lock is horribly hard to use, very difficult to turn. Your best bet is to leave it unlocked and use the release button as the lock."
1,waste of money,bought the SLR version for my nikon D70s connected it up tried to use it on a verticle pipe and it flopped all over the place not stable at all. Would not take the weight as stated.
2,Camera too heavy for this,"Before buying this product make sure your camera is does not weigh too much. I don't know how much is too much though, and the product description has no limits on camera weight. I have a Panasonic Lumix and this tripod can't stay upright because of the weight of the camera."
2,dont buy for a video camera,This item is to flimsy to support a small video camera has too much shake should purchase the largest one they make.
3,Disappointed,I was disappointed by this product because it was not clear online that this was the small version of the tripod. I needed the larger one but it was not clear that I was not getting what I needed.
3,So Cute,"Although I haven't had a chance to use it, the concept is great -- I can hang it anywhere! The only con is that it is a little shorter than I would like. However, I wanted one I could stick in my purse, so the one with longer legs would not work for me."
2,Flexible Tripod,"BUYER BEWARE!!! Although this seems to be adequately sized it is actually really small!!! I have a Sony Alpha A100 DSLR camera and this tripod is way to small to support it properly. If you were looking for a cheaper one than the ones in wal-mart or another store, this is not like them at all. If you have a smaller camera like the one in the picture, then go for it!"
2,Didn't hold my Canon A80 very well.,I got this yesterday and today it's all packed up for return. I have a Canon A80 that I use a lot. The thought behind the Gorillapod made sense to me for enhancing the use of it indoors and out. The Gorillapod for Digital cameras has pretty short legs and it slid down a pole light with a smooth surface I attached it to. I figured I'd be able to take a 90 degree downward shot with the camera but it started to sag. The Canon A80 isn't a heavy Digital SLR...I like the theory behind the Gorillapod that I'm gonna look for the SLR model on sale and buy it. The SLR model has 9 inch long legs and the digital Gorillapod has ~ 5 inch legs.I'd probably like this version if it had longer legs. Tho that wouldn't fix the sagging problem.....sigh!:)
1,Completely useless,"Unless you're trying to hold up an EXTREMELY light item and the screwhole is PERFECTLY in the center, then do NOT get this item.It will slump to one side or the other and can't hold up an item that only weighs 1.5lbs."
1,Cheap and Breaks Easily,"Cheap plastic and breaks easily. Make sure you check the top ball, mine was cracked. So camera just falls over."
1,Too little to hold anything,I bought this just to hold a flash for photography... either just standing on the ground or wrapped on a tree limb... No way.. Way to little. I'm not sure what this is good for. Certainly not a real flash. In fact the hotshoe mount just popped right off the top.
2,Broke!!!,"This is my second Gorrilla Pod from Joby. The first one served me pretty well for our point and shoot camera. It was sooooo highly praised by each and every person who saw it, even strangers...tht i thought I would gift it to someone I knew would use it because I could always buy a new one. So, I placed the order once again for another one because it has become indispensable for us. Also, I went for Joby even though there were other cheaper ones available for 5-8 dollars or so. I was apprehensive due to their bad reviews and Joby sounded more promising...and why not, it was so expensive. It was expected to serve me well.But I was wrong. It broke. I have used it for not more than 2 months or so...and its already useless. I am not if I can get a refund or not. Neither am I sure of going for Joby again. its disappointing and shameful because I see too many reviews on these lines now. That is so unfair on Joby's part to make such defective pieces and sell them too."
2,Small size = very unstable,"I use this with my micro 4/3 camera system. The adjustment is too wobbly and not precise for long focus shots. When taking time lapse photos, I have to worry about the whole tripod shaking, and therefor ruining the shot. i would only recommend for small point and shoot cameras."
3,Not long enough,I was expecting something with long legs actually. I tried it on my balcony's fences but the legs are not long enough to hold it tight. It can slip easily to one side.
2,Not very sturdy,"This thing just isn't built well enough to hold my D5100. You can totally forget it if you have a big lens or flash on the camera.I'd suggest, get yourself a real tripod. This thing is cheap and small, and it probably won't do what you're looking for. For a smaller camera? Probably ok, seems like a good idea.Maybe my bad for expecting more than it was designed for."
5,Cool item,"Very cool product, it is like a toy for the adults. Everyone that comes over wants to play with it"
3,it is not strong,"I bought two of these for two off camera flashes (430 EX II and a 3rd party one)The tripods do not support the weight of the flashes. They obey gravity more than the tripod's strength, but the tripod is still useful for hanging the flashes or other strange placements. I think the 2 tripods will be useful but wish they were stronger"
4,New to product,It's a small tripod which worked well for packing and taking around various vacation sites. I didn't give it a 5 because the tripod spins while in the locked position.
5,Great tripod for my Canon,"I finally gave in and bought my Canon S95 on a daily deal here on Amazon. A few months later, this handy little accessory pops up on a deal (I'm a Deal of the Day junky - what can I say!)This little tripod (and it is that - little) is great for slow shutter pictures. I've tried taking a 5 second picture and it's just not possible to be that still! Haha.The flexible arms not only allow for wrapping around objects, but also simple aiming up and down or tilting. It attaches and detaches from the camera very easily and the screw in mount into the camera doesn't get in the way if you leave it on at all times.Great gadget for the small point-and-shoots!"
3,Good for light cameras only,"If you've got a point and click, this thing is fantastic, however SLR's or even anything close to the weight of an SLR will cause this to shake like a leaf on a tree. I have a Canon SX10 IS (big body, but not SLR) and find myself having to use the 10 second timer to get a still shot. It literally takes about 8 seconds for it to stop shaking from the act of pushing the shutter button as carefully as possible...doesn't that defeat the whole purpose of a tripod? It also simply will not support the weight of my camera oriented vertically, grasping a pole, which is an advertised use of the product.Maybe their larger models are more stiff and adapt to heavy cameras, but the fact is that the product photos here on Amazon show it used with a large SLR. Misleading...lead to dissatisfaction."
5,Great for Biking!,"I recently purchased this tripod for my Sony camcorder, because I wanted to do some self filming while riding a bike. This tripod wraps perfectly around my handle bars. I couldn't be more satisfied. Great item."
4,"Great for Zoom H1, H2, Kodak Zi8",Length:: 2:18 MinsI bought this for my pocket video cameras and for my pocket portable audio recorders. This is the cheapest and most versatile product out there for travel stability.
1,"I was excited about this tripod, but...","it's just not as good as I thought it would be. It doesn't really attach to things the way it's advertised. I tried to use it on a railing at a basketball game, and I couldn't get it tight enough to hold my camera steady. The legs keep coming apart, too. (they have that ball-and-socket construction - the balls keep popping out of the sockets!)I wouldn't buy this again."
3,"Good concept, but limited utility","When you can get a good shot with a 6"" high tripod, its the best. I mean you need to have some prop at a suitable height where you can mount the flexible tripod. However, practically this does not always happen. Also, its not good in a windy place due to excessive vibrations. Nonetheless, it held my canon sx260 pretty well under normal conditions. Setting the camera at the perfect angle can be tricky with this tripod since the movements are not easily controlled, in other words they are not as swift as a professional tripod. But one can give it a try considering the tiny price tag."
5,Works fine with Sony off-center tripod mount,"Got a Joby ""Original"" GP1 for Xmas to use with my Sony DSC-HX5v point and shoot. Camera specs say that it weighs around 7.5 ounces including battery and memory card. The tripod mount position is as far off center as it could possibly be. I was concerned, based on some reviews, that the camera would not be supported in a level position when attached to the tripod because of the offset mounting position. My concerns were unfounded and the Gorillapod holds the camera securely and level without any problem...just make sure that 2 of the 3 legs are located under the more heavily weighted side of the camera. For now, I'm very satisfied with the tripod and only hope that it stands up to the test of time."
1,Wasn't what I expected - broke in 2 days,Cheap quality. Leg broke off with no abuse in 2 days. Not strong enough to really grip or hold onto anything. The flexibility in positioning does not make up for the ease of use and easy leveling of a regular tripod.
5,Small-but great,"These are great! Works like a charm. It's small, but holds the weight of the camera which frankly surprised me."
2,A little cheap,Disappointed in this particular model. It does not Grip like other gorillapods i've used before. It's made of cheap hollow plastic and the rubber grips aren't that grippy. It will work for basic applications just like a standard tripod but I wouldn't trust it clinging to anything while your expensive equipment is attached to it.
1,Gorillapod did not last,"This was a much wanted Christmas gift for my son to use with his iphone but it did not even last a month. It broke already and we are very disappointed since we made sure to get the Gorillapod brand instead of a cheaper version, thinking we would get great quality. Would very much like a replacement."
1,junk,"The legs on this keep coming off just like most people say.Even with just picking it up they fall right off, and they fall off every time. I thought with all the reviews this might work but not at all."
1,Bad Item,Just received the Joby Gorillapod and am very unhappy. It can not hold a light camcera without sliding down and will not stay stable. I own the exact item from another company which works great. This one is horrible so I am led to believe this dealer is selling a product that did not meet the Joby quality contol standards. I will try to return it. It also was shipped without any paper work which leads me to believe I am going to have a problem. We will see.------------ Up date---- Thanks to Amazon I received a refund.
5,Simple does it,"Simple packaging, nice tight fit to the camera, stiff connection to the ""ground"". I previously bought a metal version of this made by another company and there was machine oil over uncovered metal. Who thought that would work?!"
2,No better than the knock-offs,"After using a few unbranded versions of this 'pod, I decided that maybe the genuine one would hold up better. I bought this 7 months ago and have used it maybe 40-50 times. Almost always just as an upright 'pod and only occasionally wrapping it around something. Well, it's broken already. The main post has separated from the legs and doesn't want to stay attached anymore. With the other ones, it was always the legs that started popping apart, but it's essentially the same thing - the engineering just isn't quite there yet. For the price and lack of a warranty, I'm going back to the knock-offs."
4,Pretty useful little tripod!,"This is a great tripod for a point and shoot. I've attached it to chairs, poles, benches, tree branches, etc. Great for some still video without having to carry around a huge tripod."
5,cool item,used with flip recorder-it works pretty good and i like having it as an option. i didn't realize there were different sizes so make sure you know which one youre buying.
4,Up to 9.7 oz is best case,"Up to 9.7 oz. is the best case which means screw position of the camera is balanced point.And the explanation at Technical Details, 9.7 ounces (325 grams) is not correct. 9.7 oz. = 275 g."
5,The BEST purchase I have made for my camera.,"The Joby Gorillapod is by far, the best purchase I have ever made for my camera. It is a must have product for anyone who is serious about video and photography. The versatility of this product is nearly unmatched and the quality is leaps and bounds above competitors. The strong and stiff bendable joints coupled with the high quality rubber grips allow the user to place this tripod on nearly any surface imaginable. I know from experience and have tested the stability of this tripod on many surfaces such as uneven grass and soil, wrapped around branches, bedposts and arm rests and even on the side view mirror of my car and the tripod never failed to hold its grip. It is a must buy product and I cannot recommend it enough. You will not be disappointed."
2,Gorillapod? Plz...,"Very, very small (monkey) pod. Would recomend only for very small/light point and shoots etc..."
1,Gorillapod tripod,"My Gorillapod was to have arrived by Dec. 16. It still has not arrived, and it is too late for my use. I will be canceling the order on my Citicard."
4,my first tripod!,"i was browsing through amazon looking for a tripod a couple days ago. then i happen to stumble upon this weird looking alien-like tripod! read the reviews and ordered one out of good comments. got it like 2 days later! great shipping amazon! :] i quickly opened the box! i love everything about it! it fits great with my sd900! i just wish it can extend... so yea, this is going to help with my macro shots alot!"
4,Nice gift,"I ordered one for each of my three sons for Christmas. They opened them and immediately started twining the legs around chairs and other objects in the room to see how well they worked. My sons are all in their 30s and all have digital cameras. They were talking together about the different ways they could use the tripods and I knew that they were happy with the gift. The only thing I might change is the plastic, I think a slightly ""sticky"" plastic might work better in many applications. All in all I think this is a nice product."
4,flexible tripod,"The flexible tripod was a gift,the party that recieved it says it is just what the needed for when they go (tent)camping.They have to travel light and this is just great."
4,Does What It Says It Does,"A great item for those unusual angles and/or for night shots where an even flat surface is unavailable. A very useful feature is its ability to detach the top from the rest of the unit. So if you don't want to keep screwing and unscrewing it every time you need to use it or not use it, you can simply detach the top, even put the camera and the tripod top in your camera case, then just slide it in when necessary. As for the entire tripod itself, attach it just about anywhere, compose your shot and let it do the rest. The only real complaint is that it's actually harder to use on a flat level surface, since this requires lining up all three legs to just the right height. However, it is very easy to do and requires little effort."
5,"Simple, compact and SO effective!","The concept here is so simple, yet it's so VERY effective! It collapses easily, sets up easily, and grips almost anything! I say almost because I tried to grip the edge of an open door... maybe a little beyond its intended use! The removable screw-on tab is genious and works just like a full-sized tripod, but I tend to just screw it on and off like my old mini-tripod. There are rubber rings around each ""bulb"" that make up the ball and socket type legs, and they help grip whatever it is you're mounting your camera to... tree limbs, door knobs, crib rails, you name it! Of course it's also a great regular tri-pod that allows you to take the priceless family farewell phot from the hood of the car. The rubber feet keep it from sliding or damaging your paint! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED, especially for the price!"
4,twojps,This is a great tripod and we use it a lot in all sorts of settings and it works better than imagined! Love it and we will get more.
5,flexible tripod,"EXCELLENT is the only word to describe the Gorillapod. The ease and convenience with which it can be set up almost anywhere to hold the camera at almost any angle, are fantastic.May be, there should be a warning to the user against the possibility of the camera getting out of balance and getting damaged in a fall. This can hardly be considered a fault of the tripod; it is simply the physics of the weight of the camera and the lightness of the tripod, which is really its most attractive feature. The gorillapod does specify a maximum weight for the camera, but an overt warning against possible damage to camera through a fall is desirable."
5,its GREAT,It s really worth it especially when you travel and need to do pictures of yourself and a whole group.
5,I love everything about this joby.,"It is flexable, but stiff, It is small but adequate for a small camera. I love it."
4,Bought for use while Kayaking,"I bought the Gorillapod so I could take videos while kayaking with my Canon PowerShot D10. The legs do a good job conforming to the lip of the kayak cockpit (though I am not sure what would happen if I used a skirt) and hold the camera steady, even when the camera sometimes gets whacked with my paddle stroke. My only complaint is that one of the feet sometimes comes off when I am adjusting it. It pops back on easily enough, but it is a bit disconcerting. Before I go on my next trip I will probably buy the next size up for my Canon PowerShot S2 IS."
5,BEST TRIPOD EVER,take a picture and be on it every time!! no need to ask others to take the pic for you! I have benn using this tripor for 2 years now and is the best accessory I could ever get foy my compact camera... I bought other brand for a gift and it is not good at all!... they I realize how lucky I was for buying gorillapod at my first time!... its very compact. easy to use.. no mantainance required... light weight... you can attach it virtualy everywhere
4,Worth having a tripod like this one.,"I have used multiple tripods over the years -- all of them rigid, extendable type. The flexibility of the legs of this one puts it in a different league. You can hang it to pretty much anything. I only wish it were longer."
5,so cool!!,"I love this tripod!! I was at the beach, and wanted to take a self timer. I found the nearest tree, wrapped the tripod around the branch, and bammo!! Mission accomplished!! Yay!"
5,need longer legs,I really like the product. It tests your creativity to get it mounted and it would be easier if the legs were longer. I may have to buy the next size larger also.
5,the cutest thing ...,"and it works. i have the shakes. when i take pictures i need to take 'lots' before i get one!! anyway, this little guy is making me look very pro. what a sweet little gadget. and it works."
2,Short & tiny.,I was expecting at least 12 inches but it's only 5 inches from where the 3 legs joined and another inch and a half to the camera. I wish they would put that in the description. Returning it for a refund to buy another taller one.
4,smaller then I thought,I think this will be and is a great product for a point and shoot camera! I am only disappointed in the size. I thought it would be longer and larger then it was. Kind of small to wrap.
3,Good but not practical,"I got this for my eBay pictures thinking that the multi position would be a good thing. but what i came to find out is that it will really only hold the camera in one position before it topples over. I would say that this is good for a web cam or something like that that you need just to stay sturdy, but for the price I found better ones out there."
3,too small for med-sized digital slr,great for small camera. won't hold a med-large-sized camera. i have a nikon d60 and this size jpod is too small. ;(
4,ONLY 3 INCHES TALL Max,WAS DISAPPOINTED IT WAS SO SMALL BUT ONCE I USED IT I FOUND IT TO BE THE COOLEST TRIPOD I OWN. PRETTY STURDY TOO. I USE IT WITH MY NIKON L18 VERY LIGHT WEIGHT CAMERA AND IT DOES WHAT IT IS SUPPOSED TO DO. LEGS COULD BE LONGER TO MORE EASILY WRAP AROUND POLES BUT OVER ALL A GREAT PRODUCT.
1,These are not made by Joby - conterfit items,"These are a knock off product - not the real thing.Amazon has been notified that these are fakes, yet the product remains listed.To recognize the real thing you have to look for the JOBY logo on the button near the head.The knockoffs are not as good at holding position and have mold flashing bumps sicking out."
2,Not all that...,"After drooling over the photos on the product page, I could barely contain myself when my Gorillapod arrived. However, life with it is not all that. The legs are a little too flexible, so not only does it fail at the simple function of tripod, it doesn't cling and climb without way too much effort. Way too much money, way too much flash, doesn't deliver."
1,Horrible product,poor quality and fell apart when used.The photo does not reflect that the product is awful.Please doesn't buy this product
4,Good but not what I expected,Good but not what I expected. I measured it to be about 7 inches but I expected at least 2 feet. But other than that it's amazing
5,Awesome,"For todays small digital cameras, this is a must! This tripod can fit in your pocket and grab onto ANYTHING!!!! And it has a quick-release shoe!!!! I totally didn't expect that on something for this price. Too cool. Now I need one for my Nikon D200!"
4,works,the tripod works as you would expect. my daughter uses it for some projects but still seems to like the traditional tripod for most projects. It normally looks like a bent up mess and takes some time to fiddle with the legs to make them straight. its also kind of small best used for close up projects or hooking to something else.
3,"Great product, just doesn't last.","I love these for mounting and filming in a jiffy, however I've gone through a ton of these as they have a very short shelf life and lose their stiffness quite quickly."
1,Broken first use,I attached my camera and it broke in my backpack before I was even able to use it. Pretty disappointed. Hardly even worth the effort of sending it back in for a return now.
3,"Great for SMALL, LIGHT equipment...","I purchased this Gorillapod for my 580EX as a rim light tripod, but it just can't hold it up. If you have a little point-and-shoot, this might be worth the investment, but anything heavier, and you're wasting your money."
2,Not all that great,"Yes, it is very grippy and versatile,but it vibrates a LOT.This is particularly noticeable on cameras with off-centertripod mounts (e.g. Fujifilm F30). Consequently, it isno substitute for a (rigid) table-top or other tripod.It can be handy in situations when real tripods won't work,those cases want careful triggering or time-delayed exposures."
2,broke after a couple of uses,I purchased this for our honeymoon but didn't get to take too many pictures using it because it broke on like the 2nd day of our honeymoon. A couple of the joint in the legs won't stay locked making it impossible to stand or hang the tripod anywhere. I was very disappointed :(
2,Good product - while it lasts,"This tripod WILL break. They last about two years, maybe a little more and then break. Specifically, a break will occur between the top two nodes and the point where the three legs come together near to the top. Not wanting to be on a gorilla pod ""subscription"" i'm seeking out something different. I get so tired of how stuff is made these days."
4,Nice little package,"I can tell the makers put a lot of thought into it. I brought it on a camping trip and immediately was asked where I got it from. The only drawback I can see from a design standpoint is the optional to press somethig and have the legs straighten out automatically for those ""I need a straight shot in the next 5 seconds"" pose. It does take a little fidgeting to make sure the camera is looking straight otherwise and not crooked since everything on here moves. But again... well thought out product."
5,Great!!!,This thing works perfect. I can connect it to anything and the camera is safe from falling...
4,Very handy!,"Great product! Thought it was a little small at first, but after using it I realized how versatile the tripod was! I even used it to prop my iPhone on it and videod with it."
5,Great for a kid who records himself!,"This item is ideal for someone who wants to record a video with something like a flip, but is alone. Instead of finding a rickety way to support the cam, this item allows someone to position the cam exactly how and where they want. It works perfectly (and its fun to play with, too!)."
3,Pretty much as it looks,"This is OK, but not much more. I'm using it with a point & shoot camera. There is one issue that I have that led me to a lower rating. Once you bend the thing, it is not a easy as you might think to get it back to the original. It's not really impacted my use, but I could see that it has some potential if I used it a lot."
5,Great Tripod!,"Very useful tripod, just what I needed for my canon powershot SD750, it fits it perfectly. I do recommend this."
4,It's Alright But....,I bought this tripod for my Flip Video and the tripod is a bit too small for the camera. (the camera is also too heavy) You get what you pay for but so far the legs of the tri-pod legs are too small for most surfaces that I put it on.
1,Not that great.,"I got this for Christmas, and was thrilled, but one of the legs came off before I even took one photo. Then another leg fell off while posing it. I was able to put it back together, and was thrilled, stood it up without the camera on it, a leg fell off again. When I put it back together the last time I cracked the plastic where the leg goes rending it useless.So Not very thrilled with this gorillapod, maybe I got a lemon?"
3,No substitute for real tripods,"Yes, it is very grippy and versatile,but it vibrates a LOT.This is particularly noticeable on cameras with off-centertripod mounts (e.g. Fujifilm F30). Consequently, it isno substitute for a (rigid) table-top or other tripod.It can be handy in situations when real tripods won't work;those cases want careful triggering or time-delayed exposures."
5,"great product, but be careful","I really dig this product for a lot of reasons - mainly becuase, it's small, light, sturdy and easy to deal with. I bought this product because it seemed like the perfect compliment to the way that I use my digital camera - on the go. However, one thing to keep your eyes out for is the fact that when I got my unit home and went' to connect it to my camera, I realized that I didn't check my camera to see where the screw-in mount was oriented - my camera, a Nikon Coolpix has this screw in mount on the left side of the camera - not in the middle. With such a small tripod, if I stuck all the legs out straight, just like regular tripod, my setup would fall right over. Not that big of a deal - all I needed to to was either to widen the area that the tripod legs stood upon, or re-orient the legs to compensate for the off-balance nature of the setup.I opted fort he latter and it works like a charm. If my camera were heavier, it could be an issue.. so be forewarned."
5,The Pod Rules!,"I took my Gorillapod with me on three trips, and found it to be indispensable. I was able to get myself in the picture in all kinds of places - I mounted it on a chain link fence, on a tree branch, on the deck of my kayak (securing it by hooking it to the deck lines), and on all manner of surfaces. It's compact and light, so it's easy to carry in a pocket, and therefore always available. It's a great little product at a low price. I love it."
4,Lighweight useful tripod,"I purchased the Joby GP1 for vacations out of the country with my wife. Most of our photos are of either one of us, but not both in the scene. It seems we are always looking for someone to ask to take a picture of the both of us together, but you never know their camera skills, or if they will just walk off with it ( I have a friend who had that happen to him). This handy little gadget is really light weight and compact. It can be placed on uneven surfaces or, as advertised, wrapped around small branches or poles etc.I purchased the Quick release replacement clips also, because I was unaware that a quick release clip came with the tripod. They only cost around $5 for a pair from Amazon. I only have one camera, and I didn't need the two extra quick release clips. So, I mailed them back for a refund. What a dumb thing that was, since the mailing fee was $5, Amazon got the clips back and I was still out the $5, duh!!!"
5,Very useful,This tripod is excellent for amature and professional photographers alike. Makes an excellent companion on international trips and video blogging. I have used this product to get some really wonderful shots.
3,Not what I paid for,"allaboutcellphones was the seller I bought this gorillapod from. The product wasn't in retail packaging, which lead me to believe that it was not new as described. The gpod was flimsy and the sockets kept popping out at several sections of the gpod. I asked for a refund/retrn, but they told me to keep it and they'd still credit me. win/win for me. Instead of its intended use, I now only use this to support my ipod touch 2g when i'm watching netflix or youtube vids on the road. BTW, I was going to use the gpod for my zoom h1 handy recorder. I wanted to hide the zoom h1 at weddings closer to the action, while I chilled out back and shot video. I won't trust a faulty product to hold onto my zoom. Next time I buy a gpod, it'll be a step up so it'll be a bit bigger & stronger."
5,Great compact tripod,I purchased this for my small handheld camcorder and it works great. I love that it can be used as a conventional tripod or wrapped around an item or propped up. Good price.
4,Nice and handy,Small enough to put into my pocket! But I put it in my bag together with the compact camera. Just the right size for my Panasonic TZ7 with nice colors.
5,COULD NOT LIVE WITHOUT IT!,If You take Photos this Item is Invaluable and You Will use It all the Time. It Grabs onto anything Enabling You To Take Steady as a Rock Photos and Get in a Group/Couple Photo instead of always having to ask a Stranger to Take a Photo for You! I Have Used this to take Many beautiful Shots in Low Light including Many of the Moon Coming Up Over the Ocean with great results. The GorillaPod is Constructed of Good Materials and Very well Made. It Does everything Advertised. I expect it to Last a Lifetime and this would be a Wonderful Gift to Anyone who takes Photos! It won't be a Gadget someone will Throw Into a Drawer and never use.
1,broke on second day,the gorilla pod tho a good idea was probably made in china and had the hallmark of poor quality in manufacturing.one of the legs snapped tho no undue stress had been placed on it as i tried to position a small sony camera.very disappointed.
1,From Gorilla to monkey business,"Reading reviews about this pod one would belief that it beats all other related camera steadeing hardware is junk. Well, it is the other way around! I got this gadget for nacro purposes however, the Gorilla Focus will not support my Canon 5D with a 100 mm lness and the Canon rig lite although the entire rig is well within the published support ratings. This Gorrilla pod become a nini monkey pod and collapses very slowly under the above mentioned weight this making it impossible to shoot a tack sharp image with. Getting this thing to wrap around anything and expect it to stay put loabgenough to get jusst one shot is a pipe dream unless I am doing something wrong.(Can not image what)making a long story short, it, the Gorrila pod goes back to the jungle and that goes for the Joby ball head as well. This is a lesson for me! Now I am hoping I can get my investment back."
3,only can use this product for point-and-shoot camera,"i purchased this gorillapod to use with my canon digital camera.unfortunately it is too small for that application.i thought it was larger and more suitable for a heavy camera.i then tried to use it as a tripod for my cell phone but apparently i need an adaptor/attachment.so, i am now the owner of something i can't use."
4,the pod is cool,"I love the idea of the little green gorillapod. I like the size vs. a standard tripod. It works pretty well, though it is not as stable as I would have hoped. As an alternative to carrying a typical tripod for certain situations it is very cool & worth owning."
3,Good for small cameras,I bought it thinking it would hold my SLR and boy was I wrong! It's great for compact digitals but is not strong enough to hold anything big. Oh well.
2,When height isn't important,"If you just need a tripod to level and steady your camera for a hands-off shot, this will do the trick. However, it seems to be very cheaply made for the price."
5,Great Product,"I was initially a little reserved about sticking a $500 piece of equipment upon a flexible tripod and hanging it off some precarious perch. I'm interested in getting a good picture, but not in endangering a gold mine.Fears were unfounded with the gorillapod. Secure fit and a big hit with friends. More stable and secure than one would think.And being priced competitively with other traditional mini-tripods, the gorillapod is a good bet. Very pleased."
4,Pricey but Nice,"The product is as multi use and flexible as advertised. At +20$ the price is a bit steep for what you are getting but if you order it, you'll be happy with the product."
3,Just OK,"This is a lot floppier than I expected it to be. I've tried using it with my little digital camera, and unless it's positioned perfectly upright it will not stay in place. It would never work for me to try the position in the picture, where the legs are wrapped around a pole and the camera is off to the side. My camera is not too heavy, either. Who knows, maybe I got a defective one."
5,Love it!,"Bought this by the beginning of April, and i absolutely love it! Brilliant design.. Get one if you don't already have one! Wraps around, hooks and fits to almost anything you'd need to fixate your camera to.Shipped fast and I definately recommend it!"
4,In theory,"In theory it worked pretty well. Took some practice shots at odd angles and the gorillapod kept the weight of my Sony DSC camera well. In fact, it works as advertised having no issues with the universal screw, camera weight, or adjustable arms. I just didn't use it as much as I thought I would on vacation since it does require you to setup shots."
4,"Works great, but don't expect it to work on everything","As long as you have a pocket-sized digital camera, this will do fine. It's really small, I don't think I'd trust it with even a larger-size point and shoot, like the Canon A series cameras.But it works fine. The little quick-release mount is nice, and easy to use. Obviously works great as a simple table-top tripod, but it's best for un-even surfaces. I thought the legs grabbed pretty well, could easily mount it to the top of a steering wheel and have it hold steady."
4,GOOD BUT A LITTLE BIG,It works well as a tripod and the idea of being able to hold on to anything is great. It doesn't slip out of shape. But I could see that they didn't need to make this item too big. This tripod is about the size of most point and shoot which seems to limit its portability. I added a strap to mines so it can hang outside making it easier to reach and not take up any space.
4,I like it,"I really like the size and the flexibility of this tripod. My digital camera is a perfect fit, and I really like how you can wrap it around an object for assistance to take pictures. I only wish that it came with a bag for cover when carrying in my purse."
5,Great gadget for using self-timers on cameras,"If you want to be in the picture using the timer and don't have that perfect stable place to place the camera on, then this gadget will come to your rescue. It wraps around just about anything, and you can easily screw it into the bottom of your camera where there is threading for a tripod. Never be left out of a picture again! : )"
3,It's ok,This came in a size smaller than i expected. Almost too small for a point-n-shoot camera. But I guess that makes it more portable. Other than that the quality of it is pretty good. The price maybe a little high tho.
3,Not as I expected..,"It is ok, but it can not stand any where as it said, and diffecult to hang any where."
3,Not really a tripod,"Well, it does have three legs, so technically it IS a tripod, but it doesn't work like one.First of all, I'm using my Canon S90 (very small point & shoot) so the weight isn't the issue.Here's the problem; when the camera is firmly attached, the small force of pressing the camera button is enough to move the camera just enough to wreck a long exposure photo (10 second exposure, for example). This fact makes this tripod unusable for long exposures (which is what I use tripods for). If you're using the tripod to take pictures of yourself and your sweetie with the camera hanging in a tree (instead of holding the camera at arm's length) then you're in luck.I have a small Manfrotto tripod that doesn't flex when pressing the shutter, so I guess I'll keep using that.Having said this, the Gorillapod is still pretty cool. Well made and flexible. I'm sure I'll find a use for it, but it isn't a real tripod replacement for me."
3,Versatile but broke after a few months use,I've used this along with Studio Neat's Glif to attach my iPhone 4s to my bike. The setup is sturdy and I had great results. But the Gorillapod did break after a few months of use. One the of joints fell apart. I could have had a defective unit. I bought a replacement and have not had any issues after 6 months of use.
5,Great little item!,Nearly unlimited ways to use this tripod. Very handy for timer photos and videos. Small size makes it easy to carry along.
3,It depends on your camera!!!,"This is one of those products where I said, ""Why didn't I think of that??"" It truly is a great invention, and the flexibility of the legs should not ever wear out, since there is no elastic type material that would stretch out- it is many small moving pieces that snap together that make up this tripod.IT DEPENDS ON YOUR CAMERA- if the mount on your camera is on the far end (most are), this makes the camera very unbalanced when you're using this light flexible tripod. If you are using a Canon ELPH 110, its perfect (which is what I bought the tripod for). But when trying this tripod with my Panasonic Lumix (which is a heavier point and shoot), it took some manipulating to get it the camera level. So, if you have a heavier point and shoot, it should still work if you have the patience. But I only recommend this product for a light point and shoot."
5,Satisfied,Handiest tripod I've ever had. When there's no good spot to set your camera or conventional tripod this little guy comes to the rescue. Handy for video recording lectures too
5,A Great Little Product!,Why didn't somebody think of this before? It's a great product and gives you a lot more flexibility with your camera. Recommended!
3,"neato, but breaks","what a wonderful idea! loved it, but after a few uses the ball joints started to crack!!! causing the legs to come apart :("
5,AMAZING,"I USE THIS FOR ANGEL CARE MONITOR VIDEO, SOUND, AND MOTION (MAKING SURE SHE'S BREATHING OK) PERFECT TRIPOD FOR THE PERFECT MONITORHIGHLY RECOMMEND BOTH!!"
5,Great for people who like to go everywhere,"So I got this today and I am IN LOVE WITH IT!!! It works GREAT!! I've taken several pictures and it really is amazing because even though it's only 5 inches I can choose how high, or low, I want my picture taken. And it really is convenient because it really will attach almost anywhere and I'm not afraid of it letting my camera go!! I'd recommend this to anyone with a small camera (I do believe you'll need a bigger one for bigger cameras to be on the safe size) I have a Canon Powershot SX230 which is PERFECT for bigger cameras, get the 10 inch one!! GOOD LUCK and happy picture taking!!"
3,"A quality, interesting product, but impractical","Build quality is good and it's easily flexible and stays in place. However, because of the stand's nature it is a pain to set up for use as a traditional flat-surface tripod. Also, it's smaller than expected and wasn't too cheap. Overall I'd recommend it but it feels like something is missing."
5,Camera Bug,Very handy item for anyone who likes to take pictures. I have both the large size and this small tripod that conveniently fits into a purse for traveling. I have also given the tripod as gifts to others who enjoy taking pictures.
4,Grabs anything...and holds on. :-),"So far, this has been a great little ""tripod""...if you want to stick a name to it. Its actually a LOT better than a tripod. While it can function as one very well, it can also be used to hang your camera from a tree limb, a stair rail, or just about anything you can wrap its legs around (even your wrist). I've got a small point and shoot Canon camera and it works GREAT with that camera. However, anything much bigger than that type of camera and I'd be afraid that the weight might tend to pull the ""legs"" loose from whatever you've got it attached to. It does take some getting used to but its fun figuring out different ways to use it and it seems to be holding up really well."
5,Purchase of CD thru Amazon,Very good music and very good service - this is the 2nd time I have been asked to give a review for this item.
1,any book but this one if you have an auto claim,"If you have a property ins claim, this book might help, but itgave no advice on how to get anything if you had an Auto Claim.It was disappointing."
1,Please Dont Buy,If you use your xbox for excessive amount of time the plastic can melt inside your xbox. Not good.
3,its ok,"For the price and the size of the bag, it is pretty good. I am currently in the Navy and I ordered this while overseas on deployment. It survived being packed to its brim with clothes and other items I needed to carry with me when we pulled into port and I wanted to do laundry. My only complaint is the velco handle tore very easily because of the low quality stitching. This may be to how much I packed things into it. Oh and the side pockets don't expand and are kind of shallow. Other than that, pretty good bag"
3,Above average debate about God,"Two English heavyweights sqaure off in the ring to debate that age old question of God's existence. Flew throughout dodges the argument which Meithe presents: the analogy of being. All Flew really does, Meithe catches him on it: ""Flew has simply made a statement here."" pg. 162. Flew's continuing discussion about the many different notions of God is irrelevant to this debate as Meithe scolds him. Typical is the irritation that continues in never truly debating what Meithe puts forward, i.e. that God is the ""merciful Creator and Sustainer of all that exists."" Fascinating appendices by Ayer, Swinburne and Kung. A good read!"
2,Get what you pay for,"This cd is not as funny as his other ones. I recommend ""Greatest Hits"" with many of his more famous stories about marcel ledbetter, coon hunting,etc."
4,Some very funny stuff (and some filler),"I agree with the reviewer who says that this is not as funny as ""Greatest Hits."" That said, however, there is some very funny stuff here that is NOT on ""Greatest Hits."" Buy this one at the bargain basement price and transfer the gems to your own ""greatest hits"" tape or CD. The sound quality on ""Clower Power"" is fine and some of the material is absolutely hilarious."
4,Jerry =Funny,"This was Jerry's best ever. I could not stop laughing through out the album. His ""backwoods"" tales remind me of my grandfather's stories of the rural south. I highly recommend this work!"
3,Brief and abstract!,The book is very brief and abstract. It only presents the main concepts and theorems without much explanation. It lacks examples and practice exercises.It is a good source of basic theory but it should be complemented with some exercises so as to be able to fully understand the concepts.The book binding is excellent.
5,excellent book for designers,"this book is cool - lots of pictures, the text is brief. there is a good mix of concepts and production products ( concepts are always more fun to look at and have more pure ideas. production parts show how it all works in the real world). in fact, the best part of the book is that it finds positive things about a lot of products. it isn't demanding that we stop using plastic or batteries - just finds the best examples of products that use them wisely.One important section is buried in the back. pages 327 - 330 give eco-design strategies. the are brief desicriptions of how to design an ""eco"" product. for example, one says ""self-assembly: designs that are assembled by the consumer, therefore saving valuable space in transport and storage"". most writers would take several pages to say the same thing."
3,Why tease us?,"Music videos are short little dramatic pieces. You would think that consumers would be at least worthy of 45 minutes to an hour of videos from the 80's. Call me harsh but I consider this DVD a waste of time. I bought it because I love most everything 80's but it's so short once I get into it it's time to go back to the main menu or put in something new. I really, really would love to own a 2-3 compilation of 80's videos. This is it. I would say this one is for a fan of one of the artists included who wants to have their favorite video on DVD. The Bananrama video for Venus is a fun video with the girls dancing around. Brass In Pocket is classic--Chrissy Hynde as a singing waitress. I mean it's an okay assorment but very brief and bare bones..."
3,"skimpy track selection, otherwise okay","I don't know what's up with Rhino. They released a handful of these ""Essential Music Video"" titles but each disc contains only five or six videos, total running time around 20-25 minutes. It's nice that each disc is priced (somewhat) accordingly, but it is just such a waste of physical resources (all that plastic) and space for the consumer. It would have made more sense for them to have at least put 10 videos (if not double that) on each disc and then charge twice as much.As to the videos on this particular disc itself, there are some good ones. I think that Bananaram's ""Venus"" nearly qualifies as a camp classic from the era. Simply Red's ""Holding Back The Years"" still shines. Even though I'm a big Howard Jones fan, I wish they would have chosen one of his other videos for inclusion here.Sound and picture quality is okay, but it's stereo only (no multichannel remix here)."
3,Classic '80s Videos,"Like a lot of these compilation DVDs, you pretty much have to settle for what you can get. So out of the 6 videos presented here, I got 3 that I really wanted. Bananarama's ""Venus"" was one of them. And although the girls' dancing style looks a little silly and outdated, it's still a great song. The Pretenders' ""Brass In Pocket"" is kind of a nostalgic favorite of mine because it was one of the first videos I remember seeing on MTV. ""Chains of Love"" is the final pick of my three. There's nothing bad I can say about the other 3 videos. It's just nice to be able to see ANY of these videos the way we used to be able to see them every day on MTV. The picture quality and sound are very good, as you would expect on a DVD. By all means, buy this one."
5,A WORK OF ART,"Its an incredible LCD, Super HD IMAGING, an the ambilight its a Blast!!I fully recomend it!!Thanks Philips for this amazing viewing experience!!"
3,"When it works, it's a nice TV","Less than a week after buying this TV in July 2007, it stopped working. The power light would come on briefly and then it would shut off. We returned it to the store and got a replacement.Fast forward to today, Nov. 23, 2008. The ""new"" TV did the same thing, after having worked with no problems earlier in the day. Called Philips and they're covering the repair even though it's out of warranty, but it's still a major annoyance for such a big ticket item."
5,EXCELLENT HD TV,"This is a great product. The ambilight feature is great. I was simply blown out by the picture quality of this unit. Made a lot of research at CNet and other sites and everywhere I found good reviews about this product. Currently I do not have an upconverting DVD player, using a SONY progressive scan single-DVD player, but still the performance is amazing."
2,The Invincible Six,"Shot in Persia (Iran) with an international cast, with a straightforward plot descended from ""The Magnificent Seven"" which in turn was borrowed from ""The Seven Samuri,"" with touches of Mission Impossible. An Oater on Landrovers. Stuart Whitman, Curt Jurgens, Elke Sommers, Ian Olgilvy, Behruze (the Iranian Movie Star)and Bob Mitchum, son of Robert Mitchum. Directed by Oscar winner Jean Negulesco, the cinematography is above average, with great shots of downtown Tehehran circa 1968 and breathless shots of the Royal Crown Jewels (the only shots in existance). Oater on Landrovers. Good guys rally to save town from desert bandit (and stinkaroo actor)Mitchum. Movie is redeemed by good turns (some comedic) by Olgilvy and Jurgens, a few good Iranian actors and some incredible Iranian scenery. Check out actual Iranian villages and the ancient palace of Persepolis."
1,a stinker,"I should not have bought it,as it should have remained a fantasy living in my memory. The acting is attrocious,the story is weak,the effects and sound well,never mind, better say nothing than be nasty."
4,Wonderful Read,"My son and I have loved this book from almost the moment we started. This is a survival story, in essence. Two young teens become marooned in the high Rockies for a winter. The Native American boy has to remember all the old ways of making weapons and hunting so they can survive to hike out in the spring. The methods explained represent authentic practices used by stone-age natives. The plot contains plenty of excitement. Fun for ten to fifteen year olds, as well as those of us who love stories of the old days."
4,Good read,"I like historical books about the Native Americans and living in the area where much of this occurred increases that interest. Good, easy read."
5,Film Noir - Angel Voice! Carly Simon IS the gift!,"In this disc, Carly sings ""Two Sleepy People"" (a duet with John Travolta). I heard this same song with James Taylor and I must say that Carly's interpretation is ""THE SHOW"". Another song I love in this disc is ""Laura"" - what a beautiful melody. I was curious about ""Lili Marlene""; after Marlene Dietrich made it famous, it's a dangerous selection for another singer. But Carly is CARLY and she gives a gorgeous interpretation to this old song. ""Last Night When We Were Young"" and ""Evr'ry Time We Say Goodbye"" are to die for. Great Carly, as always!"
5,Carly in black and white,"I first saw this album on a tribute to film noirs on the Bravo network years ago in high school. I eventually sought it out and have never regretted the purchase. I even lent it to a friend who enjoyed it as well. Carly's vocals are rich and beautiful and fit the mood of the noir genre perfectly. Stand-out tracks include ""Last Night When We Were Young"", ""Laura"" and the absolutely touching ""Spring Will Be a Little Late This Year"". The only truly uninspired track would be ""Two Sleepy People"" which is a poorly-done duet with John Travolta who I'm not fond of, but that's another story. Film Noir is a must buy for any fan of the genre and would also be a good choice for a Carly Simon fan's collection."
5,Spring,"We enjoyed all of the songs but the best one was ""Spring will be a little late this year."" We received Moonlight Seranade a couple of day ago and are enjoying tha very much also."
3,Good Stuff,"A friend of mine actually gave this CD to me some time ago. He didn't like it too much. Actually listened to it for the first time just days ago. Quite good. Latin freestyle is definitely in. Coincidentally, a friend of mine has a song on this CD. Favorites were Artie, Latin Nation, Legit, Willie Valentin and Marilyn Sanchez.Good stuff."
4,original y esquisito!!,"musica distinta a lo acostumbrado, muy subterraneo y detallista en los sonidos que desean uno persiba!!"
2,Where y'at?,"While I found the write-up about the history of buildings and places in and around New Orleans pleasant and informative, I thought the list of places to stay, visit, and dine was woefully lacking.I have lived in New Orleans for eleven years. Many of the hotels in the heart of the city weren't listed. Only a few restaurantsthat weren't over-priced tourist magnets made the list.Maps were accurate and helpful. Only minor difficulty following some directions.If you don't mind being directed to the places that most visitors are shuttled to, this is the book.If you want to experience New Orleans' real food and culture, and venture off the beaten (tourist) path, find another book."
4,Well used,"I used this almost every day of my 1 week trip. As is with all ET guides, if they marked hotels and restaurants on their maps, it would be much more user friendly instead of having to rely on Yelp and/or mobile phones. Also would've been nice if they had a section on the 9th ward or at least just labeled it on their map.There's also a small section on Baton Rouge and surrounding areas. Would've been nice to know as then I wouldn't have bought another book just for that purpose."
2,Art collector,"I ordered a subscription to Art Collector because I'd seen the mag in galleries and wanted to use it as a gallery and artist reference guide. However, Art Colllecter magazine covers a very limited scope of catagories of art. I was looking for info on modern, contemporary and new artists and galleries - although the mag is beautiful, the art that's covered is beautiful but it's info and news is limited to nautical, midwestern and realistic themes. I had hoped to see more progressive work included in the publication."
5,Great Magazine,If you love fine art you have to get this magazine. it shows what is going on in the art world with all the great artists. I don't think I will ever be able to throw an issue away.
4,good inspiration,"I use all magazines for inspiration for my own textile art. I do mainly portraits, but I like seeing how other artists use color, detail and theme. So far, American Art Collector has provided the best inspiration of any magazine I have tried."
5,"Boss is ""Boss""","OK... I am a pro musician & rely on gear that will stand the tests of the road. I was using an old Ibenez Chorus Pedal (one of the first to hit the market) of which I did not use much basically due to it's used for certain songs. I upgraded from using 2 separate pedal boards to a single unit & decided to buy the Boss CH-1 Super Chorus to add to the collection. After my first gig I removed the Ibenez Chorus Pedal because of the tonal superiority of the Boss unit. I am certain there are units that may boast of being better but, I have found through my 40+ years of playing that more money is not always better.Great tones! Easy operation! And it is the best bet for the money!"
4,Best in it's price range,This is a solid pedal that puts out a great sound. There isn't that swirl you get when you stop playing which happens with a lot of cheap chorus pedals.
5,Great Accessory,I work on the stage a great deal and I have found over the years this is a wonderful voice enhancer.I'm about to try to do some Beach boys numbers on my own with this piece of equipment.
5,Sadharma Pundarika 'discurse of the fine law',"Must comentaries of the sutras or Buddhist canonical scriptures are technical or popular, too dry or too soft. This one is either. Aim at a lay audience the 9 chapters or so go through 7 of the main stories paraboles and myths of this sutra. The Sadharma Pundarika has geven birth to schools of Buddhism, works of Art, and endless comentaries. No wonder why,In the suttra we find the Buddha at it's most grand, the Dharma at it's deepest.... the Sangha should just read it. This books helps to wet one's appetite for it."
5,Fast paced,I love this Cd. Play just about every day at work and start Jigging while sitting in my chair. It is worthwhile to buy for family gifts or self.
4,Another hit by Strieber,"I am only about 3/4 of the way through with this book, but am enjoying it. At times it seems very different from what I imagine the history of abductions to be like, but the it is fiction. It's a good book and well worth the time to read."
5,Blast from the past!,"I grew up in the 60's and 70's with the music of Tommy James & The Shondells. Back then the music and titles sounded so professional and well thought out. Watching Tommy in this video describe in minute detail how some of the songs and titles came to be used was so interesting. The songs have stood the test of time - hearing them on the radio now just brings a smile to my face as it was when I was in my teens. The concert video was great - good sound and camera work. Anyone who loved this music should get this video, sit back, and just let the music flow."
2,Save Your Money...,"The spoken word portion (""affirmations"") is uninspiring and sounds tedious and boring. Annoying even. Listen instead to recorded crickets, rain or a spring pond with frogs if you want to be lulled to sleep. No ""story,"" narrative in the affirmations. The entertainment or enlightenment quotient value of this tape is very low. A guided meditation such as those by Emmett Miller much to be preferred. Cannot agree with the other reviewer who rates this highly."
2,Didn't Sway Me,"Obviously this film was made to make people feel sympathy for the subjects. It was interesting to watch, but I don't feel any pity for these men. They were rescued by the US, given a once-in-a-lifetime shot at a great life, and they all just pissed it away. They admit that they never bothered becoming citizens. It just wasn't important to them. They break our laws, and then they are outraged when they are booted. If only we can exile all our criminals! One of them was especially obnoxious: Kim Ho Ma, a shiftless, wannabe gangsta. After being deported, he was lucky enough to land in a halfway house that gave him free room and board. All he did there was smoke, listen to rap, and play cards. How about helping out the old man mopping the floor at the very least? I could only roll my eyes as he preened and complained that he didn't fit in because he was raised in America. At the very end, all he had to say was F this and F that and F America. Good riddance."
3,A documentary that needed to be made but could have been done better.,"I watched this film because I was curious how my friend Kim was doing after being deported. So there's my bias, up front. That said, I'm glad someone made a documentary about this issue that is severely disrupting the Cambodian-American community, but the issue is not presented with adequate context. There is minimal treatment of the geopolitical and historical circumstances that have lead up to the forced deportation of men who screwed up as kids. I also dislike the fact that the last time Kim's voice is heard, it's him obviously intoxicated and extremely upset venting at the camera. I wonder how much input these men had regarding the way their stories were presented, because some of the editing choices seem exploitative to achieve maximum drama, not to address the issue with the detail and sensitivity it deserves."
5,I couldn't put this down,"While in college, I had to do a paper on ""On The Road"" and after reading it, I became absolutely fascinated with Jack Kerouac. I got this book out of the library one day. I think it is excellent. It documents Kerouac's whole life from birth to death and gives the reader a wonderul insight into the ""real"" Jack Kerouac. I literally could not put this down."
2,Kerouac Bum,"Although Kerouac was quite an interesting character, Charters gives little justice to this literary genius. She gives merely a string of events, adding no story to his life at all. In addition to that, Mrs. Charters does not describe some situations at all. The reader is left to wonder what truly happened in some instances, and this gives little justice to Jack's life. There were a few sentences were the author attempted to write in Jack's style, and fails miserably. I'm sorry to detract so much from Mrs. Charters, but she is no Jack Kerouac. Overall, the book isn't bad, and if you're really interested in Kerouac, it's not a bad place to start, but if you really want to dive into Kerouac's psyche and true genius, this is not the place to do it."
5,rare find,"This CD is excellent, it really delivers a clear message while rocking. I would recommend this to anyone who likes real sounding rock. Also a must have for disciple fans."
4,Oldz Kool,"As a HUGE Disciple fan, I can tell you that this is a great CD but is very different from their most recent efforts like RISE UP & SCARS REMAIN. It sounds more like old school metal (which I love!!). If you put old Metallica & Rage Against the Machine in a blender, you would have ""THIS MIGHT STING A LITTLE"". In your face Chritian lyrics and heavy guitar work make this a must have in your Disciple collection."
3,Gets the job done,Great for arm workouts. Only complaint is the feel of the handles. They could be built of a more solid plastic/material. The red spindal clicks with every rep so unsure if it will break anytime soon.
5,good workout for seniors,"I bought this product to set up a ""workout station"" on my front porch and it has worked quite well. A patio swing on the porch is my favorite place to sit so I wrapped the cable on the crossbar leaving enough down cable and handles to pull down on. I am thinking of getting another cable to use indoors on the floor mat."
1,Band broke the first day,I may have just gotten a defective product but it was supposed to be brand new from amazon. I like the product and the resistance was good at first. The second set of overhead tricep ext. with one band attached and it snapped right at the base of the handle. Im going to send it back.
4,Good strong and durable,I bought this for my lady now that she is constantly working out trying to get rid of that baby weight. She needed something she could do at the house while watching the baby not being able to always make it to the gym. I was under the impression cable resistance was a girly workout and was actually suprised when I used it and got a good burn and more than enough resistace is provided with adjustable bands.
2,not a big fan of the bands,"This is probably common to all bands, but I hadn't thought of it before I bought this. The hard plastic handle pushes into your arm quite a bit for a number of the exercises. This resulted in noticeable bruises on my forearm after using this.The other problem is that this band is a little short for me. You're not supposed to stretch it beyond 3x its unstretched length. I'm 6' tall and to do several of the exercises in the pamphlet, I would need to stretch it 4x or longer. This is probably a better length for someone that's around 5'7""."
1,Wrong advertising,"Looking through previous customer reviews, I realised that most of them faced the same problem I did, that is, the TNT Cables that were advertised on Amazon were for 3 x R4 (40 pound) cables, but the set that is sold by Amazon contains 3 x R3 cables (30pound), 2 x handles, 1 x door attachment, 1 x poster (of exercises) and no instructional DVD.I returned the item, and Amazon customer service was top notch (as usual). Someone should really:1. review the advertising on the page for the TNT cables, or2. make sure that the products that they send out match the descriptions on the website."
5,Great all around exercise gadget!,Im very satisfied with this item. You can do many variations and positions to use when you need to exercise. Another plus is you don't need big space to store it when not being used. Highly recommended!
1,Bad bands,These have to be the worst bands I've ever owned. I thought I would try these out for extra resistance for my p90x workout and boy do these things hurt when you use them. They do have pretty good resistance but they hurt my hands so bad because they rub hard against your hands to the point it left rub marks and the cheap plastic handles are so uncomfortable. I immediately boxed them up and shipped them back after using them 1 time. I have been using the GoFit bands for the last 6 months and they have been great but they only go up to 30lbs resistance and that's why I was shopping around for more resistance. I guess I will keep looking.
2,this product is trash,"The TNT Bands are no good. The bands will snap because of the plastic thing in the tube, it puts a strain on the tube causing it to pop. Just buy the bands from bodylastics. Much better product. The TNT bands are trash ""DONT GET THEM"""
3,Description not entirely accurate,"One of the product features is:""System's three 5-foot cables create roughly 40 pounds of resistance""I thought from that description that I would be getting three 5 foot cables with 40lb tension (R4 cable). However, it seems like it's the 30lb tension cable (R3) and for some reason it's short by about half a foot. I have an R3 cable and the color's pretty similar, and the tubing looks exactly the same besides being shorter. I thought the R4 cable would be thicker and a darker magenta-like color based on pictures and what I saw at the store (same brand). I'm disappointed that it's not the R4, because it seems like that's what the description said. I can get this same item with R3's at the store for cheaper, and I'll probably return the one I ordered since the store pack comes with a DVD too. I'm sure this product works just as well, the description's just a little misleading."
5,Best band ever.,You won't regret your purchase. I looked all over before buying these and they are great. Use the for P90X and the are perfect.
4,"It's rubber tubing with handles, and it works.","The TNT cables make for a very effective replacement of a free-weight set. With a little creativity, you can work almost all of your major muscle groups. The set of three(3) 20lb cables were plenty to get me started on exercises like curls, military press, squats, and incline press. I also do some decline press by looping the cables over my Iron Gym bars in the door jam. Like I said, you can get creative with these, and there's always the option to upgrade to ""heavier"" cables."
5,What a difference!,"Just got a chance to listen to some of this album and I must say it sounds wonderful. For years I've been dying for remastered versions of some of my favorite songs by BSF and this album does a great job with that. Only got to listen to a couple of tracks, but Vehicle (my favorite BSF song) sounds so much better, it's unbelievable. Most of the other songs sound great too, but I just couldn't stop listening to Vehicle.Definately going to pick this up in the very near future, and if you're even remotely in to old stuff by Boy Sets Fire, I suggest you do the same. Only disappointment that I saw is that the song Swingset isn't on this album, which kind of hurts, but the original version doesn't sound as muddy as some of the other unmastered songs. Overall great songs and such a difference in clarity."
1,Promises you can't keep,I believe it is a good book to learn Photoshop tricks very fast. The fact that Silver Pixel Press promises you an electronic image to do the exercises in the book and does not keep up with their word is irresponsible and frustrating. It is the first time I see that a publisher does not keep their end of the bargain. I am going to think twice next time I purchase a book from this publishing house.
2,false advertising,"DUB? I don't get it. is this a joke? There was supposed to be some dub influence here. maybe i'm a little immature in my musical tastes, maybe i expect too much out of my music, or maybe this album is just a lot of hype- because it sounds like white-bread-psuedo-soul with a little too much country thrown in not to mention that whiny wannabe steely dan/jazz guitar . The first track and one more are decent feel good music, but if you are expecting the slow-burn promise on the label to be fulfilled, i don't see it happening. this guy's voice is fine on the first 3 or 4 tracks, but then he picks up this cheesy, whiny, country drawl that made me hit the stop button immediately. sorry, but listen before you buy, or be prepared to give this one to your 50 year old parents."
4,"Eclectic mix of roots country-reggae, folk","Don't miss this eclectic album from Jeb Loy Nichols.It's an eclectic mix of styles, ranging from soul grooves, to country/folk to a touch of reggae. Check out ""Heaven Right Here"" to see what I mean.A very original album from a very talented artist."
4,melloooow,"i'm a recent immigrant to the nashville area, but have fallen in love with a local radio station down there (100.1 wrlt). they play jeb loy nichols all the time.he's got the melancholy alt-pop down. i love the cd!"
3,Save Tonight?,"Nichols seems to be channeling Eagle Eye Cherry; no one seems to have mentioned the latter's lack of success. This is not to say that Nichol's brand of pop funk is awful, but the failure of similar artists seems to be indicative of the disinterest of the market. Pleasant enough in small doses, a whole album's worth grates, perhaps it would be better to wait for the inevitable repackage, although I doubt Nichols has enough material to generate a `Best Of'"
2,Disappointment,"I'm amazed that this album has such high stars here.Bought back then when it had just come out. What a disappointment it was(I recall only couple of other albums I*ve ordered which have left me pondering as much to what did I end up getting ).The song Say Goodbye to Christopher is just a brilliant track. That one is truly worth 4-5 stars but to me almost all the other tracks are real shallow in comparison (1-2 others I can listen without getting the chills). To me things get too sweet without no rough corners to it. And I really like real emotional stuff, but there needs to be some brilliance to it. Here's a lot of corny lines packed next to each other... Not my cup of tea..."
2,Fogs up ... ???!!!,"Out of the box, this mirror fogs up every time I use it. I assume that something must be blocking the little copper pipe inside. Sometime soon I will remove it and take a look to see if it can be fixed. If not, it's going right back to Amazon.Update 5/13/2008 - After moving and reinstalling this mirror in my new shower, I noticed a little tube inside the connector that must have been blocked when I first installed it. I unbent the tube, installed it, and it works GREAT! My rating changes from two stars to 5! Just be sure to clean it often ... small water spots can occur if it's not consistently maintained. (Everything needs to be maintained, though, doesn't it?)"
4,Good quality but expensive,"If it weren't so expensive, it would've gotten 5 stars.Works as advertised. Probably pays for itself over years since you don't have to keep buying $15 dollar mirrors that scratch when you wipe them down.Reversible feature is great. I use just one side and turn it around when done. That way the side I use stays clean without water spots.Easy to install. Very sturdy."
2,4 foot Gardman Bamboo Canes,"I was disappointed when I opened these, I had also ordered the 5 foot ones and they appear that they will do quite well in holding up my tall plants. There are 25 4 foot stakes in this package and it looks like I will only be able to use about half of them. Half of the stalks are so thin that they I don't believe they will hold up my plants. I am not going to return them because the next package might have even more in it that I can not use, so I guess I will have to settle for about 12 that I can use."
1,my opinion,This battery is cheaper--but you get what you pay for here!! I must charge it before use if it has been --just a few hours between uses....this is a hassle and I no longer use this battery I threw them away--YEA I BOUGHT TWO!
1,Cannot be obtained,"I had the same experience as another user: unusable (for me) variant 7000C was sent instead of 7000B by different vendors. However, 7000B is still advertised."
2,Some problems,"the fan didn't initially work, but Zalman replaced it, but it is not a trivial installation. Haven't had time to install the new one yet."
2,Definitely NOT her best...,"Wow... I love Dusty, but this was a big disappointment. Rather than showing the singer ""at the height of her powers"" (as the liner notes say) I kept hunting for, searching for, and straining for just a glimpse of the voice that I had remembered from her work during the 1960s. Either the voice is already shot, or her sound engineer SHOULD be shot! Her opening notes on ""I Just Don't Know What To Do With Myself"" are so pitifully off key that they made me wince! Rather than finding Dusty ""in top form"" I think this concert captured her at a difficult time in her career, when she was searching for relevance as a singer, and was also searching for some good material. However, Dusty does LOOK good... Thankfully, about 7 years after this concert, the Pet Shop Boys rescued her and gave her the chance to reinvent herself as a singer and entertainer."
5,One of my favorite books,"I was recommended this book by a friend. I really didn't know what to expect and I was thrilled to find it a wonderful book. Instead of focusing on the horrors of war, Emaculee instead turns to God. If we could all have the courage and strenght she had! I would recommend this to everyone! In fact I ended up buying several copies and sending them to friends and family."
5,Tear Jerker,All I can say is you need to read and see the salvation of the Lord. Do you really know God's covering? Read this and then you tell me.
5,A Most Inspiring Book,"This is one of the most inspiring books I have ever read. Immaculee is a true witness to the power of faith. Her devastating account of the brutality and evil that was perpetrated on her tribe will leave you numb. This book should be read by everyone who allows the ""small"" things to bother them. Your life and view of the outside world will be changed forever. God bless Immaculee for her profound and powerful work."
5,Beyond Belief,How one young woman along with six others survived an impossible ordeal through faith in God gives hope to everyone! Immaculee is a humble hero. Could you live in a tiny locked bathroom for months? You will never stop asking yourself this question.Love for family and ultimate trust in God made Immaculee an overcomer!
3,Just my opinion....,"I didn't want to put the book down as I read how Immaculee and her people had to endure torture and much killing at the hands of another group, many of them neighbors and friends. She survived the ordeal through a series of miracles from God and came through with an amazing relationship with God.My purchasing experience wasn't so ""amazing"" - I chose to purchase a used book only to discover later than my book wasn't the same as everyone else's in my book club. Be careful when you ""used"" books."
3,Pretty Good...,"Pretty amazing story. A little too ""God"" focused for my liking. However, her message is clear. A moving story and a good read."
4,heartbreaking,"sometimes hard to read because ,how can humans do such terrible things to each other. Immaculee is an amazing woman."
5,The power of love,"Thank you Immaculee and Steve for blessing us with this profound story of determination, courage, and love. I could feel myself in that bathroom with Immaculee, absorbed in the mighty power of prayer as we fought off deadly thoughts and feelings of fear and rage while killers stalked us just inches away.I pray that the people who need to feel the healing power of forgiveness are drawn to this book. Immaculee's faith and determination are contagious! The pages of this book resonate with her invitation to receive the healing power of forgiveness."
4,Life-altering Book,"I bought this book for several friends after meeting and hearing Ms. Ilibagiza speak at a conference. The book is very straightforward, an extremely easy read. But the message of the power of faith and forgiveness in the face of unspeakable personal horrors is life altering. It absolutely purges your heart of any harbored animosities that may by poisoning your system over years. I would recommend it for old and young alike."
5,Great Book,"This is a great book to read. Very inspiring for anyone and everyone. I would strongly recommend it to everyone. I don't read books all that much, but took the time to read this one. It makes one truly understand the power of God."
5,Left to Tell,This is a life changing book. Anyone who is challenged with forgiveness must read this book. Imaculee is an amazing human being!!
5,excellent,"I am one who was in my oblivious mid-20's when this holocaust happened and I knew shamefully little about it at the time. This book gave me the opportunity to understand this significant historical event from the perspective of someone living it. Immaculee becomes your neighbor, your friend through her words - the retelling of her experience. Her witness to God's presence in her life during a horrific experience is both humbling and encouraging. I come away from this book educated about what happened in Rwanda in 1994, deeply moved by the story told, and more committed to understanding and working to change the suffering that plagues our world today."
5,Amazing Read,"This book is AMAZING. I litterally could not put it down, and finished it in 4 hours. The story told by Immaculee will bring you to tears as you contemplate the absolute horrors endured by the people of Rwanda. Despite all this, Immaculee tells the story without a trace of bitterness or resentment.Her story of courage and forgiveness is a lesson to us all, and an absoulte MUST READ."
5,Gave me back my hope,"As a survivor of the genocide of Rwanda, this book reminded me of my own ordeal during the genocide. At first I was angry with Immaculee when I read the summary of her book, how can she forgive? Then when I started reading the book, I understood, I couldn't put it down, I couldn't stop crying, so many feelings that I thought existed only during that time, came back, I felt a lot of thirst, my mouth dry as well, my heart beating very fast...however at the end of the book I felt that something great have happened to me, a HEALING. I felt an excitment to live and to dream again, to stop living in the past, it reminded me that we are all God's children and that there's always HOPE.Thank you Immaculee, God worked through you!"
5,"Moving, heart wrenching story","""Left to Tell"" is a gripping, moving story about one woman's survival story through the Rwanda genocide. What makes this book different than ""Hotel Rwanda"" and other similar books is that a major portion of the book is devoted to the author's time spent hiding in a bathroom, praying and meditating and coming closer to God. It is very similar to Victor Frankl's ""Man's Search for Meaning"". A very quick, influential read that I am sure you will appreciate. Highly recommended for all."
5,Left to tell by Immaculee Ilibagiza,I enjoyed the educational value of the book It is sad that man's inhumanity to man is still prevalent.I place this book in the catogory of Anne Frank's Diary. This proves that if you deny a tragedy it is destined to happen again.many people deny the Holocaust.This is the same thing.It also proves that predjudice is a human failing not particular to any one race. Interracial prejudice is just as deadly as predujice against one race from another.
4,Rwanda Remembered,"""Left to Tell"" brings to life the horrors of the Rwandan genocide in 1994. My readers' group was so moved and intrigued by the horrors the author endured that they have selected Ilibagiza'a sequel for the next meeting. America needs to be aware of some of the suffering in the rest of the world. Previously we read ""Secret Daughter"" which sheds light on some of the problems of the poor in India."
5,LEFT TO TELL,"An amazing story of survival,forgiveness,and God's infinite love. We can all learn from Immaculee. God soften the hearts of man, so we can love more like you."
5,Left to Tell,The real and extraordinary experience of Imaculee and her family are beyond the ability of human beings to cope with by themselves. Truly God was with her and held her thru the ordeal. And the most compelling aspect of it all God graced her thru the process of forgiveness.
4,LEFT to Tell,"LEFT to Tell was reader-friendly and inspirational. It shows you the power of the human mind, faith and a higher power."
4,Wonderful Encouragement...,This book is an excellent encouragement for anyone going through a major crisis. Immaculee shows us through her personal experiences that GOD is able to lift us out of the darkest pit. Thank you Immaculee for sharing your story of survival and faith in an all conquering God.
5,Inspiring Story!,"I borrowed this book from the public library and loved it so much that I bought a copy for our church library. This woman's story is incredible, so inspiring. Everyone would benefit from reading this book, it really touched my heart."
5,A must read,"A story of faith, tragedy, courage, survival and triumph. Immaculee Ilibagiza's riveting autobiographical story of living through the Rwandan holocaust is a story of her faith growing amidst the incomprehensible and shocking experience of genocide. The story of the Hutu tribe slaughtering the Tutsi tribe is the background for her moving story, a tale of primal fear held at bay by faith that grows in Immaculee. I was deeply moved."
5,Healing from the Holocaust,"In Left to Tell, Imaculée Ilibagiza tells her heart-wrenching memoir of the Rwandan Holocaust which she survived as a young woman by hiding in a nearby pastor's bathroom for 91 appalling days. This true story not only reveals the horrors of the Rwandan Holocaust and the violence and hatred that accompanied it, but it also illustrates Imaculée's fervent faith in God and her reliance on him to carry her through this time of political and social strife. With graphic descriptions, unshakeable faith, and brutal honesty, Imaculée tells her story of faith, forgiveness, and why a Holocaust is something history cannot afford to repeat."
2,How The Human Heart Prevails,"Left To Tell is a magnificent story of the human heart's struggle to overcome horrific suffering; to forgive those at the root cause of our suffering; and in the midst of it all, find the love, peace, and protection of God who truly holds us close with each step we take. I could not put this book down and literally finished it in two days. At this time in our world when there is so much suffering and many ask, And where is God, Immaculee's struggle, though deeply heart-wrenching, teaches us to never give up and to always rely on God's help. No one will walk away from reading this story unchanged - it will transform your heart from the inside out. I give it 20 Stars!!"
2,Left to Tell,"This book helped me to strenghten my belief in God. To have a stronger faith and hope. When we believe and we leave things in the hand of God, He will direct us on the right path"
2,My opinion,"I found this book to be tedious...Genocide is a horrific tragedy, however, Ms. Ilibagiza's awkward method of writing left me feeling empty. Perhaps she should stick to giving interviews and keep away from writing."
1,Left To Tell: Discovering God Amidst the Rwandan Holocaust,There is only one word to describe this book and it is BRILLIANT! If you would like a wonderful book to read I would advise you to read this book!Happy readingChar:)
5,Left to Tell,"A heartfelt story of young girl's survival of the genocide in Rwanda and how she relies on her faith to get her through. A wonderful read, filled with inspiration and a renewd appreciation for living in The United States of America."
5,Life Changing,This book is one of the best I have ever read. Opened my eyes to another culture and challenged my faith to replicate areas of faith demonstrated by someone half my age.
4,Excellent,I brought this book this book over my vacation. I thought that the book was very good. It helped to open my mind to what was happening around the world especially in Rwanda. I hope you like the book as much as I did.
5,Left to Tell,I bought for my daughter who is a teacher and she loved the book. Will share with her students
5,Left To Tell: Discovering God Amidst the Rwandan Holocaust,"Immaculee Ilibagiza tells a very heart touching story of her survival during a holocaust lasting 91 days. I felt inspired by her faith, and was spellbound by the dignity she gave to all, friend or foe."
5,Amazing!,"I loved this book! I learned about the genocide in Rwanda, as well as, I found Immaculée's story to be inspirational. Even though she was in a small bathroom with several women for such a long time, she rose above it by meditation and prayer. As a result of her relationship with God, she discovered her purpose in life. Immaculée truly soared above the suffering in Rwanda in many ways."
5,Left to Tell: Discovering God amidst the Rwandan Holocaust,"This book really reaches down into your very core. Immaculee tells her remarkable story about survival in a time of darkness and death. She finds her inner strength and communes freely with the world deep inside of her...her soul. She finds a way to bring the reader into her world and allows you to experience her deep sorrows and triumphant joys. Her courage through such adversity is remarkable! She is a living example of what true strength and courage are all about.Thank you, Immaculee, for sharing your beautiful soul. It is truly a gift of love and compassion."
5,Left To Tell - A book you will never forget.,"Immaculee's life was forever changed by the events that took place during the Rwandan Holocaust. Your life will be similarly changed when you read this book. I long for the day to come when this will be required reading in Middle and/or High School. You will wonder, as I did, how so much hate could exist and how forgiving some people can be. Some of the violence is graphic so young readers should be supervised. I cried so much while reading this book because the author so effectively described the people and the events in her life. I was also inspired by her life and words. Read this book!"
5,Left To Tell: Discovering God Amidst the Rwandan Holocaust,"This is an important book for three reasons: first, how difficult it is for less developed countries to move beyond the mythic membership level of consciousness; second, how important her capacity to develop a contemplative prayer form to keep her from despare during the time in the closet; and third, her realization that only forgiveness of those who put her in this difficult situation would allow her to move forward with her life."
4,Left to Tell,"Immaculee' Ilibagiza describes her family and her world in loving terms, and one is drawn into her story quickly. anticipation of what is coming to Rwanda held my attention and I so wanted all of them to escape. Alas, it was not to be; however, Immaculee' survival was truly amazing. The hardship of living with 6 ""strangers"" for three months and not being able to talk to them (except minimally) is almost overwhelming. The fact that they survived in a space smaller than most closets is an absolute miracle. I highly recommend this book to anyone able to read reality. Immaculee's total dedication to God and her survival ""plan"" (to learn English while she was waiting for rescue) was inspiring. To know she not only survived, but is thriving, is a wonderful bonus."
5,Left To Tell,"I could not put this book down. It may be the saddest, most compelling book I've read to date. Imaculee's strength & resilience to the genocide is inspiring."
5,Forgiveness is possible,"Immaculee gives us a picture of a loving family, pillars of the community. Their generosity is boundless. In many ways they help their neighbors...sewing uniforms for school for a poor woman who couldn't provide the required uniform for her child, building the community center, etc. It was all for naught. They were mercilessly slaughtered by neighbors. Immaculee escaped by following her father's command to go to the Protestant pastor, a Hutu who did shelter her and 8 others in his en suite bathroom for 3 months! During that time she developed a robust prayer life and taught herself English. Her faith in God, her trust in Him were boundless. This loving faith enabled her to be able to forgive the man who killed her family and led the mob to search for her. She powerfully describes the freedom that comes from being able to forgive. To be recommended to anyone who says that ""it's just too much. I couldn't forgive that!"" When we see what she had to forgive, nothing is impossible."
5,Uplifting,"How can a book about the Rwandan holocaust be uplifting? Well, it is, thanks to this author and her incredible attitude. She overcomes unbelievable heartbreak and hardship, but still looks upward. I loved this book. My entire book club loved this book and couldn't stop talking about it. I gave it as a gift to my mother-in-law, who raved about it. It makes you feel good about the world, yourself, God. It is a quick, easy read, but also riveting and hopeful. I highly recommend it."
5,Historical fiction,"I have a whole new respect for Rwanda and their heart wrenching battle to freedom. You will want to stand up and cheer for Immaculee! Her bravery and faith is so inspiring, you feel guilty for anything you have ever complained about in life. It gives you a new appreciation for living in a free country and every rationale for extending charity and assistance to all other countries in need as we are so able! But why wasn't the U.S. over there when they needed us both is the BIG question.VERY impressive read."
4,Above average book,"The book is well worth a read.It explains Immaculee's terror and turmoil about going into hiding, though little is mentioned about any communication between the girls.There is little historical perspective, however, as the events happening around them are not known due to being in hiding.Nonetheless, the suspense and the ending of the book are something else, and well worth the price of admission alone!Derek"
4,Trusting Faith,"Immaculee's trust in God's grace is amazing. I could'nt put the book down. My one disappointment is Immaculee's forward written by that New Age guru, Wayne Dwyer. It makes me slightly doubt Immaculee's total trust in the God, Jesus, as revealed in scripture and His church, the Catholic Church. Why is she associated with that kook!!!"
3,Amazing story; Poor writing,"The biographical story of Ilibagiza and her experience during the Rwandan holocaust is incredible. However, despite the acclaim for her co-author, Steve Erwin, the quality of writing is poor."
3,Buried in spirtuality...,"Considering that the author had to go through a genocide, it is quite obvious that some sort of spirituality must have been embraced by her. Hence, for illustrating the power of faith, the book is quite laudable. However, the reason why I consider this an ""o.k."" read is because throughout the book, the real plot is lost. Moreover, it seems as though the crux of the book is focused on God rather the real happenings of the genocide. This could be the case however, I feel that it's necessary not to have too much of one over the other. As a result, the book felt a little bit like a religion book. After I was done with the book, I wished that the author could have added little more of the emotional perspective. On the whole, this book makes a good summer read."
5,Inspiring and Powerful story.,"I did not know that a human being could endure so much. This story is an honest story about a strong and spiritual person that survived and endured the impossible. It is a testament to the strengh of this person and a very inspiring story. It makes you appreciate everything that you have in your life.It is also a story of the horrors that people can overcome and come out strong.Catherine CameronCrawfordville, FL"
5,Gripping and Remarkable,"Living in North America, many of us have not had to experience much hardship and certainly have never experienced the devastation that Ms. Ilibagiza has experienced during the Rwandan holocaust. Like most that have read this book, I too was unable to put it down and found myself sobbing through most of it. We can all learn from Immaculee's incredible journey and must all see that the slaughters in Rwanda and in Nazi Germany NEVER happen again."
5,Left to Tell,Remarkable story and I highly recommend it to others to read. The author was so detailed about the horrible events. I actually cried while reading the book.
5,Inspiring Story,"Left to Tell: Discovering God Amidst The Rwandan Holocaust by Immaculee Ilibagiza is a heart wrenching story of a young girl in Rwandan who was home from college to spend Easter with her family who were devout Catholics. A 3 month slaughter of one million people ensued. She only survived by hiding in a small bathroom for over 90 days with several other women, but she never lost her faith or her connection with God. If your faith is being shaken by today's troubles and tribulations... If you are searching for HOPE in a seemingly hopeless world..."
4,A worthwhile read...,"This book is an excellent book, that details a painful existence in impossible circumstances. It left me thinking about how amazing the human spirit is, and mesmerized at how anyone could survive such circumstances."
4,Best book I ever read,Thank you Immaculle in coming in mine life too. You have opened my eyes. This book and yourself have profound impact in my life. You have changed me forever. You have fully lived for your cause. You are the Living Goddess. I wish I meet you someday.This book is best book I ever read.
4,left to tell,"Book was in excellent condition. Amazing story of survival, also horrific description of the Rwandan Holocaust. Kind of a reality check of what happens outside the U.S. while we are looking the other way or shopping at the mall."
5,Great,"I loved this book. It was a required read for a class I am taking. Before buying it I went to a local bookstore to check it out. I sat down and three hours later the bookstore was about to close and I was halfway through the book. She recounts her experience through the Rwandan Holocaust in a very frank yet personal manner. Her story of genocide is so much out of my world but while reading it I sometimes felt like I was there with her, running through the night or hiding in the bathroom. The book deals with mature subjects and should be taken into consideration before reading. Other than that I would recommend this book to everyone. Hate and vengeance spread more hate and vengeance and it's inspiring to read how she handles it."
5,The Ann Frank of an African Holocaust,"This is an amazing story of a Tutsi girl's survival in a year when over 500,000 Tutsi were killed while the West slept. The chapters are chronilogical, short and gives us a real page turner that can be consummed in a holiday weekend or during a relaxing vacation week.The story is sad but the overwhelming message from Immaculee is of hope and forgiveness- even for those who allow kids to be eaten by dogs, commit mass rape and kill with machetes.Read this book- realize what hate can do, but more importantly how love and forgiveness can conquer anything, even genocide. This book can entertain, amaze and help the reader heal; one cannot help but hold Immaculee up as an amazing Catholic and human being."
5,one of those books that stays with you forever,"This book was so interesting I could not put it down.This book shows how the Rwandan Holocaust impacted a very close loving family.Even though I read it about 2 years ago I still think about it, it is one of those books that stays with you. I just don't feel like writing a long review but I would highly recommend reading it and would recommend this book as a summer reading book for high school students."
5,Inspired,"Immaculee's story is so inspiring and incredibly humble. I am forever changed by it. It is a must read by every person, every where."
5,Book review for Left to Tell,"This book amazed me. I can't believe that people can behave this way against others who they once called friends and neighbors. It is well written and easy to read. I couldn't wait to get home each day to read more - I found it captivating. It was also an amazing testament to her faith in God and how that helped her to survive. It is the type of book that is very interesting reading, educational and really makes you think."
5,Moving...Beyond Words.,"This book will forever change your life, and the way you view the world. It will leave you completely in awe of the human spirit, and of one woman's unshakable faith despite being faced with the unspeakable horrors of genocide. It will renew and strengthen your faith in God, in humanity, and give you a clearer perspective on the world in which we live.I got this book as a Christmas gift, and it is undoubtedly one of the most powerful things I've ever read."
4,Wished it was more in depth,"This is one of the most moving stories I've ever read. (and the first book I've actually given a review on here.)Mankind is sickening when you think of the atrocities that we do to each other. Her story is a powerful lesson on ""hatred"" and evil in general. But even more powerful - was Immaculee's faith in God throughout her ordeal. I feel like she was truly sent here from a higher power - acting as God's anchor/life boat to the world in telling her story. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars, is that I wish the book went into more detail at times. Every angle and everything she went through in her story is so overwhelming - at times it seemed simplified as compared to what she really must've gone through.But that's not a criticism - just a comment that this book left me wanting more. I hope she writes more - there are so many angles and teachings I think she could give based on what she went through.I will definitely pass this book onto many...."
5,"A haunting story of tragedy, faith, forgiveness, and healing","I just got done reading this book. Imaculee Ilibagiza not only survived the terrible genocide in Rwanda, she did not let what she experienced turn her bitter and hateful. This book is a shining testament to the best of the human spirit. That she survived is a miracle in itself, however the bigger miracle is that she has found a way to forgive those who hunted her and her family. I read this book through tears, both tears of deep sadness, and tears of triumph in the end.Anyone not moved by this book, after reading it, truly has a hardened heart."
4,VERY comfortable but scuffs easily,"I love this shoe. I had one pair and found it to be my most comfortable shoe. Amazon had a great deal on it (about $40) so I got two more. I have a wide foot and can comfortably wear the standard size. The leather is very soft. While this makes it more comfortable, it also means that it scuffs easily. My first pair is out of commission (after less then one year) because someone at a wedding stepped on it and now the leather is ""ripped"". I will only wear my new pair at work."
2,Poor film quality,"I was disappointed of the quality of the film, a poor transfer from the original format to DVD. Nowhere it said that it was in Black and White format, I was expecting the theatrical Technicolor version."
2,Very Disappointing,"Mary Higgins Clark used to write excellent mystery thrillers.This book shows nothing of that talent. There is no character depth, no real suspense, and no attempt to involve the reader in the story. I only hope the author will return to her old form in her next book"
1,What A Dud!!!!!,"Can you imagine being kidnapped, held in a damp basement, tied with rope and duct tape to a chair with a cloth sack over your head and feel disappointed because you were going to make garlic chicken for your husband fom a new recipe you found? Honestly, that is one of the paragraphs in this book and it goes into detail about how much she loved to cook, where she learned and how she gets to cook one night a week while her husbands cordon bleu chef is off, all this while she is being held prisoner. I've enjoyed her other books but this one is a RIP-OFF!"
3,New Detectives,"Clark introduces her new husband and wife sleuths Henry and Sunday in a fast moving political intrigue. Henry retired from political world at the end of his presidency married a much younger Sunday. They are at their best when they tackle solving crimes of the rich and famous of the political world. Henry and Sunday are most concerned about why would his former secretary of state take the fall in a crime of passion. They want answers to what happened on the presidential yacht. This was a fun book to read, however it is not among my top ten of her books. It is an interesting concept of and ex-president running around solving crimes. By Ruth Thompson author of ""The Bluegrass Dream"""
1,Mary Higgins Clark Shame on you!!! I'm so dissappointed ...,"I am so disappointed in this book. I have to say this is the first of her's that I am actually having to force myself to finish. The stories arejust so sugary pertaining to the husband and wifeteam it makes me ill. Please Mary, take your time creating your character's and don't disappoint us like this again. A questionable fan. Hope the next one restores my faith..."
2,Was her daughter Carol trying to help her meet a deadline!,"I enjoyed the first story, but thought her daughter Carol wrote it for her. The stories were unbelievable; no one gets into that much trouble"
2,Was her daughter Carol trying to help her meet a deadline!,"I enjoyed the first story, but thought her daughter Carol wroteit for her. The stories were unbelievable; no one gets into that much trouble"
1,Very Disappointing!,"I have read every one of her books and frankly could not wait for a new one to come out. Unfortunately, it looks like Mary and her publisher are trying to capitalize on her popularity by trying to see how fast she can produce new books, with little regard to content. Instead of ""I couldn't put it down"", this one was ""I forced myself to finish it just because I paid for it!&quot"
2,Was it writen by Carol rather than Mary?,"After about three pages I thought ""This wasn't writen byMary; it is the style of Carol, her daughter."""
1,Leave this book off your list of stocking stuffers,"Although the first story in this collection kept my interest, the second one almost made me quit reading altogether. Henry and Sunday are an amusing couple, but we are given only bare details about their character, such as how beautiful they are, how much money they make, etc. As a mystery fan, I was amazed to see how many ""clues"" Mary Higgins Clark dropped; unfortunately her sleuthing duo was not intelligent enough to pick up those clues, leading to last-minute coincidental rescues. A disappointment from one of my favorite authors"
4,Even my age loved it....,"I am only in the 8th grade and chose this book to do for a book report. I had read Mary Higgins Clark before and enjoyed her writing style. I think My Gal Sunday was one of her bests. (One of them.) I love that she starts the storys over as if it was a whole separate book. You could even read the stories out of order if you would like. (Which I Did.) I think it was great the she could get 4 different stories out of the same characters. I read other collections of mysteries, and this was definately the best one yet."
4,America's sweethearts solve the crimes and save the day,"M.H. Clark is a half-step above Harlequin romance novels in this connected series short stories involving the picture-perfect former president Henry Britland and his new wife, plucky Sandra ""Sunday"" O'Brien. Yes, you will be entertained, in that Ms Clark, as usual, keeps a lively plot and has interesting, if somewhat cartoonish, characters in each story. All romance is P.G. and except for some P.G. 13-style action in story number two, is actually not a bad book to read to more sophisticated children -- children who are at the upper limit of being read to. The last short story, a really implausible narrative of a five-year-old French boy lost in the New Jersey woods (don't ask) is good enough to induce tears and schmaltz worthy of ""The Other Manger"" by Molly Wadsworth."
4,My Gal Sunday,My Gal Sunday:Loved the short stories. I am a big fan of Mary Higgins Clark and always enjoy her books. First time I read 4 stories in one. They were cute!
1,"Mary, did you really write this book?","I must say I was a wee-bit disappointed in My Gal Sunday. No offense to Mary Higgins Clark but I felt as though her editor and publisher were desperate for her to write another book.I love her books but I can honestly say I would not recommend this book to anyone. Though I read the whole book (all four stories), I was anxious to get done with it.Sorry Mary, but it's not one of your better books."
1,Watching a wheel go round is more fun that reading this!,"Having read a few of Mary Higgins Clark's books I could notbelieve that this book was written by the same person. I have not been able to finish this book; it's so very very boring! This is a miserable collection of short stories and a complete waste of precious paper! I wish I could send it back for a refund - reason : lack of content, please recycle!"
1,Barbie and Ken go Sleuthing!,Give me a break! Although I do like mHC's work I found this tobe a bore. mHC is a good writer and when she wants can really draw a reader in but one irritating quality she has is that she uses uppity characters once too often; does the well to do only have fun? This is my one big complaint and since this book was such a bore to begin with using characters such as Henry and Sunday well that really did it to me. boring! mary honey there are others in the world besides snobs you can use to write about.
2,It's just too much!,"I didn't like this book since everything is just too good to be true, a fantastic expresident, a beutiful, talented congresswoman. They have no negative personal qualities at all and the worst is when congresswoman Sunday is kidnapped and even Saddam Hussein is eager to help. Please, be realistic! However, the book is written with humour and the stories are quite OK besides what I wrote above."
4,Fluff but fun,"Ok, so it wasn't a collection of mystery stories to make you think or keep you up at night, but it was a fun, quick read. Henry and Sunday are a likable couple and I look forward to reading more of their adventures."
4,"Good, but not as much suspense","Great characters, but it didn't have the suspense to want you to keep reading as much as others. Good for a relaxing quick read, though. I'd definately check it out!"
3,This was a departure for the author.,"Mary Higgins Clark's ""My Gal Sunday"" was a veryreadable book but not up to the author's usual standards. Her sleuthing married couple were reminiscent of Nick and Nora Charles, as well as Agatha Christie's Tommy and Tuppence; the setting and the characters' positions, as ex-president and Congresswoman, mindful of the mysteries by Elliot Roosevelt and Margaret Truman. My goal had been to read a mystery novel while on vacation, and this book accomplished it for me. What it didn't do was keep me up nights, for which I guess I should be grateful. Missing was the page-turner excitement of the author's previous books. Nevertheless, I will look forward to further adventures of Henry and Sunday Britland, with the hope that they will be more thrilling and less predictable"
1,I was not impressed,"My gal Sunday was very unimaginative. I kept hoping that the book would get better but it never did. This is the first book by Mary Higgins Clark that I have read, and I was not impressed. The charecters in the book were boring and they really weren't anyone I would want to met because they weren't interesting enough. I would not recommend this book to anyone unless you need a book to help you fall asleep."
3,4 stories in one,It was 4 different stories. Had the same main people but different stories. I have read better books by this author.
2,Itssss just too much!,"I didntttt like this book since everything is just too good tobe true, a fantastic expresident, a beutiful, talented congresswoman. They have no negative personal qualities at all and the worst is when congresswoman Sunday is kidnapped and even Saddam Hussein is eager to help. Please, be realistic! However, the book is written with humour and the stories are quite OK besides what I wrote above."
3,they've done better,L.A. Connection rewrites the script to their own comic intentions. Their other works are very funny but shorter. This one is a bit too long to carry the gag. I recommend this to really big fans of the Connection. Would also be good for a party with alcohol plied crowd enthusiasm.
5,Temperate Forests,"Starts with an introduction to the ""Biomes of the World"" then focuses on temperate forests around the world. Explains why temperate forests only grow in certain regions. Very informative and well researched. I only had two small complaints. Every so often the author used a rather slangy phrase which seemed out of place. Second, I did not like the way some of the maps were arranged. Those maps have red numbers marking the large areas of forests in a country and then the reader has to look at a separate list to read about the forests. I found them the hardest part of the book to read and enjoy. KWR, Children's Science Book Review"
3,The Miracle,"Everyone should read this book. Believers and Unbelievers alike. Prophecy will soon begins to happen, so you can understand what is happening around you. Great read. ***** five stars material."
3,Be careful!,"These are not the studio versions of these songs. They are live acoustic versions. The album isn't bad --if you want a sort of ""unplugged"" version of the songs. But we aware that these are not the album or studio cuts from the 70's."
1,Look what she's done to her songs!,"I always loved Melanie's hits when they were popular the first time around, so I was delighted to find this CD, not knowing that the songs were remakes. No description of this collection anywhere, not even the CD insert, mentions this fact. The versions are not as we remember them from ""the good ol' days""! She has slowed them down and even given some a country/western feel. Her voice remains wonderful, but when I buy an album for the sake of nostalgia, I want to hear the original versions. That's not the case here!"
1,Not a Good Teaching Tool for Everyone,"I was disappointed in this book for several reasons. First, the stickers can be confusing to someone who actually wants to learn to read music. Some stickers are numbers rather than the actual note names. This makes the transition from numbers to note names difficult for us. Also, the songs are mainly older classic show tunes and swing. While they are great songs, not many younger people (under 50) have heard them or are familiar with them. In the user's mind, there is no awareness of how the song is supposed to sound, so it is difficult to know when a mistake is made or to mentally anticipate upcoming notes. Normally, I love Reader's Digest books. Unfortunately, I felt that this book was not up to their typical standards."
1,You got to be kidding me...,"My wife picked up this book to learn the piano. The white key stickers went on with out a hitch. The black keys..... Well, once applied, the information cannot be seen. The black stickers are fine on a white background, but on a black background, the info disappears. Now to search the web to look for a solution. So far, nothing... :( Off to the Reader's Digest site to leave a comment there.....As far as the song selection, pretty weak as others have mentioned. As far as the trouble learning the numbers and letters, well, that will have to wait until she can actually use the thing!!!!Anyone have a solution to the problem?"
4,iit's OK,"it proved to be what it said it would be. Good for a new player, good short cut. Nice book."
1,"Seriously, $40 for a bootleg CD of an indie band? I bet you're not even giving them any of the money!","I think the title says it all... what a ripoff, making money off of these guys (who are really nice guys, by the way)."
4,I love to laugh,"I Am What I Ate. . .and I'm Frightened is a book anyone and everyone should read. Those who have problems with cholesterol, or those who pretty much have any health problem, or for even those who love food and would DIE to give their favorites up and only be able to eat them every ""once in a while"" (3 months) will love this book. Bill Cosby really illustrates his many situations with food, and what he can and cannot eat. There are many times when you wonder where he gets his stories, and how many other people there are out there that relate to his stories. But, at the same time, you wonder how it is that he has funny stories that he can tell about and you never do, and they all happen to be from his personal life. This book made me laugh, snicker, and giggle out loud. All I can say is, if you love to laugh you'll be floating on the ceilings (Mary Poppins) because of this book.And why would you wear a cotton sweater in the winter? I guess you'll just have to read the book."
2,Not really all that funny,"OK, so I like Cosby, always have, but I did not find much in this little book that made me laugh."
3,Searching for the health part in organizations,"As a Gestalt-consultant I like the gestalt-approach to organizations.The book is clear in its examples and descriptions.I like the very complete descriptions of the contactmechanismes.But by focussing on the neurotic behaviour only as problematic behaviour, I missed the fact that in each neurotic behaviour there is also the quality of the organization.The contactmechanismes were seen mainly as disturbances and too less as mechanismes.By this way the book is quite justmental and not as phenomenological as I expected from a gestalt point of view."
3,Cd production,I've just received the book and CD set. The CD production is not very good as the speaker is cut off in certain parts to say what is coming next.
3,New to Welsh,"Just in receipt--without CDs or a classroom experience, Welsh should not be attempted. It will take this summer's efforts for sure."
2,Poor quality,I bought these cranes based on the reviews they got but I am very disappointed. Immediately upon taking the cranes out of the box I noticed that the paint was peeling off. I can't see them holding up in the weather. I would not recommend these at all.
5,Very pretty,"We put a small pond into our backyard and added some goldfish. I put these metal herons near it, they look pretty and hopefully will discourage the real ones and other birds to leave the fish alone."
5,remote control extension cord,"I was looking for such an item and found one here on Amazon. Altho sent to my prior address by mistake by Amazon not updateing my shipping and billing addresses I recieved it quickly and was happy with the quality and price. They ""tried harder""and were sucessfull. Thanks"
2,fluff and inconsistancies drown this book.....,"As other reviewers have stated, this book was 1)-too fluff-many scenes were just not needed and didn't even relate to the hero/heroine and they dragged the book down. 2)-inconsistancies and typos abound-for example-the heroine is described as pale in one chapter and deeply tanned the next. 3)-too much purple prose-I think this must be a Drake hallmark. 4)finally-all the above problems just made the book flat BORING.Not recommended.2 stars."
2,Not Free SF Reader,"A pretty mundane, pretty much died in the wood I would guess romance.New Orleans vampires in the past, and present, circle around each other, as does a cop and a rich girl. Not too many interesting elements to be found here, and it is laid on reasonably thickly.Easily avoidable, as far as the whole paranormal thing goes it is pretty dull."
2,Not her best work.,I've read several of Shannon Drake/Heather Graham books and I didn't think this was her best work.
5,This is an awsome romance/vampire novel,"I loved this book. It too me 3 days to finish this book because I couldn't put it down! The charaters are well developed, and the plot is pretty believable. I recommend it to anyone loves romance with a little mystery tied in to it. AAA+!"
5,Couldn't Put It Down!,"I love vampire stories. I am very partial to anything vampire-like and when I found this book, I couldn't resist. The romance between Sean and Maggie is very enduring. At first I wasn't sure what happened to Maggie--did she became a vampire? However, I cannot reveal everything. I also like the reincarnation aspect of the story as well. This is a good vampire book to read and I cannot wait for Drake's next vampire book."
3,Who proof read these books?,"I loved this series of books! I invested in these kindle books, as an easy way to travel with a large amount of diverse reading material. Did anyone proof read them??? So many errors in basic spelling, as well as pages with two word, capitals in the middle of sentences and pages of just punctuation symbols. I bought three in this series for my kindle and two out of the three are like this. Some pages it is a guess to make out what a sentence says. PLEASE do a better job, here. I realize these books are on the cheaper end of kindle books, but come on!!"
3,Entertaining read. Terrible formatting,"The story wasn't bad although I was happy to see that it improved with Chapter 1. The formatting is dreadful. I am reading on a Kindle 2 and the pages are breaking in the middle of the screen, often in mid-sentence."
3,Buy the paper & ink version - not the Kindle version,"Wow! I would love to have the Audible.com rating system right now. I would give the story a 5 but the format a 1.In my attempt to declutter I've been purchasing Kindle books to replace paperbacks that I love. Please DO NOT waste your money buying the Kindle version of this book. The typos are horrendous. The editing errors in the Kindle version are very distracting. I had to stop and decipher what word the author meant to use several times because the Kindle version substituted numbers or punctuation marks in place of letters. Please buy the book, just stay away from the Kindle version of it."
3,For vampire fans,"It seems that every vampire novelization changes the rules of vampirism just a bit to fit their purposes. This series is no different, but here it seems to work. Police officer Sean Canady has to solve the murders of several New Orleans prostitutes that are eerily similar to the killings of Jack the Ripper. Clues lead straight to Maggie Montgomery whose family has been entwined with Sean's for generations. Is Maggie a murderess or is she being set up? Or is she maybe something else all together?The first book in Drake's vampire series has a decent plot, and wonderful descriptions of the city of New Orleans, but some mildly irritating main characters. Also a little too much historical information is imparted to characters (and, thereby, the reader) as dialogue, which seems awkward.Although the vampire thing seems a little cliché at this point, it's still an entertaining novel and one I would recommend to romance readers as well as vampire enthusiasts."
3,good story,"although I did enjoy this book, i thought the stroy line felt like it was missing something. It is a good book though."
1,Not impressed with this book.,I'm not impressed with this book by Ms. Drake. It wasn't worth the money I paid for it.
5,Excellent Vampire Book!,I bought this book when I was 18 years old and I absolutely loved it! I would recommend it to anyone who likes vampire books.
5,Great Quality! Full Show!,"This is the best Broadway karaoke album I have in my collection. It has the entire musical score faithfully created. If you do theater to recorded tracks, this has everything you need for a production of West Side Story. Having been disappointed with many of the Broadway tracks avaiable because of either being incomplete or poor arrangements, I was thrilled with this CD. One of the best of the genre."
3,"Great, but see that there's a new cd coming out","This is a good, albeit quiet recording. The volume level seems quite low. I see there's a new version of West Side Story coming out on a accompaniment cd that includes some of the overlooked dance music in this version."
2,Where's the sizzle?,"I bought this CD for a single song, ""America."" A group of Japanese ESL students saw the Broadway production and were inspired to perform that number. But it was unusable. The tempo was much slower than the original, and the orchestration was spare and bland, lacking the brass and percussion that really makes the piece. It seemed like an elevator-music version. It may be suitable for drunken, middle-aged party-ers, but not for young people. I would have returned it, but thought the other songs might come in handy later."
2,Disappointing,"Doug Smith is fabulous in person as a presenter and I was truly looking forward to reading his book. Perhaps my expectations were high, having heard him speak, but the inspiration and knowledge I was hoping to glean from his book were severely lacking. It is not well written and tends to overstate the same concept. There are better books if you are looking for any inspiration or personal growth."
2,Chris's account is self-serving,"By coincidence, I read the Velvet Doublet by James Street, just days before I unpacked the Log of Christopher Columbus. The two books cover virtually the same material from two distinctly different points of view. The detail and expanded coverage of the former (from the point of view of the Pinta/Nina sailors and captains) was highly instructional for reading and evaluating Chris' alleged version of the same events. For the price of the log, (expensive because it is out of print), the James Street book is reasonable, much more entertaining, highly constructive, and causes the reader to question the self-serving entries and omissions in 'the log'. If you are going to read a copy of a lost copy of a translation twice removed, why not just go to the well-written historical novel, which is much more readable?"
3,review,i like my book and i liked that it was shipped out immediately and i got it within 5 days i think it was.
4,indispensable for the student of the voyage....,"....and very easy to read. The English translation is very clear and put together from sources other than Las Casas, whose facts weren't always straight. For some reason the paragraphs are all center-justified and taper out oddly. Various theories about Columbus's landfall are discussed.The one flaw is the introductory pieces that whitewash the man himself. Made out to be a bold, great hero, he was in actuality a gold-obsessed sailor, a poor mariner, a perpetual whiner whose crew could barely stand him, an intolerant European who assumed every land he touched belong to his King back in Spain, and of course the initiator of the slavery system in Espanola. His men built the first fortress in the so-called New World, and they brought several Native captives back to Spain. Fortunately, some of these events are mentioned in the Log itself."
3,"Read Appendix I first, to see if you need to read the rest of the book","Tip: Start by reading Appendix I. It is an example of the technique that the author spends the whole book explaining. In fact, Appendix I may be all you need to get the gist of the technique."
2,Not what you think it is,"After reading this book, I went back to read the amazon reviews, and was rather confused. This book has a very narrow focus, and is not targeted at the typical person reading about design. Other reviews seem to suggest that this is a good book for people interested in design, but to put a different angle on it, it reads much more like a theoretical dissertation than a book on design.Unless that is what you are looking for, pass on this book. Unfortunately, I was forced to give this two stars due to the way it is presented on Amazon. If you are interested in highly abstract (as in analysis, not art) and theoretical design, then ignore my rating."
2,does not look like the picture - kind of ugly,"These bowls are described as simply ""white"" and you can't see any pattern in the picture, yet on receiving them I discovered that they have an embedded swirly pattern that isn't very attractive.Also, Amazon's packaging is ordinarily excellent, but in this case 2 of 4 bowls arrived broken and the same was true with the replacement shipment. Amazon was very nice and didn't make me return the broken bowls, but still, not very efficient."
5,LOVE these bowls,"very elegant, very versatile. i LOVE using these bowls for everything. I serve soup, rice, pasta, everything in it! the only thing I can't serve in it is ice cream."
4,Couple of things,I was happy with the book and it was in good conditionThe only thing it was a library book which I hope came thru on a book sale. I was disappointed that there were no pictures but I wasn't really unhappy with the service and condition
1,These reviews are bogus.,"Did the author make up these bogus five star reviews? It sure looks like it.The only interesting thing about this book is that there is a character named Tom McVey who bombs a building in OKC, etc. with paralells to the actual bombing. This manuscript was written in 1991, but I'm not sure if this part was in it. If it was, makes we wonder how Keating knew of this. His brother is Governor Frank Keating of OK."
1,The whisk that never showed,I ordered the pampered chef stainless whisk and it has never arrived. A message was sent to the vendor but there was no reply.
1,Left me confused,"I never got this order. My email was messed up and when I asked the seller about the order they told me they sent it to my amazon email. After learning seller was waiting on my okay to ship, I said okay but never heard from seller again. Amazon says it shipped but then I received notice that my money had been refunded b/c seller had canceled the order but I have no idea why."
2,"It is most certainly a ""Bootleg""...","The original title was ""The Ratings Game"".The copy sold here on Amazon is definately a ""Bootleg"" copy released by an unknown production company.The picture is barely watchable and is ""hazy"" at times.The movie itself is quite funny and well worth 10 or 12 bucks if you can get a decent copy.Bring this one out every 4-5 years or so,otherwise more frequent viewings will cause it to lose its' appeal.The fictional cartoon in the movie titled ""Goombah's"" should tell you what type of laughs that you'll get with this cult movie from the mid 80's."
2,If you find another source...,"If you find another source for this movie, pursue it!I liked the movie very much, and saw it first produced on Showtime Entertainment. This copy appears to be burn made from someone's TV set.Good movie for cheesy fun films, poor quality recording."
4,Unusual,Although there aren't any main stream actors in the movie it does have an intriguing story line and surprising ending. Not an A list movie but certainly different and better than most of the other B type movies out there.
3,Who was the real Katy?,"Was Katy sincere in her songwriting for this album, or was she just using Christian music as a vehicle to try and break into the industry in general?She now is known as Katy Perry, and has released a CD with adult oriented themes like ""..I kissed a girl and I liked it.."" and ""..UR so Gay"".Her website blog uploads are filled with profanity now. If she was sincere on this CD, then what happened?Who was the real Katy? What happened to her?The 180 she's done now is truly disturbing.If you liked this, DON'T buy the ""katy perry"" cd. You will be sorely disappointed and saddened at what she has become."
2,Katie Perry's Former Life,"This is Katie Perry before she kissed a girl and liked it, and it's hard to believe she ever did Christian music. It's the same voice, which I find strange to listen to, and it's the same overproduction, but you have a totally different genre here."
3,i kissed jesus and i loved it,which albums lyrics have a better message ?the katy hudson cd...which cd has better drums and beats?hot and cold and kissed a girl....which cd would i buy my daughter?katy hudson...im waiting for i kissed jesus christ and i loved it
3,A great talent but get another producer next time!,"I first heard Katy Hudson on a Christian TV show a few years back playing an acoustic version of ""Growing pains"".I dont really listen to much Christian music but I thought her performance,the way she related to the audience,to be fantastic.I then heard the same song on her album and I was very dissapointed.Not because of Katy,but because of the producer who turned a great song into an overblown broadwayesque production .I dont know who he or she is but the record company shouldnt let this person near her on the next CD.What would be great for Ms.Hudson would be a nice stripped down acoustic/electric band.Too bad she cant get someone like Freedy Johnston,another singer songwriter to produce it.They would make a great team."
4,More to come from Katy Hudson,"I really enjoyed her first album and can't wait for her second album, to see how much she's progressed. I'm hoping for an album that's not over-produced, as I feel this was just a bit over the top. None the less, I think everyone should hear this singer. For an 18 year old (16 when the CD released), I'm very, very, impressed."
3,Very Original But Kind of Long...,This book has a very clear message for humans. It is from the point of view of elephants...Very endangered elephants. Very real and sad sometimes. The only setback with this story was the length of it. I felt like I was going around in circles like the elephants. Good read but too long...
2,good idea poorly executed,"I'm in agreement with the other reviewers who found the book difficult to get into. The names of the characters are confusing, and too much time is taken by explaining (fictional) elephant mythologies and legends, not enough on actual behaviors and facts. Sorry, I just couldn't get into this book, and returned it to the library only half-read."
3,disappointing,"I also am an elephant lover. And some aspects of this book were terrific. But as a whole I was disappointed. It got very repetitive by the middle, very similar things happening over and over to the elephants, like the author was trying to fill the pages to make it a book. And the ending was a huge let down. It was like the story just stopped."
2,I'm so sorry to be disappointed,"Like many other reviewers, I really wanted to like this book. I love elephants and am empathetic to and horrified by their plight. I thought Watership Down was a Great Book in all the many ways it could be. But this one . . . it just bogged me down. The name scheme was silly, the elephants' thought processes were way too anthropomorphic, there was no climax and no ending. I wanted to care what happened to Mud, but when the book was over, I was just relieved. It should have made me cry."
1,Very disappointing,"I honestly don't know how this book can have so many positive reviews. I found this book absolutely tedious and boring. The characters were developed badly, the plot didn't seem to ever really appear and the ridiculous naming of them all was just distracting and made it too hard to work out who was who. I'm a zoologist, I should have loved this, unfortunately it's going back to the library unfinished. I'll never read anything from this author again."
1,pretentious drivel,This book could not have disappointed me more. Not only was it painstaking to follow but was totally lacking in any positive message. I had hoped that there might be an inspiring moral lesson to be gleaned from a fictional account of elephant life. Bygones!
1,Wanted to Like it,"I came read others' reviews because I couldn't believe how much I was dreading each page of this book when I'd expected to love it. Those who liked it, seem to have liked it from the first page and those who didn't like it, responded to it the way I have responded. I'm about a third of the way through the book and think it is time for me to find something to read that touches me. Much as I love elephants and as horrified as I am about their plight, this book is leaving me cold. In the hands of a good author, I'd be putty."
2,Tried to read twice....,"I love elephants. I think they are wonderful creatures with great heart and soul, however, I didn't like this book. The strange thing is...I can't put my finger on why I don't like the book. I've tried twice to read it and put it down both times."
1,The Boring Bone,"This is one of the most slow moving and boring books I have ever read! I love animals, especially elephants but could not even FINISH this one!! I was thoroughly disappointed in this story. The eternal and endless search for the white bone went on...and on...and on...and on...and on...and...."
1,mislead,"I didn't know this was going to be the ""Clan of the Cavebears"" meets elephant. Please. Between the stupid ""mythology"" and the part about, er, the role of the male in sex I KNEW I had made a big mistake. It went in the trash with only a couple of chapters read."
2,Too hard on me.,"I wish I hadn't read this book. It is well written and wonderfully imaginative in its portrayal of what elephants might be behind their deep eyes but If I had known how terribly sad and pointlessly and realistically tragic it was I never would have taken the journey. I am sad enough for real elephants.. I do what I can for them.. I don't need to mourn the deaths of what came to be friends as bitterly as I did. Tall time's death was particularly savagely written and jarring and I resent the way it made me feel. Sadly, I will not trust this author again. In my opinion it was a very bleak and pointless story and I would be very cautious about who I recommended it to."
5,One of the best books I've readI couldn,"I couldn't put this book down! Amazing story written from the perspective of elephant families. I can only recommend this book! There are a lot of names and different words for things, but I found it not hindering but exactly the opposite! It made it that much more realistic and enjoyable."
4,Neat Design Love the Notches..,Neat bowls that may never get used for rice but I'll have a lot of fun serving salad in them and using the chopsticks to eat it.
1,not just the whale,"This is not a CD of whale song- it is drowned out by folk guitar and other instrumental music. Some people like the combination, i was expecting just the whale."
2,Don't read if you have conservative values,"The book was just ~OK~ and it kept me somewhat interested. The writing was well-done, but the plot was weak and the details were vague. As a conservative Christian, however, I felt that the author used her book to trash conservative values. She didn't outright attack them, but she sure made it clear that her character was a liberal democrat, and anything else is just not worth her time. Subjects such as nude art and abortion are covered. ""The embryo that was killed (aborted) was only a potential person, not a real one."" I'm not here to debate, just warn people that have similar values as me.If the book had been better I might have been able to overlook the jabs, but as it stands, I don't recommend this book."
5,Pure genius!,"Light-hearted, upbeat, music that just makes you feel good. People who listened to Spiritualized's later recording ""Ladies and Gentlemen..."" will find a lot in common with this album. It's chaotic but beautiful in its own right."
3,pretty helpful,This was a good help and a good review to practice for the PSAT. It gave good techniques and information that were helpful in supplementing already existing knowledge on the topics. I'd recommend this book to anyone who wants a little extra information before taking the test.
4,An Outstanding Book,"This book is a book with a hint of love and chicken thieves. A loving grandmother and granddaughter are separated when the grandma goes to see a new baby. Ruby, the granddaughter , has to raise a new baby chicken while making a new friend. It's an outstanding book you should read it. It's a page turner.Emily E."
5,THANK GOD! PLEASE RELEASE SEASON 2!,Its about time this came out! Do you think we waited long enough? I will buy the entire series as they release it. I love this show!
4,Where is season two???,"Excellent show, one of my favorites. Great premise, great acting (especially the parents), great writing. I was delighted when season 1 was released, and hoped that meant that further seasons were coming soon. What's the delay, 20th Century Fox?"
5,Opposite Worlds Collide and Charm,"This is an all-time classic example of two different worlds attempting to live together. Dharma is your typical Pagan child, open in dialog and free of restraint. Greg is your typical Christian, straight-laced and firmly embedded in the corporate world. The way the two learn to live together in a marriage that to both seemed destined is just hilarious! Rarely in television are we treated to such a pefect cast.Some might say they are too stereotypical but I think instead the points to be made between the two worlds have never been done quite like this.I think Thomas Gibson is one of the most underrated actors around. He is simply, here, a great comic talent, and that's something we don't get to see on his new series, Criminal Minds.Treat yourself and join the clash!"
3,"Season 2 gets much, much better","Other than ep #21 (the ballroom dancing contest episode), season 1 wasn't that great, in my personal opinion, even though overall I believe this is one of the best sitcoms ever made; amazingly, shockingly underrated. It is no surprise why there are so many positive posts, grateful this show is FINALLY coming to DVD!Much like Sports Night, I think the biggest problem is that this show was just ahead of its time, but probably more than that both shows fell victim to ABC's insane management who were beyond obsessed with ""Who Wants to Be A Millionaire"", to the detriment of every other show on their schedule.Although, compared to today, when many new sitcoms don't even make it past half their first season (Jenna's ""Courting Alex"", for example), I guess one just has to be grateful Dharma & Greg made it to five seasons!"
5,Where O where is Season 2???,Dharma and Greg is an awesome series and I'm heartbroken that season 2 has not been released yet in Canada and the US. Season 1 is awesome but it's very disappointing to get to the end and then realize that you have no more episodes to watch! Please bring out season 2 soon!!!
5,More Dharma and Greg Please,I love Dharma and Greg Season 1. When will Seasons 2 thru 5 come out? That's the bummer. I'd love a complete set of this fun TV series.
5,A show that ended too soon,"This was a show that my family used to watch together in the 90s. Now, I'm enjoying it with friends and roommates... it's hilarious and incredibly sweet.This show starts with a couple that was meant to be together, who meet for the second time (though they don't know it), and get married on their first date. Then, they have to mix their hippie and ultra-conservative families."
5,WAY above average!!! Awesome series!!,I loved this series and what the reruns everytime I come across them on cable. What's the hold up with the release of the other season??????
5,Dharma and Greg,Excellent! Great characters and the humor is endless ... can't wait for Season Two to come out ...
3,hilarious,"It never fails to make me laugh. Despite their different mentalities, they're crazy about each other.Greg is a Harvard graduate (Law)and Dharma was homeschooled and is so into yoga & spiritual things.It is very different from shows that genre."
3,i have not seen a show liek this but it looks like a show that is funny!!!,when i read the descriptiion of the dharma and greg show i said THAT SOUNDS FUNNY somethimes when opposities attract it has results that are hilarious results if i get this for my birthday which is september the seventeenth i will right again and tell everyone how funny this show is!!! just thinking about a hippy family that is having to live with a nothippy family makes me laugh till my bellybutton comes untied!!! if my tv got the dharma and greg channel i would watch it but my brother broke the knob!!!! so now i have to get the dharma and greg dvd with the dharma and greg show on it so that i can see these funny things happen i can;t wait!!!
4,FUN!,"My childcare kids and grandkids love this type of activity book! You will have to do the cutting for younger kids but they love putting them together and giving them faces, etc."
5,Buy this Fantastic Book --If You Want to Buy A Home,"If you think that you are going to be kept out of the housing market forever, do yourself a favor and buy this book! It is so easy to read and understand, you'll feel as though the author is sitting across from you and just explaining what's what! This information is so important! Everything he says about this government program has proved to be true. I am now shopping for my brand-new, no down payment, manufactured home!"
5,Maybe All You Need,"Though this collection spans only about three years, it was the peak of the Tops output. Though later songs from the early to mid 70's are missing, to these ears they weren't as stunning as those collected here. I think Levi Stubbs was best on the melodramatic material presented on this collection-when he gets subtle, it isn't as effective. My personal favorites are ""Bernadette,"" ""Reach Out I'll Be There"" and ""Ask The Lonely."" (which should have been a bigger hit than it was) ""Ask The Lonely"" is a masterpiece that to my ears doesn't get the credit it deserves. This is the collection that got them into the Rock N Roll Hall of Fame."
2,"Although insightful, does not include summaries.","This book is a collection of essays about the book. It helps a lot for understanding the diffucult author, Homer. However, it contains no summaries for review or for when you simply did not read. Go for Barron's if that's what you want."
4,The universal themes are timeless!,"Achilleus gets his broad taken away by Agamemnon and gets angry. Goes and cries to his mother, Thetis, who is also the god of the seas, and tells Zeus to help the Trojans defeat the Acheans in revenge for her son. Hektor of Trojans kills Achilleus' closse friend (4got his name) and decides to get revenge and kills Hektor. All of this pretty much progresses into the fall of Troy."
5,Great for old-time distortion,"This is an excellent distortion pedal for people who want a traditional rock sound. I use it with a Fender Mustang amp and an Ibanez guitar with good humbucking pickups. It's very easy to use and rugged. If you play metal, you might want to get the HardWire TL-2 instead; that pedal delivers more distortion (an insane amount, if necessary) and more tone control, but it's also more expensive. But you can easily boost the distortion achieved by the DS-1 by using it with your amp on an overdriven setting. The DS-1 is an excellent general purpose distortion pedal. I don't know of any other that achieves this level of quality in the same price-range."
2,Nothing Special,I wasn't impressed with this pedal at all. It sounds really cheap and there isn't a whole lot you can do with it. I'd shell out the extra $20 and get a Big Muff.
5,Boss DS-1 is a good item to play with.,The product is awesome to play with.The distortion sound is very good.I highly recommend this product who looking for a gear.
4,Use With Finesse,"I bought this pedal for use in my project studio. I wanted some creamy overdrive and increased sustain for my Strat. It's a good pedal, but it does require a little finesse. If you turn everything up to ""11,"" it sounds pretty bad--harsh and abrasive. By backing off the output (""volume"" knob) from the guitar, you can get some good rock tones, at a variety of distortion levels. Want it a little grungier? Turn up the distortion. A little edgier? Turn up the tone control, to increase the treble. Use the volume knob to control your levels into your amp or mixer. Simple. Just don't max out the guitar output going into the unit, and you'll have tons of tonal colors to play with. I'm running the pedal as a DI box, straight into the mixer, with some outboard compression from a rack mounted unit. Makes some very sweet sounds. Very easy for recording. But one caveat: This is pretty much for lead guitar, only. It's too grungy for chord work."
2,Dont bother,"This pedal is just terrible. Sure its a BOSS, so its not going to break, but the distortion is just awful sounding. Its thin and weak sounding and just muddles everything up. If you buy this pedal, your eventually going to want an upgrade, so why bother?"
2,Not the best,Basic distortion / nothing fantastic. Range is limited . Its a good pedal for someone just starting out.Constructed well looks good sounds less than average. Tried to drive it and it just gets worse. Great pedal for a kid to play with but on stage don't bother.Selling mine off for some new strings.For the cost your getting ripped off / go with Mod Tone or DigiTech you can't go wrong.
5,if your amps gain setting sucks....,"this a great choice for a quick fix. i just purchased this pedal a week ago and havent stopped fiddling with it yet. its well built and sounds great paired with my SG. Now im not an officianado on tone but this pedal drastically improved mine, also when paired with my blues overdrive pedal it screams. i paid 29.99 for this pedal thats incredible value. so if your struggling getting a good crunch from your amp id highly recommend this pedal. also as a side note if your new to pedals in general the manual comes with generic settings to get you close to a sound your looking for and then you can just tweak it to taste."
4,"A very basic pedal, but a good start for anyone.","Here it is. The famous Boss DS-1. Some love it. Some hate it. Though I can agree with both standpoints to some degree, I enjoyed this pedal a lot. It was my first distortion pedal, and when you first start playing, distortion is distortion, right? I was ready to rip someone's face off with Green Day's power chords, and this pedal pulled through it all. To a seasoned guitarist, this pedal may sound tinny, thin, or fake. But, for the price, I think it's still a great sound. If you're looking for a basic distorted sound for a pretty decent price, the DS-1's got your back, man. If nothing else, it will help beginners start to understand what qualities they're looking for in a distortion pedal. Though it's not my favorite pedal I've ever purchased, and I don't use it much anymore, I will never regret my purchase of the Boss DS-1."
2,Save your money,"Product didnt lower coolent temperature in both vehicles it was used in.Followed the instructions, added proper number of ounces to cooling systems,saw no noticable reduction in coolant tempertures in either motor."
3,not sure about this,I added this to my truck but I could not tell a difference. I do not rememeber exactly but I think I needed 2-3 bottles for the correct mixture on my truck and I only used 1 so that was probably my issue.
5,Cool as Purple Ice,"All performance enthusiasts and racers agree: Royal Purple puts out some of the best vehicle fluids you can get anywhere. Only Red Line products come close but I use royal Purple motor oil as well and can really tell the difference. If it is Royal Purple, it is one of the best ever."
3,"It is not 16 oz bottle, but 12 oz","This is advertised loud and clear as the 16 oz bottle. However, when I opened the box, it was 12 oz. I don't know who to blame, royalpurple.com or amazon.com.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------The vendor has updated the listing and now it shows the 12 oz bottle instead of 16 oz. They also explained the difference of the upgraded 12 oz version with the old 16 oz version in the comment area of my initial review. I accept that. So, I edited my review. Thanks for the response. However, the engine of my car has been as hot as before, and I didn't observe any drop in temparature. As such, I only upgraded the 1-star rating to 3-star rating. 01/29/2012"
2,smaller size than shown,"As far as the product goes I would rate it 5 stars. But the ad says it is a 16 0z. bottle,and what you are paying for is a 16 oz. bottle, but what you get is a 12 0z. bottle.Cost too much to return, will not order this again from Amazon."
2,Not Much of a Difference?,I have an 89 jeep cherokee known for running HOT!! and I ran it through w/antifreeze and did not notice a difference then ran it w/straight water and it ran a little cooler but it still overheated going up hill in hot weather and sitting in traffic.
3,i didn't get what i expected,I bought this on the manufacturers name. I expected the temps of my engine to lessen slightly in the brutal Texas heat. I did not notice a significant change on my analog gauges. maybe 3-5 degrees. this product did not do what i expected.
1,This product is not what it seems,"I bought this product as a replacement for my old Pinnacle DC10+ which refuses to work correctly on my new system. The Cameramate Video Safe claims to capture video at full NTSC resolution which is 720x480. However, even after setting the capture resolution to this in the ProPix Software, it still captures only at 352x240 which is roughly half of NTSC resolution. I also tried to capture with other capture software and the highest capture resolution I could get was the beforementioned 352x240. What the ProPix software does is scale up the captured video to NTSC resolution which results in poor quality (even at the so-called ""Best"" quality setting). I suppose the cheap price should've tipped me off that this wouldn't be a quality product. I will be returning this product and spend the extra money to get a capture device that can capture 720x480 and not half that and scale it up."
1,Video transfer software,I have no success in trying to use this product. Tech service has been of no help. The software has corrupted my computer. I would not recommend this product to anyone.
1,No what I was expecting,"I buy this very eager to transfer my DV tapes from my DVH 100a panasonic camcorder, but when I start to used it, I realize that I don't have a choice for data video generation on my Hard Drive at my PC. The quality of the video is to poor and the sound regulary is out of time with the video motion. Very frustrating for me when after tranfers each dv tape I have to edit and masterize the video quality and the sound speed very bad. Horryble for me."
5,Zio Cameramate,This was very easy to install and use. The copies came out beautiful. Recommended this product to my friends with VHS tapes.
1,Junk! Don't buy,"This light is a cheap made junk. Had it for about 2 weeks & the light stopped working & the lid does not fit a 20 gallon tank! Had to have plexi glass cut to set the lid & light on top so I could have a lighted tank. Bulb was fine. I thought it was the switch & I took it out & just wired the light so you could just un plug & plug in whenever you want to use the light. Did not work. DON'T BUY! Save your money because not only did I waste $42, buy another $12 to get plexi glass cut & now I have to buy a new light! What a rip off!"
5,Quick Delivery,"I got this item to replace the lights for the set I'd bought from Pet Smart. It was about half the price as the same item from the store, and I got it the day after I ordered it."
2,Woops,"I choose this lid because of the picture. It's shape, the woodgrain, the color, all exactly like one I have on my 55 gal. Unit arrived, was black, no woodgrain, a different style that won't even fit, and worse quality than what I had. Rather ticked off, I just threw the whole damn thing in the garbage. Could have easily done a return or chargeback for false advertising but frankly don't have the time."
1,"Not quite ""sounds of nature""","If you're looking for a recording of ocean waves, don't get this CD. It's a recording of cheesy music with the ocean in the background, which comes out sounding like static."
2,A Far Cry From The Mysteries of Pittsburgh,"Don't waste your money. Spend it on something inviting and enjoyable. I read The Mysteries of Pittsburgh twice I enjoyed it so much. A collection of short stories, I thought, would be great summer reading. NOT! Something happened to Chabon. I was barely in my teens when I read Mysteries. Chabon was barely in his twenties. After reading the short stories, it was hard to believe that this man has a wife, and children, especially. He seemed old and detached from life, not wise. The writing was strained and contrived. I think I have an excellent vocabulary, but I looked up a few arcane words. They added nothing to the stories. I hope Chabon was just going through personal problems and this was a slip."
1,Worst kind of garbage posing as literature,"I just read one of the stories from this book because my visiting cousin (16 years old) has it assigned for classwork. She said it was ""the dumbest thing"" she had ever read. Thinking she migh be missing something, I read the story myself. She is correct. This is the type of verbal diarrhea that causes young people to dislike literature. What a sad commentary on our culture that this is considered worthy of study in any context."
4,My first Chabon experience--by no means my last,"I'll take an uneven, fearless collection of stories anyday over a homogeneous, sparkling parcel of prose. Chabon's effort is certainly in the former category, and after the first two stories I felt the way I do whenever I encounter someone truly great--I'm [mad] that I'm not him. Some have charged the writing here is forced and too ""literary,"" but there is a rolling charm that type of style often produces. The subject matter is emotionally charged, and the sometimes jarring storytelling elevates these stories beyond melodrama and into the realm of insight.After sampling the self-indulgent, immature (but often entertaining) offerings of other young Americans (Eggars, Sedaris, Foster Wallace) recently, Chabon's mostly successful attempts to wrap his voice around more adult themes is rewarding.Sure, you might need a dictionary, but grab a pencil, too--there are scores of headshaking insights and descriptions to note in this ambitious collection."
3,Werewolves in Their Youth: Stories,"This book is a set of short stories, and none of them have werewolves in them. But all of the stories have a point where the main Character reaches a place in thier lives where they have a sort of ""Changing"" or a realization of who (or what) they are really. I really liked a couple of the stories, but there were a few that I didn't care for, but over all I found it was worth the read and not a total waste of time."
4,english libtretto of russian opera,"I had ordered this item believing it to be bilingual english-russian, and in fact it is a performers' translation for performing the opera in English.Nevertheless I am glad to have as it greatly enhances my appreciation of the Russian CDs I have. I don't know whether a bilingual edition is in fact available.Response and delivery time were perfect"
3,AMAZONMAN IS NOT AMUSED,Everything is fine except that I purchased a Russian opera hoping to get a Russian libretto. Maybe I didn't read the details clearly before I purchased this but it only has an English libretto. Bummer.
5,Very beautiful,"This is my first puzzle I bought and I am very happy I decided to start with this one. The edges proved to be challenging, and this is possibly the first time I ever finished the edges last. The pieces are cut in a unique style which puts my second puzzle's pieces I bought to shame. My parents loved the look so much when it was finished, they decided to hang it up in their home."
2,Not for anyone over 5 feet tall,"These pj's state they have a pant length of 41"". 41"" sure, 28"" inseam. They are at my ankle if the crotch is at my knees. The waistband fits comfortably at my breast, nothing like fleec capri's for winter. My ankle's are going to freeze."
4,Arrived Fast,Out of about 6 items I ordered at the same time this one arrived first.I got these as a gift for my sister and she seemed to like them.
4,nike puple watch,"i had a brown one and wanted another. like the color purple a lot but would prefer the wristband ""holds""--2 of them on the inside of the wrist-- to be the same color as the watch, rather than light gray.would like them (rubber ""clasps"") to be less noticeable.the brown version had brown clasps which looked better."
5,It's Purple.......,My GF loves purple and works in the NICU. This watch is perfect for that and she loves it. It comes off easy and cleans up even easier. Highly recommended.
2,Not realistic,"I'm interested in X10 projects as well as other home automation projects throughout the house but I thought this book was a little out of tune to what you realistically would do. I was captured by measuring the temperature of a grill and adjusting the heat. This is showing you a control for a ""smoker."" Other items you can easily find on the internet such as X10 devices, sprinkler control, etc."
3,Nikon Flash Guide,It was some what out of date. It didn't have the latest flash equipment.I sent it back
4,Nice duck boots!,"These duck boots are nicely made. They feel a tiny bit large, but I can make up the difference with thicker socks."
4,Finally available On CD,And at a decent price. I first heard Passport on a local College station back in the early 70's. the electric/progressive/jazzy/spacey rock of the Albatros song peaked my interest enough to find and purchase Doldinger Jubilee'75. It is still one of my favorite CDs in my 1.000 or more collection. I had always heard that this Cd existed but could never find it. Most of the Passport stuff I own is on vinyl with all the great cover art that comes with it. But this release had eluded me until now. Wow Brain Auger is on this one. This is a must have for any Jazz rock prog. fan. All but one of the songs (I just want to make love to you) smoke. I give this a 4 star only because the later Jubilee'75 is a 5. If your a fan you must have both.
4,Art Deco board,I wanted a new salad bowl as the china ones I had were too small or too large. This bowl is just the right size for a 4 person serving mixed salad. It is well made and is an attractive red on the outside. I have it sitting out on a niche in my kitchen; it is another red accent. I was impressed with the prompt delivery and the sturdy packaging too.
3,enhanced with guitar...,"It's ok if the guitar is playing in the background, but the guitar is not. It is playing in the foreground. So I can barely hear the nature sounds. Can't enjoy the nature sounds. I do enjoy the guitar though.If you like nature sounds with music on, you may like this Sampler. Includes 9 tracks, about 5 to 10 minutes each. The price is quite a bargain too.If I was looking for guitar CD, I would choose this one. The music is soothing and relaxing. However, I was expecting nature sounds ONLY when I ordered this sampler CD. Because of the guitar it gets only 3 stars. I heard Echoes of Nature's Sampler is not enhanced with music whatsoever. And the price is just nice.Don't you wish all environmental sound CDs come with bold and clear descriptions that say, ""Enhanced with music"" or ""Nature sounds ONLY""(that is, NOT enhanced with music)? That may spare us from unwanted spending and frustration. Guess thats what reviews are for.Thank you."
4,Lives up to its title,"This was a very strong read and provoked quite a bit of thought. Based on some solid research and with solid market comparisons, ""Good to Great"" helps highlight those traits that can make both a company and the people within it great.While I found some of the conclusion to be a bit over-simplified and derived from conventional wisdom, in general the book delivered the goods. Having just completed ""First, Break All the Rules"" (which I HIGHLY recommend) I was prepared to be disappointed with my next book selection. Instead I thought this matched ""First..."" very well in tone and information.If your interest is in learning what points of excellence seem to appear over and over in great companies (and how you might build the same into yours) I would highly recommend ""Good to Great."""
5,Good? Get ready for Greatness!,"This book is a must read, a must apply and a must practice if you know you have what it takes to walk in your greatness! I've suggested it to many of my workshop participants that range from single mother, high school administrator to corporate vice president. They paid it forward to others. Buy, apply and fly with this one!"
1,Don't believe the hype,"This book does its readers a tremendous disservice. I expect that statistics courses at Stanford Business School (where the author used to teach), like everywhere else, teach that correlation is not causality. This book, however, is a collection of correlations presented as having causal relationships. But wait - it gets worse. The gross selection bias throughout the book guarantees that the companies identified as ""great"" appear to be, while the so-called comparision companies give the illusion of a control group. Don't be fooled. This is pseudo-science couched in management-speak. Once you've seen through this silliness, you're left with little more than conventional wisdom about good management (do what you're passionate about, get the right people on board) that, while possibly true, is unsubstantiated by any of the ""data"" presented in the text.Managers, don't waste your valuable time. Don't waste your money. Don't reward authors who think you're stupid."
4,Good to Great is... Great!,"I read this book years ago, actually wrote an Executive Summary of it, and I still find it is helpful in my business life.The main concept I want to mention in this review is Collins' comment that you have to let go of what made you good if you want to be great. Yikes. Most of us have fear around that, especially in this economy. But, for those of us who DO want to be great - in whatever way - it's a super support to have Collins' book as a guide.Oh, I just read a new book, actually comes out on July 8 but is available on Amazon already,What's Your Body Telling You? Listening To Your Body's Signals to Stop Anxiety, Erase Self-Doubt and Achieve True Wellness. Steve is a buddy of mine, in fact I helped in the early stages of this book. It's also very practical and you get to use your body as a research center."
2,Seriously overrated padded book,"I got this book based on the rating and general popularity, but I was saddened to see it for what it really was, a padded out essay. The author repeats the whole ""good to great"" mantra in different ways over and over and over again to take up space, the few stories would make for a good essay length paper, but to fill a book he has to hammer the same point over and over again."
5,Still a Winner After a Decade!,"I recently re-read this iconic book and I think I learned more the second time through. A decade after it was released, Good to Great still packs a major punch for those looking to grow a different kind of company--one that stands far away from the crowd. Many small businesses struggle to break through the barrier and Collins uses case studies and real-life examples to show how other ""great"" companies were able to make if through while most don't. Business owners would do well to not only read this book, but also keep it nearby on their bookshelf, as the lessons are as timeless as they are powerful.Stefan SwanepoelAuthor:Surviving Your Serengeti: 7 Skills to Master Business and Life"
3,Great Insights: Long-Term Evidence lacking,Breifly: Good insights to improving a company; Time has exposed the truth to why the companies are great- many of them took on more debt than they could handle to increase the immediate profit.
5,A Must Own Book!,Mr. Collins and his research team did an amazing job with this book. I Love This Book. Please buy/rent/steal this book and read it and live by it.
4,Ok to Good,The book references years of research and then bases it view off of the authors observations. Worth the read but understand it has not been proven but rather interrupted.
4,"Buy the Book, Not the Audio CD!","Love this book. Its message is fairly straightforward and makes sense. Many have said that it's perhaps too simplistic, but if it were so easy to implement these strategies, more companies would be best in class.My only complaint, the author is absolutely annoying on the Audio CD. Great exaggeration, overemphasis on every topic. He sounds like a bad actor who is trying too hard. The unfortunate part is that the author is narrating the Audio CD, not someone else. He comes across a bit to self-absorbed and proud of himself, as if he discovered the Holy Grail. There is nothing wrong with being passionate about your work, but this guy needs to relax.He also needs a speech coach. Since when is Nazi pronounced ""nasi""? Buy the book and be forewarned that the Audio Book will have you hating this guy by the end and you'll forget his message."
1,Look at the results of the 'great' companies,"Let's see the results of these great companies...did they even keep up with the general market since this book was publish...no...not only that many are doing abysmally such as Circuit City and Fannie Mae. Even though Jim Collins stood firm against the idea of a 'new economy' and he wisely advocates against high-profile CEOs and golden parachutes, he didn't see the massive bubble that these companies were a part of and that attributed to their 'greatness'. The empirical analysis wasn't really empirical at all and failed to see the hidden assumptions in the research. I recommend potential buyers spend money on a good economics text or course, not on this overrated junk bond of a book."
2,Not the right way to correlate cause and effect,"This is one of those books that make a lot of success and I don't understand wy. As Daniel Kahneman points in his book ""Thinking fast and slow"", the right way to test cause and effect here would be to have a group of companies applying some practices while a control group does it differently. Based on those results you can get a clearer understanding of what has more chance of helping you / your company."
4,got for school,"I got this book for a college class on the Kindle...then I realized referencing is a bit difficult w/o page numbers. Hope Kindle soon gives the option to use pg. numbers and locations. If I put a magnifying glass on a paper book, the font size changed, but I am fully aware that I'm still on the same page and the book has not exponentially increased in paper."
3,Good Overview But A Little Dry and Monotonous,"Good to Great stands strong on its good research team. The book details eleven successful companies and their competitors. One main issue is that these successful companies thrived because of leaders who did not let adversity defeat them. They perservered without letting egos get in the way.Another point that Goods to Great makes lies in the steady periods of marketing their products. The great companies did not rely on the latest fads. Rather these companies relied on a business model that was modified due to changes in the conomy.The book does repeat itself in several chapters. To some degree its for emphasis and in other respects the wording just could be better. Smart yes, engaging not always. This could lose some audiences. However, the statistics and research give this summary on business conditions some strong merits."
1,Good to great to horrible,Fannie Mae was featured in the book Good To Great about 4 years ago. At the time the stock was trading at $70+. Seems like it went from good to great to horrible. Time for a new book.
5,Great,Two things I love about this book.1. It is bang on in terms of the things that matter to a tech startup2. It is short - half the book is methodology
4,Required Reading for New business owners,"I know a few business owners who desperately need this book. Collins points out what should be common sense but isn't: the key to corporate success is discipline. A company needs to take control of itself, its employees, and its resources and get everything moving in the same direction. Collins and his team engaged in an incredible amount of research, and manage to lay out the results in clear and concise dialogue. Instead of being full of catch phrases and feel good mantras like so many other so-called success books, Good to Great actually provides real information and practically step by step instructions on getting your company on track in a positive way."
5,Great Insights,"The insights offered are new and tremendous:- Why ""Level 5"" leaders are successful, why charismatic leaders often fail,- Getting the right people on the bus: starting with people, not strategy- The Stockdale paradox: facing the brutal realities yet steadfastly believing in your ability to succeed- The Hedgehog concept: becoming good at what you have a passion for, the skills to undertake and the economics for success- And much more...The fact that these insights were characteristic of ALL the great companies, and fewer than a third of the good comparison companies add even greater conviction to the findings. This will be required reading for our management team."
1,Zero Stars If I Could,"I don't want to waste another minute on this book, the author, or the lame brain catch phrases used within...READ THE ONE STAR REVIEWS, which exemplify the truth about this book, its principles, and its author."
3,"A Great Hook, Not A Great Book","The book is very well researched and reads very smoothly. At 210 pages, ""Good To Great: Why Some Companies Make The Leap and Others Don't"" reads very quickly. Jim Collins writes in a clear, concise style that uses effective analogies to get his points across. But I gained little from reading this book. The insights are good but not great, they are simply not new. The road to greatness according to Jim Collins is:1. Get the right people2. Set the right goals3. Execute relentlesslyThe data mining exercise that Jim Collins put his team through yielded few surprising results, and whatever useful lessons can be drawn from the exercise I can summarize in 10 pages. This is a deep quackery, another ""Who Moved My Cheese"" for people who spend all day in meetings trading consultant speak, thinking they're working and ""adding value""."
1,Discrimination against chileans,"I have been a customer of Amazon and Audible for many years. I have purchased many many books and audibooks since the 90s. Any way, as I live in Chile am beeing discriminated and I can't download some audiobooks. I wanted to buy this audiobook, but Amazon-Audible does not allow me to do it."
1,GREAT BOOK,"SINCE READING THIS BOOK, I'VE WANTED TO SEND A COPY TO 3 CEO'S OF COMPANIES I RECENTLY HAD BAD EXPERIENCES. THE PROBLEM IS I (THE CUSTOMER) WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO GET THIS BOOK TO THEM! THREE BAD EXPERIENCES WITH BIG COMPANIES AND IT IS NOW SO PLAIN TO ME THAT THE LEADER OF THESE COMPANIES NEED TO READ THIS BOOK. I THINK ABOUT THIS BOOK OFTEN WHILE RUNNING MY OWN COMPANY. IF YOU ARE A BUSINESS LEADER OR BUSINESS OWNER, I STRONGLY SUGGEST THIS BOOK!"
4,Almost Great...,"I really enjoy Jim's work and generally hold his thoughts and theories in high regard. This book will provide any reader with valuable advice that can be used to drive their business forward. That being said, I offer the following caution...leadership is contextual. In my bookLeadership Matters...The CEO Survival Manual: WHAT IT TAKES TO REACH THE C-SUITE AND STAY THEREI spend a decent amount of time discussing why one size fits all management recommendations can constitute extremely dangerous thinking. Categorizing certain ""types"" of leaders as effective and other ""types"" of leaders as ineffective is not only dangerous, but it is flat out wrong. Over the course of my career I have witnessed virtually every ""type"" of leader both succeed and fail. It is not the style of your leadership that matters, but rather the key issue is can you contextually, environmentally or situationally adapt your leadership skills to needs and demands of the time."
3,Successful Business Practices,"This book has generated so many successful business practices among my client base that who can genuinely put it down? As a companion to my own book, ""The Expert's Edge,"" it completes the picture for business success. Read it over and over and over!"
3,Good to Government Cheese,"Good to Government Cheese. Well, the jury is no longer out. What was thought to have worked 20 or 30 years ago may not be all it was cracked up to be. ""The bus"" analogy appears to have been a recipe for creating a completely narcissistic, homogenous company lacking the ability to see outside of their own contrived success. Can you say Logan's Run? Collins offers plenty of good advice however; I think we can all agree that the ""BEST"" people do not always create the best company. Simply throwing people off the bus is not necessarily change for the better."
4,"Good, but surprised no one is bothered by his reading style","Strong book...the positives are outlined by other reviews here. I will say though that his reading -the audio version is read by Jim Collins- has a bombastic tone, and it feels like he is making a 'hard sell' on the methodological rigor of his work and the subsequent ideas. I'm surprised I'm not seeing other reviewers note this. I find myself cringing at his rhetoric and having to force myself to be open minded to his ideas because I feel he is trying to shove them down my throat. By the 4th CD you get over it, and really appreciate some of the stronger points he makes. The concept of a Level 5 leader is great, although I sense a lot of us buy into this concept out of simple admiration for leaders with those characteristics. He leaves plenty of food for thought."
4,Excellent cd book,I am listening to this book for a college course and it is really helpful. It is wonderful to hear empirical findings to questions of how to create a great company from a good one. Easy to follow.
4,Good book but outdated,"Collins book ""Good to Great"" does deliver some very powerful messages him and his team have acquired over the period of their extensive research. However, some of the companies used in the book do not ""fit the mold"" as a good to great company for they are no longer really successful (i.e. Fannie Mae and Circuit City). I bought this book for a class so it was mandatory. Please keep the outdated info in the book in mind as you decide whether to purchase this book or not."
4,A good review of what makes a great leader,"This is a pretty good book if you're looking to determine directions that individuals can take in a company or organization to make it better. As in many books of these types, there is a style that gets a little repetitive. This style is a high-energy ""you-can-do-it"" style that sometimes gets old, but if you read the book for the messages imparted, then you will learn a lot."
3,"Good to Great, is a Book with a Small But Important Message.","The book is very good although not much info.Summery: Let only great people on the bus (your company payroll),stay humble, work hard, find out what you can do better then anyone and when you do keep that profit wheel turning(newtons law). Also don't expect great results in business unless you give it your all for 15 - 20 years. Hard labor and then die rich and humble, because level 5 leaders don't stand out.John HalloranCertified Gold Exchange, Inc"
1,"WHOOPS. After this analysis of Fannie Mae, how can you believe anything they say in this book?","WHOOPS. Check out this quote from the book: ""Fannie Mae grasped the subtle denominator of profit per mortgage *risk level*, not per mortgage (which would be the ""obvious"" choice). It's a brilliant insight. The real driver in Fannie Mae's economics is the ability to understand risk of default in a package of mortgages better than anyone else. Then it makes money selling insurance and managing the spread on that risk. Simple, insightful, unobvious--and right.""Oh except that it wasn't right. It was dead wrong. Fannie's ""brilliant insight"" represents the rampant irresponsibility that caused the financial crisis and literally broke the entire economy.So much for ""good"" to ""great"". How can you believe a book whose analysis was so apocalyptically wrong."
4,This book is excellent!,I read this book for a class and found it easy to read. Surprisingly we read this book in a graduate level education course. It was easy to make the connections from the business world to the strange world of education. Many of the ideas in this book can be applied to educational research and school reform research.
2,Jim Collins...Jim Collins...Jim Collins,"Let's get this straight...A level 5 leader ""...display(s) a compelling modesty..."" JC has his name imprinted on almost every even page in the book! Seems ""egoistic"" to me.To be great one needs a great leadera great staff anda great productClearly a ""no brainer"".Two million copies sold...I wonder how many of those helped to transform companies from ""good to great""?"
5,One of the best business books ever!,I think this book should be mandatory reading for all business leaders and those in company executive level management who are trying to grow their businesses. The examples are very interesting and logical. His research was intensive and thorough. His argument is compelling. I only wish that he'd update the book and let us know how the 'great' companies are doing now.
4,Great,"Jim Collins presents a compelling, and well-researched, set of thoughts and models in ""Good to Great"". This is a book for more than just individuals engaged in ""business""...it offers models that stimulate thought and highlight the importance of people in making the jump from simply good to just plain great.What I really like about this book is how the models and thoughts put forth are based upon evidence. Evidence...and the statistics that often flow from such evidence...can be seen in a variety of ways, but Collins provides a clear presentation of how he and his team arrived at their conclusions.This is a book for those interested in a thorough set of thoughts and models on how to move from good to great."
4,Great book! I highly recommend it.,"The book is great and provides rational insights into how business can be successful. Very factual based and well researched. It is an extremely interesting read. It has many pearls of information, but no diamonds. For diamonds, look at the strategy and tactics of pricing."
5,Full Service Maintenance implimentation,"Hello,I'm in charge of a large Maintenance organisation and my challenge 9 months ago was to take the business to the next level of sustainability.I used this book as guideline to choose my Lead Team of 12 people (Right People). My business coach/facilitator and I took the learning's and transformed it into the Good to Great Maintenance concept of developing a 3 year Maintenance Strategy by means of following the hedgehog concept, however we are still working on this and my Lead Team and I are meeting every Wednesday morning for 2 hours for the next 6 weeks.Thus, we have started to move the old big flywheel and already I can see change in behaviour in the workforce and my union members.The process is not about change, but instead of evolving into something great without anyone knowing it.Give me 1 year and I would be able to share more results - my ""gutt"" is telling me that this is the right way if you want to have a Constructive Workforce!"
2,Good to Great; not that great,"I'm about ten to fifteen percent of the way through the book. I intend to finish it, although it will be painful.I believe that there are some good nuggets of information in this book, and anyone who runs a business or intends to do so will benefit from the information in the book. However, between those valuable nuggets exists extravagant fluff, repetition, and flowery language.The book could probably be more effective at half the size. As you read, I would suggest that you skim, paying attention to mostly thesis statements, and final conclusions. Everything in between is not worth much at all."
4,Good not great,"Overall enjoyed the book. It was well written and well structured. The book title says it all, basically the book discusses the differences between large decent companies to great large companies. Decent read but not what I need at my stage in my career."
4,Good fundamentals,Great fundamentals to help any business owner or entrepreneur. It's definitely on the top 10 list of must read business books.
4,Good to Great: Why some companies Make the Leap... Others Don't,Excellent book and down to earth information
3,Good to more than good,"I love the success story case studies in this book. These types of stories were always my favorite in school. But let the buyer beware: this book is best for those who can not only appreciate a good success story, but also APPLY base principles to their own companies.Often, this doesn't work so well for those who are lower on the totem pole. Nothing against hearing about the best of the best. But the most difficult challenge lies in understanding that these are the stories of what worked for these companies - not yours. Each business must find very specific changes to make in order to truly move itself ""from good to great."""
3,What's the big deal,"I've heard so much about this book that I had very high expectations. Unfortunately, I can't see what all the hoopla is all about. It's very long for just a few important concepts. The use of ""research"" to ""prove"" his theory is somewhat helpful, although I'm sure there are those who could refute his methodology. I found Mr. Collins' style of narration very distracting and difficult to withstand. I wish he had used someone else to narrate his book. Well I guess anyone interested in leadership and executive training still has to read this stuff. Don't read or listen late at night if you want to get through it, unless you need a book to go to sleep by."
4,Not Life Changing But Quite Enjoyable,"Reading the book and then listening to the audio CDs is a grand way to get the most from the material. Actually, I enjoyed the audio after reading the book gaining mental confirmations. Good to Great, in my judgment, is motivational and inspiring to the extent that it provides the reader (and listener to audio) new ideas to apply. It will probably not help me become a billionaire in the next few months or even years. Yet the principles and analysis of the human leaders of the corporations was enlightening and enjoyable. To me, Good to Great, was a modern day Napoleon Hill effort to identify ""Keys to Success."" I will listen to the audio again as I travel from time-to-time so it was worth the investment."
4,Good to great is a great book,I really do not understand the sub five star let alone the 1 star reviews. This is a great book. A lot of time and research was done to find what separates the good from the great companies. I can only assume that sub 5 star reviewers own businesses that are doing doing that great or are not in business at all...anymore.Great book for those who want to learn how to take your business to that next level. The level of greatness.
3,Okay,"What a big and slow book! Very systematical, easy-to-understand, but only borderline inspiring. The message is good, but can be equally well-explained with a big chart - I'd rather have a Sparknotes version of the book in a paperback manual format."
3,Good not great,"I bought this book because an organization I am involved with is using the G-to-G framework to focus its activities. Although the point of view is interesting, I think the contents of the book tend toward the superficial. They are indicative of an academic perspective lacking real world experience. The fact that a few years later some of these ""great' companies are struggling or bankrupt further reduces any confidence in this particular paradigm."
3,good to great,"The book was helpful in my business. I have a small device called the Shoe Odometer, it's like a pedometer worn on your shoes that measures steps and it also tell runners their shoe wear. This book helped me decide how to think of my product in a different way. I'm now focusing on what I can do for my customers instead of what the Shoe Odometer was going to do for them.I received the book promptly and was very happy with the service of the seller.Rick ClearyShoe Odometer"
3,Good but not great,"The best part of the book is that it is based on an empirical study looking at comparisons with companies that did not make the leap. As with most business books, it is light on real implementable action items.Collins has a bad habit of going off on tangents or unnecessary detail rather than sticking to the crux of his point. He repeats the same points over and over beyond the necessity for emphasis. There's a huge amount of padding to get it to exactly 300 pages. A good editor would have cut the padding and set out its solid content in a crisp manner.Other than that, it is written in clear, understandable language and avoids cheap clichés and pop sound bites."
2,Take with a grain (or more) of salt,I found it to be like most business success books - some interesting concepts but relies on catch phrases and fortune cookie twists on common factors needed for success. Take a look at the current state of the success stories and consider the explanations offered by the author in the book. To me it's really a leadership/teamwork/inspirational book but there are bettter books out there for those topics.Check it out for yourself.
4,Leos Love Business,I had to read this book for a management class and discovered that it was an easy read with a lot of interesting examples of real-world organizations and the methods that they used to become renowned organizations.
5,The right seat/direction,"This book does a good job illustrating the differentiating points of the best to poorest run companies. Providing concepts that are easily grasped and presented with full authority. To be in the right seat and direction this book is a great read for leaders to bring companies to the next level. Brett Vanderwater, MBA, CIA, CMA, CTP"
1,Not Great At All,"This book continues to be published and sold, yet after reading it I cannot imagine why? A sizable portion of the companies that Collins claims have made the move to being Great are now on the ash heap of life; Circuit City, Fannie Mae which gave us the housing disaster we are now living through. He proclaims how great a company Walgreens is and while they made a move to become the McDonalds of the neighborhood pharmacy world; it is chain that provides NO CUSTOMER SERVICE, I know because I travel coast to coast and unfortunately have to rely on them from time to time. If Collins who claims to be such a student of business were truly so, he would write a sequel where he revisits the companies he claims in this book are so great and set the record straing. This is the rare case where I have read a book that has such little value. Please save your money and time."
3,Defintely suboptimal thinking here!,"In an era where companies have turned to Optimal Thinking, this suboptimal thinking paradigm is outdated. Good companies are created by mediocre positive thinkers, great companies are created by extraordinarily positive thinkers, and optimized companies, by Optimal Thinking. Save your time and money and get a copy of Optimal Thinking-How To Be Your Best Self, optimize your mission statement, get all your people educated in the consistent use of Optimal Thinking, and you will have a company of optimizers, focusing on optimal results in every situation."
2,Does not stand the test of time.,"Collins takes a series of anecdotes and tries to get some sort of long term and extensive theory from them. Unfortunately, many of the companies he praises have turned out in practice to not be great, such as Circuit City who he praises in a chapter on why having good people is better then having a good plan but who have now unfortunately had a bankruptcy caused largely by problems with their core business model."
1,please burn every copy you can find,"Please google critical review of G2G before reading. There are major problems with the ""research"" presented. Check out Nassim Nicholas Taleb's ""The Black Swan"" for some insight into what really makes a company great. The answer; no one really knows. It's all random.Business books are nothing but fads and fashion. Read, borrow a couple of ideas, then throw them in the trash when you are done. G2G became required reading where I work and in my view has nearly destroyed the company. It was, and still is, considered the Gospel of business. Prior to G2G we grew from zero to $120M in 10 years. In the 7 years after G2G we are down to $60M. (Still profitable, thankfully, but boring.) Life was much more fun before we got hedge-hogged.Avoid at all costs, unless you are a fox and read it to learn what the hedge hogs are thinking."
3,Needed for Class,"This is a good book, however, I bought it electronically. If I purchased the actual hard copy I would be selling this one back to Amazon."
1,Fluff,I can save you the cost of this book:Companies become great because they figure out who is making money for the company and work hard to keep those people happy. If those people become unhappy they leave and are replaced by second rate employees who at best 'keep things afloat'.Such as the fall of Fairchild and the Rise of Intel.
1,One more person selling jargon ...,"rather then real insight and ideas.WARNING: Those who gave this book more then 2 stars are the same same business people who made ""Who Moved My Cheese"" a best seller."
1,Plenty of Business Owners followed the same ideas and went BANKRUPT,"in this book you will find a long blablabla about some succesfull companies.problem is that many other companies, plenty of them and plenty of Business Owners followed the same ideas and went BANKRUPTbut this book doesnt say about them.just hype here... a reason to waste time and money:("
2,The fundamentals of business never change but,"Sorry, if I know anything about business it's that going from bad to ok or ok to good is a much better return and far more likely than going from good to great. If you want to know something about being personally responsible for greatness then try reading Rockefeller's The difficult art of getting."
3,Mediocre at best,"After many years of ignoring the hype about this book (it admittedly has a great name) I buckled and read it. It was o.k. I did find some useful facts and anecdotes in it but for the most part it reminded me of esoteric research papers that I was forced to read in med school and residency -- crammed with #'s and statistics and graphs, but relatively little in the way of real-life applicable insights. Worth a quick perusal. The books by Trout and Ries are much better."
4,Great leadership insight,This book outlined many areas of leadership especially in the area of discipline which I find the most telling. His matrix of creative discipline is particularly insightful for anyone looking to improve their leadership skills in a team environment.
5,Great book on how to focus a Company or Team,This is one of the best business books I've ever read. It shows very successful ways for a company (or team) to:a. Determine what it does best.b. Shape that skill into a successful business model.b. And then focus the organization's efforts behind that effort.This book demonstrates how this works well by giving examples of companies that have succeeded or failed in the past.
4,Essential Reading for Business Leaders,"Although it was often repetitive, the scope of the research is worthy of reading. There is so much that combats conventional wisdom about ""what makes a great company"" that you're constantly hoping for the next big surprise. I love reading business biographies, and this has a number of associated stories throughout. You learn about the companies that ""look good"" yet aren't nearly as profitable as other, more understated companies. You realize that the big offices and powerful motivational seminars aren't worth much. In fact, you'll end up treating them as counterproductive.Just hearing that what makes a successful company is based on a continual ""turning of the wheel"" is important to reiterate. It takes great leaders who are looking for a long-term commitment to the success of their organization. -SG"
5,"Interesting book, very insightful","I bought this book because a potential employer recommended that I read it. His company follows the Good to Great doctrine closely. He is a very engaging man with humble beginnings, but who has risen high without losing his humility. This book is mostly about people, particularly the RIGHT people, and how they make a company great. I now know why he had me read it; so I could answer the question: ""Am I the right person for this company?"" Fortunately for all of us, reading the book only made it more clear that I was. I highly recommend this book to anyone who is curious about how good companies become great, and stay great. You may be surprised by what you learn!"
3,Good at Myth-Busting...,"I appreciate the scientific approach that the author used to determine what really works in successful businesses. I thought the myth-busting - my words, not his - was interesting and useful. However, I can't say that I was able to apply much of it to my own business. This is mostly due to the fact that I am a part of a very small startup company. The descriptions are a bit abstract like most formal business books and I don't like that about it. Overall, it's worth a few listens."
5,G to G hits a home run,"Hallelujah - someone decided to drill down and understand the real reasons companies become great, instead of listening to the overblown hype of egocentric CEO's. Thank you Mr. Collins."
5,How to go from good to great,"I like the way 'Good to Great' outlines many corporate leadership attributes, especially discipline, which is rare these days. I can honestly say Mr Collins' book is helping my company go from OK-ordinary-good to great, as shown by our bottom line. Lately, I picked up the book by Norman Thomas Remick, '..Going Beyond Leadership of Character..', and I can honestly say it is already helping me, personally, to grow as a leader, and is the 'Good to Great' counterpart dealing, not with taking a business or corporation from OK-ordinary-good to great, but taking an individual from good to great in leadership. The Collins book is obviously the gold standard for companies, the Remick book is the new guy on the block for ambitious leaders of character."
4,Walking down memory lane,"Having been born in the 1950s, this was a fascinating read about companies that I remember growing up with, and seeing how the leadership in these companies succeeded or failed. It is a very interesting read, with applications that could be made to leadership in any genre. Worth the time to read."
2,Historical data does not compute always for current companie,"The number 1 fallacy is if a dog is brown, a cat is brown, therefore a cat is a dog. Similar to the same train of thought, Good to Great presents the same formula-based approach of dissecting historical data of successful companies, without understanding just how companies not only operate at the macro level, much of their successes or failures can result at the micro level too. Rather superficial and flawed arguments. Try more balanced approaches without hyperbole, like The Art of Happiness at Work or the new book Dot Zen."
2,I couldn't even finish the book,"Its outdated, its provides small amounts of good information buried in pages and pages of ""bla bla bla."" I honestly do not know how it got into any best sellers list. The writing is exceptionally boring and inefficient. Get to the points already!! I liken this book to be dragged by a horse on the end of a rope. I'd like to call it From Boring to Sleepy.I know this is not a ""professional"" book review, but 1) I couldn't finish the damn thing 2) Im not a ""professional"" book reviewer (I have a life thank you), and 3) someone out there is similar to me and will get the jest of what I am saying."
4,"AnneMiller, Author,Metaphorically Selling",Gets at the real reasons why companies make it. Lessons galore for those who want to see their own organizations thrive.
4,Just started and love it!,I read A LOT of motivational stuff and this is an excellent and inspiring book if you are in business or starting a business. I am so grateful that it is based on study and facts.
5,Good to Great is... Great,"Good to Great is solid and is based on researching why companies make the step from the norm to the exceptional. There are terrific examples of companies pinpointing both ""how"" and ""what"" the leadership did to take the businesses to the next level. Want to learn something about running a business? Read Good to Great."
4,Good for those who work in an organization. Great for those in a group.,"Good to Great is informed by significant research and data. Its premise is that through leadership, good organizations can become great organizations. Through Good to Great Collins distinguishes six key competencies that lead to business success: Level 5 Leadership, First Who Then What, Confront the Brutal Facts, Hedgehog Concept, Culture of Discipline, and the Flywheel. The substantive data, gathered from CEO surveys, stock indexes, and other statistics, support the six competency claims and lay the foundation of Collins' leadership philosophy. I highly recommend Good to Great. It is a book geared towards business people in organizations and not necessarily a leadership ""how to"" book."
3,Alot of rehash but some great ideas,"After reading hundred of books in this genre, I've come to expect some rehashing of ideas which was no different this time around. Collins has some great ideas about building lasting businesses but most of it is very theoretical like what you learned when you were 21 in physics class at college...hey that's nice but will I ever use more than 10% of that it in the real world?One outstanding chapter which only a few companies use: Hire your employees based on ABILITY not EXPERIENCE. A 23 yr old genius with great work ethic who is undiscovered or underappreciated, is better than a 45 yr old veteran of the industry who wants a salary + benefits position looking to produce adequate results. You don't need to hire people with experience if you hire people that can and want to learn, who will cross the boundaries of their position and develope along with your company. Best chapter in the book, shame that most companies don't use the advice."
1,Horrible,"Personally, I think this is a horrible book. The companies he picks are terrible and his only focus is on financial return to stockholders, nothing about how the companies are when it comes to corporate responsibility. Even that being said, many of the companies he picks have ended up not doing so well or have even gone out of business. If you think the only thing that makes a company good is its ability to provide a high stock price for its investors, even if only for a short period of time, then you might enjoy this book. However; if you think a company has a responsibility to be a good citizen in the communities they do business and have an obligation to treat their employees and customers with respect then you will probably think this book is trash as I did."
2,Hard to read but good,"Hard to read,little dry but good information. It was hard to pick back up. But once I did I could stay with it for the information."
4,Interesting read,"The author presents an interesting take on management style, highlighting the importance of things like knowing your economic drivers and the place for humility in the business world. However, I think with the pace at which business changes, by the time that any idea is able to be published, you're probably already six months behind the curve."
4,An interesting read,"Let me say the author makes for a fast and amusing read. Some points that are brought out are interesting and will give you a moment for pause to think. If you work for a company you will immediately begin to size up your company and how it performs against the many concepts in the book.You will immediately begin to see if your leader has what it takes to be a level 5 leader, if he can truly follow the stockdale principle, and if your company is disciplined enough to only what they do best with the hedgehog concept.Most companies will never make this book, many have shortcomings that with some revamping their thought process they could improve in all areas, but it takes courage to move into this transition.I have found the book to be very insightful and a springboard for further study of companies, their leaders, and their strategic policies."
5,Challenge to be Passionate,"Working in Church leadership, I found Mr. Miller and team's work challenging and appealing. What seems obvious in being great is actually the antithesis of 'conistent greatness'. I would recommend this book for any organization. A+ for those of us in ministry!"
5,"A ""Must Read"" for any Small Biz Owner","This is an Excellent Book & a must read for any small to medium size business owner's, especially those with an established business looking to get to the next level. Jim Collins & his team did an excellent job of pinpointing the key ingredients for turning a ""Good Biz"" into a ""Great Biz"". A very insightful and thought-provoking book, which has turned into a text-book for us to implement in our day-to-day business & Weekly Staff Meetings...I also recommend the ""Audio Version"" of the book, to hear the words directly from Jim Collins."
1,"Flawed research, flawed analysis, flawed recommendations","The thesis of this book is that companies led by ""Level 5 Leaders"" outperform companies led by more egocentric leaders over long periods of time, and they continue to succeed after the departure of the Level 5 leader. Unfortunately, as other reviewers have pointed out, all the companies held out by the author as being the kind with enduring success have pretty much all underperformed the market since the publication of the book. This is a result of flawed statistics, too short of an analysis period, and generally silly conclusions. Don't waste your money on this book."
3,Good but simple; fraught with self-importance,"Classic academic approach, which yielded a variety of not-so surprising results. Thankfully, Collins takes many opportunities to lambast corporate over-indulgence and egotistical ""leaders"". The piece of Level 5 leadership is fantastic and actionable. Anyone surprised by these revelations; however, needs a stronger grounding in reality.My strongest gripe with the book is Collins' pervasive, self-serving narrative. Too much effort is spent justifying (and promoting) his scientific analysis process. Every other page describes ""debates among the team, that went on for weeks"" with regards to the data. He also falls into the trap of most academics - trying to create the next buzzword - going to the extent of providing Webster-style pronounciation clues for his self-proclaimed acronyms (BHAGs). The book is fraught with catchy, yet silly lexicon: The Hedgehog Concept (also known as focus), Rinsing your Cottage Cheese (also known as details), blah blah blah."
1,The worst example of a best seller,"looking at circuit city, fannie mae and most of his case studies makes this by far the worst best seller in the world today.case studies aside, there's too much generalization and awful statistical representation. for example, einstein was called a hedgehog thinker. hahait's a poor book, little substance, good title and great marketing buzz."
2,Nowhere near great.,"If being obsessive-compulsive about one thing is a prerequisite to greatness, I'm going to start feeling much better about mediocrity."
4,Excellent book but I have learned all this from Peter Drucker,This book is a must-have but only because it is a concise summary of a much more detailed work by Peter Drucker.
5,Wonderful book that asks the right questions,"This is a wonderful book that has any business owner or organization ask itself the right questions. At first I wasn't sure if it applied to me, being that I have a very small business and assumed that maybe this book was written about and for major companies.While it does profile major companies to make its case, this book applies to any business owner anywhere - from a single-shingle contractor to an international conglomerate. It's had me ask myself the right questions, and has nudged me away from repeating the same mistakes, and towards identifying what I could really excell at and aiming to be the best I can possibly be in my area of expertise.Though it does aim ait big organizations, it's a perfect book to help anyone identify some basic principles of success, in business and in life."
3,I would have given this book 4 stars...,"But I heard the audio version - it was monotonous and repetitive, nothing to justify 8 CDs. His team has clearly gone through a lot of data. The book version is way better (I'd still say it's too long and repetitive), and the illustrations and tables make it more interesting and intelligible. He should have supplied a PDF with the same illustrations and tables."
5,good to great audio version,"very good, read by the author and he gives extra incites to the data that he presents that you would not get if you just read the book. It wood be nice if it was read a little faster, but it was a great buy."
5,A Must Read,"It doesn't matter what you do for a living, this book is for you. It's easily one of the best three books I've ever read, hands down."
4,Well Worth the Time,"While some may say that the Collin's Team has rediscovered the obvious, I don't agree. This is a very readable book and it reinforces solid concepts about the need for focus, clarity, persistence and principled leadership."
4,Data based observations on why companies are great,"If you are at any senior management level, this book should be sitting on your desk right now.As a follow up to Build to last, this book goes one step future and tells you 'what' Great companies did that made them great. These observations are not based on options, but by collected data and then 'trends' derived from the data. You'll be surprised at some of the findings, but anyone who has any 'real life' hardened business experience will see how invaluable this book is.I've known senior managers who have bought a copy of this book for their own middle management and have noticed how things changed for the better afterwards.Get this book, it will open your eyes to some home truths."
1,One star because I cannot give it ZERO,"I cannot believe anybody in their right mind is still buying this book. Collins' analysis was flawed from the outset when it was published in 2001 and 11 years later it has proven to be a failure. Four of his so called ""GREAT"" companies are Fannie Mae (mortgage scandal), Circuit City (declared bankruptcy), Wells Fargo ($25B bailout) and Gillette (bought by Proctor & Gamble). See a pattern? Great, huh?So much for Good to Great. Didn't anybody learn from his ""Built to Last"" book when most of the companies touted in that book did NOT last? Wake up people. Jim Collins' goal was to put YOUR money in HIS pocket. He feels GREAT about that.You better hope Jim Collins never puts a company you work for in one of his books. If he does, start looking for another job quick."
3,Slightly disappointed,"I recently changed positions and am no longer in a managerial role but was looking for a little inspiration. I was hoping by the early pages in the book that this was the book for me. Early on, the authors state that you do not have to be a manager to be a leader but the majority of the references within the book were made for those that have staff reporting directly to them. However, it was an easy read and I still walked away with a few items that may be of reference later."
3,Good book,"This book is an easy read. I read it in one weekend. Interesting perspecive for anyone in business and a great followup to Build to Last.Another book I highly recommend for anyone in business is Customers come Second, Employees comes first"" a philosophy that I have alwys implemented in my business."
1,"Terrible Business Book, Awful statistics,","This was one of the worst business books I've ever read becuase it passes off ungodly bad statistics as academic research. The entire book is based on false assumptions and classic statistical errors, such as Correlation does NOT equal Causation and survivorship bias.PLEASE do not buy this book, it offers you nothing and will fill your head with hatred for the author who claims to know what he's doing."
4,Interesting to read. But are there really golden rules ?,"The book was centred on a research project to identify good-to-great companies (among Fortune 500) and their success factors. The research methodology was sound, while not too complicated to understand. There were good cases as examples, from both good-to-great examples and comparisons. These made the ideas and findings more convincing - although some of them may just ¡common sense¡ to you.Author did a good job to conceptualize the findings. He raised some challenges to nowadays business norms. The book is easy to read.But one can¡t help questioning: are there really golden rules to be successful in the diverse and dynamic world ? Besides, it is easy to talk, but hard to do with these so-called ¡golden rules¡. The author did too much preaching in the last part of the book to hard sell his ¡Built-to-Last¡ and ¡Great-to-Good¡ principles."
2,"Close to Good, Far from Great","It was an easy read, but you can only take little from this book. I know a lot of people put a lot of stock in this book and attempt to model organizations after this teaching, so I decided to read it. I was let down quite a bit. Most of the highlights were obvious(i.e. surround yourself with good people, grow a company slowly), and a lot of them I didn't agree with. I felt like most of the time they would have an idea and mold their research findings to support their preconceived notions. As I read the book I kept shaking my head and thinking that their findings could be the result of other factors that weren't touched on. This book was not worth the read. They obviousely had business ideas and principles, then set out to find research that would support it, and discard any that wouldn't support it."
5,Why what you know about business may be completely wrong!,"Jim Collins and his team have done a tremendous service to business by publishing this book. Not simple a droning serious take on how to manage, this book shows that some times it really is hard work, consistent performance, and ethical behavior that leads to success. And surprisingly, it's not celebrity, or crankiness, or ""willingness to take risks"" (read that as: ""willingness to break the law"") that wins the long term race for success. It seems jaded to say ""everything you've heard about business leadership is wrong"", but Jim has the data to support that supposition. Every executive should read (and listen to the audio version of) this book... So should the people who work for them. If you've already suffered through the cartoonish ""Who moved my Cheese?"" or scary near-fascism of ""Execution: The Art of Getting Things Done"", this book is a breath of fresh air! Well-worth it's best-selling ranking!"
2,Data-mining Project,"I gained little from reading this book. The data mining exercise that Jim Collins put his team through yielded few surprising results, and whatever useful lessons that can be drawn from the exercise can be summarised in 10 pages. But Collins had to write a book about it!"
5,a must read,"If you haven't read Built to Last, you've heard ideas from it...they've been all over since that one was published, they are too good to resist.This is at least as good. Out of the 20 smartest executives I have worked with, in three major companies this year, probably 15 have dropped references to it in our conversation."
2,Not so good,"Collins and his team, by their own admission, picked a handful of companies that fit into their very specific criteria, then lo-and-behold those companies all had the same characteristics?!?!?The nature of the study even admits that most of the time, someone on the inside of a company cannot see the bigger picture going on - the very same bigger picture that you need to see in order to achieve Good To Great success. Collins then concedes that the only way you can tell you're on the right track is when it's all said and done.Don't waste your money on this.The lessons of this book can fairly be summarized in about 2 pages."
5,Research-Based Principles for Success,"I don't work in a big corporation... I run my own business. Yet, I am a student and raving fan of Jim Collins' corporate studies. I'll tell you why.The previous book, ""Built to Last,"" was good, but as Jim explains in his preface, people still didn't know how to get there from here.I admire two things in particular about Collins' work.1. He demonstrates good leadership by humbly acknowledging his team. He even includes a picture of them!2. The team's passion for research brings us closer to a scientific explanation of corporate success.The principles they discovered can be applied to big companies, or to individuals. Big or small, you can benefit from this book.Last point- Bring a pen and paper. This book'll give you enough ideas for the rest of the year."
2,Interesting concepts but still just metephors,"While it had some interesting metephors, it still depends on that and buzz words as its primary messege. I didn't really dislike it, but another book called Managing Transitions is one that dosn't depend on the latest buz and calls it like it is."
4,Solid from start to finish,"Solid content from start to finish. This book has great points and backs them up. If you want to make a difference in any sort of large organization, read this book."
3,Important book in its field,"Well researched. An important book in its field. Very interesting because of its counter-intuitive ideas. However, it's another one of those books that seems to think the masses can learn something helpful from the exceptions."
3,Something Not Quite Right,"I bought the book after seeing him on PBS. I must say I am a little diappointed. I was really hoping for some deep insight and inspiration. Instead I read about a bunch of research from newspaper clippings by some research students.Collins has some great concepts Level 5 Leaders and the ""Stockdale Principle"" and then some things to turn on the eclectic filter as you read.Find or steal one of Tom Peters books on Excellence - Before you read this"
3,Is this the best we can do?,"Good to Great examines the transition from mediocre corporate performance to extraordinary performance. Whilst the research contained within this best-selling book is excellent, I found myself using Optimal Thinking and asking ""Is this the best we can do?""In my industry, companies strive to be their best and are not satisfied with being great. Read Optimal Thinking: How to Be Your Best Self by Dr. Rosalene Glickman if you want to OPTIMIZE the thinking and performance of your people and your company."
5,fantastic perspective on business today,"this rates as one of the best management books I have ever read. Simple, doable and repeatable.Don't read it if you are happy and complacent and comfortable in your job."
1,One of the worst books ever!,"This may very well be the worst business book ever written. Its advice has duped low level corporate leaders to ""think"" that they are level 5 and do all sorts of stupid things to a company and its employees, ultimately shrinking their market share, concentrating their business risk, and making them vulnerable to a serious setback if even one bad thing happens. It has ruined the lives of its most promising talent, by having subpar management decide who should be on or off the bus, and should be avoided at all costs. Don't read it. Burn it."
5,Still applicable in 2007,"I enjoyed the thought provoking aspect of this book. The different levels of leadership, the hedgehog concept are the two takeaways from this book.How many of us fall into the trap of being everything to everyone? Most I suspect from the findings presented in the book.Read this book to find out how you can strive to be a Level 5 leader. I found the book very insightful. Jim Collins and his team hit a homerun!"
1,Painfully dull.,"The Ghosts that haunt me is one of my favorite CD's, the creative blending of musical styles and humorous lyrics make it a rare album. I'm not sure if the lyrics are any good on Worm because the music is so godawfully tedious that this is one of the most disappointing albums I've ever come across. There is a book by Mark Helprin where a thief steals several very expensive paintings from a museum and then breaks back in to returns them because they have no color and look like they are made of mud. Enough said."
5,This Worm Rocks,"I think this is an under-rated and under-appreciated album by some. It may be my favorite CTD effort, as it conbines their great tune-making ability and whimsical lyrics with some great guitar licks and high energy. Different from the kind of energy displayed on Give Yourself a Hand, which seems more frenetic at times, this album is a great mix of their musical styles, with the guitar as the focal instrument.It never fails to please each and every time I listen to it."
1,GLAD I DIDN'T BUY IT,I borrowed this disc from the library. This is a HORRIBLE CD. I love the CTD but these tunes made me cringe! Like the difference between margarine and butter. I recommend give it a pass. Margarine is bad for you.
2,Brad Roberts should stick to what he does best,"This is the first CTD album produced by band members. It shows. The melodies and words that made the first two albums worth repeated listening are hidden behind a needless attempt to add 'edge', 'a raw sound', or 'energy'. I've heard Roberts discuss (after the first albums) how his live shows had a harder edge, and it seems that he felt that this would translate well into this album. My advice: let a professional who understands the nature of studio recording produce the work, and save the 'edge' for the concerts, where energy counts for much more."
3,Grows on you like foot fungus,"I have to admit, I did not like this album when I first heard it. I felt kind of betrayed from CTD's previous albums. But in the spirit of creativity I applaud them. They have deviated from the style and form that gave them national recognition. That takes guts. This album will be a disappointment to anyone who liked and are stuck to catorgorizing CTD in a ""style"" of music. I have enjoyed listening to them evolve and have grown to like this disc. This disc is a must for any die hard fan, but if you are new to CTD shy away from this one till you have heard their other three discs."
1,Bad Investment,"I never could get into this CD, I suppose I'll trade it in or give it to someone else. Disappointing after I had enjoyed thier previous CD."
1,"No Good, No Good!","I love the first two CTD cds. I also like the new cd, ""Give Yourself A Hand"", but this third cd was reallly no good. A lot of the fans like it better than their lastest cd, ""Give Yourself A Hand"", but I don't. I think its boring and just isn't the dummies I love!"
4,This book quickly became a family favorite.,"I gave this book to my almost-five-year-old son a month ago and he now has nearly every page memorized. I love listening to him recite that, ""the sundial was telling him it was suppertime. The table creaked with all his favorite foods - salty, spicy, sugary, sharp, hot and cold and fizzy."" He now wants me to make a cloth of dreams for him! I highly recommend this book."
5,This product works for me and saves me $$$$,I do not have regular bowel movements and had been spending about $100.00 or more a month @ the Vitamin Shoppe so I could have regular bowel movements. I ran across this tea accidently and realized how it has helped me tremendously. I have also lost 30 #'s. This is an awsome product and can not live with out it. Thanks alot.
3,wow!!! This is strong stuff: be careful,"I ordered this in the hopes of finding a tea that would be healthy and help me lose weight. I drank one cup in the afternoon and spent 5 hours of the night in the bathroom. This was not a comfortable experience. I finally thought it might be easier to diet than endure the consequences of this tea. Nevertheless, it did help relieve my water retention. In the future, I think I'd sip it in its diluted form only on an as need basis. Sienna the herb is also not good longterm. It a purging herb that your digestive system gets used to and then you need more and more just to avoid getting constipated."
3,HARLEY HEADSET HURTS,"The Harley Davidson 426306 Digital Headphone Radio is only OK. Two things are not so good. One is that I can not seem to get a comfortable fit over my ears. Too much pressure even though I adjust the headband. Secondly, the Power On/Off switch is too easily turned On/Off. When I toss it in my gym bag, then the next day get it out, the power has been on all day/night. So I waste alot of batteries. Just don't think it should be so easy to power off."
2,Didn't work,"This would have been a great item had it worked. Only one speaker worked on it. Otherwise, the sound quality was great. I am sending it in for a return, hopefully the next one will work."
1,Harley Davidson 426306 digital headphone radio,"Have had several problem with this product,broken head ban,only one side volume at times, this is the second unit i have gotten and volume works the same as the previous one.Would not recommend this unit."
1,Harley Davidson Headphone Radio,Very nice looking product. Like the ability to have preset stations on a headphone. The biggest drawback of the product is the antenna. Even on our stongest station reception is poor unless you face the right direction. This is in the city where the reception should be the strongest.
1,POOR,I HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO OPEN THE BATTERY COMPARTMENT EASILYSINCE THE FIRST DAY I RECEIVED THE RADIO. THE PROCEDURE ISTO PUSH DOWN ON IT AND IT IS SUPPOSED TO POP OPEN. I DOES NOTPOP OPEN. I HAVE TO PRY IT UP WITH A KNIFE TO OPEN IT. RIGHTI HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO OPEN IT TO CHANGE BATTERIES.TRULY GEORGE FITZGIBBONS
1,Digital Headphone Radio,This radio is a piece of junk...never worked at all. Don't waste your money.
1,Misleading ship date from Foot Locker,"Although listing the specific model as shipping in 1-2 business days, the order confirmation stated two weeks. That is simple ""bait and switch"". This hurts Amazon's as well as Fott Locker's reputation.For us, the delay precluded having it for the trip we had targeted. Another Amazon-partner might have gotten it to us in time."
1,"A Pompous, Pretentious Tone Throughout - Not Recommended","I thought I would have a good read about the ups and downs of a flight attendant in the ""good old days"" of flying, including funny anecdotes and perhaps a harrowing story or two. Not so. Instead the author comes across as a pretentious and bitter employee with a condescending, ""holier than thou"" attitude toward other crew members and passengers who didn't meet up to her ""superior"" standards. She categorizes fellow flight attendants, passengers and crew into neat little cylinders of critical judgement, headed up by titles such as the disillusioned ones, the lazy ones, the zealous ones, the subservient ones, and the tacky tarts. Overall, I found the book to be an unpleasant read - one I would not recommend to others. (Instead, consider ""Footsteps in the Sky,"" by Helen E. McLaughlin, which provides a much more enjoyable read of the life of flight attendants in the ""good old days."")"
4,An enjoyable glimpse into life as a Pan Am Stewardess,"This book is a great read if you want a realistic glimpse into what it was like to be a Pan Am stewardess back in the golden days. Having been a flight attendant in the past 5 years, I could identify with much of what the author was writing about. Of course things have changed now but it was great to have a first hand insight about what it was like to do the job back when flying was glamorous!"
5,Wonderful reading.,"My father was a mechanic with Pan Am from the 40's to the late 70's when he retired. I didn't realize all the glorious history of this great airline until I read this great book by Aimee Bratt. It was so interesting to read about the lives of flight attendents, pilots, and management, along with the pictures. She makes the book so interesting, it is hard to put down.Thanks Aimee and the t.v.show Pan Am for bringing this wonderful history back to life.Lorraine WilkieDouglasville,Ga.Dec. 2011"
4,Bygone Era,"Reminds me of my youth spent as a flight attendant's child flying those glorious routes, in Pan Am's first class. A great book of what it was like in more gentle times. A good read if you remember the times of courteous passengers when flying was an adventure. I miss those days."
5,Bratt soars,"I thoroughly enjoyed ""Glamour and Turbulence"". This is not just a book for people who travel often. Any person who is frustrated with the behind-the-scenes politics of any large company will enjoy this easy read from Ms. Bratt. It is informative as well as entertaining. After reading this work you'll have more respect for those who work in the flight industry and must smile through the pain"
1,high-flying tripe,"Simply put, this self-published book from Vantage Press is the literary equivalent of the rubber chicken airlines used to serve in coach class. Bratt's name gives it away -- this is pure egotistical self-indulgence."
4,Fantastic Lobster that's easy to fix,The Lobster Edwardo and Black Eyed Pea Cakes are easy to make and quite a treat. The beer batter for the lobster can also be used with other seafood. You don't have to deep fry as I was able to sauté in a small skillet. Do in multiple batches and you don't use a lot of oil and can just throw it away when done.
5,Best TV for under $2000,"After having a very bad experience with a Sharp 46 LCD 1080p. I am finally satisfied with this Gem of a TV. Bright Sharp picture and great viewing range for an LCD, Sound is only so so but I did not buy a TV for its sound quaility, I have nice surround system for that. 3 HDMI 1080p inputs and ambient lighting, which adjusts and compliments the colors on the screen. This feature works best when the unit mounted on a white wall with the lights off.I Purchased this TV at Best Buy for $1969.This is my second Philips TV. I have a 32"" 720p in the bedroom that performs brilliantly."
1,Bill Of Goods,"We purchased the Philips Ambilight model number 47PFL7432D/37 in August of 2007 from Best Buy, and yesterday, September 10th 2010, it simply stopped working (the set no longer powers on -- it ""clicks"" like it is on, but there's no picture). So, we got 3 years of use out of a $2,000 television. The awesome folks at Philips, after confirming that, yes, our set had suffered from an ""internal malfunction,"" told us our options were to either buy a ""refurbished"" set from them or to call a repairman (they did not offer to pay for said repairman, it should be noted).My hope is that this review stops at least one of you from making the mistake of buying a Philips product."
1,Flawed product,"The can SHOULD feel like it has jelly beans in it -- it should have a rattle to it, orat the very least feel heavy. Instead, it feel completely empty. You're not going tofool a lot of people into opening it."
1,Don't waste your money!,"This CD doesn't really deserve one star, but no stars is not an option. I purchased this CD hoping to hear the sounds of ""crashing waves"". Unfortunately, what I heard was annoying melodies interfering with the sounds of the waves I'd hoped to hear. It wouldn't have been so bad if the melodies had been pleasant ones but selections like ""My Bonnie Lies Over the Ocean"" and ""Blow the Man Down"" just didn't meet my needs. I don't recommend this CD to anyone!!"
3,Common man,"Piers Robinson has clearly demstrated that he is in touch with the views of the common man, so refreshing to read a theoretical book by a leading academic in his field that is clearly in touch with current thinking. I was pleased to see clear and yet not didactic influence from Chomsky. The book casts no aspersions about the influence Ogonovsky, Winter, Drew et al on the thought process that Robinson has employed in order to reach current conclusions.While Eric Berne describes Transactional Analysis as a humanistic educational psychology, Robinson uses the premise that educational difficulties can be addressed effectively with co-operative goodwill and a coherent theoretical framework which clarifies the human dynamics involved. A fantastic read. Well done Robinson. Good chap"
2,Falsification,"This product was suppose to be new, and when I got it on the mail it was a use CD with scrashes in the back. This is a two CD Exitos from Eddie Santiago and both are damage. WHen I received this product in the mail something told me that was a use product because when I open the wrapper it didn't look like and original one, and to top itoff it didn't have the seal from the manufacture.I am very dissapointed because I also order a DVD and it was in the same conditions than the CD. This product was suppose to be new and it was use as well.I would never by anything through Amazon. This is the 3rd this has happened. If it wasn't for my kids that open the product I would it return all the items that order from Amazon.Like I said before very dissapointed, just to others be careful when you by products in Amazon because what you see in the website is not what would you get."
2,charlemagne,one great song (track 4). the rest are ho-hum but completely listenable. i enjoy the all-around sound
3,New Beginnings?,"I don't know if people consider this Keene's best book, but I wouldn't. I like Ned better than Jake, and thought it was sad what happened to Bess. I broke down in tears the exact time she did. I wouldn't be able to come back to college after that. As for Stephanie, I thought she acted pretty much like a loser. Why take it out on your friends? The plot was pretty easy to follow and I ended up solving it without trouble. (Of course, I wasn't there)"
4,karate girl,"Its was good, not great but not bad. Seemed almost the same as One- Chanbara (bikini samurai girls) as far as the sister being split up and fighting against each other. Could have had more realistic confrontations to make the fight action sequences much better. My four stars was because it wasnt in english dub, well the version i got. Don't get me wrong, english dubbed is only perfectly great if they have right voices for the right characters and the voice actors truly know how to speak their acting parts right. So far my all time best new girl/ female martial arts movie is Chocolate. Theres nothing more entertaining then watching so called hard attitude people male or female getting their butts handed to them by a little retarded girl. No disrespect intended."
3,Similar to Birks,"For the most part, these are identical to Birks. The one problem I've had is the soles seem less durable - in just 2-3 mos. I've already worn through the heel edges to the cork, so I'll have to get heel taps to repair them. Usually I think Birks will last a year or so before wearing through to the cork."
5,Most comfortable sandals ever,"I bought a pair of these about 5 years ago for $20 and wish I would have bought 5 more pairs. I quickly found out that they are the most comfortable sandals ever. I have flat feet and most sandals have a flat bottom causing my feet to ache if I walk very far but not these. These sandals have very nice arch support and after a while of wearing them, form to your feet.I searched everywhere for these sandals and all I could find was the original Birkenstocks. I finally found these on Amazon. I'm sure the Birkenstocks are just as nice if not better, but at $80-$100, these are a much better buy."
3,Bait and Switch??,"The sandals are listed as ""Betula Licensed by Birkenstock"" but the sandals as delivered are ""Basic Newalk Licensed by Birkenstock"" and they are made in China. My old Betulas don't say Made in China. We'll see if these last as well as the Betulas."
1,I dont recommend it at all!,I bought this because my ferret Lola likes to be around the house freely playing with my cats all day until is bedtime. I needed something with a bell to now where she is at all times. This collar comes of easily. She takes it out even though I tried thigh it in up almost to the point of choking her lol it did not work. Her head is smaller than her neck so she easily push it out of her neck. I do not recomment this collar or any collar for a ferret.
5,Sir Malcolm Sargent is the BEST!,"The best recording of the Messiah - EVER!!! I've heard (among others) the ""period"" performance w/ the orginal instruments as intended by the composer (Handel) performed by the Dallas Bach Society... But Sir Malcolm's 1946 recording w/ Isobel Baillie, Gladys Ripley, etc. is the BEST in every way. It is the most tasteful, emotional, passionate, yet restrained, and sensitive. It is just beautiful. WELL DONE."
3,Only half of the wire harness,"If you have a 2003 or 2004 ford focus with this stereo, than you will need to buy this. However this is not the whole wire harness. It is only half of it. This part connects to what is in your car. You will need to buy the half that connects to your stereo separately. Then you will need to solder the wires together and use heat shrink tubing or electrical tape to prevent shorting."
1,Quality Issues,"I'll keep to the technical side. The show is as it is, others have written well about it already.Unfortunately, this can't be said about this DVD set. First, the DVD set only has 9 out of 10 Episodes of Season 2. The first Episode (""DOA"") is missing.Worse, the format is horribly broken. The Show is 16:9 - but the data on the DVD is 4:3 with black bars on top and bottom. That looks ok on a 4::3 screen, but horrible on a 16:9 - you get a huge black frame all round the film. And even if you have a player that can enhance this, the black bars are part of the signal - which means you loose resolution - and thus, quality, on the actual content.Overall one of the worst DVD sets for TV shows I've seen. Avoid buying it, demand the Publisher to publish a good one."
4,Love Triangle,"At times the show is a bit slow, but overall I like it, Henry could bite me any day, lol."
5,Christmas present,"This was a Christmas present for my daughter-in-law. The only tiny negative is that the producers chose to artificially split what was a single season on TV into two ""seasons"" for dvd sales. Thus my daughter-in-law got the first half for her birthday in June and the second for Christmas. She loves them, so mission accomplished."
4,my take on blood ties,"I enjoyed the show but found the books much more satisfying. That is pretty common for me with most books turned to tv or movies. The characters and plot seem fairly well done, I understood the story line and could follow the characters actions and motivation. All together I would rate the show an eight on the ten scale."
4,Only 2 Seasons?,"Liked the series, but just 2 seasons, it get you and thats it, I have both seasons, just disappointed it ended. Eve"
5,BLOODTIES SEASON 2,"AWESOME SHOW, UPSET IT DID NOT CONTINUE ON LIFETIME AND THEN CANCELLED. GREAT STORIES BASED ON BOOKS WRITTEN BY CANADIAN WRITER. ENJOY THE SHOWS I DO HAVE. KYLE SCHMIDT PLAYED GREAT VAMPIRE."
4,Canadian Vampire,"I just loved this show, but like most good shows it was cancelled. At least now I can have my copy to watch when I want."
5,needs to continue,"See my review for Season I. This never should have ended. It was done so well and the actors were so good for their parts. This has enough ideas floating around that it should have lasted for many, many seasons."
5,Beautiful But....,"I gave this film 5 stars for its beauty, acting ability, and interesting subject-matter. That being said, the physics involved in the planet, Melancholia, circling back to hit earth [not a spoiler, you know the ending in the 1st 5 minutes of the film] are simply impossible and done to make the movie what it is, a movie.The actors all do great work with very little script.For those of you that like fast action movies like District 9, Transformers, etc... you will never get past the 1st 15 minutes of this film. The film requires the viewer to relax, sit-still, put the stupid phone down, and attempt to find meaning in all the acts."
1,2 Hours and 16 Minutes of Pure Boredom,"This was undoubtedly the most boring moving I have ever watched. The world comes to an end focused upon one dysfunctional family. Frankly, I was glad when the world ended because so did the movie. I can't find anything redeeming from the acting to the storyline, except for maybe some fairly interesting graphics of worlds colliding."
1,Seriously?,"I don't understand why this movie has gotten so much hype and has actually been nominated for awards. I have a feeling akin to going to some ""arts for arts sake"" type show where nothing makes sense other than the clear fact that the ""artists"" are full of self indulgent crap or possibly having a laugh at everyone's expense. Skip it!"
1,Sooooo Depressing and sooooo slow.,"Beginning of film, which is over 7 minutes of VERY slow motion with music-to-commit-suicide-by, that should have warned me off. But the reviews are either one star or five star, so I tried watching more. I really tried. but OH MY GODS, is this ever DEPRESSING.Couldn't watch it long enough to even figure out the sci-fi part. I HAD to stop.If this is supposed to be an artsy movie about the true human condition, humans are doomed."
1,Cheerless Movie,"Sorry, but I'm with the negative reviewers on this completely depressing movie. I only liked the ending where everything was blown to bits including, I hope, all the tapes off this terrible film."
2,"Stunning Visuals, slow-moving plot","The visuals were stunning, especially the beginning. But the plot was very slow-moving, so slow that I nodded off at times throughout the wedding reception scenes. Too much time spent on it when you have a planet on a one-way collision course with Earth, I don't know, thought it was a bit strange.One mention about Claire, for someone who was so scared about the planet Melancholia, she sure spent a lot of time outside. I know it was inevitable and all that but given the circumstances, I would have faced doom inside, eh, but that's just me. And about Justine, she says something to her sister Claire that made me wonder why she bothered to get married in the first place.I'm glad I watched this movie, won't need to see it again."
2,Don't Waste Your Time,"I chose this film based on some of the glowing reviews, but I couldn't make it to the end. Dysfunction is never ""happy"", but this film takes dysfunction to a new, depressing low. At no time during Part 1 did I ever even understand what was going on, except for the fact the bride-to-be's family was sad, depressing, and intent on ruining everyone else's life. The soaring music and visually appealing imagery kept me from a 1-star review, but this is 75 minutes I'll never get back."
1,Unbelievably stupid,This movie makes Gigli look like a 15 time Academy Award winner. If you can make it through the first 10 minutes then you might actually see someone speak. As soon as they do you can only pray that they will shut up. Its just horrible simple as that.
1,Waste of time,"The premise for this movie seemed interesting, a large planet colliding with earth with consequences prior to the collision. In fact this movie was boring and almost to hard to watch to the end. I am glad it was free because I would have demanded my money back."
2,"Well-acted, ponderous, nihilist porn","Well-acted, ponderous, nihilist porn, the dual point of which is that (a) you should live your life amorally, however you want, since existence is inexorably pointless, or (b) you should give up and die, since existence is inexorably pointless. Paradoxically, therefore, so is this movie."
2,Ugly,This movie will bomb at the box office. This movie moved very very slow. I love Kirsten. But this movie is a no go.
1,Overwrought drivel,"This is one of my only film reviews here and I should write the glowing recommendations of the films that truly move me in one way or another. However, this was one of, if not THE, most pointless, least believable, slowest, overly-precious, self-important movies I've ever endured. I actually groaned with amazement over just how bad it was in several areas. I'm disappointed with myself that I sat all the way through thinking somehow, at some point, the movie would redeem itself. Never did, not for one moment. The best compliment I can pay it is that at some points, the cinematography is pretty good. Otherwise, avoid this movie unless you plan a ""bad movie"" party. You can then put this overwrought piece of crap up close to the top of that list."
2,Start was very confusing,"Was a very difficult movie to follow, only part that began to make sense were the last 15 minutes of the movie.Great cast, just odd storyline."
3,"Art, not Action","Very delicate, intentionally confusing, and artistic. Not a normal ""movie"". Two-and-a-half hours of video; roughly 11 minutes of dialogue. Know what to expect. Especially the volume - most of the film is at a 3-4 level. The final minute hits about an Eleven!"
1,One of the Worst,"If you weren't melanchy when you rent this title, don't dispare; you will be by the time it's over. I would truly love to have those 120 minutes of my life back. Tortuous to sit through. At the end I was truly rooting for the run-away planet."
5,moving and stunning movie,"Although this picture is not typically uplifting, I was far from depressed by it. We are brought into very uncomfortable and personally intimate situations, we are not told what to think or expect. I've heard what it meant to other viewers..often not at all what I got out of it, but that's what makes it so interesting. I agree that it's not for the light of heart, it's an emotionally heavy but absolutely gorgeous film."
1,melancholia,"this movie has the stupiest start for a movie i have ever seen,maybe if i ever finish seeing it, i will feel different,sorry. now i have seen the rest of the movie and i thought it was a terrible movie, i did not like it, do not was your money . it is free on netflix.perhaps i am not as sophisticated as some of the other movie watchers"
1,can you special P-R-E-T-E-N-T-I-O-U-S??,"In my opinion, the opener in slow motion wrapped up the film fairly well evenbefore we see the titles etc. We are thenintroduced to the happy bride and groom, in a stretch a block long, as they attempt to drive around hairpin curves to Justine's sister and brother-in-law's home for their receptionI almost checked out there.Later I wish I had.I particularly loved the scene near the end when Justine tells Claire she knew all along how many jelly beans were in the jar. . .???????? like it is truly significant.The only fairly sane person in the equation seemed to the groom who left early when it was obvious that their marriage was over.Finally, I found it unconscionable when we see Justine beating her horse..I realize she was frustrated but. . . .Just three words of advice:Skip this turkey"
1,"Warning, stock up on dramamine","This movie sets a new low in the overuse of ""shaky cam"". My wife went to the bathroom and vomitted 10 minutes in. Seriously, I am not kidding, she actually threw up trying to watch this movie. Unless you REALLY like over two hours of bob-and-weave camera work STAY AWAY FROM THIS FILM!!!!The opening images were stunning, we had high hopes, and then.... OMG. Is there any way I can fast forward to an era when this pretentious, over worked, substitute for actually having a good story to tell has been abandoned? Does anyone ever walk away from a film and say, ""It was good, but I wish the camera man had taken the camera off the tripod and danced around like he had to pee real bad while he was shooting it. That would have really improved the film!"""
1,trash,"I'll preface my negative review of the movie with this:- Great acting by Dunst. She perfectly plays an abhorrent character.- Some really cool visuals and cinematographyHalf the movie involves a wedding and how Dunst is too emo and artsy to deal with her family or her spineless new husband. The second half involves panicky characters trying to cope with the potential of the world coming to an end. The movie is disturbingly slow and the characters are such terrible, terrible people. This movie was made by someone with no understanding of physics (if a planet comes anywhere near our planet, especially if that planet is larger, the rise in tides would cause tsunamis that would wipe us all out way before such a planet could hit us); it is a truly artistic endeavor.I'm actually offended that I was made to believe this would be an ""incredible"" and ""beautiful"" film. I struggled through everything beyond the first 5 minutes."
2,"You might not be dissapointed, but then again...","Honestly, there were a lot of things right about this movie. Sadly, there were too many things that were wrong. Kirsten's character was a horribly self-centered, heartless, selfish girl. The only person she cared about was her, even in the end. However, the acting was done very well especially by Charlotte Gainsbourg. Honestly the ridiculous wedding antics shouldn't have happened. It made no sense to me why they would show a girl who could presumably see the future, be so cruel to a man who really loved her. And then show her torturing her poor sister afterwards (the same family that cared for her and paid for her lavish wedding). I can't decide if it's worth watching or I wasted my time."
3,Strangely Entertaining,"I see that the one-star reviews almost match the 5-star reviews by the numbers. This isn't too surprising in that this movie was definitely a mixed bag. I gave it 3 stars - I sort of enjoyed it, sort of was drawn into it and definitely wouldn't watch it again, as you might with some movies. Anyway, as I said in the review title, ""strangely entertaining""."
3,Thank God!,"Beautifully shot and presented, the story was just aggravating and didn't sit well with me. Justene was obviously very ill and needed the care of a good doctor, yet the family grudgingly tolerated her without doing anything to help her. I guess the best part about this movie (Spoiler Alert!) is that there definitely won't be a Melancholia II... LOL!"
1,Close Planet Collision,"Art film or not, anyone who knows anything about gravitational forces between planets knows that a blue gas giant is not going to be able to get away from its sun, let alone wander into another solar system without severely disrupting the orbits of other planets along the way....hey, maybe this is the metaphor? D'ya think? This movie is heavy handed, screams ""Hey, look at my cool symbolism!"" to a nauseating degree, and frankly, I wss confused when they kept pronouncing Justine (Jus-teen) as Justin (Juh-stin). Through most of the first part, I thought Justine was a transsexual. It would have made the movie way more interesting if that had turned out to be true. This turkey is turgid, slower than snot in January, unrealistic, and does nothing to explore clinical depression other than in a superficial kind of way. Try some Samuel Coleridge for the real deal. Or read Darkness Visible by William Styron."
2,there's nothing Melancholy about this movie,"Melancholy and depressed are not the same thing. Melancholy is like depression, in that its a kind of sadness, except it's a sadness that doesn't hurt. It's a sadness that hugs you like a blanket.This film is about a character whose depression is physically crippling her, which I didn't realize could/does happen, but the learning of that is the only thing this film offers. It does not relate to the viewer the feelings that the lead character feels, it just shows how everything & everyone around her is let down by her condition.I wanted melancholy. I didn't get it. If you're a survivor of this disease or know someone who has/had it, then maybe this film will be either a stunning memory revisited or a way to bond with your loved one(s).The acting was good, cinematography was appropriately gloomy. Chock it up to poor marketing, but either way, someone involved in this movie made a mistake (or two...)."
4,Different but enjoyable,"There are a lot of mixed reviews on this movie. I really enjoyed it. I went into it open-minded, not expecting your usual commercialized movie. It felt like the characters could be real people, with real life problems. It was a little slow in parts but it's not an action movie, it's a sci-fi drama."
4,worth owning,"Chose to purchase rather than rent, due to most reviews. Not disappointed, to say the least...Kirsten Dunst proves to be one of the more talented young actresses in film. While I typically am not a Keifer Sutherland fan, his performance is very impressive/memorable. The movie seems a little sluggish out of the gate, but at some point it occurs to you that you're completely engulfed in this dark, fairly heavy story. Worth owning and will watch many more times, I'm sure."
4,"Loved it, would watch it again",Very artsy and interesting human interaction. The plot sneaks up on you and then you realize there is more going on so you have to watch it again with a different perspective.
1,Melancacalia.,"I watched the first ten minutes or so until Part 1 appeared on the screen. I paused and rewound back to the beginning. Then I hit PLAY to get it going again and I next hit FAST FORWARD to speed up that ultra-super-slow-motion opening sequence so I was able to see the opening sequence again but in just about real-time speed. You should try it. (***SPOILER ALERT***) Yowzah! There goes the little blue planet into the big blue planet KAH-BLOO-EEEE! COOL! Then when it got back to the Part 1 title card once more, I slowed back to normal PLAY speed, the film continued playing (and playing and playing and...) and it was all pretty much downhill after that. I want those two hours of my life back, I want them back right this minute and I swear I'm gonna sit right here and I'm gonna hold my breath until... I.... get..... them...... ba........."
1,Horribly depressing and very slow at getting to the literal end,"I didn't care for this movie at all. This isn't even a sad but cathartic movie... It was just horribly depressing. Like Titanic, you know what's going to happen, but it happens soooooo slowly! It's not worth the ride, especially if the ride makes you feel like there's no hope and you might as well end it all.Would not recommend this to anyone.Now I need to go watch something happy and joyful just to wash this sludge off of me...."
1,Depressed beware!!!,"I do not mind post apocalyptic tales, but there are few words for this. While it might be a cinematic wonder, it leaves no hope for humanity. A film should take you away from reality, yet inspire hope. I was anticipating an ending, but not the despair of Justine and the cloaked despair of her sister.If you have ever been treated for or think you had the slightest bit of depression, DO NOT SEE THIS FILM. Even those with perfect mental health will have to fight to maintain a sense that there is some hope for the survival of humankind."
1,Don't bother!,"The trailer made this movie look appealing.... big name stars and a fantastical sci-fi plot. The first 10 or 15 min are the only part of this movie worth watching. Why did I watch it to the end? I kept hoping for a huge effects ending and instead got zip! A total waste of time, I would have been much happier watching a documentary or political debate.... 'nuff said!"
3,More Melancholia-- Less Dysfunction,"The evocative, dreamy, slow-motion previews for this movie are largely from the fascinating, eerie opening 10 or 15 minutes of the film-- with the Wagner soundtrack and the images of the Earth frankly being destroyed. I was hooked by the preview and I was riveted by these picturesque vignettes. The bulk of the film, however, consists of the plodding, repetitive, stilted Part 1: Justine (focusing on one sister's escalating depression during the night of her horrific bourgeois wedding reception) and the more interesting Part 2: Claire (which centers on the other sister's escalating panic at the thought of the earth being destroyed). For me, Part 1 was too long, and Part 2 should have been developed-- it could have been the entire movie. I wanted to love it. I only liked it. The film just doesn't deliver on the promise of the opening montage."
1,"Pretentious, boring, awful, caca!","Do not waste your time on this boring, self-indulgent crap! The script is rediculous, the characters are unrealistic outside of an asylem (though we're meant to accept them as ""real"") and everyone feels so sorry for themselves you'll want to kill yourself after the first half hour, a which point you'll probably turn it off like I did just to save your own life."
1,Tried too hard to be art...,"...from the very beginning. The best line of the movie is when Duntz's character turns to her husband and says ""what did you expect?""--which is exactly how you should feel if you waste time watching this."
1,Visually beautiful movie but that's about it....,"Not really sure what happened in this movie...very bizarre and I usually like bizarre! Beautiful visuals, though. I don't recommend it unless you just want to look at pretty pictures!"
1,Terrible,Had to stop watching halfway through. Just terrible. Frustratingly slow and the storyline just flat pissed me off. Who has an affair on the night of their wedding? No one we need to see a movie about. Just terrible.
1,unsteady view,"This film was very hard to watch because the film maker chose to use handheld cameras which always bobbed up and down, right and left. Both my wife and I got so motion sick that we started fast forwarding through the movie because we were close to throwing up. It's hard to imagine that this movie had a budget in the millions of dollars but they couldn't spend a small part of that money on tripods to stabilize the cameras. This movie may have had some artistic merit but it was lost on my wife and me."
1,"This movie not only about depression, it causes it","Wow, where do you start? This film is a train wreck from the begining to the end. I have read the many reviews and though I would give it a try, but boy was I diaapointed. Don't waste any time on this one, even if you're locked in a middle seat on a plane in economy class at 40,000 feet. You'll have a better time watching the person on either side of you drool as they sleep. Pass on this one!!!"
1,depressive,"This movie is awful. I hate it. Love the actors are great, but horrible story line. Two thumbs down. Its about the world ending after an awfully sad wedding. Definitely don't watch if your planing a wedding."
1,OMG! Blah!!!,"Well crafted, all around. That said, it's probably one of the most pretentious films ever made. In the end, I found it very distasteful -- the perfect atheistic counterpart to Terrence Malick's TREE OF LIFE (which I loved). My favorite thing about MELANCHOLIA: Kirsten Dunst's nude planet-bathing. I found a lot about this film to be straight up dorky, and I'd like to add a note to any aspiring filmmakers: slapping Wagner's beautiful music into your film doesn't (by default) create high art. FAIL."
1,no use,"Zero stars; negative-five stars. I like art movies with a strong signature - other things don't interest me much. But this one, like all too many of them, is nothing but a frontal attack on vitality and beauty."
3,Just Ok.,"This was an odd sort of movie. Divided into two part, it seemed very disjointed. It had the feeling of being shot with a hand held camcorder. Alexander Skarsgard is in the 1st part but not the 2nd part. Poorly timed. Some parts dragged on and on and other parts of the movie ran well. Intense musical score makes this feel like a silent movie. If you are a fan of any of the 3 major players you may enjoy the movie. For me, even the presence of Alexander Skarsgard did not save this movie. Just ok says it all."
4,Weird but worth the watch.,"This is not something you want to watch with your teenage kids. They will be bored.But a good watch on a rainy day. A bit of sci-fi, a bit psycho, lots of fantasy."
5,Masterpiece,"Melancholia is a metaphysical film in the sense that it asks about the limits of existence. The film is an absolute masterpiece. It is clearly the best movie made in 2011 but, predictably, it has not received much press. Anyone should watch this movie!"
3,How much pain can you stand and how long can you stand it?,"The depressed and neurotic rich meet a planet with an ego even bigger than theirs. Spoiler, the plant wins thankfully. For those of you into rather oversized breasts, there's a long shot of Kirsten's. I suppose the idea that she 'knows things' meant she knew the end of the Earth was coming soon. That would make it either more difficult or perhaps easier to enjoy your wedding reception. She decided to make it difficult. Hubby for an evening was kind of a dork anyway. This is the kind of movie that will show up on Mystery Science Theater 3000 sooner or later. The way to enjoy it is to add your own dialogue and observations as the movie plods along; add a pitcher of vodka martinis, well chilled."
1,Well...theres two hours of my life I will never get back...,"I don't know....maybe I just don't get it. The entire 1st half of the movie titled Justine... seriously? WTF I had to force myself to watch this to the end just on the hope that it might go somewhere. Nope never went anywhere. What the hell does the fist half have to do with the second half?? Do not watch this movie, you will be wasting your time."
1,Hard to follow,"It just seems more happened off camera for the story than was revealed in the actual screen part of the story. It's like walking into a movie half way through it and trying to figure out who is who and what is what. And, what you can figure out isn't very interesting anyways. And what is with the mumbling of the lines? Very hard to hear."
2,Unrealistic Portrayal of the Characters,"In a science fiction movie, I can forgive unrealistic portrayal of the science, but not the fiction. A writer or director can make his characters do or say anything. I couldn't enjoy this movie, not because it was depressing or because the science was implausible but because people just don't act the way these characters acted or if they do cannot possibly be as successful as these characters are."
2,Slow and Depressing,"I had high hopes for this film from its reviews. After about twenty minutes in I started asking my friends if we could leave. This movie was painfully slow and tedious. True, the visuals were outstanding, but that can't make up for everything else. Yes the cast was wonderful as well, but the story itself was mediocre at best. All the characters were incredibly difficult to relate to and they all seemed to have mental issues which made them even more difficult to like. I feel like they could have just kept the first and last ten minutes of the movie (these were the best parts/visuals) and ditched the rest of the film. I have no problem with ""indie"" type films, but this one just didn't impress me. I didn't go in looking for an action movie but I went in looking for a movie with a clear direction. For me, this film was just too all over the place."
3,"Oddly enough, I both liked it and disliked it.","This was a very odd film to watch. Some of it was extremely visually striking, but the first section was sooooo slow moving, that I stopped watching it, only to start watching it again several days later, only to stop again and then start it up again several times. It literally took me about two weeks to finally watch it in its entirety. It was the kind of movie where you really want to stop watching it, but there is just enough there to make you keep going. What kept me going was the ""newly discovered planet"" angle (which is why I started watching it in the first place). Once it was over, I guess I vaguely liked it, but that's about all I can say. It was, however, an interesting portrayal of depression."
4,"Unusual ,, provocative!",Apocalyptic but strangely mesmerizing and surreal despite the chaos and madness that approaches! Kristen Dunst was great as was the rest of the cast !
3,"Truly art, but it was so long","Captures depression and tragedy well. Otherwise, nothing about this film really caught my attention. I laughed a few times during the first half, but sometimes I laugh at things that are not meant to be funny. I wouldn't recommend this movie to a lot of people because they would most likely find no meaning in it, and think it quite boring. I only recommend for adults who enjoy a thought-provoking work."
4,I would watch it again,"Depression is at the heart of this movie. I do not suffer from depression, but my friends who watched it with me do. Put it this way...Melancholia's portrayal of a depressed person and the way her condition affects her fiance/husband & others around her connected with me. But my depressed friends hated the film. Too close to home for them, I suppose. But I'm ready for another viewing."
1,Beware!!!!,"Wow what can one say about this flick. Lots of great actors and actresses. Keifer Sutherland played an excellent part. He couldn't even take the movie and had to kill himself. Poor editing, crappy story line and probably the worst movie of its time. The only reason I gave it one star was for how hard we laughed making jokes during the film."
1,Don't waste your time,"This is not an exciting end of the world flick. Melancholia is just depressing and odd. Two sisters deal with the end of the world in their own weird ways. The first half of the movie just makes you not like the sister that is featured. She seems very selfish and I don't think she even knows the world is ending at that point! The second half is more like I expected with a young mother trying to deal with the first weird sister, her husband and her son who thinks the whole end of the world is a science lesson from school. There are probably supposed to be ""lessons"" from the behavior of the horses, etc. but Melancholia is not well enough directed for any sense of things to come through."
1,Horrible.,I was really surprised at how depressing this movie really was. Melancholia. Why didn't I put the title and the contents of the movie together? I could not get into it. I really tried. I woke up and watched as they all got destroyed as a family. Who wants to watch stuff like that? Perhaps there was something deeper to be conveyed here. I consider myself to be an eclectic viewer when it comes to movies but this was one was a stretch for me.
1,Duck!!!!,"A fashion shoot masquerading as philosophy . . . buy Vogue instead, cheaper & more to think about. If you must, watch the first 10 minutes."
2,"great acting, cinematography, concept.....but a weak script",The concept of this movie was a good one. The cinematography was absolutely fantastic. the acting was actually quite superb. the script is what just actually was terrible. so in other words this movie is basically a polished turd. its really sad because it really had serious potential and could have been absolutely great.
2,"Disfunction Junction, What's Your Malfunction?","I'm predisposed to like a Lars von Trier movie. He is one of the most challenging directors working today and I like a challenging movie. But, while I can appreciate what von Trier attempted with ""Melancholia"", for me, it didn't succeed. I can empathize with the extreme, debilitating depression portrayed. I recognize the metaphor of Melancholia destroying the world. I can recognize the good performances portraying severely damaged (but still not very interesting) people. The special effects are breathtaking without being oversold. There are a number of stunningly beautiful shots. A story, however, needs to be about something important and this attempt to reveal something important by focusing on the excruciatingly trivial, sadly, fails. It left me wanting to watch another movie about people I could care about facing the situation."
1,Are You Kidding?,"Could this be any more boring, self-indulgent, or just plain time-wasting? This is not a movie; it's not a story; it's not much of anything really. There are no actual characters, just pretty people posturing and posing and pouting for the camera. Don't bother. It gets no stars from me but that wasn't an option so I gave it the one. Btw, I detest Transformers and its ilk."
1,Awful mess of a movie.,"I only made it partially through this movie. A stellar cast could not make this movie work. There is a huge difference between being depressed & being a jerk. You can be depressed without being a jerk. Kirsten Dunst's character is a jerk, who happens to be depressed. I just wasn't buying the whole ""I'm depressed, my life is terrible, I make bad choices"" thing. The plot was painfully slow. Whatever the movie was trying to achieve, I freely admit that I didn't get it. Hated this movie."
1,"I need Prozac, STAT!","This movie is so depressing, so plodding and so boring, I am still amazed I stayed through the whole thing. I love Kirsten Dunst and Alexander Skaarsgard, but they were virtually unlikeable in this movie."
1,one of the worst movies I've ever seen,This movie had so much positive buzz when it came out and it was full of actors I really enjoyed in other projects. I kept waiting for it to get better or more interesting. The characters are really ridiculous and despite the army of fine actors on this project it looked to me like a poor version of a high school theater production of a play. So much potential and such a waste of talent and time. I want my two hours back!
2,"Visually interesting, but ultimately disappointing","I enjoy unconventional films that take risks & give this film some credit for that. There are some creative & beautiful scenes that are done with subtlety, rather than blockbuster effects. But I found this film slow & meandering. Unlike Bergman, who illuminated his often depressing subjects with real insights & depth, I thought the subject of melancholia or depression was only presented in superficial bits & pieces. Not a terrible film & I can understand why some people enjoyed it, but I think the premise had great potential that was not realized."
1,Trying very hard to imitate art,"This looks like it could have had potential. A movie is supposed to mean something in more than one way unless it is just fun and entertaining, which this is not. This movie is the creation of an obviously self-important narcissist who expected the world to admire his beauty as he. Don't waste your time unless you want to take a stab at a stab at cinema. Or unless you are a psych student looking for term paper material."
1,The worst waste of time on celluloid.,"I must admit I don't spend much time on any negative reviews, but this movie was so bad. It plays out 3 people at the end of the world as It's crashing into another planet?? The Dialkogue is even way off. Makes no sense. This was the worst movie of the year so far. Stay away from It. Unless you get a chance free. But even then It not watchable."
1,Truly Depressing,"Art is not depressing, nor is beauty hopeless. This is not art, nor wisdom, but wasted actors on a juvenile script with an incoherent director. Truly awful. It is so bad is is nearly comical. And, may I say, hopeless and depressing. Avoid if at all possible."
3,"Three stars, only because the second half was marginally better","This movie was recommended on a site I frequent as a good example of a post apocalyptic movie. Uh, not really.These are my thoughts, after having sat through t w o a n d a h a l f h o u r s of cinematic awkwardness:Was that...? Did she...? Who was...? See the pretty pictures..... Why did...? Did you see...? Howcome they...? But that didn't...? What? I mean, if she....ok, maybe not, but if he....but...? What? Just...what??If the entire movie was more like the second half of the movie, it may have had a bit more interest, but as it is it...no. Just...no."
1,The shaky cam trend needs to end,"Made myself sit through nearly 10 minutes of very strange intro, only to be rewarded with shaky cam extravaganza. It's nauseating and difficult to watch!"
5,Not Like Any Other Film I've Seen,"I won't give too much away with this review. I will say that the key to enjoying the film is understanding that it is dramatic, beautiful and very, very sad. Be prepared to feel everything the characters are feeling. The pacing is slow, so even though it's PG-13, most teens will probably hate it. The plot is also vague, yet the film never strays away from it. In fact, you won't see the characters interact with anyone other than the main characters, with the exception for the butlers and ""the Bettys"".It's really not like any other film I've seen and I truly enjoyed it. Donnie Darko is the closest comparison I can think of. It was stuck in my head the next day which is how I know it was really, really good."
2,Had a great nap in between,"The beginning kinda saddened me. Maybe that was the point. I was beginning to think this was a musical? The actual movie starts at 8:30.I actually liked Dunst's character because I never knew what she was going to do next.Kept staring at her cleavage, wishing it were mine. Just who are these people?"
1,Didn't like it,"I couldn't get into it at all. I watched it for about 10mins and was really bored. The camera was a little shaky the whole time I watched it and there wasn't anything reeling me in to watch more. Again I didn't watch the whole film, because I didn't get into it so I don't know if it gets any better. This is just my opinion. It's not my taste. I like action or a great story line and just didn't see it."
5,Item arrived fine. Move is one of the best I ever seen in years.,"Item good condition. The move is exceptional, pure beauty and poetry, I could not express in words the feeling it conveys to one's soul. Pure magic to see such a movie. Thank you."
2,Shaky Cam!,This may be a good movie but I just can't watch constant shaky cam. If you're not a fan of bad shaky cam then beware!
1,Snoozefest,"Not for me, I stopped watching an hour in to be honest. The first 7 minutes of the movie are some slow motion scenes with music playing that dragged for far too long. I can't really give a full review since I didn't finish the movie but I can give it 1 star for boring me into submission."
2,Could barely wait for the movie to end,"I'm sorry, I know this movie was much acclaimed and I really wanted to like it - was looking forward to seeing it. But, alas, the only thing I did enjoy was the first surrealist 10 or so minutes, which were visually stunning. After that, I was just waiting for all the annoying characters to be eliminated (although the Justine character (Kristin Dunst) is somewhat redeemed of her irritating melancholy at the end of the movie). There are 3 basically 3 parts to the movie - The Wedding, The sister of the Bride and The End. As, I have said, the 3rd part was eagerly anticipated after sitting for over 2 hours watching this dysfunctional family await the inevitable. I realize this was an art movie, but I think the movie could have moved along more quickly without loosing any of its substance."
1,Pathetic,I started watching this movie because I like the actors in it. This is one of the slowest movies I have ever tried to watch. Dark and dreary. At least they got the name right.
1,Do not waste your money!!!,"Mark Erimite took the words out of my mouth.It is a pretentious movie. Beautiful photography , the effects with the phantom camera are beautiful but do not justify investing time watching Melancholia. Another dysfunctional family.I am sorry for the time invested in watching it."
2,Terribly depressing,Potentially the most depressing movie I have ever seen. A real downer. Only watch this if you need to feel bad about everything in life.
1,Melanflopia,HORRIBLE. I wouldnt even give this movie 1 star. I cant get those 2 hours back Why? Please someone tell me why? The planet is worse off now.
2,ugh,this is just not my style at all...I had no connection to the characters and found them all unlikeable so the thought of them all exploding was not a bad idea at all....
1,ZERO STARS OK?,"This movie was too obtuse for me to grasp or it was just totally stupid. I thought the cast was great and the setting was fantastic, but the plot was totally ""dysfunction junction"" in my opinion. Pass and a waste of time and money."
1,melancholia,All in all this movie sucked. It went from bad to worse. If you like classical music then at least you have something to listen to once in awhile.
1,ZERO STARS FOR SURE!,"I'm not sure if this movie could get anymore boring but if you like to watch grass grow or paint dry then you'll enjoy this movie. They talk sooooo quietly that I had my TV turned all the way up and even then I could barely hear them speaking. I'm sure they were trying to pull off something ""Artsy"" but good grief this was bad! Way too many unneeded scenes and clips that were just thrown in with long drawn out music."
1,Soooooooo Sloooooooooow!,"With all the named actors in this movie, I really was expected it to be good. The slowmo opening sequence is cool but it gets boring and drags. Then the movie starts and I kept waiting for something to happen....but nothing. So boring. Lighting is rough. Camera work does not match the moods. I don't know what they were thinking. I couldn't watch it passed 20 minutes. Imagine watching all the ""deleted scenes"" on a DVD. Nothing made sense to me. Maybe it goes somewhere later but I just couldn't watch the rest. What a waste of rental! I've seen C and D movies that are better than this."
4,"Haunting, elegant, unpredictable","You will need some patience just to get through the first eight or so minutes of this film, featuring a dreamlike sequence of disturbing yet unforgettable and beautiful images that make more sense as it goes on. The next two hours takes you into the lives of a bride who dumps her groom and stays with her sister's family while a planet called Melancholia makes its way towards Earth, possibly on a collision course with it.The photography is stunning, the acting is top-notch, and if you are willing to give it a chance, Melancholia may grow on you.It ends....exactly the way it should."
1,About as engaging as spending time in a funeral parlor,"Someone forgot to tell Lars van Trier that ""boring"" is the first deadly sin. When the movie opens with slow-mo of planets colliding and Kirsten Dunst running through fields to swelling strains of classical music, you kind of get the sense you're in for a slow slog. But not THIS slow. I could honestly only handle about 30 minutes of this before I bailed, though I had also seen snatches from later in the film. The whole thing is dull, amateurish, boring, and seems almost entirely improvised. About what you might come up with if you took your Flip video to a dinner party or family gathering. Only worse. And it's done with handheld camera. Someone forgot to tell van Trier that it helps to have a script and art direction and some kind of dramatic conception before you attempt a film. This thing is dramatically inert. Sullen. Unengaging. Lacking any real sense of a directorial hand."
4,"Beguiling, pastoral work of art","It's a film that is actually quite difficult to describe in a few words, but I will try. It reminds me of a symphony (no doubt,Wagner's music helped a bit!) wrapped in a psychological family drama with no resolution, with an ending fitting to the state of a depressed person who has no hope of recovery from her situation.So, I will end this review in much the same way Von Trier ended his film: ________________________________________________________."
5,Rare gem,"The cinematography and music is just spectacular. The acting and actors was awesome. It stayed in my head days after I watched it and after watching it again, it's definitely going to be a part of my movie library for keeps. People debate that it's art or sci-fi film. Well, debate if you must, but I thought it was very entertaining. Yes, a little depressing, but it carried me away!"
1,Melancholia,"Among the worst movies I have ever seen in my life. There is nothing redeeming and when it is over you won't be awestruck by the ""artfulness"" of it, you will be furious that you wasted two perfectly good hours of your life. Don't see it."
1,Do not watch this on Amazon Instant Video,"I'd give the film, a 2 or 3, but Amazon Instant Video makes it completely unwatchable. It momentarily pauses literally every 15 seconds once the second part of the movie starts, at the same parts every time, regardless of whether my connection was good or not."
2,LIKE A JUDD APATOW MOVIE WITH NO JOKES,"When Bores Collide more like it. This coma inducing, navel gazing cinematic torture session has only a strong cast to save it from being a total travesty.Kirsten Dunst is fantastic as the deranged bride at the end of the world. Charlotte Gainsbourg also registers strongly as her sister. John Hurt turns up looking like an alcoholic Baron Munchausen, Charlotte Rampling is the harridan from Hell mother of the bride (makes you pine for Ilsa, She Wolf of the SS) and von Trier perennial Udo Kier provides a comic relief of sorts.Von Trier seems to be getting worse as a filmmaker and his usual nihilistic attitudes abound. Women are usually whores, loonies or nutbusters (or a combination there of) and the men are aggressive abusers or doormats.Apparently making movies helps von Trier deal with his depression, this seems like a very elaborate and expensive way of doing it.And it's the audience who really suffers here.Ugh! Pass the Zoloft."
2,Boring,Okay I rented this film and I am glad I did. .Everyone has diffrent tastes I found this movie to be just downright depressing.
1,Worst movie ever!,Worst movie ever. The first 20 minutes is in slow motion. I couldn't watch more than 30 minutes of the entire movie. Boring and made no sense.
2,This was SAD with its worldview being false.,"Kirsten Dunst's character was crazed and melancholy because she knew the world was coming to an end innately in her being. THe movie gives the message that this life on planet earth is all there is, and this simply is not the truth.. The movie is SAD because it gives the message that life on this fallen planet is all there is. This is one of the biggest lies humans believe. THe truth is that there is God creator and God is spirit who is personal and created us in his image, male and female. When we die and leave our physical bodies, our souls and spirits don't just rest. Our lives are not meaningless. If they were, there would be no morale. We exist because of something greater than ourselves. We don't exist to exist. That is impossible. THis movie's message was incorrect with a great error in its worldview."
1,Boring and awful.,"What was the point of this movie? I didn't care about the characters, and watching Kirsten Dunst mope around for two hours and fifteen minutes was just torture. Awful, awful movie."
1,"DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY - Long, boring and no redeeming qualities","This movie was EXTREMELY slow and boring. The characters were annoying and poorly developed. AND IT WAS NOT SCI-FI. Just because a planet crashes into Earth at the end, does not make it a sci-fi movie. I tried really hard to like this movie and was extremely confused by the good reviews it received. This movie literally made time move slow and was painful to watch. I do enjoy many more ""artistic"" movies, but I found nothing to like about this. DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY. I want my $10 and 2 hours back."
1,NOT SCI-FI,"Never in my life have I seen a film this vile! It is not sci-fi; the end of the world by planetary colision is only a device to give some finality to a mentaly ill cast. What little humanity any of the charicters had in the begining of the film they through away at first chance. This is a 'Nausea' of a film missing the final chapter. At least Sartre, after stripping any of his readers of any joy, enexplicitialy, said, ""and he was 'somehow' happy, this film is a sick snuff film of the soul.This is beyond 'don't waist your time'; this is an invitation to athiests to believe in a hell for people who make a movie this vile."
1,Huge waste of time,"Don't waste your time watching this movie. Anyone who liked this movie should get their head examined. I suffer from depression and this movie has nothing to do with depression, it has to do with someone trying to write a artsy fartsy movie and fell seriously short."
1,AWFUL!!!,"I gave this 1 star only because I couldn't give it 0. This is the absolute worst, most boring movie I have ever watched - couldn't even finish watching it, it was so bad. Don't waste your money on this movie."
1,Couldn't even finish it,"I thought this would be a great movie, the cast (powerful), the director. Sure I know Von Triers can be strange. To date, Antichrist is the most disturbing yet powerful movie I think I've ever seen.But despite what should have been major assets, I could NOT engage with this movie. The characters were all passive dull shadows. I turned it off halfway because I couldn't muster any energy, empathy, interest in ANYTHING abut these people. Some beautiful cinematography, but that wasn't enough.Could be good cure for insomnia though."
4,NWO Be Damned!,"The star power on this little film should be a clue that something extraordinary might be happening here;and something remarkable is.No...not just the denouement....a planet really is hitting earth.It's the conspiracy of creatives to say something very real and honest that the media is suppressing.Make no mistake: this is a literal metaphor.The ""dysfunctional family"" are archetypes, wherein Keifer Southerland'scharacter stands in for the """"Elite"" and the rest of us are waiting painfully for the Brideof Christ to be revealed. There is no rapture in these two hours...but there is truth aplenty.Listening...."
2,OMG,"Wow...Lars needs some serious prozac or ecstasy. What a miserable git. Is it visually striking? Yes. But if his themes are that morose, why doesn't he just off himself already and improve the planet."
3,Interesting but disturbing,"Melancholia is visually stunning. The cinematogaphy is captivating and beautiful. The acting is also well done. But the storyline is disturbing. The movie actually consists of two parts, or acts similar to a play, focusing on each of the two main female characters. Both characters have individual psychological issues they must face and by the end of the movie they become intertwined in helping each other through their problems. This movie jabs at your psyche in the same manner as Black Swan, compelling you to watch and wanting to turn it off at the same time. Be prepared for this movie to stay with you long after the end credits."
4,Slow but fascinating,"The movie was slow and a little hard to watch. But lots of beautiful things feel that way to me. Its fascinating, has real character, beautiful cinematography, and lots of metaphor. Not all of the plot added up for me, but it worked.However, its not for everyone. I'd call it a refreshing Sci-Fi with real humanity mixed in, or a drama with a thought provoking twist. Either way, I enjoyed it and it felt like watching art."
5,This is what soft Sci-Fi is all about,"Don't mind the people that hated this movie. They are probably the ones who like Transformers with explosions every 2 seconds, and can't sit through anything with intelligence if their life depended on it. Sorry for the slight troll, but this movie was great! If you are at all a fan of soft sci-fi (philip k. dick, ursula k. le guin) you will most likely love this movie."
5,Nothing in between,You either love this film or you hate it. And those who hate if probably loved TREE OF LIFE and vice versa. Personally I love it and think it's one of the most beautiful films I've ever seen. It also stands up to multiple viewings. Some of the scenes from this movie are burned in my brain; I don't think I'll ever forget them. Extremely intriguing vision of the director.
5,Great,"Could be a history channel documentary project. More than required reading for women's studies courses, this text should be required for history and business courses as well."
5,First time all the tracks are excellent!,"This is the first time I've had a cd, where all the tracks are great. I strongly recommend this cd to most anyone. It has a fun, frisky sound and the beats are truly catchy. Get it. It's great!!!!!!!"
1,Don't bother!,"This is a picture book with a lot of pics that can be seen on Carrot Top's official web site. Poorly bound - falling apart after the second look-through. Even a diehard fan will be dissapointed unless you really like pictures. If you like a book with actual text to read, buy ""Junk in the Truck""."
4,Fine,"My 18 month old likes it, only goes up to 5, so not much counting involved, but I guess enough for an 18 month old!"
5,Great for the little ones,"Our little one loves ""Blue"", and best of all vocabulary skillshave increased."
1,Stopped working after two weeks of purchasing it.,"It showed an extreme limited number of game codes on the CD that I couldn't extend for other games,It is self deleting the codes for games already downloaded on here and barely worked in my Playstation 2.No I would not recommend this at all to anyone,Don't Buy it!!!!"
3,too many violent games,"Game Shark was purchased for GranTurismo4 codes which are great but the remaining content is just too violent. There are way too many violent games for Play Station and not enough truly challenging and entertaining ones. Killing, real or fake, is not entertainment."
2,"GameShark PS2 Greatest Hits: 465 Codes for 10 PS2 Games (2005, Volume 1)","This cheat disc contains what it claims to contain. It has cheat codes for 10 games. It had less codes available for the two games I own, when compared to other cheat discs, I own. It did not really give me any cheats that I did not already have."
3,Good,I feel neutral on this gameshark despite that it won't let players delete and add new codes to it. It's limited. Good luck.
3,it is it cool to device makes games more fun.,I'm really glad I got this I have a ps2 in a couple games I can never beat the gameshark makes it much easier I recommend it to anyone that likes to play without worry about dying or or need more money or anything.
3,shark hits,this is just to provide additonal moves for my games and i think it is very helpful. there is not much more i can say.
4,good,"I messed up and did not realize this was just the greatest hits, but I was able to borrow my buddies gameshark and when I save off of his gameshark I got all those codes to."
4,a very enjoyable hour,"I very much enjoyed Kevin's new hour. Lots of great bits strung together from his long career make this new special a very entertaining and enjoyable event. Great personality, hilarious delivery. Very likable comedian with more experience and charisma than he knows what to do with."
5,Is Kevin Nealon Stalking ME?,"Kevin Nealon proves again that observations from every day life make the best humor. There I was chuckling along with the audience when deja vu suddenly hit me: I may not be the gal that answers her own questions but I'm the one that has a running conversation with her schnauzers on their walk. I don't smoke pot either but there I was chowing down on a pan of brownies while watching this. When he talked about MY upcoming colonoscopy (a week from Monday) I began to wonder - was Kevin Nealon been stalking me? What am I going to do? Now hear me out, I'm not the paranoid type, but that's neither here nor there. Then he segued into the trials and tribulations of traveling by air I vowed then and there to surrender my Executive Platinum card and to have someone lower me into a well by my ankles. Ok boss?"
5,Can't stop telling my friends about it!!!!,I have been a Kevin Nealon fan it seems like forever...maybe just for a little while. I saw an interview that he did on Ellen & he was talking about the birth of his son. I kept rewinding the DVR because I was laughing and crying so hard that I could not hear what else he was saying. I had to do the exact same thing with Now Hear Me Out! Kevin is hillarious and he knows it. You can't go wrong with the DVD...no matter how many times you watch it...101 times. Thanks for the laughs Kevin....EVERYONE - tell your friends to tell their friends. That is what I have done!
1,Wow,"As a fan of Kevin Nealon's work on SNL and Weeds, I was absolutely stunned by the shear awfulness of his first stand-up special. It's not just the writing thats terrible and unfunny, but also his incredibly bad delivery. He's awkward (in a bad way) and uneasy throughout the special and lacks any of the character traits he expresses in his acting. This is not so much a stand up special as it is a list of talking points which Kevin fails to develop into humor. Watching the first five minutes it became clear to me that Kevin Nealon only got a special because of his work on Weeds, he has no place in stand-up. I beg everyone who enjoys Kevin's work on SNL and Weeds on avoid this special!! It will seriously erode any respect and admiration you have for the man. It's clear after watching this that Kevin Nealon is not so much a funny person as he is a funny actor. Stick to acting, Kevin, please."
3,Great First Time Around,This wasn't the first time I've seen Kevin Nealon's Now Hear me Out! I caught the majority of it late one night on tv and I've been interested ever since. The DVD unfortunately wasn't side aching funny considering that I've heard most of the jokes before but it is pretty family friendly and it's something that I would enjoy sharing with friends.
5,I think that this is a good book,"I think the book was good, but it could have ended differently. For instance, instead of being on the boat and Uncle Pinchbeck finding the boy it should have ended where when they came back the uncle had the family at gun point and then there was a struggle between the boy and the uncle and it ended up the uncle died from the gun going off. So that way it would had made it more interesting and there would have been more action in it.To me I think that the characters were believable. I would have thought that this really happened because of all the detail and all the stuff that happened and how they reacted and even the way they sounded was convincing enough.I would recommend this book because it's not gory. For instance there aren't bodies everywhere, and blood and stuff like that isn't everywhere. So I think I would recommend it. Plus it is even school appropriate."
4,A middle school student from Liberty Middle School,"We read the book ""Return to Treasure Island."" Oddly Enough, I enjoyed it, that's pretty strange because I don't usually find adventure books entertaining. One of the parts I found interesting is that Jonathan and his new found family did not just live ""happily-ever-after"", and would not have guessed that his mother would have been ill, and weak, and I also would not have guessed that the person that jumped out of the bush would have been the dad. I give this book 4 stars."
1,Poor Return Policy,"If you own a Husqvarna 142 chain saw be aware that the chain sold here is a 91VG052G. It is not the same size chain as the 91VG052 which is the one listed in the owner's manual. I ordered the 91VG052 and the chain sent to me was the 91VG052G. By the time I was ready to use it and found out it was too small it was too late to return it because Mowtownusa has a 10 day return policy, not a 30 day policy like Amazon. I contacted Mowtownusa to double check on their return policy but they never replied back to me. I highly recommend NOT buying anything through this company. It is too bad that Amazon is directing its customers to this outfit."
5,good stuff,this is good lithium grease. i put it on all my ground blocks and distribution blocks in my boat. it keeps the corrosion away and repells water..
3,"Great reference work, could use more detail","This is a great reference work, although I could have used a little more detail to solve my particular problem. Cleared up some of my misconceptions on how grounded systems came about. Definitely a must for anyone doing electrical work."
2,Entertaining but unfulfilling,"While the history covers the full length of Nova Scotia's history, it is very anecdotal in nature. As a result I found it very disjointed. The lack of a map was also keenly felt. Even though Choyce often supports his theme of the great influence of the sea on Nova Scotia, the gaps in the narrative greatly weaken the impact. If you want a series of short excerpts of Nova Scotia's history, I can recommend this book. However, it is not up to giving much insight into the why of the province's history."
4,"Good, but....","It took me forever to find this film at a decent price. When I got it, it worked well, and I am just really happy to have this movie as it's one of my favorites. However, when I got it, it smelled like plastic and from the printing on the DVD it was really clear that the seller had printed this themselves. I'm not sure that they have the authorization to do that, but I am sure that it was printed by them."
3,incomplete subtitles,"The dvd does play in the various languages as stated. Depending on one's need or expectation though.....the English subtitles are incomplete. I gave it as a gift to my Italian instructor, only to find out when viewing it in Italian with English subtitles (for his classes) the subtitles are incomplete. It doesn't have subtitles for all the dialogue and for each character speaking. If this isn't a need or a factor, you will be very happy with the DVD."
3,A Revenge...ful thriller,"The wife of a greedy man comes back to haunt him after he drivers her to hang her herslef. But, is she really a ghost, or is she now playing mind games similar to those he played on her?"
4,Snoopy nursery valance,"This Window Valance goes perfectly with the bedding and the decor of the nursery. Highly recommend, but be aware the material is very thin."
4,very funny and great movie/novela,"Is def missing some episodes, but hey! it summarizes most of it. My brother and dad loved it and didn't mind the episodes left out. thanks"
4,Gift,This was a gift for someone. Talked to the person I gave it to and he really enjoys it.It was in the exact condition that was stated.
1,Pitty,They took the pleasent sound of a stream and than ruined it with old sappy songs. I was lucky enough to find someone to give it away to who would like it. I wish on the discriptions they would put if it has music or not. Thanks
4,"great band, good album","Lynx was a fun band to watch. There drummer is very talented but strange. One guitarist was left handed, the other right, and they kinda looked like brothers. They would stand on either side of the drummer with identical guitars (besides the fact that one was lefty...) and do great counterpoint guitar work. Truely fun to watch. The bassist who went on to play for check engine in chicago was amazing. Anyhow, this record is the best thing recorded of theirs that I know of. Pretty dry production, and nothing fancy really. The songs are good though, and played well. Very indy, very complex = A+"
5,"Ah, Lynx.","It's tragic that virtually no one outside of Chicago or Boston will ever hear this album. It is a masterpiece of instrumental ""math-rock"" : a subgenre of alt rock characterized by oft-shifting time signatures, melodic guitar arpeggiations, and propulsive, showy drumwork. What distinguishs this release from those by similar bands (Shellac, Don Caballero) is a lack of austerity/pretension and a wealth of melodic invention (comparable at times to Mozart). Mark my words - my band will one day cover one of these nine masterful compositions on national television."
4,Killer Math Rock,"Lynx originally hail from Boston, MA and then relocated to Chicago where they recorded their one and only full length with the legendary Bob Weston. If you're a fan of Don Caballero, Oxes, or Shellac - check out Lynx!"
5,Great Live Arab Strap Album,"Essential live recording of this band, recorded in London in 1998. Features amazing versions of ""New Birds"" and ""Girls of Summer,"" which alone are worth the price of the CD. If you are an Arab Strap fan, you must own this. If you are new to this Scottish band, this is a brilliant introduction to their stark, introspective, and often acid mixture of folk and rock music. Fabulously good."
1,POOR QUALITY,THIS IS PRETTY MUCH A TERRIBLE PRODUCT. VERY CHEAP AND THE MICROSCOPE HAS ZERO VISIBILTY AND FOCUS.
1,SPEND THE MONEY AND GET A BETTER ONE!,"This telescope did not work at all, my daughter was so disappointed. You could not see anything at all and the instructions are useless. How about they sell a product that may cost a little more but actually works. We feel like we got ripped off. The worst part is that the kids are so excited to get this item and then it doesn't work. Either make a good one or don't sell the item."
4,Love it but it is thick!!,This blanket is super cute. I bought it before knowing whther or not I was having a boy or girl. I couldn't find any girl puppy items so thought this would work if I had a girl.The blanket is great but super thick. My baby is hot natured so there is little opportunity to use this blanket.
5,A great voice and talent,"When you first hear Brett James, his unique vocal talent immediately comes through. I cannot emphasize enough that ""Dark Side of the Moon"" is absolutely outstanding and remains among my favorite two-step songs and friends who have heard it unanimously agree. I introduced the track to a DJ buddy who now frequently plays it at his club and gets inquiries about it all the time. A strong presentation and very good album overall.Although not on this album, his version of ""What Child Is This"" is also one of the best renditions I've heard and ""What a Friend We Have in Jesus"" is truly heartfelt. If you ever come across these songs, take a listen.I really wonder why he didn't make it big. Whatever happened to him???"
3,Swingin',"Some killer tracks here, but don't be fooled by the few 12"" mixes. I don't remember any 12"" tracks being just 4 minutes short! :-( This aint nearly as DJ-friendly as it shoulda been"
1,Doesn't run on a modern machine,"This game, evidently, is designed for an older operating system (Win 95/98). Though the package claims it will work on Win2k for instance, it doesn't. The website for the game is defunct. The patches can't be downloaded. It's sad. Douglas Adams is such a beloved author, why don't they care about this game?"
3,Playing starship titanic in newer versions of Windows,"I originally got Starship Titanic when I had Win 95. When I upgraded to XP, the game still played until SP2. I tried the patches which were not satisfactory, and finally retired it. When I upgraded to Win 7, I decided to try the game again. I typed "" will Starship Titanic play on Windows 7"" into my browser and got a tech geek site that told me how to configure to play the game. The original patch and the Cinepac Codec are still available at the Starship Titanic website. The updated sh33w32.dll driver is available from MacKichan Software. Just load all the patches into your digital Villge file and you are up and running. good luck!"
1,Can't make it work on Windows 7,"I played this game when I was much younger and it's pretty brilliant. Challenging puzzles, a dialog system where you can type whatever you want, funny robots, beautiful setting and a neat plot underneath it all -- all classic Douglas Adams. But unfortunately, since the company that made it went out of business ages ago, it's very hard to get it to work on modern machines. Running Windows 7, I've tried a variety of patches and compatibility modes to no avail. I think if I can set up a virtual machine running Windows 95 I might get it to work. Bottom line -- unless you have significant experience with computers and are willing to do some legwork to make this game work, you shouldn't buy it."
3,"No videos, wanted to play it so bad too.","I didn't want to pay full price for this game so I waited....then it finally came out in stores again....with a strategy guide bundled. So it was the same price as before. I waited more. Never saw it in stores again. Finally I ordered it for dirt cheap the other day. I installed it and found the same issue another user reported. None of the avi files in the game play. Kind of ruins it. Accordin to the other review you have to uninstall XPSP2 and go back to SP1. Not gonna happen. Oh well. Btw, I'm a huge Douglas Adams fan and have read all of the Hitchhiker and Dirk Gently books."
5,"If Adams is part of it, it must egood, and it is","its a videogame, co written by Douglas Adams, if thats not enugh for you, then you obviously dont know much about him. Every character can be spoken to in the closest to a real conversation as possible. The puzzles are uniquem the dialoge is funny, and its just a good game, so get it now."
1,Disappointed,"This game will NOT run under Windows XP or 2000. The box states it is compatible, but the reality is blackouts and screen freezes with audio antics. Glad I didn't spend any more than I did."
1,My Titanic Won't Fly,"So disappointed! I had looked forward to playing this game for so long. Finally got it, installed it and then...nothing. Every time I would click ""Play"", it would go back to my desktop screen.I tried all 3 sizes of install options. I made sure I had the current DirectX...nothing. I have played at least 30 other games, of all types and sizes, on my computer. But not this one. I went to the SST site, where they offered a patch. The patch page was no longer accessible. Okay...I went to the SST Forum. Talked to a couple of folks about my situation. No luck. I even purchased another copy, of the game, which I had thought would be a newer version. Same version.I do agree with the other reviews in that it is no doubt a great game...if only I could play it!"
4,"Sturdy, but really thick when full","Case Logic Rip & Burn Nylon Wallet, Capacity 34Very sturdy, but the outside pockets are very tight and you probably won't use them for CD's. However, room enough to add more in slip cases - I have 10 more in there than the 34 pockets available. I would order more at this price. Great for storing my Lord of the Rings, HP & Twilight Series Audio Books."
1,This is an unnecessary book,"I don't feel tempted to write a review very often but for this book I do. It is a warning: Don't buy this book. There are an awfull lot of better books about XML, XML Schema's and XSLT around (try Wrox) and the book doesn't tell you anything about XML spy (which is a great product!) that you can't find out with an hour or so of clicking around and trying the features.More important: It doesn't even mention the more interesting features of XML Spy that do seem to require a manual: Extending the product by writing macro's for instance or this Authentic stuff.For me, unfortunately, it was a waste of time and money."
3,Useful but not a great book,"I just finished this book cover to cover.One should keep in mind while reviewing any literature on xmlspy, that there is a wealth of things one can do with this tool. And that it takes huge volumes to cover all those details.Considering that this 326 page book has done a good job.The book will definitely get you started.Only the first 250 pages are useful. The chapters on WSDL, SOAP are too abstract to be of any use.Also in the first 250 pages, the 2 chapters on XSTL are not done well. I was surprised to see a lot of dead code in the snippets printed.I also came across a lot of printing errors.Oh yeah the CD provided is for some dummies series XML book. The software was unusable.So you are actually buying a book with around 150 pages. But I will still spend that money if I am given the opportunity to decide once again.Hopefully there will be a revised 2nd edition."
3,CD-ROM contains outdated version of XMLSPY,"The book advertises a special 90-day trial version of XMLSPY 5 Enterprise Edition, however, the accompanying CD-ROM I received with the book has version 4.3, and Professional, not Enterprise. Makes me wonder whether the code samples included by the author are also outdated. Hope the book's content is more useful than the CD-ROM's."
4,My son's favorite,I just bought a second one - our first was a little threadbare after three years of daily loving. This is my son's favorite thing to sleep with and hold for comfort.
5,Katelynn Chickee Buttt,"Because there are Nicknames for my Grandchildren ( Chickee Buttt ) the little Plush chicken was absolutley perfect. But since I had already bought 2 for my Grandsons, I felt I needed to ad the little Red Bow for my Grandaughter along with a tiny leather tag with her name.E L Smith"
3,The Mouse Book,"It was quite worn out, but it had been a library book, so it was well used. It was still readable."
4,Good collection of mystery stories,"For fans of good mystery writing, this book is a welcome addition to your library. There are a few stories in it that did not pull me in as much as others, but it still was an enjoyable read. With 15 stories of murder, intrigue, obsession and betrayal by various authors, this book should appeal to everyone who likes a good mystery."
5,One of the top 3 cds I own,This CD is perfect when I need to relax and for background music during a dinner party. I love exposing other people to it-the music is uplifting and quieting.
3,Purchased for one song,"I love me some Mary J Blige so whatever she sings, I got to have a copy and this was the ONLY way to get it!"
5,This used to be my older sister's favorite...now It's MINE!,"This is a really cool cartoon from the ""Jungle Book"" (not Disney) series. In ""The Cold Fang,"" Moglii gets caught in a bear trap while running in the woods. The anamation might not be that good, but at least this movie isn't cheezy or stupid!!!"
1,Don't waste your effort to view this one!,One of the world's worst directed and edited films ever put on market! Very choppy in it's editing; Ms. Jacob's dialogue very difficult to understand at times; the acting is atrocious!
2,Not feeling this toy,"I'm not feeling this toy and neither is my 2-year-old.The pieces are on the small side and even with the most advanced fine motor skills, the pieces are hard for younger children to maneuver.There are also too many pieces to keep track of. My son uses the main characters to play with in the tub and that's about it.Cute toy, just not practical or a favorite in my household."
3,"Great Concept, Bad Execution",We have this same camper but ours only came with Elmo and Cookie Monster. The concept of this toy is really cute but there are some definite flaws. It is hard for my 18 month old to get the people in and out of the car and he gets frustrated often or disinterested. Elmo and Cookie also are chipping all over the place. Durability is not great. I wouldn't buy this toy again.
2,Dogmatic,"I read this text while a student in a class taught by Mr. Poulson at The University of Colorado six years ago. I recently picked up the book again for some insight into some research I am currently doing. Mr. Poulson's writing is mired in dogmatic storytelling. I guess as a naive 21 year old undergraduate I was unable to realize the extent to which the writing lacks substantive evidence. In short, this is a volume filled with the sheltered right-wing fantasies of someone who never steps outside of Boulder County Colorado. Given the numerous alternatives available to students in this field, I would highly recommend this text be skipped entirely."
3,"Some essentials, some surprises, some passes","No...the previous reviewer is not correct in asserting that the songs on here are on Nuggets. Some important ones are, but not all of them. Actually some very very essential songs are in this box which do not appear on the Nuggets series.That is not to take away anything from the brilliant Nuggets box sets. They are great. But not the end all.I must admit, there is quite a bit of British psych which I will take a pass on...especially the horrendous endulgence on the harder edged soul/r&b/pysch fusions from 68-72. Some of this stuff appears on Nuggets as well.Some great stand outs here though by Cymbaline/Spencer Davis Group/The Attack/Wild Silk and others which you wont find on Nuggets.I do agree with other poster though...get your hands on some Sundazed Records issued stuff...coming in October...THE GURUS!!!"
1,CliffsComplete Othello,"Save your money. This study edition of Shakespeare's Othello is attractively laid out, with footnotes in the margins and helpful-looking commentary, but closer inspection reveals sloppy writing with many typos, misplaced modifiers, and (most importantly) serious misinterpretations of the play. Author Kate Maurer clearly needed a good editor, and did not get one. I wanted to throw my copy across the room!Shakespeare deserves better and so do you. Skip this shoddy piece of work and find a better study edition for your Othello studies."
3,Not the Best but Not the Worst Either,"It will never be my favorite Erasure album but all in all its pretty good. Its the first album that Erasure has put out that I didnt enjoy all the tracks to. Freedom, Here in My Heart, Love is the Rage, Catch 22, and Moon in the Sky make the album worth buying. The other songs were a bit unusual for my taste and the bass line seemed to be too much on all of the pieces. I think if you are an Erasure fan it is a ""must have"" just because the sound is so different."
2,"Poor, bordering on lame, sound mastering","I would have given this CD 4/5 stars. It's certainly no Chorus. But it is as good or better than Cowboy. Glaring problems drag down a stellar effort from Andy and Vince.The main problem with it is that whoever mastered the CD for postpreduction botched the job. The sound is muddy with the bass pushed way up front. The rest of the sounds and vocals are often hidden by the bass. If you've heard the tracks on Napster and thought the bad sound was due to a low sampling rate, well, you're wrong. They really do sound like crap.Now, don't get me wrong, there are great songs on here. ""Here in my Heart"" and ""Perchance to Dream"" come to mind very quickly, but because of the sound problems, I can't listen to the album without cringing.Shame on Mute for releasing such an obvious error."
2,two stars just because the cd is pretty,"Erasure is a great duo, not doubt about it..but when I I first listened to ""Loveboat"" I instantly had to turn down the bass. I tried it on every stereo I could get my hands on..no luck!...yes its in the mixing! There are times you cant even hear Andy's voice, Im dissapointed that the Napster files sound better than the cd quality. This album has the potential to be the best ever, its just annoying, like torture, that the bass overwhelms Andy's beautiful voice. Its a struggle to filter it out..making this album a real tease........(You diehard fans will enjoy it..yes we have to have every cd of Erasure), but someone who is just looking to sample some current Erasure, no....check out their ""self titled"" album, or even ""Chorus"". you wont be dissapointed in those two."
1,Bass way too loud to hear anything!,It is a nice album if only you could hear it. The bass was recorded way too loud. Flood-get a grip!
2,What Happened?,"How dissappointing. Their last album was the pinnacle of their career in my opinion, and then this.....Bland, limp and terribly mixed. It's as if they recorded it on a boom box in their bedroom. There are a few catchy hooks, spread throughout, but I stretched so hard to find melody and feeling in this, and it didn't work. I'm going to allow them another chance though. 15 years of consistent energy, melody, and magic.....this will be their ""miss"". Go back to the studio boys, and do what you know best! Fun!"
5,A great album,"This is certainly comparable to Erasure or Chorus, while Chorus is more of the 80s sound, Loveboat is definitely the music of 2000 ... Comparing Erasure album with Madonna/Orbit production is very wrong. Of course, Madonna will always get a better promotion (from hypes and all), b/c of her early works, which are still far better than her later works.But listening to the last two Madonna cds, admittedly there are a few good songs, Loveboat is certainly has far better melody and catchy tunes, compare to the flat trance tune of Madonna's. I am also a Beatles fan, and I know a good melody/tune from a bad one.Please make your judgement after hearing the album for a few times, and listen it without prejudice at first"
3,Freedom is one of the best Erasure songs ever!,"There are actually three songs on this album I listen to: ""Freedom,"" which is a wonderful upbeat song with a great use of guitars, ""Perchance to Dream,"" which is reminiscent of Macy Gray, and ""Moon & the Sky,"" which is very techno-influenced. Aside from these, there are no other stand-out tracks. The others are quite boring in my opinion. It's very true that the recording/mixing is horrible. To listen to this album in my car, I have to turn the bass all the way down if I want to hear any of the other elements. The bass should be one of the LEAST emphasized elements of this album, except for maybe two songs that are upbeat.""Cowboy"" is still the best album in my opinion. I love every song on there except one or two of them."
1,Oh God! I'm so SORRY!,"Help! Can it be a mistake? I checked the name at least three times on the album to make sure it was ""Erasure"" and not a ripoff like ""Eraysure."" Alas, it is Erasure and I've been betrayed."
4,ERASURE AS GOOD AS EVER!,This cd is just another example of how erasure continues to grow as an artist. Each track is unique. Andy and Vince both experiment a little with different songs and the experiment pays off. A must have for any Erasure fan. Any new fan should still probably start off with Pop first. All in all a GREAT CD!
4,Great for the Faithful,"For those of us who still love the 80s and the bands that made it big in that decade another album has come. Erasure fans will not be disappointed with this album although they really won't expand their audience either. The album continues their trend towards eclectic collections, some the usual disco, some a bit slower. They can still turn out music of the same quality. Overall, if you're an Erasure fan, or a fan of this style of music, the album is worth getting. If you're on a tighter budget you might wish to wait and see if they release it in the US."
2,Not Bad Music,"I have heard every Erasure release to date. I was thoroughly disappointed in this release. The songs have great potential, but with the muffled singing and over the top bass, I could not get any feeling from the songs. Surprised, I must admit. I sincerely hope this is not the beginning of the end?"
3,After a long wait - Stale followup to Cowboy,"Loved Cowboy in 1997 and was excited by the notion that Erasure would be releasing another title soon this year. Ran out and bought the import and now after my 20th listen through I am beginning to like it. I would say there are 4 excellent songs with Here in My Heart being the strongest followed closely by Alien. The second track is abysmal and I tend to skip it. It sounds like Andy Bell on valium - monotonous whining at best.For Die hard Erasure fans - this should be a good enough fix for awhile, and we certainly hope they will tour to promote this CD (they will need to if they want any kind of sales in the US).I still enjoy the work of this band and will continue to follow them and buy everything they release because when they hit everything just right - it is like heaven listening to Andy Bell's voice and Vince's keyboards."
4,good but not whole,"it is a good book for german students who are speak english.through understand the german words bulding principle,i can study german new words faster than before.but in this book,it only introduces german prefixes and suffixes.if it has a part of german root,i feel it will be great.and its print is out of date,like a notebook."
2,"Unfriendly, but good for advanced practice","Cons:1) Definitely not for beginners, it presuposes a more than basic understanding of German grammar and vocabulary.2) Extremely brief explantions before the execises. If you are a beginner, you'd better look for a frendlier book; if you are intermediate, they can only serve as a reminder of what you already know.3) Rustic, typewriter style. Accents and umlaugs are handwritten, letters have varying darkness and thickness, no images or visual aids whatsoever.4) Keys at the end of the book are compressed, apparently to save space, making it more laborious to verify some of them.Pros:1) Plenty of exercises.I'd only recommend it to german speakers who stopped practicing for a long period of time and now want to recover vocabulary by doing plenty of written exercises."
5,Wonderful!,"This book is really great. It teaches German students how to increase their vocabulary by learning the German suffixes and prefixes to add to the existing vocabulary that the student is already familiar with. By learning what each suffix and prefix means, the student need only concern him/herself with the main root of the word. From there the student can invent legitimate German words based on the knowledge gained from this book. In German, it is often very easy to create new words based on the words already known to the speaker & with the help of this book, it becomes a little bit easier. The various suffixes and prefixes are defined & explained and the author describes how each suffix and how each prefix changes the meaning of a root word. I love this book!!"
1,"If you want to waste time, this is the way to go.","I as at a friend of mine's house when her kids popped this little number in the VCR. Not long after, they were bounding around while I sat helplessly. Roger G. seemed to show how to dance with an oragutan, and the dancing kids showed only an obvious fraudelent enthusiasm. It was not fun at all."
1,Plastic bird bath?,"This would go great with your 3-color, double-wide trailer (with galvanized sheetmetal skirting). Heck, at this price the shipping cost more than the bird bath! I guess they really know what their products are worth."
1,Not as good as I expected,"I got this book because it was written by a professor of mine at the UWP. He is an amazing professor, but she keep his talents directed in that way. This book did not have what it takes to get and keep my interest, and i am an avid SCIFI fan, let alone someone who has only a minor interest in that aspect of the book. I did not feel like i could connect with the characters, and did not think that any of them were particularly well developed. This book feels like those that you know are written in a rush, but i know for a fact that he spent nearly 15 years writing it. I think he is a wonderful man, but he sould have kepet this one burried in the computer files where it belongs."
1,Ho. HUM.,"I HAVE all of these!! Why the heck do they keep making these ""Collectors Editions"" with the same darn episodes!! I want to see season 4 and UP episodes. I agree with other comments about that. WHY NOT MAKE SEASONS!! Other shows are done that way. STUPID shows have seasons, why can't an entertaining Icon like THIS one have seasons?!!!!"
3,Missing Joseph,Didn't enjoy this as much as many of Elizabeth George's books. It seemed too slow and the characters are not all that loveable.
2,Not Who? Why?,"This is the third George ""mystery"" I have read following Deception on His Mind and A Great Deliverance. While I find George to be a talented writer, I almost didn't finish this book. At first I felt drawn into the story, but by the end I didn't care. It wasn't just the length, although it was certainly too long, but the boredom on my part. The mystery wasn't a ""who done it"" but rather a ""why did she do it."" (This is the same type of effect used in A Great Deliverance.) Havers remains nebulous, Linley is a bore, and let's not even mention Lady Helen--please. The victim never quite becomes three dimensional. I know at the beginning there would be something about adoption given the St. James's problems so that wasn't even a suprise. I will not read any further George mysteries. While the individual parts are interesting, the whole is disappointing and not worth the effort to read it. This is sad because I've also been turned off on Martha Grimes as well!"
3,Get ON with it!,"I'm 80% through this book and it is just now getting around to developing a reason for Sage's murder. This plot is dragging on and on with no developments.Meanwhile, Little Deb continues to wreck her marriage and Helen is trying her best to wreck her own chances for one. I wish Lynley would do what his father would have done to that lowlife rapist constable. At least something would be happening. If only his blood were a little less blue.This is not the best in the series. I'm reading them in order and this one is by far the worst so far. Havers is the only one with any life in her, and her circumstances are enough to squeeze the life out of anyone. Her rough edges are the only thing that holds any promise for the remainder of this book."
2,OK? Does Havers EVER Get a Life?,"I started reading this series on my mother's recommendation... she told me that the mysteries were very romantic and that there was a very interesting woman character (Havers) and an English lord who develop a wonderful relationship....NOT! Come on, Mom! Havers is the most abused heroine I've ever encountered. How many times has George described her with a bovine adjective? I keep reading these books waiting for Havers to ""Get a Life"" but I am not sure that she will ever be so generously rewarded. Meantime, I have to wade through every PC topic known to mankind... incest, abortion, child abuse, teen sex... whatever sells."
4,Another Great George Book,"From its poetic beginning to its haunting completion, this is a stunning work. George, in her early works, has a way of building scenes that almost makes the characters secondary. The opening scene in the art museum really is as good as anything she's ever written; both Deborah St. James and Robin Sage are linked, more than anything, by that opening setting.The story unfolds masterfully from there. The characters are intriguing without being one-dimensional, and the mystery is pretty complex -- so much so that I nearly gave up in the middle because I thought I had figured it out and could jump to the end. Continuing to read, however, I learned how wrong I was in my early conclusions and how well George tied everything together so the ending is both shocking and foretold."
5,PHOTOS OF THE DECADE,"This book, and the others in the series--1920s through the 1970s--are remarkable for their vast array of photos depicting just about every aspect of each decade. They are MORE than worth the price! The photos are accompanied by descriptions and these ""little"" books are BIGGER than you think when you start them!"
5,The previous review is INCORRECT,"Though this book has a lot of pictures from England, etc., it definitely includes the U.S., Russia, and other European countries. I believe these books are a fun and informative slice of history for those of us who weren't there. They are definitely worth more than they cost."
5,Awesome :-),"Awesome is such a cliche but it really is the most fitting description for this incredible cd. It matches an equally amazing and awesome show that has to be seen to believed. I love this music. It's beautiful and haunting, and is the kind of music you can have on in the car, background at a dinner party, to have on while you read, or just play whenever. It's stunning and having seen Ka in Vegas a year ago, it brings back the memories of the second best show I've ever seen in my life (the best show is O). If you've seen Ka or even if you haven't, you'll love this because it's so beautiful and unique and so enjoyable. I highly recommend this. PS. The cd cover is so cool. Love that too."
3,"Great Show, Great Music, Terrible Transfer","First off, this show is awe inspiring and the music is just as memorable. So after seeing the show I picked up the soundtrack.The music is just not of good quality on the disc, sounds very grainy if you will. It sounds like they blared the music in the theater and recorded it all on one mic. Im really disappointed because if you listen to it at any loud volume at all it becomes really noticeable. There are also a few audible hicupps.Considering all the money they make on this show, you would think they could afford a decent transfer, this is not CD quality music, its casette at best, maybe 8-track..."
4,Strong and refresh music,"I own several Cirque Du Soleil's CDs, this comes to my 2nd favorite. My all time favor of Cirque Du Soleil is Varekai because of its story line, the composition of the music, needless to say, the Fire Within on Bravo TV.KA is good as well, but I just don't like that last few pieces, specifically, my ears just don't do well with that female singer's voice. Nothing against her personally, just don't feel right to hear her voice.The choir is great, music is great, if you can listen with good sound system, you should be able to feel the battle field.It has the 5-star potential if they have different female singer."
3,not what I expected,"of course, since it's from Cirque, I should know better than to have expectations. The CD's music is darker than I expected, so it wasn't quite what I was hoping for. If you've seen this show, you probably know what to expect, but if you haven't, this isn't as light as many of their other CDs."
5,KA Music,"The cd was everything I expected it to be. The music is fantastic, it was like seeing the show all over again. I love it!"
2,Too old to help,"I bought this book because I found that Gann maintained the author's name on his list of books to read. However, I did not find any useful information from a trading perspective. He does a decent job in covering directional astrology though, which is the title of the book after all. However, I think the information is old and is already available on the internet for free. I love old books and enjoy collecting them, but I think this book has outdated information now and shouldn't be bought by your average consumer."
1,Cheap plastic crap,"I'm shocked at the quality of these. My house had them in it when I moved in, and they were jacked, so I needed replacements right away so I could shower. They are shockingly expensive. But, I would be fine with that if the craftsmanship was superior. It's not at all. It's a 50/50% mixture of metal and plastic. The hinge that holds the wand and let's you title the wand up and down is plastic. It feels so flimsy I try to avoid using it at all, and warn guests about it. The wand has fewer spray options than you're average $50 wand. I just don't understand this. I will definitely be focusing on quality construction the next time I have to replace these."
4,Limited Channel Entry,The remote control has no provisions to manualy enter the dash in a channel number. You can only enter the main channel number. I don't believe the main unit will allow this either.
5,F@#% What Ya Heard!!!,You call yourself a hip hop head right? Get w/this if ya haven't. Nothin but the realness. Perfectly done beats w/ top-notch lyrics. Cop it while you can because it gets harder to find everyday. A must own from the golden era. Peace!
3,"Looks great, don't mess with it once hung.","My daughter was excited to receive the banner, it looks great hung up. I wouldn't recommend messing with it, just hang it up and leave it. The plastic pole and string could break easily, and the fabric is a think felt type fabric. Looks great up, nothing else."
3,A few great tips,This book has a few good tips in it but it will really only help beginners. If you have ever been skiing more than three times you will probably know everything that is in here.
3,Looking For Love,"I enjoy reading the Stephanie Plum Novels, and recently learned of Ms. Evanovich's romance novels. Not much of a romance novel genre fan as a whole, however this one wasn't too bad.I think Janet Evanovich is a great writer and I like the story line of this novel. Some of the scenes between the lead characters were pretty funny. Other scenes with the main characters were annoying--- the main characters were attracted to each other but neither of them was ready to admit that to the other person for most of the novel, which got old quick."
1,Way different from Plum,"Love the Stephanie Plum series, but this was terrible. I usually stick with the worst books no matter what, but I gave up on this one after stomaching 2/3rds of it. She had something, a glimmer of setting, character...but it was cheesy, patronizing, insipid, ridiculous, cliche...icky boring mess. The daffy but determined heroine, the strong, manly man...and in two days of cliches, they realize they love each other. Ugh. This is a book for a thirteen year old girl, except for the abundant soft porn sex."
2,Not the Book I Downloaded!,"This book by Janet Evanovich is not what I downloaded. I originally downloaded Manhunt: The 12 Day Chase to Catch Lincoln's Killer, but it was taken out of the Kindle store and it was replaced on my Kindle with this one instead."
3,Just ok,"This was just an ok read for me. I thought the characters were undeveloped, the writing was simple and the romance was just mediocre. Do yourself a favor and check it out from the library."
3,Manhunt,"It was pretty good you have to remember it is one of J.E. first books, at least before the Plum books."
1,extremely disappointing,"so glad she went on to the Plum series, which I absolutely love. Manhunt is certainly superfluff, boring, silly silly silly. did not like it at all. Back to Plum PLEASE! This book being 'reissued' is no favor to Evanovich lovers. A real letdown. I guess she had to start somewhere and she has indeed honed her skills to 5 stars with her later books."
1,a yawn,"My review may be unfair since I quit reading at page 70 when I admitted to myself that I was bored out of my mind and couldn't find any enthusiasm to go further. If anything interesting happens after page 70, it's too late anyway."
2,Kindle Version - No Maps or Photographs,"I was very disappointed with the publisher of this book in that they did not include any of the photographs or maps found in the hardback or paperback versions of this book. The Kindle is quite capable of handling photos, so why were they left out?? The photos and maps play an important part in the story and I was very disappointed to see that they were missing. Otherwise, in the first two chapters that I've read, the story is very good and one that is of great interest. I'm guessing that when I'm done I'll be very pleased with the book, but I would send a word of caution to those considering buying the Kindle version."
4,Cute!!!,This really was a cute story. I can see a lot of the same in her Plum series...food and accident prone!!!This was cute story...short too!!! Something from Evanovich early days. But worth reading.I am glad she re-released this one...have enjoyed all of them...looking forward to Smitten.This would be a great stocking stuffer!!!
4,Research,"It might be a good idea goods little more research before publishing a book nationwide. Raccoon do not live in Alaska and the wet areas in the interior are not muskeg they are peat bogs or permafrost swamps. The proper term for multiple birch trees is birch not birches.The book was very entertaining, with very descriptive writing. The harnesses for dogs are nylon not leather"
1,Wrong Book,You have listed the wrong book. I purchased Manhunt by James Swanson. It is the story of the hunt for John Wilkes Booth and a terrific piece of historical writing that a student of the Civil War will find fascinating.
4,Manhunt,What a great read...strong woman tricking a man like we do..smiled every timei picked the book up. Love it
5,I love it,"Janet Evanovich keeps you wanting to keep reading, I love here books. I have read all the number up to Notorious"
3,Beware the Kindle Edition of Manhunt,"Not one of the 18 illustations (maps, photos, etc.) that are in the paper edition of this book is included in the Kindle edition. And there is no disclaimer to that effect when you buy it. Totally irritating. There is a list of the illustrations at the beginning of the Kindle book and the photo captions are included in the Kindle edition - but the images themselves are absent. I feel ripped off. The Kindle Reader is fully capable of displaying photos, so this omission is puzzling.Followup: Amazon agreed to refund my purchase price and I appreciate that. I'll go to the library this weekend and find a hardcopy of the book so that I can study the photos and maps that were not in the Kindle edition."
3,"Early Janet, I was fooled by the re-release",This is a cute book. I liked reading about Alaska. The story was somewhat predictable.The 2 main characters meet and instant attraction. They fall for eachother with resistance and so on..... I do like Evanovichs' quirky mishaps. But I still prefer the Stephanie Plum series.
3,Light Read,I bought this to take on vacation and to help pass the time until the next Stephanie Plum novel. It was a quick read and enjoyable. I could see a lot of the later Plum novels in the situations and dialogue.
3,Manhunt,funny...funny...funny...nuf said. Just when I think that Janet Evanovich can't top her last work somehow or other she does. I love her books. Very entertaining.
3,Good but not as good as the Plums,Easy read and would have probably liked it better if I had not just finished the whole Plum series which are WONDERFUL!
5,Manhunt,"This story was terribly entertaining. I would be stopped at a stop light while listening to the story laughing out loud while people looked at me like I was nuts. The story ends pretty much as expected, but the road to that end is hysterical!"
4,Love in Alaska,"Although I like Janet Evanovich's more recent offerings, her early romance novels are a lot of fun, too. This one is a trifle different, starting out with a savvy city girl who sets out to find a husband in the untamed wilds of Alaska. Although the heroine makes some mistakes in this challenging place that land her in some wacky situations, she manages to use her vice-president-of-a-big-company brains and experience to tame both her environment and marriage-shy man of her dreams. The title and cover were initially a bit off-putting to me, but I'm glad I read it because it is a rather interesting take on the traditional romance."
1,Giving up on Janet E.,"If you looking for funny characters entangled in a quirky fast-moving story line, this isn't it! I'm giving up on Janet E."
4,a fun read!,"It's pretty much what you might expect. A formulaic romance novel with a happy ending, but I enjoyed it. I liked that it was set in Alaska. All in all, the story kept me interested throughout and sometimes it's just nice to read something a bit lighthearted. I definitely liked it better than some of the other romance novels by the same author."
1,PATHETICALLY BORING!!,This book is so boring. It has no plot whatsoever and it is a waste of time to read.
4,A SUMMER READ,"MAINE SQUEEZE, written by Catherine Clark is a very good book. It is about a girl, whose parents leave the country and travel to the opposite side of the world for a summer vacation. Colleen had four of her bestfriends stay in her house for the summer, and they have a lot of fun. Along the way, there are many twists and events ranging from boys, to parties and fights. This summer, Colleen is very happy with her current boyfriend, Ben. But what happens if her summer love from last year comes back for the summer? Two boys, and one girl: the perfect summer.This book is a very good book, and is very fun to read. However, I would only recommend it if you are female. This is because it would most likely be classified as a ""chick flick."" This book is enjoyable to read because it reminds you of a summer that you would love to have; parents on the other side of the world, four best friends living with you, and boyfriends. I think you should read this book."
2,Surprisingly horrible!,"This book turned out to be completely diferent then I expected. It starts off with a good story line and then the book takes a turn for the worst. Don't get me wrong, I read this entire book in one sitting, but only in hopes that the story would do another about face and actually turn back into the story I had hoped it would be. The ending was not predictable at all, and for the first time I find that this quality takes away from the book. Despite the unpicturesque turn of events, the book basically just ends. If you like books that focus more on the shallow, slutty aspects of teenage discovery then this is the book for you. If not this book would be a waste of time and valueble book shelf space."
2,typical beach read,"This book was exactly what I thought it would be. An easy & predictable read. It was very forgettable to be honest, but I read it in 3 days. I contemplated not finishing it but I decided to. It was so predictable, I could have told you the ending by the end of the 3rd chapter. I found the main character to be annoying. I also felt that the author tried to develop each of the characters but didn't succeed in doing so. Instead you ended up with a little bit of information about a whole bunch of characters instead of a lot of information on a few characters. It was really, really easy to read too which came in handy to get it over with quickly."
2,backpack,The quality is not so good. My daughter has had it for 2 months and already the top handle is breaking off. Otherwise it was cute.
4,Good product. Could use an extra pocket for a bottle though.,"My daughter especially likes a horse pattern. The backpack itself is a middle size and appears to be of a decent quality. However, it doesn't have a bottle compartment so every time your child gets thirsty she/he would have to reach inside of the backpack to get water. Besides, there is also a risk that the water can spill inside and damage the contents. Otherwise, it's a good product."
3,3 Stars for Pantera and Orgy,"Small selection of Alternative Metal hits. Collection is short with only 6 videos. But what do you want for 7 dollars? About a dollar or so a video. Though i wouldnt even pay a dollar for some of these videos ,they suck that bad. The first 4 arent good. The pantera video was really cool (...). Thats the reason I got this dvd- If you want a couple cool videos get it or if your looking for a specific video. Other than that its not worth it.Videos-Filter- Hey Man, Nice Shot from Short Bus (1995)Janes Addiction- Mountain Song from Nothings Shocking (1988)Faith No More- Midlife Crisis from Angel Dust (1992)Ministry- N.W.O. from Psalm 69 (1992)Pantera- Walk -from Vulgar Display of Power (1992)Orgy- Fiction (Dreams In Digital) from Vapor Transmission (2000)"
3,"Really,not to bad","The big draw here is Ministry. Never heard of them before but video is blow-away awesome; song is hard-core perfect for getting a tattoo. You know Pantera ""Walk""-excellent video. Forgotten but still very under-rated ""Faith No More, 'Midlife Crisis'"" 2ND for awesome on this disk."
1,dont waste your money,"I bought one of these for my son and to date it has not worked at all. Keeps freezing up. Battery wont charge. Basically its a waste of money. I sent mine back for a refund and wentto Best Buy and bought a Dynex for 150 bucks, a little more than I wanted to spend but it worked right out of the box which right away was na improvement, plus my son can use it easily.Do not buy this item, it is only a headache"
2,Not worth it!,"I got this as a gift for my little one and it had defective batteries which had to be replaced. This was evidently the second replacement as the unit had a battery recall in the past and they were not the originals anyway. So days later, new batteries arrive and they operate. Then the player stops reading the DVDs and freezes constantly. All in all, it was about a week of using it and I still hear my son ask me for this broken player. We sent it back for a refund and are looking for a replacement that is more reliable. Do not waste your time."
3,Too long tongs,"It's my fault. I need tongs about 12 inches. These are too long to use for cooking on the stove. I would also prefer silicone padding for my hands.They are great tongs if you need any this long. They just don't fill the bill for what I need, BUT - that is my fault, as they are exactly as advertised. I am sure I will use them at some point."
3,A little disappointing!,"The only ""call"" this toy makes is the knocking sound the bird makes with its beak while drilling in trees. The manufacturers claim that every Audubon Bird makes a ""real bird call"" when squeezed. While yes, it is an accurate sound that this bird creates, it isn't exactly a ""call."""
2,Didn't like it.,"Didn't like this book as much as the story I remember as a child. I think this book didn't tell the ""old-time"" story of the Little Boy that Cried Wolf. I know it is supposed to teach a lesson, but my 4 year old won't let me read it to him again because he says it is too scary."
1,Beware of the ending,"In hopes to help my 4 year old who complains about every injury she does and doesn't have I thought this would be a great lesson book for her. Wish I had read it before I sat and read it to her. The wolf eats the parents and children in the end. Totally inappropriate lesson book that killing people is the answer, he eats everyone in the book! I had to make up an ending once I started to read the end of it to her that it all was a joke because she was scared."
1,Not the original story!!,We decided to get this book thinking what a good lesson it would tell our 5 year old son. We were hoping it was the Aesop fable retelling with more pictures. We were very disappointed to find instead a totally different plot not suitable for a bedtime story since the wolf eats the people! First he eats the adults who scold the boy for lying then he eats the boy! The pictures leave no way to tell this story differently since they show left behind articles from those who were eaten. This book is better suited for an older reader or an adult.
1,Bad Commercial Policy,I need a copy of this story for my 4 year old daughter to stress the fact that she shouldn't cry unless something is truly wrong. In doing my due diligence and trying to see how this book appeared on the inside I found that although text will appear no full illustrations will show. Ergo I have no idea whether or not this book will be effective.Needless to say I'm buying another version.Shame on Pied Piper Paperbacks for not allowing parents to screen thei material for appropriatness.
1,Sick!,"This book was purchased for my son who is five to teach him about lying and telling the truth. It was not the way I remembered the story told as a child, actually I found it pretty sick! The wolf eats people and flosses his teeth with the bones of the people he eats. The pictures are pretty graphic, I really am surprised they were able to publish this book for children. I would look for the orginal story of the ""The Boy Who Cried Wolf"" I would not buy this copy!"
5,Awesome!,"I highly recommend this pedal, comes in simple effective packaging, allows for fade-ins and enhances solos. A great, durable pedal for any guitarist."
4,Smart fun,"When was the last time you smiled reading about Hancock, John Adams and Washington? You will while reading this book. Far from being scandalous, Last Refuge of Scoundrels takes the Revolution and gives a fun human twist to it. Did you know the Revolution was actually being run by a prostitute from behind the scenes? Or that Sam Adams had a flatulance problem? If you can accept the fact that the Founding Fathers were human beings, with agendas that weren't always high and lofty, this work of fiction will delight you. It's rare these days that a novel can bring intelligent insightful fun to the public. This one does."
1,This Book Grows Worse Every Time I Think About It,"I read this book this summer. It was neither a good nor entertaining read. The style is amateurish and the ""historical"" workings are grossly inaccurate. It really is a forgettable book. But I started thinking about this book a couple of weeks ago, after 9/11. The more I think of this, the angrier I get at Paul Lussier the hack writer. Not so much for ""the writer thinks it's clever"" sort of writing, but for propagating lies about the very foundation of our nation. I do not advocate censorship, but I do believe that ""entertainers"" like Mr. Lussier owes it to the public and posterity to at least portray things accurately. But Mr. Lussier has as much regard for truth as he does for well-written narrative, which is to say none at all. This book, by presenting its fiction as Truth, does everyone a disservice and is insulting to the very core of our nation's beliefs. Paul Lussier should be ashamed of himself."
2,A difficult book to get interested in.,I'm afraid that I do not share the view of others that this was an interesting read and point of view of the Revolutionary war. It was a struggle to keep reading and we quit about 1/2 way through. It could have been dumped in the harbour with the rest of the tea.
1,Not for the easily misled,"As many of the reviews in this list demonstrate, a book of this sort is apparently way beyond the intelligence of many readers. People think it must be true because it's in a book, and are rejoicing at this ""new kind of truth."" Hello?!? It's called fiction, people. And not very good fiction at that."
5,WHAT UNEXPECTED FUN!,"Yes, this is a smart, probing, important and trail-blazing book. But just as important (and surprising to me) is how FUN it is! I've always thought of the American Revolution as dull stuff -- distant, dusty, shrouded in museum-like gravity and peopled only with noble stiffs whose actions may have been revolutionary, but who lacked much in the way of colorful, humanizing attributes in and of themselves. Now, for the first time, the era has come alive for me (even Mel Gibson's film, PATRIOT, recycled all the same old cliches) and I actually want to know more. In fact, I've been shocked into realizing how little I (or we, as Americans) really know about the founding of our own country. I'm glad my re-awakening came in so entertaining a form. So, yes, while this is indeed a book with real depth and seriousness of purpose, it's also just plain fun -- easy to read, a definite page-turner, often hilarious, and completely accessible to even the most history-phobic. What a relief!"
5,A Magical Journey,This book makes the Revolutionary War a personal journey of an assortment of unique and beautifully drawn characters. It is refreshingly irreverent and constantly surprises. I can't recommend it highly enough.
2,Operation Earth,"Brinsley Le Poer Trench seems to have produced a work that is rather good. Usually his theories are to fantastical even for someone as myself that believes in the Ancient Astronaut theory. Usually he proposes a hollow earth theory in his works, but here he is more down to earth. His central theme for this book is that our creators (spacemen) have been in contact with our race for aeons, that they initiated the genesis of civilisation and that actually we were once their slaves. There is a rather unnecessary chapter at the beginning that is a story written to illustrate his view on alien influence on us. This would put you of, but reading further he actually makes a good case for his theory, particularly when describing that the human race is just an experiment, and that we are Infact on a kind of cosmic probation. Interesting point when you consider the similarity to the biblical last judgement story."
1,Annoyed,"These dumbbells arrived quickly but when I opened the package I saw two poorly molded hex dumbbells. The grips were ergonomic and comfortable but had burrs and chips near where they attach to the weight. Both of those downfalls are okay though because dumbbells don't have to be pretty, they only have to be heavy and weigh a certain amount. Well, that's why I am rating these dumbbells only 1 star. I ordered two 55 pound dumbbells. One of them weighs 50 pounds and the other weighs 52 pounds. I already have 50 pound dumbbells, I don't need another set of 50 pound dumbbells. Therefore, these were an absolute waste of money for me. Thank you China."
4,"Top Notch Historical Event, Timeline and People Reference","This ambitious effort by a team of editors and researchers at George Philip, Limited, is exactly as advertised--a comprehensive and illustrated compendium of people, dates and events in world history from 15,000 B.C. to 1999 A.D.Dates and events are listed chronologically by four geographical categories (Asia and Australasia, Africa, Europe, and the Americas) and two technical categories (Science and Technology, and Arts and Humanities). People in history are dealt with in a separate index, and include short biographical sketches of each. The index begins with Alvar Aalto, a French architect, and concludes with Vladimir Kosma Zworykin, a U.S. physicist. The book also has an extensive topical index.[the price] may be a tad steep compared to other similar reference works, but its 318 pages are packed with information, easily read, and replete with pictures and map detail where necessary."
2,Some work still needed,"It is quite obvious that they spent some time working on the quality of the picture. Now, if they had taken that much time and effort on correcting problems with the sound, then the shorts would be perfect. Railroadin' has a distinct hiss in the sound track and can make understanding the actors words difficult to understand. There are many ways sound can be improved and hiss reduced or eliminated and that has been done on other sound tracks, but it appears as if nothing was done to this short. This makes the set very disappointing in my opinion and would recommend anyone considering buying this set to put off the purchase until all of the problems have been resolved."
3,Our Gang in Transition,"The 1929-30 Our Gang talkies are finally available in chronological order, with Hal Roach's Rascals making a rather awkward transition to sound. ""Bouncing Babies,"" ""Shivering Shakespeare"" and ""Railroadin"" represent the liveliest shorts on this disc - certainly preferable to the slow-going ""Small Talk,"" ""Lazy Days"" and ""Bear Shooters."" From a historical standpoint, ""Boxing Gloves"" is a clumsy silent-sound hybrid that marks the film debut of Jackie Cooper. Happily, the Roach series managed to get its groove back during the 1930-31 season."
3,Not happy.,"Don't get me wrong I love all of the Rascals, but why but pictures of the ones that aren't on here? Deceiving. Other than that great."
5,Very good book for beginner,"This book is really old (1992) but is amazingly current on joinery techniques - at least for a beginner like me. I have not read the section on biscuit joints, but the secions on mitres, dados, dowels, rabbits, tongue and groove, and dovetails seem spot on with current tool and jig offerings. The pictures are old and black and white, but are effective. Very helpful in explaining the pros and cons of each, and exactly how to learn each of them."
3,Good But Too Technical,"Good production. This DVD addresses key teenage issues such as marijuana, alcohol and peer pressure. Though I really liked the fact that the DVD highlighted the ill effects of drugs and alcohol on the body, I felt the language used was too technical for pre-teens and younger teens. Nevertheless a good DVD."
4,"Gripping, descriptive, well written.",Excellant plot - talented author. Maya Bohnhoff's use of vivid descriptions brings both the characters and the historical setting alive for the reader. I encourage all those who enjoy science fiction - fantasy to get to know this authors works.
1,Corporate Attack Dogs Target Environmental Activists,"Driessen is obviously doing the bidding of corporate interests that want access to the world's markets without any accountability for environmental risks or concern for sustainability. The world does not need monoculture and genetically-engineered crops to eliminate hunger. It needs the political and moral will to share. Current food production is enough to feed a population 50% greater than the world's current population. Greedy corporations, dictators hoarding wealth, and international agencies that favor export crops over sustenance crops are to blame for hunger, not environmentalists. Don't let this mouthpiece for Monsanto and Dow fool you."
4,Nice Read,This was a very nice read with a good ending. Well done. Not too heavy. I would recommend it to others.
4,grest read!,Finally! An author who writes about the south and isn't politically correct. This was a great read with period correct phrases. Easily captured my attention. Mark childress did it again!
4,One m.i.s.s.i.s.s.i.p.p.i spells out a good read...,"One Mississippi is a delightful read! I tore through the book and did find it a great summer read. It is a coming of age story, but one in which you will find you wish you were right there with the main characters experiencing the same experiences. I do agree with another reviewer who states that there is somehow a feeling of unresolve at the end of reading this book, but there is satisfaction with some resolution in the relationships between characters such as the main character and his friend and with his father. Highly recommended."
3,Very weird,"In the beginning, it was very interesting, written pretty easy to read, and I wanted to know how the story ended so I kept reading. But weird weird weird. It just kept getting weirder. At first I was recommending this book to my coworker but by the end, I told her to take it off her list. Which characters are we suppose to like? The ending was just too much. Too much drama and darkness. And the creepy uncle was WEIRD. By the end I didn't care for any of the characters. I'm glad this was a library book."
3,"Something ""Miss""-ing","The book was highly touted on year-end lists for 2006, but I was highly disappointed in it. I felt the tone of the book (crazy things happen to this quirky family that help one of their sons grow up) was consistent at first, but by the end the reader is left wondering where all the fun went. It had lots of great moments - the prom night is especially fun - but overall, it lost its sense of itself about three quarters of the way in.I found the ending infuriating and a really obvious way to address one of the major conflicts. Perhaps there were too many big issues (racism, homophobia, family problems, adolescence, and even religion) for one novel.Chidress has a great sense of character and does some wonderful work with voice, but the development of the story on the whole does not live up to the sum of its parts."
4,A Stroll Down Memory Lane,"Baby boomers will enjoy this book! Tucked within an endearing story are many of our own teenage memories that are often forgotten over the years -- popular foods, songs, jargon, cool cars, the most popular girl in school, the class bully, how it felt to be 17... While darkly comical, the reader is left with the realization that things aren't that much different today than they were when we were teenagers."
3,"Funny, Yet Filled with Horror","I would love to be able to whole-heartedly recommend ""One Mississippi"", but I just can't. This book starts as a hilarious coming-of-age novel set in the 1970s and then it turns into some kind of horror story.The 16-year-old protagonist, Daniel Musgrove, is forced to move from Indiana to a town outside of Jackson, Mississippi, which is a situation ripe for some comedic culture shock.""One Mississippi"" covers some ground on race relations in addition to the usual challenges of moving to a new community and making your way through high school. And then it really gets ugly.""One Mississippi"" reminded me of the movie ""Meet the Parents."" Quite often funny things were happening, but then something horribly uncomfortable would happen to the protagonist and you would think it couldn't get any worse. And then, it did get worse and yet more uncomfortable.I loved and hated ""One Mississippi."""
4,One Mississippi: A Novel,I enjoyed the book and did not anticipate where it lead. The plot line was some what disapointing and the ending seemed to bow to convention. The sub plots had some good thoughts in them that were cleverly conveyed. I do think that it would not have been unthinkable for the ending to be different. The condition of the book was excellent and exceeded expectations. Delivery time was much faster than expected.
1,Amazon Did Great Job. Book Disappointing,"Received excellent service from Amazon. Unfortunately, I didn't realize from what I reviewed that this book by an author I had loved would be so disappointing. Be mindful as you read the synopsis to be sure it's what you want."
3,Funny? You thought this was funny?! (Partial spoiler inside),"According to the reviews all over the book jacket, this book ought to be a laugh riot. Stephen King says, ""Funniest novel I've read in 10 years!"" Seemingly, everyone else concurs - this is one funny book.Hmmm, let's take a look, shall we? We've got a hit-and-run accident, a brain injury, wanton destruction of property, bullying, pedophilia, suicide, parental abuse, racial tension, and a school schooting that results in 5 dead. Oh my god, they're right, that IS funny - how could I have missed that?I'll give it 3 stars because, despite the misrepresentation on the jacket and the highly unnecessary and disturbing school shooting, it is quite readable, and the main character and his love interest are very likeable.But I just want to know what Stephen King usually reads."
5,KIDS LOVE IT!,I PURCHASED THIS FOR MY TWO GREAT GRANDDAUGHTERS AND THEY LOVE IT. WOULD LOVE TO GET THE PET PALS 2 BUT SO FAR IT IS NOT OUT IN LEAPSTER FORMAT.
4,My 3 kids love it,All three of my kids have loved this game for Leapster. It is fairly easy to learn to use and they never seem to get tired of it! It doesn't work as well on our 1 older leapster. The pen action doesn't seem to be accurate enough for this game but it works great with our newer Leapster model.
3,A big hit with kids,"My older daughter seven, received Nintendogs at the same time and this has given her the same satisfaction at her own level Educationally, this one is a little lower on the scale, but the charm of this game overcomes that shortcoming. We bought this for our 5 year old this past Christmas with high hopes and the game met every one. She absolutely loves this cartridge and all of my kids have had fun earning their coins and taking care of the dogs."
5,The best and favorite game so far,"Out of 6 games this is my boys favorite game. They are 4 & 5 years old. I think it is a great game also. It teaches sooooooooooo many different things. The only down side, is how long it takes to give the puppy a bath. Seems like forever."
4,Plays for Hours,"We bought this for a road trip for my 5 year old. She was quiet for over an hour each way in the car. That is review enough, I say!"
2,pets and pals leapster game,This game is great for the beginning Leapster enthusiast but the faster your child learns the more rapidly this game is left on the shelf.
5,5 yr old loves it!,"My 5 yr old son just got his Leapster a few weeks ago but needed very little help from me to navigate this game. I can usually hear him in the other room giggling and saying ""Yes!"" when he is playing it. I would recommend it!"
4,My 5-yr old loves Pet Pals,"Gave our 5 yr old a pink Leapster for Xmas and Pet Pals and she LOVES it! She got a DS for her b-day last month from her uncle and I'm not quite that ready yet for her to get into a more advanced gaming system, so that's why we got her Leapster, in hopes of getting her an educational alternative to DS...she wasn't into the Leapster at first until she put in Pet Pals and now she is totally hooked. I also got her the Kindergarten software but she just wants to play with Pet Pals for now."
