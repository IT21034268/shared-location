1,no directions for mac setup,It took 4 phone calls to get this produce up and running. There are no instructions for mac setup online and the disc that comes with the router doesn't work on an imac. I would not recommend this product to anyone with a mac.
1,hate this product,"this product stopped working. i spoke to the customer rep and he said - ""oh, this doesn't work"" and without taking a breath tried to sell me a new product."
1,Dosen't work,Finally got to hook it up and it dosen't work. I already have the same one that I bought at Walmart years ago and it is still doing fine. Bought this one for my husband to use when he is at the apartment because his went out and this one dosen't work.
2,Not what I expected,"I bought this as an upgrade for my internet service. After several months of the interned dropping repeatedly since I got this, my cable company finally got tired of me calling and complaining and blaming them that they finally gave me a new one of theirs instead and now I have no problems."
5,Best wireless I've had so far,"I bought one of these after my D-Link DI-624 started to break down. I've always had issues with my d-link, and I wanted change. I did some research and decided to get the Linksys WRT54GL. I loaded in DD-WRT onto it and it's been working flawless ever since. After about two days of tweaking, i had my whole house covered with a wireless signal, something by D-Link was never able to do. The added customizablility with DD-WRT really made the difference. I've had zero problems with my wireless at home, even when using heavy traffic programs such as Bit Torrent, which would always make my D-link crash and reboot.I highly reccomed this product, it has served me extremely well."
4,Works well under tough conditions,"We are using this router to connect wirelessly to entrance gates at our club grounds. It gets a tremendous amount of use as we check in some 5000 campers, connect to our membership database and keep up with 6 remote laptops all out in the field. WORKS GREAT!"
5,It works. It's common. Its a proven design.,"My first one lasted 11 years through hundreds of Florida lightning storms. At about 9 years continuous service it developed a slight hiss that I ignored. Finally at 11 years or so it started losing the settings and going back to default every day, so I replaced it with the same type. I am not interested in this product. I want to set it up and forget it, and this fits the bill nicely. It serves eight wireless devices in a 3000 square foot home and its all the way at one end of the house."
1,these routers fail after only months,"I've owned three of these routers. The first worked for 5+ years and then failed. The second worked for 2 years and then failed. The third worked for only a few months before failing.It would seem Linksys' quality control has gone downhill. I've owned many Linksys networking devices over the years, and up until 2 years ago they were always reliable.At only $60 it's not worth the trouble to deal with tech support. The last time I tried I was on the phone for an hour and then had to mail back my old broken router. You might as well just buy a new one - one that's not made by Linksys."
4,Linksys 2011,"I ordered this router for an elderly friend to help her get set up around here home. Her cable company just ran a long cable across the floor to hook up to her computer across the room. I have a Linksys router myself and like it very much, which is why I ordered one for my friend."
3,Wireless Router,"Limited areas of reception in the house- unable to get reception outside of immediate vicinity of wireless device. Could not use downstairs, on the porch or outside on the deck."
5,Simple Installation,Bought this router a couple of months ago and it installed in about 5 minutes using the Wizard. Haven't had a bit of trouble with it and I am very pleased with the purchase. Would certainly buy again and highly recommend the product.
1,WRTG54g series no longer supported,"Do not buy. WRTG54g series is no longer supported. a great router in 2005, no longer supported by Cisco. I had my laptop reimaged, the router did not recognize the old WPA and resetting didn't work. Cisco offers no current online support for G series routers, just old FAQs. Their chat offered me $29.99 phone support. Do not waste your money."
1,labyrinth bureaucracy in place of warranty service,"Warning.... Linksys will require you to spend an hour on the phone if your unit fails and they will be VERY reluctant to issue an RMA number .... this is evidently a cost saving measure (they only earn about 75 cents an hour in India) . My WRT54G's firmware became corrupted after a power failure. I printed out some 13 pages from the Linksys website and spent more than an hour dutifully following the instructions. I was able to erase the old firmware, but the new firmware would not install...... .they have steadfastly refused to issue an RMA number....I don't pretend to be a technical expert at router repair....but I shouldn't need to be to have my router repaired under warranty...."
1,Late shipping,I paid for overnight shipping the package was not received overnight. I would like a return in shipping cost.
2,Signal drops all the time,this this is so bad i have to use an eathernet cable for my laptop because the signal drops SO much i think u should avoid this router and get wireless N it has better receprion and is faster (with wireless N compatable cards) but it also works with Wireless G and B. Spend more money to get a better linksys router or better yet get a netgear router they are awesome.
3,Apple Users Beware,"Now I am connected I am happy with the speed and performance. I called immediatelyon delivery Re Apple compatibility. I was assured and pressed on. However, the CDinstructions were in DOS - not compatible. It took two hours on the phone withLinksys Customer Service (in India?) to get manual configuration completed!! Onlywhen I assured them that I had Firefox were they able to get internet connectioncompleted. So MacBook users, take heed."
3,ok,"Works ok, but my previous router allowed me to block websites that I didn't want my children to look at. Other than that, I like this one. Easy to install."
1,Old Tech,I have an earlier version of this router that I bought about 12 or 13 years ago. My network was getting unreliable so I bought this new model so I could reuse the high gain antennas I bought for the old one. I used it for two weeks and realized that this router was no better than the older model. I took this router out and put in a cheap Belkin N router and saw 1000% improvement. The technoligy of this router is just plain out-dated. You can buy an affordable new tech router for the same price with much better performance.
1,Tech support flaming useless,"This is supposed to be a WIRELESS router, so why must I plug the computer into it? I called tech support, and it took five attempts just to keep their horrible antiquated menu system from disconnecting me, then I just got to speak to a moron. I am definitely returning it."
4,Good product but setup instructions did not work.,I have been using the product for a month and no problemswhatsoever: no interruptions in the wireless connection. Thesetup as followed in the CD did not work however and I had torely on my son who has the same product (and had recommended itto me) to get me connected via the Linksys web site.
4,Solid Reputation and Performer,"I buy Linksys because of its reliability, ease-of-use, and three-year warranty. I gave it a slightly lower rating because Linksys now only offers a one-year warranty.Regardless, it's my fourth - three currently working - and I've no complaints, especially since it gives me the option to ""upgrade"" using third-party vendor software. The OEM-provided software and upgrades are more than sufficient for my needs. I don't run any file-sharing nor am I an avid online gamer but we do have five wireless users who use the Internet for E-Mail, productivity, and online banking - sometimes, to VPN to work."
4,wireless router,Arrived quickly. Easy to set up - pictures accompanied each step. Used with Roku video box and both performed as expected.
2,Not worth it,I have used this router for over 2 years now and I bought after reading reviews at amazon. I am not very impressed. I have to restart the router multiple times every week. The signal strength is week & sometime it randomly loses signal for 10-15 mins.I will stay away from it.
2,Beware!,Have had two of these in last 3 years. First one went out and luckily I had registered with Linksys and still had a few days left to have it covered under warranty. Got it replaced and now two days ago that one (warranty replacement) went out which is now out of warranty. I will NOT be replacing it with another Linksys. Tech support was unable to tell me what the issue was with it.
5,"Great, used to extend my signal","I just used this to extend my signal to the basement and it was great, I had an Ethernet cable running all the way down there so I had an amazing signal. I have used it for about 4 years and it is still working. Great router, no problems at all in 4 years."
5,Pretty much perfect,"I have had this router for about three and a half months and it's pretty much perfect. It was incredibly easy to install and is very very fast. It's placed on the lower floor in the back left corner of a very well-insulated house. My bedroom is on the upper floor in the front right corner of the house, and I've never lost the signal. Actually, that's no true: in the first couple of weeks, I lost it 2-3 times and had to reset it (~1 min each time). That was also really easy and hasn't happened since. So maybe it's a 4.9/5. Whatever. It's still great!"
4,Works great once you change firmware,I ordered this just to run Tomato. One of the few firmware that actually does bandwidth tracking. So far so good.
2,Not very good as a extender/repeater,"I have been using this router for the past 2 years. It has performed very well with both my LAN desktops and wireless. I have hardly had to reset it twice. But this is not a good router when it comes to alternate configurations. The UI is so techie that you hardly understand any of the fields in the configuration webpage.I bought a new cisco 4500 app enabled router in order to extend my network in my new apartment(I have destops in different rooms and I dont want to run network cables across the house). I tried to configure WRT54GL as a network repeater and it was a nightmare doing so. I was asked to update my firmware adn when I did, it did not take it and I tried to do a reset(a more painful process of holding the reset button for a minute) and it did not recover at all. After that I could not even access the http page to configure it.I have finally discarded it and bought another cisco 4500 router in order to extend my network."
4,Cisco-Linksys WRT54GL Wireless-G Broadband Router,It had all the features I was looking for in a new router for my home and was not super expensive.
5,"Very good home router, wired and wireless.",This was my third purchase of this router over the years. One for me and two for friends and family members.This is a great product and I have recommended several times.
2,Didn't work,We had to return this router. Not sure if it was defective or what but not matter what we tried it would not connect to the computer.
5,As expected,I bought this router to create a wireless bridge for a home office with no hard wire capability. It's done the job with no issues. A solid product at a great price
1,"Awful support, bad firmware if you want security. Avoid!","WPA does not work out of the box. Installing third-party firmware doesn't fix the problem and also voids the warranty. Unless you want to go in circles with very narrowly trained tech support reps, avoid! You will be blamed for any malfunction."
1,No longer useful,"Don't believe the ratings. Nowadays this thing is too slow. It only has 802.11g which means your speeds are extrmely slow considering the very common 802.11n nowadays. Not to mention it needs to be reset often. The web UI is alright, but in the year 2012 this thing needs to be put to rest, it sucks."
1,Cisco no longer supports it,"It worked for a while until recent Windows upgrade caused the device to start having that duplicate name in network error and caused the wifi unusable, despite strong signals. I call Cisco to find it out of date and no longer supported. Surprised Amazon still carries it."
3,Set Up CD NOT compatible w/ Mac OS,"FYI this product has a set up CD that cannot be run on a Mac OS. The idea of manually setting up a product sounds painful to a non-tech savvy person such as myself. I am sure they have great customer support which seems to be a highlight of linksys, but by the time I found the website, logged into their live chat, and told them my model number, serial number, and my issue, and waited for them to see if I am covered for their support, I've used up 34 minutes. I was told that manually setting it up would require me to call in bc I would lose internet and an additional 20 minutes of set up time. That is too long when there are other wireless products w/ a wizard that runs. That is 34 minutes of my life that I cannot get back, and 20 additional minutes I do not want to waste, and then if I ever move, and have to reset up / install, or if I get a new computer, I will forget how to manually install this product. Conclusion: I am returning the product."
1,Wireless Router,This router was a replacement for a D-Link router that lasted for over 2 years. The only reason I got a new one was because the wireless feature needed rebooting every time I connected to it. Linksys router functionally failed completely after only 30 days. I thought I had learned my lesson about Linksys (Cisco) years ago. Replaced it with another D-link router from Fry's. 2 years is a resonable time period but 30 days is ridiculous. Fortunately Amazon allowed me to return it and refunded my money.
4,A great building block,"This is a great router to use if you are building a home network with multiple routers. I use two of these, flashed with dd-wrt, to provide wireless coverage to my entire house. This router provides a very stable environment, but may not have enough oomph for gamers. The stability and pliability of this router is the main reason I use them."
1,Terrible Router. Needs Constant Resetting.,"I read the reviews about the constant resetting, and I figured ""as long as I have a solid connection to my modem, and I keep my firmware up to date, this won't be a problem for me"" WRONG! This router constantly needs resetting, its become a twice a day type thing and its getting worse. I strongly recommend that you do not buy this item."
2,Should be simple to install wasn't,I still have not been able to get this product to work and have been unable to reach a live person for help after a month.
5,Great router,"I have been using it for couple of months with DD-WRT firmware and love it. It has been rock solid without any issue.If you are looking at this product, that means you are looking to run custom firmware to expose more functionalities. If that is the case, look no farther. This little box with DD-WRT can provide pretty much all the advanced functionalities you would need."
4,Linksys wireless router,This is the second one I've purchased. I have had no problems with the first and expect the same for the second.
4,Not sure what to think...,I had never set up a wireless internet connection. Set it up and everything seemed ok. Connection stopped working within 24 hours. Called Linksys and they made me pay $9.99 just to have them walk me through it and when it did not work they remotely accessed my computer. Had to call back and they walked me through it this time or were going to charge me another $9.99. Product seemed ok but they are bleeding people dry with their customer service.
4,Linksys Wireless Router,When setting up your router make sure that you rename the system and add a simple password. Setting it up with a wireless laptop took a little effort. I was not please with the fact that when you call in for help they make an effort to have you connect to their system through the internet to resolve the issue for a FEE rather than just talking you though the problem for free.
1,Short lifetime,Though this products work well it has a very short lifetime. My WRT54GL stopped working after 3 years and I just had a linksys wireless-G range expander stop working after 3 years as well. It looks like they design these things with a limited lifetime.
5,Great,"I really can't add anymore that other reviewers haven't already said countless times in the past.This one's a classic, maybe it doesn't have the latest and greatest technology anymore, but still amazing."
3,Mahler Lover,"I highly respect Bernstein and his conducting. His recording of Mahler One is my favorite, and several of his Shostakovich Symphonies (his 5th in particular) are genuine works of art. When it comes to this recording of Mahler Two, I felt that is was big let-down. The end, which is one of the most powerful outpouring of emotions I have ever come across in music, was taken awfully slow. It was overdramatic, and lost my interest because of the tempo. The soloists didn't do to much to blend with each other either. Often they overpowered the orchestra, and the string section was lost. The full choir, though the most beautiful I have heard on a recording of Mahler Two as of yet, was overpowered by the orchestra. I would suggest listening to other recordings, such as Zubin Mehta and the Vienna Philharmonic. If you listen to this recording first, however, the magic will not lost. It is my opinion that other conductors shaped the music better than Bernstein did."
5,Mahler Rocks,"Though as Amazon points out, the tempi here are a bit slower than usual (the performance is about 90 minutes long, requiring 2 CDs), the tempo never seems sluggish.I just love Bernstein's Mahler interpretations - and this is the only performance of the 2ND, in which I really felt like I understood what the symphony is really about. The fact that it was recorded in the 90's with luscious digital sound is also very nice - I'll take an excellently played modern performance over an analog ""historic"" recording any day!"
3,Resurrect the CBS Recording,"I discovered Gustav Mahler through Leonard Bernstein's CBS recordings of the 1960s. I remember being thrilled the first time I heard the Second Symphony and it remains one of my favorite pieces of music. Too bad this more recent recording does not live up to that experience. Although the sonics are far superior to the earlier CBS recording, Bernstein's pace is very very slow and can be considered self-indulgent. Clocking in at almost 94 minutes, this is probably the longest recording of this work. This ponderous pace is especially apparent in the last two movements. In every other recording I have heard of this work, the finale depicting Judgment Day has some of the most exciting music in the repertoire. However, in this performance Bernstein has made the music almost boring. I kept on wanting him to move on and could not really enjoy Mahler's triumphant music. My best advice is to resurrect Bernstein's 1963 recording with Janet Baker and enjoy."
3,Heaven-storming kitsch,"Leonard Bernstein made three commercial recordings of the ""Resurrection"" Symphony, and each time he returned to the symphony it got slower and more exaggerated. Otto Klemperer, not exactly a speed demon in his later years, managed to play through in 79 minutes what Bernstein required 94 to traverse in this set. Everything in this recording is overdone and loved to death, and while Bernstein's total identification with Mahler can't help but pay some dividends, I really feel as though this composer doesn't need quite as much ""help"" in making his points as the conductor evidently believes. It devolves into kitsch, even if it's kitsch of a high order. Never boring (was Bernstein ever?) but not as true to the letter and spirit of this heaven-storming score as Klemperer, Mehta in his Vienna recording, the businessman-turned-amateur-conductor Gilbert Kaplan--or Bernstein himself in his (still kinda overstated) 1963 recording with the same orchestra."
5,Gorgeous Mahler Second,"For sumptuous orchestral and vocal sound, and for stretching of the limits of good taste in expressing every last ounce of emotion in the score, this is a wonderful recording. The final 25 minutes, in particular, are stunning, and, if you like Mahler done this way, totally exhausting. There could hardly be a greater contrast in versions than that between this recording and Bernstein's recently released 1960s recording with the N. Y. Philharmonic (Sony), which is lean and taut and almost driven. This version is magnificent on every dimension, including the recorded sound."
2,Overblown.,"The fact is that the Mahler second is quite classical in form despite its hyper-romantic content. Bernstein ignores this, so you should ignore him this time. (I'm not a Bernstein hater. I think his Mahler 6 & 9 are tops.) The best second I've heard is Stokowski on RCA. Klemperer is very good too. I probably should reconsider the classical Walter records when I get a chance."
3,Flawed,"The strings on this recording are barely audible, even the woodwinds overpower them. Although everthing else sounds great I suggest trying other recordings."
4,Country Mouse & the City Mouse Adventures,"My 2.5yr old love these ""mouse cartoons"", he probably doesn't understand half of what's going on, but he still love to watch them over and over again. The cartoon drawings are very simple, but the stories are interesting.I'm not really sure what it is he likes so much about them, one thing he does get excited over is the cats chasing the mice, there's plenty of that going on.Even if I'm not too crazy about these cartoons (they're a little bit silly), I am glad my son likes them because they're pretty wholesome imo.We have 2 more of these ""Country mouse..."" DVD's, the other two had a ""play all"" button which is missing in my copy of this DVD, too bad because I think this one is the best of the three."
4,Nice recording,"nice job, Carreras is not my first choice, but he does a nice job. The Sopranos are quite good."
2,Warning - this is a push mower - not self propelled,"It's not evident in the description, but this mower is not a self-propelled mower. I had no idea that mowers were still produced that sent no power to the wheels. We had a self-propelled mower 20 years ago. Crazy that it is not a standard feature. Beyond that, the mower is nice. I guess you get what you pay for. Now I know why the model was so cheap compared to the other Lawn Boy models. Also, there are no speed controls or any significant features to this mower. It's the definition of simple. Basically it's either on or off - and that's it. No choke or acceleration or adjustments. That could be good or bad, depending on your preferences. If you're looking for a mower that is a snap to setup and has no frills - and you want a bit more exercise from the pushing - this is the model for you. Otherwise, steer clear."
5,Satisfied Lawn Boy/Amazon Customer,"I own the Lawn-Boy model# 10363. The difference being my mower is self propelled. The mower was shipped UPS to my door step in perfect condition. I unfolded the handle, and added the included oil, and I was ready to cut some grass.Someone mentioned in their review they bought this mower because it's a 2 stroke motor? It's powered by a 4 stroke Tecumseh engine. I have owned the mower 2 years. I never changed the oil, serviced the spark plug, or even cleaned /replaced the air filter, and it starts on the first pull, and runs like clockwork. The only servicing I have performed is sharpening of the blade. During season I mow my dense Floratam lawn on every third day, and once a week in the winter. My mower doesnt get a break. It is in service 12 months a year. I have had zero issues with my Lawn-Boy mower."
5,The Other Side of Dyslexia,"This is an interesting account of an actual dyslexic person who had put lots of thought into overcoming dyslexia. It's fun, simple and an easy read."
5,one of the best new age composers of our day,I want music that is insperational and uplifting. Tim Janis uses the best of electronic and symphonic instruments to create a blend of music that is both soothing and haunting.
4,Are you thinking know all about werebeasts?,"Thirteen lycanthropes-cursed with changing forms and the madness of bloodlust-are featured with histories, roleplaying strategies, and adventures created specifically for them. All play well both as stand-alone adventures and as parts of larger campaigns."
1,undrinkable!,"Agh, I don't know how anyone could get this down! I still feel like I'm going to be sick just thinking about what it was like to try to drink it. I bought it for a cleanse, no thank you! I guess I'll stay uncleansed if this is a requirement!"
2,"Works, but tastes aweful, did not use for longest time","It just sat there on the shelf for the longest time because I was loathe/reluctant to drink it. I don't even like pulp in my orange juice. My dad says it tastes like cardboard. It does work, but makes you bloated. Prefer the pill forms (calcium polycarbophil) and chewable flavored tablets (inulin). Also, the Benefiber (wheat dextrin) colorless/tasteless powder is better too, as it has no grit and tastes ever so slightly like cotton candy. Would not buy again.BTW I believe the way soluble fiber reduces cholesterol is by binding with bile from the gall bladder (absorbing it) and drawing it out of your system. Bile is created with cholesterol from your system."
4,"Works well, does not mix well.","This product certainly works well and is a good and simple source of fiber. It doesn't mix well, but the packaging doesn't claim that it dissolves, so there's not misrepresentation.I typically mix it with whey protein powder in a shaker bottle and it's almost unnoticeable. It is flavorless and odorless.I gave it 4 stars because it does not mix well in a glass with water, orange juice, etc. It just sits on top of the liquid in clumps, even if I stir it for 2-3 minutes. The only way to get it to mix into something is with a shaker bottle.It certainly works, however, in regard to making you more regular and keeping you that way!"
4,Good price,The price was right and the delivery was quick. I have been taking only one teaspoon daily with cereal so far and it's somewhat helping.
2,B-O-R-I-N-G,"This book may be the story of Willie Dixon's music, but it's certainly not Willie's story. I kept waiting to find out more about Willie, the man, but my questions were never answered."
2,USB charger doesn't work.,"I'm soooo dissapointed. I thought i had found a good charger for my mp3 player, but as soon as i started charging it, I realized the USB charger actually doesn't work :(I'm going to see how I can return this."
1,Do not buy this product!,"I purchased this product based on rave reviews on Amazon and other sites. It broke two days into a two week tour of Italy. I managed to find a remote shop during vacation to purchase additional fuses, to no avail. This product is terrible and I am tremendously annoyed because the return window has passed. Terrible product!"
1,"a little better quality, please","I purchased this thinking I could toss all my old adapter plugs, which I did. I took it on a month long trip and it died the second day and I was without. I am not sure why such a simple device should be so shoddy."
3,"First One Died, Buying Another","I have a love/hate relationship with this adapter.When it worked, I loved it, as I could charge my iPhone (first original, then 3G) with just this device and a cable. I got in the habit of leaving it in my travel bag, and have used it successfully in the US, EU, Russia, and northern Africa. It packs in one relatively small and smooth piece which stuffs nicely into a folded pair of socks, so you don't have a bag full of prongs waiting to put holes in things.The hate part comes from it breaking on me while overseas and one month out of warranty, leaving me to find an available computer with a USB port to recharge my phone.I'm buying another one because this thing was just so great while it worked, and I haven't seen anything else that comes close to being as nice to travel with and use. If you tend to be hard on your toys though, you might want to look elsewhere."
2,USB charger a bust,The USB charger does not charge a Creative Micro Zen MP3 player. The player just drains to zip when it is plugged in.
1,HORRIBLE!,I went to Europe and bought this item before I left. It didn't work on any electrical applicance that we brought. I was stuck in Europe with NOTHING. I DO NOT recommend this item. Worthless.
2,USB Charger doesn't actually charge my devices,"I've tried two of these travel chargers. It's a nice idea. I have some devices that can be trickle-charged by USB, so for my trip overseas I wanted to just bring one of these adapters and the device's USB cables to save space. But the USB adapter caps did not charge my cell phone (Motorola L6) or PDA (Palm TX), so I'll still have to bring the full wall adapters.If the AC adapter cap converted voltage, it would be great, but it doesn't.If you could plug the AC adapter cap onto one end, and the USB adapter cap on the other, you could have a nice compact one-piece unit for travel. Of course if the USB adapter cap doesn't work, what's the point?It's still useful for its travel adapter cpabilities, but I am disappointed that it wouldn't charge any of my USB devices."
1,does NOT WORK with 3 prong laptop adapters,"Thing seems nicely made, clever design. However, you CANNOT plug in laptops with a ground pin sticking out, it won't fit. Sigh. back it goes...."
4,A Must-Have for Travel,"I've been using this for over one year, and have been very happy with the performance. I use it to charge my iPod and electric shaver (not at the same time, of course), and it has fit fine in every outlet that I've tried.The description says this is an ""all-in-one"" adapter, which is a bit of a stretch. There is the main adapter body, and two removable caps, one for regular electronic devices, and one for USB devices. You can only use one of the caps at a time, so there will be a loose cap around. It would be nice if it came with a little bag or case to keep the components together.Please note that this DOES NOT CONVERT VOLTAGE, nor does it make any claims that it does so. Read the instructions and carefully check your electronics before leaving for your trip."
2,Not what I expected,"The USB adapter worked great, but the way it is described is that it is a plug adapter and it is not. It adapts to various plug types, but you can only plug in a USB device and not a standard US plug device."
2,Not all it's cracked up to be,I was under the impression that this was an AC/DC power converter. Do not be fooled!
3,Rouse The Demon Review,"This story takes place in the 70's in Santa Monica, Ca. It was an interesting read to follow the lingo and the technology of the time. The story is well written and entertaining."
3,Okay Inorganic Textbook,This is an okay inorganic book. Does not describe details well. Bad book for a beginner.
5,One of the best introductory inorganic textbooks around,"I bought this book on the recommendation of one of my chemistry advisors. I must say, it is one of the best books available on the market for inorganic chemistry. The chapters on bonding, solid state, and coordination are very well done, but the authors have done a good job on the rest as well. They don't try to gloss over anything and provide references for further reading. I used this book as background for an inorganic synthesis project; I am using it for a one-semester inorganic class now (the book was designed for a two-semester class), and I will use it again when I take a higher class in inorganic chemistry."
4,A Pretty Thorough Book,"There are not alot of I-CHEM textbooks out there in the first place, and finding a decent one is even harder. This one, however, ranks among the decent ones. While it's not brand new, the concepts and explanations are applicable to the latest college I-CHEM class. I bought this book as an inexpensive supplement to my other I-CHEM textbook from Housecroft. This book helps to reinforce and explain some of concepts you might get in a book like Housecroft's in a little more depth.I will say, for those of you who might feel this is important, is that this textbook isn't full of color illustrations and graphs. It's all black and white graphs and print. To most this won't matter, but to some it makes the book too boring to read - so I thought I'd put that info in my review."
2,Not terrible,"It covers the material comprehensively, but like most advanced chemistry books it is written for people who already know the information. I would not recommend this book."
3,it's an ok book,"this book is entirely black white. it is visually unstimulating and it makes staying awake while studying quite difficult. yet, it does do a good job of explaining things. ofcourse it didn't quite help my grade b/c i had a horrible proff. But i sure hope you have better luck than i did! happy studying!"
5,a excellent book,"schlessinger tells us very exactly how was jfk, and his administration. it's very exciting, but it's sometimes boring.it's the most complete book of jfk's administration.I recommend it to everybody.but there aren't any photos."
5,127 Authentic Art Deco Designs,"This book represents early Art Deco Designs, perhaps even late Art Nouveau Designs. The strikingly remarkable feature is the color combinations, which show the early flavor of the period. These designs were taken from two portfolios of 1920's artists.There is a full range of figures from antalope and mountian lion to flowers and people. Some of which are highly intricate and ornate, while others verge on the primative. As a source book for a decorative artist (me), it gives subject and theme for any period compositions which can be mounted.The art is highly styled and ornate, giving a fresh look to the Art Deco Period."
3,ummm....it was okay. herione really bothered me,"I really like Gena Showalter's paranormal books, and thought this one would show the same originality. I thought that the book was okay, but was not really impressed. The herione Naomi was a pain in my [...]. I was so tired of hearing her complain about not wanting to take a chance in love due to her divorce. I guess I have known to many people in her position, and her whole personality just seemed fake and put on. I was really bummed. The hero I loved. He was great...too bad he was paired with such a dud."
2,Don't Bother.....,"This one had some promising aspects. I was laughing out loud during this first part of this book, but then all of a sudden it just became to ""over the top"" and unrealistic for me to even be able to suspend belief for a moment...which is funny because this a romance novel!Here's what I disliked:1. I don't prefer to read books written in the first person. These kind of books usually leave out to much of what others are thinking. This book is a perfect example of just that.2. I don't like books where there is no good reason for the couple to be together. This book hopes to get the reader to buy into the idea that is was love (or lust) at first sight for him. I never believed that a rich and classy guy would act and behave like he does.3. She bugged me.....all the tigress stuff irritated me and I couldn't figure out for the life of me what in the world was wrong with these people.Stick with her paranormal stuff.....The Darkest series is very good."
4,Exciting Read!,It's always nice to read a first person point of view romance since I have found that they are rare. And for them to be enjoyable and sometimes funny is even more rare to me. Gena Showalter is really a writer that causes me to read like crazy! I just can't seem to get enough. I read this book in about 3 days. This is a keeper.
4,Animal Instincts,"Naomi is a party planner that is trying to heal from a messy divorce from Richard who cheated on her. She receives the ""Unleashing the Tigress Within"" self-help book from her cousins, and starts to work on unleashing hers. In steps Royce, a rich, to die for good-looking guy that saw her and fell in love at a function she planned 6 months earlier. Royce tries to call her but Naomi won't take his calls because she's sworn off men. So he has his mother hire her to plan her surprise birthday party. It's hilarious to watch Naomi flit back and forth as she learns that not every man is like her ex-husband...and that Royce is really playing for keeps.I love the way Gena puts herself into her writing...it shows. Shes on my auto-buy list to stay!"
4,Very Funny,"This is one of the first books I read by this author, and there were times I was crying I laughed so hard. It was very light and read fast. I would definitely recommend to others."
3,Animals are sleeping,"I'm a huge Gena Showalter fan. I have read all of her books and look forward to each one. This book fell a little flat for me. Her normal flair was lacking. If anyone else had written this book, I probably would have rated it 4 stars, but I expected more from her book. That probably isn't fair as others may like it."
4,excellent,"Don't be scared by the cover. This looks like a Vertigo Era Black Sabbath Cover. But Daddy Longlegs is a whole different storyDaddy was on Vertigo too, but this is fantastic straight rock, much of it banged out on the piano. This guy never did much commercially, but if you like straight early 70s rock, this will go many miles."
4,NO ENGLISH LIBRETTO???,"Why, then that's a wonderful chance for you to learn italian. Excellent (and very personal) reading by Giulini, excellent cast too, only lacking the extra vocal sumptuousness in the cases of Domingo, Plowright and Fassbaender. That takes one star away for me."
3,Giulini's (DG)? Or Levine's (Sony)?,"I'm trying to decide between Giulini's (DG) version of this opera, and Levine's (Sony). I already have Humburg's (Naxos) version, which is pretty good for a budget set. Problem is, the libretto -- like all librettos released by Naxos -- has no english translation. And if the DG set doesn't have an english translation either, as one of the reviewers here says, then I will definitely go with the Sony set. But I can't believe DG would release a full-priced opera without an english libretto! Otherwise, I tend to prefer DG's opera sets better than any other label. (With London's and Teldec's coming in a close second.)"
3,"Interesting, but some limitations","Although ostensibly about battles, this book is better read as a snapshot-style history of major wars. The extensive sections on the background and results of the battles provide pretty good accounts of a lot of military campaigns. But Davis's summaries of the actual battles are generally too brief to be informative and the illustrations are poor. In addition, buyers should be aware that the book is primarily a history of Western battles, with a smaller number of battles from other areas added in. Finally, although Davis's writing style is fluid and generally engaging, the book contains a surprising number of grammatical errors that perfectionists may find distracting."
3,"Good context, but little description of battles","This is book does a good job introducing significant battles in their contexts as well as depicting the effects they had on worked history. This is a great book to read to just get an overview of history and some knowledge of military history. In describing 100 battles, the author was restricted on the space for each individual account. He often makes references to places and towns whose location a casual reader would be hard pressed to find. The lack of quantity and quality of maps is also disappointing. The descriptions of the battles themselves were a little disappoint as well. Over all this is a pretty good account, I would give it 3.5 if I could. The book's strength lies in the context and consequences of the battle, and not the accounts of the battles themselves. It does get a little boring at times, but I still recommend it."
2,Over-rated ..,"The author is a journalist and is just writing bits and pieces about financial advisors she has encountered in her career. Half way through the book I decided to stop reading as I was just started to skim to see if I have missed anything... If you are a top Advisor (read .. hundreds of millions in assets or more..) and wondering what the market niche of other top Advisors is, this may be good. If you are starting out look elsewhere .. The text lacks flow to make the book an enjoyable read. Add to this the superficial content and there you go .."
3,Good journalistic piece where Rich Salzer gets a mention!,The journalist author does a good andcomplete job on the subject matter. Ihighly recommend it! - R.A.S.
5,Powerful,"I was lucky enough to see this film on the last day of the 2011 Sundance Festival. I finally had a day off from my volunteer duties and I picked the closest theater and the film that started next. Thank the gods it was Kinyarwanda. Not only was this movie a powerful film that left me speechless, but it was a film about one of the least talked about genocides in history that ended on a hopeful note. Hopeful!I walked out of the theater unable to talk, trying not to cry. I shook the producers hand, unable to say anything to him and he just nodded in understanding.Before that and to date I have never seen a film that left me feeling like that.This film made my Sundance experience and if you are considering the purchase of this dvd/blue ray, do so. If you don't, you will be missing out on a profound film experience."
5,"Beautiful, moving experience, don't miss!","Kinyarwanda is a beautiful, uplifting experience. The film does not show the violence of the massacre. Instead, the director, Alrick Brown, weaves stories of kindness, forgiveness, love and faith in people to take care of each other. Be sure to see this film. You will recommend it to others. Because there is no violence, it is a wonderful film for young people to see."
5,Powerful and Informative,I learned so much about the struggle in this country that has not been publicized. The media would have you believe that these people started fighting for no apparent reason like savages. Absolutely not true. Once again Europeans are the distant yet observant and profiting catalyst.
1,Awful!,"Coming from the former USSR, I was curious to see this movie, but I have to say that I was quite dissapointed. It was easily one of the worst movies I have ever seen! Cheap looking sets, characters one does not care about, annoing music behind the camera, lack of plot... It's as if the movie was trying to determine my tolerance level. The quility of this DVD seems to match the quality of the movie. There is not even a scene selection available! Don't waste your time and find something better to do!"
4,fun book,"A fun book. A good idea to have a player rank other players. Too many errors, though. Misspells Boo Ferriss name, and some others. Some facts are wrong, too. The book says Pesky held the ball so one wonders did he really write it? And why is there a picture of Mickey Mantle swinging at a ball inside both the front and back covers? Is that a publisher's joke to anger Red Sox fans?It's still fun, though."
3,MMbop,"i think that this song is very old. it has lost all of its good qualities ,not that it ever was all that good."
4,great stories!,"The stories within the book help to put into contrast the seemingly ""important"" things in life and to see the actual importance of life itself."
2,Review,"Book arrived in good condition, but took justover a month to get to me, which I personallyfind a bit slow. I would still use this companyagain though. Thanks"
5,The greatest learning tool for working with mantras,This is a good learning tool for understanding and applying the mantra concept. It gives good background details if you want to gain knowledge on dealing with mantras.
5,Great Spiritual Practice,"I love chanting mantras, and Ashley-Farrand's books are easy to follow, contain pronunciation guides (very helpful!) and give chants for helping you with all manner of troubles.I've been doing the Ganesha one for months, and it's really helped!"
2,TYPICAL BLAXPLOTATION FILM,"I ACTUALLY PURCHASED THIS FOR A FRIEND WHO HARBORS THESE TYPE OF 70s MOVIES! I FOUND THIS TO BE A TYPICAL BLAXPLOTATION FILM FEATURING BLACKS IN THE ROLES OF GANGSTERS WHO ARE ENGAGED IN THE FAST LIFE WHICH NETS THEM DEATH OR LONG PRISON SENTENCES! THE ACTING WAS NOT UP TO PAR WITH TODAY'S CRIME ACTION FLICKS. IF YOU ARE NOT IN TO THESE TYPE OF STEREOTYPICAL FILMS, SAVE YOUR MONEY!"
4,For Sandy West - this album rocks!,"My friend in the 70s, David Coston, had this album on Japanese import and I borrowed it all the time. It sounded so much bigger than the studio albums. I'm finally getting my own copy today, in loving memory of Sandy West, one of the great all-time rock drummers!"
3,not as bad as expected,"I saw this movie two days ago,i was expecting something worst,but is not as bad as i thought.Emily longstreth was great and is the only movie where she had a leading role,i wonder why she retired so early i realy wanted to see a lot more of her.She had a leading role in american drive inn but this is much better,this movie should be on dvd.Emily if you see this said something,your fans want to know abaut you."
3,Not at all tuned to the application,"While these are certainly functional struts, they are far, far too stiff for this application (early B3 Passat). The car has become unbearably harsh and jittery; I would love to return to using my original (21 year old) struts, but unfortunately, they came apart upon dissasembly. Anyone care to comment on suitable alternatives: Boge, Bilstein, etc....?"
5,Nehemiah,This is an excellent resource to be used in conjunction with the Bible. I used this during a recent Bible Study I taught and it provided great information and details as well as practical life application. I would recommend this book for use by anyone seeking a greater depth of knowledge of Nehemiah.
4,Simply Excellent,"I am a fan of the ""Idiot"" books. But this provides a whole lot more than just an overview. It touches on the many facets of Simplicity and provides tactical, tangible actions."
2,Not for the young hands,"I bought this for my 4 year old son. We were both disapointed when he tried getting the blades to come out of the glove because it has a piece of plastic that his fingers are supposed to grip that slides on another plastic bar. When the hand is pushed down, the blades are supposed to come out and then back up to get them to go back into the glove. It would be a good gift for a much older child because the plastic that he holds onto slides with the movement of the hand, but in his case didnt give him enough leverage to push it all the way down since his arm is so short. To try to fix the sliding handgrip, I had to put tape on the plastic bar to keep the hand grip from sliding down to his wrist, it helped just a little, he still has to use both hands to get the blades to come out. Save your self the frustration of a whiney child."
3,DONT BUY THIS 1ST (2002) EDITION! THERE IS A 2ND (2007) EDITION!,"I didn't want to influence the overall rating of the book, so I gave it 3 stars. Can't give 2 1/2.THIS IS THE 1ST EDITION PUBLISHED IN 2002!!!!!! THERE IS A NEW VERSION (PUBLISHED DECEMBER 2007) AVAILABLE!!!I have notified Amazon of this and I am sure they will address it as soon as they can. However, I didn't want someone else to buy it and receive a different edition than what they expected. If you do want the 1st edition then go ahead and order away. But, if you want the 2nd edition, Amazon does sell it also.Same title, Same authors, Same publisher, Different edition[...]"
2,Frustrating...,"...in a bad way. ""The River"" (or ""Joki"") takes a painfully familiar formula (ex. Robert Altman's ""Short Cuts,"" as if we needed another), sets it in Finland, and leaves its viewer stranded. The film is structured around a woman who appears to be attempting suicide by drowning her and her baby in a river; the side-stories follow from there. Unfortunately, the ""we're-all-connected"" theme of the film feels less genuine than even the the most uninspired of the subgenre. The film feels more like a bunch of half-assembled ideas patched together solely because the director didn't know how to conclude (or leave interestingly inconclusive) each story. The sad part is that the film is far from dull; yet your endurance through the entirity may seem futile by the end-credits."
1,This Size Will NOT Cover King Size Bed,"I didn't buy this product, but I bought something similar in the store, with this size, and it didn't cover my regular king size bed"
4,OK - wish they had the original box,Work great with our HEPA filters. I like when they come in their original box so we can reorder the correct size. These filters just came in a clear bag so it is like someone bought a large box and just sold us some of theirs.
4,works like the original,Just wish they were a little bit less expensive. I have to change mine out every 30 days or so due to pet dander.
3,Filter,I paid more for the filter then I did the unit. Don't really know if it was worth it till I see what it does.
4,"Speedy delivery, correct product, lacked instructions","There are no instructions included with the product. As I acquired the unit second hand, I was unsure which way the filter went in. From the hunterair.com site: When you replace the filter in the unit, the white filter material should be facing outward (towards you) and the black carbon material should be hidden from view (inside the unit)."
5,Hunter makes good product,We are using these filters in our kitchen specially for cooking time.The filter works really good with our Hunter air purifier. Thank you.
3,Filter was a tight squeeze,The filter appeared to be similar to the original that came with the filter but for some reason did not fit properly. I had to force it to fit and manipulate it with some scissors. Hopefully it will work out.
1,Filter,Had to cut to fit despite showing it was the correct replacement filter for another filter number no longer made
3,Not as pretty as the burgundy or biege,"Just received this set in the mail this week from Amazon (which I will be giving as a gift!). I strongly suggest the other colors that are availible from The Grand, as this one seems very washed out. The quality of the set is worth a couple hundred dollars, so if you paid $150 for it you will not be disappointed. The comforter is very thick and will keep a bed warm. It even comes with 3 throw pillows for decoration. The website states that this is a 7 piece set, but it is actually 8 pieces. The fitted sheet fits my pillowtop mattress set, so it should be big enough for any queen size mattress. Another bonus: the comforter is machine washable, however it is really puffy, so it may not fit in the smaller more compact washers. This is a good alternative for bedrooms that are very neutral in color. The picture on Amazon is too colorful as it is even paler in person."
1,Fatuous narcisism,"Self-serving, ridiculous, shallow, delusional. I especially like the section in which he suffers a moment of self-doubt about abandoning his children to spend some quality time grooving on the west coast, but then instantly recovers with a fulsome and congratulatory rationalization. Maybe he'll give them a call! What a twit. Where's the INS?"
4,Age does make a diference,"This adventure really shows the pc's the meaning of staying young. It has everything a great adventure needs, a temple who needs help, an evil witch, and lots of monsters. The only setback is the location of adventure, which takes place in a huge swamp.....who would build a temple there....Great plot though."
3,I should have read the reviews first!,"I realized the mistake when I started playing them and got what was basically the PBS broadcast, right down with sales pitch to buy the DVD set! If I only read the reviews first..I'm waiting on some DVDs purchased from Amazon UK. If I can view them on my computer I'll buy all my future British series from the source. Less expensive as well."
3,Good stories -no subtitles,I enjoy these DVD's. I am disappointed that the Closed captioning does not work in our TV. It works for cable and other DVD's but does not work for Inspector Lewis.
5,One of the great detective duos,"The Inspector Lewis series is a worthy heir to the tradition of Colin Dexter's Endeavour Morse. The writing remains sharp, and the Oxford-area scenery brilliant. This package constitutes a fine introduction to the characters and continuing storylines that will continue through the full series."
5,I think it's good enough!,"Katia Ricciarelli may not be a great Turandot; Domingo may not be the best Calaf ever. Well, I love this recording anyway! Karajan's sound is powerful, showing that ""Herbie"" (when he really wants to) can be great, not just different from the others. Raimondi is superb, and Hornik is the Ping of my dreams! This recording is musical rather than lyrical, and with such a wonderful music, that's just the best way to play it!"
4,A poetic rendering of Puccini's most sophisticated opera.,"This recording has a restraint and sensitivity that most recordings of Italian opera lack. It is a precious, poetic rendering; lacking in the bombast that Italian opera can fall towards. The singers, whose performances are qualified by some of the other reviews, I find delightful. This performance has the intellectual strength and character that Von Karajan is known for. I have this on LP as well as CD. It you enjoy refinement this is the one for you. Forget the Zubin Mehta Sutherland Pavarotti recording; I am trying to auction it on this site!"
2,A disappointing recording,"I was very disappointed in this recording. Karajan's conducting is fine, but the roles of Turandot and Calaf are grossly miscast. Ricciarelli is out of her league in this role, as it is far too heavy for her (and it shows) and Domingo's straining on some of the high notes (""Nessun Dorma"" and High C at the end of Turandot's aria)is uncomfortable to lsten to. I recommend the Bjoerling/Nilsson recording on BMG or the Pavarotti/Sutherland recording on London for the more acceptable performance (these two are near perfection). What a shame."
4,THE STRAUSSIAN SOUND IN A PUCCINI'S OPERA,"It's known for everybody that Puccini used the wagnerian and straussian orchestration in his operas. This one is a great example of that herecy and Karajan really knows how to get that powerfull, brilliant and modern sounds from the Vienna Philharmonniker.I prefer the voice of Domingo but the technic of Corelli, whose Calaf is unbeateable. Of course, ""Nessun Dorma"" is better with the voice of Pavarotti, but Domingo's and Corelli's interpretation of the full score are the best in the history of contemporary recording."
3,Ark of the Covenant,I thought that this was a book. Acrually it waws a VHS tape. I will have to convert it to a DVD for the purpose intended for use.
5,VERY INTERESTING in TODAY'S Politics!,I saw this film when it was released and have aquired it recently. It is amazing to look at with all the current events that are taking place in the Middle east. This is a 3000 year stuggle in this region folks and topics cover in this film ARE relevant today!
2,Huh...?,I also cannot figure out the high praise for this book. It was dreadfully boring & the ending was a huge letdown. Not one truly interesting character in the entire book.
2,"Shallow, reads quickly, very sketchy","This was my first Brian Moore novel; I will try one more before giving up on him. This came across more as a ""character study"" of the type assigned in creative writing classes than a serious novel. It was episodic and incomplete. The best part was the descriptions of Lambert's magic performances. I never felt that Emmeline's erratic behaviors were consistent or credible. As for this book dealing with faith and religion--it doesn't scratch the surface. It is also more proof that you can't judge a book by looking at its cover."
2,disappointing,I found this book to be insipid and maudlin. The dialogue was amaturish and the characters are folks you just don't care about. The better than average descriptions of the French court and the Algerian desert are not redemption enough for anyone who loves books to read this one.
1,"I am a Brian Moore fan, and could not finish this book","I have read a number of Moore's earlier works. Reading the Magician's Wife, I began to wonder if there were 2 Brian Moore's, and actually checked Amazon.In the 1/3 of the book I read, there was no character development, and the characters sketched were insipid. There was also little plot development.For those, apparently few of you, who heard good things about Moore, but shared my view of the book, try Cold Heaven or the Lonely Passion of Judith Hearne (2 VERY different books)."
4,Explores the politics of war and cultures,I found the story very interesting - I chose it because it takes place in France and Algeria however the plot and the characters took over and I couldn't put it down - fascinating.
2,"good idea, but a very boring execution of it","I had heard high praise of Brian Moore, comparing him to Graham Greene; however, I found that to be very misleading. Although The Magician's Wife does have a moral quandary, I wouldn't liken it in any other way to the writings of Graham Greene. There is one exciting, interesting scene in this novel, which doesn't happen until the near end, and it isn't worth reading the rest of this dull novel. None of the characters are fully developed. The main character is sucn a boring and emotionless woman, it is difficult to read the tale from her point of view. Three quarters of the novel is just filler, meaningless description, not even beautifully detailed description, just padding. I give it two stars instead of one because it was an interesting idea, and it does have the one good scene (the magician truly put to test). I...will give Moore one more chance. Perhaps this isn't representative of his work..."
5,a truly great novel,"Although I was apprenhensive at first about reading the story of a 19th century French Magician and his wife, my fears were quickly calmed. the flow of the novel is incredible. i found the novel very difficult to put down. deniau is the perfect villain for the story as he, like most every thing else is an illusion. i actually found myself caring about the characters, particularly bou-aziz and emmeline. a true masterpice."
3,Wandering mind,"While the story seems as if it should have been a good one, the retoric of this novel is so boring that it hardly kept my attention. Moore's novel has potential, but he ruins its development and makes what could have been a magical and enchanting story into a long winded boring novel, reminiscent of a book your English teacher would have made you read in high school."
3,"Fascinating story, shallow characters.","Anyone interested in the historical relationship between Algeria and France or between fundamentalist Muslims and Christians will find the story uniquely absorbing. The characters, however, seem created almost exclusively for the purpose of advancing the plot. We do not really get beyond the surface with the characters of Emmeline, or Lambert, or Deniau, and that limits the reader's involvement. More intriguing than any ""beach book"" you may read because of its subject matter, I'd have enjoyed it better if its characters were not so hollow."
2,"Shame on you, Mr. Moore.","This is a silly little roman à clef taking place in France and North Africa during the rule of Napoleon III (1852-1871). The cover is intriguing and so is the subject matter of the then impending takeover by the French. The story, however, disappoints. The title character is not particularly well cast. She has what are supposed to have been revolutionary thoughts for the time, but the reader is not compelled to care. Mr. Moore was not paying attention to his writing with this book as none of its characters invites interest."
3,A large story told too small.,"Contrary to Christopher Lehmann-Haupt""s critique in The New York Times (""... a story that in less skilled hands might have bloated to 600 pages, but in Moore's seems a bulging 229...""), I found the story frustrating for its brevity. There are stories that merit no more than 229 pages but this is not one of them. The Magician's Wife reads like the synopsis of a story. For example, the historical background on Algeria and its relationship to France is given short shrift. Mr. Moore might argue that this is not the point of the story, that the story is one woman's physical and emotional odyssey, and that this is his focus in the story. But here, too, I felt deprived. The characterization of Emmeline is merely sketched in outline as opposed to a richly detailed portrait. At the book's end I could not venture a guess as to how the heroine would choose to live out the rest of her life."
5,Great read!,"This book was recommended by a friend. I only knew a sliver about codependency until I read this book. It had a thorough understanding of the subject and even used biblical principles to back up her ideas. Great read. A bit rough at first because you deal with harsh truths, but definitely has a hopeful ending."
5,Good,I ordered the workbook and received the text book. This is an excellent book on codependency and very helpful. I wanted the work book for small group study. Is it available?
2,Not Looking For Biblical References for Healing Codepedency,"I thought I was getting this book but received ""From Bondage to Bonding: Escaping Codependency, Embracing Biblical Love. Not my cup of tea."
1,Not for the serious researcher,"What a disapointment! I bought this book for some research I am doing but found its contents to be so unabashedly Catholic party-line that none of it is useful in an academic review. I concede that there is a place for Fr. Elizond's works for the Catholic audience wanting affirmation of their faith, but for my purposes, the experience of buying it makes me realize there is definitely a place for the old fashioned bookstore where you can peruse what you're buying. I wish I could get my money back!"
2,Please note,"While Mr. Elizondo obviously cares deeply about justice, readers should be aware that certain views expressed in this book are definitely not orthodox Catholic/Christian teaching, especially regarding Mary."
3,Older version,This was an older edition than I was expecting. Some of the information is pretty dated.
4,Exegesis explained,The book is easy reading. Hermeneutics is a boring subject to me but this author keeps it interesting and moving.
4,Good teaching material; Very practical and not too advanced.,"Michael Gorman does a great job of addressing the basic steps one should take when doing exegesis of a passage of Scripture. He provides good background material, and exercises to put into practice the reading from each chapter. It's very practical and informative. There are some sections where more examples would have made the concepts easier to understand. It helps if the reader has some exegetical background already and wants to develop a system for good exegesis."
5,Misunderstood Ballet Music,"Most people misjudge opera and ballet. Ballet is not just cutesy dancing for girls. It is a brilliant art form. Tchaikovsky mastered the art of ballet with his famous Nutcraker and Sleeping Beauty, considered to be the greatest ballets to date. The Russian ballet is extremely connected to fantasy and romance. Swan Lake tells the story of a princess turned into a swan. The Act 2 is very colorful in orchestration and dance. The Dance of the Little Swans and the magnificent Waltz are very excellent. In Sleeping Beauty, (the fairy tale has no need for an explanation), Tchaikovsky manages beautiful music, from Marches to a waltz you will be sure to love and a difficult pas'de deux for ballet dancers. These are great ballets and the music is perhaps the most excellent in the field you will hear. I recommend it."
5,Above and beyond many of the other books on the topic,"I have a small library of books on emotional/verbal abuse and its impact is an hourly concern in my life. This book offered me more and better clarity about just what my partner is doing, with a checklist tool, so I can better assess his manipulations and prepare to deal with them proactively. I also gained wisdom about my inability to reach him with my input, a years-old problem, as clearly the abuser doesn't respect or value the abusee's ideas/thoughts/wishes. While sounding obvious, this idea wasn't clear until I read it in this book. Now I can stop trying to ""help"" US and help ME.I would also recommend this to anyone coming from a family of origin in which these irrational behaviors were common, not only those with verbal abuse in significant-other relationships. The book is a godsend!"
4,My viewpoint,Two fairly traditional westerns and one very interesting look at the life of a cowboy.Crossfire Trail and Last Stand at Sabre River are average western stories of good versus evil with the good guys triumphing in the end. These are the sort of films I loved as a teenager and I viewed these with some nostalgia.Monte Walsh was different. It was a little sad and I found that Montes life as a cowboy uncomfortably paralleled my own life. I shed tears for him but liked this film immensely.
4,Tom Selleck Westerns,These may not be the greatest movies but Tom Selleck is the epitomy of the western hero and this movie collection aptly displays his abilities as a modern cowboy. All of these are beautiful movies and illustrate Selleck's acting abilities in modern day western classics.
3,Western collection,The 3 movies in this collection are great. They would only play in 1 of my dvd players and jumped terribly in my PC dvd drive. Only my high priced player would play them so be careful. These 3 movies are the best morden day westerns made good for the whole family. I gave them 3 stars for the playabilty.
4,The Best of Tom,"Tom Selleck is a very good western actor. TNT made a series of westerns for TV, most of them staring Tom Sellect. They are very entertaining films, well written and well acted. I am sure that the viewer wll enjoy these films very much."
4,Good collection,The only one I would suggest they add to this collection is Quigley Down Under which is probably one of the best movies Tom Selleck has done.
4,Makes a Great Gift!,"Always something I wanted but would never go out and buy on my own. I received this set as a gift and thoroughly enjoy watching! Perfect for those who love Westerns with a good story without the need for senseless and gratuitous violence. That is not to say that these shows do not contain violence or mature themes, only that the story is more important than the action. Besides, all three of these movies were made-for-TV. So they were all better than I expected!"
5,Slick Selleck,Tom Selleck was and is one of the best cowboy actors around. Every one of his Westerns are worth having. I wasn't disappointed.
3,Tom Selleck,This is definately not a Jesse Stone movie but is worth a light watch. The plot is pretty much stock and standard but with Selleck in it makes it ok.
3,Good with limitations,"It works great on wide thick rings, but not so well on the latest narrow thin rings like steel nitride compression rings"
3,Works okay but has flaws,Its a bit hard to center the ring and keep it in place long enough to place the ring onto the piston. The product does work infact they are very stable its just the v points where the ring ends fit are way to tight.
3,Acceptable,"OK, but not the best. Will handle a few jobs, but not durable. Spend a few bucks more and get professional quality."
5,Clipping Adam,"Clipping AdamDespite what he says, Adam is not ""fine"". The summer before freshman year should be a time full of possibilities, but Adam struggles with a dad that is drunk, due to the fact that he can't deal with the death of his wife and daughter from a auto accident. Adam has not cut his hair for 2 years, and deals with a high school bully that hates long hair. Fortunately, Adam finds help from friends, a catholic priest, and his grandmother. I found the ending very different than expected."
4,A moving story,"This is a moving story, beautifully conducted. The little boys loses his mom and sister, his dad loses his wife and daughter, his grandma loses two daughters... Each one deal with their losses differently... Adam is not able to deal with it...he needs help and Father Dan will help him, along with his new friends, so everybody can be save and start a new life. Wonderful movie!Kevin Sorbo plays Father Dan, a great therapist who helps Adam to see ahead."
3,family film dealing with death of a parent,"i bought this film because it was recommended under gay films. although i enjoyed the film for what it was, there were no gay characters in the film. dealing with the death of the mother and daughter, the young boy gets in trouble and the father drinks, grandma has to save the day."
5,Keeps me Sane!,"I can';t do Soy or GMO foods, so this is a life saver, haven't had any hot flashes since starting on it."
3,"worked for a while, but then nothing","This was my first success other than HRT for combatting my hot flashes--it worked beautifully for a couple of months, but then quit. I tried increasing the dose until I was taking THREE times the recommended dosage, and there was no change in my hot flashes. I quit at that point, and I've since tried multiple other herbal supplements, with much the same result. Usually half-way through the second or third box or bottle, it just quits working. AAAARRRGGGHHHH! It really was a dream come true for a few months, and I thought I had found THE solution. Oh, well, off to try something else. Good luck to you!"
1,Suck's Really Suck's,"This movie is a experience that nobody should have. It's just so stupid. I haven't saw that, but the name fells stupid. Like I've said, nobody in the whole world, should see that, it's disgusting. Excuse-me I must put this out in bathroom!"
4,Memorable,Truly a film that stays with you for many years. In my late teens I found this to be a very inspirational film. It encouraged respect and discovery of native peoples and their ways and dealt with the often difficult issue of faith communities and their relations with aboriginal peoples.
2,A Short Owl,"""I Heard The Owl Call My Name"" was shown as a television mini-series in 1973. It was wonderful, and I'm afraid the tape I just received is a chopped up, over-edited and miserable version. The events, characters and dialog are the video less-than equivalent of Cliff Notes. Wish I hadn't wasted my money No quality with this release, that's for certain."
1,it sucked,it was the world's most stupid and boring movie. mark brian looked like mr bean when he was supposed to look young. i expected someone half descent looking but what did i get! the plot didn't even go with the book and they missed out SO many parts. I give it THUMBS DOWN!
4,Beach Read,"A long held secret tears the Chandler family apart. Amy, Claire and Mark have always been close but now each is left to struggle with their individual problems AND the secret alone.Resentments come out and it seems as if the family will never find their way back to each other.One will find a wrong love, one will risk a marriage and one will refuse to trust a new relationship.It will take another crisis before things are resolved.A good relationship novel."
1,Broadway style Beethoven,"I was really surprised when I first listened to this Beethoven cycle because I thought I was not sitting in a theater in Vienna but Broadway. Anyway, it's not a really bad choice if you want to try something different after enjoying too many Beethoven's Symphony cycles. However, it would be better to try Bohm/Wiener Philharmoniker, Karajan/Berliner Philharmoniker, Szell/Cleveland, Masur/Gewandhausorchester Leipzig, Klemperer/Philharmonia, Solti/Chicago Symphony or Haitink/Concertgebouw Amsterdam first."
1,Leonard Bernstein Beethoven Collectors Edition,"This Collectors Edition is a complete waste of money. First the disks are mislabled as to the symphony being played. Secondly, Bernstein alternates between music too faint to hear and clashes that would damage your eardrums. Deutsche Grammophon made no attempt at editing."
2,Not a good choice.,"I got this Beethoven Symphony Cycle a few years ago but I barely listened to it, and I thought Bernstein was overrated for his conducting after my first listening to this cycle. The orchestration was not well balanced between string and wind sections, which can be easily noticed in the 6th Symphony particularly in the 4th and 5th movements, as well as in the 3rd and 9th Symphonies. The sound quality is also not good enough since it's a live recording. The overall performance of this cycle shows that the Wiener Philharmoniker acted as a third class orchestra and was not well trained under Bernstein, much worse than with Karl Bohm and Herbert von Karajan. Bernstein may be good at conducting Gershwin, Copland, and probably Mozart however, in my opinion, he was not the right person to conduct Beethoven."
3,A Good Set,"Technically proficient and the recording is first rate (AND it is on 2 CDs instead of the usual 3 so is cheaper). Even so, my loyalties remain with the DG set by Tokyo. They bring out the rhythmic zest of these works even more than the Emerson (who tend to gloss over rhythmic nuances)."
5,Emer Must Be Proud of His Son,"This is probably the best recording of the Bartok Quartets available. These quartets are all masterpieces, every one of them, and only the Emerson Quartet has met MY standards. If you aren't already a huge Bartok fan, I promise you that after listening to this recording a lot, you will become one. PLEASE BUY THIS AND LISTEN TO IT A LOT! As a young composer, these quartets have changed my life. If you are a musician like me, you may want to get your hands on the scores. The Emerson quartet performs with amazing accuracy, intensity, and beauty. FOR THE LOVE OF GOD! , STOP READING THIS REVIEW AND BUY THE DARN THING ALREADY! YOU'RE WAISTING PRECIOUS LISTENING TIME! BUY IT!"
4,Exceedingly close...,"Emerson Quartet makes stunning interpretations; they are not at the pinnacle, but very close to it. DG tend to overprice their selections: for the price of their Shostakovich, you could have both the Borodin (Melodiya) AND Fitzwilliam (London) Quartets, giving superior performances to those of Emerson. As for Beethoven, the Quartetto Italiano (Philips) is unsurpassed.However, Emerson are gorgeous with their early 20th century repertoire of Eastern Europe. Their Webern is the most consistent and fascinating of the Boulez box, and this Bartok is haunting and lovely. Recommended."
4,Really worthy to hear them. New experience on this genre.,"To begin with, you never expect these string quartets look alike those of Haydn, Boccherini, Mozart, or any other peers of romantic period. They seem to derive from the late Beethoven's. Emerson's performance is still greater than hyperion CDs performed by Budapest String Quartet in terms of sonority, clarity,etc. Personally I dare to recommend these CDs to whom already experienced a lot of the same genre. But, while keep listening over and over, I found why they were on a recommendation list in this genre. First I heard, very difficult to enjoy the music itself, with no easy-to-hum melodies, difficulty in recognizing the main theme, etc. More and more over and over, I turned used to them."
4,Excellent,"This is an excellent recording of the Bartok quartets. This music requires careful and repeated listening to really appreciate the structure of Bartok's achievement. The effort is quite worthwhile. Common criticism of this recording is that the Emerson isn't 'rough' enough, presumably meaning even and relatively conventional tempi and intonation. These performances, however, are the work of musicians who aim at being a vehicle of the music rather than drawing attention to themselves. For someone like me, who is listening to these pieces for the first time, this is probably a particularly good introduction to the Bartok quartets. There are other highly praised recent recordings and differentiating among them is a matter of taste."
4,Compositions: Outstanding! Performance: Mixed.,"One reviewer said that Emerson wasn't rough enough. When this was released, I believe it was the roughest interpretation I had ever heard! Over-all, these are very good performances (and 100% accurate). The weakness of these performances is the gentler sections which, though technically perfect, lack feeling and conviction.Béla Bartók: The Six String Quartets - Juilliard String Quartetdoes a very good job of the quiet sections, but lacks power on the aggressive parts.My favorite recording of these pieces isBartók: 6 String Quartetsby the Hungarian String Quartet. Since I bought that I haven't listened to other recordings of this piece."
4,The best of Asia...sort of,"Don't be fooled by the title. This is just their first three albums ""Asia"", ""Alpha"" and ""Astra"" in one package. It's not really a bad idea since everything they've released since then have been commercial failures. If you really want the best of John Wetton and company then go with ""The Very Best Of Asia:Heat Of The Moment (1982-1990)"" or even the 2CD set ""Gold"" which has all the songs here plus some additional tracks. Otherwise, this set will just save you the trouble of getting their first three albums seperately"
3,not really sure if the extra size is worth one extra round...,"The glock 36 is an awesome glock. It's the ONLY one with the slimline frame, designed to be more concealable. The height is the same as the other sub compacts, which also makes the glock 36 very concealable. If you add this mag extension to it, your 36 will be just as tall as a 23 or any other compact Glock. So, if you're not worried about severely reducing the concealability factor of the 36, which is its most attractive feature, this mag extension is great. For me, it's not quite worth the +1. If it were +2, I'd put this on every mag I have. Another thing worth considering is that this adds great bulk to the mag itself, like a bulb on the bottom, so it's not going to be as comfortable in your pocket. Just get a glock 30 or 21 if you want a .45 with a bunch of rounds, and keep the 36 mags as they are so you can really conceal the 36."
4,Soul of Prayer with a unique slant,"P. T. Forsyth takes a unique slant on the soul of prayer. I own this volume, andd it owns me; and I've bought it for others too. Forsyth believes strongly in praying for God's will to be done--no question about it. However, he points out with biblical examples that many of us back into prayer instead of battling into prayer with heart and soul. God answers prayers that mean something to us; and they must mean something to us if they're to mean anything to God. He shows us that God has some blessings for us we won't get unless we ask for them. He shows us that God honors persistent prayer like that of the importunate widow or Jacob or others. I recommend it without reservation."
5,Prayer,Great book on prayer! I would encourage everyone to read it. Its short but to the point. I believe this can set your prayer life on fire.
5,Classis study of Prayer,"This short yet exhaustive examination of the long term practice of prayer blessed my soul, even though i have long been a praying Christian.It is not enough to describe it; you must read it for yourself.May it be a blessing to your life of faith.Nora T Newman"
3,"on site specs were wrong but after i figured them out,a very useful tool.",i like this 2 in 1 tool but information on site said it fit into 13/16 sparkplug socket but it wont fit in that properly.what it does fit in is a 19 mm deep socket.also big end is for o2 sensor. not spark plug.this is a fairly technical tool and you need to clarify this. other than than that i like the tool.
4,Thread Chaser,"I ordered this when I ordered the new O2 sensors, just expecting issues upon removal. As it turns out, this was not needed but it is made of high quality materials. I"
1,Sorry but I must disagree.,"I was a late fan to Elliott Smith-dom. I heard Son of Sam on the radio a few times and picked up the Beatles-esque Figure 8, declaring it one of my favorite albums of all time (I gave that CD five stars in my review). I also picked Elliott's older releases though I didn't enjoy them nearly as much. A common observation on Figure 8 by Elliott's fans and critics is that it is overproduced. I'm not sure I know what that means, but if there was ever an overproduced album, ""from a basement on the hill"" is it. Hmm, how to articulate this? On many of the tracks, it's as if someone in the background is trying to ruin them (much as Jonny Greenwood tried unsuccessfully to do on Radiohead's Creep) by adding a dissonant something extra to each of the songs. I've listened to this album three times now, and shaken my head in disgust after each listen. I was looking forward to the follow-up to the tuneful and supremely melodic ""Figure 8""... tragically, that will never come. RIP Elliott."
2,It just gets worse and worse...,"this album is pretty stinky. i wish it was never put out. just makes me think about how if he were still alive, how each album would be cruddier than the last. figure 8 stinks too, XO is so-so. everything before that is cool. and all heatmiser albums suck too. and, yes, i do know what i'm talking about."
1,Who calls this music?,Don't fall for the other reviews. This is just plain bad music. I actually threw this CD in the trash after trying to listen to it. Never could get through a whole cut.
5,A Masterpiece,"Sadly, I didnt really get into Elliot until after his death. Having previously heard a little from him, I saw this album and decided to pick it up, and was blown away. The first time I listened, I didnt really get it, but each subsequent time I fell more into the music and somehow feel like this is his most soul-bearing work. Its profound sadness is masked by a sometimes heavy electric foreground, but it resurfaces in numbers like 'last hour', 'twilight', and 'lets get lost'. I love that his voice seems to haunt the music and enhance it at the same time. This album just makes the sadness of his needless death that much more frustrating. My favorite songs on this album are ""Pretty (ugly before), and Twilight."
5,Don't Waste Time Reading This - Just BUY IT!,"Some may disagree over what their favorite song on this album is, or what works or doesn't work. But everyone who loves Elliott Smith's music seems to love whatever it was that touched them most, and if you have ever been touched by his work, it's all here... this one's a no-brainer.As it happens, I just read a review that said that King's Crossing doesn't work, but on first listening, it jumped out at me as the best song on the album.I now agree with that reviewer that Pretty (Ugly Before) is probably the strongest overall, but I hope he'll listen to King's Crossing again with Queen in mind, as I think that's part of Elliott's joke, and try to think of this as Bohemian Rhapsody for the 21st century.Oh, yeah, and buy this disc right now."
5,"Great album, no if's or buts...","From a basement.. IS a great album. Don't listen to Kiwimaddog "" Coast to coast- (C) - The only track on the album i think should have been left off. Its not bad for a hard rock song, but this is just not a style Elliott pulls off too well."" I think Coast to Coast is an awesome song that Elliott pulled off great.. I mean actually grading songs. The album flows perfectly, every song is good, and it's my opinion that this is Elliott's best album. When you get done listening to it you'll be sing like two or three of the songs over and over untill you can't help but listening to From a basement on the hill again."
4,another great Elliott album,"Like every Elliott album, From a Basement grows on you more and more with each listen. After hearing a handful of live recordings of this material before the album was released, my expectations were very different since the versions I had heard were very stripped down, raw, and beautiful like most of Elliott's live performances. While very different in their arrangement and texture, the studio recordings of these songs certainly don't disappoint. The album feels like the most cohesive effort of Elliott's since Either/Or. He has not only solidified himself as one of the greatest songwriters of his time, but also as a true master of the studio as a multi-instrumentalist with the ability to add so much color and harmony to his music."
5,"So great, so late","I'm only sorry that I didn't hear of Elliott Smith sooner. This album moves with me from home, to car, to work, and back again. I had only heard a few songs of his before owning this album, but it is already one of my favorites."
4,Descent album,"I am an intermittent fan. I have to really be down in the dumps--trying to have a pity party to finish an album. Sorry RIP, I love the songs, just not all the time."
4,Recommended for students,"My acting students do a semester of the works of Chekhov. Like many performers some of them have trouble reading. They find the assignment to read the four major plays of Chekhov a daunting task. This collection allows them to view the plays in an easy to understand, authentic form, careful to the detail of Russian culture. Sir Anthony Hopkins, to mention one of many noteworthy performances, is wonderful to watch."
2,Over Priced,"This is a low profile tape measure , it does fit easily in your pocket, but it is way over priced and does not have a lock to hold the tape while measuring. After I received it, took a ride to Lowes and they had a 4pack of tape measures for the same price. 4 for the price of 1."
2,Overpriced,This thing is a flimsy measuring tape that gets the job done but has the quality of a dollar store item and is way overpriced on Amazon.
5,A moving performance,"I don't know why there are so many people who dislike thisversion.The music Karajan produced in his late career iswarmer, lighter and more glowing than before. All thosequalities are essential to this opera. Just listen to thefinal trio, you can know why this performance is better thanthe Krajan-EMI, which is emotionaly cooler."
1,A truly wretched recording.,"This recording, made at the 1980 Salzburg Festival, shows how bad a conductor Herbert Von Karajan became in his late years. Whereas his 1956 recording of this opera, with Schwarzkopf, etc. is one of the great recordings of the century, this lifeless, uninvolved, artificial performance is simply bad. And the singing is actually pretty good. Although Anna-Tomowa Sintow is no Schwarzkopf, she does well enough with the Marschallin, and the smaller roles are done with nice characterization. But the sluggish, barren contributions of Karajan destroy any decent work from his cast. To be avoided at all costs."
1,worse than useless,"I have been taking Sytrinol for over two months and tested my cholesterol a few days ago. I was expecting a 20-30% reduction, but instead my cholesterol reading was much higher. I took the test twice more to make sure and it came out the same. I have not otherwise changed my diet in this time, so my conclusion is that Sytrinol most likely does not work at all. It looks like a con."
2,I wanted to like it but...,"I found this book confusing and in general not particularly helpful. If you are not planning to use Cold Fusion then I would say definitely avoid this book, since some of the chapters required Cold Fusion to work through the examples. It is poorly organized and I quickly got tired of working with the Newmanzone sites that are used as examples (""all profits for me"" is cute, but gets old fast, especially when the step-by-step instructions don't work). Overall it felt like there was a lack of flow to the book."
1,Very Disappointing,"What a waste. This book is half written. It assumes that the reader, who is a beginner in CF. is somehow going to intuit what to do and how to complete his half-explained examples. This is a waste of money. I spent 12 hours this weekend working through half of the book and am just as confused and lost as I was when I started -- he got me more confused. I was particularly annoyed by references he make to information in chapters that were yet to be covered (e.g. in Chapter 1, he refers to info in Chapter 5) -- talk about adding to confusion -- how could a publisher let him get away with this? Junk like this has just become so standard in computer books - write any ... and people will buy it. Newman, every thought of making salad dressing instead?"
1,frustrating,Avoid this book. Very poorly organized. Flipping back and forth all the time gets frustrating. AAAAGGGGHHHHH! I recommend books from the Friends of Ed dreamweaver series.
5,You get more than just a book when you make this purchase.,"I found this book to be exactly what I needed (and had been looking for for quite a while): information that capitalized on my UD4 experience and helped make the transition to DWMX, concrete examples that led to building two great sites, a side-by-side comparison of Cold Fusion MX to help me figure out what all the CF hullabaloo was about, and a sense of humor in the writing.As mentioned by an earlier reviewer, there is one time where the book calls for an extension that must be purchased ... and a couple of times where extensions must be utilized which reportedly do not work with MX (they do work-the author's book support site tells you how to make very minor code tweaks). This should not be enough to make anyone decide not to purchase the book. The author's book support site ... is truly supportive and helped me with above issues very quickly.Buy the book. It's absolutely essential."
3,The Pain of Dreamweaver,"This is definitely not a bad book, if used in conjunction with several others. The real estate site seems to work but lots...lots of steps are missing along the way. Apparently the author knows what he is doing but forgets that we don't, hence that's why we bought the book.Good content, 'Horrible' instructor/author."
3,Quallity Tool,Quality tool but misrepresented in the description and photo. Make sure to check the part number with the manufacturer to get the proper bolt cutter. I had to send mine back due to incorrect capacity.Made in the USA.
5,A wonderful compilation from an intelligent author.,"This book gives a great overview of the philosophical underpinnings of modern thought, as told from the perspective from a Neo-Thomist. Gilson is a master of his trade, as evinced by the fact that the book is very readable (at least for students of Philosophy!). In my lowly opinion, this is a definitive work that should be on every serious philosophy student's shelf, and it is a shame that no one is reprinting it at this time, so grab up all the available copies while you can!"
3,Scholarly book,"This book is a difficult one to read. You had better be highly motivated to learn about the topic, and you had better know a little about theology before you start this book. It is for scholars and dedicated students only."
3,Good for its time,"This may have been one of the better Pollack books when it came out in 1972, but now I think its main use is for die hards who want every detail. And the details are exhausting: galleries, museums, who what where - too much for me. What I was looking for was more process/personal/mindset stuff, and there is some but you have to go through a lot to get to the little of it there is. I recommend ""Jackson Pollack"" by Ellen G. Landau. Great reproductions and good text."
4,Authentic and sober analysis,"I appreciated the authenticity of the author's encounter with Pollock, and the unselfconscious manner of his writing--meaning: he didn't write to elevate his own perception, but to illuminate Pollock and his rich environs and influences. The author's intelligence enriches our understanding of Pollock, and does so in as timely a manner now as in the 70's when the book was originally written."
3,This is a print on demand book,"And the photographs suffer for it; large blocky scanner artifacts make the photographs muddy, and unclear. If you want to see decent photos, then this is not the edition to buy."
4,On Thin Ice,This author creates characters that you can take an interest in getting to know more about and smooth flowing story lines.
4,Not as good as....,"Cherry Adair's first book, ""Kiss and Tell"", I must say that out of all the Wright's family stories, Marnie's story was the best. Although, this book featuring Derek was better than the other Wright brother's stories. That's just my opinion."
3,"Average Romance, Fast Read.","This was an easy, fast read. I did like the fact that Derek really seemed to love Lily.Several points that were hard to believe: The romance that happens while racing the Iditarod, harder still to believe is Derek (the sexiest man around) having been celibate for 6 years. I couldn't quite get the time-line of her & her husband Sean not being together since the night of their honeymoon. Her staying with him thru his illness (even though it seems like he led a very active life with only 6 months to live). Please correct me if I am wrong but did I lose 3 years of his life?The whole bull sperm plot & terrorism didn't ring true. If I accept that romance novels are for fun & nothing else this was an average romance novel."
2,Not her best effort,"Three years ago Derek and Lilly had briefly dated. The number of dates were so few, it wasn't enough to convince me that these two had anything going on between them or were eventually meant to be together . And Lilly's reaction to Derek and what she did as a result of that reaction, just left me going, huh? It was such a ludicrous thing to do that the story began to crumble around me.The story starts out slow with a lot of back-story filler. The race itself was interesting, but getting to it was tedious. And the story never seems to recover until the very end, which was a bit over the top. But unlike stupid heroines, I welcomed implausible action.This is not a terrible book, but considering the talent, this book could have been so much better. When I pay hard cover prices, I expect a little more than average effort on the part of an author"
2,Has Parabens.,"Bought this cream for a gift and when I received it read the ingredients, it contains all the Parabens in the market, so I cannot really say anything about the product myself because I didn't try that on my skin, according with my friend is a good moisturizer, but I won't buy again, for me or anybody else."
5,Inspirational!!,"The book has depth and expression of heart. I have given the it to several couples to read and do inventory of their ability to express heart to each other. Saylor takes words and makes a melody with them. It is a book for NEW couples as well as ""seasoned"" couples. I love it!Pastor J. Grove"
3,not as good as the welder's handbook,"good detail on oxyacetylene but very sketchy on arc/mig/tig. not enough charts/graphs. a better resource is ""the welder's handbook"" by richard finch (also 4.00 cheaper)."
3,Good book for a beginner - if it can be trusted,I purchased this book to learn how to gas weld and it does have a lot of information on this topic as well as other aspects of welding. It seems like an ideal book for a novice welder. Various aspects of welding are explained in detail and the illustrations are pretty good. I did find a few typos in the book but most were minor. Overall I would recommend this as a good book for novices to learn welding basics or improve their skills.
4,Liszt in all his splendor,"Krystian Zimmerman has a talent for bringing to the music he performs a feeling of his having spoken to the composer about his intentions in the music he composed. These performances provide a very moving and rousing feeling of Liszt as he intended this music to be played. He and the orchestra play most persuasively the pianissimo passages with unity and also the fortissimo passages with passion and splendor. If you have heard these compositions by other soloists, you'll most definitely want to hear and own these also because they shine above the average performance."
5,"Demonstration Class, a Great Recording","Although I don't count Zimerman in the most exalted class of interpreters (despite his flawless pianism), this is a phenomenal record by any standards, the only real competition to the Richter recording of these same works. Zimerman's technical address is so all-encompassing, his sense of nuance so complete, that he makes these works sound diabolical, especially Totentanz, by far the best I've heard. The Totentanz makes leads one to think that Zimerman must have a terrific sense of humor, so clever and tastefully garish (if you can imagine it) does he make the piece sound.One reviewer called the Liszt Concertos ""bad good music"" and Totentanz ""good bad music"", which sums it up perfectly, and Zimerman's taste in the former and relish in the latter are apparent everywhere on this glorious disc. All in all, a fine companion to the other disc of his that I would unreservedly recommend, his stunning Brahms sonatas."
4,Great performance but....,"Whilst I would agree with most of the comments re. the performance of these pieces, there can be no doubt that DG have no idea how to balance a piano with an orchestra. I'ts okay in the quiet passages, but during the louder sections, the piano is louder than the orchestra! So you turn down the volume to a realistic level for the piano, and then the orchestra sounds as if they are 50 yards behind the piano. Why can't recording engineers set a realistic level for the piano, or at least place the microphones at a sensible distance from the sound board?"
5,Excellent performances by a great pianist,"Krystian Zimerman is one of the greatest pianists of the modern era. His technique is outstanding, but it is the superb artistry of his performances which makes him one of the few truly great pianists currently performing. Another reason that Zimerman's performances are consistently outstanding is that he is guite selective in what he performs and records. He limits his repertoire to music which he personally likes and with which he feels empathy, rather than simply recording whatever the public wants to buy.Personally I love the Liszt piano concertos and I'm grateful that Zimerman chose to record them. His performances are superb. Yes, these works in parts have the bombast typical of Liszt, but they are beautiful nevertheless and many passages are exquisitely lyrical. If you think of these compositions as tired old warhorses, please acquire this CD and let Zimerman's outstanding artistry reveal them to you as the masterpieces they are."
4,GFR improved with time.,"This is one of those albums that I have always loved but don't know if anyone else listened to it. My favorite track is; I CAN FEEL HIM IN THE MORNING. A very soulful, heartfelt song that shows Mark Farner had a lot more depth and songwriting skill than given credit for. Other songs that still really move me are; COUNTRY ROAD, COMFORT ME, and I WANT FREEDOM. Their version of GIMME SHELTER is only OK. This is my favorite GFR album and Phoenix is a close second."
3,"Maybe GFR's ""Sgt Pepper?"" NAH: THAT'S an oxymoron!","OK, up front, I have to admit, Grand Funk was never, EVER on my list of ""bands to be listened to while I was stoned."" Farner irritated the mortal #&$# out of me with his ""crowd-as-many-notes-as-you-can-into-one-measure"" guitar ability, and Brewer's ""percussion"" can only (honestly) be described as masturbatory. So you have NO IDEA the angst it triggered in me when I heard that GFR had (giggle) ""covered"" the all-time-#1 GREATEST rock 'n roll song EVER, ""Gimmie Shelter."" THAT, I HAD to hear, and, to be sure, it stunk. However, The first song, ""I Want Freedom"" almost made up for the rest of the album's myrid shortcomings. The line, ""I want freedom, the kind that was promised me/Just for living in this country"" shows that Mark, Mel, & Don MUST have listening to something BESIDES dead zepplen or blacque sabbath. Get the CD for that one song; I'm just surprised that some abberant political group hasn't made it their ""rallying chant"" or something..."
5,Kick-start your brain!,"I'm not sure how Cochrane can contain such a diversity of thought within a single mind but I'm very thankful that he can. The broad sweep of these essays has truly opened my eyes to the inexorable and interwoven position of technology in all aspects of our lives. Technology is not ""out there"" it's ""in here"". I feel more awake, better educated and perhaps a little afraid. Read this book to kick-start your brain, evolve your own ""uncommon sense"" and get involved in the dialogue. Cochrane is expert at illuminating our shadowy future. The issues addressed are some of the most important of our times. I highly recommend this book if you want to know what technology ""means""."
4,A great read!,"This book was an extremely interesting read. It gives you lots to think about in our computer-centric world. Cochrane may come off as a little odd at first, but the more you read the more interesting points he brings up. It gives the reader a perspective that you wouldn't get from the more mainstream tech editorials. Definitely worth the read."
1,Who wants to hear someone blaming everyone for their problems,"I got this book hoping for an inspiration. But instead all I got was a grown man blaming everyone for his problems. Oh My God! Save your $20 and go somewhere else for inspiration. How this book ever got published, I will never know. I have enough problems in my life without paying $20 to hear someone whining."
2,Let down by an imperfect cast,"The sound made by the Metropolitan Opera Orchestra under Levine is gorgeous! What Levine may not provide much insight to Wagner's splendid drama, his interpretation is dramatic and flowing. This surely is the sets greatest asset.Unfortunately, the performance is let down by the cast. Gary Lakes is just a mediocre Siegmund. Jessye Norman's Sieglinde is vocally shining but dramatically unconvincing. James Morris's Wotan is quite authoritative. Unfortunately, his voice is not of great quality and his singing can sometimes be monotonous. Hildegard Behrens disappoints as Brunnhilde, for his voice, though shining in the upper reaches, sounds rather slender and is not heroic enough for the warrior maiden.A pity that Levine and DG cannot get a better cast to record this work."
3,mediocre performance,"While the MET's orchestra under Levine gives a wonderful performance, the vocal performance is not impressive at all. Behrens's Brunnhilde is quite good until her resources are taxed by some strenuous passages. Morris's Wotan is vocally secure but dramatically boring. Lakes is just adequate as Siegmund and Norman is not convincing as Sieglinde. Ludwig, however, is a fine Fricka."
4,now here's my coffee table book,"very similar in content to the other bennet book, but definately worth it. nice photography, plenty of muddy rovers, as well as a lot of cool shots of the rover assembly line."

3,Weller D550 Soldering Gun,"The Soldering Gun I received did not have working lights. Also, the coating on the factory soldering tip emits a bad odor for the first few uses. You might want to heat it up outside, or by a strong vent, when first using, until the odor is gone. Amazon was good to have the repair of the lights, by a local technician, reimbursed to me. The Soldering Gun has worked fine since. I would blame any trouble on Quality Control at the Weller factory. No product should leave the factory without being checked for proper operation, in my opinion."
2,"Good name, bad gun","I used it for about 10 minutes and the gun smoked from the housing and then died right there in my hand. Amazon was quick to replace it and the second one has worked fine. Through the years I have gone several of these guns. One improvement that could be made is the way the tips are mounted and secured. There has to be a better way that their engineering department could update their design. Other than that it is a good, not great gun."
2,"Good treatment of an important topic, but too much ideology","Genetic engineering is something that certainly needs to be discussed more. Kneen gathers all kinds of critiques of the technology into one source, making this book very handy. On the other hand, he admits an opposition to biotech in any form, and in fact to much of technology in general, and this bias and one-sided view seems evident within his writing. One may well leave with a false impression that all Monsanto's critics are so close-minded - if you can tune out his rhetoric though, this is certainly recommended as a warning sign against genetic engineering."
2,OK for short cuts,"They are very sturdy and if the item you cut is no longer than 3 inches, these will work well. If you try to cut a sheet of metal, a can opener would probably work as well. Reason: The bolts on the side of the snips prevent engagement of the blades."
1,garbage,"Horrible snips, does not open wide enough...also the teeth are not sharp nor is the bite. I tried to return it but, I got a free refund without having to return and now its just laying there."
2,Like junk food,"Reading The Wives of Bath is like eating a candy bar that isn't your favorite; it's fine while you're reading it -- entertaining enough -- but after you're done, you're still unsatisfied. The characters are a little too extreme (the environmentalist is way over the top with his reusing prophylactics, the magazine writer a little too self-absorbed to be real), the situations beyond contrived. Nonetheless, it's not the worst way to spend an afternoon -- provided you really have nothing better to do."
1,turgid and unsupported,"This book fails to assess WCF in the light of scripture. It often extrapolates beyond scripture or the writing of the WCF authors. Case in point - p3 ""All men know God."" Rom 2:14 (...) does not say this, neither does Ps 14:1, rather ""the fool says in his heart there is no God."" Regretably this book abounds in such stuff, and liberally uses 'straw-man' arguments to support assertions."
1,Cosmi DVD Ripper RIPOFF,This software does not work. I am glad I paid less than 10.00 for it. I guess you really do get what you pay for.
1,Garbage!!,"This software sucks!!!!OMG im stupid i shouldve checked the review first.Oh well, i learned my lesson, there goes my five dollars down the drain.Piece of s**T software cant do S**T!Deserve no star at all!! It deserves my middle finger!! I wish the software designer was here right in front of me so i can chuck the cd @ him!!"
1,As Packaged__A LIMITED FUNCTION or OEM VERSION,"THIS SOFTWARE CD EXACTLY AS PICTURED is developed by Pinnacle . Cosmi markets it. Much like Sears sells Kenmore refrigerators. Someone else, Pinnacle of CAlifornia in US apparently developed the CODE.NOTHING IN OR ON THE PACKAGING TELLS ANYONE THAT BUYER MUST 'BUY UP' TO HIGHER LEVELS OF SOFTWARE SUCH AS PLUS VERSION OR ULTIMATE VERSION TO GET DVD RIPPING/SAVING BACKUP FEATURES. After a SLOWWWWWW install on a 'BIG BOX'2 yr old WIN XP PC A second PDF FILE installed tells one about the UPGRADE'need'. NOTHING on the CD itself or CD CASE SLEEVE tells user ahead of time!!!!!!!"
4,"DVD Ripper, is a snap","Not bad for the bucks. There are some commercially available DVD's which cannot be copied, so this software does not get around that. But for the money, and simplicity, it aint too bad."
2,Been a long time,First of all this does convert dvd movies to mpeg I wanted this so I could leave the movie on my laptop with out taking the disk with me. It takes 3.5 to 4 hours to copy them to the computer. This is the drawback.If you want to copy the movie to a disk the program compresses the movie so much it is useless sometimes leaving part of the movie out.
1,never buy this one!,buy COSMI DVD Ripper Suite (Windows) insted of this one. this one works not as fast.
1,abysmal,"I bought the full retail ""suite"" at $19 which also includes this product. It doesn't do anything-- just like some other reviewers say on this and the retail package. It wouldn't even recognize that there was a DVD in the DVD player. I don't mean that it wouldn't see the player-- I mean it couldn't read DVDs at all. Apparently, judging from other posts, it simply is incompatible with some DVD players. Also, when you run the program the display is all squeezed together so that you cannot change many options. Customer service sent me on the run around for another week and finally just about admitted that they know their software doesn't do anything. They also would not refund my money. I threw this junk software away-- it is so bad that I couldn't bring myself to foist it on someone used. Go with shareware instead. I will never buy another product from COSMI."
1,wrong item,"I was trying to copy ""The Butterfly Effect,"" but the DVD Ripper didn't do anything. On the other hand, I was able to copy the movie with DVD Ripper Suite. You know, there are two different products on the market: DVD Ripper and DVD Ripper Suite(this one works). Make sure you buying the right one."
5,excellent,This is my second order. My first order was unflavored. I prefer the Raspberry Lemon flavor. I am using with a detox diet.However this is an excellent way to ensure getting enough Magnesium in your diet.
5,Great combination of minerals..and easily digestible.,The addition of Vit D and Boron are excellent ..I wish I known about this a couple of years ago .
5,aptly named product,"Have been using Natural Calm for 6 years. Highly absorbable form of magnesium helps with nutritional balance and is a quick-acting, gentle muscle relaxer/tension tamer. If you take calcium supplements or eat a lot of dairy, you might consider supplementing with magnesium. Calcium is used in contracting muscles; magnesium is used in relaxing them. If you have a lot of calcium in your system and not enough magnesium, those muscles can't completely relax! My old massage therapist gave this to every client before his/her massage; she said she didn't have to work as hard to relax stubborn, tense muscles after folks had taken this. Hubby takes it on business trips to keep all systems balanced and avoid tension headaches from Atlanta airport! This is hands-down the best price I've seen for the product, and it was delivered to my door. Can't beat that."
2,Don't get Orange flavor,"orange seemed most appealing to me, but I do not like it. It works, but I have to build up to it. I just really don't like drinking it. It is really tart, slightly orange tasting, and I have a hard time getting it down. I have to chug it quickly. I'd rather take a pill and get it over with quickly. Just blech. I'd rather take Bluebonnet Calcium/Mag Vit D liquid, and that is a thick goopy liquid but I only need 2 TB of it. This is just hard drinking a whole glass. Aside from the texture/sense issue, the product works well, and I don't get restless legs at night. It does help me sleep and I am in a better mood since taking it."
3,Feel high and drugged??,"Took some last night and feel asleep great and was refreshed the next day. Wasn't what i was expecting because i went to sleep lateand woke up early. Had a great nights rest though. The only problem i have is that if i take too much, lets say 1 teaspoon i feel high(drugged). I seriously begin to feel this way and if any one can help i am wondering why? Is it because i am so deficient in magnesium that it turns out this way? Any body who seriously knows there stuff and knows what their talking about is welcome to help. Thank you."
5,works great!,"I have always had trouble sleeping and refuse to take sleeping pills. My healthcare provider suggested I try this. It really does work. The first night I took it, I slept well and even fell back asleep when I woke up to use the restroom. Even through a snoring spouse. An added bonus is that I stopped getting leg cramps from running. My husband has restless leg, especially after running 4 miles so he tried it and has not had any issues since. We take a teaspoon every night now. It is a little tangy, but it is not a bad flavor; kind of like a sour lemonade candy."
2,YUCK,"I bought this product, based on many positive reviews, and was not satisfied. I got the original flavor, which I followed the directions while preparing it. First of all, it is vile. My husband tried it also and agreed it is like the taste of acid, and burns the throat just as bad. I purchased this in hopes of getting some relief from my anxiety and also to relieve my IBS. To put it nicely I'm lucky to ""poo"" twice a week, but when I'm stressed it is non stop. So every week is different. This product boasts its ability to regulate you, as well as to relieve stress and anxiety. I have not found this to be true so far. The taste is hard enough to get over, but it is not the worst part. After drinking it my stomach fills with air to the point that it is painful. I still can't ""poo"" but my husband will not be pleased tonight while I fart all over him in my sleep. It sounds funny, but it sucks. I gave it two stars only because I seem to be the exception rather than the rule. I am disappointed."
1,Over-rated,"I have been taking this product for less than a week now as prescribed. I have not noticed any difference in my anxiety level(worse if anything). Since I have trouble with constipation as well, I was hoping it would help with that. No such luck. By the rest of the reviews, I was really counting on it working, but have so far been very disappointed. If things change, I will re-review this product."
2,Nothing great day 2,I bought this product once before and took for about a week. I did not notice it helping with sleep. I continued to wake every night. I also don't notice that it calms me down. I just had a screaming match after taking 1 teaspoon in hot water and hour before. Maybe it takes a longer time to notice? I didn't notice anything the last time either but I will continue to take it as I need magnesium.
1,Dissapointed,I read all the reviews before buying this product. I can not tell a difference by taking this supplement. I think it may have caused upset stomach. For the caling effect I have noticed nothing. I have been taking a week and a half and will allow more time
1,Beware: 8 oz only!!!,"The weight of this product was not specified by the seller and the picture is too blurry to see the details. The product description says 10+ oz, but it's only shipping weight. The actual bottle you get is only 8 oz.I was very disappointed when the product arrived and saw the tiny little bottle. Won't purchase this item again."
2,does not work-causes loose bowles,I have been taking this for several days on the advice of my acupuncturist and it has not had any effect on my chronic muscle pain and also has caused me to have loose bowls when going number 2 in the bathroom.does anybody know of a product that can help get lactic acid build up out of muscles?
2,"calm, yes... but at what price?","I am disappointed to report that although this product did seem to have an effect on my anxiety the first time I took it, the second time I took it, it made me very nauseated. It may be the stevia; I am quite sensitive to artificial sweeteners (although I thought stevia was natural). At any rate, I am going to have to get rid of this product because I'd rather be anxious than vomiting. Call me crazy. If you are sensitive to non-sugar sweeteners, you may want to try a sample of this beforehand if you can find one before you shell out the money."
5,Great product and service as always...,First time I tried this. Ordered it for a friend who has trouble sleeping. She said it helped. I will start on it as soon as my current supply of magnesium citrate is depleted. Gread product and service as always...
3,NOT magnesium + calcium,"I purchased this as a calcium-magnesium supplement for my kids. This particular bottle does NOT have calcium as the picture of the nutrition label states. That label belongs to a different product. This is 325mg Magnesium citrate only, and it is Really tart!! Now I am going to have to buy (and get the kids to take) a separate calcium supplement.:("
5,Calm magnesium suppliment,"An outstanding product, excellent value and the results are impressive. Blood pressure, stress and anxiety all much lower and energy much increased. Highly recommend!"
5,Great Supplement,THis is so good for you and It tastes good too.If you put it with orange juice you can't even tell the difference. definitely a must buy. Great for getting greatly needed nutrients in reluctant kids AND adults.IT HAS in 3 rounded teaspoons:350mg of Magnesium230mg of Calcium Carbonate115mg of Potassium290mg of Vit C115IU of Vit D3290mcg of Boron
4,one of my favorite supplements,"Magnesium deficiency can affect all aspects of health. I have tried various magnesium supplements, and this is my favorite. I feel, as the label says in bold letters, more CALM when I take this. There is less muscle tension in my body. I enjoy the taste as well, mixed with just 3-4 ounces of hot water, for a soothing warm lemon drink. I often take this with my calcium hydroxyapatite supplements, since both will work better together.Down sides: Need to be careful when making it, or it will fizz itself up and out of your cup. Also, if you get loose stools, adjust your dose down because it means you are taking more than you can absorb. Unfortunately, this is also a sign that your body isn't ABLE to absorb magnesium properly, in which case you may need to look into temporary IV or topical formulas until this is addressed."
4,It really works.,I give this supplement to my son before bed every night. I was advised that Magnesium can aid in preventing headaches and migraines. It also helps to calm and sooth my children before bed. I find it very helpful. And it's all natural!
3,Both good and bad results,On the good side it helps me with nighttime leg cramps.On the bad side it gives me diarrhea.Trying to change the amount to see if I can lessen the bad results...
5,CALM IS AMAZING,"I started taking CALM at the recommendation of a friend of mine that knew I had some emotional issues about a week before my period. I started taking CALM at night and literally started sleeping deeper than I've ever slept before and remembering my dreams. Additionally, I am definitely more relaxed during the day particularly during that time of the month. I will be taking this forever!!!"
5,Calm a wonderful Product,"I have been using Calm, for years, and love it... I especially like the Rasberry Lemon. I order it now on Amazon, because it is a better deal here, than in the stores.I order the 16oz...I take a tablespoon at night with warm/hot water...it really helps regulate me, it is wonderful...I have my father on it who is 90 years young... He only needs to take a teaspoon, but it works for him..."
5,best product to calm myself,I like this Natural Calm for the taste and for calming down. I do not have to take any medication because this is just perfect.
2,Don't get it.,"I bought this at the recommendation of a friend who uses it religiously. I'm not sure now, after using it for 90 days, what exactly it was supposed to do for me. It neither helped nor hurt me in any way. It was just a fruit flavored hot drink at bedtime. I see so many 5 star reviews for this product, so it must be me. I bought mine at the local Vitamin Shoppe store and paid a ridiculously high 34.00 for 16 oz. that said, I see no reason to buy it again. Any insights from users as to what I was supposed to gain by drinking CALM would be appreciated. Thanks."
2,Tastes dreadful to me,"If you enjoy sour tastes, this product might suit you. I dislike the flavor of the stuff so much that I drank it for about three nights and then gave up. It's just a matter of personal taste; I'm sure it will suit plenty of people just fine. I can't speak to the product's efficacy since I couldn't stand drinking it frequently enough for it to work."
4,Does the job,This does what I wanted and helps with my sleeping at night. It has also helped during my pregnancy to stop contractions that I get from time to time that rest and hydration don't stop. I didn't realize this had stevia in it when I first bought it which I actually try to avoid. Because of this I turned around and bought the original unflavored natural calm that has no stevia. I have my husband use this one and then I use the stevia free.
5,Helps with PVC's,"I don't think that I will ever be without Natural Calm. I have PVC's so bad that it feels like my heart is going to jump out of my chest. With just 1 teaspoon of Natural Calm, my heart settles right down. This has also helped with my high blood pressure!"
4,Might be working?,"I am an anxiety ridden person who just needs to calm down, so I tried this. I think it has helped a little with restful sleep. It also impacts bowel movements, so watch your dosage. Read the directions: it needs to fizz in warm water before you drink it. There's a raspberry-lemon flavor I would probably have liked better but didn't see it until after I ordered. The flavor is bitter but it's such a small drink (2-3 oz) that it's acceptable.I think valerian root works better for immediate relief. This needs a longer time period to work well."
3,not as impressed,"as the rest... Have been taking the product for over 3 weeks. Didn't notice any improvement or change in anything, and it tastes AWFUL>"
4,some things don't calm down,"Needed a sleep aid, The reviews amazed me so I ordered some. Brought it back with me from the states to Costa Rica. Finally opened it up, tried it before bedtime, went easy on the quantity due to reviewers suggestions. Next morning, I did feel like I slept well enough, but the bowels were very active. So be very easy on the tiny spoonful of it is all I can say. It takes a lot for me to have loose bowels. This is like a natural laxative. I don't use it every night though. Don't want to worry I need to stay home to be near the toilet."
4,Great product,Calm products are wonderful. Used as directed will bring positive results. I gave this a 4 star rating because I tried the orignal flavor Calm and like it better.
4,Great Stuff,"This stuff is great, while I don't like this kind as much as the Natural Calm with Calcium, it was my own fault for not looking close enough when I ordered the second bottle for the office. I actually look forward to having this in the AM with my breakfast and in the PM before bed. You can feel the relaxation slightly, it is not overwhelming. Not the kind of thing that knocks you out when you take it, but if you pay attention you can feel it.The great thing about the calcium is it is a great way to help sustain and maintain weight loss. This is the best flavor they offer no doubt about it."
4,Very tart,"Pluses: well thought out product, very necessary, read up on Magnesium vs Calcium consumption while you are at it.Minues: more tart (i.e. acidic) than you would expect from a vitamin supplement. Highly acquired taste.Not sure there is an alternative product. Maybe someone can comment on this review and let me know of one."
4,TANGY,"This powder is very tangy! The flavor is such that I don't want to take it each night, but will take it when I am stressed, sick or need to sleep, without hesitation. I gave a LARGE serving to a friend who said they slept well, felt happy and easily went to the restroom (which had been the issue that lead to taking this)."
5,Good Product,"Item received as advertised, on time and in great condition. I am glad that I found this item online, as it is very expensive in the stores that sell such products as this one. Overall I am very pleased and will continue to purchase as needed."
5,Every night,"I have used this every night for over 5 years. I love it. Being a long distance runner, it has really helped me with a variety of things that were clearly caused by a lack of magnesium."
4,natural vitality. natural calm raspberry lemon flavor,NATURAL CALM is a great relaxing magnesium supplement. This product will balance your calcium intake and restore healthy magnesium levels. This product also helps reduce stress after a hard days work! Use as derected.
5,great product,I really love this product! The Raspberry Lemonade tasted very good. It actually does help me sleep through the night!
5,Best stuff on earth,"My wife and I use this every night before we go to bed. It is just as natural to us as breathing...we can really tell a difference in our health without it!! I would advise anyone over 35 years old to use this stuff!! Our last order was for 5 16 oz., Rasberry Lime and that order was placed on September 19, 2011...I'm back at Amazon to buy another 5 containers!! BTW...If you purchase this at your local health food store or vitamin store prepare to pay BIG TIME for this...We had a chiropractor try and sale us a 16 oz., bottle for $43.00! Amazon, is the best deal on the web!!!"
4,Calm Magnesium Powder,"I tried this to relax my muscles and help me sleep better after a recommendation from a chiropractor. It is one of the best supplements I have taken; even with my bad neck I am sleeping deeper than at anytime in my life since I was a small child and still wake up feeling refreshed. I preferred the organic orange to the lemon raspberry but it's only available in smaller containers, however it is a monthly must-buy for me."
4,Helped Spouse That Has Fibromyalgia,"I originally purchased Natural Calm to help with my own insomnia and anxiety issues. I started out with 1/2 teaspoon and gradually worked up to 1 teaspoon taken before bedtime. If I take more than 1 teaspoon, it has a laxative effect the next day. Even though it does help me relax, it doesn't really help with the insomnia. I've recently switched to Slow-Mag for a more sustained release of magnesium throughout the day. It doesn't have the same laxative effect, plus helps with daytime anxiety. However, my spouse (who has fibromyalgia) has had positive results with Natural Calm. It has improved his quality of sleep and also helped with muscle aches and overall fatigue. He takes about 1 to 1/2 teaspoons each night. I anticipate that he will want to continue purchasing Natural Calm. It doesn't work the same for everyone, but we are very happy with how the product has helped him so far."
1,I did not receive this product,"I'm sure I would have liked it had I received the right product. I got the plain, unflavored Natural Calm instead and got a refund because it was not the product I ordered."
2,calm,Calm makes me sleep all night with just a little bit and does help with the irregularity. Unfortunately it makes me tired all the next day...cant snap out of the tired feeling..so this is not for me.
2,"Works okay, but wears off","I have low magnesium and have trouble absorbing it from pills. This powder was recommended. The first few times I took the normal dose, I felt instantly drowsy and relaxed. After the first week of taking it, the relaxed feeling stopped happening altogether. Also if I take it regularly I do get diarrhea.Not really sure if I should recommend it or not. Apparently it was doing something initially, but I don't feel the effects anymore. I was hoping that this would help me sleep and help calm my muscle spasms. Those benefits only lasted about 3 days, so probably won't re-purchase.I got raspberry lemon and the taste was fine."
5,"Tastes great, good source of magnesium - essential to metabolize calcium","I've been using this product for several years now. It tastes great and is a wonderful warm drink before bed. Not to shill for Amazon, but they do price it right when freight is free. Just wish they offered a subscription service for it as they do with some other products.Peter Gillham Natural Magnesium Calm Orange -- 16 oz"
4,Calm,Product was as promised. I found that it lessened the cramping I was getting. I also actually enjoyed the taste.
4,"Good, but FAR TOO SWEET!!","I use this to calm my generally overactive system, deal with stress and sleep better, and it's not unpleasant. It's sweetened with Stevia, which I prefer to any other sweetener. One star off: it's horribly SWEET!! Most American-made sweet goods are sweet to such a degree that sometimes it's hard to detect any other taste, but even by those standards this stuff is incredibly oversweetened. I'll use it, but I wish there were another, less sweet and more natural flavor available. How about, say, mango or grape...?"
5,Yes.,"Before I bought this I read all the reviews and they are all pretty accurate. It's a great product. I take 1.5 tsp twice a day once in the morning and once at night. It helped me sleep better, it made going to the bathroom easier, I wasn't craving junk food as much as usual (I'm usually pretty healthy about what I eat), and I just felt better in general. Great product I would give it 10 stars if I could!"
5,Trip down memory lane . . .,"I still have my old Keats books. They are pretty delicate and I got this to introduce my two boys to Keats. It is a great collection, some of the stories my boys love to hear over and over again.A great buy and most of his stories are still in print."
4,Great book for classrooms,"I'm a pre-k teacher and I bought this book as part of a unit we're doing on Ezra Jack Keats. It has all the Peter stories, plus a copy of the picture of the child who inspired Peter. One thing to know is that each story's layout is very different than the original picture books. There are missing illustrations (including some of my favorites) though all of the text is there. That fact really reduces this collection's value in my opinion, especially because Keats was such a thoughtful illustrator and each picture matches with the text to evoke a much stronger meaning than words or picture alone. It's still a great book though and nice to have in the classroom or at home. If you had to choose between owning each of the originals and this collection though, go with the originals."
1,Not happy,"I will honestly say I am rarely disappointed with my Amazon purchases. Today is the day: the book ""Keat's Neighborhood"" came with a torn dust cover ( torn in three places). This is totally unacceptable and needs to be replaced."
3,Not on 2 discs; No menu,"The description for this item says the 4 programs are on two discs, however it is not. The package I received was a new, unopened package. On the outside of the package is says ""on 2 discs"", but there was only 1 disc in the package. All of the advertised programs are on the one disc, but there is no menu; all programs run back-to-back so you have to fast-forward or skip-to-a-scene to find the individual programs. What a pain! I don't mind that all programs are on one disc. The fact that the disc has no menu system is what I don't like. The content of the programs are okay and what I expected."
1,Same on you,product does not work with current software. Need Windows 98 and earlier. Vender did not state computer compatibility requirements... Same on you. Vender / Customer relationships are based on trust. None disclosure is the same as not telling the truth.
2,Noisy,"Looks great --- sounds awful. Installed 3 of them and entire house buzzes when all 3 are on. Other existing ceiling fans are silent in the house by comparison. Regret the purchase. Nice hanging sculpture as it stands.UPDATE: After 2 years, I'm replacing them one by one. The buzz is awful."
3,Good Start,"This book is a good start for running a campaign for election. It strongly emphasizes the work required to succeed. It isn't easy running for election and the point is made strongly.As far as running a campaign based on the information presented, it is helpful especially if you've never run before."
3,How To Run,"How To Run would most likely help an aspiring politician and I may yet reference it for a friend's campaign however, the format makes it very difficult to read and the layout is confusing. The author also repeats himself quite a bit. The book is not very interesting nor is it easy to read but, if you want a book the you can reference occasionally this will suit you just fine."
2,From a UK angle,Although simply written this book is not that useful from a UK perspective - many of the things the candidate can do in the US you just cannot do here. Some of the points are useful - on fundraising or targeting voters in general. Not a great buy for a British reader and obviously a gap for a similar book here !
4,Great Album,"This album is awesome, but if you have never heard the gimme gimmes before, I'd suggest one of there other cd's to you. It's hard to understand their obscure sense of humor on this album if you are not a true fan. The DVD is awesome. I love watching everyone covering their ears. Best songs on this album are ""the longest time"" ""come sail away"" and ""strawberry fields forever"""
4,Definite Buy,"If you like Me First and the Gimme Gimme's brand of rocked up cover songs, then you will like this album. It's a good sounding live recording complete with screw ups and the usual humurous inbetween song banter. A couple of the song selections aren't that great but I enjoy most of them. I'd rate it a definite buy if you dig the Gimme's."
5,This is the best band in the world...,"Correction, the best COVER band in the world! And they have dozens of fans too. I bought this right before my last Hawaiian vacation and it was so soothing I could not stop listening to it on the beach. The boys are a real time saver --you can hear an hours worth of fine tunes in a half hour when they are played in double time thrash! Who'd a thought Bonnie Bramlett (Superstar) wrote such fine punk lyrics? And since it is live they miss a few notes and that actually gives you MORE notes... which is like getting more value...?As to whether or not its a real Bar Mitzvah? Just look at the faces of the older guests on the bonus video when they fire up the amps. I doubt they were acting.I love this disc."
2,read items carefully!!!!,"So i typed in the search that i wanted this cd so i could listen to it on my ipod. the company was called importcds, and plus, what current bands release records??! anyway, when i went to the post office (thats right, they didnt come to my door) i found a vinyl waiting for me. I was disapointed, but i guess it is my fault for not double checking.otherwise, price was cheap and service was pretty quick...guess im gonna buy a record player! Read stuff carefully!!!"
3,Eh,"Another reviewer said:""It was actually recorded at some kids Bar Mitzvah.""Ah, no. It actually wasn't.But anyway, if you're a fan pick this up. If you're not, get it only after you have the other four. And if you have a brain, don't believe Fat Mike and his ignorant political gibberish."
1,"haha, very funny...","so, the thing with this record is... it's just not funny. I like a lot of Me First songs, even the imperfections in some songs (like the 'i know, i know...' part in 'ain't no sunshine'), but here it's just annoying.The idea for the record is that Me First are playing live at a bar mitzvah, and that they're not very good. so they screw up in half the songs, and make a lot of jokes and remarks about eachother's playing capabilities.ofcourse it's part of the idea that the songs aren't too good, they're not supposed to put on a good show here. but i think it's kind of cheap to make a full-price CD of this thing.OK, it made me smile a couple of times, but i'm not buying this record. if you're a fan and want to have all of their records, or you've got just too much money, then go and get it, but the whole thing will get old really quickly, and you're probably not going to listen to it a lot."
2,skip it,"I'm usually pretty easy to please when it comes to this type of book, but only one of the three stories (Midnight Madness) was even close to being worth the read. The women in these stories were just awful. Their petulance was so off-putting to me, I just could not like them. Talk about moody, self absorbed brats. The governor was the only character I found endearing. The stories just didn't hold up well enough considering the unlikable heroines."
4,A good watch.,"I ride horses, track wildlife, and enjoy a good western, so this movie caught my eye. It's not a blockbuster, but it's a good watch. The limited tracking in it is at least somewhat realistic, unlike so many movies, and the country is beautiful. But it's the relationship between the two men that is so well done. This is worth watching."
2,seemed unfinished,The movie appeared to be a made for TV movie...story line was good but it seemed like it finished mid-movie. Did not like the ending at all
4,Better value than the UK Blu-ray,This is a good transfer with subtitles and is only marginally lower picture quality thatn the UK released Blu-ray that has no subtitles. The colonial accents make subtitles very helpful and the New Zealand scenery is brilliant. This is as good as the Australian film of the same name on a similar subject. Hopefully both will appear on US Blu-ray with subtitles in due course. This is the best available release at the present time.
4,Great movie,"Needless to say,I was very surprised by this movie...It looked like a western, which my Husband loves, so I picked it up...although it was set in the Australian Outback, it could very well be set in the old American west. The title of the movie says it all. An aborigine is falsely accused of murder and he runs knowing he will not be believed. He and the Tracker have more in common that the Tracker has with the men that hired him.. There are light moments as well as the more serious aspect to it. It also had a surprise ending which made the entire movie worth watching. The actors were great although I only recognized one and he will be remembered from the last Indiana Jones movie...It is a great family movie and should be watched just for the history lesson. Well worth the time to see and watch."
2,Not what I expected,So so movie. You always take a chance with foreign movies. Actors were not top notch and the production was so so.
4,"Teddy R , President and Outdoors man",I learnd alot about his ability to get things done regardless of politics and nay sayers. He saved our great wilderness and shot every thing in site ( joke ).
2,The Cover Is Infinitely Better Than The Story,"The novel has great cover art that actually illustrates a key scene from the book and the basic idea of the book is a great one. Basically a group of Americans holed up ina type of futuristic bomb shelter for six centuries while the world above them changes dramatically.But the story is let down badly from some of the truly hoky science that is used to push the plot forward. And the entire ""U.S. military is composed of bad people"" seems more from the immediate post Vietnam War era than from the late 1990s when the book was published.An interesting concept looking for a good story and good execution."
3,Disppointment on how the exanpsion map turn out to be,"A bit disppointed on how the exanpsion map turn out to be. It is actually stickers that you need to stick onto your boardgame. And because the board has a split in between, you have to cut the exanpsion map sticker inorder for you to keep the main map. It will be good if they have come in card board form and we can remove ot if we are playing for 4 or place it if you are palying for 6."
5,A GREAT TOY.,"Hi my name is Matthew.First off, I didn't order the toy online,I got it at Toys r us. I think it's a good toy.Its well put together and doesn't have too many stickers to put on it.The missiles shoot very well and the platform drops perfectly.Over all, it's a good ship."
3,Amazon is not packaging this product correctly,"I agree with the other reviewers about the extremely poor packaging by Amazon. Mine was shipped UPS in a bag, no protective shipping box at all. The product box was beat up, smashed in and bent all over. Very dissapointing that I had to send back a toy that I had been trying so hard to get due to shabby packaging."
1,Toys great! Amazon's Packaging Stinks Big Time,I was in shock when my Republic Gunship arrived without being packed in a second box to protect it. Amazon put the shipping label right on the box of the ship. It was not even packed in another box to protect it. If you want the actual box to be in good condition don't buy it from Amazon. My box was destroyed and had holes poked in it. I don't know what is going on here but if you plan to open box and don't care about the packaging being in good shape get it at Amazon. I had heard horror stories about other peoples packaging experiences but never thought it would happen to me. Oddly enough my Arc 170 fighter was packed in another box very carefully and the shipping was the same for both.
3,Do not order From Amazon Toys!!!,I ordered the battleship from Amazon Toys R Us and received the package in very bad shape from the KY distributor. The package came in a plastic bag with no bubble wrap and no self contained box. They even used FED X which is one of the worst companies to use to ship anything!!! Please be warned don't buy anything from Amazon Toys. I lost money on shipping because it and you will too!
5,Hey mom - spend some quality time with the kids!,"My 10 year old son gave me this for Christmas and I thought it was cute. Then he sat down with me and read through every recipe and picked out the ones he wanted to try. We had such a good time TOGETHER reading and cooking and eating. AND, amazingly - everything has tasted great!We've already made Rikishi's Rump Roast, The Rock's Rock Bottom Pancakes, and Harcore Holly's Big Beefy Meatballs (""The sauce is already inside"" he told everybody exicitedly!). The meatballs are our favorite so far.So, thanks J.R. for helping me spend some quality time with my son - not what you'd expect from the WWF, but worth every cent."
3,J.R.'s BBQ sauce Finnally,"After hearing him promote his BBQ sauce for months now, I had to order this book to get the chance to try making it."
1,More WWF Marketing Mania,"I cannot believe the garbage that gets published these days. The WWF Marketing Machine is selling a cookbook. The Junkyard Dog would be turning over in his grave if he knew about this. It's a fad people, it'll pass."
3,Not perfect but acceptable,"The product came with two defective KVM cables (mouse terminations were bad). I notified IOGEAR regarding this but they have ignored me...no replacements have arrived nor has IOGEAR indicated that they would replace the defective cables. On-line support leaves much to be desired....I found it difficult to get them off script to actually think about what I was reporting (had to do with hot key selection of ports). Outside of these issues, the product works great. The on-screen port selection makes it easy to switch from one computer to another with a couple of key strokes. Setup was trivial. I currently have 5 machines running from this switch (4 workstations and a laptop) and have 3 remaining ports for future expansion."
2,Junk! dont waste your money.,"just bought the 6# test.spooled up my reel and went to hit the lake. turns out this line has so much memory, it wouldnt cast more than 15 feet. line twisted all over the place. i even respooled 3 times thinking i could get the memory out but same thing every time.seems pretty tough no doubt but definatly not worth the hassle.fine your self some decent berkley dont look here"
3,If a site tells you that PC3200 will work for PC2700 don't believe them!!!!,"I used Crucial.com's scan feature to scan my computer and make sure I was getting the right modules. They recommended PC3200 over my current PC2700 and it looked like a good upgrade - boy was I wrong.Memory Type: DDR PC3200, DDR PC2700, DDR (non-ECC), 200 pin, SoDimmMaximum Memory: 2GBCurrently Installed Memory: 1GBWell, I can tell you that PC3200 won't fit! The notch is just slightly off so that it doesn't install. I had to send it back for a refund and buy PC2700 which I'm currently waiting for. Lots of time spent just trying to double my memory."
5,"The best album of 2001! Yes, really!","In my humble opinion, goldenwest is the best album nobody heard in 2001. If you enjoyed albums like The Soft Bulletin by The Flaming Lips, or O K Computer by radiohead, then do yourself a favor and buy goldenwest now.goldenwest has layer upon layer of pure sonic heaven. Really, there isn't much more that I could expect from an album. I'd also place goldenwest up there with Loveless by My Bloody Valentine. If you like your music to be thoughtful, yet thought provoking; buy goldenwest now while it is still in print!"
3,Hopefully the third Timecop won't be the last...,"It helps to read the first two books in this series, but it is not necessary. Dan Parkinson is great at writing books that link together, but can still be enjoyed individually. I hope that this series continues in a fourth book. This book (and series) is fun reading that is perfect for fans of time travel. Imagine jumping back in time on a mission, only to return to a different history- where you don't exist. Yikes!"
3,Love and writing,"As a collector of correspondences and writer, this is a fine collection of letters (between 3 people at times). Not that there is profound, or glorious, or poetic dialogue in the letters, but the special relationship between Valdimir and Lili surfaces as you read. Sometimes I wish they wrote more details. There is more going on in their lives then these letters frequently discuss. The book contains some reproductions of the actual letters. A nice enough collection of photographs included."
4,Well made sturdy sea creatures,"These are very well made sea creatures and my 3 year old grandson enjoys playing with them in the bath. The reason they have 4 stars instead of 5 is the colours are a little too strong to be completely realistic, and so do not look as attractive as they could otherwise be. My grandson especially enjoys taking up the water into them and squeezing it out, but also plays creatively with them. His favorites seem to be the turtle, the octopus, and the seal, probably because they fit the most neatly into his hands. The others area little bigger. It would be nice to have several of the same creature to buy individually rather than singles in each set, so they can be paired or grouped by a child or with several children. Would become expensive to buy several full sets."
4,Pretty good general information book,"If you are completely new to creating game art then this book is for you. However if you have read a few of these then you prolly wont get much out of it. It is definaly more of a Game are theory book. There is some good information in here on optimising things for their best performance. The book cover all areas not just characters and props but, level design as well.Still, Very well written. I even though I have read may of these I still found many parts of it very interesting."
4,As advertised,"No worries here. If you are looking for a part cleaning brush, this'll do. I do wish it was a bit softer though."
3,"It's okay, but does not dissolve to well, and is kinda chalky....","I tried using one scoop and blending it in a blender. However it did not blend very well and was kind of chalky. I will try using less than one scoop the next time. Also, it has a artificial after taste. I will say that it has the right amount of protein that I need."
2,Product Quality,This is the second mount that I purchased to hold my portable satelite radio. It is the second because the first one broke. Now that is only about a month old this one has broken too. Now I will find another product to replace it since I don't think another one will do any better. Cannot tighten the screw enough to keem the holder from rotating. Just as you get close enough to keep it from moving the piece breaks.
3,Almost perfect,Everything was ok except for the fact that the bible had another person's name engraved on it and the seller failed to mention that. I would have bought another one if that was the fact.
3,FreeCell Bicycle,"This Bicycle brand of FreeCell suffers by not being as handy as the original Radica version of FreeCell, but this Bicycle version is much better than the newer (2007?) Radica FreeCell, which is too large for pocket or purse, more difficult to hold than Bicycle while playing. Bicycle has betterr location of most-used buttons, and is generally easy to use. Neither the newer Radica nor the Bicycle FreeCell are as neat and esy to use as the original Radica."
1,Touch Screen FreeCell,"It is ""o.k."" not really thrilled with it. The screen is hard to see at times, depending how much light is in the area where you are playing. Second and most important the game is difficult to play as you cannot see all the cards. When I play the game on the Computer the cards are ALL displayed and makes the game easier to understand and ""read"" the cards"
3,FreeCell,This FreeCell was a replacement for a previous hand held model we had from Bicycle. This one is inferior to the previous model. A bit more difficult and harder to see. Very easy to end current game by accidentally striking for a new game.
1,Cheap Product,"It was a Christmas present. It worked 1 (ONE) day and then broke. The receiver threw the packaging away so there is no way to return it, even so. I am very disappointed."
1,Screen,Found the screen to be dark and had to hold in slant to see which is uncomfortable. So when laying down or sitting it is not easy to see the screen. I love to play but.... Also you can't see cards in upper level when you have 5 or 6 cards in row. Would not recommend this particular Free Cell card. Hardly play with it.
1,watch out off battery,I got this watch from amazon with the battery almost dead. I send a request to Amazon to exchange the watch but they told me that the watch was sold out and they can just return the money. I ask about if was posible change the battery with nike warranty. I never got an answer. Too bad Amazon...
1,monitor itself does not rotate like the demo video,"in the demo video the monitor rotates a vertical 360. I hurt both my hands trying to get the harness that connects to the monitor to do that. I love the idea of an affordable articulating arm for lcd monitors to free up deskspace and be able to freely move the monitor. the 7flex came close but no cigar. BIGGEST COMPLAINT: my monitor was crooked! I am sending it back tomorrow. My orginal monitor stand holds my flat panel perfectly level with my desk. I'm just glad I didn't break my monitor.OTHER COMPLAINT. I had to adjust the tension with an allan wrench. thats not safe. if you did buy this I would use it with a smaller monitor, maybe thats why it was crooked mine was too heavy. I have a 22in, but the sales rep said it would work making me even more dissapointed"
5,"""The Byrds"" Meet ""The Joy of Cooking""","This is the best CD that I have heard in a long time. It's great in every sense. The songs are outstanding: cleverly and meaningfully written; beautifully and sincerely sung; the accompanying music very well played, yet supporting the vocals, not overwhelming them. The production is quite good, a very crisp, warm sound. The opening tune, ""Follow me to Carthage,"" is haunting both sonically and in its word play. The author seems to have captured our times, not in a Phil Ochs sort of way (and god knows I loved Ochs) but more like how ""The Notorious Byrd Brothers"" or ""Closer to the Ground"" by the Joy of Cooking reflected their times. The rest of the songs are knock-outs too. There's no filler here. Although the music reflects late Bush's America, it transcends it. This is a work by artists that will be listened to and appreciated for its beauty, rather than its politics, for a long, long time."
2,Not as good as evolution,I am more fond of their earlier work. This is starting to dive into new sound territory and I like it less.
1,JUNK...JUNK...JUNK,"I was a dedicated Target fan but his ruined it for me. Ordered the first one, volume was either blasting loud or super soft. Still not unhappy, just thought it was a one in a million thing. Ordered a replacement. Guess what, volume didn't work on this one either. Still not unhappy. Decided it would be best just to get a refund and start all over on my search for a cd player."
1,JUNK JUNK JUNK,I got a GPX CD player for Christmas and it broke the 2nd time I used. TARGET wouldn't exchange it becuase I didn't have a receipt (It was a dang Christmas present!) I called GPX and they wanted me to ship the player back to them which cost $10 and mail them a check for $15. So it would cost me another $25 to replace it. GPX makes lousy products. You would have to be a FOOL to buy this product.
1,I thought it was just me...,"I ordered this as a Christmas gift for myself, but it was not worth it. I thought my volume control was the only messed up one, but I see other customers have the same complaint. I took it to the repair man, and he told me it would cheaper to buy another one instead of trying to get it fixed. I have used GPX before, but never again. This item is nice for decoration, but horrible for reliability. I have it sitting nice in my room, but never use it, because I am affraid it is going to blast my ears off. This stero is not worth it, invest your money elsewhere.!!!"
1,Stone-Age Sociology,"Don't waste your money or your time on this book. The author is still stuck in the now debunked and outdated ""Standard Social Science Model"" of human behavior. He sees only the ""nurture"" side of the ""nature vs. nurture"" debate and refuses to aknowledge the role nature (biology and evolution) plays. Current scientific evidence and documented cases have proven gender-associated behavior is primarily determined by biology, and that it is a mistake to try to ""socialize"" boys into more ""feminine"" behavior. (The majority of men in prison today come from fatherless, female-dominated households.) This male-bashing book, with a radical feminist perspective, only perpetuates the myth that we are all ""blank slates"" at birth and can be molded into whatever political/social correctness is in vogue at the time. I highly recommend Michael Gurian's, A Fine Young Man (1998) as an alternative choice."
5,Great Teaching Tool,"Clear consise and readable text on the Infancy Narratives of Matthew and Luke.A great review of ""The Birth of the Messiah""for use in the RCIA class."
1,Took too long to arrive,This book took weeks to arrive. My class was over before I received it. How long could it take to mail a very small thin book?
3,When FISH STICKS Attack !,"Starring: Tiffany,Paul Logan and Barry Williams.Written and Directed: Eric Forsberg.There is not going to be a description by this critic that equals this opus,LOL !The Killer Fish are a sight to beheld with fear !They are Huge and getting Bigger,Sharp Teeth that can eat Steel,Helicopters(more later) and Scenery.Helicopters,What is wrong with the Asylum ?,They must hate helicopters,Or have past bad Ju-Ju about being trapped by Volcano Ash in airports in Belize or why,Why pick on the poor helicopters...A necessary prop in most B-films since day one of drive-ins.Tiffany- OK sister you pulled this performance out of some orifice,Thanks.Paul Logan-So,Next time you'll have even more to do as you take over `The Expendable' job of Action Hero.Barry Williams aka Elder Greg Brady,You were stoic and just governmental enough to be beleivable...thanks from a OF,Original Fan !"
3,Way Over the Top; Poor Ending,"""Mega Piranha"" is a lot of fun to watch. Turn off your brain, relax, and just go with it. Super-macho hero? Check. Scene change or transition? Cue the ""Whoosh!"" sound effect. Surface-to-surface suicide piranha squad? Check. The whole movie is completely unrealistic, of course, but that is the whole point. Three stars for being fun and taking the piranha monster-movie genre to a new level.The characters are competent and believable enough for this movie. The piranha special effects are hilarious and effective. However, the ending is a let-down. A different, more complex ending requiring Tiffany's knowledge might have made this a four-star movie.Tiffany's song over the end credits is a nice touch. The ""Making of"" and ""Bloopers"" features add something to the whole package."
2,Cheesy,"This movie has cheap special effects and even worse dialogue and acting. Very silly and I wouldn't waste my money on it. If you like mindless entertainment, then this would work for you. Don't buy, but rental would be okay."
2,Mega Piranha... hahaha,"I don't want to just bash this movie... but let me start with something interesting:In the movie there was a chasing theme, of course ther is a chaing car and a car being chased, The chasing car is a black Chevy Tahoe, wiat, the next time you see it is a black Suzuki Grand Vitara.... the car being chased is a gold Toyota Camry, but wait, it's now a Hyundai Elantra... WTF? I am not a movie guy but I know cars, how the hack did the director think this is going to work? This says alot about this movie.FAIL."
1,Disaster Indeed,"Possibly the dumbest movie I've ever seen. The acting, directing, special effects and storyline wouldn't have cut it in a 70s porn movie."
3,Solid bit of goofiness,"Does what it says on the tin: provides gigantic piranhas attacking people, ships, and even buildings and aircraft. Paul Logan isn't my idea of a great leading man, but he isn't ridiculous. Tiffany was fun to see and a better actor than Debra Gibson in ""Mega Shark vs Giant Octopus"" (I want one of these ""vs"" movies to be a courtroom drama). Barry Williams has much less to do than I'd hoped, but overall the action satisfies, wrapped neatly in a completely ludicrous story that relies hilariously on a lot of scratchpad calculations of the danger. It's no 2010: Moby Dick, but it'll do for a $5 Blu-ray from the bargain bin."
1,Mega Merde,"This looked like it would be a fun movie to watch, but nope, it's horrendously, horrendously awful.The acting was horrible, the writing was even worse, the computer projections were extremely disagreeable. The film's only real redeeming was a big bob shot at the start.Mega Piranha is 90 minutes too long and quite possibly one of the worst films I have ever seen. I have a sense of humor, I love bad movies but this one was just plain unacceptable.The amount of head butts to my pillow I did that night doesn't make possible for me to recollect any more than that."
1,Buy this title from Wal-mart for $5.00,This movie is listed for about $14.99 on Amazon but can be bought from Wal-Mart for aprox $5.00.This is a sub-standard movie with cheesy acting and Pirnaha that are about 20 feet long when they grow to maximum size.This movie should sell in the price ranges of $1.99-$5.00.Purchase the original Piranha movie that was made in 1978 to get your moneys worth.The fish in that movie were actually close to the size of a real Pirnaha and the acting was not too terrible.I bought this movie off of ebay for about $20 but will wait for future titles to be sold in Wal-Mart for about 1/3 of the price.There are alot of newer movies coming out now being sold for about $20 but can be bought for alot cheaper with the passing of time and patience.
1,Atomic clock,I ordered the Atomic Clock and it will not set to the correct time. I would return it but did not keep the paper work.
1,unhappy...but what can i do? nothin really. just change sites.,it was scratched up pretty bad and there was acid damage in the battery compartment. i figured used was gonna be cheaper but at what cost. by the time i paid shipping it wasnt worth it.
2,hard to see display,"The lcd viewing angle is very poor. When looking at it straight on, the display is almost impossible to read, and when looking from below, the display becomes fuzzy. The only time it is perfectly sharp is when looking at it from above. The light is dimmer that I think it should be and does not help the viewing angle problem. The alarm noise seems to be enough to wake me up, but it may not be loud enough if you are a heavy sleeper."
2,"Good for keeping time, cr** for waking up","If this clock performed its alarm function as well as it performs its atomic timekeeping function, it would have been a great purchase. But it has a soft alarm, which turns itself off when the time changes over to the next minute. And there's no automatic snooze. I ended up sleeping through it 100% of the time. Sadly, I couldn't return it, but at least here I can voice my dissatisfaction."
2,Storybook classics,"Not the best of Hanna-Barbera's work, but it gives a pleasant retelling of these classic stories.HB had previously done Gulliver 10 years earlier, as ""The Adventures of Young Gulliver.""Warner may release that in time too, but check these classics out in the meantime.They're good innocent stories for your kids."
5,Interesting Interpretations,"This is the kind of book that makes you think; sure, some of the conclusions are far fetched, but at least Jim Cullen offers an interesting and original perspective. Cullen firmly places Springsteen in an American tradition; puts the man and his music in a broader perspective, and he does this convincingly. The book is obviously a continuation of the article on Springsteen he published before, read this first. To say that his comparisons and his analyses are tenuous is easy; you really need to read the book carefully to be able to appreciate Cullen's interpretations, that is what they are, interpretations. Cullen doesn't seem to pretend otherwise and rightfully so because the assumptions he makes cannot be empirically proven, they don't have to be, art cannot be dissected mathematically. Therefore, if you are a more experienced reader, preferably in academic writings, AND a fan of Bruce Springsteen, this book is food for thought and well worth the money."
2,Overblown analysis of Springsteen's work,"This book seems like a college term paper extended to book length. Although the central theme is Springsteen's work, the book seems to almost wander randomly around American history and culture. The author stretches credibility when he compares Springsteen to Jefferson, Lincoln, Whitman, etc. I am a huge fan of Springsteen, but Jim Cullen seems to have lost any objectivity in presenting his thesis on the subject."
1,"76 garbage condoms, 24 good ones","Item description is misleading. It doesn't include anything but condoms and both the variety & overall quality sucks.Here's what I got in my 100-pack:30 Trustex Non-lubricated (very cheap condoms. 30 no lube? Trustex?)12 Trustex Lubricated12 Trustex Lubricated with spermicide20 Unlabeled Lubricated (most expire in a few months, no manufacture label, look super cheap!! these are all going in the trash!!)6 Trojan Ultra Pleasure with spermicide6 Trojan Lubricated (standard trojan, nothing special)6 Beyond Seven Sheerlon Latex with ALOE lubricant (Nice!!)2 Atlas Non Lubricated (these look like something you'd find in a sex dungeon)2 Durex Natural Feeling2 LifeStyles Snugger fit (penis chokers!)1 ONE adrenaline rush1 ONE pleasure plus (this one looks interesting)"
3,"Cute, clever sheets, light blanket","I have the Zanzibar valances and lamp in my son's room so I was excited to recieve this bedding. I live in Michigan and our winters are cold. I was hoping the comforter blanket would have been thicker and warmer. It is a thin fleece blanket with a cute design. Great for fall and spring, but I question if it is warm enough for winter. The sheet is clever. It is fitted on one side so that it cannot ride up or be kicked off. I like that given I often have to tuck my 2 year old in again after he falls asleep. The design does have a lot going on but it is cute for a little one."
5,A Must Have Documentary,"Fascinating stuff, extremely well edited and fast paced, science at its best, recommend to anyone who loves documentaries.Will buy more from PBS, what a great service PBS offers."
5,Becoming Human,"Fantastic! This is a must see for everyone of all ages. If you ever wanted to know about our human origins, then you will find this documentary one of the best yet."
3,Good historical context but nothing new.,"Simons is very critical of the Bush & Clinton Administrations, as well as Arab dictatorships. He exposes much of the hypocrisy of western Realpolitik as applied to the Gulf. But is it really a surprise that big powers have selfish interests? Simons gives an excellent historical context but is weak on current trends and economics. He offered little productive insight or proposals to resolve the situation. I hoped for more commentary from the normally insightful Tony Benn in his too-brief introduction."
5,A Wonderful Enchantment filled book!,This is one of my favotire books because it's filled with excitement. I recommend Aladdin for children who are adventurous and love happily ever after endings. In the book it tells about genies and magical treasures. This book will take you on an exciting journey that you will never forget!
3,Didn't grab my attention,"Not even close to the quality of their album Writer's block, but probably ok for huge PBJ fans."
5,Best book I've read in years - written by a true hero,"It was fascinating to me to be taken right there where Michael was. He did an excellent job of putting the reader in his place, feeling his pain, seeing what he saw. ""Seeing"" his experiences gives a totally new perspective to what happened in Somalia. Having the character to tell Bill Clinton ""NO"" is quite admirable. I thoroughly enjoyed this book. Great job, Michael and you make me more proud (if that's possible) to be an American."
5,What an inside view!,"Michael Durant's story is not only courageous and humble at the same time, but it gave me a GREAT inside look at what many of our service men and women go through. It is an easy read although without a military background some of the code names or nicknames went over my head. Durant does a great job at explaining things though. I absolutely recommend this book to anyone!! Thank you to all those who serve. You are amazing!!"
5,Amazing Story,This is an amazing story from start to finish. I honestly could not put it down. This book and Blackhawk Down should sit side by side in you bookcase. Blackhawk Down only briefly summarizes what Michael Durant went through in Somalia. This is a great uplifting biography of his career as a military pilot and honors the heroes that make the ultimate sacrifice to defend us when called to duty.
5,The real story,"We all remember the images of Michael Durant as he was held captive for 11 days in Somalia. This book tells the real story behind the pictures and the unbelievable odds Michael Durant had to overcome just to survive. He also has the guts to rip the Clinton administration for turning its back on the boys in the battlefield, something Blackhawk Down sort of danced around. It's certainly a page-turner."
5,For all the patriots.,"I, like others mentioned before, have waited for CWO4 Michael Durants memoirs about those days in Somalia. Very well written, highly recommended.Thank you CWO4 Durant for your honesty and obviously painful recollection of those days. You are a true patriot. Your words are an inspiration to all of us."
4,explodes then fizzles,"most of the book is very gripping when it replayed the forage into mogadishu, the battle, the subsequent capture and survival stages. in the latler parts of the book, it starts to amble and meander more often into boring side stories. some of these serve as background in the context of the book and characters, but others are pointless. frankly, durant's (side)stories arent that interesting and/or hartov isnt that great of a storyteller.5* for first half3* for second half"
4,Above and beyond almost everything,"The story of the US helicopter pilot captured in Mogadishu, Somalia which corresponded with the story of Black Hawk Down. This is a taut gripping real life story of special ops, top gun flyers and life among the elite of the US Armed Forces. Durant was seriously injured when his helio was shot down. He endured incredible pain, and expected the worst. He received surprising care from some Somalis and eventually was released as a gesture from the warlord , Mohamed Aidid. If you are curious to live the life of these elite forces and the view of being captured by a young hard nosed military type you will like this book. I liked his quote from Colin Powell, "" The people in the front lines are right and those in the rear are wrong."" Durant's observations of the Clinton approach to this war are totally in line with those expressed in the Bin Laden book."
4,A good read,"The descriptions the writer's encounters were very well written. One could only imagine what our soldiers go through--the sacrifices, brotherhood, etc."
1,Skeptical,"I was anxious to read Durrant's personal account flying over theMogadishu fire-fight scene. It should have reflected the sober andarticulate demeanor of a combat pilot who shuttles dozens ofsoldiers to very dangerous areas on Earth. Instead, the book wasriddled with Hollywood cliches and highly inaccurate statements. Ihave been involved with Naval aviation since 1976. I have workedin and on the A6, P3 and H60 and NONE of these aircraft have aouter skin of steel or is their construction primarily made of steel. Ihad to put the book down after reading these statements made bya commisioned officer possesing at least 10 years in the H60. Ifyou desire this book, don't pay more than $2.00 (includingshipping)."
3,Excellent book for the mililtary enthusiast,"This is an excellent of Michael J. Durant's experience in the ""Mog"". Durant also describes his personal account as a POW and as a helocopter pilot. The book gets you in the mindset of Durant as he explains what it is like to be a POW, his hopes and fears. The book does contain chapters on Durant's military career that has nothing to do with with Somalia, but an interesting read none the less."
5,My questions have been answered.,"After seeing Blackhawk Down, I had always wondered about what happened to Michael Durant after he was captured. This book told every last detail of his captivity including many intermitant chapters about his background and career with the Night Stalkers - SOAR Special Ops Helicopter group. Including training/bootcamp, missions in Panama, the Gulf War and so on.Very compelling book. The descriptions of the atmospheres, emotions and pain of his ordeal in captivity are vivid and captivating. I read this book straight through in 2 sittings. Very compelling. A must read for any enthusiast of military, war, government and personal trials and tribulations fans.Get it."
4,Quite satisfied,"I currently have three of these in use, each one in a separate bluebird house. They provide quality video and sounds. I can even hear people talking when in the yard in the vicinity of the birdhouse. It is very entertaining to watch the birds build their nest, hatch their eggs and raise their young ones."
3,good camera,good camera could see very clear in the day and a Wide range could hear very good when someone talking i use mine outside for the price you can't beat. the only thing you could only see about 20-25 feet in the night need to have some kind of light to see good
1,"I like the color in the picture, BUT","I like the color in the picture, BUT the color I got was ugly. The top doesn't even look like wood at all. And it's super dark."
5,Like Buttah!!,This is seriously delicious fun. I have baked my whole life and have never been more impressed with the taste and the look of what I created. I was impressed by the easy to follow directions and very helpful step by step pictures. In some cases I only needed a half or one third of the recipe and it all worked out fine. Stop reading reviews and buy the book already.
5,Had to have it,"Since I already own an extensive collection of cookbooks, I usually just take a new one out at the library to enjoy now and then. After checking this out 3 times - I knew it was one I wanted to own. Her techniques and ideas for decorating cakes are fresh and fun. Both my grandsons couldn't wait to try them and when I adapted her technique for three dimensional butterflies out of white chocolate ""melts"" I was hooked. The recipes are easy, clear and can be adjusted to your own taste. A winner."
4,Unbelievably Tasty!,"The cake and frosting recipes are delicious! You really can make a fun, decorative cake that catches attention -- but tastes fantastic too! I've done a lot of decorating that I was proud of the look, but almost embarrassed for people to eat. Not with this book! Even if you don't want/need to create a decorative cake, buy this book just for the recipes!That being said, I only gave the book 4 stars because it is certainly not intended for the beginner. And I don't just mean the beginner decorator, but even the beginner baker. While the recipes are easier than they first appear, they do still require a pretty well-equipped kitchen. For instance, I was very glad to have a stand mixer when making Kaye's butter cream recipe which requires 15+ minutes of mixing!Also, it seems that most of the decorating involves making things with melted chocolate wafers and adding it to the cake, rather than what I consider ""traditional"" cake decorating like borders, flowers, etc. But still worth it!"
2,Not as good as it looks,"This book is not all that great. They spend more time on all the chocolate decorations to put on the cake, than on the actual cakes. Most of the cakes are covered in these chocolate designs, not much instruction on actual cake decorating. I am a very experienced cake decorator and I was extremely disappointed with this book. Don't waste your money!"
2,Not want I expected,"From the other reviews I read about this book, this book is not what I thought it would be."
1,Dreamsecle,This books is nothing like the cover!! I was very disappointed! I thought it would be full of fun cakes and boy was I suprised!
5,"Love, Love, Love this book!!!","Before I bought this book, I thought the way I made my buttercream was the best. Once I tried their house buttercream, I was immediately hooked. Even the chocolate stars decorations were easy to make but very impressive on the cakes I made. I kept getting all kinds of compliments on the way I used the wafer chocolates in various colors on my cakes, and I have been a HUGE fan of The Whimsical Bakehouse book ever since. It's definitely my most-used cake book."
5,great book,"this book not only offers great recipes, it gives you step by step directions on how to decorate and put a cake together correctly.I love this book- it has become one of my favorites."
5,Fun! Fun! Fun!,What a wonderful book! If you enjoy cake decorating this is a fun book to have. The recipes are different than others I have found. I can't wait to make them all!
4,Cool recipes and techniques,"I bought this book based on the good reviews. I took a Wilton cake decorating class 17 years ago. I hadn't decorated a cake for years and started having interest again. I was mainly looking for recipes for good tasting frostings that I could color and frost cakes with. There are many recipes for frostings and cakes. I hadn't tried them yet but can't wait. The cake examples are very bright colors like the one on the cover. The colors are a bit too bright for my own taste, but I think kids would love them. The technique for making decorations out of chocolate are very cool. They look complicated, but the process is actually simple. I wished that there were pictures for each cake, though. This is a very good book to have as your cake decorating and recipe resource."
4,Good book,"I needed to get past the colors,This is a good book for those of you that are into chocolate."
5,Parents loved them,Item was purchased as a gift. Parents loved them! The stools are holding up great and look fabulous with their other bar items.
5,Great stools for kids and adults,"These stools look great, are sturdy enough for children to climb up onto without tipping and have the swivel seat. The leather seat is easy to wipe off. Great stools for the price and easy to assemble."
2,Screws stripped & not 30 inches as it states,"This stool looks very nice and easy to put together. It does say 30 inches, and it is actually 29 inches (as the other similar products correctly describe). After about 3 weeks, the screws fell out of the bottom and are now stripped. It was not over used and there is no reason for that to have happened. Now it sits in the garage taking up space."
5,Very nice looking stool.,"This stool is very sturdy, a great price, is very nice looking and was very easy to assemble. I got it for my 89 yr old dad who had an old one that was plain and rickety. He comments all the time on what a nice looking stool it is. The swivel mechanism is smooth and works very well."
2,"30"" Barstool - Box shows 29""","The barstools I ordered are to be 30"" high. The boxes that these came in are labeled as 29"".I haven't yet opened the boxes as I'm contemplating sending them back."
1,bad,"because i was told by several native belarussians that they could not understand a word i was saying, if not for my enlgish translation with it? so must be wrong somehow who knows ????! i am giving it away paranoid to use it now"
3,Life is too short for this...,"This is probably a good book, but it's just too damn long to merit the month of time it would take to plow through it. There are so MANY other good books out there to read that I gave up. Granted, there were some flashes of wit in the first 25 pages, but they were buried in gibberish. Sorry. I quit and returned it to the library."
5,THE BOOK,"This is not so much a review of Inifinite Jest or David Foster Wallace's unquestionable talent. This is a review of people who claimed that the book was sterile, long-winded, pointless, ""a joke in itself"". I suggest you finish reading ""Peter and Jane Go To The Beach"" or get your IQs tested. I understand that, for some people, books that exceed 25 pages are difficult and if there are more than two characters, things really get tricky. Could you please stop polluting this space with your pointless and pseudo-intellectual critiques. Long live DFW!"
1,Incredible Disappointment,"Comparing Wallace to Pynchon is like comparing a kettle of sponges to Disney World. One is pointless inanity, and the other is entertaining and interesting.I tried, very hard, to like this book...I tried for years. I finally broke down and read analyses of his writing, critiques and speculation about the meaning of the writing... ...and it appears that he is that guy in the college coffee shop, scribbling in his diary because ""no one understands the profound truth and emotion that he has discovered."" I get it. I just really don't care. There are plenty of those people who do appreciate DFW...and I likely wouldn't be able to stand those people.If you want 'highbrow reading with menaning' Read Kafka or Sartre for more prosaic insight into the human condition, or Dostoyevsky for a better narrative. If you want intellectually elitist literature, read Foucault's Pendulum. If you want to be warm, burn your overrated copy of Infinite Jest."
2,This is one nude regent!,"Perfect marketing: I fell for the ""challenge"" Infinite Jest was presented as; also, I happened to have read Wallace's essays in Harper's and loved those.IJ shows that what's great in small doses is terrible in large ones, and IJ revealed exactly what someone mentioned earlier: ""Too many words, too little story.""People seem so brow-beaten by the vocabulary and pharmaceutical jargon that they are left too cowed to step back and deem the book a monumental stylistic exercise with no character development or emotional depth.Read his collection of essays, have a good laugh, and stay way from IJ."
2,More than Most Readers Want to Know about Addiction,"This novel is hypnotic, like the addictive worlds which most of its characters inhabit. Those at the tennis school are addicted to success; those in the halfway house are addicts of a different sort. Infinite Jest consumed a week of evenings, then came to a depressing, but hardly surprising conclusion. The author is quite talented; he created a memorable character in Gately, the halfway house manager. I stuck with this mainly to see what would happen to him at the end."
4,A book! A novel! Of such quality that it has been published!,"This book is almost as amusing as the people who try totell you how to read it. As an aid to the layman, I shallsummarize their position: ""Infinite Jest"" is a masterpiece of prose, an aria of imagination. It stands on its own, defying criticism...unless, that is, you have readthe novel and intend to criticize it, in which case you should be referred to the works of Gaddis and Pynchon,who are even more famous than David Foster Wallace and often just as unfunny. Foster Wallace's writing evokes an infectious love of language. However, if you don't like his diction, keep in mind that he was initially writing for a very small audience (his aunt and the ghost of Nabokov).All in all, the book is great, but not for everybody; if it is not for you, it is above you. But buy it, anyway."
3,Wallace is Clever,"... a fact that is confirmed by the amount of time Wallace has apparently dedicated to proving that point. I wouldn't so much call this book a novel as I would call it an essay disguised as one. It is generally quite difficult to empathize with the characters in the book when most of them are used as vehicles for Wallace's observations. This book is extraordinarily self indulgent. I could not finish reading this book without getting the feeling that its aim was to entertain its author more so than its reader. This is not necessarily bad. Wallace's observations (largely focused on domestic and drug abuse) are often witty and insightful. However, for over one thousand pages of dense reading, I was hoping for more ""jest""."
2,Not worth the slog,"I made it to page 800 before I decided I was sick of this book. He's brilliant, yeah, and he never lets you forget it -- but God, he just goes on. I found the tennis academy sections borderline unreadable, and for the last 300 pages or so before stopping I was so tired of how every character needs some grotesque quirk, some ridiculous deformity or absurd method of ""demapping"" her/himself. (I like that term, though.) I just wanted him to stop the circus for a while and follow some of the absurdity through, develop a few points. He does that in a few places, especially with Gately in the halfway house, and in those moments he manages to be funny, mind-boggling, and moving all at once. But ultimately it's just not worth the slog. His essays are terrific, and I like what I've read of his short fiction. In those genres he gets the same basic points across that he's dealing with in Infinite Jest, but without the piles and piles of chaff."
2,Disappointment...,"First off let me say that I didn't finish the book, but I had high hopes of enjoying this read--even anticipated setting aside time in a busy life to accomplish that which many posters have claimed is near impossible, a complete reading of Infinite Jest. I read for pleasure and prefer books that offer ""enlightenment"" or fresh perspectives of social/psychological issues. The narrative just never seemed to get off the ground. Should I have persevered and given it another chance? Probably, but there are too many other books I am compelled to read. I really wanted to enjoy this after reading many positive, albeit cautious, reviews. It is the first Wallace that I have attempted, but I found this both ponderous and pretentious. Was he a good writer? Certainly! Do I want to sacrifice the time and effort to appreciate his exhausting prose----maybe later..."
5,A 3-Pound Giant,"What can I say about an obscenely massive yet undeniably great novel? I think I just said it. Wallace is certainly a great writer (an understatement) and he knows it. Some of the sequences in this novel--the Eschaton game, the murder of the Antitois, Gately going medieval--are among the best sustained samples of narrative force I have read. However, as expected from such a massive novel, not everything works. All the characters are delightfully idiosyncratic but some of them are extraneous; they only serve to show off Wallace's way with characters. Yet I was enthralled by ""Infinite Jest."" The novel should have showed up on the list of the 100 best works of fiction this century."
3,A tad much,"What kind of ego must one have to alter the form of the novel that has worked for,gosh,a few centuries now to accommodate his own footnote fetish. This gets old real quick in Infinite Jest. I'm sure there is quality here but I got tired of watching the author show off. Length,bulk and dense writing can be O.K.,but must be backed up with substance.As Lloyd Bentson might have put it ""I knew Thomas Pynchon, I've read Thomas Pynchon - and Mr. Wallace you're no Thomas Pynchon."""
2,only the patient need apply,"After all the hype surrounding this book I thought I'd give it a try. The premise of this novel is interesting, but it takes far too long to get to the meat of the matter. The author spends an enormous amount of time building-up characters before he lets us know how they relate to one another as well as how they relate to the basic story. This book should only be read by readers who are very patient and are willing to invest a great deal of time getting to the heart of the novel"
2,Kindle: Poor first impression,"I'm reading my first Kindle book, David Foster Wallace's ""Infinite Jest"" -- not an easy book, to be sure, but an excellent book to read on the Kindle: It's a huge, heavy block in regular print form, and the Kindle is light and small. However (and I don't know if this is typical because it's my first Kindle book), there are *so* many typos, this reminds me of some pretty bad software I used many years ago that would scan text from a print document and then supposedly translate it to computer-readable form. This software sorta worked, but it was messy, often inaccurate, and required lots of by-hand editing. Is this how Kindle editions are being created? If so, the software's still pretty bad, and it's really not a lot of fun to read a book with typos.Not a good first impression, Kindle. And Amazon charges not only for the typo-strewn books, but the device that allows us to read them?? I must be missing something here....."
2,Disappointed (not in the book but in the recording),This is such a great book written by a brilliant writer. Not including footnotes is a HUGE oversight. How can Audible claim this is an unabridged version? The disclaimer in the beginning advises the listener to follow with a written text. One of the reasons some of us are buying an audio version is that we don't have the time or opportunity to sit down with the paper version of the book.
2,"Too long, too self absorbed","David Wallace may have been a genius, but even geniuses need good editors. This 1000 page book needed a TEAM of editors. It is way too long and self involved a novel to be given anything more than a couple of stars.If you are interested in what all the fuss is about, be sure you know you will be reading it for a while, and may find it less frustrating to take it out of your local library."
1,Better Than a Sleeping Pill,"Bought this to read with my book group. I guess I am just not smart enough to get this book. Some of the descriptions are hilarious, but the overall story - at least so far - is zzzzz. If I hadn't committed to reading it with my group, I wouldn't bother to finish it. I can tell he was a gifted writer, but I really shouldn't have to work this hard to enjoy the story."
1,"one day at a time, sweet jesus...","I felt I had to warn people about this book. If you like Pynchon, fine, go ahead, you'll like this. If you are looking for anything ""traditional"" like storyline, character development, images or descriptions that set the tap root a-tapping, forget it. A digression on a digression, detail where it is not needed, false direction, piss take academe... easy target after easy target. If you are the type that likes mental games, read Calvino, Borges......"
1,I guess I am not that smart....,"I tried, I really did! I am your average 30 year old who likes to think that they enjoy a range of novels from Harry Potter to Oprah's club to Bridget Jones type tales to David Sedaris...my favorite book (I Know this Much is True by Wally Lamb) was even this long! I barely made it through 150 pages of Infinite Jest...there is just too much to figure out! I didn't like so many characters (I would have just liked to hear about the one family), and I think that you need to be doctoral student in literature to unravel all of the language. I am not one to give up on books (I read The Corrections!) but I was starting to dread my nightly reading times thinking about returning to this maze of a book! No offense to the author's triumph...I guess I am not that smart!"
3,Not Ashamed Not to Love This Book,"I wanted to respond to ""a reader from San Diego."" Yes, there is much to recommend in David Foster Wallace's work. On the other hand, there are many reasons not to love it as well. I admire the chances Mr. Wallace takes with literature and his willingness to experiment and create a work that all rules of commercial publishing should say is completely unmarketable. However, my personal feeling is that his writing draws attention to itself more than is necessary. I prefer to be less aware of the author when I am reading. When reading Dostoyevski, for example, I do not get the sense that the author is showing off like Mariah Carey hitting a squeaky high note that is nearly at a level only dogs can hear. It is misguided to dismiss everyone who does not fall in love with this book as unintelligent or lazy."
4,challenging...but worth it...,"to the reviewer from San Diego who wrote....""I've been reading Wallace for 30 years..."" - what exactly were you reading 30 years ago? How old do you think that he is?"
5,Brain Aerobics,"Best book I ever read. My sides actually hurt from laughter after the Eschaton scene. Just remember: every seemingly digressive or irrelevant passage becomes very important to understanding the resolution of the story, although I didn't realize just how important until I re-read much of the book."
2,Too complicated for simple me,"While the story is interesting, the language is so complicated that I as a non-native English speaker has a problem getting into the flow of reading and therefore the book becomes somewhat a struggle to get through. I had to give up."
1,The Tyranny of the English Deparment!,"Oh Lord! I can't imagine a contraption this longwinded and show-offy. It's the tyranny of the English Deparment, footnotes and all! The author needs to be aired out. After reading this, I wanted to read a Zane Grey novel."
4,"Hard Work, But Big Pay-Offs","I won't lie. I found this book too long, too big, too messy and occasionally too hard to follow. Sometimes I even felt like I was being manipulated and messed with by the author. But the good parts were funny, effortlessly clever and fun to read. (Like the large section about things a person learns when he finds himself in a recovery facility.) The footnotes were ridiculous, and not in a good way. They didn't add to my experience as a reader. If anything, they detracted from it. Despite all that, I really like this book. Though it's hard to say why."
1,Too smart for your own good.,"There was a time when picking up a book made you feel that you would be whisked away to a fantasy world, entertained, moved, and satisfied. With this guy picking up a book means getting a hernia. If it is not 400k words, it must not be analyzed enough! I could not take it. It was written fine, the thing was long and boring enough to get the kudos of people that have spent their lives loving all the words of the world so much that every single one of them must be put in their book. Sure, he was making good points, for the 1990s! Argh, not my cup of tea. But remember, this guy won a freeking McAuthor genius grant.still like this story better, it is just more zany, funny, and dumbLife Begins..."
5,One of the best...,"Sadly, IJ will forever now remain as DFW's crowning piece of work. We'll always have to wonder how many more IJs and beyond he had in him.That said, this book is incomprehensibly fantastic. I'm not sure many, if any, could understand the full breadth of it. But, there is something here for every reader. Stephen Hawking, as well as your fourteen year old sister could read it and recognize part of their existence in it. That's part of its majesty.The real majesty is nothing more than Wallace, himself. His mind was a tormented, brilliant, colossal thing...and much of it is laid out for us here. A must read for everyone. Even if you don't finish the footnotes."
1,"enough, already","Over 1000 pages of pseudo-subersiveness. Skip it. DWF is desperately trying to emulate one of the century's greatest authors, and utterly fails. One star is too much. Sorry, DWF. Keep trying. Suggestion: lots of people have imitated Salinger, and have gotten away with it. Try something easier next time."
1,Last time I buy a book from my Kindle,This is the last time I buy a book from my Kindle as I was shocked when I saw the pricing on this after the fact. I absolutely refuse to pay more for the electronic version of a book than for a physical copy. I know this is the publisher's fault and not Amazon's so I will do my best to punish them by simply not buying their products. Lots of other stuff out there with more rational pricing and that is where I will direct my dollars. I encourage other Kindle owners to do the same.
3,Great book; arrived in shoddy condition,Of course this is an excellent book for anyone familiar with David Foster Wallace...my only gripe is that (like many other times) book arrived in the mail looking like it had been kicked around and stomped on before it got to my door. Book appears to be in far-from-new condition. This is a battle I have fought with Amazon many times (although I rolled the dice and ordered Genesis 1970-1975 and had to admit it was in excellent and new condition but only after I had sent an e-mail after ordering it to be sure it arrived in new and not beat-up condition).
1,don't read this book.,"if not the, then all-but-the saddest book I have ever read. challenging, involving, and horrifying. I read this book almost two years ago and sometimes I still laugh thinking about it and sometimes I still feel awful thinking about it. Don't read it."
1,"Mary, NY","easy to order, but I have not yet received it on my Kindly, and it's been weeks!!! I keep checking every day!"
1,Literary Excrement,The title of my review says it all...Don't even bother with this wannabe Pynchon.
1,Waste of space on the bookshelf.,This book is MISERY! I tried three times to start the book (each time with an open mind) and all three times i never made it to the end of chapter one. Another poster made the reference to mumbo jumbo and they were right. Just a bunch of irrelevant words to set the scene.... not to mention he described everything into painful detail. I should have read the reviews more carefully before I bought this literary nightmare.
5,"Brilliant, Fun, and Very Long","I'm not much of a book reader. But when a trusted friend loaned Infinite Jest to me, I knew I had to take the challenge. Eight months later, I turned the last page, and I swear, just the act of reading it has caused my comprehension, vocabulary, and reading speed to improve. If you like dark, twisted characters involved in a plot as twisted as life itself that never fails to make accurate commentary on the state of the world, this book is for you.Warning: This is no Tom Clancy, Micheal Crichton, or Stephen King. This is VERY heavy reading, and you must pay attention to every detail. Infinite Jest is not a mainstream novel; it's not for the squemish, the meek, or the casual reader. It is a work of art. And as has already been mentioned, you MUST read the footnotes. I used two bookmarks, one for the novel and one for the footnotes, which worked out pretty well.So dive in to Infinite Jest; and remember to come up for air once in a while!"
2,Infinite Geste: I quit 50 pages from the end,"yep, just lost interest in one thread after another, until there were no interesting threads left.also, most of his science & math were wrong, which i found even more distracting than the (in some cases already proven wrong) ""near-future"" stuff."
2,impossible to care about,"I gave up after a hundred pages. There is no question about the author's ability to write, or his quick mind, but I tired of reading about potheads years and years ago. There is now no more tedious subject in literature than drugs unless it is self-gratification. And in the early portions of this book the dope stories follow each other like penguins in a queue. Other material seems like Saturday Night Live skits gone haywire. One admires the craft here, but the author doesn't give the reader anyone or anything to care about."
5,not for everyone but....,"...one of the most interesting and creative works of fiction I have ever read....can promise you have never read anytihng like it...Some say is about the downsides of entertainment but much more pertinent re addiction....Long, but if you can get to page 55 or so you will not put it down....."
5,The Linchpin to Infinite Jest,"Having just finished Infinite Jest, I feel sad and warm and at peace all at the same time. For me this book is Wallace's expunging of his personal feelings about addiction, interpersonal interactions and human frailty.It's tough to pin down any one point to the end of this book. The overarching goal of the story itself hinges on this one point: Did Hal watch IJ or didn't he? If he didn't, then it makes a very particularly dark pall on things. IF he did, one could say that Himself was successful in getting Hal to finally feel.It took the power of IJ to break Hal out of his shell, which tells us how deep Hal was in his cocoon. That same power was way too strong for people with more normal levels of self-awareness. Poor Hal. James' final act was to save Hal and he did it. It's almost as if Hal is behaving like an infant trying to cope with this new, alien world.That's just one small look at this monumental novel. I loved it. I'm going to miss everyone."
2,"Too many words, too little story.","Wanted desperately to like it, but brevity, alas, remains the soul of wit"
4,Don't know if it was good or bad but couldn't stop.,"You can read the rest of the reviews for a discussion of theplot, characters, etc., but the way I read it best describesit. I used it as a soporific at night, and eventually got tothe point where like an addictive sleeping pill, I couldn'tskip a night without tossing and turning. I have eighty pagesto go, and I'm beginning to worry about what will happenwhen I have to go cold turkey. Maybe like an earlier reviwer,I'll have to maintain the addiction and read it again, lookingfor the seeds and stems."
1,Infinite Jest - the joke is on the reader,"I love reading, I love books, I love to play with words. This is the only book I have ever read where when I finished I wanted to hurl it across the room. I was furious. Self-indulgent, mental masturbation with no real point, tripe. The only good thing I can say about it is that it finally convinced me to go out and buy the OED (though I settled for the two volume ""shorter unabridged"".)"
2,Feel the Hype!,"Here's today's thesis (and I dare anyone to deny it): ""Infinite Jest"" isn't a novel at all. It is, rather, a publicity gimmick joined to an Oedipal struggle with Thomas Pynchon. Dare you to deny it.Wallace is an energetic writer, often a funny one, occasionally intelligent and moving. And Gately is a good, palpable presence. But what's on view here clearly has little to do with literature, indeed hardly anything to do with any kind of communication. The meretricious length, the super-meretricious technical language, the hyper-meretricious (and awfully quaint) structural shenanigans -- well, all this necessary invocation of the ""m""-word can indicate only one thing: this baby was designed as a career-booster, and as such, as all the evidence shows, it has achieved its one unqualified success."
2,Contrived,I stopped reading this book after three chapters. It felt contrived and I did not look forward to reading it.
2,Too boring,"First, I will admit it upfront-- I couldn't finish it. It was too boring. I cared not a whit about the characters. The plot was, well, also boring. Addiction? yawn.I gave it two stars because the language and some of the phrases are interesting. This book should be reclassified as Poetry and removed from Fiction (where one usually expects a narrative)."
2,Wasted,"If I hadn't been reading this a couple of pages at a time while on the toilet I would have considered it an almost complete waste of time. Aside from a smattering of brilliant passages addressing various addictions and compulsions I found the book shapeless and essentially without vision. I keep hearing about Wallace's ""genius"" but mostly what I picked up on was an almost ridiculous obsession with minutia and absurdly arcane detail. I probably should have started with his essays. As it is, this book pretty much put me off. I'll go back to reading Pynchon whose fluid and ambidextrous prose makes reading Wallace like plowing through the unrelenting monochromatic drone of a term paper written while under the influence of methamphetamine."
2,"""Infinite Jest"" paperback","The ""Infinite Jest"" paperback I purchased was an infinite mess: it had misprints. Still, the price for the 1,000 + page tome was a bargain. I guess you get what you pay for."
2,Writing - good; Footnotes - unnecessary; Ending - where?,"I gave this book two stars because I was so annoyed by the absence of an ending. True, the reader can imagine one, but that's not why we read other people's books. I was gripped by the book, and it is very well written. The characters are interesting, and well drawn. But, and this is a big but, you have these annoying footnotes which are not necessary. They seem to exist only to annoy the reader, as most of the footnotes should be in the main text. They are particularly annoying if you read them in the bath. The main problem is the fact that the author takes you right up to the climax, and just stops. It's as though he didn't have time to finish it before the publishers' deadline. The reviewer below who said that it needed 100 more pages got it spot on. I would have really enjoyed those 100 pages, too."
1,Nice Cover - Stops There,"Ok - I am pretty hard to chase away from a book, espically one that got as much hype as Infinite Jest. Is the praise for this book some kind of publisher-sponsored cabal?This thing wanders around worse than Blog. Does the next wave of fiction not require editing? Is there a voice in there? I confess, I couldn't even pick it up anymore after 150 pages. I came to this site just so I could rant somewhere.Comparisons to Pynchon are perhaps the greatest jest of all. Pynchon's work has a voice and a world. This book reads, at best, like the notes for a book. The first draft maybe, or the spewings of someone with a serious case of hypergraphia.And what's up with the middle name? Why doesn't the author just go all the way and call himself D. Foster Wallace? That's the pinnacle of pretense, which perhaps is the wellspring of this tedious tome.A bit harsh, to be sure, but with so many pages, I expected so much good reading. This soup needs reduction. There - now I can move on."
1,Infinite Snooze,After reading the reviews I couldn't wait to get my hands on this book. I gave it about 85 pages and then totally gave up on this snoozer.
4,it's about addiction,"forget what you read about an ""irresistible movie"" or other plot synopses. This book is about addiction. period. I did enjoy reading it, although at times I think Wallace is quite cruel in his depictions of people. Reading it now, in 2009, post-his suicide, I may read more pain in to it than was there when he wrote it; but to me his depression and issues are clearly there on the page.But basically, it's about addiction...Anne Brock"
4,The Year of Most-Bang-for-the-Buck Book,"This is one of those books that makes you feel stupid. Either that or you get this suspicious feelings that everyone else is somehow so much smarter than you, even though yourself is not stupid, so to speak. Not understanding anything before or after reading this voluminous work of ... what? genius? I remember one thing: I had fun reading it. Funny, weird, addicting, and if you are a retired, fulltime reader of books, as I am, you might as well read it, or even buy the book. Over 1000 pages for under $18 (softcover). To me, that's a good deal of enjoyable writing for the buck, whether you understand the totality of it or not."
5,Must own this book.,I loved this book. The library hardcover is out of my hands now. But I have to own this book. I can't stop thinking about this book. I keep making connections between things. Right down to the initials. How much was planned versus how many connections came to life in the writing? I don't have to be so analytical. Enough to last the rest of my life. I have to own this book.
2,Infinitely hard to read,"I don't know, maybe it was just me, but this book was all over the place and hard to follow. The weird use of phrasing and language with some of the characters was especially distracting. The New York Times, Time Mag., etc. all said good things... but I just didn't get it."
1,open heart surgery sans an anesthetic is preferable,"want to experience a pre-frontal lobotomy;or what it would be like to count all the grains of sand at the beach? Then read' infinite jest'by D.F.W.I suppose selling 5 or 6 copies of a novel now constitutes a best seller.Everyone who purchased this book and read every word,please raise your hands.I thought so.I'm sure the ivy covered quasi-pseudo semi-intellectual set just loved chatting this one up over double de-caf expresso's at Starbucks.A great novel to have written if your intent is to impress freshman eng.lit.majors.I'll bet Dave had to beat off the nubile young co-eds after they read this one-or maybe just the back photo was enough to do the job."
1,Totally over-rated,"Mr. Wallace seems more impressed with his own writing than he is with telling a good story. I couldn't MAKE myself finish this book. The reviews of this book were great. It makes me wonder if the reviewers were too embarassed to admit they didn't ""get it"" so they went along with everybody else. I'm no rocket scientist, but I'm not stupid either although I kind of felt stupid because I just didn't ""get it""."
1,I've Been Snookered,I've read non-conventional fiction for years. This is the first time that I have felt that the author was giving me the finger and snickering because I was naive enough to think that Infinite Jest was a serious literary effortJim Icard
1,Generic Pynchon...,"I'll quickly get to the point, which is something that Wallace himself is incapable of: utter crap! Now just imagine how many trees could have been saved at the expense of this man's career..."
1,The joke's on us.,"Yeah, you're right, Wallace, that was actually pretty funny. Could have been a lot better with an editor though, and maybe a liberal and entirely random pruning of eight-hundred or so pages. Troglodyte."
2,I read the New York Magazine article,"I thought this would be a good book about taking drugs and wanting to kill yourself because you are mental. It was a bad book, and i could not read any more. I threw the book out and was dissappointed. I took my own drugs instead and had a much better time than readint this book. Don.t believe the hype, this book is no good. It has a lot about highschool kids playing tennis."
1,unfinishable,"200+ pages in: LOTS of people, places, things, ideas introduced and nothing is happening. There is no story, no narrative...is this an essay? an MFA thesis? something to support a grant proposal? who cares? There is no sympathetic character anywhere in sight. Self-indulgent, pretentious rubbish."
1,Jest a position,"All the prosemongers and haiku-hacks. Here the one star, faded four. Strike it through with balanced line, measure of the whole - please bring it back."
5,What's important here?,"This is a novel about addiction - to drugs, to drug treatment, to sex, nationalism, tennis, and more. In turn the novel becomes addictive, and thus as with any addiction there are highs, lows, cravings, remorse, anxieties and so on. No, it is not always ""easy"" or ""fun"", and yes it is challenging, maddening, and confusing, but so are addictions, and so is life."
3,"some good, some bad","I like this book. I keep it on the nightstand to read when I can't sleep. It has some great vocabulary, entertaining footnotes, and incisive insights. Imagine Kurt Vonnegut on super steroids backed up with the complete OED."
5,Outstanding!,"I spent much of last summer reading David Foster Wallace's Infinite Jest. In spite of its backbreaking length, the novel is surprisingly manageable. Foster Wallace tells the stories of several outrageous characters, all sharing a common drug addiction. He spins an absurd tale of hypersmart children, toblerone-fiending Arab sheiks, and even conspiring North American secessionists, but through it all, his dictum remains unperverted. Infinite Jest is an awe-inspiring cacophony of wit and creativity. In fact, it has forced the creation of an entirely new genre. Foster Wallace blends elements of Pynchon and Heller, and then adds his own humorous touch. Authors such as Mark Leyner now follow Infinite Jest's lead: in particular, a highly stylized satire and the introduction of a chic class of intellectual youth. Infinite Jest is a solid reassurance that today's writers can rival the best of the literary masters."
3,Indescribable,Fantastic read. I just wish there had been more of a resolution to some of the story lines. Great anyway.
4,"Infinite Jest, a different read","I bought ""Infinite Jest"" because I had heard a fascinating piece on NPR about its author, David Foster Wallace. The writing is quirky, but incredibly compelling and insightful. Reminds me of James Joyces' ""Ulysses."" It's a different kind of read, but rewarding and makes me want to read more of his stuff."
2,it'd be a lot better if it had nothing to do with tennis,"i lugged this book around three continents in a backpack. all i can say is, tennis?"
2,I was not impressed!,I was looking forward to a great novel that would make me laugh and cry and this was NOT it. This is the FIRST time I've ever not finished a book I've started. I have read the first 150 pages and find it very hard to follow as well as far too rambling
2,maybe it's me but I just don't get it.,I've tried to read this book 3 times and have had to admit defeat about three hundred pages in.Maybe I haven't taken the required drugs in the required combinations.I tried 3 times because I felt that it was a book that I should read. On the third attempt I decided it wasn't. What it is basically is a vomit of vocabulary.David Foster Wallace is a John Barth for the late nineties and that ain't no compliment baby.
1,Blah Blah Blah - A Big Pile of Linguistic Sludge,The hype around this book is swirling. People will tell you that you must read it. Don't listen. Don't listen.
3,Good Read,My 15 yr old son carries this book with him. While it is not my kind of book he seems to like it although he has yet to finish it as it is a very long long book.
2,Infinite waste of time,"For well over a thousand pages, Wallace attempts to impress us with his wit and knowledge. It doesn't work. The book ends up being a pretentious and self-indulgent mess. Wallace wants to posture himself as a Joyce or a Pynchon or even a Fuentes, but falls woefully short. The characters are shallow; many sub-plots are left unresolved; and too many witticisms are purloined from other sources. If this is the new direction literature is taking, please God, let me off of this bus before it crashes and burns."
2,"""That isn't writing, it's typing.""","Once you've discarded character and plot as essential elements of your fiction, what are you left to work with? Description, some shoehorned essays, perhaps a bit of meta-commentary on your chosen metier. That's not enough to keep me interested. If you're asking me to wade through 1000 pages, I want a *story*. Without story, all you're doing is showing me how clever you are.As Truman Capote famously said about _On The Road_, ""That isn't writing; it's typing."" That pretty much sums up _Infinite Jest_, as far as I'm concerned."
5,A True Classic,"For all of my life I've been a voracious reader; yet very few books gave me as much pleasure as ""Infinite Jest"". A savage satire on our way of life, yet truly funny and immensely readable, with a character of its very own. I am certain that in a hundred years' time, it will rank as equal to Tom Jones, Tristram Shandy and Gulliver's Travels as a true classic. A rare pleasure I would recommend to all."
2,So What?!! Long OVER-rated.,"I've rarely laughed out loud reading any novels...and this book was no exception. If I had read this novel when I was in High School I might have thought differently about it. I may have enjoyed the sophmoric humor or marveled at the descent of a drug addiction.So what? Wallace never convnices me that he has any more profound a view of the world than I did at sixteen...and that's the waste. I can appreciate new and novel approaches to even the most tired of experimental fiction but, his is neither. I believe he's decades behind his time. Don't listen to those that are fighting to be the first to proclaim the next Joyce, Faulkner or Pynchon. Even the novel mocks itself...and for good reason...a long, bad joke. By the way, I also used to think that the ""Doors"" were cool...then you grow up."
1,I wanted to like it,"I got to page 500 or so and realized I had no desire to continue reading this book. Of what I read, I'd say maybe 25% of it was character-driven and the rest was setting description and fictional history review, which is really boring. I kept expecting it to get through the drawl and into the so-called ""good stuff"" (like in 1984, that horribly boring explanation of world and country history halfway through the book,) but after 500 pages that was looking like it wasn't coming. From reading other peoples' 1-star reviews it doesn't look like it ever picks up. So I give up. I wasted $17."
2,This Emperor Has No Clothes,"I just finished laboring through Infinite Jest, and have to say that this may well be the most incoherent, unsatisfying novel I've ever read. In short doses, it's intriguing, but the sheer length (about 1,000 pages, and boy do I pity the editor) would suggest that there would be some degree of resolution by the end of this arduous journey. But there isn't.The book starts with an interesting set of scenes (a top-ranked tennis player getting rejected at the University of Arizona after a medical/psychotic meltdown in the Admissions office, a set of odd interactions around procuring drugs in Boston). But we then go back in time, never to emerge. When I finally got to the novel's conclusion, I just couldn't believe that so much undisciplined, rambling prose would leave the reader out in the wilderness.Save yourself lots of time and find another book to read."
4,An excellent surprise,"The general text is interesting only for one that discovers that famous family of fighters, although I learned some details I did not know before. A very satisfying point : the photos are well chosen the most of which not already seen in other books. There are errors in the black and white drawings, a non-uncommon fact in Squadron-Signal publications. The color drawings are pretty good, some minor errors occuring here and there. But watch the color drawing at the top of the rear cover page : the mechanics working around a Folgore are out of scale with the plane !"
4,Decent quality at a cheap price. Classic 'toons of yesterday.,"Don't let the incredibly cheap price fool you, the quality of this DVD is not bad. Mastered directly from original 16mm film prints, not video tape. If you love rare B&W classic cartoons, don't miss this bargain!"
4,Great as a kid,"Well, I was about 8ish/9ish when I first saw this movie, and I loved it only because I had a crush on Jay! I haven't watched it in a while, but from what I can remember of it (as a kid) I think it is a perfect movie for those 'kids' out there who aren't quite teenagers yet. Hopefully when I watch it again now it will rehash those same happy memories."
5,We loved this movie back in the day!,"When I say we, I remember I used to be in the YMCA's summer program and they would take us on trips during the day and do activities with us and we went to a movie theater to see this film and we loved it. We all laughed at the part when the boy squirted pee on the guy! We were kids and we loved it what can I say. It was a beautiful thing. Great kids film. Very nostalgic."
4,A great family film...,"This is a sweet movie that people of all ages will enjoy. It does move a little slow, but the pace is comfortable. Fred Savage is great as Millie's little brother."
4,A movie about hope,"I remember this movie from years ago, and was looking for some uplifting title to watch and finally bought this. Fred Savage is wonderful as an eight year old dealing with his father's death. This movie does have a few ""gimme a break"" moments, but if you just suspend judgement it will make you feel so good. The message of the movie is that anything is possible, and it really is. You will smile."
5,"Outstanding, uplifting, 80's fairytale!","Some argue that this film takes a wrong turn at the end, but then I guess that depends on your own personal outlook on life. In my opinion, this film is pure perfection from the first frame until the last. Truly a classic from the 80's and for all time.One of my ALL-TIME favorite films!- JM"
2,Wrong Region,"Waited forever to get this movie, when I received it, IT WAS THE WRONG REGION; fortunately my DVD player on my computer allows me to change regions ""5"" times. ***I guess after that the movie is no good??? Two stars because the movie itself is grea----------t! But I would never trust this company again!!!"
3,"MONA, AND HER CATTY FRIENDS","The Boy Who Could Fly, was a very good movie, but my favorite character was Mona, and when she threw the volleyball at the main girl from the movie. Her presense in the film had everything to do with the movie."
1,The worst movie of all time!,I saw this movie when I was little and I didn't like it. It was the most boring movie I have ever saw. The acting is terrible and it was one of the worst movies I have ever seen in the 80's.
5,"Never give up on your dreams, Eric didn't so why should we!!","I remember wathing this movie, when I was a little kid, and I had always wanted a copy, so I was able to find one today. This is a great movie!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
3,Cute baby book but...,"It's a cute baby book, but I wish it left more space for 'Baby's Birthday.' What happened that day? how the baby was born, who came to the hospital...Seems like the most important part and there is just room for the basics, when? where? baby's weight? Okay book, but like I said, I would prefer to tell a bit of a story during that timeframe."
5,Sweet Baby Book!,I'm very happy with this baby book. It is just as sweet as I hoped. I bought it for our third child and from experience I know that baby books that are too big become too challenging once the baby actually arrives. This one has just the right amount of space for special memories and important information. I particularly liked the space for a baby photo of mom and dad and the growth chart included with the book.
4,Great,"Great book, lots of pages, all the important information for baby is included, great price, great condition"
1,"Taste bitter, rancid and peppery","I have been eating sunflower seeds for decades. I have had David's, Giant, Spitz, bulk from the grocery, mail order and grow your own. I can say without any reservation that these Klein's Natural Dry Roasted, Unsalted sunflower seeds are the worst I have ever had.I ordered a case, a six pack, of the 9oz containers. They arrived quickly enough, sealed carton, then each of the six packs were individually plastic sealed.The first four packs were completely inedible. They tasted like dust, pepper and a bit of carbonation. I haven't opened the last two because samples from the first four were so awful.Save yourself some money and grief and order a different product.This is just my opinion."
4,"Very tasty, large sunflower seeds","Overall, these seeds are larger than what you get from David's. One reviewer said they were narrow, but I'd say it is just that they are longer than Davids, but the width is about the same in some cases, so many seem narrower, but they are really still larger. Also, someone else pointed out some bugs. I haven't found any, but I have found some stem pieces and other plant parts. Not a big deal to me. I might not like finding a roasted bug, but if I did-- well, it is a natural product. Something else I found in the first two canisters-- a single roasted pumpkin seed in each. And let me tell you, those are tasty, too. I wonder if they put them in there on purpose, because I might buy those next."
2,Klien Seeds,"I wasn't really happy with this product, the seeds were too long and narrow and difficult to open. Flavor was good but the difficulty in eating them made me not even finish one container..."
2,A lot of debris,"Purchased a pack of 6, shells are pretty good size but the seeds inside are very small also I found a lot of debris. I will not buy it again"
1,No power !,"When the unit arrived the internal rechargeable battery was dead. It would not operate even when plugged into a USB, until I removed the battery. Even then it had very little power and did noting for the air around me. I use ionizers on a regular basis so I'm familiar with how they work. I spent a few dollars to replace the battery in hopes that it would work better, but it didn't. The seller was very nice and took care of the problem."
5,Best Swaddling / Receiving Blanket!!,"I just love this blanket! I was given the sterling color as a gift for my baby's baptism. It has a beautiful white on white look and pretty stitching around the edge. It ended up being a lifesaver because my baby girl got very fussy before the service. I swaddled her nice and snug, and she settled down. Whew!I was able to hand her to our pastor in a cute quiet little bundle and she was the perfect angel. I've since bought more in other colors; pastel pink and pastel yellow, because it seemed like one was always in the wash and I didn't want to be without one! I think 3 is a good number to have! The Ultimate Swaddling Blanket is the gift I give now to my friends and I include the matching Burpies, which are awesome too!"
4,Well it was a little bit better then the first Herold and Kumar,"Basically the jokes in this film are the same type of comedy as the first film ""Herold and Kumar Go To White Castle"" only a little better especially the ones involving N.P.H. AKA Neil Patrick Harris. This movie really gets 3.5 stars, because it was funny but not quite laugh out loud funny."
2,Disappointing Follow-up,"The original Harold and Kumar wrapped insightful satire of the ethnic stereotypes and prejudices in American society with lowbrow humor and absurdly over-the-top situations. The result was a sleeper hit and a cult phenomenon.This movie focuses mainly on zany antics and (especially in the unrated version) extremely low-brow humor. Is there satire of our cultural stereotypes and preconceptions? Yes, there are ham-handed and obvious swipes at ""issues."" In this movie, however, rather than being a thoughtful subtext, they seem to be a desperate attempt to redeem a movie that is otherwise not worth watching.This movie has its moments, but way too few between the fart jokes."
4,Harold and Kumar Get the Munchies-Part Deux,"Crass. Infantile. Sophomoric. Gross. Vulgar. What do you say about a movie where the first shot is of Kumar sitting on the toilet? Nonetheless, I liked it despite myself. Not as good as the original but we all know the law of diminishing returns. Falls under the category of you laugh yourself silly even though you know better. It doesn't hurt that stars Kal Penn and John Cho have great comic rapport. Believe it or not there is some wit among the potty humor. Not for everybody but you know who you are."
5,Don't hate on this funny movie!,"Everyone loves to take a shot at light hearted stoner movies. But, let it go, chill out and watch this movie!It's not as original as the first movie, because it's a sequel! That doesn't mean it;s not cool, silly, filled with a great cast, and did I mention N.P.H. and the rainbow unicorn? Great times! Loved it enough to buy the movie poster!M.Luck, NorCal"
3,Escaping From Guantanamo Bay Was Pretty Funny!!!,"But it's not the best sequel I've seen. Right after returning from White Castle, Harold and Kumar try to go to Amsterdam to see Harold's girlfriend. During the flight, Kumar whips out a home-made bong and some racist old girl thinks he's a terrorist setting off a bomb. After they arrive in G.B. some real terrorists try to escape, and Harold and Kumar try to break out too. During their adventures, the dumb Government people try to get them back, they end up at a KKK meeting, meet Neil Patrick Harris again, smoke weed with George W. Bush and more. If you like Harold and Kumar, you might like HAROLD AND KUMAR ESCAPE FROM GUANTANAMO BAY!!!"
2,harold and kumar 2,"you might want to rent, some laughs here and there but it's missing that special magic the first one has."
5,Awesome,People may say it's not as good as the first one but I think that is only because of the prejudice you automatically have when a second movie gets released.This one is great because they have managed to capture the essence of the first movie. If they could not get the same actors it would not have been worth making....So do yourself a favour and get it! An instant classic!
3,OMG,"Silly, overt sexual behavior bordering on soft porn, exaggerated stereotypes, promotion of marijuana use, juvenile behavior... such a guilty pleasure (oh my goodness... did I just admit to liking this movie?). Despite many attempts to divert my eyes or coil in disgust at certain elements, the chemistry that Kal Penn and John Cho have is really amazing. Its also refreshing to see a movie like this where the two lead characters are not caucasian proving that certain aspects of culture are universal (in this instance it's questionable whether it is a good or bad thing).I'm giving Harold and Kumar Escape from Guantanamo Bay 3 stars instead of 4 because there were aspects of the movie and dialogue that I thought could have been better, but I had so much fun watching it... often covering my mouth and laughing in hysterics at the antics of the main characters and supporting cast. Completely ridiculous, much fun and worth seeing. :)"
5,What can be funnier than Harold and Kumar?,"If you love comedy, and goofy comedies at that you will love Harold and Kumar. H&K Goes to Whitecastle is still my favorite but this is a close second. Get it, it's laugh riot!"
2,Horrible- merely a shadow from part-1,"Wife and myself really enjoyed the part one, The White Castle movie. I had high hopes on part 2. However it is one of the most horrible movies we have ever seen. The movie is probably not appropriate for anyone, it was just indecent. Most of the flicks were copied from the first one, Kumar also looked much older compared to #1. Overall it is a trashy movie."
4,digital copy harold and kumar,anyone need the digital copy codes for this movie harold and kumar escape from guantanamo bay?
3,Not what I was hoping for,I have no problem with weed humor which is a big selling point for this movie. The problem is the humor was lacking all around for Guantanamo Bay. I am not sure if Harold and Kumar are trying to follow in Cheech and Chongs footsteps but if they are they have a long way to go. I watched the unrated version and besides for scene where everyone is bottomless it seemed to play as the original. This movie is at best worth one viewing and probably best scene as a rental. Buy the Search for Whitecastle if you want a Harold and Kumar movie.
4,Loved it,I love John Cho and Kal Penn. This was the perfect sequel to White Castle. I would love to see them do another as more mature adults growing with their core audience.
1,"Not good, not appropriate for most","I wasn't expecting much other then to be entertained. I watched Harold & Kumar's first movie about White castle and had a lot of laughs. The movie was funny, enough said.This movie however is totally inappropriate. It is filled with extreme nudity and inapprorpiate content. My nephew watched the first movie and wanted to see this one, I figured it would be similar comedy and. Nope, this was totally in approrpriate compared to the first movie. I am not sure what happens near the end because I turned it off before it got half way through.If you are looking for good family comedy look elsewhere. If you are looking for nudity (and lots of it), sexual references (and lots of it) then check this movie out.You have been warned."

1,Terrible,"One of the worst movies ever. I liked the first one. The second one is unfunny, offensive, and horrible. Being vulgar is not the same as being funny. Horrible.Yet another Bush-bashing movie, in which the bad guys are not the terrorists, but American government types. Very original. Way to ""take a risk"", Hollywood !!"
2,Was Expecting Better,I enjoy both comedians and I was excited when they came together but in my eyes this movie BOMBED! White Castle was good but I was just expecting this to be so much better. Maybe its something I have to watch twice over. I've had some of my favorite shows and movies be dumb and dull first time round but I just can't convince myself to watch this movie again anytime soon. Definatly a back shelf dvd for me.
4,Another good Harold and Kumar laugh,This is also another good priced movie and good for laughs. Both movies have there good scenes and there best scenes.. Either way i enjoy watching them.
1,An Awful Stoner Movie,I laughed a few times but for the most part it's a stupid movie. I'm only writing this review to save people their time and money by not watching this terrible flick.
1,WHAT THE....... ARE U SERIOUS???,"I GOT A GREAT IDEA....LETS MAKE A MOVIE AND PUT EVERYTHING WE CAN THINK OF DISGUSTINGLY STUPID IN IT AND HOPE PEOPLE LAUGH. WHAT A WASTE OF FILM... NOW BEFORE PEOPLE HATE WHAT I HAVE TO SAY,LET ME SAT THIS. I LOVED THE FIRST HAROLD & KUMAR. I LOVE A LOT OF DISGUSTING GROSS OUT HUMOR ALSO. HOWEVER THERE WERE ONLY A HANDFUL OF FUNNY PARTS AND IF YOU COULDN'T TELL THEY JUST THROUGH THIS PIECE OF GARBAGE TOGETHER, YOU'RE CRAZY!! THEY TRIED TOO HARD TO SHOCK PEOPLE WITH THE SICK STUNTS THAT IT WASN'T FUNNY. IT WAS LIKE, 'OHH COME ON, THAT'S STUPID'!! THIS IS WAS THIS MOVIE DID FOR ME, ABSOLUTELY LET ME DOWN WITH A HUGE,'WHAT THE....ARE U SERIOUS??I CAN'T BELIEVE THESE ACTORS WANTED THEIR NAMES ASSOCIATED WITH THIS GARBAGE.VIEWER BEWARE...."
1,Product not as described,"The case makes this look like a bootlegged copy, this was a gift for someone and I was humiliated. Thanks."
2,I'd love to know how good it is,"So I get the DVD, set up to watch it, and guess what?D R MThat's right, it won't play. The disk is fine, the player is fine, but some one went to extra trouble to make sure that I wouldn't be able to watch it.Skip the DVD, get a pirated version."
2,Disappointing,"I enjoyed the first Harold and Kumar a lot and was really looking forward to this sequal. After 4 years they DEFINITELY could have made the plot a lot better. This movie was too disgusting, too politically driven, and frankly, too similar to the first one! They got into a situation that was almost identical to the situation with ""Freakshow"" in the first one, and revolved it around chasing a girl--only this time Kumar was doing it. There were a few good jokes and scenes, but for the most part this sucked."
4,As Good as the First,"I just got finished watching this movie. At first I didn't think I would like it as good as the first film. I was def. suprised, I laughed all the was threw it. I highly recommend this dvd to anyone who owns the first, this is a must own. I hope they make a third film in the future."
3,Blubonnett CQ10,"While this product is billed as a Cq10 supplement, it's more of a multi vitamin with just 30 mg of cq10 per serving"
4,A romantic delight,"This little volume is chock full of tidbits about love and romance. Did you know, for example, that anthropologists believe the first kiss originated 4,000 years ago in what is now eastern India? Since that's after Moses' time, I wonder if he died without ever being kissed?Walker says the world's most torrid love poem was written in the 18th century and to see a copy you'd have to have special permission from the board of governors at the British Museum. Not only that, you'd have to read it -- under guard -- in a special room at the museum. Now that's great PR. It's like telling college freshmen that state law prevents them from reading Chapter 3 in their geology book. I bet that law prompted more students to read about evolution than ever would have without it.That's a small example of the fascinating little snippets of information in this book. It's great fun."
4,silver beads,"You may never go to Mexaco but like all Kenworthy's books, there is valuable information in here for spanish trail follower."
5,If I could give it 6 stars- I would!,"The best books I have read were always based, to some degree, upon fact. Mr. Hickam, with his experience in the space program, takes this experience and interweaves it into an amazing 'can't put down' book. My next hope- that if a movie is made- it will be be at least half as good as the book- but it will be tough. Have fun!"
1,"This was a poor book, unlike Rocket Boys.","I agree with Herndon, Virginia - this book had too much fantasy to be enjoyed. It's much like James Bond - the bad guys' bullets always miss, Bond has some techie watch/pen/car/etc. up his sleeve, only his exploits can save the world (in the book's case, energy usage), he gets the girl in the end.The prose of this book is not up to what we read in Rocket Boys. I suspect a ghost writer in one of them.Please buy and read Rocket Boys if have not done so already. You won't be disappointed.This book, however, was a disappointment for me."
1,No Science Here!,"This book isn't even worthy of science fiction. Bad science and bad characters make for a bad book. I really enjoyed Rocket Boys and looked forward to this book. Whew, what a let down. I keep almost of all of my books and will reread even those I don't like. This one will go in the Goodwill bin."
2,"Interesting concepts, but cardboard characters","I felt the characters were weakly drawn and their reactions to plot developments pretty formulaic. The plot itself pushed my credibility a bit too much, and resolutions were all too neat. Hickam's purpose in writing this novel is to challenge our failure of imagination in manned space exploration since the Apollo missions. His creative adaptation of well-known shuttle technology to a lunar mission is meant to awaken us to ""possibilities."""
2,credibility problems for Homer,"Sorry to rain on the Hickam-is-great parade, but I found the book completely implausible. So much so that I was unable to enjoy the ride. But let me say I LOVED Rocket Boys, and will try another Hickam book again. I don't know maybe I read it at a bad time, its happened where I miss a good book and only in rereading it do I realize how good it was...oh well for now I stand by my choice: Not very good"
2,Dissapointment,"I was captivated by his first book, Rocket Boys, but this book turned out to be a disappointment. I couldn't get in the groove. Put it down far too often."
5,My favorite everyday knife,"This is the second of this particular model that I've owned and I have loved them both. The Mini Covert is perfectly sized for everyday carry whether in jeans or slacks. It is not massive in size or weight, but the blade is large enough for anything that comes along. Construction, fit and finish are all good and the blade takes and keeps an edge well. I find no marks that indicate place of manufacture, but there are no quality issues regardless. If I could only own one knife, this would be the one."
3,Not the best but it could be serviceable,The knife was not very sharp out of the box. I was able to sharpen it easily enough but my biggest problem is with the opening mechanism. It is almost grindy. You can feel it when you open the blade. I have used this knife several times but mostly it sits in a side pocket of back pack and it only used when I do not have anything else. I do not recommend buying this product for anything else other than a last resort knife.
4,Gerber,Light weight; seems well made; thought I was purchasing the F.A.S.T model but still a good knife think I will keep and still order the F.A.S.T
1,Horrible,"Trusting L'Occitane, I purchased this product mainly for the orange scent. But, the only orange scent was for about half a second when first pouring out the product. Then the scent was replaced by a heavy perfume smell. If you are searching for a natural, citrus scent of some kind, do not buy this product."
3,"Good guide, altought with some weak points","I've been recently travelling all around Norway, from South to North, including the Arctic archipelago of Svalbard. I found this guide generally very useful, but weak when it comes to talk about the Nordland, the Far North (Troms and the Finnmark) and Svalbard. For example, Lofoten is surely a fascinating place especially for hikers - like I suppose the author is - but many description are exhagerated and you might be disappointed once there - like I was. The Nordland is not sufficiently covered and the information sometimes might be poor in contents. Same about the Finnmark. The Svalbard part of the guide could be more exhaustive, altought I agree is a surely less touristic place than Bergen as a matter of fact is. There is space for improvements, but you cannot find anything better packed."
4,Best of a bad bunch of books,"I'm still patiently waiting for a good Norway Tour Guide to be written. The Eyewitness Book is terrible. But out of a bad lot, perhaps the only one worth mentioning as worthy of taking along in a backpack is the Lonely Planet Norway.This book isn't great; maybe it isn't even very good, but at least it does spend some effort to describe many of the amazing sites Norway has to offer. It's still quite hard for me to imagine why this great country hasn't been covered by a good book.I for one borrowed the following books for my latest trip: Kon Tiki, The Moon is Down, A Collection of Plays by Ibsen, a Munch book, and the Lonely Planet Guide. I left the Eyewitness at home."
1,Buyer beware,"Bought this to help plan a trip I am taking in the fall. I noticed a previous reviewer complained about an outdated reference in his edition to something that would happen in 2008. But my copy was just issued in June 2011, so that would not be a problem, right? Incredibly, it is still in the book! Either the book was edited by a chimp, or, more likely, the only thing that was changed was the publication date. Unfortunately, I bought the Kindle edition and am stuck."
3,2008 print edition sold as 2010 Kindle edition,"I feel cheated. This so-called 2010 Kindle edition makes predictions about things that might happen by the end of 2008, such as Bergen having city-wide internet. Other parts seem out of date. This appears to be the 2008 print edition, simply renamed by Amazon as the 2010 Kindle edition. Lonely Planet is releasing a 2011 edition of this Norway guide in May 2011. I would have waited to buy the 2011 version had I not been misled by Amazon."
3,A daunting task...,"Norway's a deceptively large country with many, many small towns and interesting regions, all of which are separated by large distances. This book scratches the surface of all of them.I found the guide fairly weak for southwestern Norway (Stavanger & Bergen areas). While it did direct me to the more obvious tourist areas, I felt as if I had no idea about 90% of the other things I could do.In summary, because they try to cover the whole country in one book, the coverage of any one area tends to be superficial."
1,Kindle Edition is Worthless,"Bought the Kindle version and it's worthless. When you click a link, you can't return to where you were; the maps are on multiple pages so you can't read them, and on and on. Also no index or any way to find anything. Maybe the print version would be better?"
1,Horrible Kindle edition!,"For only $1 less than the print edition, I expect exactly the same quality of presentation from a digital edition, which should cost far less. The layout of this book is terrible, the appearance the same as free downloads (weird spacing, word breaks, typos), and the picture quality is appalling. If there were any way to return this, I would.Buy the print book. Do not waste money on this. Severely disappointed by this product."
2,Less practical than a 'real' book,"Purchase was very convenient: downloading while waiting in front of a Norwegian campsite with free WiFi (though it it took a little longer than expected because of the file size and the poor quality of the connection). Unfortunately the use of the guide was rather disappointing. The maps were in fact useless, because they were spread over different pages without a zoom function.There is no index. If you try to find information of, for example, a stave church, the search function of Kindle offers you a large number of hits you'll have to try, hoping to find the wanted information.The general information on Norway is ok, but I expected (much) more information on travelling options as well as accommodations.I'm afraid I would not recommend this guide to fellow travellers, certainly not in Kindle format.Sorry."
5,320GB vs 500 black,"I have had two 320gb drive since last Jan still run great, speed is faster than the two WD5001aals carver black I just got two days ago.I will be returning them and getting two more of the 320'sWestern Digital WD3200KSRTL Caviar 320 GB SATA 3.5-Inch Hard Drive"
3,Not as advertised,"It really is just a bare drive in a box. There was no cable included or driver disk. I would have been better off just buying an OEM driver from another online vendor, and saved money doing so."
5,Top Notch Backup HDD,"I'm running a little over 2tb worth of HDD space on my PC right now, only expanded after buying a HDD Sony Camcorder and getting into editing and making movies.I purchased this drive mainly as a back up for photos, music, and raw video files needing a place to stay till I get around to editing/deleting them. The install is very straight forward, and was complete in 5-10 minutes.This drive is very quite, almost silent even when at full operating speed (writing a 40-60gb video file, etc)I like having everything organized, and this drive really helped with that, since I can keep everything on it until I know what to do with it...or get time to work with it. As I mentioned its also nice for auto backups of photos and music.I think anybody from an all day computer user to somebody who just needs a place to store their family photos will appreciate the price, size, and quietness of this WD Caviar hard drive."
5,"Great, quiet drive",There's not a lot to say on the whole. I've used Western Digital hard drives for YEARS and had pretty reliable drives on the whole. This one has been extremely quiet and I like having the extra space for some video's. It replaces a former setup of dual 80gb WD EIDE drives and I like this setup much better and it really opened up the inside of the case for airflow and reduced heat by getting an extra drive out as well as the last of the EIDE cables.
5,Fast and reliable,I've been using this drive for two months.It performs just as expected: fast and reliably.Great value for the money.
5,memory !!,"I routinely see about 72-73 MB/s sustained reads off of the drives (reading a GB at a time) even with the interface strapped at SATA-I speeds (but note, the drives support and are shipped ready to run at the speedier SATA-II speeds).Pros: Fast, economical, and run fairly cool.Cons: 1 year warranty, could be longer."
5,Western Digital HDD,"Got this 320 GB HDD in the summer of 2008 when the new HDD in my newly built dual-core Biostar computer died. It's worked without a hitch since then as all hard drives should do. It hardly ever gets shut down except during power outages, restarts to complete installation of new software, or a system freeze-up (a very rare event on a Linux box)."
2,Dissapointed on misrepresented item,"I was dissapointed first by the packing. I ordered two, and both drives were in the same box, with no air bags or bubble wrap! They were floating around the box, unbelievable...On top of that, these do not have the dual power outlets which is what I was wanting.THEY ONLY HAVE SATA POWER as NOT shown in product photography."
1,Never Received Product,"BEWARE OF THIS SELLER. Paid for, but never received product, and seller did not respond to my email. I have not received a refund. Didn't realize I was purchasing from Amazon Marketplace, or I would have read other feedback from users with the same issue as myself. So, look elsewhere!"
2,Would prefer to rate this as 2.5.,"""Biloxi Blues"" is nothing like ""Brighton Beach Memoirs,"" so if you're hoping for more of the same, don't bother. Eugene is very different; more mature (still obsessed with sex, nonetheless.). The humor is much more crude than the first play, and much darker. Eugene is not in this play a lot, which may explain my lack of laughing. I couldn't warm up to any of the characters like I did in ""Brighton Beach Memoirs."" Even though I was disappointed with this play, I'll still read the third play of this trilogy. I do not recommend."
4,Great compact bag with plenty of pockets,"I bought this bag for my 15"" Dell, I also carry a lot of folders, chargers, wireless mouse, MP3 and junk in my bag. It's a little hard to get the laptop in the bag if it's full of folders, but other than that its very durable and a great bag. The lumbar padding is great. I carry it everyday, there's a pocket everywhere for anything you could imagine."
2,"Nice bag, but no quality control","I really liked this bag, not excessively huge, just enough for me to carry my 13"" macbook/power cord, essentials, a few notebooks and my water bottle. It's not big and bulky, and being a girl I liked that a lot.HOWEVER, the first bag I ordered came, and had a defective strap where the piece of plastic holding the bottom strap to the top strap was malformed, rendering it useless (someone had to have seen this during inspection, since the other strap was put together fine). So I sent that one bag, and Amazon sent a replacement VERY quickly and I was very happy. Two weeks after using the replacement, I notice that the top handle has started to fray off, and in a few days, it was already half frayed and I couldn't use it. So I sent it back and got a SwissGear pack.So yeah, nice bag if you don't need to carry around a ton of heavy books, but beware of quality."
4,"Great Design, But Lacks Large Pockets","Great bag. Would buy again for the amount of protection it provides for my 15-inch laptop.PROS:- The styling is great.- The bag securely holds the laptop with a good amount of protection- Outside pockets are ideal for waterbottles, small digital cameras.- The shoulder straps are a great balancer for the weight of the laptop on the back.CONS:- This bag can only be used for transporting a laptop. There is not enough room for anything less.- The inside pockets are too small for holding battery cords, and wireless devices. (Do fit inside general area in the main pocket)- The bag is a ""hefty"" weight. (I'm a woman, and it gives me some trouble)."
1,Not as big as it looks,"I had this bag for a day. The pockets are not set up very well the ones on the side are worthless. The way the bag opens its hard to get your laptop in. After putting my laptop in the pocket that is attached was so tight I could not put anything in it, theres no way the charger and cables would fit. The Velcro pocket inside are small as well."
5,Best backpack for the money!,"very nice backpack. I have got one for my daughter now this one is for son. both love it. Maybe I will get one for me one day!durable, stylish, comfortable and works well for laptops!lots of handy pockets.other students like my kids backpacks and are asking where they can get their own!"
5,Good product,I like it.. Its simply and can hold alot of stuff including a laptop. The water pockects are cool
1,Worst buy with Amazon,"Hi All. The bag look real cool , good in website , Quality sucks . Bad experience for me buying this online. Design is excellent but the quality of material & Zip is of poor quaity to buy for 40$ , I'd rather recommed SwissGear , Belkin or some other brands , Trying to re-sell it for much cheaper price."
5,GET THIS BAG,"I've read in some reviews where people thought this bag was too big, but I find it to be the perfect size. The bag is built very well. Seems very sturdy. The White Camouflage looks great and bag has more than enough pockets. You open a pocket to find another pocket in that pocket. Great bag!! This bag has more than enough room for your laptop, and ALL the accessories you carry with it (cables, mouse, disks...etc.). Even though I received this as a gift... I would have paid the asking price for this bag."
1,Top handle broke after 3 weeks,"I am very dissapointed, the top handle snapped after 3 weeks and I had just one book and my computer. Not so good quality as I expected. ANyways, i guess for just a computer and charger, it wont break."
3,Sonofa,"I've picked up this bag about 10 times and the top handle just ripped off. I had my laptop and 1 book in there. that's it. I just thought I would share that with everyone. I'm sure there are many other people out there still happily grasping their handles, but I am not one of them. mine is off."
4,Very nice and low cost product,It's an incredible product and the price is very nice. I have a Samsonite backpack that costed me around 60 dollars and this backpack has the same features but there's a huge difference in price.
2,Do not expect too much ---,"I received this laptop backpack last week and I thought it's of better looks and quality as how it's presented here in [...]. Just don't expect too much. The price may attract you but you might regret it once you receive it. I'm a 25 year old woman and I have numerous shoulder bags, pocket books and at least 7 backpacks at home - this is nowhere close to the old ones that i have."
1,Wonderful,"I am so grateful to Richard Jensen for this sensible and informative book. I highly recommend the chapters on mental illness, as learning about, and subsequently using, inosital for depression and panic has changed my life for the better. A 'must-read' for everyone concerned about their own, or a loved ones, health."
2,Almost unreadable.,"Very hard to read, as the writing and lack of any editing make this a jumbled mess. I have read many books about the Ford family and this did provide a few extra tidbits that I had not heard before. It also gave a few fresh insights into life at Fair Lane."
3,Could use a good edit,"Donn Werling writes about little-known aspects of Ford's life, especially his home life, so for ""Fordophiles"" the book is interesting. But it assumes a lot of knowledge about Ford, and often does not explain rather obscure references. The writing is inconsistent, sometimes rambling. If you are looking for a basic history of Ford's life, this is not the book for you. If you are an enthusiast who wants to know more interesting factoids, and are willing to wade through to find them, then get this book."
3,Easy and entertaining to read,"I got this book as a ""mandatory"" handout from my employer when we went through one of our many change initiatives. It is true: when upper management is desperate, they initiate a change initiative, i.e. change for the change's sake, because changes initially always have an impact and make the shareholders happy. The question is, how long does it last, and what is the ultimate goal of the change? One thing is sure, consultants hired as change champions make a good money with it.Everybody who raises such sarcastic remarks as I do in in this review, is considered as ""resistant to change"" and faces a threat to further career development.This book helps a lot to put things into the right perspective. It covers the need for change and also deals with the natural reservations we all have when we undergo changes in our environment. Thus, it is very helpful, but don't consider it as your single source about this topic."
1,DISAPPOINTED CUSTOMER,"I would love to review this product; however, since it (surprisingly) came without a blade, I am unable to evaluate it. Equally surprisingly, there is no mention in the catalog that no blade is supplied and no option to purchase a blade.Makita 2107F 6.5 Amp 4-3/4-Inch by 4-3/4-Inch Capacity Variable Speed Portable Band Saw"
2,Disappointing,"In my hamble openion is that such work should be assessted by a technique to teach you how to spot tactics. what you will get here is a list of tactical motives with a good collection of solved exercises then unsolved ones. of course the meat is the solved ones to help you understand ideas behind the subject but you will find yourelf with solution just put on front of you without any idea how to reach them.to be honest here, the book title say for the tournament player which is not my case but also I do not believe this is the way things to be presented for a tournament player."
3,Please Read,"This book is good.It presents many tactical motifs and defines them clearly, so that you can instantly recognize them, and put them into practice in your very own games. Of course this is all excellent, however, i have to say, that there are many others books, which offer the same instruction at a lower price, and dont mislead you. There is no secret to this book, apart from teh very well organised method of chess study. This book is good for begginers, who want to improve fast, and those of you who are intermediate players or above, will surely benifit from reviewing the material presented in this book, however i beleive players above begginer strength should buy (Test you chess IQ: First challenge) - these are a set of tactics books, which present tests, which are to be carried out as if it were you playing in a tournament. Its much better for a stronger player."
5,"Should be titled "" . . . for the serious player""","If you are serious about chess and want to improve, then this book is for you. It is just like a textbook and it should be read from cover to cover. However, it's difficult to get anywhere with this book unless you dedicate an hour a day to it almost every day. The examples are great and the explanations are good. If you are serious about chess, then this book may be the one for you."
1,A very poor tactics book for ordinary players.,"If you are a master or stronger, you might enjoy some of the world-class tactics featured in this book. I am rated 1936 and it is still above my level. I also don't like the organizaiton of the book, and prefer just diagrams like in Sharpen Your Tactics. For me this book was a waste of money.For mere mortals, there are far better choices, like Sharpen Your Tactics, Chess Tactics for Juniors, The Complete Chess Workout, and Practical Chess Exercises (which I love, but it is more about all aspects of the game. It is also not a beginner's book. I recommend it for 1700+.)"
3,its kinda good,this book is good but there are some better books in that field like Kotovs Books and sierawans as well anyway this book may be a good deal
1,"A boom box, not a karaoke machine","I'm not sure what I expected after I purchased this for fifty some-odd dollars and was handed a coupon for a $40 rebate. But I wish that someone had informed me before I lugged it all the way home that when you sing into the mic, your voice doesn't come through the speaker. I'm cool with the machine's sound quality when it comes to playing a CD-G. If I tap the mic, I can hear an extremely faint thud, so I know it's on, but the volume's too low--and, yes, I adjusted the mic controls--if you want to sing along. Which makes this a dinosaur: a boom box in the age of the iPod.Really had to dig through the stacks of machines to find a box that hadn't been opened. So, when was my first clue? Doh!"
4,Get it from the library,Try not to spend your money on this book. Try getting it from the library / friend.Its ok. I was able to go through about 70% of it.
5,One of the most worthwhile-to-read books on Christ,This is certainly one of the most worthwhile-to-read books on Christ. Highly recommended.
4,Dripping with catchy melodies.,The album is a solid mix of the electronic format blended with a voice that you can't help but pay attention to. I did find the tail end of the album tends to drag with a slower paced mood.
2,amazon's recommendations template needs revised,"This is nothing like yo la tengo, which prompted amazon's recommendation of this album. This is butt slam disco pop. Hey, the production is fine, and they have sultry melodies, butt if you like yo la tengo or my morning jacket or grizzly, this may or may not jive with your sensibilities. The breathy guy vocals seem contrived. Oh well, at least Eagles of Death Metal still rock."
2,"it's ok, but ""G.T. and the Halo Express"" is much better","My girls (ages 6 & 9) like these CD's ""ok"". Of the three CD's, I like the 3rd the best.Instead, I would recommend any tapes of ""G.T. and the Halo Express"" by King Communications. These tapes share musical bible verses in the context of a story, which makes them MUCH more memorable. Their music is original and very high quality. My girls and I LOVE all the G.T. tapes and have learned a lot from them!!"
2,Huge,"The product information lists the measurements for this unit, but if you are like me measurements probably don't help you much. This MP3 player is huge. One reviewer wrote that it would easily fit in his hand or pocket, well so would my cell phone and guess what they are practically the same size. Compared to some of the Sony and Samsung units this thing is a Cadillac.The sound quality is very good, but not better than my wife's Samsung, which she can easily clip to her shirt or put in her pocket. Putting this thing in my shirt pocket makes my shirt sag and putting it in my pants pocket . . .well, you get the idea."
3,"Nice Player, but poor variable bit rate (VBR) support","I have two, T10-1GB players. They are great in all respects, except for VBR support. This is OK if you use music ripped from CDs where you can choose the format and bit rate. However, if you download music from MSN, it comes in VBR format.Songs downloaded in VBR format have a tendency to skip in places - most annoying. If you look at the firmware history on their web site, they specifically say they have added support for VBR in firmware version 1.53. The latest version is 1.70 and it's not working.I have had a case open with iRiver for 4 months. I have not heard from them in the last two."
5,Meat Market is a must read!,I've given Meat Market as a present to many people and its been consistantly praised as a life-changing read. I encourage everyone to purchase this book and pass it on to the next person. You'll never regret it!
4,Want to know all the nasty details!,Not as descriptive as I would have liked but very informative of things I did not think about before
5,A must read for families,Fun with the Family in Maine is a comprehensive guide for activities and fun destinations for kids. Our family has already used the guide several times on our excursions to Maine and all of the tips we took from the book have been a big hit with all 5 of our kids. It helps immensely that the author is a parent of young children and that she adds her own personal experiences with some of the destinations. This is a fun-filled and very well written travel book that I would highly recommend to anyone who plans a trip to Maine!!
3,"3.5 stars - Better than good, but not his best.","Dunning has created a wonderful character in Janeway. He's a tough ex-cop who knows how do to long stakeouts, understands judges and knows when a crime scene investigation has been bungled. He also knows books, finding, valuing and selling them. It's a combination that leads to a fully dimensional, and very interesting, character. He also knows how to build an excellent supporting cast, create a sense of place and build tension. If I wish his dialogue were better, that's a small criticism. For those of us who love books and tough-but-tender investigators, this is a very enjoyable series."
4,The Sign of the Book,"Okay, for a person who is a book fanatic what could be better than a book about a book dealer?? This series is a real winner. Good stories with enough twists to keep the reader interested right to the end. Lots of tidbits about the book business too which is always a plus just in case I win the lottery and buy that book store I always wanted."
4,Compelling and Engaging!,"I really enjoyed this book by John Dunning. I found that once I had started I couldn't put the book down. As usual it was full of surprises right up until the end. That's what I like the most about this Bookman's series. It always keeps me guessing. There wasn't as much information this time about the book industry, and for me that was something that I missed, but the story is captivating just the same. We have Cliff and his lady-love in a small town called Paradise in Colorado in late fall and early winter (right up to Christmas). Both are trying to help an old friend of Erin's who has been charged with the murder of her husband. Cliff follows the books as usual, and tries to piece together what happened on that fateful day. Janeway is as usual as real as they come. His character is so strong and yet so vulnerable. This is a wonderful series."
4,Sweet Twist,"Other reviews ding ""Sign of the Book"" for a langorous and almost-leads-nowhere subplot. I enjoyed the whole ride and I think the subplot sets up the surprise ending quite nicely. Dunning's mash-up of the used book and rare book world with murder and mayhem works nicely again, in all because Cliff Janeway is such a believable mash-up of ex-cop turned book dealer. He does have flaws, he does get brusque and tough, and he can square off with the toughest out there. My one problem here (minor issue) was the one-note, small-town-tough, jerk-cop character. Just too much of an easy enemy and his protestations from the witness stand, near the end, didn't seem plausible. But the shudders from the boy's drawings and the stunning revelation from the ""death room"" easily outweighed this flaw. A terrific ride in a Colorado mountain town. People who enjoy Cliff Janeway might also enjoy meeting a fellow fictional Coloradoan, Allison Coil.Antler Dust"
4,"Clichéd characters, yet readable","How are these for clichés: a former cop - bounced from the force for excessive use of force - is now a private investigator; his girlfriend is also a lawyer and continually feeds him cases to solve, which he in turn screws up; the principal character owns a book store; there's a crooked cop who hampers the investigation. All of these and more are part of this book, and yet it is still an exciting, fast-paced read, if maybe too long. Cliff Janeway is the P.I./bookshop owner, and Dunning has written several novels based on this character. This was an easy, breezy read and I might try another. Recently a large percentage of characters I have met in fiction have owned bookstores. If that were the case in real life, the book business wouldn't be in such turmoil."
4,"Good mystery, well-paced","This was my first John Dunning book and I will return for more I believe. It is a good mystery story, competently told, and well-paced to keep you turning the pages. (Although to be honest, I listened to the audio book, which was very well ""acted""). The plot has already been summarized so I won't repeat all that, but I was guessing to very end how things would resolve. The side-stories that involved the main character's book-selling business (after his career as a cop), I found very interesting and learned a few things about the rare book trade."
5,Really great!,"Truly insightful writing about the TRUE nature of TaiJi Quan. A review of the TaiJi classics, and in-depth discussion on Daoism. Truly a MUST-READ for those interested in the higher levels of TaiJi! :o)...and besides, it's cheap..."
3,Could have been better...,"A good film that misses the mark by being too enamored of itself. Making asides to the audience was trite even when the film was made; a rewind (literally) scene simply didn't belong. The latter half of the movie lags quite a bit, due in part to the incredible passivity of the surviving family members. Funny Games is nonetheless a suspenseful film -- but it could have been a lot better had the director relied more on the strength of the story and less on contrived gimmicks."
1,"Dull, dull, dull","No, this really will not do. Does Haneke really think he is contributing anything original or intelligent to the already-hackneyed screen violence debate? Arthouse cinema must try harder than this sort of trite, 'but-real-violence-is-awful' stuff. Worse still, Haneke's insistence on having his characters make asides to the audience is not only patronising; it removes all credibility and reduces the characters to author's mouthpieces about whom we cannot be bothered to care. This is not disturbing or thought-provoking. It is merely smug, suspenseless, hectoring and dull beyond belief."
1,Terrible waste of time,"That was one of the worst films I have ever seen. Not the acting so much as the script. I love the actors, which is why I rented the film, but the story itself is just so terrible. The odd little quirks meant to make it more interesting just made it more unbelievable and ridiculous. Don't waste your time. It's not scary. There is zero suspense. It's just silly."
2,Starts good - gets tiresome,"I was struck by the brutal realism of the first half, but then was highly disappointed by the time it was over. The problem with this movie is as follows: the family that's being terrorized is left with NO options and NO way out. Frankly put, this gets boring. Even if you are a sadist that simply wants to see graphic violence, there's not much of it, and nothing is what I would consider 'graphic'. This movie plays on the terror of a husband, wife, and small child being held captive by two ""psychopaths"", which is VERY scary and disturbing. However, when one of the psychopaths ""rewinds"" the movie to change an outcome, or when he stops to converse with the viewer, I felt the director ruined a perfectly good film to try something ""different"". I condone experimentation and breaking away from the norm, but it does NOT work in this film. Prepare to be disappointed."
4,Creepy!,"This is a psychological thriller and not a slasher film. Virtually bloodless, it gets under your skin as the two protagonist's weave their deception and control against a family, vacationing for the summer. Almost an interactive film, it seduces the viewer into the film itself. Many unnerving parts. You'll never look at eggs the same way. Well acted and directed, this is Austrian horror cinema at it's best."
4,One can only surmise one thing from the reactions to this movie...,"It is a testament to the quality of this movie that such extreme reactions of admiration and despise display themselves on this review page! This movie by and large puts its audience in a very frustrating situation: not having control over the decisions of the characters (from afar) and the sense that the typical rules of story telling are being violated. I have watched this movie with a number of people. It almost always inspires anger from the viewer, which is typically directed toward the film as a work and the film makers! Without spoiling the movie, how the movie makes the audience react is, in fact, the beauty of this movie!"
4,A Disturbing And Unrelenting Film,"I only give this movie 4 stars because it has succeeded where only few movies have. This movie actually disturbed me .This is not an easy thing to do. Anybody who sits down to watch this movie, I will warn you ahead of time, it is very brutal and does not have a happy ending. But it is a powerful and emotionally draining movie."
5,Horrifying,"I don't know whether to give this movie five stars or none. As I watched it through the first time I felt sick at the grotesque horror inflicted by the serial killers. The second time I had to leave before the serial killers even came on the screen I couldn't view the family as happy (esp. the mother) knowing what would become of them. The only way I could describe my feelings during it is to compare it to what I should imagine it would be like to watch be forced to watched someone struggling for life, maybe their drowing and despite their calling for you, you are forced only to sit there and watch.I sat through all sorts of movies others find repulsive such as The Cook, the Thief, his Wife and her Lover or Salo, and though they stirred my emotions it is only that I find I cannot stomach."
2,A thriller for sympathizers of passivity,"although this film tries it's best to be both clever and experimental (the remote control scene would've worked in a different movie) it still misses it's mark in obtaining a plateau ot ""truly disturbing"". the innocents in the film were paper thin, uncannily passive, and totally unbelievable. the evil pair are quirky but are absurdly thrown together characters that never actually feel threatening. maybe one day there will be a remake. this could have been a contender"
2,Way off,"Usually I read the reviews of IMDB and amazon.com before I even consider buying a movie. 98% of the time they have been on point. This case however was the 2% where they weren't. I was expecting to see the most hard to watch movie of all time. Give me a break. This movie was so boring that I couldnt even finish watching it. The acting was good, the plot was decent but the rest of the content of the movie was highly overrated and very disappointing. If anyone else is going to watch this. Watch it with a CLEAR mind. Dont go into the movie thinking it will be some horror masterpiece like I did because like me, you will be disappointed too"
1,German Nihilism,"This film seems to have no message, except the absurdity of unmotivated violence. In that regard, there is nothing original here."
4,Love it or hate it.,"This film will interact with you. Personally I loved it. It's gripping and original. It is not a simple snuff film. Haneke knows all too well how to direct and edit. Watch it, because it will make you feel, and that's pretty rare in modern filmmaking."
4,Chilling...Numbing...,"Very good movie if you like ""this type of thing""! Not bloody gory at all but, not for the faint hearted. Psychologically compelling, yet grim...very very grim! Subtitles kinda suck but, you get used to it."
1,Cold. Emotionless. Meaningless.,"This tragedy deserves only a cursory review:A literalist's nightmare of absolute sadism in a raw, vacuous form. As another reviewer stated, this sadistic film appears to have the same intentions as a snuff film. If you can actually sit through the two hours of this relentless sadism and walk away thinking, 'I really enjoyed this film,' you need serious psychological help.Cold. Emotionless. Meaningless."
1,This is Garbage. It's just a Snuff Film,Please don't waste your time with this garbage. Someone told me it was a good movie and I kept expecting some interesting twist but it's just horror porn. It has no redeeming qualities. You might as well be watching a snuff film.
3,Definitely Different,"Could be satire, could be black comedy, could be lots of things. The film, however, is not a horror film, as some have said, nor is it gory (there's more violence in some cartoons), as others have said. It's the IDEA of violence that makes this so repugnant yet fascinating at the same time. Characters have no redeeming values whatever, and you learn to hate them with a passion early on. And the film remains relentless and frustrating, and stays with you. The only flaw: The ""did the disc jam?"" real-time segment went on too long. You'll know it when you see it."
4,Truly incredible!,"I turned on the movie without knowing anything about it-- so I was astonished at how events deteriorated from the innocent and funny initial scenes. From there, the film sinks into a very deep pit of horror, and it just keeps getting worse. I found myself feeling completely outraged-- even offended-- by the movie, and yet I could not turn it off. The whole experience of watching it was deeply unpleasant-- worse than any horror movie I've seen-- and yet... well... it's a damn-good film! I realized afterward that I was a victim of clever manipulation-- that the filmmaker was deliberately pressing these buttons in me. In that case, he gets an A+ for accomplishing his mission. But then one may question the value of pushing these buttons in the first place. Is it a comment on film & TV violence in general?"
1,oh. my. god.,"s:no.no....no.m:this raging POS could not possibly result in entertainment. i only finished watching this because i wanted to get my 3 dollars worth. you can't possibly justify watching this. if it were good, i would say it was good. this is not good. it is bad. pretentious. and bad. you can watch it. i am sure you have your reasons. but i hope you feel as cheated as i do. good day sir. i dare you to explore the ""meaning"" of terror, torture, and callous brutality in the most boring way imaginable. seriously, go ahead. intellectualized violence is like processed fruit. or like watching the act of toe nail clipping: visceral, but boring. i said good day!"
1,Terrible,This is one of the most terrible films I have ever seen. It is awful in its violence and at times the unspoken is even more dreadful. Basically these guys go on a rampage of killing yet there is never an explination why. They seem to just kill and torture for the fun of it. The acting is good but at times hollow and not a realistic depiction of fright. Basically it is a flim that should have never been made and would be better left in the box. If you are a serial killer or death is your thing then you might enjoy it. Otherwise take my advice and stay away. It reminds me why European cinema does not work in the U.S. We want tidy endings or at least to understand. This film provides none of that.
2,C'mon people,"Ok, first off who cares about ""socially redeeming values"", and the such....All of the people who rate this low because of it's brutal nature shouldn't even be allowed to review here. The concept of the movie is sick and brutal, but that does not make a movie bad.That being said, I'll get to my point. Yes the idea for this movie is quite good, and at times the flick rolls along nicely. The problem? It drags on. It is not very well put together, and the stupid ""remote control"" scene is completely unneccesary. In fact, I found myself watching some of the movie on 2X mode, and reading the subtitles just to get it moving. And yeah, the 5-10 minute ""real time"" scene is unnecesary. The movie is worth renting if you are fans of twisted movies, but i certainly WOULD NOT recommend plunking down cash to own this. IT has it's moments yes, but it couold have been done so much better. Instead, you find yourself yawning thru much of the thing."
3,"Pleased me, but not at all","After i read most of the reviews posted here i felt some ""curious"" about this movie, so i decided to bought it, then it arrives and i felt a little scary to see it, at last i watch it and i find that is a ""new breed"" of thriller, not shocking at all, to be realistic i was expecting something more disturbing after what i read, but its a good movie you can watch it and go to the bed without nightmares or something like that.Good movie, good performances, remote control scene [is bad], too much still camera footage, in average i think 3 stars it's the right ranking, nice effort Haneke! it entertains me for a while."
4,Don't read the low rated reviews-they'll kill any surprise!!,"The English subtitles CANNOT be removed!! Just thought I'd warn you-could be irritating if you know German.I just watched this video and wanted to add that missing info. Then I decided to read through the other reviews. Pretty apalling how so many people want to give away everything. Unless you hate surprises, only read the reviews with high ""helpful to you ratings""-most of them were decent enough not to spoil everything. (But don't read too many of them.) I enjoyed this DVD. Not the usual hostage flick with extremely stupid victims. Seemed hard to watch at first, but that feeling went away. If you want dumb and predictable, get one of those brain dead Halloween flicks..."
3,disturbing and full of unease,"I wanted to see the original 1997 Austrian film before I watched the recent Hollywood remake. Now, I'm not sure I'll be watching the remake.I can't figure out if I liked the ""movie-like"" insertion into the plot or if I would've preferred the more straight-forward storytelling. The viewer is transported into the story somewhat, but besides giving the said viewer an uneasy feeling (very similar to the way Kurt Vonnegut's insertion of himself inSlaughterhouse-Five: A Novelmade me feel), I'm not sure what exactly this accomplishes.I understand the director's point about violence and the viewer's complicity of it, I'm just not sure that I buy into this film's expression of this point.The film's strongest parts rely on the scenes that have the characters dealing with their predicament, grief, and loss."
5,MacGregor B90 Pro Batting Helmet (EA),I was expecting a different color but the helmet matched the bat so well I am glad it was a different color
2,Not strong enough to support a laptop PC,"I bought this one and hoped for more. After a month I gave it to a friend who thought he can use it in his car. Same old same, he gave up as well. It is badly designed will not support the weight of a laptop in a moving car."
5,Great starting up program,"I think Peggy Brill is ""brilliant"". This program is a great mix of information about your body, simple straighforward exericise you can modify and start with less reps if you need to as well as exerices to advance to so you don't feel that it only is good at one stage of your program. I have back issues and just reviewed the McKenzie book on his exericse which Peggy Brill also has incorporated in her program with just enough reps to get the benefit. Highly reccomend this book for others with musculo-skel issues to get started on Core strength."
5,The core program,"Great book. I have been searching for a resource that gives a balanced fitness routine. The book gives well explained instructions and varying degrees of difficulty so anyone can get started without feeling sore and intimidated. I also really like the explanations about why our bodies may be causing pain and how the program affects joints, muscles and overall mobility. I felt more energetic and less muscle soreness within a week of doing the program. Thanks Peggy."
5,The Core Fifteen Minutes that CanChange your Life,Very good. I want a DVD as it is hard to read and then perform the exercise.
4,Good exercise,"This book's photos and explanations make the exercises easy to do, and the motivation is also well explained in terms of the health benefits of each."
2,did not meet my expectations,"I was expecting more from this title and in particular, with the author being a PT. I am a PT and thought it was lacking."
5,For all those people who thought they could never exercise,I bought this book last November and read it through completely. I also performed the basic tests that determine each person's level of fitness. This week I finally got around to starting the actual Core Program and I can't believe how good I feel after each session. The most appealing thing about the program is that you don't have to be young and fit to do it and it's designed particularly for women. I have experienced immediate relief of hip pain and discovered that some of the strength building exercises I had been doing with hand held weights are not good for me. This book is really life changing. I wish she would make a tape!
2,Be careful!!,"This may be a good book, but I highly recommend anyone experiencing health problems consult with a professional before going directly to a book. I tried using this book after having some back problems. After trying the excercises for almost a week my back pain became so severe I could not walk. My husband had to carry me to the clinic. My doctor had to shoot drugs into me at the clinic because I was fainting onto the floor from the pain. She said to stop those exercises immediately. I also spoke to a physical therapist and a naturopath and all were horrified at recommending anyone doing ""the Cobra"" without direct observation (I think it was that stretch that disabled me). I am worse off then when I started.So, please be careful becfore using these excercises without talking to a professional first and making sure you are doing them properly. I am only 34 years old and and went through childbirth 2 years ago with no painkillers. I can usually handle pain, but this was unreal."
3,"Good album, but...","Some people may find the lyrics of the track ""Mary"" to be very offensive, especially if you are a Catholic."
4,good product,"i wish this was not so expensive, but it is important for those who cannot eat and need nutrition. Good thag it is easy to get"
2,okay,"plate, saucer, bowl, and bread&butter; dish was in good condition BUT thecup was broken. so thats it."
5,Best blanket I've found,"I loved this blanket so much, I ordered several more. They are the best swaddling blanket I've found (plenty of fabric to work with and great instructions right on the tag). They are also a great all-purpose blanket (covering the car seat in bad weather, on a floor to sit and play, etc.). Can't say enough good things about it. Even my kids' pediatrician asked about it so she could recommend it to her other patients."
4,Alot for very little,"This subwoofer can put out some bass....I have a very big family room with wall to wall fuzzy carpet (I didn't pick it), long drapes, book cases....in other words: the room kills sound. This speaker can make the whole place shake. It has been a great addition to my DVD surround sound.More seriously, it probably isn't the finest piece of equipment around, but it is alot of speaker for very little money. Plus free shipping, and it is hard to think of a downside."
3,Power box!,"Wow, this monster shakes the house. It don't last very long as it has connection problems from the vibrations but the quality is great. I suggest you don't put his thing out of reach since you have to reconnect it ever so often. Thats when using the RCA connections. Otherwise it's a nice addition to your home sound system."
3,Good while it lasted,For the price point I enjoyed excellent bass reproduction for three years but then it just died a few weeks ago--would no longer power up--replacing the fuse did not help. A star for each year.
2,Not for low volume use...,"I use this to augment the small speakers attachedto my television. This subwoofer sounds very goodwith clean bass at the moderate volume levels Ilisten to. Unfortunately, it turns itself off atlower volume levels, then I have to turn the TVup louder to get it to come back on. I considerthis a design flaw, thus the two star rating."
2,Not worth it,I know you can't expect much for the price. The bass is so distorted I can barely stand it. Fortunately I bought it mainly for low level listening so it will probably be okay. I wouldn't waste the money again though.
5,Love ths cross !!!,"This cross is beautiful and detailed,it looks like something you would see in a very expensive jewelry store,I love the size of it,i like bigger crosses,i am very happy with it and wear it often and get many compliments on it."
4,Not bad adaptation of the author's own work,"This book is an adaptation of Eleanor Perry's screenplay for Frank Perry's film, ""The Swimmer."" The original short story by John Cheever must have been hard to adapt into a full-length film, but the result made for an interesting movie with Burt Lancaster. This book is a good record of the movie. Doesn't add much, but if you're a fan of the movie, this would be a good book to add to your collection."
2,Kerry Ottoson,"I was very disappointed with the contents of this book. The information presented here can all be found in the readme files on the Embedded XP CD, in the development tool's help files, or on the microsoft website http://msdn.microsoft.com/embedded.If you are looking for details about some of the 10,000 components in the XP Embedded component database, this book does not have anything.If you want all the installation and tool operation information in one place, this book is for you. If you want more in depth information about what the XP embedded components do, save your money."
5,Great book for practical applications,I bought this book hoping to learn DOE using Taguchi Methods and apply what I learned to real life problems in my work. It was very helpful. Not only did it help me learn the methods I needed to perform my testing at work but I did it in only 8 days of reading. The book was very easy to read and the examples helped me understand everything I needed to know to apply this method to real situations. A great buy for anyone looking to learn Taguchi Methods.
2,A software manual with no software included,"This book is little more than a manual for using the included CDROM. Adding insult to injury, the CDROM is only a partially functional demo version of the software explained in the book. (You can't even save your work.) ... If you're only looking to do extremely basic DOE work, this book may suffice, otherwise, look elsewhere."
3,Brief review of DOE using Taguchi approach by R. Roy,"Dr. Roy has been able to translate into everyday language some of the most difficult concepts of the Taguchi methodology. Whereas the book does not provide the reader with much theoretical background, it doeas provide ample examples and practical approaches to the methodology. Excellent sections are the discussions about the OAs and the modified arrays as well as the ANOVA. The references to the CD ROM are well placed.The shortcomings of the book are the very poor screens from the software package. In fact, in some cases they are unreadable. Another shortcoming is the absence of any discussion of tolerance design using the Taguchi methodology.Overall: a good book for reference."
1,"Tired, immature, and completely ill-prepared","This booklet is nothing more than someone who lacks the insight to really understand the cultural, political, and spiritual aspects of black hair and hairlocking. HAIRLOCKING IS NOT A FAD! We have to explore why OUR people are afraid of wearing afros, cornrows, braids, and locks. The book needed to explore the holistic impact of hairlocking or natural hairstyles in general. This booklet is a signal that more SERIOUS research is needed into our culture BEYOND the Bible, Qur'an, and Torah"
4,Irish History by a Storyteller,"In the tradition of Irish storytellers, this history of Ireland is entertaining and thought-provoking -- and it's an easy read."
3,Malachy McCourt's History of Ireland,It was very good. Lighter than most histories that are more documentary in style. Easy to read and a good background before travelling to Ireland.
4,Great book!,"I bought this for my husband at Christmas and he loved it! He is from Ireland and enjoyed this book, great writing and storytelling!"
5,Just Because,"This item was purchased as a gift which has not yet been presented, however I have read much, if not all of Malachy's works and am confident that ""History ....."" is deserving of the 5 stars that I give ....."
1,Save your money.,"The author unintentionally wrote an accurate summation of his book in his section on James Joyce: ""It is difficult to state here what Joyce did for modern literature-that is a job for men much more capable that I"". The book might be subtitled ""The English think they're better than us but they're not"". Did he intentionally misnomer the famous Irish barrister Edward Carson as Edmond Carson? One supposes he did, because Carson was a Unionist and McCourt obviously doesn't like Unionists. I bet he spends a lot of time challenging them to knock the chip off of his shoulder."
1,Choose it to become depressed,Complete and total downer of a movie. Don't make the mistake I made wasting time with it. Only use this film has is to drive a potential suicide over the edge.
1,Bad!,"Eight minutes was all I could stand of pointless conversation from a dysfunctional family, children with drug problems and bully aunts, drunk uncles. Don't waste your money. There was nothing at the beginning to compel one to continue to watch."
4,It Has Its Purpose,"This booklet published before the Rolling Stones release Bridges To Babylon serves the purpose of outling each of the Rolling Stones songs and a summary of their recordings. A very detailed description of each track is given. Helpful for those debating whether to purchase a particular recording. Yes, there are some slight biases. However, the author does not make his opinion too overbearing. A nice pocket size booklet for Rolling Stones fans."
3,Informative but opinionated,"This book should really be titled ""The Complete Guide to One Man's Opinion of the Rolling Stones."" Granted, you can hardly expect someone to discuss all the Stones' records without having some opinion; however, Hector's tone is fairly pretentious and almost always snobbish. Worth reading for hard-core Stones fans, but the Appleford book is much more detailed, and it isn't so painfully clear how hard the writer is trying to impress you with his critical voice.(As you may have guessed, I disagreed with about 50 percent of what this guy wrote.)"
3,"Cute, run of the mill western.","The plot is pretty basic stuff. Innocent girl runs after army lieuteant who took her innocence and left her pregnant, only to find he's engaged to another. However the angst driven army scout marries red headed, fiesty Flame to give the child a name. The rest of the story is fighting the indians. A lot of hot sex ensues in this supposed marriage of convenience. The story's saving grace is that the characters are wonderful and very real as are the secondary characters. The dialogue is also enjoyable. Although a neat read it's not a keeper. Trilogy includes books on sister Raven (black haired), and sister Angel (blonde)"
3,"Too much fluff, not enough photos","The coverage needs more photos. A couple of hummingbirds at my Tucson AZ feeder don't seem to match those shown in the book. So, I'll have to buy another book for the purpose I needed: Identification. Just about half of the book addresses plants to attract the birds and other such information."
5,A beautifully photographed hummingbird guide.,"When I bought this three years ago I was in the process of learning how to photograph hummingbirds in my backyard. It has a chapter on Photographing Hummingbirds which was just what I was looking for. They explain how to take photos of the birds which produce nice sharp wings rather than the blurred, sometimes nonexistent ones that I was getting. The Stokes use quite a number of stunning photos, diagrams, charts, maps and succinct text to provide the reader information on the important topics. I have quite a few books on hummingbirds but this is the one I use the most. Excellent guide.Barbara KurtzAuthor of A Hummingbird's Story: How I Came to Be (a childrens book for all ages)"
3,Nice Book,I purchased this book as a present and my mother really enjoys it. The pictures are sharp and clear and the information is good.
5,Hummingbird Book,What a delightful book. We have read it cover to cover and instituted some of its recommendations. Can't wait until spring when our little buddies return.
3,It's a toy train,"When train got delivered set was missing wire from control box to track making it unusuable. I contacted Creative Toys & Hobbies customer service and they eventually found one for me, but they couldn't get it till after Christmas. I believe the Customer Service rep's name was Josh. I also believe he went beyond what I would call normal customer service to try and get me this part. To the point that he took a picture of the cable and e-mailed it to me to be sure it was the correct item. The Bachmann Thomas train set was to say the least fair quality. I serves it's need for a 6 yr old. I would buy again from Creative Toys & Hobbies I like their attitude."
1,Total waste of money,The website was misleading. It only lasted my son 3 hours. The site did not inform us that the train should not run for a one hour non stop. Pure nonsense. How do you tell a kid who loves a train to run it for 10 minutes per day and then turn it off till the next day. This product is pure rubbish.
5,my 5 year old grandson received this toy for Christmas and he enjoyed it very much,my 5 year old grandson received this train for Christmas and he has enjoyed it very much. I would recommend this for any child two and over.
1,Unsatisfactory,The charger did not work so my son could not use.? It was $100.00 wasted . I need a replacement charger.
4,Ho Train is really fun!,This is a return to and earlier liking of Thomas the train. See:[...]Thank you Amazon for helping regain my love for trains!On behalf of Marty Jr. (his Dad)
3,fine first train,"The Thomas train set certainly found favor with its six year old recipient. While the plastic quality and long-term durability are less than encouraging, it's a great way for a child to learn about maintaining transformers, being safe around electricity, being careful with a model or toy railroad, etc. If this is the deluxe set, however, one must wonder about the regular set: one oval of track, one engine, two carriages, an oversized Sir Topham Hatt, bus and helicopter."
3,cute,Cute shoes; different fabric- makes them more casual. Pointy toe so kind of uncomfortable. I don't wear these much.
1,Put this series out to pasture!,"This series has been getting more pathetic for years now. In the beginning they were a fun read, but now are a sheer waste of paper."
1,Do people ever act like this?,"This is the first book I have written by Ms. Daheim, so I may not know the characters well enough to understand why they would act like this. The fact that a woman would stake-out a house, interview the milkman (where are there milkmen anymore?), the mailman and the delivery man makes Judith sound demented. Then she parks her car and spies on the house from the bushes and is coincidently there when the package which arrives ONCE a year is delivered--WHAT? THEN she and her cousin go in and talk to one of the residents just because they want to--I couldn't take any more. I like more motivation for actions. I like SOME small amount of motivation other than, ""I'm interested"" before a heroine stalks and harrasses people."
2,Ok graphics but thats it,"There is no way to save your game, you only get 3 lives and an extra one every 4 levels or so. With 30 levels being advertised, you gotta be really good to get there....very discouraging/boring to always have to start back at 1st level"
5,Love the piece of mind provided by this product.,Great way to secure your protect your investment. Works great and is well made. Only down side is the price.
5,Yum! Gimme more...,"From the king of jelly beans, these are great! If you love coconut like I do, you will like these too."
2,I wouldn't buy this product again!,"My review on this is not based on actually trying the product and this is because the bag it came in looks like a regular goody bag which they just attached their packing labels on, which usually wouldn't bother me, but it was sealed with red tape! I just like my products to be sealed more professionally! =/"
5,Cats Pillow Case,"The product was exactly as shown, fast delivery, would recommend this seller to anyone.Thank you"
1,Drive Dead after 2 months--all data lost,"Horrible drive. Steer clear, of this product...it is unreliable. The drive is unreadable and all my pictures and video are now lost. I wish I could sue these junk manufacturers for all the time they caused me to flush down the toilet. All the hours would come out to thousands of dollars. Rediculous and very disappointing."
5,Western Digital WD5000KSRTL/WD5000AAKS Caviar 500 GB SATA Hard Drive,I like the large capacity hard drive and very good reboluciones per second have been satisfied with the purchase of Western Digital Caviar 500 GB SATA WD5000KSRTL/WD5000AAKS Hard Drive
3,good 4.... 3 yrs,needed to repair with vista disk at 3 yearscould not repair smart error six months later.replaced with seagate st31000524asOS loaded in a fraction of the time I remember it took for the WDI think 32M on the seagate helps plus the tweeks in design in 3 yrs
3,Warranty was needed.,"My computer is up and running 7 days a week, 10-14 hrs a day. This drive died 1/10/11. WD quickly sent a new one under warranty, and the old one is on it's way back. Never had a WD drive go that fast."
3,OK for the money and 3 yr warranty,"For music, videos in news websites/business articles, or poker games I usually leave my speaker on ""all the time.""well, what is ANNOYING is that, there is this ""clicking sound"" anytime pages are flipped (like reading ads page to page) and the ONLY Solution is to turnoff the speaker.do yourself a favor -- spend a few more dollars for the 500gb Caviar Black 32mb cache WD5001AALS [mine does not have this annoying clicking sound...] and also get the 5-year warranty!"
4,drive review,Works as it should. All necessary parts there. A SATA cable would have been nice to include though.
5,Hard drive replacement,"The western digital drive is working good. my first large drive was a WD, it was 8gb, lasted forever so I usually trust this one at least for as long as any drive, but they are sideways so that hurts it, but not the drives fault, that's the set up Dell does."
5,Shhhhhhhhhhhh....,"Not only is this drive much faster than my old IDE drive with 8M cache, it is as quiet as can be. In fact, if I didn't see my screen updating, I'd think the drive was dead it's so quiet! It's almost night and day the difference in noise!!!"
2,Replaced 4 of 4 < 1 year,"WD replaced first with WD5000AAKS, second replacement, WD5000KS.. Be sure to register your drives with WD when you get them. One remaining drive (not replacement) making recurrent sound of winding down but no obvious performance problems. Ran WD boot CD diagnostics (short version) on each drive before 2nd drive went bad but nothing showed up. 22-JAN-08 number 3 died today. Still have noise. Mar-08 4th and last drive died. Replacement noiser than ever. Noticed these replacements are ""recertified"". No more Western Digital for me."
5,Fast and Great Hard-Drive,"I bought this hard-drive to replace an older 160GB that was failing. This 500GB Western Digital works Perfect with Windows Vista Ultimate, I say this because I am using it right now. I can Multi-Task with No Problems at all! I listen to my Big iTunes - what I call my jute box music player, I have two Browsers running and a online game running, and this hard-drive keeps up with everything Great! Plus this is the Quietest hard-drive I ever owned!My System is a Dual Core Pentium D 2.8Ghz and I have 2GB RAM. I use a Diamond Viper X1950 PRO ATI Radeon 512MB video card."
1,Will not buy a WD bare drive again,"Trouble started the day the Wdigital Bare Drive came home. I was eager to feed it with all the critical data and foolishly did so. Suddenly, one day out of the blue (after 11 months of use) the drive stopped being readable. Lost lot of important data that cannot be retrieved and I tried every thing possible to retrieve it. The formatting was not easy either. My Windows Vista machine would not recognize it. Tried several times before moving it to my Windows 7 and it worked after 3 attempts. A scan revealed that my drive also has bad sector problems. My usually fast Windows 7 OS machine has slowed down.There were read errors too. The droning sound that this hard drive makes does not allow me to concentrate on my work. There are no cables included in this package. I will not buy a WD product again and would not recommend it to others."
2,Just died 5 months out of warranty,"Drives fail. I know that. Was using this along with a 500GB Maxtor in a 1TB RAID0 array, with a nice cool fan, I might add. It is amazing to me that we accept such short warranty periods for modern hard drives. Their ""Customer Loyalty Program"" Will offer to sell me a new drive for $97. You must be joking! I'm going to buy a Seagate with a 5 year warranty and upgrade to a RAID5 array so that next time a drive fails I have redundancy."
1,Will never buy WD again,Paid $116 for this hard drive in March of 2008. August of 2009 it is dead in the water. This is the third WD hard drive that has failed in under 2 years. WD would not replace under warranty. My other hardware checks out fine. Definitely a HD failure. So long WD!
1,Stops working as soon as warranty is over.,"Bought this in July 07 when it had only a year warranty on them, They change to a three year in Aug 07. Mine died at christmas so there is no warranty. Only is I had know I would of waited another month for the extra 2 years. Must be why I got a great price on this paper weight back then."
2,Very early drive failure,"Have less than 1 year old HP desktop which came with two of these drives which I configured in a RAID1 array. Thank god for that! One drive failed after about 3 months since I live in Bermuda where warranty for stuff bought in the US is more pain than it's worth, I just bought this drive as a replacement in Nov 2009. That drive has now failed as well giving it a life span of less than 3 months. Again the RAID1 array has saved my data (and I back up too!) My desktop is not heavily used, so this drive should not have been taking any abnormal beating.If you are looking for a new (not replacement drive) I would recommend looking at a different drive. I work with in IT with Windows servers and desktops and this failure rate is abnormal in my experience with over 1000 desktops and servers."
2,Failed Drive,"Drive did not work right out of the box. Should have never used it since it caused trouble from the start and took a few tries to get it to work properly and be recognized by the hardware. Now it has failed again and I'm working through the exchange process. I bought 2, one worked, one didn't."
2,"NOT the retail version with cable, software, etc.",I have not even installed this yet and I'm angry already. I've had good experiences with WD drives so I expect this one will be fine. What I'm NOT fine with is the fact that the retail package does NOT come with the cable and utility software. I could have bought the OEM version cheaper elsewhere.
5,excellent!,one of my favorite bands of all time and its a full length album.. no half songs on this one..
4,Nice Syringes,"I haven't bought these here, but I know they're the same syringes my vet gives me to treat my rats with! Lately I've been treating them myself more so I don't have to spend money at the vet when I know they're just suffering from a myco flare-up and possible secondary infection (using amoxicillin and enrofloxyn 10%), and so I've been using this syringe to administer the enrofloxyn which needs more precise measurements than the amoxicillin. They're very easy to use, draw easily, and have precise measurements. The only complaint I have is that the numbers begin to wear off after a while... so, I plan to buy one of these boxes at some point to replace the few I have left! It's not a huge inconvenience though, since it tends to wear off at the top where I grip and my rats never exceed 0.3 mL of medication."
5,Open ended syringes made giving our cat his cortizone so much easier,"We bought a box of these syringes at a very reasonable price. I think they may have cost us five or ten cents each. If I had bought them individually at retail stores, they were going to cost me about $2.00 a piece. The quality was also every bit as good as the ones we had been buying for a couple of bucks. Any time you need to give your cats or perhaps smaller dogs medicine orally in a liquid this is a very good way to go. We have tried it by hand and it often ended up with getting our fingers bit or clawed and our cats very upset. This was just so much easier. We found that we needed to change the syringes about every three or four uses because the action started to get difficult. We also wanted to make sure they stayed clean for our cats. It gets more difficult to clean them out the longer we used them. Buying these enabled us to change syringes frequently because the cost was so reasonable."
3,Not too bad,"My son was so excited to get this toy. He bought it with his birthday money. He loved the lava scene but became bored very quickly. There's not a lot of different things to do with it. He still likes it, but I thought it was a little expensive for the amount of time he plays with it. Luckily, it included 2 action figures, so I don't feel so bad!"
3,My granddaugher loved it!,My granddaughter wanted a play space for her female warriors. She was very happy with the Mustafar playset I bought for her birhtday. She is 6 years old.
3,same old,"this is a nice toy. all the problems nd nice things have been pointed out by the other customers, but there is 1 thing i want to say. i wish they had the platform that obi and anikan fight on thats moving. u know that hovering cart thingy? i wish they had that and that it was on a stick or something that revoled around the playset. o well, to freakin' bad."
2,broke,"The grills broke and fell off. So much for quality. Even though they were inexpensive, I didn't expect them to spontaneously fall apart. They sound OK for rear speakers in a 5.1 theatre system."
5,"Beautiful, heavy plates","Love these plates. It is very hard to find nice, classy-looking dinnerware with cats on it. (I am a cat nut, and I am constantly on the lookout for cat housewares). These are salad plates, but work well for small meals."
1,Inferior pear vinegar,"This pear vinegar is based in white wine vinegar. It is far inferior to pear vinegars which are based in balsamic vinegar. You can get the latter type at Whole Foods Market, or try Sparrow Lane, which markets a fine pear vinegar. I tried this vinegar in a salad dressing recipe I have often used, and the result was markedly inferior."
3,Interesting? I suppose. Necessary? Definitely not.,"It was bound to happen. Culling sixty-odd factions down to fifteen can only keep things under control for so long. The Lady of Pain herself cannot (or will not) keep the factions from each other's throats forever. Anyone who finds the idea of the factions fighting each other as they do with sneakiness, subterfuge, and generally dirty deeds done when no one's looking will probably not like this book. The idea of the factions in all-out war with each other sounds exciting, but in the long run the status quo is more fulfilling. Faction War presents some changes to the Planescape campaign setting which I feel do not serve any particular purpose. The campaign is too relatively new to need something like this. DMs running lower-level campaigns be warned: you may have to water things down to accomodate your characters. Faction War is interesting overall, but essentially unnecessary. In short, The Great Modron March it ain't."
3,Interesting? Yes. Necessary? No.,"This book deals with what happens when an overachieving factol goes too far. It changes Sigil drastically; anyone who enjoys the factional intrigues of Sigil probably won't like these changes. This book does have some good higer-level adventures in it, but DM be warned: you'll have to water things down significanly for lower-level adventurers (example: a goristro tanar'ri running amuck in the Lower Ward.) Admittedly, Faction War does make for some good reading, and at least it explains who wrote The Factol's Manifesto. However, I do not understand why TSR felt compelled to shake things up in Planescape this soon (comparatively) after introducing the campaign setting. In short, don't bother with this book if you like the status quo in Sigil. Faction War is a decent book overall, but Modron March it ain't."
5,It is a shallow review indeed which trashes this classic,"I found it quite disappointing reading many of the reviews on this sight in that they TOTALLY ignored the content of this adventure, choosing instead to whine about its changed to their precious campaign setting. While Sigil was cool beforehand, the ending opens more doors than it closes. This advenure has a solid plotline, one of the most intriguing character developments in Duke Rowan Darkwood, and the coolest twists and turns that no one can anticipate. Yes, it does change Sigil forever, but the rest of the cosmos are not much affected. My only recommendation is that a dm run it for much higher levels than recommended, allowing PCs to experience Sigil as is first. Then after all the other adventures are played to hit this one. The adventure is much more focused on roleplay than hack-and-slash, and the encounters are easily customizable for higher levels. All in all, a good adventure for those deep enough to appreciate it."
3,Disappointed,The book was not as interesting as I had expected. I have the CD of the movie's music and loved it. Guess I thought the story would be as good as the music. Have looked for a DVD but can't find it.
5,The Choir,The Choir is a warm and welcoming book about human relations which a shows just how beautiful are our relationships with God. I was impressed with the depth and understanding of this marvelously well-written book and am proud to call it one of my favorite books.
2,Am I the only one who noticed?,"How could a female writer in the 20th century COMPLETELY ignore the issue of girls being banned from top choirs in England? Quite a bit is made in this book about how choirs are not ""elitist"", but absolutely nothing is said about how sexist they are. Don't talk to me about ""tradition"". Choirs are part of worshipping God, and God's tradition of creating both male and female singing voices is far older than the human construct of English choirs."
1,change for the worse!!!!,"The blend of this mocha java harrar has completely changed since 2007. For Years I have drunk this blend from coffee masters, ordering usually 8 x 12oz packages at a time . It was high in complex flavors, mellow, soft, mouth coating, low acid, with a faint background of chocolate, and low in bitterness, wonderful after taste -- Outstanding in anyone's book.The previous 8 packages (somewhat stale- from age?) and the most recent 4 packages I received are a completely different coffee!!!!!Very little flavor -single flavored/no complexity, medium to high bitterness, bright-not mellow, tinny and high acid - like columbian blends!!AND the cost is up 30%-50%. Coffee Masters should apologize to coffee drinkers and explain why they would sell a different blend under the same name."
4,the image for this item is wrong,"FYI: The photo shown for this item is wrong. The photo shows the Newhart show from the 80s with Mary Frann and the Stratford Inn (incredibly terrific show!). The item in this listing is actually for the Bob Newhart show from the 70s, also a good show."
1,dissatisfied,"I recently purchased this item, FIRST, I was sent the wrong item (a totally different movie)... I had to go through the hassle of re-packing it. the movie was then replaced. When I got the other movie, it NEVER WORKED IN MY VCR. I kept getting the error message: CANNOT read this type of disc. I got so mad I threw it away and never bothered to send it back. TOO INCONVENIENT...I'M VERY DISSATISFIED...."
2,dvd,"it is very poor info on that dvd ! need more recepies ! I am a cook myself not a dvd colector , therefore I need dvd-s with more recepies on it !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I have two book from Lidia with over 300 recepies , and I need those on dvd !"
3,Missed the TRAVEL!,"I'm a big fan of the show. But disapointed that the ""travel segment "" was edited out of the DVD. Too bad...I'm bumbed Lidia!Johnjuan Giovanni"
4,DVD cookbook,"This is a good way for novice cooks to see how to make the recipes. They are good recipes, as well. It's your chance to cook with one of the tv stars."
1,"several things worse than average, even for a TJB knockoff!","It may be by ""various artists"", but WHICH various artists? There's absolutely no information on the artists (or the recording years) on the CD! There's just the one sided card (the picture you see above) as the insert ... . Most of the tracks seem done by one group that's totally instrumental, the last couple tracks by one that uses a vocal chorus. Most of the tracks sound fine technically, but the last track sounds HORRIBLY muffled as if transferred from a 42nd generation tape copy. If you're not going to care what artists you put on a disk, why use such a horribly mangled track, Madacy??? And finally, all the tracks are rather lacking in inspiration. If you want a Tijuana Brass knockoff on CD with at least SOME redeeming values, search out one of the 4 Mexicali Brass CDs instead."
3,Small Group Com,"The book was delievered in a fairly timely fashion, however there was alot of water damage to the book that was not mentioned in the sales pitch."
3,"This is a controversial album, not my favorite",This album is an special release as it comes with a DVD as well as the audio CD. (Hard to find)
3,Bernie in TO,"Does anyone really need this disc? As an avid fan for 30 years or more and possesing most of the catalogue it is disheartening to find ol' Neil putting out a purely redundant disc such as this. There is nothing remotely ""raw"" here, just a background vocals stripped version of the original recording. True, the more austere sound here makes for a more personal, vunerable listen than the original. But it is not the raw we expect from ol' Shakey. Raw is Mirrorball, raw is Baby What You Want Me To Do, that old Jimmy Reed tune that fills out Broken Arrow. ""Raw"" is a case of misleading advertising, pure and simple. His fans deserve better."
1,Not my choice of Neil!!!,"This is solely a CD to make a statement for the politically advanced. I love everything about Neils music, except this CD! It is not my thing. He had a mission to state how he felt. I think it should have been said at rallys and his concerts, it should have never been recorded and sold to his fans, because it really is not what we wanted to here!"
5,A sleeper in 2005?,"I found out about these guys on a whim by checking out the Change of Pace review on this site, and boy am I glad I checked out the album. Its kind of hard to categorize their sound, other than to say they blend hardcore and (at times) metal with the edgy percussion of great punk rock bands. The choruses and breakdowns are melodic for the most part, but they do get really heavy in ways you really never thought possible (just listening to the opening verse on ""Preamble"" almost made my jaw drop). Its hard to imagine that these guys aren't really big just yet, but give this album a few months and I'm sure it will pick up. If you're into Glassjaw, Beloved, Secret Lives..., Candiria, Haste, Underoath, or Thrice- definitely check these guys out, you won't be disappointed. My picks are: ""Preamble"", 'Reused Decision' and ""In a Name""."
5,Stunning debut lp,"This is definitely one of the best albums i have heard in the last year. Screamo / emo / hardcore hybrid bands have infested the scene like a cancer, and about 5% of them actually have enough talent to get a record deal. Hand to hand go above and beyond the norms for such bands, with soaring melodies and truly crushing 'breakdowns'. I have put 'breakdowns' in inverted commas because they aren't your typical simple hardcore breakdowns; some of the guitar arrangements are pretty amazing. Standout tracks are 'preamble', 'the arson', 'a silver medal', and 'in a name'. It doesn't matter what kind of heavy music you are in to, you will appreciate the clean vocals and musicianship on 'a perfect way to say goodbye'. Get it now, it may just change your life."
3,Greek Lives,"Interesting bios of Greek historical figures. Enjoyed learning more about Alexander, Lycurgus and Alcibiates. Others were not as exciting. Would have helped to have a bit more background on Greek history before listening to this book."
3,Pretty but not realistic looking,I bought this necklace to wear on my wedding day and it just didn't quite work for me. I think the 3 dangles on the bottom are just a bit too much and make the whole thing unrealistic looking.
3,Umm Mighht be good>?,"My wife loved the gift however the watch stopped and took it in to get it fixed and the company would not fix it without a recite. The internet recite was not good enough, mind you it was over seas when I tried this."
5,two great albums,"Both these albums are really special. Other people here cover the band's history, so I won't.The first album is progressive folk-jazz. Tightly written songs, unusual changes, and really good accustic guitar playing. The songs are 3-4 minutes, but with lots of interesting twists and turns. Just listen to ""Time for bed."" the changes are jazzy, but the guitar player almost gets into bluegrass picking. If the Kinks at the time had a few more chops, I could see them trying something like this.The second album is darker, dense with strings. It almost reminds me of what Elton John was doing with Madman Across The Water, but heavier. You could also compair it to early Bee Gees-both bands had the same producer-but the arrrangements are far more complicated.Key is that Cressida never lost focus of the song, like a lot of prog bands did. Their writting is excellent, and bridges the gap between prog and high end pop.Absolutely on the top of my list."
5,An excetional tale.,"An enjoayable first hand account of one of the more interesting missions of World War II. The book has plenty of action while also conveying the feelings of tension, monotony and vulnerability that must have accompanied an extended mission in enemy dominated waters before the GPS age. A must read for anybody interested in WWII naval warfare."
1,The German Raider Atlantis,"A most excellent book and read. This book brings to life the true story of the German merchant raider,Atlantis. She was the most sucessful ship of her class. A freighter equiped with guns like a warship,their cannons hidden behind flaps,she was able to approach closely to Allied merchant vessels without suspicion and order them to heave to or if not, fire upon them. Atlantis captured as prizes or sank many unwary ships in this way. The crews of these ships were treated as fellow seaman and were in fact treated as their own ship mates. All sea worthy prize ships made it back to Germany with the prize crew. The realism and authenticity by far surpasses a book later published by The Naval Institute Press about the Atlantis,which I have read. Captain Rogge's book is by far the best book on the subject to read for realism. First person accounts are always best. Captain Rogge died as a Vizeadmiral in the Bundesmarine. (Federal German Navy}."
3,Other Books,"GURPS Space is one of the many competent supplements for Steve Jackson's Generic Universal Role Playing system.Or, handy when you want to go haring around in spaceships and that sort of fun stuff. Mostly we used it as an adjunct to the other games we were playing at the time, but worth a look."
4,ofgrace.org: Judeo-Christian Book Reviews,"This book by Bevere was a blessing. It edified my Christian walk beyond the circumstance. How To Respond When You Feel Mistreated personified what Christ said about loving our enemies [even when it's a family member] and turning the other cheek [Matthew 5:39]. I constantly put this into practice. I cannot begin to tell you how God is using my newly developed ""unconditional"" love attitude to change not only others, but me too. Talk about lessening stress in one's life."
5,Exchange Your Resentment for Rewards--Do it God's Way,"For such a little book, it certainly packs a powerful punch. No one likes to hear about suffering for righteousness sake in our American culture, but if you're after the Lord's heart, forgiveness and trust in Him are imperatives. Bevere richly explains how to do it right and reap the blessings."
1,Disappointed,"No, this is not a book that I would recommend. It was a very, slow start and was ready to put it down. I continued after reading one review that says that it gets better. But I do not see how a heroine can commit arson that almost caused a death and there be no consequences. Did you say that this was a Christian fiction book? The fiction part, I can believe, the Christian part...not so believable. I will finish the book but am not pleased with the plot."
4,Lovely series,"Found this and #2 by looking for more by this author, and they were a lovely reading experience. Tracie Peterson is one of my favorites!"
5,Good but not Great,The Bells of Lowell series is not my favorite by Tracie. I think it is because I do not really like Judith Miller. This book was very slow in the begining but it got really good in the end. I do not think that this should be the first series by Tracie that you read. All of her other books are wonderful and worth reading.
5,Fits like a glove,"Overall I love the holster. It fits the gun securely and firmly, but is still easy and smooth to draw. I wish the back layer of leather was rough side out, and I wish you could order it with different width belt slots so that you could size it for your carry belt. But even so it's well made, easy to draw, and has good retention. It moves around on my side a little bit. I don't know that that is necessarily a bad thing. Sometimes I move it forward when sitting in my truck so that I could still draw it. The seated in the truck draw would be more awkward than standing, or seated in a chair without arms, but it would still be possible. For more discreet concealability I move it further toward my back and I feel like it prints less there. Very comfortable on a thick gun belt, I couldn't use it at all on my regular casual single-ply dress belt. There just wasn't enough support."
3,"nice holster, but not as snug on belt as you might wish","this holster seems as though the belt holes are a little too large or something, as it seems to slide an sag on my belt much easier than other holsters i own.finish on holster is really nice, but it seems to scratch and buff off a little easier than some.Not a bad holster, but I feel in the line of Galco holsters that I own, this one doesnt seem to be quite as high quality as they usually produce."
5,great holster,my wife and I both have these holster. we are very pleased with them and would highly recomend them to everyone.
5,Perfect Fit,Purchased for my Kimber Pro Raptor II .... Perfect fit .... High Quality >>>> Great Holster for the money. Optics Planet does it right everytime.
5,wowser,"Galco rules, period. You can't find a better quality or manufacturer of holsters around. I am a concealed carry holder and this is nice."
4,Great Game,I bought this game to take along with me for those times that I am sitting and waiting for something. It easily fits in your pocket. It's about the size of a bigger cell phone. The game is great and is fun and keeps you entertained if you're waiting for someone or something. However do not expect to play this game outside and be able to see the screen. That is why I'm giving it a 4 star rating. I've tried to play with it outside and the glare on the screen is so bad that you can't see any of the cards. Now if it's dark outside the back light works great and if it's cloudy you might be able to play with it too. I'm still happy I purchased it. I've dropped it probably 4 times already and it still works fine. I would recommend it.
3,Bicycle Illuminated Touch Screen Solitaire,"Game is small and it is easy to lose the pointer. I do like the lit screen. Even so, it is somewhat difficult to see the cards."
2,value for dollar,"Having spent approx. $4, I think it was worth about that - maybe a little less. It doesn't allow you to see the full line of cards, sometimes it won't allow you to make a legitimate move, and is very poorly lit."
1,Disappointed,"I was very excited to get this game, however, no matter what I set the illumination at, I can bearlly see the screen, not enought to even try playing a game. Hugely disappointed."
4,Lots of fun.,"I have been having so much fun playing this game. I had another Solitaire game that I had for a couple of years and I played it all the time it finally gave out on me, so I got this one to replace it because I would be lost without one. It looks good and is well made. I only gave it four stars because the illumination could be a little brighter. And you will need to turn the light off if the room is really bright with sunlight, and you will need to hold the game at a certain angle to see the cards. The screens contrast really doesn't do much good, I haven't seen any difference when you adjust it, and it doesn't make the cards any darker. That is the only drawback that I can find. The game is a little harder to win than the one I had before. But that makes it more challenging. On the whole it is worth the money."
4,Fun...but,"This hand held solitaire game is fun. The only drawback is it doesn't keep track of high scores, which would have been nice. It also has a ""win"" and a ""game over"" which is suppose to light up. The ""Win"" works, but the ""game over"" has never worked, so I'm never 100% sure whether I had any more possible moves before starting a new game. Other than those things, it does make my bus commute to and from work go faster."
3,cute model,"My grandchildren love this line of Papo miniatures, and enjoy creative play around the concept of castles, kings, princes and princesses, imaginary creatures, and dragons. Since I was able to purchase the figures at a significantly reduced prince, I bought several, which they immediately engaged in dramatic tales."
2,Disappointing!,"(Reviewer:Minionette)If your goal is learning about Cuban cuisine, this isn't the cookbook for it. There are no recipe introductions/descriptions, no traditional menu combinations, and not even an index. I'm also puzzled by the heavy dependence on lard, when olive and vegetable oils were prevalent in the cooking of my extended family and their friends. In fact, olive oil is an important component in the authentic taste of many Cuban dishes, inherited from their southern European origins.For an excellent introduction to the food of Cuba, try <Memories of a Cuban Kitchen>, by Mary Urrutia Randelman. Her recipes invoke the delights of my own mother's kitchen.Here's a 'recipe' for Cuban comfort food from my childhood. Heat a few spoonfuls of olive oil with 1 or 2 crushed cloves of garlic. When the garlic is golden & the oil aromatic, remove the garlic. Immediately drizzle the garlic-infused oil over mashed potatoes. Delectable--& healthier than gravy. Buen provecho!"
4,Works Well With Spoiler,I mistakenly ordered the wrong ones for my vehicle with a spoiler first - these were less expensive and they work very well. No more trying to prop up the trunk with one hand and loading/unloading - then the trunk slamming down. It was sure to break the taillights before long doing that. These seem super stout/strong and even have a little bit of a dampening before they extend all the way up I believe.
5,chuck 4,saison 4 introuvable en france j'ai déjà les saison 1 saison 2 saison 3 et maintenant la saison 4 et bientt la dernière saison 5
5,Chuck season 4,Love this show! Can't believe that it is being cancelled. Sounds like the US TV rating system hasn't moved with technology...
5,Chuck Versus the Push Mix,I purchased this episode and the previous one (Chuck Versus the Gobbler) to watch on my kindle. I really enjoyed watching Chuck. This series will be missed by many. Five years was a good run.
3,"Worth seeing once, not owning!","If you're looking for CHUCK Season 4, then you probably know about what the series was all about. It's okay fun, certainly much better any of those lousy, mindless reality shows. And certainly worth seeing Yvonne Strahovski, one of the most beautiful actress in recent years! Apart from that, not worth paying one penny more than the 40$ for the Blu-ray version."
5,Can't wait for the Blu Ray!,"This is a bit premature since we are still in the middle of season 4, but we record each episode and watch it multiple times. Chuck is one of the few shows that the entire family must watch together, and we have a strange demographic in that there are 3 girls and one guy (me) in our viewing family. I thought Chuck might be a little too ""boy-oriented"" with the beautiful Yvonne Strahovski and Sarah Lancaster, but the ladies in the family love the entire cast and absolutely swoon over Zachary Levi, Adam Baldwin and Ryan McPartlin. The episodes might stretch reality a bit, but are great fun. One reviewer said that Chuck did not fit into a contemporary television genre while I would suggest that Chuck might be described as a cross between Charlie's Angels (which is spoofed in a Season 4 episode) and Get Smart. With the stunning cast members, HD and Blu Ray are the best ways to enjoy Chuck."
4,perfect,"If you're not aware of the series CHUCK, it's agreat mixture of comedy and action.Give it a shot."
4,entertaining,This show works for me... It's light hearted and goofy but has the right balance of light and sincere that makes it work for me. Some of the violence is overdone in my opinion but on whole enjoy the show.
4,Chuck Season 4,The merchandise was as promised and delivered by the promised date. The only problem I have with it has nothing to do with the seller. The DVD's won't play in my computer. My PC will be ten years old this year and for whatever reason the discs aren't recognized by the computer. The first three seasons play just fine. It just limits when I have the opportunity to watch the series.Chuck: The Complete Fourth Season
5,Great Deal!!!!!!!,Item exactly as described. Easy transaction. No problems. Quick shipment. Amazon is a great place to order from. Never any problems.
4,Excellent Resource on Family Violence,This text provides detailed and sobering statistics on the prevalence of family violence in the home. This book is especially useful for social workers and counselors who provide direct services to families in crisis. I highly recommend this text for students and professionals who desire to understand the dynamics of family violence. You will be greatly informed.
2,Ack!,"While it is apparent that the authors are knowledgable about the subject of media and the effects on population, it is also readily apparent that they do not posess an English degree. Put bluntly, the text is difficult to read and sentences lack fluidity and eloquence. In addition, the studies mentioned are often repetitive and do not offer anyhting new to the subject being presented. It's informational but arduous reading."
1,Horrible,"These are some of the most disgusting tasting protien bars I've ever had. I was not even able to finish the first bite. They are bitter and leave a horrible taste in you mouth. No one in my family would eat them, except for the dogs. Maybe they taste like dog biscuits. I won't be buying them again."
5,Greaaat!,My husband wanted and needed this and really liked the price. All the blades are sharp now. Amazon got it here when promised.
5,Great file,I make jewelry from wire and needed a good file to round uneven edges. This does the job. I will probably get another for my spare tools box.
3,Too slow removal,"This is an intermediate or finish file, I must have been expecting a rasp or more aggressive file because this doesn't work too fast but, is good equipment for after a file I was expecting."
5,the rock and roll show,"My wife and I saw Danial, in Branson, along with my sister we enjoyed his music very much, I bought the cd for her as a Christmas present. I believe that all of his music is outstanding."
3,Disapointed,There are not 62 songs on this DVD. There is only 43!! The SODA FOUNTAIN part of the show was not included!!!! Make a DVD with the entire show(including the SODA FOUNTAIN part of the show.) I would then give the DVD a rating of 10!!!!!!!!
2,Do you like nice little stories?,"The book does not deliver on what it promises. The structure is ok, and the goal of presenting different problems with solutions from different industries is good. But then, the book dives into telling little stories about unnamed CEOs, and how they reacted to their respective e-challenges. This setting tries to make the challenges more personal, and it even includes ""The CEO's daughter's birthday"".Either you like this style, and then you will like the book, or it will set your teeth on edge."
2,another okay but uuuggg,I read this for a class project along with the 2nd book. This one was better than the sequel.
2,Nike Lance 4,"I have owned not one, but TWO of these watches.Pros:1. Absolutely beautiful styling2. The band holder - the band holder is a wonderful innovation from Nike. Never again will a band move because it pops out of the band holder.3. Being able to reset back to the time mode by holding the mode button down no matter where you are in the sequence of functions - another nice innovation by Nike.4. The band - this is a very comfortable, soft rubber band that wears easily on the wrist all day long.Cons:1. Stopwatch takes a relatively long button press to reset2. This watch is poorly made and simply isn't durable3. Case is easily scratchedOverall I really love the styling and functions of this watch. HOWEVER, the buttons on my first Nike Lance 4 became screwed up after about four months of wear. The second Nike Lance 4 started to reset itself after about three months of wear.Two chances are all you get - I switched back to Casio for reliability!"
3,Good service except...,"I ordered the item on Tuesday night and when I could not find any tracking information on Wednesday and nobody replied to my e-mail I sent on Wednesday I finally called the vendor and found out they were closed on those days because of Jewish New Year.There was no mention of that on the web nor ""Out of Office Reply"". If I did not call who knows when would I get it.They changed my shipping to overnight since I had to give it to somebody on Saturday but I still had to pay $38 shipping instead of $12.95.The customer service people were nice and helpful just too bad they did not wave the shipping or let me know they are closed.I could have easily ordered form somebody else hopefully without a hassle."
1,I was stupid enough to by a second when the first failed.,"I agree with other reviews, that this is a difficult piece to master. The altitude dirfts from -150 to +250 feet per day. I live at 5005 feet in elivation and have to set the watch at least once a day to keep it accurate. The temperature function is always off. The compas seems to work well. All of this is nothing compared to the time when it became necessary to replace the battery (less than one year with both watches). I didn't have the necessary special tools to replace the battery. Replacing the battery was a major accomplishment. I could not get the first watch to work after replacing the battery. The second watch quit working when the factory battery failed and I finally threw it away, as I had done with the first one. If you want to buy a watch that will work for the life of the factory battery only, this is the one for you."
3,Despite the errors,"Yes, as you probably have read in other reviews, there are some errors in the writing of this book. It's a little simplistic and hurricanes don't happen in January, (and there are more...)but the story behind the mistakes is true and sweet.The writing is easy to read. I read it in one sitting. The story is a sweet love story, and not exactly the kind of love story you would normally think of when I say that. It's a story about falling in love with yourself, as well as with God...oh, and the guy you meet in Hawaii, where you vacation to spite your boss.Certainly Lori Copeland should have triple checked her facts, but...after looking back to make sure I had remembered right, I moved on. They didn't detract from the overall story.It was a fun read. One I would recommend to my friends, with the warning that not everything adds up, but what in real life does, either?"
2,VAPID.,"This book was PAINFUL to finish.... In the beginning, I had high hopes of it being a fun, light-hearted & easy read. Instead, it was so predictable and cheesy with such a thin plot and even less substantial characters that I had to FORCE myself to read it each day, simply so I could be done with it and move on to something better. Sadly, most ""Christian"" novels that I have read have ended up this way.Now, I don't want to leave you hopeless - If you want a Christian novel that will keep your attention, assume that you have the intelligence to handle a well-written plot & theology, and have you excited to turn each page, look up ""Thorn in my Heart"" by Liz Curtis Higgs. Please take my advice here."
5,seaweed,This is very bad tasting so i grind it in the food processor and make my own pills with vegetarian capsules. I take it twice a day. Very nutritious.
4,Good buy,"A great addition to any workshop or toolbox,this 24"" level is dead on,the price was exceptional,and the design is fully functional and stable.I would recommend this product."
5,The Roman Civil War,"This is an excellent short work on the Roman Civil War for the general reader. It is written in such an easily read style that, at times, it reads like a novel. It's quite linear, and so all of the many convolutions of this distant and confusing conflict appear to be made clear. Where there are contadictions in the historical record the author notes them, and then gives his best idea of what he feels is correct. I found the work very interesting, and learned quite a bit about this period ofRoman history that I had never known before reading this work. That is a high compliment to the author."
5,Best babydoll for all ages,I love this little doll. My sister and I both had one growing up so my daughter had to have one too. I still have mine and it has held up for 35 years. It has a soft body with a slightly harder head. It is perfect for infants on up. These are the cutest and most well made dolls you can buy.
5,Madame Alexander Baby Huggums with Pink Check Onesie 29200,My favorite gift for newborn baby girls ... their first doll! I buy it for all my favorite family and friends.
5,carter wong is one of the best,i can honestly say i have never seen a bad movie with carter wong .like every thing else that he does this movie will become a collector's favorite.great fight scenes and excellent drama
5,Wu Tang Swordsman,Another great classic movie for the collection as i call it a keeper. Nothing like the Wu Tang Clan to keep you on your toes.
2,Did I watch the same movie?,"In the movie I saw, the camera work was absolutely horrible, the acting was comically bad, and the Kung-fu was sloppy. I could'nt even force myself to get half way through the film (mainly due to the bad camera work, the focusing was abismal!)Go ahead, take your chances, but don't say you were'nt warned!"
2,2 1/2- maybe 3 stars?,"Carter Wong is good in this film showing off his swordplay, but overall it lacked a real strong flowing story, and also lacked a great climactic fight. There were fights all the way through that seemed slow and choppy, and the Main villian didn't seem all that powerful. You'll think the movie is ok, untill the final fight when you wait for about 10 minutes hoping it will pick up, and then when you think it is, it's over. For those die hard collectors and fans it's a good film, but if your lookin for off the wall action, pass this one up till later."
2,"Choppy, and confusing.","Carter Wong stars in another, could have been classic Martial arts film. A story that was slow, confusing, and action that was very choppy, and telegraphed. But worst of all, the main chericter didn't even beat the bad guy. What's up with that? Unless you have money to waist, or a friend who did, don't bother."
4,"So meticulously presented, it exhausting to read!!","This book should be required reading for every American. Mrs. Jacobs shows how the foolhardy ambitions and inept design of America's cities by every politician, architect, and urban planner had come to preclude our cities from being successful places where we want to live. What makes this book remarkable, however, is that Mrs. Jacobs offers pragmatic suggestions on how to resurrect our neighborhoods. The book's offerings fly in the face of what many scholarly urban planners accept as doctrine, but Mrs. Jacob's ideas work where the rest of us live - in real life. The book's only drawback is that it's a bit dated, and it's a bit too long. Mrs. Jacobs could have made her case in half the time. Still, this should not distract from her work. All we need are people brave enough to perform the radical surgery this book suggests."
5,A suggested movie to set the tone for the book,"I highly reccommend that anyone who reads this book download the movie ""the dynamic city"" (its free and legal) from the Prelinger Archives at archive.org - this video will show the reader the ideology in the urban planning world at the time this book was written and what Jane Jacobs showed us to be ineffective. A high speed connection would be best for the download.This is the best book I have read."
5,"Great Book, Seminal Work","The Death and Life of Great American Cities should be read by anyone interested in cities, urban development, planning, architecture, and culture. It's as applicable today as when Jacobs wrote it, maybe even more so. Jacobs gave me language and described how I see the world around me. She's totally right on about liveable cities and cities who adhere to her principles are thriving economic areas and those that don't, have seen a huge decrease in value."
5,"Classic Urbanism but Lacks Analysis, Modern Update by Doug Rae","Jacobs classic urbanism text lends flowing descriptions of the living city. It lacks rigorous analysis, but this is easily subsidized by the recent tour de force by Yale professor Doug Rae - City: Urbanism and Its End."
5,An unforgettable classic,"This book has been a classic almost since the moment it was published in 1961. Death and Life of Great American Cities helped do for urban planning what Rachel Carson's book Silent Spring (published about the same time) did for the environmental movement. Jacobs was a journalist living in New York's West Village who was a keen observer of what it is that makes cities vital and vibrant. Her analyses of the importance of neighborhoods - especially dense, mixed use, complex neighborhoods - helped spawn an entirely new appreciation for what cities are and can be. As a young graduate student in architecture in the early 70's this book left a deep and lasting impression and had a profound impact on how I view my surroundings; it's a must read for anyone interested in the built environment."
4,A classic,"If you are interested in community building, urban planning, and city life in general, this is a must-read. Though the book is older, the themes and ideas stand the test of time."
5,A debate on every page,"An opinionated exploration of great cities. I might have disagreed with the author almost as often as I agreed with her, but her opinions are lucid and compelling. Highly recommended and a pleasure to read."
5,Brilliant Book,"Though this book is not perfect, and not everything Jane Jacobs says is right, and it sometimes feels a little dated, it is a brilliant book and she is one of the greatest thinkers about cities ever. Required reading for anyone who lives in or is interested in cities."
4,Thomas Jefferson by Bernstein,"Thomas Jefferson by Bernstein has been a very good read. I heard Bernstein's book was the best as far as describing the life of Jefferson and his accomplishments. I am half way through the book and it has not disappointed me, rather it has peaked my interest to read more about Thomas Jefferson. Purchased the book used on line from you and it was a great value.Thank you"
5,A great overview of TJ,"A short very concise biographical look at the important factors and contributions of Thomas Jefferson. Having read many others of much greater detail, this book should be the starting point for anyone wishing to learn/study the life of this unusual and great early American."
2,Another Tired Repeat,"Whatever inspired the author to write this when there are already so many books out there about Thomas Jefferson? And, this is merely another book of opinion rather than something new resulting from bonafide historical research. These Jefferson books that are slanted negatively with no real new information are getting to be a bore. Although I'm a Jefferson buff, I'm tired of them. No need for you to make the same mistake I made. Nothing new here. This is just another tired repeat."
3,Bernstein's Jefferson,Not as rich in interesting detail as any of D. McCullough's books that touch the same historical period; too brief.
3,Enjoyed but slightly disappointed,"Overall, I did enjoy Bernstein's ""Thomas Jefferson."" After just reading two 600+ biographies on Washington and Adams, I wanted to get a smaller book that would just cover the basics of Jefferson's life. This book did just that and I was pleased with that aspect. But, I did notice a few small errors in the book. For instance, he gets the death date of George Washington wrong. Even if it's only by a day, it still seems like a small fact that could have easily been found. It made me wonder what else about the book was wrong. If you really want to study the life of Jefferson, I recommend reading a longer biography. The facts can sometimes become tedious, but there are so many amazing details that you miss in a short biography. I didn't feel as though I truly got to know Jefferson in this book. For all its purposes, though, it was a great read."
3,There must be better Jefferson biography out there,"Bought this book based on the reviews here. Enjoyed the book. But as some other reviewers said, it's not a page turner. The writing... is just ok. Having read the Founding Brothers (highly recommend it), this book somehow doesn't provide the richness in writing or in content."
1,Useless and bad writing,"Unless you know nothing about Jefferson and the period of American history in which he figured, don't think about buying this book. Don't even think of borrowing from local library.This is a rehash that could pass as a high school review book. And the writing? Well, bad writing, I think, always reveals the shallowness of perception. Example: Bernstein's Introduction begins with the epitaph on Jefferson's cemetary stone; Bernstein follows through with a few observations and then writes: ""In life, Jefferson never found the quiet that surrounds him in death."" And who does? The rest of the book is even worse.I wonder how books like this get past the first gate. It should never have been published. It's certainly not worth a glance."
1,Meager product,"Why did Mr. Bernstein come up with such a meager product?--as though someone with an ""in"" suggested, ""Hey, there's a commercial niche for a small book on Jefferson. Give it a go."" I wish he hadn't. He gave little substance either to Jefferson or his book and made factual and interpretative missteps in the bargain. Save your money."
2,I've read better,"This book is hard to follow, and written as a suspense book. I really thought this was going to be more of a history type book. I got it to read after I read Jefferson by David McCullough. David is a much better writer."
4,Wah-hah-hah...they sound like Spoon! how dare they...,"...gimme a break, just don't Gimme Fiction when ROHS' debut record is a lot more exciting that Spoon's latest. I'm sick of hearing about Robbers on high street ripping off Spoon (apparently the indie rock equivalent of blowing up a school bus)."
5,Refreshing!,"This is a truly great record, end of story. Spoon wishes they were this good when they were 23. Heard them on NPR and was immediately sold."
2,They are sooo like SPOON,"The lead singer might as well be doing a Britt Daniel impersonation. Poor man's version of SPOON. Also, the people who keep incorrectly saying ""the Spoons"", seriously, who are you kidding with ROHS is better? Granted some of their stuff has moments of brilliance and is defintely better than most mainstream garbage it just doesn't do anything for me."
3,This year Spoon's coming out with 2 albums!,"I heard ""Japanese girls"" on the radio and was psyched that modern rock radio would play new spoon. Then I found out, to my bewilderment, that it was not actually spoon.I don't really get the point of completely copping someone's style, unless (a) they've been gone for 20 years (joy division -> interpol) or (b) you're just trying to make money and don't care about music (jet, presumably). These guys sound pretty good, but it's kind of bizarre that they would crib so shamelessly from a band that is still around, making good music.You'd think if they really had confidence in themselves as a band, they'd strike out with their own style. So that's confusing. But anyways, it's not too bad."
4,Simple Tunes and Forward Motion,"The obvious antecedent for the NYC foursome Robbers on High Street is Austin's Spoon. This is, in essence, because Ben Trokan's vocal ID on Robbers' debut full length Tree City is remarkably similar to Britt Daniel, even down to the slurred drawl. Their simple songs are also reliant on rhythmic piano fills and the type of solid drumming that harkens back to the days of the Kinks. And for all the cries of retro, the simple tunes and forward motion win out. From ""Japanese Girls"" naked ambition (""I'd know what I want if I knew I could get it"") through ""Bring on the Terror"" through ""Hudson Tubes"", the tinkling piano keeps the rhythm rolling and Trokan nails his small observations one scenario at a time."
4,Beautiful christmas tunes!,"This is the best christmas cd to have on, it will make the mood of christmas time. A wonderfull collection of old music box christmas tunes."
5,Great fun for the Hamtaro fan!,"My daughter (8 years old) loves Hamtaro, so we got her this book for Christmas. She and her 6 year old brother were able to punch out and assemble most of the pieces themselves. And they have really enjoyed playing with the little clubhouse and hamster figures. I'd recommend this book to Hamtaro fans who like to play make-believe, and who like to work on paper projects."
1,split second,"I am very disappointed with this book and probably will not even complete it. It's a coming-of-age book that is not to be believed. The protagonist is a 17 year old girl who does crazy things with no apparent forethought. Granted, she is out of my age group, but I find her hard to believe. If you're an adult, don't bother with this one."
5,Great product...,There is nothing worse than working in tight spots and having to light. This is the perfect solution. Great buy and excellent lighting.
3,nice but material is too thin for me,"I like this top, its cute and a good length. But the material is very thin and stretches way out and I found it did get pretty baggy. Im 5'9"" and normal size and bought a medium initially but it was really loose on me so i exchanged it for a small. Even that still feels a bit baggy too. Personal preference of course but I like a heavier material that feels like its hugging you a bit more."
3,Does it's job,Quite small but useful. Needed something to help me hang posters on my wall. All my visitors used to joke about how crooked they were hung.
2,Disorganized,Text and illustrations in a seemly random arrangement make this book okay for the coffee table but a sorry excuse for reference material.
1,Scattered,"This book either needed to be a solid scifi romance or a piece of erotica with futuristic overtones. What the reader is stuck with is an inane compilation of action scenes and half-realized sex scenes without much of a solid story beneath. Lucy, who in the end comes off as a sort of spineless character, is dragged through one bit of trouble after another. None of the cast lives up to a partial potential. The overall moral message of the book is lost in layers of vapidness.Having liked all of Ms. Davenport's books I've read up to this one, I'm sad that this one didn't join in with that club. I'm glad I know she's done much better work. If I'd started with this volume, I'd have missed out on amazing books like Godheads."
5,Very intriguing,This was my first Emily Devenport novel and I fell in love with her style. She creates gritty three-dimensional heroines that are a gas to read about. Her story lines are unique and fast paced. I recommend all of Emily Devenports books.
2,Does not fit my car as advertised,"The wires are so long in this set, my engine could be about 2 more feet behind the distributor and they would still reach. I had to coil them up around the strut adjustment bolt to get them out of the way. The boots are so large, they barely fit on the cap, and there is no play to position them to route the wires in a clean and neat fashion."
5,Essential for future competitiveness,"Selling To The Old Brain is essential to the future of how you will do business. A must read if your vision is to expand, and profoundly change the bottom line with your exsisting and future customer base.Futuristic in scope, and impactful in practice, Selling To The Old Brain redefines what success must include."
2,Sizes seem to run large.,"Good quality sweatshirt, but I agree with the reviewers who commented that the sizes seem to run large. This was true for my order and it was returned."
1,What you got is not the same as it posted,I just got two clothes one week ago. I am extremely disappointed. One cloth has very sharp cuts on the front and the logo color is different from the image on the website. The other cloth has the same problem of logo color which makes the cloth looks very ugly. I have to return the two clothes which cost me 9 dollars. Be very aware!
3,Sizing is Inconsistent,"I've always been a huge fan of Champion sweatshirts so I continue to buy them, each time taking a gamble as to whether the intended recipient (me or my spouse) will be the actual recipient. I say this because I bought him a large last year and it's more like a medium that would fit me better. So the other day, I ordered a medium for me and guess what? It's like a circus tent. I dried the he** out of it and now it appears to be better-sized for my spouse. I wish they'd get the sizing consistent but I assume that's probably a product of being made in multiple overseas locations where the guidelines vary..."
5,sweatshirt,"this is beautiful quality material. nicely made, nice color also. Champion always has good stuff!"
1,walnut,the reason i bought this because i thought this product is better than other juicer but no i was wrong. after only a day of use the motor simply died.
2,rip off on replacement parts,It has small rubber stopper to stop the juice from dripping. It doesn't fit well and keeps coming off from juice spout. It is unavailable as replacement part so you have to buy coplete juice spout for $13 in order to replace stopper.Poor back up!!
1,Very disappointed,"I have an old juicerman jr juicer, and the plunger warped in the dishwasher. I thought the powerjuicer would be easier for cleanup, plus the ads said you get more juice from it. WRONG. I was very disappointed from the get-go. The pulp is very wet, so clean up is difficult, plus, there is too much waste. I have to spend more time preparing the items for juicing. All in all, I much prefer the old little juicerman jr for juicing, even with the warped plunger. I feel I got ""taken"" by falling for the TV commercial for Jack LaLannes power juicer. If you are buying your first juicer, don't fall for the commercial like I did. Save yourself some money and go for the juicerman jr. Great little juicer ( I have had mine for over 10 years, and it is still good even with the warped plunger!) Big fan of juicing. No fan of the power juicer."
1,"motor bad, repair center worst",Received this unit and within two weeks the motor stops working.I sent the entire unit back for warranty repair in late 2005. It's been four month and I am still have nothing but problems getting it back. There is diffenitally a better juicer out there than this. Their customer service will pretty much take back any health benefits you may have from Juice you make with this machine. That's if you can keep this juicer working.
1,Motor Problems,Three months after I purchased mine the motor will not run and a small crack has developed in the top of the motor housing. The unit was not and has not been dropped. The three month warranty was up less than a week ago. I will return it to see if they will still honor the warranty but I will have to pay shipping and include $19.95 for return postage. It's going to be costly just to see if they will fix it.Overall the unit works well but it's a nuisance to clean. Veggies start to smell quickly so you will probably need to clean it as soon as you use it... I do!I will try and remember to come back and post a reply after I get a response from the factory.
1,good concept but breaks down,"after only a week of use the motor simply died. put in a call to tristar who admited they were having problems with the motor. they offered to replace the unit but after reading some of the reviews in amazon, i decided to return the entire unit for a refund. don't want to deal with delays and refurbished motors that may break down again. will go back to mr juiceman instead."
2,Love the juicer but the machine broke after 3 months.,"I love the juice that comes out of this machine but the warranty is very poor. I received mine as a christmas gift and this morning Feb 23rd it broke. (Making grapfruit juice.) Of course, you don't look at the warranty until something breaks. Here is the deal.First the machine only has a 90 day warranty. To use the warranty you have to ship the juicer to them with a check for $19.99 for the return shipping. There is telephone number you can call to check on the status or any estimated turn around time.From my perspective, my having to pay the round trip shipping because of their poor product quality does not seem fair."
2,Degradation and Burnout,"My wife and I received one of these units from her parents as a housewarming gift. My first impression was that it seemed very sturdy, very trust worthy. For the first two months or so, we juiced every day with great satisfaction. One day, however, we tried making a very large batch, and got a good deal of pulp in our juice. We stopped and cleaned the juicer, but every day after continued to get a small amount of pulp in the juice. The juicer would tend to off balance and vibrate as well. We changed blades, but to no effect.Last week, my wife tried turning on the unit and got only a humming noise, no spinning blades. She took it apart, and there are no blockages. Possibly motor failure. It's past the sparce 90 day warranty. It looks like our next juicer will be the Breville."
2,"Maybe it's just that I'm not a ""true juicer""","I received this item as a gift. I'm not one of those who are totally into juicing as a way of life. Rather, I enjoy cooking and sometimes a juicer is used for a special recipe. In any case, I figured I'd give it a try to see how it worked and enjoy some fresh juice.Maybe I'm just not a ""true juicer,"" but to me, the amount of produce I had to buy, the amount of time to prep it, and the amount of time spent cleaning up afterwards is really quite a bit more than I'd like to spend for a measly 2 cups of juice.Thank goodness all the parts do come off and go into the dishwasher. However, pretty much every part was caked with pulp, so I had to rinse it thoroughly first. And, after washing, some of the parts were stained by the carrot juice.I did not find that this was convenient at all. It probably took me a total of 40-45 minutes to wash, prep and juice the produce, and then clean up afterwards. That's a lot more time than I want to spend for a glass of juice."
1,Spout problems,"I dont have a problem with the motor (as yet) but do have problems with spout, it appears that a small piece has gone missing leaving it unable to click up to stop it dripping, also the hole that it left just lets the juice run down the side I have asked for a replacement but it doesnt appear to be coming, so its back to the telephone, apart from this it is a good juicer."
5,I LOVE this juicer!,"I have been looking for a juicer for awhile now - but they ALL seem to have negative reviews. Well, I actually found the Jack LaLane power juicer for $20, New in the box at my local dollar store! So i had to buy it :DI think it makes great juice! There was just a tiny bit of pulp left over and it was very dry at that. One medium carrot and one medium apple gave me a cup of juice - it was delicious. Great juicer!"
1,What a piece of Crap!,"I juice a lot of carrots. At first it worked as well as my Krups juicer, but its big advantage was the large aperture, which allows me to juice three carrots at a time. A big time saver. The first thing that went wrong was that it just stops when it gets too hot. Some blog I found said to let it cool off and it will work again. This does work, but is a major pain.Recently, one of the screws that holds the plastic bottom casing tight has stripped so the plastic casing vibrates. It vibrates so much that the blade is somehow scraping the plastic from the case. The plastic scrapings end up in the juice, so it's just garbage.What a piece of crap! Sorry I bought it. REALLY SORRY!"
2,good juicer until its rotor broke!,Hi. I just noticed some people have the same problem as I do. This juicer is not as sturdy and high quality as you say. The plastic rotor on the motor cracks over time and then... the whole juicer is just done for. I can't imagine why they didn't make that part made by some kind of metal. Anyway you may want to mention this to your readers...
1,It died!,"I thought the juicer was great, until about a year after I bought it when it just stopped working. I tried contacting the company by email, but never received an answer. The phone number given on the Web site was busy all of the time. I had an Acme for almost 10 years before I decided to use the Power Juicer. That was a much better investment."
1,Good Product ... TERRRRRRRIBLE Customer Service!!!!!!,"My husband used this product for less than a month, It worked great during that time but toward the end the motor DIED! We calleD TriStar products and they said we would receive a replacement motor in 7-10 business days. It took a month to receive the motor and after we received the replacement motor, it wouldnt give power. It was defective. I called again for another replacement and am still waiting. All in all within the last 3 months we have only had use of this product for 20 days!WHAT A DISAPPOINTMENT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
4,good juicer but a pain to clean,"I love the fresh taste of the juice. It does a great job of that although this is my first juicer and I don't have anything to compare it to. However, its kind of a pain to get clean. I rinsed everything off and put it in my dishwasher. The fine screen didn't get very clean. I don't know what to do with that. The recipe book that came with it wasn't very informative about what the recipe will do. You have to guess according to the title of the recipe. I did like it when I forgot to remove the label from an apple that the label was in one piece in the pulp receptacle. It does a great job of juicing , the pulp that is left is very dry. It's initial purpose is completed well."
1,unhappy customer,"I owned the watch for about 30 days and the unit worked fine. Took watch off one day and put it in my pocket and the watch reset and then neither myself or Niketown store manager could get heart monitor sensor to link again. Received replacement and manager linked at store, took home and tried to enter heart rate limits and watch reset and again I could not link sensor. I believe there are better units out there for the money they are charging for this watch."
1,Not what I expected,"Just wanted to make known that this book didn't give me the information I was looking for and expected when I purchased it. While it is a fine memoir and description of the author's personal experience, what I was looking for was a more straightforward presentation of the basics of the the religion. While the book does contain this information woven through the narrative, I tired of wading through pages and pages of minute details of the author's personal life (including such minutia as the exact addresses of former residences) to reach the kernals of wisdom I was seeking. I finally gave up and went searching for another book. On the other hand, if what you are looking for is a story of one woman personal discovery of the Santeria religion, this is a good book to read."
3,Three Stars,"I like the fact that Vega is telling of her experience, from being a skeptic to becoming initiated into Santeria. this is a good book for those interested in the religion, but it's not in depth and left me yearning for more."
4,the Altar of My Soul- The Living Traditions of Santeria,"This book was excellent. Dr. Vega shows eloquence and breathes life and clarity into the religion of Santeria. Her historical, sociological and intellectual expression of Santeria and what is all about is amazing. She is a great author and 'mother"" of the religion. This book does lack actual ebbos(spells), but it is a great learning tool and helps take out some of the ignorance and hate that people (who arent aware) of the religion and what it stands for. I am proud to know that Santeria is being praised instead of ill-tongued. I recommend it to anyone."
5,The Altar of my soul,The Altar of my soul was a wonderful teaching and learning tool. This book is exceptionally good for the novice that wants to learn more about the Santeria perpective of the culture. Great place to start and even for the knowledgable in this culture its a great refresher. This needs to be a must have in your literary library.
5,Great,The Powerpuffs rule and this CD is the greatest. Only uptight sexually repressed psychotics could fail to love this album. The tracks -- they're all wonderful so why bother to sort them out? Get with it!
5,Powerpuffs are Too Cool!,"I ABSOLUTELY LOVE this cd!!!! The music on this I was expecting and the music is easily the coolest I've heard! If you haven't got this cd or at least have checked it out, i deeply encourage you to! You will NOT be disapointed!!!"
4,Superb Soundtrack,"The three young superheroines star in this amazing audio adventure where they save the day and play a little music, too. There are songs like ""Go Monkey Go"" by Devo, ""The Fight"" by Cornelius, ""Walk and Chew Gum"" by Optanganally Yours, ""I'm a Super Girl"" by Shonen Knife(they kinda sound like Puffy Ami Yumi), and of course, ""The Signal in the Sky"" by The Apples in Stereo. Note that some of those aformentioned songs became really neat music videos on Cartoon Network. Each song surprisingly goes along with the storyline, which is even neater. Also stay tuned on the final track, because of a hidden song will eventually play based on the ""Mime for a Change"" episode(as seen on ""Cartoon Network Christmas Volume 2: Christmas Rocks"" DVD).They say that the Powerpuff Girls Rock and this soundtrack happens to prove it !"
1,POS Mower,This thing broke the first day I had it. It's made of plastic and white metal. A piece of the white metal broke and I sent it right back. If this was made in the US of A it would probably be a good mower. Buyer beware.
1,"Way Too Flimsy at 2-1/2"" Setting",I have owned this MM-1 for about three years and use it very occasionally. I use it at it's highest setting. The cast parts that hold the thing together have now cracked in three places. At the high setting there is much more stress on these parts as business end is the cantilevered out. Don't buy one unless you are mowing a putting green.
1,"Broke within a Year, Sunlawn Support Invisible","I was a big fan of the MM-1 when it first arrived. More than happy to do my part for the environment, I didn't mind that it required a little extra attention to not let the grass get too long.However, after less than a year, of which only about 4 months were during cutting season, a bracket snapped that prevents the reel from turning freely. Sunlawn did not respond to a voice-mail. They sent an e-mail in response to mine, saying they would replace the affected part. That was 3 weeks ago, and additional e-mails have gone unanswered. Buyer Beware!"
1,Poor communication--broke after 2 uses,"Bad review for Sunlawn, but great review for Amazon. This is the first bad experience I have ever had with an Amazon Merchant. My reel mower didn't arrive by the date it was supposed to. After waiting several extra days,I contacted Amazon, who said wait until this new date, and it showed up. All was fine until the mower broke the 2nd time we used it. We had a horrible time getting a hold of sunlawn for a refund or replacement-- always getting a message about an unprecedented number of calls and never receiving an email response. When I left a message with sunlawn saying I was contacting Amazon about their service, I finally got a call back. They said I would receive a return shipping label-- but it never came, and I never heard from them again. I did hear from Amazon, who followed through and refunded my purchase. Amazon is wonderful -- just stay away from Sunlawn."
5,wonderful,"great, easy to use ... would recommend for everyone.. looked good and everyone wanted to know where i got them"
5,Great Tabs,"I have just received my tabs through the mail, I must say that I was surprised to see how pretty they are. Not to mention they are helpful with bible page turning. Now my whole family wants some for their bibles as well."
2,Flimsy,Center lead fell out after we unscrewed it to move it once. These need to be slip fit or given some standard for applications. Having to Gerry-rig a $200 cell phone amplifier to get the same manufacturers antenna to work on it with a 20 cent part makes it all worth nothing!
2,Call wilson,"wilson will send this out to you for free if you did order a sleek, i did notice mine never came with the adaptor"
1,We all make mistrakes. I intended to enhance my /,This product was not the right product for my intended use this connector to enhance my Cell phone amplifier by connecting it to a directional outside antenna. The lines were different and I never got to use this connector so good luck to all of you home boys that maake mistakes and order the wrong thing.
1,Worst Guide to Spain and Portugal... Ever,"I spent two months in Spain and Portugal this Summer with Let's Go as my only source of information and it constantly let me down. Times, prices, phone numbers were often so wrong that I eventually gave up trying to plan anything in advance and ended up relying on my broken Spanish to keep me alive and on schedule. The maps only show the most expensive and most touristy parts of town and the restaurant and club reccomendations seem to have been paid for by the establishments and not based on merit. I stayed with friends in Granada and Lisbon who wouldn't be caught dead at the clubs Let's Go gave the thumbs up (their highest reccomendation). If you want to meet other tourists with the Let's Go guide, then buy it. If you want an authentic enjoyable experience, buy a different guide"
1,Don't go with Let's Go!,Just got back from a trip to Spain and Morocco. This book was useless! I bought it because it contained info on both countries. Lonely Planet doesn't offer an equivalant. The only info that was useful I also found on the internet before I left. The maps are horrible. It barely covers the small towns in the south of Spain.
3,Hangul stickers,"Pretty easy to apply, we'll have to see how durable they are. I got two of them in the event that there are problems."
5,Great,"I ordered another set of keyboard stickers along with this from another seller and I'm so glad I got this because the other seller sent a wrong order.The stickers stick onto the keyboard very well but you have to be quick because if an edge of the sticker got onto the key crooked, then your sticker can't be adjusted correctly since it's very sticky.Words stand out clearly against my white keys though some consonants are a bit too large for my key and there might not be space between my English alphabets and the Korean hangul characters. Otherwise, it's really good and looks like it will last a long time :)"
3,Korean keyboard stickers,"For someone who needs to know the Korean characters on their keyboard, this is a great way to do it. My wife is Korean, but I am not. We both have our own computers. Hers has the Korean alphabet on it, but mine doesn't. Any time she need to use my computer to write in Korean, if hers is not accessible at the time, it is difficult to do this. By attaching these stickers, both of our systems are interchangeable, and there is no longer a problem. I hope this will enable me to become more familiar with the Korean Alphabet as well.After using them for a while I am only just slightly less enthusiastic. They do have to be individually trimmed to fit on the keyboard, and when you attach them, your keyboard has to be immaculately free of dirt and people grease. If it isn't, the characters will slide right off. It's an OK temporary solution, but not something to depend on for any length of time. Still OK though."
3,Simple to use.,It was easy to install and easy to setup. Adds additional ports and allows my laptop sound system to always be plugged in. I bought the first at a price far too high ($90) as it was just before Christmas. After Christmas I bought another for 25% of this price. I would recommend.
5,Me and My Drum,"I was truly impressed with this young author's first work. Mr. Mignanelli has certainly mastered the eloquent use of the English language in this intriguing novel. The twists and turns of the plot, like one's own life, make this book hard to put down! Sections of the book made me laugh; others made me cry. It is a deep, compelling literary work where one clings to each written word. I certainly look forward to future books by this brillant author."
5,Monroe Hood Lift Support,"Great product, I have no complains. Was delivered fast. Easy to install, even for beginners. Can't find a cheaper price than amazon's."
2,Don't bother,"I bought this for my six year old. I was extremely disappointed with the durability. Every time he drops it the head and all the equipment fall off. It is very difficult to put back together! It's a struggle to get all the pieces in place in order to get the helmet back on. For the price of this thing, (45$) this should not be! Everyone mentions difficulty with the boots, I can deal with tight boots, it's the head that makes this toy not worth the money."
1,Chickens**t,"It's fertilizer. I only bought it because for a dollar fifty, it was worth finding out whether he had included songs that belong to me. But he apparently recorded this before the ugly episode with the studio work."
5,Jacob's Shadow: Christian Perspectives on Masculinity,"There is no other book like Jacob's Shadow which addresses the unique issues of a masculine practice of faith. Among so much ""trendy"" books on the subject of spirituality, Anderson shares himself as man, son, husband, father, and pastor in a way that is disarming, authentic and penetrating. Built around the Biblical narrative of Jacob, son of Isaac and brother of Esau, the book sensitively help us all lower our defenses and enter more fully what it means to be a male created in the image of God. This book is without peer!"
2,Not worth the money,"I personally rarely spend much money on jewelry. I thought this item looked like a fun finger toy to have, so I bought it. I don't regret buying it, but I wouldn't buy again. It is fun to spin, but doesn't spin very well. Soap gets caught into it, and it is such a hassle to clean! Buy this if you have a lot of money in your pockets and you want to waste it."
4,"It's just what I wanted, but...","The ring is exactly the kind that I have always wanted, but the quality leaves something to be desired. The moons are made of some kind of resin that warps very easily. They will definitely fall out over time. Still, with some silver tarnish and a cotton swab, it's easily remedied."
4,"Good, but not perfect","Perfect if you tend to play a lot of large games, or like to have multiple save files in RPGs. With eight times the storage of a standard memory card, you'll never run out of space.There are a couple downsides, however. It is noticeably slower at saving than a standard memory card (I'd estimate it takes half again as long). It's a bit of an annoyance with games that already take a long time to save, or in games where you save often.The other issue is that it doesn't fit inside the game boxes like a normal memory card will. This isn't an issue if it always stays in the PS2, but if you want to carry it around it becomes a bit more of a problem. This problem can be fixed fairly easily by modifying the box, but it does mean having to damage the game box."
4,It is a memory card not a game. (Or) Is it a GAME OF REVIEW?,"I got it 3 days ago and using it with GT4. It is working good and no complaints so far. I decided to go with even after poor feedback because my friend is using this for more than 3 months and he is happy.Free shipping means your item will be shipped late. I guess, it has nothing to do with shipping carrier shipping method. Amazon pushes shipping date further away. May be, free means you are a second class customer! Try it for yourself by selecting different shipping methods, shipping date changes!"
1,Stick with Sony and Nyko.,"The card works in my PS2, which is at least better than the others here. The problem is that because I've saved more than 10mb to the card, it no longer allows me to save. This means creating new files or updating old ones. I'm leaving the PS2 on until tomorrow just so I can save the progress I made tonight.I haven't gotten to the point of corrupt save files yet, as far as I know. Then again, I haven't tried to load EVERYTHING on the card yet, so there may be things that are corrupted. At this point, I wouldn't be surprised.Don't buy this card, it's a waste of your money. You're better off with a Sony or a Nyko. I have two Nyko cards and have never had a problem with either of them."
1,Beware Fatwalleters...this is JUNK,"For my FW friends: Well folks, you are prob thinking this is a good deal. It is NOT! I bought this from Toys R Us back in March 05 and it was incompatible with my PSTwo slimline. Tried it in another (mine is an SCPH-70012 version 12) & same result. Finally tried it in a ""fat"" Playstation 2, and it ran flawlessly. But that was only for a few days, as I returned it. Did not want to have something that did not work in the slim Playstations. So do yourself a favor....if u own a slim PSTwo then this will probably not work. Research before wasting -your- money. Good luck, SeriusBlack."
1,A Big Bowl of Wrong!,"It seems like a good deal - for ten bucks more than you pay for Sony's card you get eight times the memory. What's the catch? The dang thing doesn't work, that's the catch! It'll do a pretty good imitation of a memory card. It LOOKS a lot like a memory card. It fits into the slot pretty nicely, too, but there the resemblance ends. It will work with SOME games, but once you've used it to save games with which it's incompatible, such as Resident Evil 4 and others, you'll get corrupted save files (not that you'll know this until you try to load them later, as the games APPEAR to save successfully) and your system will freeze when you try to delete or otherwise manage your saved games. Stick with the Sony 8MB card -the third-party cards are often garbage, and Datel's MAX is the worst THIS old gamer's seen yet."
1,Unreliable Memory Card,"I had this Playstation 2 memory card for 4 months. Our family played and saved approximately 50 different PS2 games on this card, and it didn't run out of memory. All of a sudden we can not load our game saves from this card. We can not format nor reset this memory card. This card is now useless."
1,Junk. Plain and simple.,"This card works fine up until the 10 mb mark, then it corrupts any data you put on it. If you delete some space then it works again. This is basically a 10mb card posing as a 64mb card. Stay far away, I even emailed datel (twice) with my problem and I haven't gotten a response. This is memory card is completely worthless. I'm very shocked retailers sale this card as I'm guessing more than half of them are returned."
1,Sucks,Ok this card sucks ral hard it won't save new data and it won't allow data to be transferd from card to card please do not buy this card of you will be out some money...
1,This does not work on any PS2!! Don't buy!,"Bought this for my son for Xmas. What a piece of junk. It says that there are ""0 mb available"" on this memory card. We tried it in several different versions of PS2's (his friends), all did the same thing, or just did not recognize it at all. I'm glad I bought mine from Amazon - no hassle return. They should trash it!"
3,Seems to work OK,"Seems to work OK with the ps2 slim, but not as good with the multitap that I was using that I purchased from Amazon around the same time."
1,dangit,"this memory card wont work with kingdom hearts 2.i dont know why.it works with my others games(dragon quest 8,gran turismo ,x-men legends).it always says insuffient memory when im trying to save to kingdom hearts 2.dont buy this memory card ever!!!!"
1,Horrible Piece of @*%*,"How can retailers sell this product? It does not work with tons of games on the slim PS2s. They should be sued for not warning consumers that their product does not work with most games. Stick to the Sony 8MB cards. This is a waste of time and money, I assure you."
1,Sony Playstation 2 Max Memory Card 64MB,The card does not function! The PS2 keeps looking for a Sony 8MB card. Go figure.
4,Works fine on the PSTwo Slim,"I've been using one for over a month and it hasn't given me any problems on the PSTwo Slim model. There isn't really a ""snap"" when you place it in the slot like the Sony memory cards so some people might try and jam it in more like I did the first time. But it works fine if you push it all the way in until it stops."
2,Good while it lasted...,"Well, I got this memory card to go with my PS2 slim about 3 years ago. It gets 2 stars for having lasted so long. When I bought this I didn't know about all these negative reviews here, so when I tried to load my game save today and it said ""corrupted data"", it came as a bit of a shock. ""Corrupted data? But I was just playing this yesterday and it worked fine"", I thought to myself. Then, a second game save became corrupted. So then I went to Amazon to see if others had experienced this problem, and, lo and behold, they had. Personally, I consider myself lucky that mine lasted so long at all. Still, the knowledge that any game save that you are working on could suddenly corrupt at any time for no apparent reason is unsettling. I can't really recommend this item since there's no guarantee at all that your copy of the memory card would even last as long as mine did. In this case, it seems best to shell out the extra money to get the Sony memory card instead."
1,Max Memory Card can ruin your PS,"I bought a couple of these for my kids to save space and $ from having to buy multiple 8MGB cards. What a mistake! If seems the card and included CD adds software code that overwrites and modifies the software for the console can damage your machine. Eventually our machine would not work at all so we had to send it back to Sony. They informed us that the problem was indeed the way the Max Card Software changed the machine, which had caused it to lock up. They strongly recommended we no longer use it as this is rather common according to Sony.Avoid!!! Do not buy or use this as it can ruin your machine. It WILL modify the code which can cause the console to lock up and no longer function."
1,D:,"I bought one of these cards and it died and took all my data with it! This has happened to myself and many people I know, don't waste the money! These memory cards are by no means reliable or a good investment.It will most likely take an Action Replay or a codebreaker to get your data off of it if it dies like mine did. Even with that I couldn't get all the data back.."
1,NO NO NO NO NO NO NO!,Over the past 2 years i have bought a 32mb and 2 64 megabyte memory cards from the max memory company. Each one has either had all files corrupted or is not able to be saved to. Tonight i went to turn on my guitar hero 2 game and for the 3rd time the memory was corrupted and i have every song which took me about 2 months to get and it was all gone and you cannot get it back.
1,Do not buy this piece of junk,"This thing was a complete waste of money. I've had good luck with 3rd party memory cards on other consoles, but with both the PS and PS2, 3rd party memory seems to be garbage.So far with the Max Memory device, I've only gotten two PS2 games to successfully save. Every other game I've tried fails to save and tells me that the device is corrupted. Bottom line, do not waste your money on this unreliable piece of junk. They're more expensive, but you'll be better off sticking with Sony memory cards."
1,Piece of Junk,"Dont waste your money of this piece of garbage, I would not take another one of these or anything else made by Datel even if you paid me. If you want a card that may or may not be recognized by your game, corupts the saves it does acept, and just randomly decides to reformat then this is the memory card for you otherwise stick with the sony brand card."
3,"Good introduction, but that is all","I read Carter's book as a reference to my graduate thermo course. The good thing is, that it is so far the only book I have come across, that covers both classical and statistical thermodynamics equally. You will find that most books that claim to do both (Callen's, for example) are in fact classical thermo texts with some statistical stuff dangling on it.The downside, is that it is a little too trivial. Having almost no exposure in stat. mech., I still find the exercises a little too easy. Concepts and derivations are spotty at times, and ""leaps of faith"" are common. Perhaps Carter wanted to spare the student from all the formalism. As a result, I needed a second book (I used Atkins' text on physical chemistry) to supplement my understanding.I suppose this book aimed for a senior undergrad level. Despite the brevity, I would recommend this book as an introductory book on the ""new"" thermodynamics."
1,Not for those new to the subject,"We used this book in a undergrad thermo course, it was almost of no use. It covered a fair amount of material, though I have seen books that cover more (Look at the dimensions, it is small and only about 400 pages.) It moved quickly, skipping details, especially in the proofs. I feel it would be a good summary for grad students who have studied thermodynamics before, but there are many better books out there for students seeking a first course."
2,Be careful who you buy from,"I spent more money thinking I was getting the real US version of the Classical and Statistical Thermodynamics book by Carter.. Instead I ended up receiving the international/Indian subcontinent edition. It was not listed as that and was being sold under the black and yellow US version. If I would have known that's what I was being sent, I would have bought from someone who was selling it advertised as that and therefore would have gotten the book for cheaper. Although the version of the book I received is in fact the same content wise, the quality of the book is much worse than the US version. I would just advise caution when buying this book if you're really wanting the US version."
4,Useful and challenging book,This is a challenging book to use if you are studying thermodynamics. It is concise; the theory and notation used were well done. There were some formulation mistakes in the Maxwell relations table and other little formulation mistakes. The author uses well known classical and statistical formulae well and good derivations (I liked that). Some of the problem sets were inconsistent with areas covered in a few chapters and some were oversimplified. Overall a decent book to use if your taking statistical thermo.
2,Not rrigourus enough,"Honestly, I was dissappointed in this book. It was too basic and didnt really explain anything in a great amount of detail. The exersizes were way too easy. I am an undergraduate physics major, there is no reason I should be able to do every problem in a chapter in 2 or 3 hours. That is unheard of. I really did not learn any thing from this book. Maybe it is good for a review, but it really is not good for learning the topic for the first time. Find something more detailed and rigorous."
3,Hanover Street Review,"A well used plot, with an improbable ""Action"" finish. Certainly flawed, but worth watching for those of us who remember WW2"
2,a young Ford and Down,"A bad Harrison Ford movie. Those who like the simulated sex may rate it higher, it wasn't much better than fair (2 stars) though."
1,A Cliché Dipped in Cheese,This movie appeared to be a horrible romance novel made into a bad film. The pillow-talk between lovers seemed to be from the imagination of a fourteen year-old girl. The banter amongst the flight crew sounded like someone desperately trying to be funny.IF YOU ARE A GUY - Don't bother. The action and brief nudity isn't it worth it.IF YOU'RE A WOMAN - The only tears you'll shed will be from laughing at what the author thinks is believable romance.
2,Harrison Ford and Lesley-Anne Down fall in love during war.,"Yet another World War II picture of a war-torn young man and a young woman who meet by chance and quickly fall in love. It all happens so quick. But what makes this film different than the others is a 36 year old Harrison Ford (who looks like he's 23) and Lesley-Anne Down star in the film. Harrison Ford did this film before he made Raiders of The Lost Ark and the other ""Indiana Jones"" films. This film plays like a soap opera and tries really hard to stir up emotion for you. This story has an interesting twist. Also in the cast is Christopher Plummer, Richard Masur, Patsy Kensit and John Ratenberger. DVD is in wide-screen format. Also includes Director's Audio Commentary and bonus trailers."
4,What can you say about a movie,"I liked the movie, but it wasn't a great movie. Take my review as or for get it. Ok, Ok, Ok."
2,We have seen this one before...,"This is a very ""flat"" filmed thing with close to no story whatsoever - platitudes piled on top of another! Pitty, it had potential tough, with a better director... (It is most famous because Harrison wrecked his first marriage when he had a relationship with Lesley during the filming) Whoops, gossip! ;)"
3,"Ah, young Harrison Ford......","...but that's the only reason to see this movie, just as Harrison Ford claims his only reason for making it was ""because he'd never kissed a female human being on screen before."" The romance is a bit unconvincing because Down is married and, however much they love each other, it's adultery, and hard to sympathize with them. Dialogue is flat and laughable at times, ""Fred? I think I love you!"" and the ending is, of course, less than satisfying. Ford is left to fight his war alone and doesn't get the girl. Still, Harrison is always worth looking at...."
4,A beautiful World War II Romance,"This is Harrison Ford as we never see him in other movies. In spite of his role as a rogue pilot during world war II, he also portrays a sensitive man who falls in love with a beautiful English woman. It has adventure but also a beautiful love story with one of the most beautiful & tasteful love scenes I have ever seen on film. I love this movie.RoseMarie D"
3,A Great Rough Draft of a Movie,"There are so many things to like about this movie...but it just doesn't work. Great ideas are there, but they don't come off. Harrison Ford, after STAR WARS but before Indiana Jones, is a dashing American pilot in WWII Britian. Lesley Ann Down is beautiful as an unfulfilled wife and nurse in war-torn London. And Christopher Plummer makes ""the other man"" a likable, sympathetic character.I really wanted to love this movie. All the elements were there. I just wish they had done a few more drafts of the script (or something) to really make it work.Worth seeing if you're a fan of any of the cast."
4,great romance,"This comes close to 5 stars for me, but not there. but close. It is a wonderful romance film. Ford did a number of films right after Star Wars. This is the best. Force 10 From Navarone is ok, and the Frisco Kid is cute but... not to many people remember these films, including this one. all i can say is that what really saved Ford from the fate of the other stars in Star Wars was Indy."
3,Woman will like it more so than men,"I got this movie for my wife. She loves it, and watched it several times over, which she hardly ever does on other movies. It's basically a love story during WWII. Harrison Ford's character falls in love (love at first sight) with an English nurse, who is already married to some important English man, who heads English intelligence (think England's CIA). Ford is a bomber pilot for the U.S., and a very good one. It's a typical Harrison Ford role. He's funny, charming, tough, and good at his craft, and lucky as far as not getting killed. He's a lot like Han Solo in this movie. Anyway, it has a pretty good ending so I won't give it a way. If your a guy, it's a good movie to see with your girlfriend or wife, but not a movie to see with your buddies."
3,"A sweet little movie, set in WW II","A little-known movie, it follows two lovers in London, during the Blitz. Harrison Ford plays an American bomber pilot, and Lesley-Anne Down is a British nurse. Christopher Plummer is her husband. The movie is sweet and tender, and every Harrison Ford fan should see it. The plot twists are contrived, to say the least, or else I would give it 4 stars. END"
1,Unbelievably wrong,"This is one of the worst World War II movie I have seen, and I have seen a lot. Not only the love story is farfetched, but a lot of details are wrong! Two examples: Harrison Ford'hair is way too long for 1943 + How could one of the characters enters the Gestapo Headquarters in Lyon without even once identify himself ? Because of these loose threads, I couldn't begin to believe in the story."
3,Harrison is great but the story is preatty slick....,This film is not a bad film. Harrison Ford and his co star does a great job acting but the story is not so good as you would hope. The films beginns out well when harrison meets this girl who is married and he wants to be with her. The girl and harrison falls in love but later in the movie harrison meets the husband of the girl he just falled in love with. I don't want to tell you all but the ending is very good and very sad. The ending pushed this film up many levels
2,Disappointing,"I had seen this movie years ago, but had little recollection of it, so I was looking forward to seeing it again.Unfortunately, second time around it was a real disappointment, particularly the character played by Harrison Ford. He was woody and unbelievable. In particular, the aerial combat scenes, with their attempts at sardonic humour, did not work for me.The action scenes stretched credulity somewhat, but, as in ""The Great Escape"", that didn't bother me all that much. You expect a bit of that in films like this, and it's even a bit endearing.The film was rescued to some extent by Christopher Plummer's character, which was for me, the best thing about the film. Lesley-Anne Down also does a reasonable job, but it's not Harrison Ford's finest hour, unfortunately. The story is pleasant enough, but Ford's charactter lets it down."
5,"Oh, what a beautiful story!","This is another of Harrison Ford's movies that my husband and I watch at least once a week! Since we are from the ""greatest generation"" - to coin the phrase from Tom Brokaw's book - this brings back memories of the ""great war"" and things that happened so fast in those days.. A beautiful story about two beautiful people. P.S. It does have its funny parts, too."
4,A most excellent tease.,This book is a refreshing little dip for an author looking for some snap. About one in four are really good one way or the other. It's a neat little literary field trip and a great conversation starter. I am pleased to add it to my library.
5,Small short story masterpieces.,"Each selection is a jewel- proving that a few words can speak reams about love, hate, jealousy and humor. A must for any budding writer."
4,"Some Hits, Some Misses, And The Chance To Ponder The Difference","A short story (to paraphrase Stephen King) is like a kiss in the dark: short, sweet, and if it doesn't work out, you can move on without regret. This book lets you try many shorts, linger if you enjoy, otherwise move on. In the end, you have a better idea why one story works for you and another doesn't."
2,Boring.,"Almost all the stories end with a twist. After reading about fifty of these, it starts becoming boring and excessive."
3,"Some Hit, Some Miss!","This collection of the world's shortest stories (as with most collections and anthologies of shortest stories) is a ""hit or miss"" collection. Basically, this means that while some of the stories are clever, others are flat-out duds. Most of the story's cleverness relies on unsuspected plot twists and ironies in the ending, thus making for an amusing read but bringing little to the table in the world of quality literature. Some of the stories are simply too minimilistic to have any emmotional impact on the reader, and others are very cliche and border on poetry. Instead of buying this book or any collection of ""shortest"" fiction, I would suggest seeking out specific authors who are masters of the shorter story, such as Raymond Carver. While none of Carver's stories are as short as 55 words, just one of his good shorter stories (""Popular Mechanics,"" for example) will pack a more poignant punch than any of the stories in this collection -- combined."
3,"A few gems, but only a few","How hard is it to write a 55-word short story? Not hard enough. There are approximately 200 stories in this collection; most of them deal with the usual - love, death, death of love, love of death, and murder. The best ones had to be read and re-read, unfortunately there were only a handful of best ones. Most of these were forgettable."
2,"about Kennealy, not Morrison","This book is worth a try. Kennealy insists *her* view is the only truthful one and pours vitriol on anyone who suggests otherwise. Basically you learn a lot about Patricia, not much about Morrison--the book is about her. (Which the title makes clear.) I enjoyed it for about two-thirds, then got fed up with her (genius woman writer or not!) and couldn't struggle on. I guess I was waiting for her to come around and get some perspective, and when I realized she wouldn't I couldn't read any more. (You won't know what Jim Morrison was doing day to day, but you will know what outfit Patricia decided on for each and every occasion, and which drugs she decided to take.) In a word: oy."
5,Strange Days,"Getting several views from people who knew him, and some who knew him better than others really helped to illuminate Jim Morrison the man not the rock star. A real eye opener regarding the people who surrounded him and the ""hangers on"". Unfortunate that hollywood chose to perpetuate the myth instead of the truth."
2,How much more can Kennealy capitalize on her brief affair?,"Ugh...don't even bother with this book. Check out ""Break on Through"" or ""The Lizard King"" for definitive bios on Morrison."
1,poor fictional work,"This book is a mostly fictional and highly exaggerated account of the author's brief encounters with Jim Morrison. It has much more to do with her own fantasies and wishful thinking than with reality. As to the author's writing style, it is in my opinion very poor and full of cliches.There's also something repulsive in the fact that a woman who professes her undying love for a man is so willing to freely exploit her ""precious memories"" with him in order to get money or whatever. Especially when this man is not here anymore to address the claims she makes about their relationship. In the author's defense one can only say that sadly she's not the only one guilty of that.Bottomline, I do not recommend this book unless you:a) really, really like her other fictional work and need to read all her stuff, andb) have such little interest in Jim Morrison that you do not mind being fed a lot of fantasies and lies about him.For everybody else this book is a waste of time and money."
3,Different oppinions make for an interesting read,"Patricia has an interesting view of the Morrison mystique. She still feels that Jim is his husband through marriage even though the marriage cerimony was done through witchcraft and Jim felt the whole episode to be one big game that was fun to play when high. He has said many times that it was just for kicks and though Patricia is an interesting person in her own right, her views on Jim are slightly off-beat. This was however a good book to read for a true Doors fan such as myself and I would only recomend it to those who will not take it too seriously."
1,very disillusioned,"Pamela is disillusioned,the fact is their ""wicca wedding"" wasn't anything Jim took seriously.Pam courson was his cosmic mate.For all you lame people who say others are jealous of pamela because she was with Jim Morrison you are just as disillusioned maybe more then pamela herself.she didn't know Jim for very long,he wasn't with her that much and his heart belonged to pam courson although they both screwed around on one another alot.But if you are a disillusioned ""wicca"" or mental patient this book is for you."
1,Draining the Lizard... Queen,"I actually ended up feeling quite sorry for Patricia by the end of this book.What a sad life it must be being so bitter and deluded. She took a fling and clung onto it for almost 40 years. Apparently she has forgotten about all the interviews she gave admitting that Jim did not take her seriously and the correct date the fling started. Also, by looking at photos and footage of her before she met Jim, it is quite evident that she is not a natural redhead as she likes to claim. You should check out the wayback machine and pull up her now-defunct website before you buy this book, clear evidence of the nut trying to pop out the shell."
1,Bitter Much?,"I did not know what to expect when I read this book- having read many other books on Jim Morrison and the Doors, I thought it couldn't be that bad. Boy was I wrong! This book is nothing more than the ranting, whining, and petty jealousy of a woman who took her affair with Jim Morrison way too seriously! She trashes everyone- from Oliver Stone to Val Kilmer to ""Tiffany"" aka Janet Erwin, to doors fans themselves. But she reserves special vitrol and hatred for Pamela Courson, Jim's cosmic mate, lover of 6 years, and the only woman who deserves the surname Morrison! Get over yourself Patricia! Get on with your life, and let Jim and Pam rest in peace! I am a huge doors fan, and I am not a lowlife yahoo!"
1,"was this book intended as a joke, or what?","i don't think i've ever read a book as badly written as this one before--ever. you would think from the language and the attitude that this book was written by a girl in junior high. at times i actually wondered if it was intended as a satire on books about morrison or something, because it is seriously hard to fathom an adult woman writing something as immature and ludicrous as this. at one point she talks about how she physically jumped a friend who made a comment on morrison that she perceived as a come on(insecure??) and punched her, and this is literally how she described it, ""pow! that'll teach her, that (...)"" (...) is this supposed to be a joke, or what? the title itself is amusing, ""strange days:my life with and without jim morrison"". as though anyone cares about her life without morrison. i would actually recommend reading it, because it is inadvertently hilarious and will have anyone with half a brain rolling in the aisles. bizarre."
3,Hmm...,"Alright, I'll be honest: I can appreciate the inborn New York City attitude. I can appreciate a no-nonsense woman who doesn't take guff from her man, even if the man in question is Jim Morrison. And for what it's worth, this book is written very well; it certainly held me captive.But what I don't understand is the obvious undercurrent of sheer rage that I feel throughout the book. Granted, to lose someone you love so quickly and so young would make ANYONE angry, but what I fail to understand is WHY the whole world is a terrible place as a result.From where I'm sitting, in his short life, Jim Morrison taught people to love the world and love life. I only hope his grief-stricken widow, for her sake, learns to do the same. From the sounds of this book, though, it doesn't look like she will anytime soon."
4,HER life,"many reviewers are bagging out this book because kennealy talks too much about herself, rather than morrison. prospective buyers please note- it says ""..MY life with and WITHOUT jim.."". also, many doors fans think she lies since they have read different (often second-hand) info prior, and are sticking to it rather than welcoming a biographer with primary evidence. i wonder if they will recant when copyright laws expire and kennealy prints her cache of writings received from morrison.five stars for the genre, four for the overall read."
1,Patricia Kennealy is pshyco,This woman was just a fling and now she's trying to make a living off of a fantasy about Jim Morrison.
1,Patricia Kennealy-Morri$on...,"Kennealy can't seem to keep her stories straight. In ""Rock Wives,"" she told author Victoria Balfour that she'd clock Morrison if he showed up at her doorstep today. Now all of a sudden she's his ""Lizard Queen."" In ""Rock Wives,"" she said that Morrison probably didn't take their handfasting seriously. In ""Strange Days,"" it's transcendent experience followed by mind-blowing sex. Kennealy changed her story after the Doors movie came out and added the ""Morrison"" to her surname as well (something she probably wouldn't have done if Jim were alive). A tribute to her beloved, perhaps? More like greed.This woman's ""Lizard Queen"" act has always rung false, and no wonder. See ""Your Ballroom Days Are Over, Baby"" from Doors Collectors Magazine for a more accurate picture of Kennealy's real relationship with Jim Morrison."
2,C'mon Patricia,"This book gave a lot of information on how Patricia was absolutely infatuated with Jim Morrison. I have never read so much hatred against Pam in my life!!! I found it pretty sad that she blamed Pam for Jims death. I mean, did Pam force a grown man to do drugs? Patricia stated in her book, ""How wise you were, Pamela Susan, to have smacked out yourself in 1974, because if you were alive right now, I would be on my way to California to kill you. Be glad you are dead."" I mean c'mon. Absolutely un-called for. This woman needs mental help.I believe this book is written in a fantasy that she believed in.Her crazy fantasy."
1,"Bombastic, Baseless, Boring","after reading this book, i was left feeling disturbed and unsettled by the author's recollections and fierce protectiveness of jim morrison. perhaps if she had left out the stalker-like zeal in which she wrote her memoirs, i would have at least experienced her frame of reference and respected her as someone who was giving her side and account of the situation. instead,i came away feeling very uncomfortable and unsettled. her account is not informative but vitriolic; she comes across as vindictive instead of sincere. anyone who discounts her claims as jim's widow or that she was his ""true"" wife and partner is the target of ferocious attack. the end result is a book that should not be taken seriously simply due to the author's literary conduct. and for that, ms. kinnealy has no one to blame but herself.it's quite sad."
2,Narcisstic Memoir. Get over the Fling lady,"Patricia seems a smart lady. She writes intelligently, she is no ditzy bimbo but she sure knows how to delude herself, and for 30 odd years at that!Pamela Courson was no angel. She had flaws like we all do. BUt she loved Jim and he loved her.The fling with Patricia was perhaps exciting and to him, I am sure he had some feelings for Patricia but unlike Patricia (who is strong and determined) Pamela was the opposite. He clearly liked to take care of her if he didn't he would not have stuck by her all these years. As for calling her a slut and junkie, how fair is that? This envy is killing you Patricia. Let the dead rest and get on with your life!"
4,Finally a book that gives insight on Jim Morrison the person,"""Strange Days"" is the first book to give insight on Jim Morrsion the person, and not Jim Morrison the lizard king. Patricia Kennealy paints a beautiful picture of a love affair, that was cut way to short. Anyone interested in finding out about the Jim Morrison who was a shy, romantic gentleman this is the book to read."
3,"If you're looking for a good Doors book, this isn't it!","Although I feel this book is fairly well written and informitive, it really isn't what I had in mind when I ordered it. I was expecting more of an insight into Jim Morrison and, less of a look into Patricia Kennealy. It does shed some light on another side of Jim which many other books haven't touched upon but, for me there just wan't enough of that insight. Instead we are treated to a running list of what Patricia wore at any certain event and, what drugs were consumed. I don't know about you but, I have a hard time remembering what I wore last week never mind, 30 years ago when I was stoned! From that perspective, I just had a hard time believing some of the other things that the author claims to have happened and, I question weather her perception of said events might not be clouded. I'm not calling anyone a liar but, it just seems to me that after 30 years the mind can have a very selective memory."
2,What a Witch,"Having read the book, I am convinced only of on thing.Patricia had an affair with Jim. Weather it was the love affair of all times, no one will ever know. I think it is fiction based on fact. OK, so now Pam is responsible for Jims death, and Kennealy hates her for it so much she would kill her if she were still alive. She trashes that girl so bad it sickens me.Pam inherited all of Jims money, why would she have to prostitute herself? And, according to other reliable sources, she died from a heroin od, but was not a junkie, the autopsy proved that. She is hateful and jealous and it spews onto every page of this book. It speaks volumes of her character. Read 'Angels Dance and Angels Die."" A great book, based on FACT."
5,Perfect size for a woman,"I'm an older lady, and it was nice to find a hammer that would do what I needed it to do, but in a smaller size. It's the perfect size for small projects, and a lot easier to use since it's smaller. Estwing makes some of the best hammers, and I was happy to find it on Amazon, and at a good price. It's hard to find this hammer in this weight, and size. I'm very pleased with it."
1,Only works with Disney Princess Controllers,"This is a Game Key for two Disney themed games playable on Jakks TV Games Controllers.The product picture is too low resolution to be able to tell, but the product states on the front, ""ONLY for use with TV GAMES CONTROLLERS featuring Disney Princess."" The product doesn't state this anywhere in the description.This will not work with other TV Games Controllers that accept Game Keys. Do not buy this product unless you already have a DISNEY PRINCESS TV Game Controller."
2,Not A Gordon Liu Movie,"His name is on the top, and his face is there on the left and down again at the bottom, and he is in two scenes of the movie, but this is not a Gordon Liu movie. It is an Aaron Kwok movie.The action is rediculous, sped up, and not very coordinated. The humor is poor, and mostly unfunny. The two male roles are played by very similar looking actors. One of them is introduced as being semi-powerful, but later on he doesn't use any of his power. There are subtitles over a Chinese audio track, but you can't turn them off. There are also two song number in it (I hate musicals).This is one of very few DVDs that I wish that I hadn't bought. I own about 40 kung fu DVDs and this is in my bottom three. It is terrible, from the beginning to the end."
2,Where's Gordon?,"One of the reasons for me purchasing the film was Gordon Liu's name on the cover. It turns out he is in very little of the movie. The English subtitles are poorly translated and at times very difficult to read. The story line is even worse, hard to follow and has a ridiculous ""batman"" vampire character.Do yourself a favor and buy a better Kung Fu movie."
2,Gordon Liu Only a Cameo.,"Gordon Liu is in no more than 10 minutes of this film. He has just one very brief action scene and it's too quickly edited to follow. While he is always thoroughly entertaining, his talents are greatly wasted in this film. The rest of this movie is just OK, like most of director Wong Jing's movies it is one part exquisitely surreal fantasy, one part unfunny comedy. I could watch it, but not without some fast-forwarding. For director Wong Jing's best work, check out Lord of the Wutang aka Kung Fu Cult Master."
4,Very reminiscent of Zu,"This is one of the HOng Kong movies that breaks no new ground, does nothing original and has no overarching plot to contain the 4-5 stories contained therein. The Jesus joke at the end if funny, but if you want to get your friends as excited by Hong Kong movies as you are, this isn't the one to use.However it's an enjoyable mess of a movie. The fight scenes are adequate. The pacing works. The weird motifs from Chinese opera are firmly in place. You can even forgive it for being marketed as a Gordon Liu movie when he's in it for five minutes at most (although one should note that the big name actor bait-and-switch is time honored tradition in movie marketing)So buy it, watch it and give it to your friends. It's not great, but it's not bad either."
5,It was good how they battled with the bat guy.,It was the best moive. Aron was a great actor and the people were all cool.
2,Has a terrible odor,"This trivet is beautiful and looks great hanging on my wall, but the one complaint I have is that it has a terrible odor. When I opened the box, the scent was overwhelming. I think it's the paint, but it smells more like used motor oil or something you'd smell in an automotive shop. I washed it with soap and water several times, but the smell is not gone yet. I can't use it at the table, because the scent would be too unpleasant during mealtime. I've had it for about a week now, and the odor has not subsided at all yet. I have no idea what to do with this thing now!"
5,A timeless treasure,"Aloha!Herb Kane's status as a National Treasure was well-earned. His knowledge of Hawaiian history and culture is translated beautifully through this book. The story-telling and illustrations are dynamic, sublime and intriguing. In addition to the narrative is an informative appendix.Not enough praise can be lavished on his work, nor gratitude for sharing and sustaining the oral tradition for generations to come. His spirit continues to inspire us all to embark upon our own voyages of discovery...Mahalo nui loa, Mr. Kane, a hui hou..."
3,Not a perfect replacement,"I needed a new shingle hammer/hatchet to replace one with a stacked leather grip which magically disappeared a year ago. The one I ordered appeared to have five holes to set the exposure, whereas the one that arrived had only three. In effect, this was exactly what my old hammer had as well, but I could have used the five. I think my old one was an Estwing as well, I got it at a yard sale for $1.00 thirty years ago. They have the same balance and the drawknife keeps a good edge. It drives 5d stainless ringshanks with two hits, just like my old one, so I can't complain."
4,Second of the novel length adventures.,"Second of the Gygax AD&D novels, Artifact is a sequel to Saga of Old City and AD&D in general."
4,Opening stages of Garrison's prosecution of Shaw,"This is an overview of the Jim Garrison case written by local journalists familar with the principal figures. It's bound to displease those who try to turn Garrison into a hero. Its principal weakness is that it has never been updated to follow the trial till its conclusion. It also tones stuff down on the various people involved, perhaps because neither author nor publisher wanted libel charges filed against them."
4,Choose this one.,"Are you a teacher? After viewing a different video, Emily Dickinson: The Famous Authors Series, I recommend this dvd instead. Even though the video quality of this dvd is poor,the narration of Julie Harris is much more palatable than the dorky, slow voice on the Famous Author Series dvd. Harris takes the viewer to Emily's home and to other locations of importance in her life. Viewers will see where Dickinson wrote and will see artifacts often pictured in biographies of the author. I purchased both dvds, but I will only show this Harris dvd to my class of advanced high school English students."
3,"Many photos of all the Merkava versions, but little info","This book covers well the history of the Merkava. The introduction has a summary of many years of history of the IDF armoured forces which led to the development of this tank.The book includes lots of photos of the Merkava I, II and III, from several angles and close-ups.However, no colour photos are included. Information is rather sparse and tends to be a bit superlative. There is little information about the tank interior.A comparison table of the three models is provided, but physical dimensions, forward and reverse speed, vertical obstacle clearing, etc. are missing (they are only mentioned for the Merkava II). Also it would be good to see a comparison against western and eastern tanks (specially the T-72)."
5,huge jump start,"I bought this video together with a Canon 5D MarkII and three lenses: 70-200mm f2.8 is II usb; 16-35 f 2.8 and fisheye 8-15 f4.I had no idea of how to use the manual function and only took automatic pictures. For my surprise, Manny explained everything such a way that, even without any previous knowledge, I was able to go out there and take pictures on Manual mode.I am really interested in learning how to take photos and really extract everything I can out of them. This DVD is a MUST.I only felt one thing was missing: his phone number so I could thank him personally.I am going to buy the other set of DVD's he offers."
3,Over priced!,"These DVD's helped me learn a little about my camera functions and how to set up a good shot. For $75, however, I would expect quite a bit more information. I would price the DVD set in the range of $25-$35 based on what I feel this information was worth to me."
5,Carol Tatum Rocks!,I bought this for my daughter who loves the harp. I was pleasantly surprised to hear the Metallica track (one of my all-time favorite bands)! This is one of our family favorites that we listen to often.
1,This book is not worth it,"I purchased this book with a lot of expectation because I had read it once as a child. This edition of the book is not simply worth your time.First of all, the tale has been badly abridged. In fact, the editors cut the story in the middle leaving out about half of the tale. The black corsair does not have a happy ending, but neither does some of the books from A. Dumas. Anyway you should not cut a story like this.Second, the book is typeset in a small, serif (times roman-like) print that makes it difficult to read. In fact, some of the characters are not fully formed. The result looks cheap and will detract from your reading enjoyment.If you want to read the story, look for another edition. I am doing the same."
2,The worst pirates book,"I can't put less than two stars to a book because I know what is to write a book, and just writing it it deserves two stars, but this is the worst book of pirates I ever read, beginning with this:The book has 400 pages, and if you take all the pages that doesn't have to do anything with the main story you will have a book of 150 pages or less, the main story is boring and contradictory, and the end is the worst end I ever read, sincerely skip this one."
4,"A Rare, difficult read, but a rewarding one!","Anyone who saw the film 'La Haine' and wants to get under the skin of the real French suburbs without the glorified Hip-Hop aesthetics and sensational dramatization should read Maspero's excellent ride through the stark no mans land so often left off of tourist guides.Where the books succeeds is in the honest, informed observations of the writer and the subtle, down to earth photos of Anaik Frantz.It's not a pretty read, but then it's not supposed to be and amongst the ugly outlands lies the promise of a thousand untold stories that form the reality of life in the French capital."
2,Cheap piece of gear,"This thing does what it is supposed to do, but save your money and buy an all metal one (Husky) from H-D. Much more durable and not much more expensive."
3,Ad nauseam,"The author clearly knows his stuff, but is guilty of making a book out of the following contents- Favour using your native language with the child if you speak other languages weakly- One parent one language, avoid mixing two languages in the same context- It's mostly not true that bi- and multilingual children get ""confused""- If your children have problems, it's probably not bilingualism's fault- Use common sense- Aren't my analogies beautiful?- Use some more common senseNow copy and paste this 2000 times and there you have the book."
5,The Greatest Memories Ever Produced in One Book,"Very rarely do books come out that can be instantly realised as classic pieces of our culture. History of The Game is one such book, carrying you through over a hundred years of the most memorable, most mindboggling, most stunning baseball moments. When you read this book, when you gaze at the pictures, you will be taken back to a time when you sat up with your father to watch the late-night west coast game, when you waved with the crowd in Fenway, when your heart broke with the Sox in '86; when you leaped for joy for the miracle of '69; where you were for McGwire or Maris or Dimaggio. This book is not only full of simply baseball memories, but the memories of our life. It is a must-have for any true fan of the game."
3,mattel should have higher production standards,"While this IS UNO, that's about all it has going for it. The cards are thin and cheap and without decent gloss. The printing on the cards is uneven, faded, and has obvious flaw spots. I expect better quality from Mattel."
5,This game is a classic,I love this game because it's fun and most ages can play it! No complains about the quality of the cards.
3,"Product detail doesn't say it, but this is the small-card version","Just a heads up: if you're looking for the large-format UNO cards you remember, these are not them. The cards here are smallish playing cards, like the old airline playing card decks.Not a big deal, but we were expecting the bigger cards and that's not what this is. I came back to see if we missed something but this product description neatly avoids saying what size the cards are, and they use the big box and ""product size"" fields in such a way that other people may also assume these are the large cards.Just figured I'd let people know."
5,Uno Card Game,This is a great family game. It is easy to play great for the whole family. It comes in a nice box and easy to take with you when you travel. Every family needs at least one Uno Game! I have found the best prices on Uno games on Amazon too.
5,Great and totally addictive!!!!,"When I played this at my grandmother's house, I was hooked! They're these liitle cards that are in four colors and numbered from 1 through 9 and with Reverse, Draw 2, and Wild Cards. It helped my little cousins' math skills and was extremly fun! This is a must buy!"
5,Gift for my Grand-daughter,"I purchased the UNO game for my Grand-daughter to use when she visits. We play when we visit Atlanta, big fun!"
5,Great fun and an unexpected surprise.,"Uno has been around forever, and it's a lot of fun to play so we ordered it for the family to play. The first night we received the cards, my husband and I stayed up late just to play the game. I started looking at the package the cards came in and I noticed that it was the 40th anniversary edition of the game, a pleasant surprise. Also, the cards look just like the classic version. I hate it when they change the face of the cards to make it ""newer"", but these cards look exactly like the originals."
4,The Uno and only.,"I just started playing Uno and it can be a thoroughly entertaining time, depending on the number of people and their general dispositions. The cards are well-made, sturdy, and easy-to-read. The instructions included are detailed and simple to read and comprehend. In fact, we often referred back to the rules for clarification and never found the answer to be ambiguous or unhelpful. Fun."
5,As much fun today as it was 25 years ago,"I first played this game nearly 25 years ago with neighbors and loved it. The game is simple and fun, yet there is an element of strategy involved in when you play the action cards. And like any great game, there has never been a single session when people weren't laughing and having a great time during play. Though it has been years since I first played this fun game, I returned to it recently and play it with my wife about once a week. Even with just two players, we have a great time. I purchased the Uno Original card game on Amazon for a mere $5.49. It has brought us hours of enjoyment. Great game."
2,UNO Card Deck Shipped,"Luckily, the 4 missing cards from the initial purchase were in the extra deck you shipped. However, there are only 108 cards in one UNO card deck. After removing the 4 missing cards from the new UNO card deck you shipped to me, I counted 120 cards left over.THERE IS SOMETHING DEFINITELY WRONG WITH YOUR QUALITY CONTROL SYSTEM!!!"
2,"Great classic, bad update","I've played this game for years and it's still as fun as it ever was. However, this is probably the worst update of the game I've ever seen. Replacing the Draw 2, reverse and skip cards with symbol only cards makes the game extremely confusing for new players. The draw 2 card is the worst out of all of them with a ""+2"" as the symbol, making it easily confused with an actual 2. After playing the game for years, I understood the gane fine, but it was extremely confusibg for new players. I hope they bring the card names back in the next update."
3,Fun especially with 3 or more players!,"Recommendation: BUYPros:. Quick and easy to play. Kids 5yr+ can enjoy the gameCons:. Little to think about, not much strategy. Gets boring after a few playsA few words:It's a good buy if you have kids in the 5 to 7 years range, they will enjoy it, not so much fun for adults, gets boring really quickly. I also played it on Xbox Live with other online players, it's slightly more entertaining since you spend time chatting with others without thinking too much about the game."
5,FUN GAME..BRINGS BACK MY CHILHOOD,"..THE CARDS ARE NICE BUT NOT AS THICK AS THEY USED TO BE WHEN I WAS A KID....THE SKIPS ARE JUST ARROWS..AND IT SAYS +2 OR +4 INSTEAD OF ""DRAW""..THEY USED TO BE SO SELF EXPLANITARY..NOW ITS MOSTLY PICTURES..I TOOK ME A SECOND TO REMEMBER WHAT THE CARDS MEANT...WELL..IT HAS BEEN 15 YRS SINCE I PLAYED..BUT IT COMES WITH DIRECTIONS AND WILL WORK JUST FINE...THE OLD ORIGINAL ""UNO"" CARDS ARE MORE EXPENSIVE AND HARDER TO FIND...THESE ARE STILL WORTH A FEW BUCKS FOR MANY NIGHTS OF FAMILY FUN..."
5,Great purchase for 5 yr old son,This was by far one of my sons favorite christmas gifts which was hard to believe. He is 5 and we play everynight. Its nice to see him playing with something so simple and classic but yet still requires some thinking. Great for a family activity.
4,It's Uno,"Classic card game. I use to love playing this as a kid and now this has become my 6 year old daughters new favorite game. Not sure I am a fan of the special cards ""new look"", but that's probably because I'm use to the classic version."
3,Not The Same Cards I Remember,"Recently I was re-introduced to the marvelous card game called ""Uno"". I love this game. My family used to play it all the time. I decided to order a deck. I am disappointed in the size and thinness of the cards. They also do not have the same graphics as the orignial game that I used to play, which is not a big deal but... Card size is small 3.5"" X 2.25"" compared to the ""original"" cards which were approx 5"" X 7"". I did find the original cards on another site and think I will be happier with these!"
2,Bad Quality,"I love this game so I bought this. However I found the quality was pretty bad. The colors printed are barely even. I mean if you take two red cards you will see they are in different colors! Moreover, the paper I mean the material is also disappointed in quality. And the instructions, fulfilled with Chinese, is a disaster in the box! I would never recommend anyone to buy this stuff."
3,Uno is the Same Game as Crazy-8s!,"Uno is the exact same game as Crazy-8s, the classic card game played for years with a regular deck of playing cards. So, you don't actually need to purchase this deck of cards to enjoy this awesome game. Just look up the rules for Crazy-8's on the internet. And while you're at it, King's Corners and the ""adult"" version of Go Fish (also played with a regular deck) seem to appeal to the same age group of about age 5 to adult. And, by the way, I do love Uno/Crazy-8s and play it all the time with my kids. They learn matching, strategy, and, it's just lots of fun. I recommend it! P. Gould, author of Feeding the Kids: The Flexible, No-Battles, Healthy Eating System for the Whole Family"
2,Too expensive for its quality,I purchased this produce because I thought it must be made by durable material for this price. I really disappointed when I received it.
4,Classic card game,"Easy to grasp, even for the quite young.(It's like a simplified version of Crazy Eights/Jack-Change-It, in case you don't know, but comes with about 120 cards)My daughter loves it.I like that the manufacturer has the foresight to supply several blank cards to use as replacements for ones you'll inevitably lose or damage."
5,Great for all ages 2 and up!,"Yes, I have always taught my children to play this at age 2, and by age three, they are nearly ""experts,"" even learning how to strategize their hands. This is a classic game that never gets old, and I love it as a numbers and colors teaching tool for my preschoolers, even though all my older children and us adults all love to play as well, and have for years!"
5,Our favorite game!!,"We all love this game!! We play it all the time and everyone has a good time, from my 8 year old daughter to my 71 year old dad. It is definitely our favorite game!"
3,NO AWD models,It is a useful book but would be better if it covered All Wheel Drive models. Very thorough and useful otherwise.
5,"Must Have! -- ""Dead Serious"" contributor Penny Aicardi","You truly can't understand the total experience of pregnancy, childbirth, or breastfeeding without reading this book! Sure, you can go out there and get the lowdown on medical ""stuff"" but what fun is that? This book is a great diversion from the so-called popular pregnancy books out there that claim to have the answers to everything. You'll feel better just knowing that we've all been there in uncomfortable, hysterical, and embarrassing situations that those ""other"" books just don't talk about! Besides, after all the uninvited belly rubs, pounds gained, and ""leaking"" breasts - who couldn't use a laugh?"
3,"Fiction, with aliens thrown in","This is only the second Hogan book that I have read. The first, ""Cradle of Saturn"", dealt with somewhat bizarre scientific theories. In this book, he again espouses alternate science theories as the basis of his story.However, The science fiction is ancillary to the story. Hogan wrote a story of intrigue and suspense. The Hyadeans did not have be aliens for the book to work because the plot doesn't hinge on the alien issue. Rather, the book focuses on development of the action caused by conflict in cultures.The story reminds me a lot of a Robert Ludlum plot. Cade is the reluctant hero who experiences a life changing paradigm shift. He is thrown into a world of conflict that he refused to beleive existed. Hogan stresses his development, not the alien presence, to create his plotline. The characterization is well thought out and developed. However, the ending is somewhat predictable and contrived.All in all, it's an enjoyable and easy read."
3,not HIS best...not a waste of time.,"If You've never read Hogan, don't start with this one.If you've enjoyed some of his other Titles, go for It."
1,The Legend that was Earth,"I have bought all of Hogan's novels and enjoyed them all - except this one. I could not believe that this was written by him. It reads like a 1st novel - infact, I would bet that this was a draft from years earlier that he dusted off and brought to market on his name alone because it was not because of the plot or characters.I got all the way throught to the last 30 pages and quit reading the novel. I could not take it any more. I purchase Sci-Fi by authors. I may try Hogan again but I think that I will check the ratings before I do."
2,A good author gone downhill,"For years I've been a fan of James P. Hogan. The man's ""Giant"" novels are teetering on the brink of being classics. His work has consitently shown immagination, wit and intelligence.Unfortunately his last several novels have fallen far short of his earlier promise. I won't review the plot of ""Legend."" Suffice it to say that it is much like many SciFi movies. A good idea ineptly handled.Hogan's world view can be best described as new age libertarianism. He has based his last few novels on premisises that would leave an orthodox scientist rolling on the floor in laughter. His proofs? The government denies. How can one doubt?Jerry"
2,Usual Hogan,"Hogan's at his usual stuff, caring more for the weird tech the characters find than for the characters themselves. The tech itself is a bit interesting, but in recent years he's gone into psuedoscientific theories and that really shows in the ""ether"" t aliens use to travel between stars. I noticed a bit of plagiarizing from ""Guns, Germs and Steel"" as well. Read only if you're a diehard Hogan fan."
4,"an ""I told you so"" Book","This book is one of a few books that unfortunately, not enough took seriously when it was printed. Now, it's an excellent addition to the must - read list of any one interested in nonproliferation. Divided into several sections, the book discusses every facet of nuclear terrorism, the how, the where, and the why. Even if some of the intelligence is dated, it still is well thought out, written and presented. A topical reference for today's climate."
5,Best camping axe I have ever used!,"You can't go wrong with this axe. It is virtually indestructible and holds a great edge. The weight and balance are awesome. It is the perfect length for a camping axe because it fits in my plastic camping container (for car camping) but has almost the same chopping power as a regular length wooden-handled axe, probably because it has about the same weight due to the metal shaft. I like the fact that it comes with a protective leather sheath. Great product!"
3,quality control is slipping,"it is a nice balanced axe. it swings nice. it has a good flow to it. with little trouble i was able to fell a 8"" diameter trunk in about 5 minutes. but, i can see inconsistencies in the metal and some roughness to the grip (like those in the pics). makes you think that quality control is slipping in american plants. i did make contact on one swing that vibrated the axe so badly that it made me stop and inspect it. it was an uneasy feeling. but if this tool is used with respect and knowledge and not treated like a toy it could last a few years. not nearly as long as my estwing hammer that i received from my dad 15 years ago. he had it since the 70s and i still use it to this day."
4,An axe,"While it is a well made Axe, the handle near the blade is thin, so any heavy duty chopping you want to do with it is out the window. It is great for light chopping though."
2,not sure I get what the fuss is about,"To me this is a mediocre axe. Not very heavy, not very sharp, not very balanced, not all that easy to use. A sort of weak compromise among various qualities you want in an axe. It may be good for camping, but for general purposes, I can't recommend it."
2,Visions Of Cody + an editor= On The road,"I read On the Road over 30 years ago in college. I was hooked and within two years I read everything JK had written. I bought a first edition of Visions Of Cody some years later and found it a monumental bore. While I'll nod to the readers that get off on the experimental nature of the prose, for someone like me, who thinks On The Road and The Dharma Bums are almost perfect, Cody is not much more than the rough cut...very rough...for On The Road."
2,From the old Remington Rand direct to you...,"I don't even know what to say about this book other than anyone who pretends to like this nonsense deserves to read it. Truman Capote's quote about Kerouac's writing, ""That it's not writing, it's typing,"" probably sums up the matter better than anything I can say. What disappoints me I suppose is that I really want to like Kerouac - I love the idea of him, though I can't say I care much for his typing."
1,"worst, last Kerouac to read.","As much as I love Kerouac, this one is just too muddled to be of much use. That reviewer who said this hooked him on Kerouac for life scares the hell out of me.There is only so much dope-addled rambling a person can take. When Jack and Cody start tossing nonsense at each other, just mumbling stuff, well, that's an interesting take on poetry for a page or two, but not for hundreds of pages.Read everything else by Kerouac. If that's not enough, then give this a shot. You probably won't finish it anyway. Sure, there's a gem here and there, but it's hardly worth the hunt when there's so much other kick-butt Kerouac out there."
1,"What a ripoff, just buy the movie!",I bought the DVD from the One Six Right website and really enjoyed watching it. It is very well done and has lots of great aviation shots and history shots and stories about Van Nuys airport. Just buy the movie and watch it rather than pay some pompous so and so to tell you what you should think.
1,Please,Pay for a movie review? This may be the dumbest thing I've ever seen on Amazon.Wasn't Terwilliger also Sideshow Bob's last name? Coincidence?
3,Arlo Guthrie Running Down The Road,This is one of the best records from Arlo. The quality of the cd is great. It's a pleasure buy any cd by Amazon.
